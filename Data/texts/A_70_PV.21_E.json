The significant milestone event \r\nwas the adoption by the United Nations of the new set \r\nof Sustainable Development Goals as part of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nOur 17 Sustainable Development Goals are \r\ninspirational and ambitious. They are global in nature \r\nand universally applicable to every United Nations \r\nMember State, developed and developing alike. Every \r\nGoal is important and deserves priority attention. They \r\nare interrelated, they carry equal weight and they all \r\nmatter. Achieving some Goals at the expense of others \r\nis not a preferred option. All Goals must be realized, \r\nwhich should be the overriding objective.\r\nIn my firm belief in the importance of the work \r\nof our Organization, I have tried to attend the annual \r\nGeneral Assembly debates as often as possible since \r\nbecoming Samoa’s Prime Minister. I am therefore \r\nacutely aware of the diversity and gravity of issues \r\nconfronting our Organization and the need sometimes \r\nto refer to them in one’s statement. However, partly in \r\nrecognition of the new Agenda we have now agreed to \r\nimplement and as a gesture to the seventieth anniversary \r\nof our Organization and the imminent danger of climate \r\nchange for small island developing States (SIDS), \r\nmy statement in essence is devoted to Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 13, “Take urgent action to combat \r\nclimate change and its impacts”. That is also a priority \r\ngoal enshrined in the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of \r\nAction (SAMOA) Pathway, the outcome document of \r\nthe third International Conference on SIDS.\r\nClimate change will continue to be the major \r\npreoccupation and priority policy determinant for \r\nSamoa well into the future. I think that the same would \r\nbe true for all our Pacific island countries and the wider \r\nSIDS. Thus, to contextualize our perspective on climate \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.21\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n21st plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 30 September 2015, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nchange, allow me to share with representatives a part of \r\nour narrative.\r\nFirst, here are some givens. Climate change is the \r\nsingle most urgent challenge confronting humankind; it \r\nis facilitated largely by human-induced activities driven \r\nfor the most part by profit motives, with some degree \r\nof insensitivity to the consequences of such action on \r\nothers, particularly those vulnerable to the impacts of \r\nclimate change, who are usually ill-prepared to adapt \r\nand in most cases had barely contributed to the causes \r\nof climate change in the first place.\r\nClimate change is not a future phenomenon. It is \r\nreal, irreversible and is already happening with far \r\nmore frequency. It is no longer a question of when; \r\nrather, it is about the severity of the magnitude of the \r\nimpacts and the full cost society must bear. Even now \r\nin my country, we are suffering drought conditions. \r\nThese will give way to the onset of the cyclone season, \r\nwhich is predicted to have a high likelihood of severe \r\ncyclones in our Pacific region.\r\nAs this is a cross-cutting issue, ambitious actions \r\nor solutions at the national and international levels to \r\ntry to address the root causes of climate change will \r\ninevitably end up either being compromised, watered \r\ndown or put aside due to political, social and economic \r\nconsiderations taking precedence over basic climate \r\nlogic. Climate change is not a concern of small island \r\ndeveloping States alone; it impacts every country, but \r\nsome — such as small island developing States — more \r\nextensively like than others because our capacity to \r\nrespond quickly and effectively is constrained by our \r\nrealities.\r\nIn summary, climate change cannot be wished \r\naway. It is real, irreversible and already happening. \r\nIt has significant security implications and its impact \r\nthreatens the continued existence and viability of some \r\nsmall island developing States. Even those countries \r\nthat to date have been in denial of the climate change \r\nphenomenon must surely now accept the weight of \r\nscientific evidence.\r\nSamoa is a small island developing State of the \r\nPacific, a region recognized and acknowledged as \r\nmost vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Our \r\nislands contributed the least to the causes of climate \r\nchange, yet stand to suffer the most and are least able to \r\nadapt effectively to the adverse impacts.\r\nClimate change is a security risk of far greater \r\nproportions than many people are prepared to admit. For \r\nsome of the low-lying Pacific islands, climate change \r\nmay well lead to their eventual extinction as sovereign \r\nStates. Just a few months ago, I was privileged to \r\nattend the special Security Council open debate on the \r\nsecurity concerns of SIDS (see S/PV.7499). It was an \r\nimportant opportunity to highlight in the Council the \r\nsecurity threat posed by climate change to all our small \r\nisland developing States.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the existential threat \r\nclimate change poses, especially to atolls and low-\r\nlying islands, SIDS have long advocated for ambitious \r\nmitigation efforts to be undertaken by Member States \r\nwith the capacity to do so, and for a global goal of \r\nlimiting the rise in average global temperature to well \r\nbelow 1.5°C in order to prevent some of our low-lying \r\nislands from being submerged by sea-level rise. We \r\nhave also consistently called for a loss and damage \r\nmechanism to be anchored in a new Paris agreement to \r\nbe treated separately from adaptation. With the gradual \r\noperationalization of the Green Climate Fund, we \r\nhave asked SIDS representatives on the Green Climate \r\nFund Board to ensure that the spirit and letter of the \r\ngoverning instrument of the Fund, as they relate to \r\nthose areas that will be beneficial to SIDS, are retained \r\nand not compromised.\r\nOur pleas over the years on the 1.5°C and the loss \r\nand damage caused by climate change have largely \r\ngone unnoticed. At least the countries our messages \r\nhad been intended for have remained unconvinced, but \r\nI hope not uninterested. Part of this, I think, is due to \r\nsome misguided notion that climate phenomena and \r\nrelated events affect small island developing States \r\nonly. Some might have concluded already that climate \r\nchange is not life-threatening and does not affect them, \r\neither because their countries are huge in size or have \r\nwell-developed infrastructure to shield them from any \r\nreal damage from climate change impacts.\r\nIt may also be that there is an implied sense that \r\nif the large problems of the bigger, stronger, more \r\npopulous and well-developed countries are solved, \r\nthen the solutions to the aff lictions of SIDS will \r\nautomatically follow. As a result, challenges facing \r\nSIDS are conveniently viewed by others through the \r\nsame lens that blurs the distinctions and fails to bring \r\nout the truth about the urgency and dire consequences \r\nof the problems we face because of climate change.\r\n15-29701 3/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nBut times are changing and the world has witnessed \r\nin recent months and years an epic outbreak of horrific \r\nnatural disasters unprecedented in the 70-year history of \r\nour Organization. Tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes, \r\nf looding, bush fires and droughts have resulted in the \r\nloss of countless lives and untold sorrow and suffering. \r\nEspecially noteworthy is the fact that developed \r\ncountries are no longer insulated from the reach and \r\ndestructive force of these events. Some countries and \r\nregions have been visited by climate-related and natural \r\nevents like cyclones, bush fires, f looding, earthquakes, \r\nvolcanic eruptions, droughts, tornados, and so on.\r\nWhat is happening across our planet is quite \r\nsignificant because it discredits the perception long held \r\nby some that climate change is a small island developing \r\nStates concern only. Nothing could be further from the \r\ntruth. Events of the recent past have demonstrated that \r\nclimate-related disasters do not discriminate between \r\npoor and rich countries, big or small. Climate change \r\naffects us all, developed and developing countries \r\nalike, although in varying degrees. I submit therefore \r\nthat this realization should shape our overall approach \r\ngoing forward to the Paris Climate Change Conference \r\nin December and beyond. It should, I hope, also help \r\nto shift the focus in the relationship, in the specific \r\ncontext of climate change, from that of donor/recipient \r\nor donor/victim to one of partner/partner in a joint \r\npartnership.\r\nWhile that may sound overly simplified, its real \r\nvalue lies in the change of perspective which this \r\nreorientation should bring and in how we view our \r\nrespective roles when trying to address climate change. \r\nThis, I think, should be beneficial to all. Because we \r\nare now all affected by climate change in one way \r\nor another, that should energize everyone to do their \r\nutmost, either as current or future victims of climate \r\nchange impacts, so as to ensure that we address the root \r\ncauses urgently and in a decisive manner.\r\nAfter all, human nature tells us that when we are \r\nasked to do something for a friend or someone else, \r\nthe impact is not the same because there is no sense of \r\nobligation, commitment or urgency. But when we have \r\nto do something because it will affect us personally, \r\nour children or family, nothing will prevent us from \r\ndoing all that is possible within our power, especially if \r\nit affects our own safety and future. I hope that Member \r\nStates, imbued not just with the projections of science \r\nbut now with the advanced evidence of actual events, \r\nwill be prepared to go the extra mile to do the maximum \r\npossible for their own future survival.\r\nClimate change is a societal problem requiring \r\na decisive response from the global community. It \r\nis a challenge that should unite us, not divide us. No \r\ncountry can deal with this problem alone. We must \r\nwork cooperatively in a partnership of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities and respective capability \r\nif we are to succeed. But true partnerships should \r\nbe underpinned by trust. Without trust, they cannot \r\nbe sustained. Apportioning blame for past wrongs \r\nwould be counterproductive; it would not restore our \r\nenvironment to its pre-industrial state.\r\nClearly we want leaders who view the world as a \r\nsingle constituency where everyone must work together \r\nwithin the limits of their capacity and capability \r\nto be part of the total solution. Sadly, some in our \r\nglobal community have been dismissive and remain \r\nunconvinced. Others, through their actions, have been \r\nindifferent and unsympathetic. But there is hope, \r\nand our whole focus is on Paris. What is needed is \r\nprincipled action. The Paris agreement will require a \r\nnew brand of cooperation and a broader outlook. The \r\nnarrow pursuit of self-interests, the use of economic and \r\npolitical expediencies should be set aside and must not \r\nbe allowed to derail the goal of concluding a universal, \r\nambitious and legally binding agreement.\r\nClimate change is also everyone’s job. While \r\nacknowledging that historical responsibility is real, \r\nallowing it to get in the way of making decisions to \r\nreach a comprehensive agreement would be a grave \r\nmistake. A durable climate change agreement in Paris \r\nwill therefore be a test of multilateral solidarity. Time is \r\nrunning out. The impacts of climate change are getting \r\nworse daily. Playing the blame-and-shame tactics or \r\nwaiting to be led but not willing to lead are no longer \r\noptions, for no single nation, no single group of nations \r\nand no single organization on its own can win the war \r\nagainst climate change. The divergent, yet inextricably \r\nlinked interests of Member States demand that we seal \r\na good deal in Paris.\r\nThe Paris agreement should focus on bold national \r\naction and the inclusion of all stakeholders; it should \r\nbe a timely reminder that no action is too small or \r\ninsignificant. All contributions matter and every \r\naction counts, irrespective of the source. Importantly, \r\nit must place the responsibility of addressing climate \r\nchange squarely on every individual leader in terms of \r\n4/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nwhat national actions he or she can commit to deliver \r\nas his or her country’s contribution to our collective \r\ntask. Samoa is putting the final touches to its intended \r\nnationally determined contributions, which are quite \r\nambitious and will be submitted in due course to the \r\nsecretariat in Bonn.\r\nOften at times we blame others for our misfortunes \r\nand the current status of our development, including \r\nby telling others what they should do, by when and \r\nhow, but rarely saying what we can contribute to make \r\na change. So when my country and our people are \r\ncontinuously exposed to the impacts of climate change, \r\nwe want to be part of the solution by committing to \r\ndoing everything possible for the benefit of our people, \r\nour generation and those to follow. That must be our \r\nuniversal message, simple and unambiguous.\r\nAs for those suggesting that they are implementing \r\nbold actions for the sake of our vulnerable small island \r\ndeveloping States, they should instead be reminded to \r\ntake time to inform their constituencies and supporters \r\nalike, especially those who deny climate change, that \r\nin the final analysis the actions being recommended, if \r\nimplemented, will ultimately benefit their economies, \r\ntheir own people and the survival of their own countries.\r\nThe United Nations remains our last best hope to \r\nprovide the political will and the commitment necessary \r\nto turn the tide against climate change. Samoa calls upon \r\nthose States Members of our Organization in a position \r\nof world leadership to lead the charge in finding and \r\nimplementing solutions to the causes of climate change. \r\nAs present custodians of our world’s environment, we \r\nowe it to our children and future generations to do what \r\nneeds to be done quickly and decisively before we run \r\nout of time. It is therefore imperative to complete the \r\nParis climate agreement in time for the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nin December to adopt an agreement that is ambitious, \r\nuniversally applicable, effective, binding, capable \r\nof swift implementation and universally owned and \r\nrespected by all Member States.\r\nIn the same way that nations in leadership roles are \r\ncalled on to do the right thing for our world, so must \r\nall Member States of the United Nations uphold their \r\npart of the bargain in the work that needs to be done. \r\nWithout that cooperation on the part of all Member \r\nStates, reaching the objectives we all know should be \r\nachieved will continue to elude us.\r\nInternational terrorism is a global menace. It creates \r\nan atmosphere of collective fear and intolerance. It \r\npreys on the innocent, vulnerable and defenceless, and \r\ndisrupts any progress towards peace and development. \r\nTerrorism in all its forms and manifestations should \r\nalways be condemned unreservedly. Over the past \r\nseveral weeks, we have witnessed the tragedy of people \r\nf leeing their countries mired in the destruction from \r\nwar and terrorism. Obviously, a credible and long-\r\nterm response is needed to this grave crisis, which \r\nhas cost so many lives and affected so many people. \r\nThe individual actions of States cannot in themselves \r\nprovide a solution. We must shoulder our responsibility \r\nto act together to meet the threat through the concerted \r\nmultilateral action that underpins the spirit of the \r\nOrganization. Ideally, it must start in the Security \r\nCouncil, which is entrusted with the responsibility of \r\nmaintaining world peace.\r\nThe coherence of the response of the United \r\nNations depends on the work and cooperative spirit \r\nof the Security Council to see the larger picture of the \r\nfuture of our world. The reforms to our Organization \r\nmust therefore be given priority and take account of the \r\nconcerns of our full membership. Our world has enjoyed \r\npeace and security for 70 years by faithfully observing \r\nand following the Charter of our Organization. As \r\nworld leaders, it is our moral duty and responsibility \r\nto ensure that our people continue to live in peace and \r\nharmony for many more years to come.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Haider Al Abadi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Iraq\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Iraq.\r\nMr. Haider Al Abadi, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Iraq, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\n15-29701 5/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Haider Al Abadi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Iraq, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Al Abadi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nseventieth session of the General Assembly is being \r\nheld amidst the grave challenges the world is facing on \r\nmore than one level, especially in fighting terrorism, \r\nforemost among which is the terrorism of the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). We in Iraq stand \r\nsteadfastly and patiently with the world to ward off the \r\nmonstrosity of those whose actions affect our country, \r\nthe region and the world. This is happening, while \r\ninternational efforts continue to strengthen the pillars \r\nof peace and security, promote communication among \r\nthe peoples of the world and attain human development. \r\nThese efforts are all made under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations, which has worked tirelessly to uphold \r\nits major pillars of health care, education and raising \r\nliving standards.\r\nSince the United Nations Development Programme \r\nlaunched its first Human Development Report in \r\n1990, the countries of the world, including Iraq, have \r\nanticipated improvements in their human development \r\nlevels. We have pursued this goal so that people would \r\nbecome the means and targets of the development \r\nprocess. As a result of the f lawed policies of the past \r\ndictatorial regime of Saddam Al-Hussein, the standard \r\nof human development fell after a series of wars that \r\nwere fought by that regime and the deprivations and \r\nsiege that Iraq suffered as a result of international \r\nsanctions.\r\nThe situation improved after the political regime \r\nchanged and once a democratic atmosphere was \r\npromoted, particularly with the assistance provided by \r\nthe United Nations, its specialized agencies and other \r\ninternational organizations. Our national institutions \r\ntried to bridge the development gap in fulfilment of \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) adopted \r\nby the leaders of the world at the General Assembly in \r\n2000 by concentrating on targets that were supposed to \r\nhave been achieved by 2015.\r\nWe in Iraq made tangible progress in decreasing \r\nmortality rates, increasing school enrolment, reducing \r\ngender inequality and improving living standards. \r\nHowever the ill-will of terrorist groups, foremost \r\namong which are Al-Qaida and ISIS, as well as those \r\nassociated with the old Ba’ath regime who joined them, \r\nobstructed our development process and spread death \r\nand destruction on our people and infrastructure. In \r\npersisting in their atrocities, those terrorists did not \r\ndistinguish between an infant and an elderly person, \r\nor between a man and a woman. These evil forces \r\nterrorized civilians throughout Iraq and pursued a \r\npolicy of ethnic cleansing, particularly in those areas \r\nthat they claimed to support. Many people who once \r\nlived in the western and northern parts of Iraq are today \r\nrefugees or displaced internally by these merciless \r\ngangsters. They are suffering with those who are still \r\nbesieged in their villages and cities.\r\nWhile we highly appreciate the support and \r\nsolidarity extended to us by the United Nations and \r\nthe international community in our just war against \r\nterrorism, we also recognize the tireless efforts made to \r\nrestore stability to the regions that have been liberated \r\nby our armed forces, the popular mobilization forces and \r\nthe tribal fighters. We also look forward to an effective \r\ncontribution on the part of countries and international \r\norganizations to repairing our infrastructure and \r\nhelping our reconstruction efforts.\r\nDespite all this, Iraq is pursuing its democratic \r\npolicies to promote respect for the Constitution, the \r\npeaceful transition of power, freedom of expression, \r\nand the elimination of racial ethnic and sectarian \r\ndiscrimination. Despite the challenges, we are aware \r\nof public demands and have worked to establish an \r\norganizational framework known as the Popular \r\nMobilization Committee, which receives its instructions \r\nfrom the President of the Republic and the armed \r\nforces. Thus, the popular mobilization forces operate \r\nwithin the law as they fight terrorists and organized \r\ncrime, particularly those who carry arms outside the \r\nframework of the State. The Iraqi Constitution bans \r\ncarrying arms outside the legal framework of the State.\r\nThe Iraqi security forces protect demonstrators \r\nand give them full freedom to express their demands. \r\nWhile we may be in a state of war, many governorates \r\nhave peaceful demonstrations and there are excellent \r\nrelations between the demonstrators and the security \r\nforces. This is a unique experience indeed. I personally \r\ndecided to entrust a working task force to follow up the \r\ndemands of the demonstrators so that we can assist in \r\nimplementing these demands.\r\nThe Iraqi Council of Representatives has enacted \r\nthe Government’s programme of work. The Council \r\nrepresents the Iraqi people. We have adopted a \r\n6/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nprogressive vision of reform, sanctioned by the highest \r\nreligious authority. We have listened to the demands \r\nthat our people expressed over the past two months. We \r\nhave therefore provided economic, administrative and \r\nfinancial reform packages. We have started working \r\nto invigorate the private sector in our country. We \r\nhave provided financing for small and medium-sized \r\nprojects, despite the difficulties we experienced after \r\nthe huge drop in oil revenues, which account for \r\n92 per cent of our income. The reform package was \r\nrespectfully accepted by our people, who expressed \r\ntheir views in detail. The reform enjoys the support of \r\nthe highest religious authorities and other stakeholders \r\nin society. We are determined to pursue our reform \r\nwithout disregarding our important role in directing the \r\nsecurity and military effort to fight ISIS.\r\nOn behalf of the Iraqi people, I should like to salute \r\nthe efforts of the brotherly and friendly countries in \r\nthe international coalition in our war against terror. \r\nProviding more support is very important because it is \r\nthe Iraqis who are fighting this war. We therefore thank \r\nthe brotherly countries that have provided assistance, \r\nbut would request further assistance to address the \r\nproblems of refugees. Increased logistical and military \r\nsupport would bring us closer to our ultimate victory \r\nand promote peace and security in all countries of the \r\nworld.\r\nIraq understood the importance of international \r\nefforts to draft a new development document to be \r\nadopted by the United Nations after the Millennium \r\nDeclaration. Iraqi experts and national institutions \r\nparticipated in the international efforts made in our \r\nregion to draft the new Declaration adopted in the \r\ncontext of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1). The importance of the Declaration is \r\nnot limited to the pursuit of development for the human \r\nindividual. It focuses on sustainability, which includes \r\nadvocating a clean environment, the preservation of the \r\nrights of future generations, the promotion of peace and \r\nsecurity, the elimination of poverty and discrimination, \r\nimproving the health and educational standards of \r\nchildren and achieving wider freedoms, living in peace \r\nand bridging the gap between the poor and the rich. \r\nThese are only some of the reforms that we are trying \r\nto attain in Iraq today by bridging these gaps and by \r\nredressing the injustice experienced by many sectors in \r\nour society and the world.\r\nThe important items included in the post-2015 \r\nSustainable Development Goals and their achievement \r\nby 2030 require us all to work more tirelessly to achieve \r\nfurther cooperation among the peoples and countries of \r\nthe world, instead of fighting each other. That would \r\nprovide the United Nations with sufficient opportunity \r\nto work constructively in order to expedite the \r\nachievement of these objectives and share its expertise \r\nthrough programmes to be undertaken throughout the \r\nworld. Iraq will earnestly and enthusiastically work to \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals within the \r\ntime frame assigned. We know that this development \r\nwill affect not just Iraq alone but all countries, because \r\nno country can achieve sustainable development unless \r\nit is enjoyed by neighbouring countries as well.\r\nIraq expects all countries of the world to implement \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014) \r\nand 2199 (2015), which call for ending all support, \r\nfinancing and arming to terrorist groups. I also cite \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 69/281, adopted on \r\n25 May 2015 to salvage the cultural heritage of Iraq, the \r\nimplementation of which would allow Iraq to rebuild its \r\ncountry and achieve development.\r\nThe Government and people of Iraq understand \r\nthe importance of communicating with the peoples \r\nand Governments of the world. We are eager to build \r\npeace and understanding in our region, and therefore \r\nwe seek to open prospects for new relations with the \r\ncountries of the region and to promote such relations \r\nwithout interfering in the internal affairs of others so \r\nas to guarantee a bright future for us all.\r\nThe political process in Iraq is democratic and \r\ngoverned by the peaceful turnover of power. Five \r\nGovernments have succeeded each other in Iraq; our \r\nGovernment is the latest of these and therefore takes \r\npride in our democratic processes. However, there are \r\npolitical blocs that have different points of view. We are \r\nproud of the fact that others have the right to express \r\ntheir opinions, which shows that there is a political \r\nsphere for the free expression of opinion.\r\nOur problem in Iraq is not an internal one. Our \r\nproblem is that a terrorist group has crossed our border \r\nfrom a neighbouring country. That organization is \r\nsupported and armed by others, has occupied vast areas \r\nof Iraq and killed thousands of Iraqis and violated \r\ntheir rights. ISIS continues to recruit thousands of \r\nvolunteers from throughout the world, but particularly \r\nfrom countries that have stressed their solidarity with \r\nIraq. This terrorist organization receives assistance and \r\nweapons and continues to fight us, so our problem is \r\n15-29701 7/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nreally an external one, embodied in the support enjoyerd \r\nby such terrorist organizations.\r\nWhile the popular mobilization forces in Iraq \r\nare a legitimate organization that is supported by the \r\nIraqi State, ISIS and associated entities are illegitimate \r\nterrorist groups that do not respect the State or the \r\nlaw and kill anyone who happens to think differently. \r\nEven those who happen to confess the same faith have \r\nbeen killed and displaced by ISIS. More than 3 million \r\npeople have been displaced by ISIS from the cities \r\nthey once called home. We are eager to build relations \r\nwith our neighbouring countries. We respect their \r\nsovereignty and do not interfere in their internal affairs. \r\nWe therefore call on them to promote the same quality \r\nof relationship. We want them not to interfere in our \r\naffairs and to respect Iraqi sovereignty and our right to \r\nuphold the sanctity of Iraqi lives.\r\nIn conclusion, I thank the United Nations and \r\nother international organizations for supporting Iraq’s \r\nefforts to achieve development, and salute the efforts of \r\ninternational organizations and all other world leaders \r\nand their representatives. It is truly my hope that next \r\nyear we will meet in better circumstances. I urge all \r\ncountries of the region to work together to achieve \r\npeace instead of killing and destruction. We believe \r\nthat each and every leader of the region must assume \r\nresponsibility to stop the bloodshed. The leaders of the \r\nregion have a responsibility to end this killing, which is \r\nan evil visited on humanity at large.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Iraq for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Haider Al Abadi, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Iraq, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Valeriu Strelet, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Moldova\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Moldova.\r\nMr. Valeriu Strelet, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Moldova, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Valeriu Strelet, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Moldova, and inviting him \r\nto address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Strelet (Moldova): I am most delighted and \r\nindeed honoured to represent my country for the first \r\ntime at this high rostrum and to address the General \r\nAssembly at this anniversary session. The seventieth \r\nanniversary of the signing of the Charter of the United \r\nNations gives us the opportunity to learn lessons from \r\nthe past and to reflect on the ways and means we need \r\nto face today’s and tomorrow’s challenges and build \r\ntogether a better future for the coming generations.\r\nWe are all proud that today the United Nations \r\nremains the leader in maintaining peace and security and \r\npromoting sustainable development and human rights. \r\nThe Organization also remains durably at the core of \r\neffective multilateralism, the prominent confirmation \r\nof which is the outcome document ( resolution 70/1) of \r\nthe United Nations Summit on the adoption of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, held a few days ago here in \r\nNew York.\r\nIn that respect, I have great pleasure in highlighting \r\nthe fact that, throughout the entire preparatory process \r\nand during the Summit, the Republic of Moldova \r\nadvocated the adoption of the new development road \r\nmap, which bears on the present and future of our \r\nplanet. The integration of the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental pillars of the new framework Agenda \r\nis the key to an old issue that the United Nations \r\nhas debated for years — the essence of sustainable \r\ndevelopment and how to put it into practice.\r\nWith the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the United Nations and its Member States \r\nare engaging in an advanced model of sustainable \r\ndevelopment for humankind that will address poverty \r\nand inequality and combat climate change. We support \r\nthe United Nations and Member States’ initiatives and \r\nactions directed at addressing climate change through \r\nambitious measures to promote clean power at the \r\nnational and international levels. We believe that if \r\neveryone put their shoulders to the wheel, we would \r\nbe more likely to reach the targets and create a better \r\nworld.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova is making its own \r\ncontribution to the effort. The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals constitute an important chapter in the governing \r\nprogramme for the future. Among many of our \r\nendeavours, we seek to increase the ratio of domestic \r\nrenewable energy consumption to 20 per cent by \r\n2020 and to promote a green economy. My country \r\nis on track to ratify the Low-Emission Development \r\n8/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nStrategies and Plans and, at the twenty-first session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Paris, \r\nintends to support the European Union’s mechanisms for \r\nreaching these goals. Moreover, the implementation of \r\nthe European Union-Moldova Association Agreement, \r\nconcluded last year in Brussels along with the Deep \r\nand Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) as its \r\ncomponent part, represents the strategic direction that \r\ncomplements our sustainable development efforts.\r\nThe European Union agenda and the United \r\nNations commitments go hand in hand and embody \r\nour affiliation with the universality of goals and \r\nresponsibilities for development and peace by way of \r\nembracing European core values and principles and \r\nstrengthening our partnerships in the region. The first \r\nanniversary of our Association Agreement with the \r\nEuropean Union entitles us to assert that the progress \r\nachieved in different fields confirms once again the \r\nsagacity of the choice made by the Republic of Moldova \r\non its way forward to European integration. The \r\ngradual implementation of the Association Agreement \r\nand the creation of the DCFTA zone have brought us \r\npolitically and economically closer to the European \r\nUnion and helped us to advance in the development and \r\nmodernization of the country and of Moldovan society \r\nin the spirit of European and universal values.\r\nAlthough the Republic of Moldova, given its \r\ngeographical position and dimensions, does not often \r\nmanage to influence the international agenda, our \r\nexperience in migration managing, gained during the \r\nimplementation of the action plan for liberalizing the \r\nvisa regime and the Mobility Partnership, allowed \r\nus to become, inter alia, an important voice in the \r\nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development and \r\nin the discussions on the United Nations post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda.\r\nNevertheless, much remains to be done. Reiterating \r\nthe commitment assumed by the Republic of Moldova \r\nto continuing reforms and bringing the country \r\ninto the big European family, we are fully open to a \r\nfurther efficient dialogue with our European partners \r\non the implementation of our priorities, including \r\nmacrofinancial stabilization, reform of the judiciary \r\nand prosecution systems, the fight against corruption, \r\ndeepening reform of public administration, education \r\nand social areas, and the consolidation of cooperation \r\nin ensuring energy security and the interconnection of \r\ntransport networks. This progress has been achieved \r\nwith the help of our development partners, and we are \r\ngrateful to the European Union and its member States, \r\nespecially our neighbour, Romania, and to the United \r\nStates for their continued financial and technical \r\nassistance and unprecedented political support.\r\nFrom the same perspective, in attaining the strategic \r\nobjectives of European integration and the sustainable \r\nsocioeconomic development of the country we also \r\ncount on the support of all development partners and \r\nUnited Nations funds, programmes and specialized \r\nagencies. In this respect, the cooperation and assistance \r\nprogrammes of the International Monetary Fund and \r\nthe World Bank are of invaluable importance to my \r\ncountry. We firmly believe that, with the support and \r\nassistance of our development partners, we will firmly \r\npursue the path of European integration.\r\nThe world we live in is becoming increasingly \r\nturbulent and unsafe. Illegitimate military force and \r\nother forms of violence are widely used by States and \r\nnon-State actors as a means to promote their interests. \r\nGross violations of international law and a dramatic \r\ndecrease in trust among States have already undermined \r\nthe central pillars of the international system.\r\nRegrettably, after a period of relative stability, \r\nthe system of security and cooperation in Europe has \r\nbeen seriously shaken. The annexation of Crimean \r\nby the Russian Federation, in f lagrant violation of \r\ninternational law, and the outbreak of armed conflict \r\nin the eastern regions of the Ukraine have directly \r\nchallenged international peace and security. These \r\nmajor negative developments have reactivated a \r\nfundamental question on our agenda: What should be \r\ndone to restore order and ensure respect for the norms \r\nand principles of international law?\r\nThe search for an answer will take time, but this \r\nexercise is very much needed. In the meantime, it is \r\ncritical to bring the military hostilities in the Donbas \r\nregion of Ukraine to an end. The continuation of the \r\nconflict will cause more suffering, more victims and \r\nmore destroyed infrastructure. There is one simple \r\ntruth to be kept in mind — the longer a conflict goes \r\non, the harder it is to find a sustainable solution. In this \r\nrespect, the Republic of Moldova supports the peaceful \r\nsettlement of the conflict in Donbas in accordance with \r\nthe Minsk agreements and respect for the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of the Ukraine. We express our \r\nsolidarity with the Ukrainian people at this difficult \r\ntime.\r\n15-29701 9/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nThe Republic of Moldova has also gone through a \r\nconflict. For more than two decades, my country has \r\nbeen divided as a result of the Transnistrian conflict. \r\nBut in spite of external and domestic challenges, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova will firmly pursue the peaceful \r\nsettlement of this conflict. By restoring trust and \r\npromoting dialogue, we should move step by step \r\nto a comprehensive resolution of the Transnistrian \r\nconflict. The solution should be based on respect for \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic \r\nof Moldova, and on identifying a special status for \r\nthe Transnistrian region within the internationally \r\nrecognized borders of my country. We express our \r\nhope that all our external partners will make efforts \r\nto advance the conflict-resolution process towards that \r\ngoal.\r\nAdditionally, we reiterate our firm position with \r\nregard to the imperative of Russia’s withdrawing \r\nits military forces and munitions from the territory \r\nof the Republic of Moldova, in accordance with \r\nthe constitutional provisions of my country and \r\ninternational commitments. In the same context, we \r\nbelieve that the existing peacekeeping operation has \r\nfulfilled its mandate and needs to be transformed into a \r\ncivilian mission with a relevant international mandate.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova fully supports all \r\nmeasures taken by the United Nations in the field \r\nof combating international terrorism, promoting \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, and pleads for \r\nthe active participation of all Member States in their \r\nimplementation. My country has ratified and our \r\ndelegation has deposited with the Secretary-General \r\nits ratification instrument of the Arms Trade Treaty. \r\nThe Treaty should not only ensure transparency and \r\naccountability in transfers of conventional weapons, but \r\nshould also prevent illicit arms trafficking, especially \r\nto unrecognized separatist entities. In the context of \r\nthe complex security situation in the Eastern European \r\nregion, this is of vital importance.\r\nBeing convinced that the security deterioration in \r\nour region calls for an effective mechanism for small \r\narms and light weapons control, we are also engaged in \r\nimplementing the United Nations Programme of Action \r\nto Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in \r\nSmall Arms and Light Weapons in All Its Aspects, \r\nand support the relevant Security Council resolutions. \r\nToday, we are pleased to state that during the past \r\nthree years, with the support of our partners, we have \r\nsucceeded in destroying all stocks of cluster munitions \r\nand anti-personnel mines in our country.\r\nWe also share the international community’s \r\nconcerns about the emergence of new terrorist threats to \r\nour democratic values, human rights and world peace. \r\nAs a sponsor of Security Council resolution 2178 (2014) \r\non foreign terrorist fighters, the Republic of Moldova \r\nis in favour of the adoption of appropriate measures \r\nfor its implementation. In the same vein, apart from \r\nthe fact that the Republic of Moldova has participated \r\nfor many years with military observers in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nLiberia, the Sudan, South Sudan and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, starting from 2014 our country has \r\ncontributed a contingent of more than 40 servicemen to \r\nthe multinational peacekeeping Kosovo Force.\r\nDuring the past year, important progress has also \r\nbeen made in cooperating with the European Union \r\nin the field of a common security and defence policy, \r\nparticularly by participating for the first time in the \r\nEuropean Union-led crisis management missions and \r\noperations including the European Union Training \r\nMission in Mali in 2014 and the European Union \r\nMilitary Advisory Mission in the Central African \r\nRepublic in 2015. Thus, the Republic of Moldova \r\nis transitioning from being a security observer and \r\nbeneficiary to becoming an active participant and \r\ncontributor to establishing security building, peace and \r\nstability in Europe and in the world. As a European \r\nUnion-associated State, the Republic of Moldova is \r\ndetermined to contribute to the consolidation of the \r\nEuropean Union’s position as a regional and global \r\nactor.\r\nWhen humankind is confronted with deepening \r\ncrises, raising increasing human rights implications, \r\nand the needs of people are evolving, United Nations \r\nexpertise and independent assessment are crucial. \r\nEspecially for that reason, the Republic of Moldova \r\nwelcomes the innovative approach of the United \r\nNations Office of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights to brief Member States on new developments \r\nin a prompt manner, which will contribute to \r\nstrengthening prevention and early warning. My \r\ncountry stands for universal respect for the principles \r\nof international law and human rights that arise from \r\ntheir indivisibility and interdependence, and believes \r\nthat ensuring the availability of efficient, solid and \r\nrapid reaction mechanisms to foster respect for and \r\n10/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\npromote fundamental freedoms without exception is of \r\ncrucial importance.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary could and should \r\nbecome an influential incentive for further real reforms \r\nand for the reaffirmation and strengthening of the \r\nrole and work of the United Nations. We welcome and \r\nsupport every concrete effort directed at ensuring the \r\nreform of all United Nations structures, including the \r\nGeneral Assembly, its subsidiary bodies, the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the Security Council, with the \r\npurpose of enhancing their efficiency, effectiveness, \r\naccountability, transparency and equitable regional \r\nrepresentation. Along this line, we particularly reiterate \r\npreviously expressed positions on the imperative \r\nof allocating one non-permanent seat in a reformed \r\nSecurity Council to the Eastern European Group of \r\nStates and of ensuring equitable regional rotation in \r\nthe process of the election of the Secretary-General \r\nby entrusting for the first time the highest position in \r\nthe Secretariat to a national coming from an Eastern \r\nEuropean country.\r\nFinally, having had this privilege of congratulating \r\nthe entire United Nations family on the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Organization, we express our \r\nconviction that all Member States will further engage by \r\nuniting efforts and resources to confront the new threats \r\nand challenges, thereby safeguarding peace, humanity \r\nand our planet, as the founders of the United Nations \r\nurged us to do. Pledging to constructively contribute to \r\nthe attainment of this noble assignment, my delegation \r\nand my country are confident that this anniversary \r\nsession will lead to the advancement of sustainable \r\npeace and development and to environmental and \r\nhuman rights protection for the benefit of the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Valeriu Strelet, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Moldova, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Prince Moulay \r\nRachid of Morocco\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Royal Highness Prince Moulay \r\nRachid of Morocco.\r\nPrince Moulay Rachid (Morocco) (spoke in \r\nArabic): King Mohammed VI has mandated me \r\nto convey his congratulations, his esteem and his \r\ngreetings. He also asked me to deliver this royal speech \r\nto the General Assembly at its seventieth session.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly is \r\nparticularly important because it has seen the adoption \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1). It is an opportunity to reiterate our \r\ncollective commitment to achieving one of the lofty \r\nobjectives of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nto fulfil the aspirations of peoples throughout the \r\nworld. This session also coincides with the celebration \r\nof the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nestablishment at a time when the international \r\ncommunity is facing serious, unprecedented challenges \r\nand challenges that require joint, efficient and integrated \r\naction. The Kingdom of Morocco’s position regarding \r\nthese challenges and the spectrum of regional and \r\ninternational issues will be laid out during the General \r\nAssembly’s committee meetings and at the ministerial \r\ndiscussions that will take place on the sidelines of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe preparation of the development Agenda for the \r\nnext 15 years must be based on an objective assessment \r\nof what we have done since 2000. Have we managed to \r\nimprove the day-to-day life of the poor? Are the results \r\nachieved solid and sustainable enough to withstand \r\ntensions, wars and social and economic crises? The \r\nreview of the Millennium Development Goals shows \r\nthat tangible progress has been made between 1990 and \r\n2015, yet the remaining gaps among regions throughout \r\nthe world and within certain countries remain a \r\nlegitimate cause of concern. This situation tarnishes \r\nthe image of international cooperation and casts doubt \r\non our collective action within the United Nations.\r\nBut that does not necessarily mean that we have \r\nfailed. This situation should rather lead all stakeholders \r\nto consider the best means to promote development and \r\nto correct the malfunctions that affect international \r\ncooperation. In this context, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\nhopes that the Sustainable Development Goals will \r\ncontribute to developing an ambitious Agenda that can \r\nimprove the situation at all levels — national, regional \r\nand international.\r\nHowever relevant and promising the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Agenda is, its credibility will depend \r\non our ability to find the financing necessary for its \r\nimplementation. International cooperation therefore \r\nhas to keep pace with the new international reality. \r\n15-29701 11/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nIt needs to shake off the legacy and geopolitical \r\ncalculations of the past and refrain from imposing near \r\nimpossible conditions for accessing support. The Ebola \r\ncrisis showed that besides expressions of solidarity \r\ndictated by circumstance, the international support \r\nto the countries affected was far from sufficient and \r\ndid not rise to the level of commitment required by the \r\ngravity of the situation.\r\nDevelopment does not come through bureaucratic \r\ndecisions or by means of technical reports that \r\nlack credibility. Development requires the deep \r\nunderstanding of the realities of peoples’ existence and \r\ntheir characteristic capacities, as well as an objective \r\nanalysis of the context in which they live. It also \r\nrequires serious work to respond to their aspirations \r\nand genuine concerns.\r\nI am very familiar with the difficult situation in \r\nAfrica and I think I know what I am talking about. \r\nMany Africans are indeed living in very difficult \r\nconditions. The reality is infinitely more cruel and bitter \r\nthan is indicated in the reports of some international \r\ngovernmental and non-governmental organizations. \r\nThe life of these Africans is a struggle and subject to \r\ndaily challenges and scant resources, but at the same \r\ntime they live with dignity and have a sincere patriotic \r\ncommitment to a better future.\r\nTo address this situation, we must develop an \r\ninclusive and consistent mid-term approach with \r\ncomplementary measures. Urgent, practical initiatives \r\nare also required because deteriorating conditions \r\nand daily pressing needs cannot wait for international \r\nbureaucracy to wake up and take the necessary \r\ndecisions. From that perspective, Africa must be at the \r\nheart of international development cooperation in order \r\nto help the continent free itself from its colonial past \r\nand unlock its potential. Morocco therefore calls on the \r\nUnited Nations and regional and international financial \r\ninstitutions to draft an action plan for the economic \r\ntransformation of Africa and the provision of steady \r\nresources for its financing.\r\nDespite its promise, Africa stands at a crossroads \r\nbecause without substantial and tangible international \r\nsupport, the continent will major inequalities will emerge \r\namong its countries. Some countries will progress and \r\ndevelop while others continue to have problems and \r\nsink into poverty, ignorance and instability. We call for \r\npeace and stability to be made top priorities in order to \r\nprevent conflicts, tackle extremism and terrorism, and \r\nresolve the migration problem through an approach that \r\ntakes into account the dignity of migrants, preserves \r\ntheir basic rights, and addresses the root causes of this \r\nphenomenon.\r\nThis year in my country, we are celebrating the \r\ntenth anniversary of our national human development \r\ninitiative, which has contributed to reducing poverty, \r\nmarginalization, exclusion and interregional \r\ndisparities. It also enabled Morocco to achieve \r\nMillennium Development Goal 1 in 2013. International \r\norganizations have therefore ranked Morocco third \r\namong the five countries in the world to have adopted \r\nthe best public welfare programmes and initiatives. \r\nWe are ready to put our experience in this field at the \r\nservice of our partners, in particular in Africa.\r\nBecause of its geographical location and its strategic \r\nchoices, the Kingdom of Morocco is actively involved \r\nin addressing all global issues and concerns, including \r\nmigration, human rights, climate change, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the fight against terrorism. Morocco \r\nnational response to each has made a sound contribution \r\nto international efforts to face these unprecedented \r\nglobal challenges.\r\nMorocco’s commitment to addressing these \r\nuniversal issues is reflected particularly in the fight \r\nagainst climate change, one of the most serious threats \r\nfacing humankind as a whole. We participated in the \r\nRio Summit in 1992 and have since worked to develop \r\na national environmental policy based on involving \r\nall relevant stakeholders and on the effective use of \r\nfinancial resources dedicated to climate issues. This \r\npolicy is reflected in our adoption of a national charter \r\nfor environment and sustainable development and in \r\nthe Green Morocco Plan as well as in our ambitious \r\nprogrammes for solar and wind renewable energy, \r\nwhich aim to meet 42 per cent of Morocco’s energy \r\nneeds by 2020.\r\nWe are also faithfully meeting our commitments \r\nin the field of the environment, and in 2015 officially \r\npresented our intended nationally determined \r\ncontribution. This includes strong and ambitious \r\ncommitments to its participation in setting up an \r\ninternational environmental order that is fair and \r\nsolidarity based. In this respect Morocco is proposing \r\nto host in Marrakesh in 2016 the twenty-second \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change.\r\n12/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nWe should like to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nour support for France’s efforts to achieve a global, \r\ncomprehensive, sustainable, balanced and legally \r\nbinding agreement at the twenty-first session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. Therefore \r\nwe see the Paris and Marrakesh Conferences as two \r\ncomplementary steps towards making a qualitative \r\nimprovement in the fight against climate change \r\nand avoiding previous failures caused by a lack of \r\ncoordination and cooperation among stakeholders.\r\nWe therefore stress the importance of the call issued \r\non 20 September in Tangier by Morocco, together with \r\nPresident François Hollande of France, for collective, \r\nsolidarity-based international action on climate change. \r\nThe choice of Morocco to launch this joint initiative \r\nwas not incidental but a demonstration of the esteem \r\nin which our country is held in its position at the \r\nvanguard of the efforts of African nations to adopt \r\nefficient national strategies in the field of renewable \r\nenergy. Consistent with this solidarity-based policy, \r\nMorocco will spare no effort to broadcast the voices \r\nand concerns of the African continent and the small \r\nisland developing States, which are the most vulnerable \r\nto climate change.\r\nThe United Nations is today celebrating its \r\nseventieth anniversary and has reached the age of \r\nmaturity, wisdom and responsibility. Those same \r\nprinciples and values should govern the action of the \r\ninternational community in resolving the regional \r\ndisputes it faces. The Organization’s work must not be \r\na destabilizing factor for countries that contribute to \r\nmultilateral cooperation and action. Morocco therefore \r\nrejects any irresponsible or risky course of action with \r\nregard to the regional dispute over the Moroccan Sahara. \r\nIndeed, many international Powers fully realize that the \r\nunrealistic plans that have been drawn up inside offices \r\nand the erroneous proposals that have been made can \r\nonly undermine the situation in the region.\r\nWe have high hopes that the United Nations will \r\nmaintain its efforts to resolve disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans and remain committed to upholding the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States in order \r\nto establish the peace, security and stability to which \r\nthe peoples of the world aspire.\r\nAddress by Mr. Lionel Zinsou, Prime \r\nMinister in Charge of Economic Development, \r\nEvaluation of Public Policies and the Promotion \r\nof Good Governance of the Republic of Benin\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister in Charge of Economic Development, \r\nEvaluation of Public Policies and the Promotion of \r\nGood Governance of the Republic of Benin.\r\nMr. Lionel Zinsou, Prime Minister in Charge of \r\nEconomic Development, Evaluation of Public \r\nPolicies and the Promotion of Good Governance of \r\nthe Republic of Benin, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Lionel \r\nZinsou, Prime Minister in Charge of Economic \r\nDevelopment, Evaluation of Public Policies and the \r\nPromotion of Good Governance of the Republic \r\nof Benin, and inviting him to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Zinsou (Benin) (spoke in French): The \r\nOrganization turns 70 this year, and on this birthday we \r\nwelcome its call for a “Strong United Nations, Better \r\nWorld”. This celebration is an opportunity to welcome \r\nand take stock of all the progress made in promoting \r\nthe fundamental principles of the Charter. The goals \r\nand ideals of the Organization today face a globalized \r\nand often dangerous world that is experiencing a \r\nturbulent time in its history. We are in a multipolar \r\nworld. Climate change has become tangible in terms \r\nof its harmful effects, especially on the least developed \r\ncountries. Fortunately, there is public opinion and there \r\nare peoples with aspirations for a prosperous, long-term \r\nfuture who know how to achieve it.\r\nI commend the President of the General Assembly on \r\nhis personal qualities. His country, Denmark, where he \r\nis a senior leader, continues to be very close to countries \r\nsuch as our own. He is an excellent Ambassador to the \r\nUnited Nations and of the international community’s \r\nresolve to stand in solidarity.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to the outgoing President of \r\nthe General Assembly, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa \r\nfrom the brother country of Uganda. His personal \r\nqualities allowed undeniable progress to be made and \r\nstrong consensus to be reached on important issues. I \r\npay tribute to him together with the current President.\r\nWhen it comes to peace, security and human \r\nrights — the themes of this seventieth general \r\ndebate — we are certain that considerable progress has \r\n15-29701 13/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nbeen made but it is still possible to go further. That \r\nis what we want to discuss. Yes, our world has made \r\nconsiderable progress, but the threat of terrorism has \r\nbeen mentioned many times from this rostrum. Just \r\na few minutes ago, we heard about its prevalence in \r\nIraq, but we also know it from our own experience in \r\nAfrica. There is strong financial instability and crises \r\nin Africa — food crises, energy crises, mass youth \r\nunemployment — that are affecting the youngest and \r\nthe oldest in all countries. There are pandemics, that \r\nother globalization of the day. There are the rising \r\nsea levels and coastal erosion that we feel as a coastal \r\ncountry,.\r\nClearly everyone has their own challenges, but the \r\nUnited Nations system is at the front line and we are \r\nproud and confident in the United Nations action. We \r\nalso have problems that run deep in all our countries \r\nconcerning good governance, which sometimes poses \r\nmajor obstacles to development policies and good \r\nresponses to the challenges of the day. They need to be \r\naddressed.\r\nThe Addis Ababa Action Agenda opens new \r\npossibilities of cooperation for Africa in combating \r\nthe vast international corruption that is hitting us hard \r\nwith mass tax evasion and illicit financial f lows. The \r\nstruggle against such corruption requires a coordinated \r\njudicial effort. We need to counter its harmful, far-\r\nreaching effects. It is an obstacle to growth and to \r\ninvestment. We must deny the perpetrators of economic \r\nand financial crimes the possibility of taking refuge in \r\nthe sanctuaries of tax havens. We are pleased that the \r\nUnited Nations system, working with the Group of 20, \r\nis coordinating with the full commitment of the African \r\nUnion to combat this corruption.\r\nBut in each of our countries, we know that \r\ncorruption at the domestic level is also a very important \r\nhindrance. Benin has decided to address it and attack \r\nit using institutional means by establishing, through \r\na law enacted in 2011, an effective national authority \r\nfor combating corruption, and in 2015 a general audit \r\noffice designed to improve administrative practices. \r\nWith the help of its technical and financial partners \r\nand the United Nations system, which has been very \r\nvigilant and very effective, Benin seeks justice to find \r\nbetter means to prosecute and eradicate the impunity \r\nthat often goes with corruption at the domestic level, \r\neven in the institutions of the Republic itself.\r\nIf we look at things more broadly, we hope that the \r\nUnited Nations, which has helped us in all these subjects, \r\nwill be ever more effective in conflict resolution. No \r\nState, powerful though it may be, can prevent or resolve \r\nconflict alone. On our continent, the security issue is \r\never present. It is a serious obstacle to the development \r\nof the countries in the grip of these conflicts. Often \r\nit is a reflection on our borders and our territory of \r\nconflicts that in reality are cross-border in nature. They \r\nare often linked to religious fundamentalism, all kinds \r\nof terrorism, human trafficking, drug smuggling, and \r\nmaritime piracy.\r\nAfrica knows these problems. Africa is getting \r\norganized but needs the help of the rest of the world. We \r\nstill need security assistance, which is a primary and \r\ncritical priority component of development assistance. \r\nOur country advocates a comprehensive approach to \r\ncooperation among States that is political, economic, \r\nlegal and diplomatic. We find that such assistance is \r\nmaking solid progress, especially among African \r\ncountries or between Africa and other continents, with \r\nthe United Nations system as guarantor and stakeholder.\r\nSimilarly, we wish to stand in solidarity and also \r\nbe an actor. It will be noted that in recent years Africa \r\nhas increasingly been a key actor in the prevention and \r\nresolution of conflicts. I must apologize today for the \r\nabsence at this General Assembly of the President of \r\nthe Republic of Benin, Mr. Thomas Boni Yayi, who \r\nleft a few hours ago. In his capacity as a mediator \r\nfor the Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS), he was summoned to finish mediating \r\nthe internal conflict in Burkina Faso and to help the \r\npeople of that country in their quest to resolve their \r\ninternal problems. The President is on his way, ever the \r\noptimistic.\r\nThat is one example of what we can do, but we also \r\ncontribute to the task force constituted by the brother \r\ncountries of Nigeria, the Niger, Cameroon and Chad \r\nto fight Boko Haram together in a resolute manner. \r\nEight hundred Beninese soldiers, many of them trained \r\nfor action and intervention as part of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, shall take their place beside \r\nto their sisters and brothers in arms.\r\nConflict prevention is very important. Let me \r\nhighlight an initiative that the United Nations has \r\nstrongly supported. We met in Cotonou from 26 to \r\n28 May at a symposium on education for peace and \r\ninterreligious dialogue. We have the opportunity as \r\n14/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\na people to be a nation of peaceful and constructive \r\ncoexistence for development among our traditional \r\nreligions and the religions of the Book. That symposium \r\nled to the adoption of a manifesto that proposes ways \r\nforward to create this harmony and determination \r\nto live together that are key elements in preventing \r\nfuture conflicts and threats. I should like to thank \r\nthe United Nations for its support and call on the \r\ninternational community to draw inspiration from and \r\nsubstantively assist us in following up on this reflection \r\non interreligious dialogue with its roots in African soil.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Benin was the \r\ndriving force behind the coordination of the offer to \r\nprovide the least developed countries with the services \r\nof the Secretary-General. in that regard, I thank the \r\nOrganization and especially the Secretary-General for \r\ntheir assistance. We have thus been able to improve the \r\nplight of the least developed countries. Here, too, it is \r\nvital that, in the historic adoption of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, our least developed countries \r\nreceived a certain number of very strong commitments \r\nin economic development, earmarked to their specific \r\ncases.\r\nIn terms of the way the United Nations is evolving, \r\nlet me just say that Benin is very attached to seeing \r\never-stronger cooperation with the African institutions. \r\nWhen the President of the Republic of Benin assumed \r\nthe presidency of the African Union in 2012, we saw in \r\nthe situation in Mali how perfect coordination between \r\nthe United Nations and the African Union, with the \r\nassistance of ECOWAS, yielded favourable results \r\nin terms of stabilization and appeasing an eminently \r\ndangerous situation.\r\nInstitutionalizing relations between the African \r\nUnion Peace and Security Council and the United \r\nNations Security Council is obviously a goal that we \r\nwant to see pursued effectively. In speaking of the \r\nSecurity Council, we clearly share the African position \r\nwhich seeks to remedy the historic injustice of Africa’s \r\nlack of representation among the permanent members \r\nof the Security Council, and sometimes on the Security \r\nCouncil in any guise.\r\nIf the Security Council wants to be effective, it \r\nis hard to leave more than 1 billion people, who will \r\nbecome 2 billion people in the space of a generation, \r\noutside the Council. It is hard to remain committed \r\nto privileges dating back to 1945. Those opposed to \r\nequitable representation of Member States within the \r\nSecurity Council need to use the fact that we have \r\nentered our seventy-first year to truly modernize the \r\nCouncil. It will make it more effective given the major \r\ncontemporary political problems before us.\r\nIn that respect I should like to say that we believe \r\nthat major progress has been made on a number \r\nof subjects on which we need to move forward on \r\nfurther. We welcome the call for the establishment of \r\nan independent Palestinian State, a fully-f ledged State \r\nMember, living in good relations with its neighbours, \r\nIsrael. We are convinced that this would create an \r\nimpetus to ease tensions in that part of the world so \r\nthat we could then declare the Middle East a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone the next day.\r\nBut we were also very encouraged by the \r\nnegotiations that ended on 14 July 2015 in Vienna with \r\nthe resolution of what could have been a very grave \r\nconflict, which saw the Islamic Republic of Iran and the \r\nfive permanent members of the Security Council plus \r\none reaching an agreement on the nuclear issue that \r\nmaintains the possibility of the peaceful use of nuclear \r\nenergy for the welfare and well-being of the people \r\nwhile at the same time avoiding the considerable risks \r\nthat were crystallizing.\r\nWe also noted with emotion during this session of \r\nthe General Assembly to see we are moving towards \r\na complete lifting of the United States embargo on \r\nCuba and the progress made. We want to commend \r\nboth President Raul Castro Ruz and President Barack \r\nObama for their spectacular courage in being able to \r\nwipe the slate clean and being able to build a future of \r\nhope for the two peoples. It is vital, and the whole world \r\nshould benefit from it.\r\nI should like to conclude by returning to \r\nthe question of good governance and combating \r\ncorruption. The post-2015 agenda is very demanding, \r\nand that is as it should be. With a country like Benin, \r\na least developed country, what we have to do in 15 \r\nyears is something that humankind has never done. \r\nThere will be more than 150 million new inhabitants \r\nin a few years in Africa, with all that means in terms \r\nof the balance of our ecosystems, social equilibrium, \r\nneeds for education, and for infrastructure in terms of \r\nurbanization. What lies ahead, no one has ever done. The \r\ngoals that we are proposing no one has ever proposed. \r\nThat is a considerable step forward, and the success of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals in many countries \r\nand in our own from — all the people — ensured \r\n15-29701 15/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nthat significant progress was made on all of them. \r\nIn Bangladesh they achieved all the goals. That is an \r\nextraordinary feat and is rather dizzying because it now \r\nfaces something even more demanding. We will need \r\nall the aid from the international community, but we \r\nourselves will need to draw on our own strengths and \r\nthe best possible governance.\r\nThe President of the Republic of Benin is coming \r\nto the end of his two constitutional mandates, in \r\ncompliance with the Constitution. He is ensuring that \r\nthe elections to take place six months’ time in Benin \r\nwill follow the example for all previous elections, just \r\nlike the last two at municipal legislative levels that have \r\njust taken place. The democratic changeovers that the \r\ncountry has seen over the past five years should once \r\nagain be marked with success and dignity.\r\nWe are but a small example, but an example of \r\ndemocracy and of governance that knows its limits and \r\nshortcomings but is getting better. We are an example \r\nof democracy for Africa, and we think that today that is \r\nthe primary ingredient of any successful development \r\npolicy given the challenges that lies ahead. We seek \r\nto be there in the spirit of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister in Charge of Economic Development, \r\nEvaluation of Public Policies and the Promotion of \r\nGood Governance of the Republic of Benin for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Lionel Zinsou, Prime Minister in Charge of \r\nEconomic Development, Evaluation of Public \r\nPolicies and the Promotion of Good Governance \r\nof the Republic of Benin, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Gilles Tonelli, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco.\r\nMr. Tonelli (Monaco) (spoke in French): The \r\nsuccessful outcome of the United Nations Summit \r\nto adopt the post-2015 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) coincided with the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Organization and reflected \r\nthe joint resolve to face up to, over the 15 years, the \r\nmany obstacles and global challenges that impede \r\nsustainable development for all. The Heads of State and \r\nGovernment adopted a historic agreement whose goals \r\naim at eradicating poverty and restoring dignity to each \r\nindividual so that all might enjoy their freedoms and \r\nrights.\r\nThe twenty-first century should meet the \r\nexpectations of peoples for higher social justice and \r\nfor shared prosperity and a healthy environment that \r\nis respectful of future generations, as was quite rightly \r\nunderlined by His Holiness Pope Francis in front of the \r\nGeneral Assembly (see A/70/PV.3). The proliferation of \r\nconflicts and crises and the millions of victims caught \r\nup in their destructive wake further strengthen our \r\ndetermination to pursue the transformation of current \r\nmodels, whose ambition is to match the challenges we \r\nare facing.\r\nThe continuing tragedy in Syria and the barbaric \r\nmeans used by extremist groups, which is being \r\npropagated in West Africa and the Middle East, \r\nfill us with horror. Such groups indiscriminately \r\ntarget religious minorities, civilians, women and \r\nchildren — the latter always being the most common \r\nvictims. In addition, the international community \r\ncannot remain indifferent in the face of the destruction \r\nof our common human heritage, such as the temples in \r\nPalmyra. They are a symbol of the Middle East as the \r\ncradle of a culture for thousands of years. We therefore \r\nstrongly support the Secretary-General’s “Rights Up \r\nFront” initiative and his endeavour to establish a plan \r\nof action on preventing violent extremism.\r\nIn that regard, I should like to remind members \r\nthat Monaco co-sponsored Security Council resolution \r\n2178 (2014), on foreign terrorist fighters and combating \r\nviolent extremism. The Principality of Monaco is \r\nalready implementing Security Council resolutions on \r\nfreezing assets and imposing economic sanctions on \r\npeople who might be connected to terrorist networks. \r\nFurthermore, Monaco is currently reinforcing its legal \r\nframework in the area of national security. We are \r\nalso actively participating in the fight against money \r\nlaundering for funds coming from illicit activities.\r\nWe are aware of the importance of cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations. \r\nMonaco therefore continues to support a peaceful \r\nsolution to the crisis in Ukraine. We did so over the \r\ncourse of the last three months of 2014, when we \r\nchaired the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe (OSCE) Forum for Security Co-operation, \r\n16/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nand we continue to do so today by supporting the work \r\nof the OSCE Observer Mission.\r\nThe past few months have seen f lows of migrants in \r\nEurope that have been unprecedented since the Second \r\nWorld War. The dire humanitarian consequences \r\nrequire a coordinated multilateral approach. The \r\nEuropean Union plan in that regard provides a timely \r\nresponse. The principle of the responsibility to protect \r\nwas endorsed by His Serene Highness Prince Albert \r\n10 years ago from this high rostrum; it must be the basis \r\nfor our collective action in the face of genocide, ethnic \r\ncleansing and other crimes against humanity.\r\nThe primary responsibility bestowed by the charter \r\nof the Security Council to maintain international peace \r\nand security brings me to commend the courageous \r\ninitiative taken by France and Mexico in calling for the \r\nvoluntary and collective suspension of the right of veto \r\nby its five permanent members when dealing with mass \r\natrocities. I take this opportunity today to announce \r\nMonaco’s official support for that initiative, as well as \r\nthe one presented by the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency group to develop a code of conduct that \r\nwould apply to all Member States.\r\nLet me also express our gratitude to those who \r\npromote such specific and ethical measures to reinforce \r\nthe effectiveness of the Security Council and make \r\nits decisions more convincing in the face of public \r\nopinion. All of the efforts made to promote better \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council merit support. \r\nMy Government welcomes the recent developments in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiation process.\r\nIn one month’s time we will celebrate the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace and \r\nsecurity, when the results of the global study on its \r\nimplementation will be released. Unfortunately, we are \r\ntoo sadly familiar with the devastating consequences \r\nof conflicts for women, who are often the first victims \r\nwhen they are, however, not responsible for such \r\nconflicts. Along with children, they also represent the \r\nmajority of refugees and displaced persons. Convinced \r\nof the importance of the full and active participation \r\nof women on an equal footing in preventing conflicts \r\nand peacefully resolving them, as well as in \r\npeacebuilding and peacekeeping, we therefore call for \r\nthe implementation of specific measures.\r\nThe issues to be tackled by the first humanitarian \r\nsummit proposed by the Secretary-General are of the \r\nutmost importance, and all the more given that, in \r\naddition to the human tragedy I have just mentioned, \r\nwe must also address the issues of the victims of \r\nclimate change, natural disasters and a health crisis. \r\nIn that regard, the international community will have \r\nto define a new humanitarian deployment framework \r\nthat can respond to the growing and complex needs, can \r\nsupport financing and can complement operations by \r\nproviding planning and long-term development.\r\nRegional consultations have already highlighted \r\nthe concerns of various stakeholders. They will allow \r\nfor adequate responses to be found not only that \r\nmeet the complexity of the humanitarian crises but \r\nalso the specificity of each of the crises. Monaco has \r\nparticipated actively in that preparatory work, in line \r\nwith our commitment in the context of our international \r\ncooperation policy and as part of the major mobilization \r\nby our non-governmental organizations and the \r\nMonegasque Red Cross.\r\nThe magnitude of the Ebola virus epidemic served \r\nonce again to demonstrate the absolute need to build \r\neffective sustainable health systems that can face up \r\nto extraordinary situations. In that regard, Monaco has \r\nalready expressed its support for the reform that has \r\nbeen begun by the World Health Organization.\r\nThe Addis Ababa Action Agenda was developed to \r\nfacilitate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, with its 17 Goals and 169 \r\ntargets. The aim is to find an effective way to transform \r\nour lifestyles. The technology facilitation mechanism \r\nlaunched during that summit reflects a spirit of \r\ncollaboration among all development stakeholders \r\nfor the benefit of developing countries. It also bears \r\nwitness to the will of the international community to \r\nbuild capacity in a specific manner.\r\nHowever, those efforts will not be successful without \r\nan ambitious and legally binding universal agreement \r\nthat allows us to fight climate change effectively and \r\nto move towards low-carbon and resilient societies and \r\neconomies. The Principality of Monaco is convinced \r\nthat the twenty-first Conference of Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Chage, \r\nto be held in Paris, will be part of that trend and will \r\nhelp us to achieve a global crimate agreement. Such \r\nan agreement is a sine qua non condition for the full \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\n15-29701 17/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nThat is why Prince Albert has committed the \r\nPrincipality to reducing its greenhouse-gas emissions \r\nby 50 per cent by 2030, as compared with 1990 levels. He \r\nhas also renewed his commitment to carbon neutrality \r\nby 2050. In setting those objectives, the Principality \r\ndemonstrates its willingness to take a full part in the \r\ncollective effort needed to face one of humankind’s \r\nbiggest challenges. Despite its low emissions footprint, \r\nMonaco will continue to promote innovative means \r\nof transportation and consumption, as well as urban \r\nplanning that is as green as possible.\r\nWe cannot talk about the climate without talking \r\nabout the issue of the oceans, which play a central role \r\nin regulating the world’s climate. That is the reason \r\nthat has led the Principality of Monacto to support \r\nthe 2015 ocean and climate platform of UNESCO’s \r\nIntergovernmental Oceanographic Commission. \r\nMonaco is pleased to see that this is an integral part \r\nof the sustainable development programme, which \r\nstrengthens the implementation of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea — a veritabale \r\nconstitution of the oceans. That is the sense behind \r\nthe personal commitment of Prince Albert and also of \r\nhis leadership of his Government’s actions in favour \r\nof healthy and productive oceans and seas. To ensure \r\nthe implementation of this agenda, Monaco proposes \r\nto convene conferences every three years from 2017 \r\nonwards.\r\nFor small island developing States the ocean is not \r\njust a source of economic and social benefit, it is also an \r\nintegral part of their identity. For that reason, Monaco \r\nhas increased its cooperation for climate change \r\nadaptation and for the preservation of biodiversity \r\nas well as for access to water, the development of \r\nsustainable tourism and for capacity-building.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to take this opportunity \r\nto remind the Assembly that for several years now \r\nMonaco has proposed increasing the protection of \r\nmarine mammals from the growing threat caused \r\nby human beings. We hope that this proposal will be \r\nincluded in the omnibus draft resolution on oceans at \r\nthis current session.\r\nIn 70 years, the United Nations has worked to \r\nhonour the goals bestowed on it by the Charter. It has \r\nrepeatedly adapted itself to emerging challenges that \r\nhave transformed the world since its creation. The \r\npolitical will that prevailed during the United Nations \r\nSummit to adopt the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nhas served to encourage us to further strengthen the \r\nOrganization by giving it the means to pursue its noble \r\nmandate. We have thus reaffirmed the legitimacy of \r\nthe values and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations in today’s world. The Principality of Monaco \r\nremains more than ever convinced that this is necessary, \r\nand it will continue to make its modest but resolute \r\ncontribution to building a better world while respecting \r\nour differences.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Elmar Maharram oglu Mammadyarov, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nMr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I \r\nshould like to congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventieth session and to wish him every success \r\nin fulfilling that highly responsible duty. We are also \r\ngrateful to Mr. Sam Kutesa for all his hard work in \r\npresiding over the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.\r\nOver the past 70 years, the United Nations has \r\ndecisively established itself as a universal Organization \r\nworking for the noble cause of maintaining international \r\npeace and security, developing friendly relations among \r\nStates and achieving international cooperation. The \r\nability of the United Nations to respond to a rapidly \r\nchanging international environment by constant \r\nadaptation is remarkable. It gives us confidence to \r\nbelieve that the Organization will succeed in addressing \r\nthe challenges it faces.\r\nAzerbaijan condemns terrorism, violent extremism \r\nand separatism in all their forms and manifestations. \r\nIn situations of armed conflict or political crisis \r\ninvolving inter-State relations, no solution can be \r\nreached that is inconsistent with international law and \r\nlegal order — particularly where fundamental norms \r\nare concerned, such as the obligation to respect the \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and the inviolability of \r\nthe internationally recognized borders of States.\r\nWith a view to contemporary developments, I have \r\nto express our deepest concern over the unfolding \r\nrefugee crises fuelled by the armed conflicts in the \r\nMiddle East and Africa. We are equally alarmed by \r\nincreasing cases of religious intolerance, in particular \r\nIslamophobia, and attempts to associate religions with \r\nterrorism.\r\n18/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nGuided by the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, Azerbaijan is making concrete \r\ncontributions to the activities of the United Nations. For \r\nmore than 15 years, my country has been participating \r\nin United Nations-mandated peacekeeping operations \r\nconducted under the command of regional organizations \r\nor individual Member States — in Kosovo, Iraq and \r\nAfghanistan. We look forward to further supporting \r\nthe United Nations peacekeeping activities, including \r\nby providing training facilities in Azerbaijan.\r\nThe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) were \r\nof key importance in promoting development worldwide. \r\nIn that regard, we are confident that the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) will be an effective tool in \r\nglobal efforts to achieve peace, prosperity and growth.\r\nOver the past years, Azerbaijan has achieved \r\nimpressive results on many MDG targets, especially \r\non eradicating extreme poverty and hunger, ensuring \r\nuniversal primary education and promoting gender \r\nequality. Currently, Azerbaijan is adapting its national \r\nsustainable development strategy to take into account \r\nthe SDG targets aimed at developing a more sustainable, \r\ninclusive and diversified economy. In recognition of \r\nAzerbaijan’s outstanding commitment, determination \r\nand continuous efforts towards the implementation of \r\nthe MDGs, my country received the 2015 South-South \r\nAward.\r\nDespite the global economic and financial crises \r\nencountered by many countries of the region, in the \r\nfirst half of 2015 Azerbaijan registered economic \r\ngrowth of 5.7 per cent, while the growth in the non-oil \r\nsector was 9.2 per cent. My country has managed to \r\nbecome one of the crucial players of the global market \r\nin energy infrastructure projects, such as the Baku-\r\nTbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline, through the construction \r\nof trans-Anatolian and trans-Adriatic natural gas \r\npipelines and the Southern Gas corridor, which will \r\nconnect the energy pipeline networks of Azerbaijan, \r\nGeorgia, Turkey, Greece, Albania and Italy.\r\nAzerbaijan has also initiated strategic transport \r\ninfrastructure networks, such as the Baku-Tbilisi-Kars \r\nrailroad project, which will connect the railway systems \r\nof Azerbaijan, Georgia and Turkey, and the new Baku \r\ninternational sea trade port, allowing short and efficient \r\nconnection between East and West, reviving the ancient \r\nSilk Road.\r\nAzerbaijan considers information and communication \r\ntechnologies as a driving force of development and \r\nhas initiated the Trans-Eurasian Information Super-\r\nHighway within the United Nations, which is \r\ndesigned to provide affordable and reliable broadband \r\nconnectivity to landlocked countries of Eurasia, \r\nincluding Afghanistan and Central Asian States.\r\nOn the human dimension, Azerbaijan continues to \r\npromote tolerance, multiculturalism and understanding \r\namong peoples. We are proud that the first European \r\nGames in the history of the European continent were \r\nheld this year in Baku, with the participation of more \r\nthan 6,000 athletes from 50 countries. In 2017, my \r\ncountry will host the Islamic Solidarity Games. We \r\nare also planning to hold the seventh Global Forum of \r\nthe United Nations Alliance of Civilizations in Baku \r\nin 2016.\r\nYesterday the President of Armenia delivered a \r\nstatement at the general debate (see A/70/PV.17) that \r\nwas full of the usual set of falsifications, distortions \r\nand misinterpretations, and in which he attempted \r\nonce again to lecture others about principles and \r\nvalues, which in reality his Government disregards \r\nand opposes. The international community still recalls \r\nbrutal massacres by invading Armenian troops on \r\nAzerbaijani civilians, including children, women and \r\nthe elderly, as well as the establishment of the military \r\ndictatorship in Armenia after murdering the entire \r\npolitical elite of the country and killing a number of \r\npeaceful demonstrators protesting rigged presidential \r\nelections.\r\nIt is well known that Armenia unleashed the war \r\nand used force against my country and occupied almost \r\none fifth of the territory of Azerbaijan, including \r\nthe Nagorno-Karabakh region and seven adjacent \r\ndistricts, carried out ethnic cleansing of the seized \r\nareas by expelling about 1 million Azerbaijanis from \r\ntheir homes and committed war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity during the conflict. The international \r\ncommunity has consistently deplored in the strongest \r\nterms the use of force by Armenia against Azerbaijan \r\nand the resulting occupation of its territories.\r\nIn 1993 the Security Council adopted resolutions \r\n822 (1993), 853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993), \r\ncondemning the occupation of the territory \r\nof Azerbaijan and reaffirming respect for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan \r\nand the inviolability of its internationally recognized \r\nborders. In those resolutions the Security Council also \r\nconfirmed that the Nagorno-Karabakh region is part of \r\n15-29701 19/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nAzerbaijan and demanded an immediate, complete and \r\nunconditional withdrawal of the occupying forces from \r\nall the occupied territories of my country.\r\nOther international organizations have adopted \r\na similar position and resolutions. In its landmark \r\njudgement in the case Chiragov and Others v. Armenia, \r\nthe European Court of Human Rights held Armenia \r\nfully responsible for the occupation of the territories of \r\nAzerbaijan and in violation of the rights of Azerbaijani \r\ninternally displaced persons. In total disregard for \r\nthat judgement and the norms and principles of \r\ninternational law, Armenia continues its efforts aimed \r\nat further consolidating the status quo of the occupation \r\nby altering the physical, demographic and cultural \r\ncharacteristics of the occupied territories and denying \r\nthe right of hundreds of thousands of Azerbaijani \r\nforcibly displaced persons to return to their homes and \r\naccess to their properties.\r\nOn 26 September this year, the President of \r\nArmenia made an even more remarkable statement, \r\nreferring to the occupied Nagorno-Karabakh region of \r\nAzerbaijan as a part of Armenia. We categorically reject \r\nthat fallacious and bellicose statement, which testifies \r\nto Armenia’s apparent disregard of its obligations under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international law, \r\nand represents yet another admission at the highest \r\nlevel of the aggression perpetrated by the Republic \r\nof Armenia against the Republic of Azerbaijan and \r\ndemonstrates how the leadership of Armenia is far \r\nfrom engaging in a constructive search for peace. In \r\nthat statement, the Armenian President even boasted \r\nthat his country was one of the most militarized areas \r\nof the world.\r\nAgainst that background, Armenia’s speculations \r\non confidence-building measures are curious, to \r\nsay the least. In fact, the real reasons for the lack of \r\nconfidence are Armenia’s overt territorial claims to \r\nneighbouring countries, aggression against Azerbaijan, \r\noccupation and ethnic cleansing of its territories, denial \r\nof its responsibility for atrocious crimes committed in \r\nthe course of the conflict, opposition to direct contacts \r\nbetween the Azerbaijani and Armenian communities of \r\nthe Nagorno-Karabakh region of Azerbaijan, and the \r\nreluctance even to cooperate seriously on the issue of \r\nmissing persons.\r\nIn reality, for effective confidence-building, it is \r\ncrucial first and foremost to implement without further \r\ndelay the plan of withdrawal of the armed forces of \r\nArmenia from the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. \r\nAs for the ideas of elaborating a mechanism for \r\ninvestigating incidents along the line of contact, we \r\nshould note that the major cause of those incidents is \r\nthe continuing unlawful presence of the Armenian \r\ntroops in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan. Such an \r\ninvestigation mechanism must be an integral component \r\nof the above-mentioned withdrawal. Otherwise, it will \r\nserve only for consolidating the status quo, which \r\neven the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe Minsk Group co-Chair countries have \r\nrepeatedly stated to be unacceptable and unsustainable.\r\nThe Nagorno-Karabakh region has always been, \r\nand will remain, an inalienable part of Azerbaijan. We \r\nwill never acquiesce to the seizure of our territories. \r\nThe conflict can be resolved only on the basis of the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan \r\nwithin its internationally recognized borders.\r\nThe military occupation of the territory of my \r\ncountry does not represent a solution, and will never \r\nproduce a political outcome desired by Armenia. The \r\nsooner Armenia reconciles with this reality, the earlier \r\nthe conflict will be resolved and the countries and \r\npeoples in the region, including Armenia, of course, \r\nwill benefit from the prospects of cooperation and \r\neconomic development.\r\nAzerbaijan is the most interested party in the \r\nearliest negotiated settlement of the conflict. However, \r\nif the negotiations fail to bring, as an outcome, the \r\ncomplete and unconditional withdrawal of Armenian \r\ntroops, Azerbaijan will be compelled to use its inherent \r\nright of self-defence, guaranteed under Article 51 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, to ensure the restoration \r\nof its sovereignty and territorial integrity within the \r\ninternationally recognized borders.\r\nAzerbaijan highly appreciates the principled stance \r\nof the States Members of the United Nations that has \r\nbeen repeatedly expressed on issues that are of the \r\nutmost importance for my country and pertaining to its \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We count on the \r\ncontinued resolve of the international community in \r\ndefending the purposes and principles of the Charter, \r\nas well as its strong solidarity with the just position of \r\nAzerbaijan.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. José Manuel García Margallo, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of Spain.\r\n20/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nMr. García Margallo (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThere is a famous etching by Goya called “The Dream of \r\nReason Produces Monsters”. Goya taught us that when \r\nreason deserts us, when it literally falls asleep, it leaves \r\nspace free for the worst demons of our nature to take \r\nhold. Seventy years ago humankind awoke not from a \r\ndream, but from a nightmare. The unbridled exercise \r\nof power without the check of law or the calmness of \r\nreason produced the monsters of the Second World War \r\nand of the Shoah.\r\nLaw is the reason of States. I am referring to \r\nthe law expressed through the formal foundations \r\nof a democratic, lawful State by the legitimate \r\nrepresentatives of national sovereignty. When those \r\nfoundations are overwhelmed, when the reason of law \r\nis f louted, the monsters of Goya are always lying in \r\nwait. Seventy years ago, humankind, represented by the \r\nUnited Nations at San Francisco, learned its lesson. The \r\nfounders of the United Nations reached the conclusion \r\nthat, just as States have constitutions that govern the \r\nnorms of coexistence among their citizens, it was \r\nnecessary for the international community to acquire \r\nits own supreme law, its own Magna Carta.\r\nThe San Francisco Charter is the constitution \r\nof humankind. Its Preamble and its purposes and \r\nprinciples underpin the edifice that is home to us all. \r\nAmong them, respect for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of States is essential to ensure the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. If those pillars \r\nare weakened, neglected or substituted by a will that \r\nconsiders itself above the law, that edifice literally will \r\ncrumble on top of us and leave us out in the cold.\r\n“A strong United Nations, a better world” is the \r\nmotto with which we are commemorating the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations. There are those who \r\nwill deny that. For them the United Nations is a weak \r\nOrganization, one unable to respond to the challenges \r\nand threats of our time. I do not think that is true. It is \r\nclear that there are reasons for hope.\r\nThe nuclear agreement reached with Iran and the \r\nrestoration of diplomatic relations between the United \r\nStates and Cuba and the prospect of a peace agreement \r\nin Colombia soon show that situations that have festered \r\nfor far too long can be resolved. Spain welcomes that. \r\nNow we need to take a further step forward so that \r\nboth Iran and Cuba, proud countries with very defined \r\nidentities and highly qualified populations, can become \r\ncatalysts for change and contribute to stability and \r\nprogress in their respective regions.\r\nIf it is possible to reach agreement in situations \r\nthat many considered were unresolvable, as Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom \r\nof Spain, it would be remiss of me not to mention the \r\ndispute over Gibraltar, the last colony on European \r\nterritory. We want to re-initiate with the United \r\nKingdom bilateral dialogue on the decolonization of \r\nGibraltar based on the parameters established by the \r\nUnited Nations and the Brussels Declaration of 1984.\r\nOn a different tack, my country hopes that the \r\nUnited Kingdom will respond to the Spanish proposal \r\nof establishing a new local cooperation mechanism \r\nin the interests of social well-being and the economic \r\ndevelopment of the region. That would include \r\nparticipation by the local competent Gibraltarian \r\nauthorities and the competent local and regional \r\nSpanish authorities.\r\nLight predominates over the darkness in other \r\nareas too. I am thinking of the challenge of climate \r\nchange. It is true that time is running out, but also that \r\nthere are well-founded hopes that at the Paris summit \r\nin December we will achieve results that will allow us \r\nto stop the process of the deterioration of our common \r\nhome and decisively turn things around. We therefore \r\nneed a sustainable growth model, one that is equitable \r\nand leaves no one behind.\r\nOnce again, hopes have begun to turn into reality \r\nthanks to the recent adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1). His Majesty \r\nthe King, who was present at the Summit where the \r\nAgenda was adoped, reiterated the commitment of \r\nour country to its implementation — a commitment \r\nalready translated into acts with the establishment of a \r\nSustainable Development Goals fund, which is initially \r\nbeing financed by Spain but is open to all other States \r\nand to the private sector.\r\nI consider myself to be among those who believe \r\nthat the twenty-first century will be the century of \r\nthe woman, but that will only be so if we all play our \r\npart. For as the President of Chile, Michelle Bachelet \r\nJeria, has said, equality will not happen by itself. That \r\nis why Spain has for some time been encouraging the \r\nparticipation and leadership of women in all dimensions \r\nof collective life. To that end, our strategic plan for equal \r\nopportunities 2014-2016 has been allocated €3.1 billion.\r\n15-29701 21/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nWe will be bringing our national commitment to \r\nequality to our presidency of the Security Council. \r\nDuring our presidency, on 13 October, we will hold a \r\nhigh-level open debate on Security Council resolution \r\n1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, to be \r\npresided over by the President of the Government of \r\nSpain. I invite everyone to take part at the highest level, \r\nbecause the occasion merits it.\r\nTerrorism is the main threat to the model of the just, \r\nprosperous, equitable and open society that we seek to \r\nbuild for the peace and security of the international \r\ncommunity. Spain has been hit hard by both domestic \r\nand international terrorism. Back in 1960, 55 years ago, \r\nas a result of the explosion of a bomb placed in a railway \r\nstation by the Euskadi Ta Askatasuna terrorist group, \r\na 22-month-old child, Begoña Urroz, died. Since then \r\n850 human beings — men, women and children — have \r\nlost their lives as a result of the terrorist madness. All \r\nterrorism is born from hatred and disdain for life and \r\nis a crime against humanity. That is the basis that we \r\nwork on.\r\nBut it is also true that evil manifests itself in \r\ndifferent forms depending on the circumstances and \r\nthe historical times. In our lifetime jihadist terrorism \r\nis at its most lethal insidious form. Spain too suffered \r\nat its hands. On 11 March 2004, 190 people of various \r\nnationalities, the majority workers, were killed, and \r\nmore than a 1,800 people were injured.\r\nIn the case of Daesh we are up against a terrorist \r\nmovement that has sought to control a territorial base \r\nfrom which it seeks to launch attacks and to destroy \r\nour model of civilization. Because all of us are targets, \r\nwe must all form a common front against Daesh. There \r\ncan be no negotiation with terrorists; they must be \r\ndefeated — only lawfully, but with all of the law. That \r\nis why Spain did not hesitate to join, right from the \r\nbeginning, the international coalition fighting against \r\nDaesh in Iraq at the side of the Government and the \r\npeople of Iraq.\r\nBut military intervention is not enough. It is also \r\nnecessary to combat radicalization, which leads so \r\nmany youngsters to fill their ranks. Spain placed at the \r\ndisposal of this common struggle its own experience \r\nin multilateral initiatives such as the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations, the Vienna King Abdullah International \r\nCentre for Interreligious and Intercultural Dialogue \r\nand the Union for the Mediterranean.\r\nFrom its own experience we know that saving \r\nand keeping alive the memory of the victims is vital \r\nto prevent a repetition of such horrors. On too many \r\noccasions we have seen the victims presented as being \r\nthe guilty, as though bringing their sacrifice upon \r\nthemselves. If I may, another personal experience I \r\nshould like to recall is that until 1997, the year that saw \r\nthe assassination of Miguel Ángel Blanco, we had to \r\nbury our dead virtually in secret. In order for that not \r\nto be repeated, and so that the voice of the victims can \r\nreach all corners of the planet, on 21 October we will \r\nopen up the Security Council for the sake of dignity, \r\nmemory and justice.\r\nTo the same end, joining forces to combat \r\nradicalization and extremism, the Madrid Club has \r\ninvited about 100 former Heads of State or Government \r\non 27 and 28 October. Their experience will be \r\nincredibly useful to us.\r\nNow let me refer to impunity. Spain and Romania \r\nhave decided to propose the establishment of an \r\ninternational criminal court against terrorism. We think \r\nit is necessary for the United Nations to consider this \r\nproposal in all its scope. This would be an international \r\njurisdictional mechanism to combat the crimes of \r\ninternational terrorism using the tools of international \r\nlaw. Such a court would complement the action of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and would intervene \r\nwhen a State is not in a position to carry out trials itself.\r\nConflicts in regions such as the Middle East and \r\nin parts of Africa are the origin of the most serious \r\nmigratory crisis Europe has seen since the Second \r\nWorld War. The images of this immense tragedy \r\nrightly move our hearts, but it is our reason that can \r\nprovide solutions. Of course, what is most urgent is \r\nthe humanitarian response — saving lives, providing \r\nshelter, healing and feeding. But it is important also to \r\ndraw up a comprehensive asylum and integration policy \r\nthat sets out the concepts of asylum and economic \r\nmigration and that takes into account the rights and \r\ndignity of people who risk their lives to find a better \r\nfuture for themselves and their children. I think that the \r\ntime has come to begin thinking about a global covenant \r\nunder United Nations auspices in which countries of \r\norigin, countries of transit and host countries would all \r\nparticipate. Migration is a global challenge that we can \r\nsolve only by working together.\r\nI said earlier that the origin of the current migratory \r\ncrisis were the festering conflicts, conflicts often \r\n22/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nexacerbated by lack of response from the international \r\ncommunity and as a result of the brutality of the parties. \r\nThe paradigmatic case is that of Syria — four and a \r\nhalf years of conflict; 250,000 lives lost; 12 million \r\npeople in desperate need of humanitarian assistance; \r\n7.6 million internally displaced persons; 4 million \r\nrefugees in neighbouring countries — the statistics \r\nhave been calling out to us for too long.\r\nA solution to the conflict is urgent. We must \r\nwork on two fronts: first, by providing an immediate \r\nhumanitarian response to assuage the suffering of the \r\nSyrian people, and, secondly, supporting the inclusive \r\npolitical process propposed by the Special Envoy of the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Staffan de Mistura.\r\nThere is similar urgency with regard to the \r\nconflict in Libya. We support the work of the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, my compatriot \r\nBernardino León, and we continue with impatience to \r\nseek an agreement for the formation of a Government of \r\nnational accord. We call for courage and for all parties \r\nto come together to overcome the fracture of a country \r\ndivided in two, and where on the horizon we can already \r\nsee the black f lag of Daesh just a few kilometres from \r\nour coast. Let me say that the partition of Libya would \r\nbe the worst possible solution.\r\nOf course, in the Middle East we continue to be \r\ncommitted to an agreement between Israelis and \r\nPalestinians that goes via the two-State solution with \r\nmutually agreed borders. We must revitalize the peace \r\nprocess. Spain will always be willing to support the \r\nparties to return to the path of direct negotiations.\r\nIn Africa the situation in Mali, the Central African \r\nRepublic and elsewhere troubles us greatly. But it is not \r\nall darkness in that continent; there are bright spots. The \r\nresponse to the Ebola epidemic and the development \r\nand rebuilding plans presented by the countries affected \r\nby Ebola fill us with hope. Spain continues to be very \r\noptimistic when it comes to Africa’s future.\r\nIn Europe the main shadow, but with certain bright \r\nspots, continues to be the crisis in Ukraine, where it \r\nis vital to implement the Minsk agreements and to \r\ncontinue building a climate of trust so as to put an end \r\nto a conflict of a different time. We call on the parties \r\nto seek that path.\r\nFinally, I am convinced that today the United \r\nNations is stronger in a world that, while it is still far \r\nfrom perfect, is better than that world of 70 years ago. \r\nTo keep moving forward towards perfection it is crucial \r\nto respect the values and the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter, including territorial integrity. Violation \r\nthereof, as history has taught us, is one of the preferred \r\ninstruments of the monsters of Goya to put us to sleep. \r\nTo avoid this it is necessary for the reason of law and \r\nthat the law of reason should remain ever alert. Among \r\nthe foundations are always dialogue, reconciliation and \r\ncohabitation. Without them we will be left out in the \r\ncold.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Samuel Rangba, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, African Integration and \r\nFrancophonie of the Central African Republic.\r\nMr. Rangba (Central African Republic) (spoke \r\nin French): The Head of State of the Transition, Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Catherine Samba Panza, was to have \r\nspoken to here at the General Assembly personally \r\nin order to thank the United Nations for its extremely \r\nvaluable support to the process of transition in the \r\nCentral African Republic. Alas, the resurgence of \r\nviolence since 25 September in the capital, Bangui, \r\nhas meant that she has had to return home earlier than \r\nintended. She has therefore asked me to give her speech \r\nas follows.\r\nIt is an honour and great pleasure for me to share \r\nwith the General Assembly the vision that my country \r\nhas on the major issues facing the world and to report \r\non developments in the situation in the Central African \r\nRepublic. The serious situation obtaining today in my \r\ncountry means that I must spare addressing international \r\nissues in order to call the attention of world leaders to \r\nthe new tragedy affecting the people of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic.\r\nI should like first of all sincerely to congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on being elected \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. He may rest assured of the full support of the \r\ndelegation of my country for the success of this session, \r\nwhich also marks the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI am also grateful to His Excellency Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa, his predecessor, who by his leadership and \r\nexample conducted the work of the sixty-ninth session \r\nand the preparatory work for the current session. \r\nMy gratitude also goes to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon. I should like to encourage him in his constant \r\ncommitment to peace, security and development in the \r\n15-29701 23/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nworld and congratulate him particularly on his personal \r\ninvolvement in endeavours to resolve the crisis in the \r\nCentral African Republic.\r\nA year ago, the Head of State of Transition \r\noutlined before the Assembly (see A/69/PV.15) the \r\ntragic situation in my country while appealing to the \r\ninternational community to mobilize and come to the \r\nhelp of the Central African Republic, beset by the \r\nindiscrimiate and savage violence by non-regulated \r\narmed groups. Given the cruelty of the atrocities and \r\nheinous crimes hitherto unknown in the history of \r\nmy country, the United Nations did not hesitate. The \r\ninternational community unanimously committed to \r\nsupport the Transitional Government, which had just \r\nbeen established. That commitment was reflected \r\nin the adoption of several resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil, one being resolution 2149 (2014), authorized \r\nthe deployment of the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African \r\nRepublic (MINUSCA).\r\nSupported by that commitment from the \r\ninternational community, the Head of State of Transition \r\nworked to the utmost to establish dialogue among the \r\nvarious protagonists in order together to find the way \r\nto social cohesion and stabilization for the country. It \r\nwas a question of ensuring a peaceful climate, one of \r\nconfidence, so that we could live together.\r\nThe crisis was far-reaching and complex. It required \r\na vigorous and global response, which the Transitional \r\nGovernment alone was not able to provide. In order \r\nto break the deadlock, the Transitional Government, \r\nwith the support of the international community, \r\ndrew up a road map with the following priorities: \r\nthe re-establishment of security and the building of \r\npeace; humanitarian assistance; the re-establishment \r\nof State authority throughout the national territory; the \r\nrecovery of the economy and the improvement of the \r\nmanagement of public finances; and the organization of \r\nfree, transparent and democratic elections for a return \r\nto constitutional order. Considerable progress has been \r\nmade in 18 months of transition.\r\nPolitically, after the signing of the agreement on \r\nthe cessation of hostilities in Brazzaville on 23 July \r\n2014, grassroots consultations organized throughout \r\nthe entire country made it possible to hold a national \r\nforum from 4 to 11 May, which brought together all \r\nforces in the nation, including the armed groups. That \r\nled to the adoption of significant recommendations \r\nand the signing of commitments by the armed groups \r\nto renounce violence. The electoral process is taking \r\nplace normally and the Government has undertaken \r\nto organize elections in accordance with the timetable \r\nestablished by the national elections authority, \r\nestablishing a deadline for the end of December this \r\nyear. That process is an irreversible one. The people of \r\nthe Central African Republic are determined to go to \r\nthe ballot box to choose their leaders democratically.\r\nIn 2011, while the country was at peace, the \r\nnumber of registered voters stood at 1,6 million. Today, \r\ndespite the crisis, the number is 1.59 million registered \r\nvoters. That shows the desire of the people to return to \r\nconstitutional order.\r\nAs far as security matters go, since the deployment of \r\nMINUSCA, on 15 September 2014, until the most recent \r\nsad events the situation was becoming progressively \r\nmore normal throughout the entire country. Bangui \r\nbegan to find once again its charming way of life \r\nwith the resumption of economic and social activities. \r\nWhile awaiting for the disarmament, demobilization \r\nand reintegration (DDR) process to begin, a pre-DDR \r\nprogramme was launched via the cantonment of former \r\narmed groups, who were employed in community work.\r\nOn the humanitarian front, the situation has \r\nonce again become alarming since the terrible date \r\nof 25 September. The number of internally displaced \r\npersons had been considerably reduced, but now we \r\nsee a horrendous spike, which means that there are \r\nnow more than 30,000 internally displaced people in \r\nBangui. Nevertheless, the number of refugees has \r\ndecreased from 1 million in 2014 to about 460,000 \r\nsince the voluntary return policy. The international \r\ncommunity has lent very strong support to the Central \r\nAfrican Republic in order to help its people go back \r\nhome.\r\nIn economic terms, the growth rate, which had \r\ndropped by 37 per cent at the height of the crisis in 2013, \r\ngrew by 1.3 per cent in 2014. The forecast for 2015 is of \r\nthe order of 5.5 per cent. That progress is attributable \r\nto the support of the international community, which \r\ncreated the necessary conditions to mobilize domestic \r\nresources, as well as the contributions from bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners.\r\nAfter a year of untiring efforts by the Transitional \r\nGovernment and the international community, we were \r\nable to state happily a week ago that the bad times were \r\nover and the Central African Republic was gradually \r\n24/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nrecovering from its travails and taking its place among \r\nthe community of nations.\r\nAlas, just as we came to tell the United Nations of \r\nthose encouraging results of the Transition, which is \r\nmoving to its end with the organization of elections at \r\nthe end of this year, the enemies of peace once again \r\ndealt a harsh blow to the process on 25 September by \r\nsavage violence, killings and terrible crimes leading to \r\nthe loss of many human lives and destruction as well as \r\nthe massive displacement of people.\r\nThat situation clearly shows that peace and \r\nreconciliation are still tenuous and require strong \r\nsupported action in order that my country will not \r\nonce again be drawn into a vicious cycle of violence, \r\nchallenging the progress made so arduously during \r\nthe Transition thanks to the determination of the \r\nGovernment and the people and the constant support of \r\nthe international community. We ask the international \r\ncommunity, an in particular the United Nations, to \r\nmake it possible for there to be a stronger presence in \r\nthe Central African Republic, stronger action to help \r\nto staunch destruction and widespread crime. For \r\n18 months the legitimate aspiration of the people for \r\nstability and development has remained dependent on \r\nthe security situation, which is still very uncertain as \r\nproven by the current outbreaks of violence in Bangui.\r\nI am aware that the outbreaks of crisis have \r\nmultiplied in the world today and that the Organization \r\nis facing many challenges on all fronts and resources are \r\ndiminishing ever more. But remember the thousands of \r\nchildren, women, old people and sick people and other \r\nvulnerable groups so hatefully killed in such a cowardly \r\nway, raped, humiliated or required to leave their homes \r\nto find refuge in unhealthy places under rain without \r\nshelter, just because a handful of individuals decided to \r\nput into practice their nefarious plans to destabilize an \r\nentire country to assuage their hunger for power.\r\nThat then is why I call upon the Security Council to \r\nreinforce MINUSCA’s mandate to better combat these \r\nenemies of peace and give hope once again to the sorely \r\ntried people of my country. That is why I demand that the \r\nSecurity Council consider lifting the sanctions regime, \r\nparticularly regarding the training and equipment of \r\nour defence and security forces within the framework \r\nof bilateral cooperation with friendly countries ready to \r\nhelp the Central African Republic.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, speeding up the reform \r\nof the security sector, the pre-DDR and DDR efforts \r\nare the immediate absolute priorities as we move \r\ntowards rebuilding a national multi-ethnic army that \r\nis representative of all regions of the country and able \r\nto lend its support to the actions of the international \r\nforces.\r\nI also remain deeply disturbed by the matter \r\nof impunity, which continues despite the sanctions \r\npursuant to Security Council resolutions 2127 (2013) \r\nand 2134 (2014), pertaining to certain Central African \r\ncitizens at the root of the crisis today. The failure to \r\nimplement the provisions of those resolutions is one \r\nof the causes of the lasting violence of armed groups \r\nand the violence in our country. That is why the \r\nGovernment has established a special criminal court in \r\norder to try all those responsible for mass atrocities and \r\nthe destruction seen in the country today.\r\nThis is the right forum to pay tribute to MINUSCA \r\nand to all those who have made their contribution in \r\norder to give new hope to the people of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, inter alia, the member countries of \r\nthe Security Council, the African Union, the European \r\nUnion, the Economic Community of Central African \r\nStates, the Central African Monetary and Economic \r\nCommunity, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, \r\nthe International Conference on the Great Lakes \r\nRegion, France, the United States of America and the \r\nKingdom of Morocco.\r\nThis seventieth session of the General Assembly \r\nis being held against a backdrop of generalized threats \r\naffecting all countries that want to see justice and \r\npeace, whether we are talking about Al-Qaida in the \r\nIslamic Maghreb, Al-Shabaab, Boko Haram or the \r\nIslamic State, terrorism remains a threat to the entire \r\nworld and must grasp the attention of all world leaders, \r\nwho, regardless of their ideological or religious beliefs, \r\nmust work to eradicate this scourge.\r\nThe Central African Republic is not spared those \r\nthreats because, in addition to the armed groups \r\nslaughtering the civilian population and going \r\nunpunished, my country has, for more than a decade, \r\nbeen facing Joseph Kony’s Lord’s Resistance Army \r\nlaying waste to the south-east of the country. The porous \r\nborders in the north-east and north-west of the country \r\nmean that the Central African Republic is a potential \r\nsanctuary, indeed a very likely sanctuary, for terrorists \r\nin particular from Boko Haram, at present in Nigeria \r\nand Cameroon. That is why the re-establishment of \r\nsecurity and State authority throughout our country is \r\n15-29701 25/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nof the greatest priority in order to prevent the Central \r\nAfrican Republic becoming an area where terrorists can \r\nfall back, recruit new members and gain new supplies.\r\nIn addition to armed conflict and terrorism we \r\nmust also face poverty and the HIV/AIDS and Ebola \r\npandemics, which render the situation of the majority of \r\nthe planet’s people ever more precarious. That requires \r\nincreased international solidarity among countries a \r\nsustained partnership between Governments and civil \r\nsociety to bring about eradication.\r\nAnother major challenge we face today is that of \r\nclimate change. This only exacerbates geographical, \r\nsocial and ecological inequalities, with their sad \r\nconsequences of poverty, the migration crisis and \r\nthe reduction of resources for future and current \r\ngenerations. My country, which is part of the Congo \r\nBasin, contributes by way of its forests preserving the \r\necological balance in the world. Nevertheless, we are \r\nclassfied as one of the poorest countries in the world, \r\nand therefore one of the most vulnerable.\r\nOur development priorities remain adaptation \r\nto the negative impact of climate change by means \r\nof support from the international community to gain \r\naccess for southern hemisphere countries to additional \r\nfunding and the transfer of technology. In that regard, \r\nthe outcome of the upcoming meeting to be held in \r\nParis in December will send a strong signal to the \r\ndecision-makers of the planet to work together to provide \r\nfuture generations with a world where it will be good \r\nto live. The Central African Republic strongly supports \r\nthat process and will participate in the meeting.\r\nOther challenges, such as related to respect for \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and good governance, are \r\npreconditions for peace and lasting security. However, \r\nrespect of human rights must not be an excuse for \r\nimpunity. There must be a framework of equitable \r\njustice, meaning that those responsible for serious \r\ncrimes can be held to account.\r\nRespecting human rights also means the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, respect for freedom \r\nof expression and the preservation of the territorial \r\nintegrity of States. In that regard, the Central African \r\nRepublic remains of the belief that conflict prevention \r\nand conflict settlement by peaceful means are the best \r\nways to maintain and ensure international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nThat is why my country continues to support the \r\nprinciple of the political settlement of the question \r\nof the Moroccan Sahara within the framework of the \r\nguidelines defined by the United Nations. My country \r\nwelcomes the encouraging positions of the Security \r\nCouncil expressed through the several resolutions \r\nthat have been adopted since 2007, which lay down a \r\ncredible basis for a political settlement, one mutually \r\nacceptable to the various parties. The Central African \r\nRepublic remains firmly committed to this process \r\nunder the aegis of the United Nations.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nprovides us with an opportunity to think about \r\nreforming the organs of the Organization to adapt them \r\nto the realities of today’s world. We therefore have \r\nto move towards a new way to achieve world peace \r\nand security with a reform of the principal organ, the \r\nSecurity Council, to make it more democratic and \r\nmore representative of the various continents, as well \r\nas more accessible to the countries of the South. The \r\nCentral African Republic supports the process of such \r\nreform, which will mean that it will prove easier for the \r\nUnited Nations to meet the expectations of countries \r\nwhen it comes to responding to international issues. My \r\ncountry also calls for limiting the use of the veto in \r\nsituations of conflict or disaster where there are risks of \r\nmass crimes and crimes against humanity. My country \r\nstrongly supports the initiative of France and Mexico \r\nin that regard.\r\nI wish to express the hope that this seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly will be a historic \r\noccasion on which world leaders will unanimously \r\nand bravely enter into a commitment to revitalize the \r\nOrganization with the same determination as their \r\nforebears 70 years ago.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in the exercise \r\nof the right of reply, may I remind members that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first statement and to 5 minutes \r\nfor the second and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Abishek Singh (India): It is regrettable that \r\nthe delegation of Pakistan has once again chosen to \r\nmisuse the high-level segment of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to distort reality and portray a false \r\nsense of the picture of the challenges in our region (see \r\n26/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nA/70/PV.19). Pakistan claims to be the primary victim \r\nof terrorism. In truth, it is actually a victim of its own \r\npolicies of breeding and sponsoring terrorists. To seek \r\nto mask its activities as though an outcome of domestic \r\ndiscontent in the Indian State of Jammu and Kashmir \r\ncarries no credibility with the world.\r\nIt was stated that Jammu and Kashmir was under \r\nforeign occupation. It is, except that the occupier in \r\nquestion is Pakistan. In fact, India’s reservations about \r\nthe proposed China-Pakistan economic corridor stem \r\nfrom the fact that it passes through Indian territory \r\nillegally occupied by Pakistan for many years.Pakistan \r\napparently regrets that the dispute over Jammu and \r\nKashmir remains unresolved and that our dialogue \r\nhas not progressed. If that is so, it is because Pakistan \r\nhas chosen to disregard its commitments, whether \r\nunder the 1972 Shimla agreement, the 2004 joint \r\ndeclaration forswearing terrorism, or, more recently, \r\nthe understanding between our Prime Ministers at Ufa. \r\nOn each occasion, it is India that has extended the hand \r\nof friendship. India remains open even today to engage \r\nPakistan on outstanding issues in an atmosphere free of \r\nterrorism and violence.\r\nReference was made to ceasefire violations and \r\nthe exchange of fire along the Line of Control and \r\nthe international boundary. The world knows that the \r\nprimary reason for firing is to provide cover to terrorists \r\ncrossing the border. It requires no imagination to \r\nfigure out which side initiates such exchanges. It is not \r\nuncommon for States, when confronted with serious \r\nchallenges, to shift responsibility on to others. That is \r\nthe case with Pakistan and terrorism, which reflects \r\nan inability to recognize that this is a home-grown \r\nproblem that has begun to bite the hand that fed it. We \r\nagree that terrorism has underlying causes: in this case \r\npoverty of wisdom and ignorance of consequences.\r\nThe heart of the matter is a State that regards the \r\nuse of terrorism as a legitimate instrument of statecraft. \r\nThe world watches with concern as its consequences \r\nhave spread beyond its immediate neighbourhood. All \r\nof us stand prepared to help if only the creators of this \r\nmonster wake up to the dangers of what they have done \r\nto themselves.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): It was not my intention \r\nto take the f loor today, but I was forced to do so because \r\nof the accusations that were made by the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Azerbaijan.\r\nLet me start with a quote from a favourite band of \r\nmine, Iron Maiden:\r\n“Ever had a conversation that you realize you’ve \r\nhad before? Have you ever talked to someone, and \r\nyou feel you know what’s coming next? It feels \r\npre-arranged, ‘cause you know that you’ve heard \r\nit before, and you feel that this moment in time is \r\nsurreal, ‘cause you know when you feel deja-vu.”\r\nI was feeling déjà vu today, because it seemed that \r\nwhatever I heard today I went through it a few days \r\nago — yesterday, the day before yesterday, the other \r\nday — and it seems to be the same constant accusations. \r\nStrangely enough, a few weeks ago was the one \r\nhundred and fiftieth anniversary of the publication of \r\nLewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and \r\nThrough the Looking Glass. Surprisingly, the statement \r\nthat has been delivered at this meeting is exactly from \r\nthat fairy tale. Everything was vice versa. Everything \r\nwas confusing. Everything was upside down. I was \r\nwondering if that is also the case of “the best defence is \r\ngood offence”. Probably that is the idea behind all these \r\naccusations.\r\nThere is probably a problem with short memory. \r\nBut the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan is not \r\ntoo young to himself remember what happened 20 or \r\n25 years ago — how Azerbaijan initiated the war against \r\nArmenia, against the people of Nagorno-Karabakh. \r\nBut it is also not surprising, because no one is left in \r\nAzerbaijan to write the truth today. Everybody is behind \r\nbars. Any free speech, any journalist, any blogger who \r\nis willing to write about the truth in Azerbaijan is \r\nimmediately arrested.\r\nLet me touch upon a couple of issues that were \r\nraised in the statement. Just before coming to New \r\nYork, and I am from the Ministry for Foreign Affairs, I \r\nhad a meeting with representatives of the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and discussed the \r\nissues of the possibility of finally arranging a meeting \r\nbetween the two countries’ committees on missing \r\npersons. Armenia has been repeating this appeal \r\nthrough the ICRC to Azerbaijan for the past 10 years, \r\nprobably constantly. We passed on our request to the \r\nICRC. The response is constant. Unfortunately, the \r\nAzerbaijani committee on missing persons has refused \r\nto hold the next meeting. That has been the response for \r\nthe last 10 years.\r\nWith regard to militarization, I was simply \r\nsurprised at the accusations of the Azerbaijani \r\n15-29701 27/28\r\n30/09/2015 A/70/PV.21\r\nMinister — again putting everything upside down. \r\nThe Azerbaijani President’s statement recently calling \r\nArmenia, including its capital, Yerevan, its own land \r\nis simply surprising and appalling. I would simply \r\nsuggest that the Azerbaijani speech writers have a look \r\nat the maps — ancient maps, mediaeval maps, maps of \r\nthe pre-Soviet Union times, but definitely not the ones \r\nthat are drawn in Azerbaijan based on the imagination \r\nof Azerbaijani scholars, one of whom has declared \r\neven that Noah was of Azerbaijani origin. Nowhere is \r\nit acceptable, no militaristic rhetoric is acceptable and \r\nlogical.\r\nDo not frighten us with the possibility of war. It was \r\nthe result of that war of Azerbaijan trying to annihilate \r\nthe Armenian population that they lost. Instead of \r\nthat, think about negotiations based on compromises. \r\nAzerbaijan has also probably forgotten the fact of \r\nthe mujahideen and other mercenaries fighting in \r\nthe Azerbaijani army against Armenia, and killing \r\npeaceful civilians.\r\nMaybe the Azerbaijani Minister is also not aware \r\nof hundreds of its citizens fighting among fighters of \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, who every now \r\nand then also appear on the Armenian border or the \r\nborder of Nagorno-Karabakh. If Azerbaijan wanted \r\npeace in the region, they definitely would be willing \r\nto allow international observers along the international \r\nborder and the line of contact to have an impartial body \r\nannounce who is responsible for ceasefire violations. \r\nBut they will not allow that. The Armenian Ministry \r\nof Defence has always confirmed its readiness to do it. \r\nThat says a lot, I think.\r\nLet me, in conclusion, paraphrase the words of the \r\nAzerbaijani speaker’s statement. Nagorno-Karabakh \r\nhas never been and will never be part of Azerbaijan, \r\nregardless of how many times that is repeated.\r\nFinally, I should also like to address briefly the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Turkey (see \r\nA/70/PV.19). It was mentioned that major conflicts in \r\nthe greater Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe area remained unresolved, and that aTurkey \r\nwas determined to continue its efforts to facilitate a \r\npeaceful resolution to those conflicts on the basis of \r\nrespect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and the \r\ninviolability of internationally recognized borders. \r\nWhat about the people’s right to self-determination, I \r\nwould ask? If that is the position of Turkey, I can assure \r\nthe Assembly that no one can facilitate a solution based \r\non a one-sided, biased, predetermined or prejudged \r\napproach.\r\nMr. Mammadov (Azerbaijan): It is indeed \r\nregrettable that we need to take the f loor at such a \r\nlate hour. In fact, the slanderous statement by the \r\nrepresentative of Armenia prompted us to take the f loor. \r\nI would appreciate it if the representative of Armenia \r\nlimited himself to entertaining with fairy tales, rather \r\nthan trying to mislead the General Assembly here.\r\nAs for history, of course we appreciate history in \r\nour region. I should just like to remind him that, only \r\n100 years ago, Armenia was a vibrant, multi-ethnic \r\narea where Armenians constituted a minority of 4 to \r\n5 per cent of the population, including its now capital, \r\nYerevan.\r\nAs for the comments on human rights, a country, \r\nhalf of whose population left, has no right whatsoever \r\nto speak on human rights. All major human rights \r\nactivists left the country. They simply f led the country, \r\nincluding f leeing to Azerbaijan. Just recently one of \r\nthem came to Azerbaijan.\r\nIn terms of the responsibility of Armenia, it is well \r\nestablished, including as noted by my Minister in the \r\nrecent judgement of the European Court of Human \r\nRights, whose jurisdiction Armenia has voluntarily \r\naccepted, and many other international organizations in \r\naddition to the United Nations, such as the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, some declarations of the Conference on \r\nInteraction and Confidence Building Measures in Asia \r\nand so on. Lastly, the President of Armenia himself \r\nadmitted the fact of occupying Azerbaijan territories.\r\nAs for terrorism, Armenia is probably the only \r\ncountry in the world that venerates convicted terrorists, \r\nerects monuments to them and receives convicted \r\nterrorists at the highest political level, including by \r\nPrime Ministers.\r\nAzerbaijan, contrary to what Armenia tries to \r\npresent, is not against any type of investigation that \r\nbrings about the truth. Azerbaijan has been pressing for \r\na long time for an investigation into all the violations \r\nof international law, most notably war crimes, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and crimes against peace. That is \r\nsomething in the interests of Azerbaijan and in the \r\ninterests of the international community, but not in the \r\ninterests of the military junta of Armenia, which is led \r\nby war criminals. It would be in the best interests of \r\nArmenia and the people of Armenia if its Government \r\n28/28 15-29701\r\nA/70/PV.21 30/09/2015\r\nputs an end to aggression and engages in good-\r\nneighbourly relations with its neighbours, and thus \r\nworks towards the prosperity and development of its \r\nown population and the region.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): It is difficult to argue \r\nwith words that basically do not make any sense and, \r\nsurprisingly, also are harassing. I would call upon \r\nthe presidency to stop or interrupt meetings when \r\nthe leadership of a neighbouring country, or any \r\nother country, is making some sort of incriminating \r\naccusations.\r\nFirst and foremost, I should like to recall that \r\nI represent a country that is home to 12 national \r\nminorities who live happily and peacefully in Armenia. \r\nAmong some of those nationalities are those who do \r\nnot have their own State but who have all the rights \r\nand privileges of the citizens of Armenia; also, no \r\nArmenian national is currently residing in Azerbaijan. \r\nIn Baku — a city that was populated by Armenians, \r\nRussians and Jews in the early twentieth century, where \r\nthe entire oil industry was started by Armenians — is \r\ntoday devoid of a single Armenian. Luckily, with the \r\ncollapse of the Soviet Union and the demisre of the \r\nrepublics, Nagorno-Karabakh was able to declare its \r\nindependence and became home for the Armenian \r\npopulation of Nagorno-Karabakh and many Armenians \r\nwho fled from the massacres in Baku, Sumqayit and \r\nKirovabad.\r\nThe only international organization that has a \r\nreal mandate to negotiate a peaceful settlement on the \r\nNagorno-Karabakh conflict is the Minsk Group of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \r\nThe co-Chairs of the Minsk Group — Russia, France \r\nand the United States, are doing a wonderful job. They \r\nhave been negotiating and mediating very hard among \r\nthe parties to find a solution based on compromise and \r\nthe principles of international law, which includes the \r\ninterests of all parties and those of self-determination, \r\nterritorial integrity and, first and foremost, the non-use \r\nof force or the threat of force.\r\nThe best solution is not to engage in counter-\r\nattacks, counter-offensives, especially in the artillery \r\nfight on the border, but to engage truly and sincerely \r\nin negotiation. That, of course, is if the opposing \r\nparty is really interested in finding a solution, and not \r\ncontinuing its militaristic policy.\r\nMr. Mammadov (Azerbaijan): The second \r\nstatement by the representative of Armenia is again \r\nfull of distortions — or outright lies — and is contrary \r\nto the spirit of constructive debate here at the United \r\nNations.\r\nAs for statistics, in our day they are widely \r\navailable: w refer to the official statistics of Armenia. \r\nHow can a country 99.9 per cent of whose population \r\nbelongs to one titular nation be called multi-ethnic? \r\nIt is a mono-ethnic country. While mono-ethnicity is \r\nnot bad in itself, it has been achieved through ethnic \r\ncleansing. That is the point.\r\nAs for violations across the front line and the zone, \r\nAzerbaijan is for the withdrawal of all illegal armed \r\nformations from its own territories, and all foreign \r\nmilitary forces taht are unlawfully stationed in the \r\nterritory of Azerbaijan. It would be more appropriate if \r\nthe representative of Armenia did not misinterpret the \r\nsubstance of the peace process and the proposals of the \r\nco-Chairs of the Minsk Group.\r\nThe principles that the Armenian representative \r\ntried to misinterpret have nothing in common with \r\nwhat they are in reality, including the principle of self-\r\ndetermination — a famous Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe principle that clearly \r\nsets forth self-determination in conformity with the \r\nterritorial integrity of States. In any case, it would be \r\nin the best Armenian interests and in the interests of \r\nthe United Nations and the international community if \r\nthe illegal use of force against the territorial integrity \r\nand sovereignty of Azerbaijan were terminated so that \r\ngood-neighbourly relations in our region could become \r\na reality.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.55 p.m.\r\n"
