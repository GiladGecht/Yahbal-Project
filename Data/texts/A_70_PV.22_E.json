We agreed that our achievements, \r\nas well as our mistakes and failures, of the past decades \r\nformed a sufficiently solid foundation to transform the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) into a reality, rather than a utopia.\r\nThe determination and unity that we have \r\ndemonstrated in creating and adopting the new \r\nAgenda have a special symbolism this year as we \r\nmark the seventieth anniversary of the Organization \r\nthat continues to bring us all together, big and small \r\ncountries alike, and has never ceased to be a beacon of \r\nhope in times of despair.\r\nThe anniversary that we are celebrating also \r\noffers us an opportunity to analyse and evaluate the \r\ndegree of progress that we have made individually and \r\ncollaboratively in achieving the objectives set out in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We do that in the context \r\nof today’s highly dynamic global environment, which \r\ncontinues to bring in new challenges.\r\nThose challenges are many, and it is increasingly \r\ndifficult to predict the consequences of our failure to \r\naddress them effectively. The crisis in Syria was, until \r\nonly recently, merely a crisis in one country in one \r\nregion of the Middle East. Not long ago, the refugee \r\nand the migrant crisis of the Syrian people materialized \r\non our country’s own borders and reminded us that \r\nevents in other places and regions and events at our \r\nown borders are closely intertwined and inseparable in \r\ntoday’s global environment.\r\nThe number of refugees and displaced persons \r\nf leeing destruction and death, leaving their homes and \r\nseeking a safe haven, is increasing literally each hour. \r\nFor the majority of countries, the waves of refugees that \r\narrive confront them with a heavier burden than they \r\nare able to manage. In addition, the tragedies involving \r\ninnocent victims — especially and unforgivably \r\nchildren — place a great sense of responsibility \r\nnot only on individual States, but also on the entire \r\ninternational community. They also test the limits of \r\nhuman solidarity and empathy. At the same time, it is \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.22\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n22nd plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 1 October 2015, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\na warning to us that we must find urgent and effective \r\nsolutions.\r\nWe are therefore very concerned at the deterioration \r\nin the devastating conflict in Syria, which continues to \r\ndestabilize the region and presents an extremely serious \r\nthreat to international peace and security. Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina strongly condemns the unspeakable \r\nsuffering and torture that the Syrian people are being \r\nsubjected to. In that regard, we support the efforts of \r\nthe Secretary-General, the United Nations and the \r\nbroader international community to find a political and \r\npeaceful solution to the crisis in Syria. We believe that \r\nit is essential that the political transition in Syria be \r\nconducted in accordance with the Geneva communiqué \r\nof 2012 (S/2012/522, annex).\r\nWe are also carefully monitoring the situation \r\nin Yemen. We are very concerned about the political \r\ndestabilization of that country and the deterioration in the \r\nsecurity and humanitarian situation there, which have, \r\nto date, taken on intolerable proportions in that country. \r\nWe call on all sides to come to a peaceful settlement of \r\nall the outstanding issues in order to establish a lasting \r\npeace and to allow, without delay, the distribution of \r\nhumanitarian aid to the civilian population. In that \r\ncontext, the safety of the humanitarian-aid staff and the \r\nUnited Nations staff must be ensured.\r\nAs for the situation in Ukraine, we hope that \r\nthe parties to that conflict will adhere to the peace \r\nagreement reached in Minsk as the basis for a lasting \r\nsolution.\r\nTerrorism and violent extremism are, without \r\nany doubt, the most serious of all the challenges we \r\nface today. The ideology of such groups, which is \r\ncharacterized by an absolute disregard for human life, \r\nis seriously undermining the fundamental values and \r\nachievements of civilization.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina supports the full \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and the work of the Counter-Terrorism \r\nCommittee, the activities of which have already shown \r\nresults in strengthening intergovernmental cooperation \r\nand improving the capacity of individual Member \r\nStates in that area. Bosnia and Herzegovina is a member \r\nof the Global Coalition to Counter the Islamic State in \r\nIraq and the Levant, established in 2014 and led by the \r\nUnited States, and it is one of the countries providing \r\nmaterial assistance to the Government of Iraq as part \r\nof that effort.\r\nAs the Chair of the Council of Europe, our country \r\nleads the Council’s actions in the fight against terrorism, \r\nparticularly through strengthening the legal framework, \r\npursuant to the provisions of Security Council resolution \r\n2178 (2014). The adoption of the Additional Protocol to \r\nthe Council of Europe Convention on the Prevention \r\nof Terrorism, adopted by the Committee of Ministers \r\nin May 2015, is a significant step in the fight against \r\nterrorism. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nemphasize the importance of article 7 of the Additional \r\nProtocol, which provides for the parties to exchange \r\ninformation among the designated points of contact \r\navailable on a 24-hour, seven-days-a-week basis.\r\nA limited military response, when used as the \r\nonly instrument in the fight against terrorism in all \r\nits forms and manifestations, has accomplished only \r\nshort-lived results. Along with decisive, thorough, \r\ndedicated and well-coordinated military action, there \r\nmust be a comprehensive strategy and holistic approach \r\nto combating violent extremism and terrorism, which \r\nshould be aimed at addressing the root causes of the \r\nphenomenon. Among other measures, reducing poverty \r\nand inequality, improving education and providing \r\nopportunities to young generations are extremely \r\nimportant, even crucial. Furthermore, eliminating the \r\neffects of prejudice and xenophobia in our societies \r\nand communities also remains essential, if we wish to \r\ncounter the spread of the ideology of violent extremism.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina welcomes the extremely \r\nimportant agreement on the Iranian nuclear programme, \r\nreached in Vienna in July 2015. We believe that that \r\nhistoric agreement is evidence of the true superiority \r\nof diplomatic efforts and the parties’ determination to \r\nfind a peaceful solution. The agreement can serve as a \r\nguideline for the resolution of other crisis situations.\r\nUndoubtedly, the United Nations offers a guarantee \r\nof collective responsibility and security, notably through \r\nthe greater use of preventive diplomacy and mediation, \r\nsolid and carefully planned mandates for peacekeeping \r\noperations, and instruments for building lasting peace. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has endeavoured to share \r\nits vast experience in peacebuilding and democratic \r\ntransition, particularly through our membership since \r\nJanuary 2014 in the Organizational Committee of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We support all activities \r\nand peace initiatives aimed at conflict prevention, \r\nand we actively contribute to collective security on a \r\nglobal scale. By participating in the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions in South Sudan, Cyprus, \r\n15-29658 3/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nSomalia, Afghanistan, the Congo and Mali, we \r\ncontribute in the most direct way to maintaining and \r\nbuilding world peace.\r\nFollowing the suggestions of the United Nations, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina has had a significant \r\nparticipation of female police officers among our \r\npeacekeeping mission personnel; they now account for \r\nmore than 20 per cent of the total number of our mission \r\npersonnel. While our contribution to peacekeeping \r\noperations, in terms of numbers, is not as large as some \r\nparticipating countries with far larger military and \r\npolice forces, we are very proud of the bravery of our \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina police officers in peacekeeping \r\nmissions around the world.\r\nThe degree of equality of women and girls \r\ncompared to men with regard to certain rights has \r\nremained at a high level for decades in my country. \r\nWe have always considered women to be the pillars \r\nof the family and communities and the bearers of \r\nour society’s development. Today, in the light of the \r\nevents that my country has endured, we are convinced \r\nthat women can be a major factor in reconciliation as \r\nwell. We will therefore invest still greater efforts into \r\nadvancing women’s interests, primarily as the best way \r\nto heal our society, mend what was broken, strengthen \r\nthe family and enable women’s further development on \r\nthe basis of full equality. As a member of the Executive \r\nBoard of UN-Women, Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\ncontinues to invest efforts in promoting human rights \r\nat the international level, particularly through the \r\nstrengthening of the status of women in accordance \r\nwith the Beijing Platform for Action and the Goals of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nExactly 20 years ago, Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nachieved a long-desired peace. Today, we are \r\nintensively working on implementing a reform agenda \r\naimed at improving socioeconomic conditions and the \r\nrule of law in our country. At the same time, we are \r\nimplementing the obligations that we have accepted \r\nunder the Stabilization and Association Agreement of \r\nthe European Union, the first of its kind for my country \r\nwith the European Union, which came into force four \r\nmonths ago. The next step for my country is to submit \r\nits membership application and achieve the status of a \r\ncandidate country.\r\nAt the same time, we are working to build a society \r\nthat is fair and equitable and that offers parity. I can \r\nassure the Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina’s \r\nstrong belief that our past experiences and the lessons \r\nlearned can contribute to solving numerous challenges \r\nat both the regional and the international levels. Our \r\ncandidacy for membership in the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil for the period 2017-2019 should be viewed in \r\nthat light. We are taking part in the general efforts to \r\nachieve a better and more unified world through those \r\nand similar activities.\r\nOur commitment to full respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms and the strengthening \r\nof democracy and multicultural dialogue and our \r\nrespect for ethnic, cultural and religious diversity \r\nare unquestionable. In that regard, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina will spare no efforts to combat all forms \r\nof discrimination and intolerance against members of \r\nany part of society, as enshrined in our Constitution. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is a complex, multi-ethnic \r\nState. In the light of the benefits and advantages that our \r\ndiversity creates, acknowledged even in harsh times, \r\nwe know precisely how important it is to protect all \r\nindividual and collective rights and to bring them into \r\nmutual harmony in line with the relevant international \r\nhuman rights standards. We attach great importance to \r\nregional cooperation, and we are fully committed to \r\nbuilding good relations with our neighbours on the basis \r\nof the principles of friendship and openness. We are \r\naware that that is the only path to stability in the region \r\nof South-East Europe, which has often been turbulent \r\nin the past. Solely on that foundation can all countries \r\nin the region attain a full European perspective.\r\nAlthough not at the top of today’s list of priorities \r\nfor Bosnia and Herzegovina, climate change is among \r\nthe most important globally. Climate change determines \r\nnot only our future but also that of our children and their \r\ndescendants. We have felt the consequences of global \r\nclimate change in Bosnia and Herzegovina, notably in \r\nthe past year during the devastating f loods, when many \r\nof our citizens were forced to leave their homes. Unlike \r\nmany other parts of our planet, Bosnia and Herzegovina \r\nis rich in large quantities of clean, potable water, which \r\nis becoming increasingly invaluable and rare in the \r\nworld we live in. However, that fact is something that \r\nwe can no longer take for granted, especially when \r\nwe realize how helpless and weak we are before the \r\nforces of nature and the countless abuses that we have \r\nsubjected our environment to. Therefore, along with \r\nthe other Member States, we place our hopes on the \r\nupcoming twenty-first session o fthe Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Paris in December. We also call \r\nupon the parties to the Convention to redouble their \r\n4/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nefforts in order to reach a legally binding universal \r\nclimate change agreement.\r\nFinally, we realize that the United Nations will \r\nneed to undergo change in order to continue to be able \r\nto respond to our increasingly complex requests and \r\nexpectations. The seventieth anniversary is an occasion \r\nfor celebration, as well as for critical consideration and \r\nreaffirmation of the values enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Bosnia and Herzegovina remains \r\nfully committed to the paramount ideals of freedom, \r\ndignity and economic development for all nations and \r\nfor the world, ideals that should be enjoyed by every \r\nliving being on the planet.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Chairman of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Dragan Čović, Chairman of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Michel Joseph Martelly, President \r\nof the Republic of Haiti\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Haiti.\r\nMr. Michel Joseph Martelly, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Michel Joseph Martelly, President of \r\nthe Republic of Haiti, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Martelly (spoke in French): Mr. President, \r\nI would like to express my warmest congratulations to \r\nyou on your election as President of our prestigious \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. Your proven \r\nexperience in international affairs, combined with your \r\nesteemed personal qualities, bode well for the success \r\nof this session of the General Assembly.\r\nIn this pivotal year, when the Organization is \r\ncelebrating its seventieth anniversary, I would like \r\nto commend the efforts of the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, and associate myself with the \r\nunanimous tributes paid to him for his commitment to \r\npromoting peace and sustainable development and to \r\nthe fight against climate change. The people and the \r\nGovernment of Haiti are particularly grateful for the \r\nspirit of solidarity that he has always shown with regard \r\nto our country in its ongoing struggle to strengthen our \r\ndemocracy.\r\nIn a world where, in the words of His Holiness \r\nPope Francis, speaking at the World Meeting of Popular \r\nMovements, “global interdependence calls for global \r\nanswers to local problems”, the challenge to the United \r\nNations today is to reinvent itself, to reform itself \r\nand, above all, to be the bearer of a new vision of our \r\nshared future, a vision capable of reviving the original \r\nf lame and of reuniting Member States around a grand \r\ncollective plan focused on the bedrock of core values on \r\nwhich the Organization is built.\r\nIn that respect, we welcome a number of recent \r\ndiplomatic breakthroughs that bring glimmers of hope \r\nin international relations. The restoration of diplomatic \r\nrelations between the United States of America and Cuba \r\nis undoubtedly a historic breakthrough. It allows us to \r\nanticipate greater serenity in hemispheric relations. The \r\nRepublic of Haiti can only rejoice at that development. \r\nWe pay tribute to the vision, pragmatism and leadership \r\nshown by the American and Cuban Heads of State, who \r\nopened a new chapter in the relations between the two \r\ncountries.\r\nSimilarly, we welcome the signing of the agreement \r\nbetween the Islamic Republic of Iran and the group of \r\nsix countries on the Iranian nuclear issue and the détente \r\nthat has resulted from it. I also welcome the atmosphere \r\nof cordiality and fraternal dialogue that now governs \r\nthe relations between the People’s Republic of China \r\nand Taiwan. We have no doubt that the new momentum \r\nin their relations will significantly contribute to a much-\r\nhoped-for thaw among all the countries of South-East \r\nAsia, moving beyond their differences and divergences. \r\nThe Republic of Haiti encourages the spirit of dialogue \r\nprevailing in the relations between nations, which seeks \r\nto reach peaceful solutions to their conflicts.\r\nThe Syrian crisis is a real affront to the conscience \r\nof humankind. Non-State entities are expanding their \r\ngrip every day, particularly in Iraq and Syria, engaging \r\nin intolerable atrocities against civilian populations and \r\nin the destruction of world cultural-heritage sites. Such \r\nthreats, which are of an exceptional scale and gravity, \r\npose a challenge to the international community. We \r\nhave a clear obligation to adopt all collective measures \r\nnecessary so as to ensure international security and \r\nrespect for human rights. We must redouble our efforts \r\nto oppose with determination the barbarism of terrorist \r\n15-29658 5/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nentities and their criminal acts that endanger our shared \r\nvalues. There can be no real peace or security if the \r\ninternational community shows weakness towards \r\nthose who violate international public order.\r\nIt goes without saying that we cannot hope for \r\neffective responses to the global challenges of our time \r\nwithout narrowing the North-South divide, without an \r\nintensification of the fight against poverty, and without \r\na proactive response to environmental crises that aff lict, \r\nabove all, the poorest countries. Strengthening the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations means strengthening \r\nits ability to act quickly and intervene effectively in \r\nmaintaining peace and security, especially when it \r\ncomes to preventing major crisis situations, calming \r\nrecurring sources of tension or resolving conflicts that \r\nhave gone on for too long.\r\nI would like to discuss the situation of my country, \r\nthe Republic of Haiti. On 9 August, an important stage \r\nin the consolidation of democracy in Haiti was reached. \r\nAn independent electoral council, chosen by civil \r\nsociety, launched the electoral process that will lead \r\nto presidential, legislative, municipal and territorial \r\nelections before the end of this year.\r\nA year ago, in his report to the Security Council \r\non the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \r\n(MINUSTAH), the Secretary-General noted that \r\nholding inclusive elections was\r\n“essential for ... the consolidation of democracy \r\nand the rule of law and to promote socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment, which is necessary to improve the \r\nliving conditions of the population and achieve \r\nenduring stability” (S/2014/617, para. 62).\r\nI am pleased to confirm to the General Assembly \r\nthat my country is on track. The Haitian people has \r\ndemonstrated political maturity and the ability to \r\ntake control of its destiny. I wish to express my deep \r\ngratitude to all of Haiti’s cooperation partners and to \r\nthe United Nations for the scale of the support provided \r\nin the preparation and holding of the electoral contests. \r\nThe success of the elections will be an important \r\nmilestone on the country’s road to stability and in the \r\npolitical transition in 2016. That will be a key indicator \r\nof the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti’s \r\nsound performance and success over the past 11 years.\r\nSignificant progress has been made in Haiti, \r\nespecially during the past four years. I can say \r\nthat, under my Administration, democracy was \r\nconsolidated, institutions guaranteeing the rule of law \r\nwere strengthened, the situation in terms of the security \r\nenvironment has improved significantly, and human \r\nrights have been promoted and respected. Never has \r\nthe number of international conventions ratified by the \r\ncountry — on the protection of human rights, the rights \r\nof children, women and vulnerable people — been \r\nmore substantial. At the same time, extreme poverty \r\nhas declined, foreign direct investment has shown a \r\nnet expansion, and, after decades of stagnation, the \r\neconomy has returned to growth.\r\nIn terms of the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nmuch progress has been reported. Haiti has reached the \r\ntarget for the reduction in the prevalence of underweight \r\nchildren under 5 years of age, three years ahead of \r\nschedule. Thanks to the universal education enrolment \r\nprogramme, which is compulsory and free and was set \r\nup by my Administration, more than 1 million children \r\nhave been able to attend school. We have also seen \r\nprogress in access to safe drinking water, lower infant-\r\nmortality rates, the alleviation of extreme poverty and \r\nthe fight against social exclusion. In the field of public \r\nhealth, we have achieved undeniable success in the \r\nfight against HIV/AIDS and malaria.\r\nThe progress made in recent years was made possible \r\nthanks, in part, to the support of MINUSTAH. Those \r\nachievements represent an outstanding contribution \r\nto the country’s stability, without which there can be \r\nno serious possibility of economic modernization \r\nand sustainable development. MINUSTAH is in the \r\nprocess of adapting to a new environment, different \r\nfrom that prevailing when it was established. The \r\nHaitian Government prefers a reconfiguration plan \r\nthat takes into account the evolving situation on the \r\nground. I reiterate our desire to see the gradual, orderly \r\nwithdrawal of the Mission’s troops. The withdrawal \r\nof troops and the transfer of responsibilities to the \r\nHaitian authorities in matters of the military, police \r\nand development must be made according to an agreed \r\ncalendar, thereby avoiding any undermining of the \r\ncountry’s internal or external security.\r\nDefence and security issues are of primary \r\nimportance for my Administration. I have strengthened \r\nthe National Police and have developed a new defence \r\npolicy, with support from the Inter-American Defence \r\nBoard, through the adoption of a white paper calling for \r\nthe creation of a defence force in the country. The new \r\nforce will participate actively in Haiti’s development, \r\nwith a focus on environmental protection, rescue efforts \r\n6/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nin cases of natural disaster, securing our borders and \r\nstrengthening the protection of investments.\r\nAs the end of my term approaches, I am pleased \r\nand proud to have worked and will continue to work \r\ntowards my country’s stability and strengthened \r\ndemocracy, thereby honouring my solemn commitments \r\nto the Haitian people, as well as to the international \r\ncommunity. I am especially grateful to the various \r\nUnited Nations bodies that have stood by us throughout.\r\nHaiti reaffirms its faith in the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the Organization’s \r\nefforts to promote peacebuilding and strengthen \r\ninternational solidarity. The elimination of extreme \r\npoverty is not beyond our reach; it is everyone’s \r\nbusiness. In that regard, the Republic of Haiti fully \r\nsupports the new Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nestablished pursuant to the new post-2015 development \r\nagenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and looks forward to \r\ntheir swift and effective implementation, together with \r\nthe appropriate resources.\r\nAt the time of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations, the spirit that presided over its creation \r\nis more than ever alive. Faced with unprecedented \r\nglobal challenges, including the growing threat of \r\nglobal warming, Member States must ensure that the \r\nOrganization works to build the impetus needed to \r\nstrengthen it as a space for collaboration. A new dynamic \r\nis necessary in matters of peace and development, \r\nunder which every State agrees that the use of force \r\nmust be subject to law, where dialogue and the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes emerge as the cornerstone of \r\ninter-State relations and where the\r\n“recognition of the inherent dignity and of the \r\nequal and inalienable rights of all members of the \r\nhuman family is the foundation of freedom, justice \r\nand peace in the world”,\r\nas stated in resolution 217 A (III), of 10 December 1948, \r\nby which the General Assembly adopted the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Haiti for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Michel Joseph Martelly, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Madagascar.\r\nMr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic of \r\nMadagascar, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana \r\n(spoke in French): My first words are directed to the \r\nnew President of the General Assembly, His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, to whom I extend sincere \r\ncongratulations on his election to that post during this \r\nsession.\r\nI also thank the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership and tenacity \r\nin ensuring that our Organization remains the most \r\nappropriate and legitimate forum for solving the problems \r\nof the world.\r\nFor our part, we can attest to the active support of the \r\nUnited Nations during the election process in Madagascar. \r\nMoreover, since January, the United Nations has continued \r\nto support Madagascar through the Peacebuilding Fund.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is a \r\nhistoric one, as it coincides with the adoption of the new \r\npost-2015 development agenda in the form of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), \r\nthereby auguring an ambitious and promising future for \r\nour peoples. From the perspective of its 70 years, the \r\nUnited Nations remains a forum to whose long journey \r\nthe world can bear witness. It has overcome numerous \r\nchallenges, has both strengths and weaknesses, yet it has \r\nalways remained clear-sighted and committed to peace \r\nand security, and, above all, to the service of humankind.\r\nLet us take objectively assess its work over the past 70 \r\nyears. To be fair, we should assess them objectively. During \r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), poverty has been our main enemy. Yet today it \r\nis clear that poverty remains and inequality persists. Our \r\ngoal of eradicating extreme poverty has not been fully met, \r\n15-29658 7/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nalthough there has been significant progress. The MDGs \r\nhave largely contributed to growth in many countries and \r\nhave encouraged each country to redouble its efforts to \r\nadopt practical strategies to help avert difficulties. Today, \r\nthe new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) aspire to \r\nthat same vision. The Assembly has thereby shown a new \r\ncommitment in line with the requirements of our ever-\r\nchanging world, to which we must constantly adapt our \r\nstrategies.\r\nThe new post-2015 development Agenda will fuel our \r\nfuture actions aimed at creating noticeable and lasting \r\nimpacts for the benefit of humankind. We do not have \r\nthe right to fail to meet the expectations of our peoples. \r\nWe must ensure the well-being and the daily lives of our \r\npeoples, as enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nbecause today, extreme poverty still prevails in many \r\ncountries of the world, and threats to global security also \r\ndeserve our urgent attentionl. Terrorism, climate change \r\nand the recurring problems associated with poverty \r\nare factors pushing populations to f lee in the hope of a \r\nbetter future or simply a life of dignity. By adopting the \r\nnew post-2015 development Agenda, we are offering \r\nGovernments a solution for development that enables them \r\nto act effectively. Since its independence, Madagascar \r\nhas consistently promoted the same values as those of \r\nthe United Nations and has taken the same path as the \r\nOrganization in adopting policies and universal strategies.\r\nIn adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nthe world has just set the foundation for a new framework \r\nfor its development. Commitments have been made to \r\nleave future generations a better world, given our current \r\nnatural resources and the fact that they are not unlimited. \r\nWith that common aim, Madagascar would like to \r\nrenew its commitment to implementing the new post-\r\n2015 development Agenda, which will serve as a frame \r\nof reference and aid in the realization of our national \r\ndevelopment plan.\r\nThe global threat of climate change deserves our \r\nunwavering attention. We all have an obligation to achieve \r\nresults, faced with that global scourge. The coming twenty-\r\nfirst session of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nto be held in Paris in December, will provide the ideal \r\nframework for showing our solidarity in that fight. While \r\nt developing countries are not the main parties responsible \r\nfor the causes of climate change, they pay a heavy price \r\nfor it, especially because they lack the resources needed to \r\nconfront those challenges. Madagascar routinely suffers \r\nfrom the consequences of climate change, which have led \r\nto agricultural losses and the destruction of basic social \r\ninfrastructures and have often set back efforts to achieve \r\nsocioeconomic development.\r\nOn 24 September, we submitted our national \r\nproposal with a commitment to reducing greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions by 14 per cent and to increasing absorption \r\ncapacity to 32 per cent by 2030. With a view to protecting \r\nbiodiversity — and Madagascar holds a significant portion \r\nof that world heritage — we recently supported resolution \r\n69/314, entitled “Tackling illicit trafficking in wildlife”. \r\nIn addition, with regard to disaster-risk reduction, \r\nwe have been fully involved in the implementation of \r\nresolution 69/283, on the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030, adopted in June 2015, which \r\nwas designed to reduce disaster risks. The Malagasy \r\nGovernment focuses particular attention on its population, \r\nespecially the most vulnerable. Its visionary social \r\nprotection policy will enable it to significantly reduce the \r\nnumber of people living in extreme poverty by 2030, in \r\nline with the new post-2015 development agenda.\r\nThe country is also involved in the implementation of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s plan on the reduction of maternal \r\nmortality. We have launched a campaign to speed up the \r\nreduction of maternal mortality and another against early \r\nmarriage. In regard to food security, I would like to share \r\nour promising regional prospect to make Madagascar \r\nthe breadbasket of the Indian Ocean. Such fundamental \r\ntransformations must be based on support for the civil \r\nsector. Our men, women, youth and children must have \r\naccess to education, basic health care, security and \r\njustice. We have a young population, which commits us \r\nto meeting the challenge of education as well as training \r\nand job creation. It is our joint responsibility to offer our \r\nyoung people decent work.\r\nA new era is opening before us. New hope is being \r\nbuilt with the advent of the new Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. By meeting in this Hall today, each nation is \r\nproviding proof of its commitment to make progress on \r\nthose Goals. The SDGs must not simply be a reference \r\npoint and ready guide in the fight against poverty. All \r\nour actions must be capitalized on, brought together for \r\nsustainable human development, because there is no world \r\napart from that of humankind. All our efforts should be \r\nfocused on capitalizing on sustainable development, \r\nbecause human beings are our richest resource. Human \r\ncapital is both the stakeholder for and beneficiary of the \r\nSDGs. The development of human capital must be at the \r\nheart of all of our actions. Our peoples’ security, in all its \r\n8/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nforms, must be ensured so that we can move away from \r\nextreme poverty and vulnerability, which are becoming \r\nchronic.\r\nWe are convinced that wars, crises, conflicts and \r\ninsecurity are the root causes of systematic violations of \r\nhuman rights. In that light, peace and security remain the \r\nAchilles heel of all development strategies. It is through \r\nthat shared vision that Madagascar is pursuing its path \r\ntowards democracy and stability. We all agree that there \r\nis no real development without lasting peace and security.\r\nCybercrime, transnational organized crime and \r\nterrorism have become more pressing issues. We are \r\nfighting faceless enemies, and we must constantly adapt \r\nour strategies against those new threats. The security of \r\nour peoples must therefore be ensured in order to remove \r\nthem from poverty and vulnerability. We are engaged in \r\nmany forms of combat against urban and rural insecurity \r\nand are fighting against all kinds of trafficking and \r\nlooting, which impacts our natural resources on land and \r\nat sea. On that issue, our country will be the location \r\nfor the Maritime Information Fusion Centre, serving the \r\nIndian Ocean and East and Southern Africa with a view to \r\nassisting in combating maritime piracy, all types of illicit \r\ntrafficking and terrorism.\r\nWith regard to the democratic process of carrying \r\nout elections, Madagascar is in a good position to provide \r\na favourable environment for the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. Without institutional and \r\npolitical stability, the progress we envisage and to which \r\nthe population aspires will not be lasting and shared.\r\nIn the area of collective security, I would like to \r\npay tribute to the commitment of peacekeeping mission \r\npersonnel. Madagascar actively participates by sending \r\npeacekeeping officers. From this podium, we declare our \r\nintention to deploy, for the first time, an infantry battalion \r\nto peacekeeping operations by 2017.\r\nOn the topic of the fight against human trafficking, \r\nMadagascar has ratified the main relevant international \r\nlegal instruments on human rights, and it recently ratified \r\nthe International Convention on the Protection of the \r\nRights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their \r\nFamilies (resolution 45/158). As some in this Hall know, \r\nMadagascar has also sought to meet its international \r\ncommitments by regularly submitting its reports on \r\nhuman rights to the various human rights treaty bodies \r\nand to the Human Rights Council in the framework of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review, whose recommendations are \r\nimplemented through a national operational plan.\r\nThis year, Madagascar deposited its instrument of \r\nratification of the Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities. During a meeting in New York earlier \r\nin 2015, in keeping with its international commitments, \r\nMadagascar reaffirmed its commitment to promote \r\nwomen’s rights and renewed its previous commitment \r\nmade in Beijing. We are joining our efforts with those of \r\nothers in seeking to make the representation of countries \r\non the Security Council more equitable. It is only fair that \r\nthat opportunity be offered to under-represented regions \r\nsuch as Africa.\r\nThe General Assembly remains the body most suited \r\nto the task of  overcoming the major challenges associated \r\nwith the eradication of poverty and the disruptive effects \r\nof climate change. The issues of migration, peace and \r\nsecurity are no less important. The resolution of those \r\ncomplex problems constitutes a top priority among the \r\nSDGs and Africa’s Agenda 2063: The Africa We Want.\r\nMr. González Franco (Paraguay), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nGiven the momentum created by the newly adopted \r\n2030 Agenda, Madagascar foresees that the next 15 \r\nyears will be rich in collective action and solidarity. In \r\naccordance with the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, our \r\ncountry is committed to mobilizing its own resources \r\nand urges our international partners to do the same. \r\nAccordingly, we call upon the United Nations to \r\npropose the appropriate financing mechanisms and \r\nstructures to support economic and social development \r\npolicies and to combat poverty in developing countries.\r\nOfficial development assistance is necessary and \r\nimportant to support growth. The Northern countries’ \r\nsolidarity with those of the South must be effective. We \r\nmust support one another complementarily, because \r\nit is together that we will succeed and be able to to \r\nact and react in real time to the major challenges that \r\nare facing us. Our will and determination will guide \r\nus in quickening our stride to meet those challenges. \r\nI therefore unhesitatingly reiterate my call for the \r\nenhancement of the North-South dialogue and the \r\nstrengthening of global partnerships. In order to truly \r\nsupport development, the terms of funding must not in \r\nany way penalize those countries and peoples that are \r\nalready vulnerable.\r\nCan we have confidence in the future? Can our \r\nyoung people have confidence in the future? On this \r\nsolemn occasion, I urge my peers not to lose sight of \r\nthe commitment that we made 70 years ago, which \r\n15-29658 9/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nhas been reflected in the solid decisions that we have \r\ntaken throughout the years and not delay in taking \r\naction. The SDGs enable us to facilitate prevention and \r\nthe maintenance of peace, security and stability. The \r\nnew Agenda outlines new strategic directions that will \r\nguide us in forging the destiny of our peoples.\r\nMadagascar maintains its hope and faith in the \r\nUnited Nations for the next 70 years. A good portion of \r\nthe path has already been trodden, but the road remains \r\nlong. We must not be concerned about counting steps. \r\nThe challenges are immense, but never, since time \r\nimmemorial, have so many countries and leaders \r\ndemonstrated their will and commitment to move ahead \r\nso as to overcome and solve the problems of today’s \r\nworld. We must demonstrate that we are moving closer \r\nto a millennium of solidarity that transcends borders. \r\nThat requires the commitment and responsibility of \r\neach country and each leader.\r\nThis month we began laying down the foundations \r\nof a new edifice. Its completion depends only on us. \r\nRest assured that Madagascar will contribute to that \r\nendeavour.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Madagascar for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Peter M. Christian, President \r\nand Head of Government of the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nand Head of Government of the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia.\r\nMr. Peter M. Christian, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Peter \r\nM. Christian, President and Head of Government of the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Christian: From this rostrum, many \r\ngreat leaders of nations have spoken with great \r\neloquence and conviction on matters of great import \r\nto their own nation in particular and also to other \r\nnations in general. And in this Hall, we speak with the \r\nconfident hope that what we say here will not only be \r\nheard, but that it will give relevance to our efforts and \r\nmake a positive difference.\r\nToday, I stand before the Assembly as the President \r\nof a small Pacific island country to reinforce our \r\ncommitment to save the difference that we represent, \r\nwhile participating in the noble attempt to bring nations \r\ntogether and speak on subjects of mutual concern and \r\nbenefit to all. Some who saw my remarks for this \r\nmorning tell me that they are generic and expound \r\nno particular issue of controversy that might generate \r\nmurmurs in the Hall. They may be right. But that is \r\nonly because most of them do not live by the sea, at \r\nsea level and surrounded by the great Pacific Ocean, \r\nwhere we listen to the sound of the waves relentlessly \r\npounding on our islands, getting dangerously closer \r\nwith every successive wave.\r\nI will speak first on the much-debated issue of \r\nclimate change and its causes and effects on many \r\nsmall island States including my own, Micronesia, but I \r\nwill not go into details, because that is where the Devil \r\nis said to be king. I speak as an islander who has walked \r\nthe shores of many atoll islands in the Pacific. Where \r\nthere once were sandy beaches and coconut trees, now \r\nthere are none. I am told that that will continue. As \r\nislanders, we wonder why that is happening. Parents \r\ntoday show their children where their island used to \r\nextend in relation to the reefs offshore.\r\nWhile we wait in fear for the predicted and inevitable \r\nsea-level rise, other effects of global warming, like \r\nstronger ocean currents and more frequent typhoons, \r\ncontinue to wash away shorelines and topple trees, not \r\nwaiting for the sea to rise and drown the island. People \r\nwho live on these islands hear that some of the causes \r\nof sea-level rise have been identified, that much debate \r\nhas gone into validating these causes, and that there \r\nis now a general understanding and agreement on its \r\ncauses. They have also heard that there is a way to slow \r\ndown and eventually save what is left of their islands. \r\nThat is good news to them and, with the simplicity of \r\nislanders, they think — we think — this will be done \r\nsooner rather than later. This is their hope. Our hope is \r\nin the hands of Member States. I want to believe that \r\nmany of us are here today to give this hope a chance.\r\n10/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nI am encouraged that our ongoing discussions on \r\nclimate change, and the ones that will take place later, \r\nwill usher in a more serious tone and be conducted \r\nmore speedily, and that the matter has captured the \r\ninterest of Member States. We are thankful for that. It \r\ngives us hope, as we look forward to the meeting in \r\nParis. We have set our hopes on Paris as the venue for \r\nthe final stretch of dialogue on how we close the gap of \r\ndisagreement over the level of emissions allowed by our \r\nfriends, the industrialized States Members of the United \r\nNations. We must become more cohesive in our actions \r\nto reach a useful agreement that would help mitigate \r\nthe threat of sinking islands and prevent the potential \r\ngenocide of oceanic peoples and their cultures.\r\nThe next topic I would like to address is that of \r\nhydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). What do the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, the Montreal Protocol and HFCs \r\nhave in common? In 1995, the Congress of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia passed a bill that approved the \r\ncountry’s accession to the Montreal Protocol. In 2009, \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia made the first \r\nproposal for an amendment to the Montreal Protocol \r\nto phase down HFCs, which are powerful greenhouse \r\ngases, as everyone knows. The Federated States of \r\nMicronesia took the lead among developing countries \r\nto promote the phase-down as a complementary climate \r\nchange action. Thanks to island countries, the solidarity \r\nof our African nation friends and the endorsement of \r\nthe European Union, over 100 countries have called \r\nfor these products, HFCs, to be phased down. Now \r\nthe parties to the Protocol are finally converging \r\ntowards an agreement on a mandate to negotiate an \r\nHFC phase-down. The Federated States of Micronesia \r\nwill continue to work with other supporters and with \r\nall parties until an amendment to phase down HFCs is \r\nadopted. I ask the Assembly to join me in this effort.\r\nI note, with great joy, that President Obama is \r\nputting his weight behind this move. This is like \r\nmanna from heaven. Just last week, President Obama \r\nand President Xi agreed on “stepping up their work \r\nto phase down super-polluting” HFCs. With President \r\nObama’s help, we now see that China, India and Brazil \r\nhave indicated their support for the HFC amendment. \r\nNonetheless, their indication of support alone is not \r\nenough. They must do something about that indication. \r\nMay President Obama be blessed many times for his \r\nleadership in this particular area. How true that the \r\njourney of a thousand miles begins with a single step. \r\nThe benevolence of good leaders raises the hope of \r\nislanders that people still care. This is important to the \r\nPacific peoples. They take great comfort in the thought \r\nthat they are no longer alone in their crusade in this \r\narea. I recall that Pope Francis did not forget to remind \r\nus of the golden rule — do unto others as you would \r\nthey do unto you.\r\nOur second strategy on climate change is quite \r\nsimple. We are going to Paris, and we are going \r\nto support the issues that are raised in order to gain \r\nground on the topic of climate-change mitigation. In \r\nMicronesia, we have a challenge called the Micronesian \r\nChallenge. Micronesia is a sprinkling of islands that \r\nspan an ocean area that is larger than the continent of \r\nthe United States and larger than the European Union. \r\nIt is made up of the Republic of the Marshall Islands, \r\nthe Republic of Palau, the territory of Guam, the \r\nCommonwealth of the Northern Marianas and my own \r\nFederated States of Micronesia. These entities have \r\nestablished what is now the Micronesian Challenge. It \r\nis a bold undertaking by small island countries to save \r\nour planet. We are agreeing to set aside 30 per cent of \r\nnear-shore marine areas and 20 per cent of terrestrial \r\nareas as our dedicated contribution to the efforts of the \r\npeople of this Earth to save the planet. We invite those \r\nwho care and can to join us in this effort to contribute \r\nto the well-being of our planet.\r\nWhen in the General Assembly Hall, I cannot help \r\nbut feel a greater sense of security and of empowerment. \r\nIn that regard, I would like to touch on the subject \r\nof peace and freedom — peace as an aftermath of \r\nhostilities, not just of armed conflict, but hostilities of \r\nsilence, tolerance and apathy. When we speak of peace, \r\nyou and I will always remember the absence of it. For \r\nthe people of Micronesia, the first four decades of the \r\npast century will always be remembered as a period of \r\narmed conflict — a conflict in which Micronesians had \r\nno interest and no part. Those of us from Micronesia and \r\nour neighbouring Pacific islands who suffered similarly \r\nhave our deep subscription to peace engraved in our \r\nhearts and inscribed in our governing constitutions. We \r\nbelieve that peace should be universal and embraced by \r\nall of us who have decided to be Members of the United \r\nNations.\r\nWhile we accept that universal peace may be a \r\ndistant goal, it must be sought vigorously and with \r\ndetermined haste. When I speak of the precious issue \r\nof peace, I am often reminded of a statement by a \r\nman whose nation had just come out of war and which \r\nexpressed his dream for lasting peace. President Wilson \r\nsaid of the League of Nations that\r\n15-29658 11/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\n“a general association of nations must be \r\nformed under specific covenants for the purpose \r\nof affording mutual guarantees of political \r\nindependence and territorial integrity to great \r\nand small states alike ... An evident principle runs \r\nthrough the whole program I have outlined. It is the \r\nprinciple of justice to all people and nationalities, \r\nand their right to live on equal terms of liberty and \r\nsafety with one another, whether they be strong or \r\nweak”.\r\nToday, we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations. Some nations celebrate the \r\nanniversary of an end to war. While those of us who call \r\nthe Pacific our home rejoice in the silence of guns, we \r\nare not happy that, elsewhere, innocent people continue \r\nto fear for their lives and lose precious property, and are \r\nforced to confront the ugly face of apathy. Today, many \r\nnations have risen from the debris of war to become \r\ndominant economic Powers in the world. Many have \r\nbeen generous and supportive to those who have been \r\nplundered.\r\nWhile many postwar territories and possessions \r\nhave since attained a negotiated political freedom and \r\nindependence, they still see the shadow of foreign f lags \r\nf luttering over their lands and their affairs. Some are \r\nstill labouring to improve their status as nations, while \r\nothers still await the awakening of the United Nations in \r\nhopes that it will heed their plea for political autonomy \r\nand the honour of f lying a f lag of independence. As \r\nfor our friends who fought against each other in armed \r\nconflicts, we ask them to stand together with us today \r\nand let us resolve to remember war as a painful conflict \r\nof the past. Some things are hard to forget, and the \r\npains of war may be one of them.\r\nFor the sake of a peaceful tomorrow, however, \r\nlet us forgive. Together let us promote friendship, \r\npartnership, and cooperation as our collective strength \r\nfor the future. We have enough common enemies today, \r\nenemies that have no respect for culture, boundaries, \r\nreligion or social status. They are climate change, \r\nsea-level rise, poverty, hunger and famine, illiteracy, \r\nincurable diseases, domestic violence, genocide and \r\nhuman trafficking, economic imbalance and apathy. \r\nThose are our challenges today. We must bind together \r\nour efforts to address them. I ask that we divert the \r\nenergy of our anger over things past to dealing with \r\nthese challenges in order to achieve a better tomorrow. \r\nLet us resolve to work together, more effectively, to \r\novercome these issues, which have been produced by \r\nman’s own doing. Let us take strength and wisdom \r\nfrom our past and apply it for the good of humankind. \r\nLet us forgive, for that is the strength we have as the \r\nUnited Nations. Let us create a spirit of unity to enable \r\nus to find the necessary strength for our united nations \r\nto work well together. Let us celebrate that unity today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident and Head of Government of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Peter M. Christian, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Filip Vujanović, President \r\nof Montenegro\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nMontenegro.\r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Filip \r\nVujanović, President of Montenegro, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vujanović (spoke in Montenegrin; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): This year we \r\nproudly mark a noteworthy anniversary — 70 years \r\nsince the founding of the United Nations, and seven \r\ndecades dedicated to freedom and peace, fundamental \r\nhuman rights, equality between great and small nations \r\nand social progress. That dedication has unquestionably \r\ndemonstrated the value of the United Nations, and \r\nfuture generations must share in that same mission, \r\naimed at achieving a better humankind.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to stress that Montenegro \r\nis strongly committed to preserving all the values the \r\nUnited Nations was founded on. Freedom and peace, \r\nfundamental human rights and social progress are \r\nvalues that all States Members of the United Nations \r\nshould be committed to for the sake of their societies \r\nand the Organization. We therefore believe firmly in \r\nworking to ensure the successful implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1).\r\n12/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, and \r\nthrough its cooperation both within the Council’s \r\nmechanisms and special procedures and with States \r\nand other stakeholders, Montenegro has made a \r\nstrong contribution to enhancing the efficiency and \r\neffectiveness of the Human Rights Council and its \r\nmechanism, the Universal Periodic Review, while \r\nrespecting the principles of universality, impartiality, \r\nnon-selectivity and constructive international dialogue \r\nand cooperation. In our actions at both the national and \r\ninternational levels we have paid particular attention \r\nto, among other things, the issues of preventing \r\ndiscrimination and violence, protecting the rights of \r\nchildren, persons with disabilities and lesbian, gay, \r\nbisexual and transgender persons, empowering women \r\nand girls and protecting freedom of opinion and \r\nexpression. The fact that this year is the twentieth since \r\nthe adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform \r\nfor Action should push us to intensify our efforts to \r\nimplement those important documents in the area of \r\nenabling and empowering women and girls to exercise \r\nall their human rights.\r\nMontenegro strongly supported the adoption of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nis committed to its comprehensive implementation \r\nin order to eradicate poverty and achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment in all its dimensions. Financing is crucial \r\nto achieving the Sustainable Development Goals that \r\nthe Agenda sets out. For that, our main guidelines \r\nare outlined in the final document (resolution 69/313, \r\nannex) of the Addis Ababa Third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development. Mobilizing \r\nall the available resources and including the Agenda \r\nin national development plans are prerequisites for its \r\nsuccessful implementation at the global level.\r\nWe believe firmly that national sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategies, backed by integrated national \r\nfinancial frameworks, must be supported by an enabling \r\ninternational economic environment. It is crucial to \r\nensure that all national stakeholders, including civil \r\nsociety and the private sector, participate in their \r\nadoption and in monitoring their implementation. \r\nBearing in mind that implementing the development \r\nAgenda is an obligation we have to future generations, \r\nI am pleased to be able to point out that in addition to \r\ninstitutional capacity-building, Montenegro has begun \r\nthe process of drafting a new national post-2015 strategy \r\nfor sustainable development, whereby the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals established at the global level \r\nwill be adapted to our national context with a view to \r\nachieving sustainable development within Montenegro.\r\nAction designed to deal with climate change should \r\nbe an integral part of all development policies and \r\nprogrammes. We believe the recent successful high-\r\nlevel meetings in Addis Ababa and New York will \r\nencourage countries to intensify their efforts to achieve \r\na universal and legally binding agreement on climate \r\nchange in Paris at the end of the year.\r\nWe must work together to end conflicts and rebuild \r\npeace. To that end, it is vital that the international \r\ncommunity, acting in accordance with the norms of \r\ninternational law, work to put an end to the violence \r\nin Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, Libya and other areas in crisis. \r\nThe serious human rights violations and intensifying \r\nviolence and crimes committed by terrorist and \r\nextremist groups, such as the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Levant and Boko Haram, are clear evidence \r\nof the seriousness of the threat that terrorism poses to \r\ninternational peace and security. Global engagement is \r\ntherefore the only way to guarantee protection against \r\nit.\r\nWe support global efforts to achieve disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation. We are pleased about the entry \r\ninto force of the Arms Trade Treaty and we urge that \r\nits provisions be effectively implemented. We welcome \r\nthe positive outcome of the negotiations on the Iranian \r\nnuclear programme and the ongoing dialogue between \r\nmembers of the Security Council and Iran with a view \r\nto ensuring that it meets its international obligations \r\nand that a comprehensive and durable solution to the \r\nissue is achieved.\r\nThe current challenges and threats to global peace \r\nand security require a preventive approach to violations \r\nof international law. We support the report of the High-\r\nlevel Independent Panel on Peace Operations on the \r\nfuture activities of peacekeeping missions (A/70/95), \r\nas well as the report of the Advisory Group of Experts \r\non the review of the peacebuilding architecture of \r\nthe United Nations (A/69/968). We believe that their \r\nrecommendations will help to improve the existing \r\narchitecture and its effectiveness. The inclusion of a \r\ngender perspective in all areas of the peace and security \r\nagenda, pursuant to Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000), is of special importance, in particular in the \r\ncontext of the upcoming review of the resolution’s \r\nimplementation 15 years after its adoption.\r\n15-29658 13/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nMontenegro is firmly committed to actively \r\ncontributing to and supporting collective efforts \r\nto maintain international peace and security. The \r\ndeployment of Montenegrin soldiers and police officers \r\nin international missions testifies to our readiness to \r\nfulfil our international obligations and to develop \r\nrelations based on partnership.\r\nMontenegro remains strongly committed to the \r\nconcept of the responsibility to protect, with particular \r\nemphasis on the importance of preventing mass \r\natrocities at the national and regional levels, including \r\nthrough the early-warning mechanism and an early and \r\nbalanced response in cases where the risk of crimes \r\nagainst humanity, war crimes and genocide exists. We \r\nwill continue to demand accountability and punishment \r\nfor all perpetrators.\r\nIn conflict resolution, the use of preventive \r\ndiplomacy, in particular mediation, is necessary. In this \r\nregard, strengthening the capacity of the United Nations \r\nso that it will be able to respond to the growing needs \r\nin this field is imperative. Given that our region is one \r\nof fragile stability, we have learnt from experience that \r\ndialogue and cooperation are the best ways of defusing \r\ntensions, overcoming differences and achieving \r\ndurable solutions. Therefore, Montenegro will, in \r\n2016, organize a meeting under the Mediation in the \r\nMediterranean initiative, as a sign of our commitment \r\nto the further promotion of mediation as an effective \r\nmeans for the prevention and management of conflicts \r\nand peacebuilding.\r\nEnsuring the protection of civilians in conflict \r\nareas and meeting their basic humanitarian needs \r\nare essential. We are committed to supporting the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations humanitarian \r\nassistance architecture, which plays a decisive role in \r\ncoordinating international humanitarian assistance. \r\nTo that end, the organization of the upcoming World \r\nHumanitarian Summit, to be held in May 2016, is \r\nimportant, as it will be an opportunity to consider the \r\nchallenges that the humanitarian sector is facing today.\r\nIn addressing the current migrant crisis, we must be \r\nguided by the shared United Nations values of humanity \r\nand solidarity, and we must take into account migrants’ \r\nneed for assistance. This implies eliminating the causes \r\nof migration and considering the real abilities of each \r\nState to receive migrants and offer related assistance. \r\nAs a country where refugees recently accounted for one \r\nfifth of the population, Montenegro understands the \r\nneed for solidarity with people in great trouble and the \r\nheaviness of the burden of a receiving country.\r\nThe interrelated challenges the world faces \r\nillustrate the need to reform the Organization in order to \r\nproperly position it in the system of global governance. \r\nGuided by this, Montenegro will continue to support \r\nefforts to strengthen the United Nations and improve \r\nthe efficiency, transparency, accountability and \r\nrepresentativeness of the Organization and its agencies. \r\nWe also confirm our commitment to build an effective \r\nmultilateral system in which the United Nations plays \r\na central role. We support the agenda of a coordinated \r\napproach — delivering as one — and are undertaking \r\nactivities aimed at adopting the second integrated \r\nprogramme of cooperation between the United \r\nNations system in Montenegro and the Government of \r\nMontenegro for the period 2017-2021.\r\nFinally, I would like to reiterate that Montenegro \r\nhas been fully committed to the implementation of \r\nUnited Nations values and programmes. As a country \r\nin the last stage of the NATO integration process and \r\nin the successful negotiation process for European \r\nUnion membership, Montenegro has been a good \r\nneighbour and reliable partner in the West Balkan \r\nregion, where the values of cooperation and stability \r\nhave been increasingly affirmed. We are confident that \r\nin these ways, inter alia, we are also contributing to the \r\nachievement of United Nations goals.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of Montenegro for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Filip Vujanović, President of Montenegro, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Manuel Domingos Vicente, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Angola\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Angola.\r\nMr. Manuel Domingos Vicente, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Angola, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\n14/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Manuel Domingos \r\nVicente, Vice-President of the Republic of Angola, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Vicente (Angola) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): At the outset, \r\non behalf of the President of Angola, Mr. José Eduardo \r\ndos Santos, I would like to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly. I also congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, the outgoing President, \r\non the capable manner in which he led the work of \r\nthe Assembly at the sixty-ninth session. In addition, \r\nI commend the Secretary-General for his continued \r\ncommitment to finding solutions to the complex issues \r\nthat trouble the international community.\r\nThe objective of the San Francisco Conference \r\nwas to build a world based on international law and \r\nto seek peaceful solutions to international disputes. \r\nOver the course of 70 years, we have seen progress and \r\nsetbacks. Remarkable progress has been made in the \r\narea of decolonization, which is reflected in the number \r\nof countries that now constitute the United Nations \r\nfamily. However, there has been no success with regard \r\nto collective security, an issue that led to the creation \r\nof the United Nations and that remains at the heart of \r\nits concerns. We must reflect together on the role and \r\nfuture of the United Nations. We need an Organization \r\ncapable of promoting peace and international security, \r\nof acting quickly and effectively in conflict situations, \r\nand of addressing current and emerging challenges.\r\nBy adopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations reaffirmed as absolute priorities the \r\neradication of poverty and hunger, the promotion of \r\nsocial and economic development, the protection of the \r\nrights of all, gender equality, women’s empowerment, \r\nthe environment, access to quality services and special \r\nattention to vulnerable groups.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda reasserts the principle of \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment that it is possible to promote global and \r\nsustainable development and establishes universal \r\nGoals that highlight the need for cooperation among \r\npeoples and a common path for humankind. It calls \r\nfor a global partnership and for commitments from \r\nall parties to mitigating the adverse consequences \r\nof climate change, eradicating poverty and extreme \r\npoverty, and creating opportunities for all. I reiterate \r\nAngola’s commitment to taking appropriate measures \r\nto strengthen theOrganization’s development agenda.\r\nIn the near future, the United Nations will also \r\nbe involved in the review of three very important \r\nprocesses: women and peace and security, peacekeeping \r\noperations and the peacebuilding architecture.\r\nAs I stated before, the ideal that guided the \r\ncreation of the United Nations 70 years ago — to save \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war — has \r\nnot yet been achieved. People around the world expect \r\nthe leaders of the 193 nations represented here to join \r\nin a collective effort to find appropriate solutions to \r\nthe serious and multiple challenges that the people of \r\nthe world face. As we commemorate this anniversary, \r\nwe bear in mind the role and responsibilities of the \r\nUnited Nations as the pre-eminent forum for finding \r\nsolutions to international problems, preserving peace, \r\nstrengthening collective security and renouncing the \r\nuse of force in international relations, respecting the \r\nsovereignty of States, defending and promoting human \r\nrights and reaffirming the rule of law as a fundamental \r\nprinciple of the international system.\r\nThis occasion should provide an additional \r\nincentive to accelerate reforms aimed at revitalizing \r\nthe United Nations system, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil, by extending the number of its permanent and \r\nnon-permanent members, thereby making this body \r\nmore representative and better equipped to address \r\nthe challenges and opportunities that the world faces. \r\nAngola reaffirms the right of the African continent to \r\nbe represented among the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe forced displacement of thousands of human \r\nbeings presents a heartbreaking picture of human \r\ndegradation that offends human dignity. It requires \r\nan immediate and comprehensive response by the \r\ninternational community.\r\nIn the coming month of November, Angola will \r\ncelebrate the fortieth anniversary of its national \r\nindependence in an environment of peace, tolerance \r\nand reconciliation — a direct result of the will of the \r\nAngolan people to work together to achieve higher \r\nlevels of economic growth and greater social inclusion, \r\nprogress and well-being for all in a more democratic, \r\nprosperous and modern country.\r\nDespite the adverse global environment, the \r\nGovernment of Angola remains committed to sustained \r\ngrowth. To that end, it is implementing its national \r\n15-29658 15/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\ndevelopment plan, which aims to rehabilitate and \r\nmodernize economic and social infrastructure, promote \r\npublic and private investment, and improve vocational \r\nand skills training and human resources management.\r\nThe rise in terrorist activities perpetrated by \r\nextremist groups in Africa and elsewhere in the world \r\nis a serious security problem and one that calls for a \r\nglobal coalition to combat this scourge. The creation \r\nof the Multinational Joint Task Force, involving the \r\ncountries of the Lake Chad Basin and Benin, is an \r\nexample of the sort of collective response that deserves \r\nthe support of the international community in order to \r\npurge the African continent of the terrorism that has \r\ncaused such enormous suffering to its people.\r\nThe situation in the Central African Republic \r\nremains a challenge from the point of view of political \r\nand socioeconomic stability and domestic security. \r\nAngola supports the efforts of the transitional \r\nGovernment to restore public order and restructure \r\nState institutions and encourages all the parties to \r\nrespect the commitments made in the Bangui Forum as \r\na fundamental prerequisite for attaining an inclusive, \r\npeaceful and transparent electoral process.\r\nWe welcome the recent compromise reached \r\nbetween the Government of South Sudan and the \r\narmed opposition, mediated by the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development and other international \r\npartners, to resolve the crisis plaguing the country. \r\nWe encourage the parties to the Agreement to honour \r\ntheir commitments and the international community to \r\nmaintain its support for the peace process.\r\nIn Guinea-Bissau, with the institutional crisis now \r\novercome, recent political developments augur well for \r\neconomic growth and political and social stabilization. \r\nWe appeal to all Guinean political and social actors to \r\ndisplay the utmost sense of responsibility, and we urge \r\nthe international community to continue to fulfil the \r\npromises made at the donors’ conference in Brussels.\r\nThe question of Western Sahara continues to \r\nconcern us, in view of the need for the Saharan people \r\nto exercise their right to self-determination. We call \r\non the parties to continue negotiations and to find a \r\nmutually acceptable solution within the framework \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nWe are concerned about the business-as-usual \r\nmindset that prevails in the process of finding a solution \r\nto the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We advocate a \r\nresumption of negotiations leading to a lasting solution, \r\nbased on two States living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nThe conflicts in Libya, Syria and Iraq require fast \r\nresponses, given the serious humanitarian consequences \r\nresulting from them. The causes of these conflicts lie in \r\nthe serious violations of the basic rights of the people \r\nof these countries and in external interference, with \r\nattempted coups or changes of regime and the artificial \r\nimposition of democracy from outside having tragic \r\nand disastrous consequences.\r\nAngola warmly welcomes the agreement concluded \r\nby the six Powers and the European Union with \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran on the Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme. That outcome is evidence that any dispute, \r\nhowever difficult and complex, may have a political \r\nsolution and is particularly notable in the case of a \r\nregion where diplomacy has, in recent decades, been \r\nsystematically passed over.\r\nAngola is closely following the normalization of \r\nthe diplomatic relations between the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba, which is a welcome development. \r\nHowever, Angola emphasizes the need to put an end \r\nto the economic, financial and commercial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, which limits the right of the Cuban \r\npeople to development and is contrary to the principles \r\nand rules of international law.\r\nThe Republic of Angola currently holds the \r\npresidency of the International Conference on the Great \r\nLakes Region and has been engaged in seeking solutions \r\nto the problems affecting the region, both bilaterally \r\nand multilaterally, as well as in the Security Council \r\nand the African Union Peace and Security Council. In \r\nthis context, we reiterate our determination to continue \r\nto support and promote dialogue, peace, security and \r\nstability in Central Africa and throughout the Great \r\nLakes region.\r\nAware of its responsibilities in an international \r\ncontext that is becoming increasingly f luid and \r\ncomplex, and aware of the security challenges that the \r\nStates bordering the Gulf of Guinea face, the Angolan \r\nGovernment, with the support of the United States of \r\nAmerica and Italy, will host an international conference \r\non maritime and energy security in the coming days in \r\nLuanda in order to contribute to a response to threats of \r\nterrorism and piracy in the Gulf of Guinea.\r\nClimate change is one of the greatest challenges \r\nfacing humankind. For this reason, adopting a protocol \r\n16/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nto govern the global action to protect the climate system \r\nat the twenty-first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change is of the highest importance. This \r\nagreement should include a commitment to limiting the \r\nincrease in average global temperatures to 1.5°C by the \r\nend of the century. Likewise, the new agreement must \r\ninclude models of sharing enabling tools to protect \r\nthe right to development and strengthen resilience in \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nFinally, I wish to reaffirm the importance that my \r\ncountry places on the role of multilateralism in solving \r\nglobal problems by finding realistic and bold solutions \r\nthrough concertation, in accordance with a logic of \r\nshared responsibilities and benefits and in fulfilment \r\nof the legitimate interests of all, We call on all Member \r\nStates to renew their confidence in the ability of the \r\nUnited Nations to strengthen international dialogue \r\nas a key element of the culture of peace, respect for \r\ndifferences between peoples and conflict prevention, \r\nwhich are the very foundations of the progress and \r\ndevelopment to which all the peoples of the world are \r\nentitled.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank \r\nthe Vice-President of the Republic of Angola for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Manuel Domingos Vicente, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Angola, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. José Maria Pereira Neves, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Reform of the \r\nRepublic of Cabo Verde\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Reform of the Republic of \r\nCabo Verde.\r\nMr. José Maria Pereira Neves, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Reform of the Republic of Cabo Verde, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. José \r\nMaria Pereira Neves, Prime Minister and Minister of \r\nReform of the Republic of Cabo Verde, and inviting \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Pereira Neves (Cabo Verde) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nI would ask the indulgence of the Assembly that I may \r\ngreet, on behalf of all Cabo Verdeans, all delegations to \r\nthis seventieth session of the General Assembly and add \r\nour voice to all statements made here that call for the \r\nbuilding of a better world. This session provides us with \r\nthe opportunity, as we celebrate the anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations with pride and joy, to engage in a critical \r\nand concrete reflection on the future of humankind and \r\nthe challenges faced by the Organization. The theme \r\nchosen for this session could not be more timely and \r\npressing: “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead for \r\npeace, security and human rights”.\r\nSeven decades after the signing of the San \r\nFrancisco Charter, it is incumbent on us to examine \r\nthe road travelled so far as we identify new actions \r\nthat will allow our Organization to grow in strength, \r\nunity and capacity in order to overcome challenges \r\nto international peace and security and make more \r\nconcrete contributions to a bringing about a more \r\njust, equitable, sustainable and solidary world. Cabo \r\nVerde, which is celebrating the fortieth anniversary \r\nof its national independence this year, is among the \r\ncountries that believe in the fundamental principles \r\nand goals of the United Nations and defend its purposes \r\nand principles, which continue to be fundamental and \r\ncurrent for the Organization’s actions and serve as vital \r\ntools with which to build a common future.\r\nWe underline the crucial importance of reforming \r\nthe United Nations in preparation for the road ahead. We \r\nurge all Member States to negotiate constructively with \r\na view to agreeing on the revitalization of the powers of \r\nthe General Assembly and reaching an understanding \r\non the enlargement of the Security Council, which in \r\nour view should reflect the changes that have occurred \r\nin the world, with a more equitable and appropriate \r\nrepresentation.\r\nIt was with great satisfaction that we participated \r\nin the Sustainable Development Summit 2015, which \r\nbegan this past 25 September. We take this opportunity \r\nto again declare Cabo Verde’s adherence to the \r\nprinciples contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and our full agreement \r\nwith respect to the Sustainable Development Goals. The \r\npoorest and most vulnerable nations legitimately aspire \r\nto development, and we must all commit to achieving \r\nthe goals that have been established for 2030.\r\n15-29658 17/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nSpecifically with respect to the small island \r\ndeveloping States, of which Cabo Verde is an example, \r\nsome essential elements will have to be considered, \r\nnamely, the threat to their survival posed by climate \r\nchange, their particular vulnerability to natural \r\ndisasters, the risk of losing their biodiversity, the reduced \r\nsize of their markets, the high cost of transportation \r\nand energy infrastructure, and their difficulties in \r\naccessing financing. For all these reasons, they deserve \r\nspecial attention from the United Nations system in the \r\ncontext of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is \r\na source of hope for the billions of human beings who \r\naspire to a more just, equitable and inclusive world. \r\nThe will to place people at the centre of development \r\nmeans that we must find appropriate instruments and \r\nconsistent practices in a sustainable environmental \r\nframework.\r\nIn the light of the unequivocal correlation between \r\nsustainable development and climate change, Cabo \r\nVerde, like other small and vulnerable countries, \r\nhopes that the declarations and expressions of intent \r\nwill translate into tangible commitments that lead to \r\nthe reduction of greenhouse-gas emissions but also \r\nprovide a balanced approach to the issues of adaptation \r\nand mitigation. Meanwhile, the new agreement that \r\nis expected to be signed in Paris must not fail to give \r\ndue weight to the issues of loss and compensation, \r\ndevelopment, technology transfer and capacity-\r\nbuilding, and indicate clearly some reliable sources of \r\nfinancial support for the most vulnerable nations. We \r\nare firmly committed to assuming our responsibilities \r\nand making our contributions in that respect. In Cabo \r\nVerde, we have already established the goal of 100 per \r\ncent renewable energy and are on our way to achieving \r\nit, with international cooperation and United Nations \r\nmonitoring. At this time, we have approximately 30 per \r\ncent renewable energy on the grid and believe that we \r\nwill exceed 50 per cent by 2020.\r\nMuch to our consternation, serious cases of human \r\nrights violations are occurring in various parts of the \r\nworld. It is unfortunate that, although almost seventy \r\nyears have elapsed since the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights saw the light of day, the promises made \r\nwhen that basic text was adopted have yet to be fulfilled. \r\nCabo Verde is proud to serve as a benchmark in terms \r\nof freedoms, democracy, the rule of law, respect for and \r\ndefence of human rights, and the promotion of human \r\ndignity.\r\nPeace and security, together with political stability, \r\nare essential foundations for the development and the \r\nwell-being of our peoples. We are therefore growing \r\nincreasingly concerned about the spread of ongoing \r\nconflicts and tensions in Africa and the Middle \r\nEast, which have caused thousands of people to f lee, \r\ndriven by total desperation. In seeking better living \r\nconditions, some find death instead. Those ongoing \r\nevents have exposed the profound economic, social, \r\npolitical, environmental and humanitarian causes and \r\nramifications of the crisis. The global refugee problem \r\nis a great challenge for humankind and requires the \r\nengagement of all. The scourge and stigma of war \r\nnot only affect the well-being of peoples in their own \r\ncountries, but also create broader instability, disrupting \r\nthe development of entire regions. Cabo Verde joins \r\nthose who call for the rapid settlement of the conflicts, \r\nbased on a combination of collective efforts and respect \r\nfor international law and, in particular, the 1951 \r\nConvention relating to the Status of Refugees and its \r\n1967 Protocol.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East continues \r\nto deteriorate, with no end in sight to the various \r\nconflicts that are sweeping the region. The violations \r\nof human rights by the actors in the Syrian conflict, \r\nas well as the atrocities that are being perpetrated in \r\nthe territories under the control of terrorist factions \r\nand religious fundamentalists, are a major cause for \r\nconcern. The United Nations must redouble its efforts \r\nto reach negotiated solutions to that and other conflicts \r\nthat offend our common sense of humanity. Resolving \r\nthe problem of terrorism requires the international \r\ncommunity to step up its actions in combating terrorism \r\nand extremism in all their forms and manifestations. \r\nWe firmly condemn all expressions of terrorism and, in \r\nparticular, the barbaric actions of extremist groups in \r\nthe Middle East, Asia and Africa.\r\nBecause Cabo Verde is an archipelago nation, \r\nthe sea plays a crucial role in the history, identity \r\nand subsistence of the people, providing vital natural \r\nresources and connecting the ten islands that form the \r\narchipelago. As a small island developing State, Cabo \r\nVerde relies on its partnership with the international \r\ncommunity in confronting such maritime security \r\nchallenges as those posed by trafficking and related \r\ncrimes and in preserving and managing our seas.\r\nI would like to draw the Assembly’s attention to an \r\nexemplary action of regional cooperation in September \r\n2014, when seven West African States, including \r\n18/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nCabo Verde, notified the Secretary-General in a joint \r\ncommunication that we wished to extend the outer \r\nlimits of the continental shelf beyond the distance of \r\n200 nautical miles, pursuant to article 76 of the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Last August, \r\nwe had the opportunity to make a technical presentation \r\nto the Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf and expect to receive a favourable response soon.\r\nCabo Verde welcomes the fact that a working \r\ngroup is studying issues relating to the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction with a view to \r\nthe development of a legally binding international \r\nconvention (resolution 66/288, para. 162).\r\nThe world has great and renewed expectations \r\nfor the Organization’s role not only in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, but also in promoting \r\ndevelopment and creating a more prosperous and \r\nunified international society by reducing injustice \r\nand inequities, eradicating poverty, promoting human \r\nrights and combating the effects of climate change. We \r\ndo indeed believe that the United Nations is essential. \r\nA more sustainable world living in peace and security \r\nis possible.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister and Minister of Reform of the Republic \r\nof Cabo Verde for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. José Maria Pereira Neves, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister of Reform of the Republic of Cabo Verde, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Lesotho\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Lesotho.\r\nMr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Lesotho, and inviting him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Mosisili (Lesotho): At the outset, let me \r\ncongratulate the President on his well-deserved \r\nelection to preside over the deliberations of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. His impeccable \r\ncredentials and experience ensure that we will have \r\nsuccess in our deliberations. I also wish to assure him \r\nof my delegation’s full support and cooperation during \r\nhis tenure of office.\r\nWhile turning 70 is an auspicious event in the \r\nlife of an individual, it has added significance and \r\nimportance for an Organization that has presided over \r\nmany of humankind’s trials, failures and successes. \r\nWe recall with pride that many countries in Africa \r\njoyfully attained their independence through the united \r\nefforts of the Organization. That is why we make an \r\nimpassioned plea for the United Nations to now address \r\nthe unfinished business in North Africa and the Middle \r\nEast.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to commend the \r\nprevious President, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nfor his outstanding leadership during the Assembly’s \r\nsixty-ninth session. My delegation truly appreciates \r\nhis tireless devotion to the onerous responsibilities \r\nentrusted to him during the past year. I also thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the lucid report \r\nsubmitted at this session (A/70/1), which provides \r\nvaluable insights into the state of our Organization \r\nand highlights a road map that will steer us into the \r\nfuture. We further recognize and appreciate the tedious \r\nwork that our Secretary-General performs throughout \r\nthe year, dousing f lames of discord wherever they \r\noccur, and applaud him for sharing the joy of our \r\nOrganization’s successes.\r\nThe United Nations was founded on the conviction \r\nthat the nations of the world can and should cooperate \r\nto resolve conflicts peacefully and to change people’s \r\nlives for the better. It established conditions for justice, \r\nrespect for international law and the promotion of \r\nsocioeconomic development in the world. As the United \r\nNations turns 70, our forebears’ abiding conviction must \r\nbe steadfastly reaffirmed and their sense of purpose \r\nreasserted. In that context, we hail the theme chosen \r\nfor the seventieth session, “The United Nations at 70: \r\nthe road ahead for peace, security and human rights”, \r\nas most appropriate.\r\nAs the world’s only truly universal global \r\nOrganization, the United Nations has, over the years, \r\nbecome the most important and relevant forum for \r\naddressing issues that transcend national boundaries. \r\nFor the past 70 years, the Organization has worked \r\ntirelessly to buttress the foundations of global security \r\n15-29658 19/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nand the safety and well-being of the world’s citizenry. \r\nAs a result of the work of the United Nations, in \r\nmany countries corrupt dictatorships have given way \r\nto new democracies, and millions around the world \r\ntoday breathe the fresh air of freedom. Other notable \r\nmoments of distinction in the track record of the \r\nOrganization include its successful conflict-resolution \r\nand peacekeeping initiatives, helping over 17 million \r\nrefugees since 1949 and ensuring that Governments \r\nmeet their responsibilities to the fugitives in accordance \r\nwith United Nations conventions. That notable \r\nachievement notwithstanding, we firmly believe \r\nthat the world should not continue to churn out more \r\nrefugees. An environment must be created to ensure a \r\nculture of religious and political tolerance so as to stop \r\nthe f low of refugees.\r\nAnother milestone in the work of the United \r\nNations is the adoption of an ambitious sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda for the post-2015 period that \r\nepitomizes the Organization’s visionary endeavour to \r\neradicate poverty, address climate change and ensure \r\nthat prosperity is equitably shared. After frank and \r\nconstructive negotiations, a few days ago we adopted \r\nthe consensus outcome document (resolution 70/1). It \r\nmight not be perfect, but it represents the best hope for \r\nfuture prosperity and stability in the world.\r\nLooking at the 17 Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), we draw courage and confidence from the fact \r\nthat the majority resonate so well with the objectives \r\nof the new Coalition Government that I lead. The \r\nCoalition Government leadership has made a very \r\nambitious commitment to ensure that Lesotho emerges \r\nfrom the group of least developed countries by 2025. \r\nThe practical road map under Goal 1 complements \r\nprogrammes already in place in Lesotho. We are \r\nhumbled by the faith in our country shown by the \r\nAfrican Union in nominating His Majesty King Letsie \r\nIII as the Nutrition Champion, a move that will intensify \r\nefforts already under way in my country in the area of \r\nnutrition. On the important issue of energy, Lesotho \r\nrecently launched an innovative energy policy that \r\nwill ensure a substantial increase in renewable energy \r\nproduction, leading to an increase in the provision \r\nof affordable energy to 50 per cent by the end of this \r\nParliament’s term. Those are just a few examples of \r\nthe development programmes Lesotho is committed to \r\nimplementing in the next 10 years that are in line with \r\nthe SDGs just adopted.\r\nOf greater significance is the reform process that \r\nwe have emphasized in the Coalition Agreement signed \r\nafter the February 2015 elections. Lesotho has passed \r\nthrough many political challenges since its return \r\nto democratic rule in 1993, which placed us on the \r\nagenda of the South African Development Community \r\n(SADC) for far too long. Most of those challenges have \r\ntested the resilience and relevance of our Constitution \r\nto the limit. We are now in agreement, together with \r\nour SADC partners, that constitutional reform needs \r\nto be urgently addressed as a first step on the road to \r\npolitical stability. The Commonwealth has also thrown \r\nits weight behind the need for such reforms. We appeal \r\nto this world body to remain seized of that process and \r\noffer the necessary guidance wherever and whenever \r\nthe need arises so that Lesotho’s dignity can be restored \r\nand peace and stability can reign.\r\nDespite the laudable achievements made by the \r\nUnited Nations in shaping the form and content of global \r\ndialogue and negotiations, the world is still an unequal \r\nplace, with large areas beset by intolerable poverty and \r\nhunger. Thousands still die from malnutrition, while \r\nmany people still live below the poverty line. Small arms \r\nand light weapons continue to be illegally traded. Those \r\nweapons are often used in violent terrorist attacks. The \r\nlack of political will to rid the world of nuclear weapons \r\nand other weapons of mass destruction is obvious to all. \r\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty is not yet \r\nuniversal, while the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons regime is at a crossroads, with some \r\nnuclear-capable States refusing to sign on.\r\nWith the ongoing violence in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and \r\nsome parts of Africa, from the Sahel to the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, the capacity of the United \r\nNations to find lasting solutions to these challenges is \r\ntested to the limit. Sadly, the human origin of many of \r\nthese problems cannot be doubted. \r\nAmong the most pressing issues for the international \r\ncommunity today is the problem of refugees and mass \r\nmigration. As a result of war and the carnage that has \r\nexposed the depths of man’s cruelty to man, millions \r\nof people in the Middle East and elsewhere are f leeing \r\nacross international borders on a scale reminiscent \r\nof the Second World War. The numbers crossing the \r\nMediterranean and the Aegean Sea to reach Europe, \r\ndespite the attendant risks, are staggering. The refugee \r\nproblem Europe is facing today will test the limits of \r\nthe continent’s resolve and generosity.\r\n20/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nParallel to the migration crisis is the phenomenon \r\nof terrorism. Terrorism has increased worldwide, and \r\nit has become more brazen and lethal than ever before. \r\nTerrorist networks are expanding across Africa, the \r\nMiddle East and Asia. Even as we remain vigilant \r\nagainst the threat of terrorism, we must move beyond \r\na mindset that this menace can be defeated by force \r\nof arms alone. We may strike blows against terrorist \r\nnetworks, but if we ignore the fact that political \r\ninstability and religious and other forms of intolerance \r\nfuel extremism, our efforts to root out that menace will \r\nbe futile.\r\nClimate change is a major challenge facing the \r\nworld today, and unless it is addressed effectively \r\nit will continue to rewrite the global equation for \r\ndevelopment, peace and prosperity. We should not let \r\nthe window of opportunity represented by the Paris \r\nClimate Change Conference close without collectively \r\ncommitting to action-oriented solutions that can \r\nsignificantly contribute to reducing emissions. The \r\nParis negotiations should be guided by a spirit of \r\nfrankness, mutual understanding and the willingness \r\nto compromise.\r\nThe Doha Development Agenda is important \r\nto developing countries such as mine and deserves \r\nemphasis at every available opportunity. We strongly \r\nbelieve that a well-functioning, rules-based multilateral \r\ntrading system is in our interest. The bilateral \r\narrangements that we are negotiating should follow the \r\npreferences and f lexibilities accorded to World Trade \r\nOrganization member States within the multilateral \r\ntrading system. We therefore make a strong call for the \r\nDoha Development Agenda to be concluded quickly, \r\naccording to its mandate and for it to fully deliver its \r\ndevelopment objectives.\r\nEqually important is the need to acknowledge \r\nthat we will never achieve real development if some \r\nsectors of society continue to be marginalized. The \r\nrole of children and women and other disadvantaged \r\ngroups in our communities in advancing the global \r\ndevelopment agenda must be further enhanced. As \r\nthis year we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe World Programme of Action for Youth, through \r\nwhich the United Nations strengthened its commitment \r\nto improving the lives of young people, let us resolve \r\nto adequately address the development needs and \r\naspirations of young people with more vigour.\r\nMr. Abdrakhmanov (Kazakhstan), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\noffers a unique opportunity to appeal to the Security \r\nCouncil not to use the International Criminal Court to \r\npursue the interests of its powerful members. We must \r\nacknowledge that in its present form and configuration, \r\nthe Council will have an uphill battle to take our \r\nconcerns on board. The call for the Council to be more \r\ntransparent, inclusive and democratic needs to be \r\nechoed with even more vigour and clarity. A reformed \r\nSecurity Council that is in line with twenty-first-\r\ncentury geopolitical realities will be reconstructed in \r\naccordance with the Ezulwini Consensus and Sirte \r\nDeclaration. A Security Council that has the voice of \r\nAfrica and other marginalized regions in the permanent \r\ncategory will increasingly acquire legitimacy and \r\nunconditional acceptance of its decisions.\r\nWe must continue to pursue a joint and consensual \r\napproach in tackling our challenges, taking decisions \r\ncollectively and sharing responsibilities. The General \r\nAssembly, in whose name the United Nations was \r\ncreated, is most suited to fulfil that task. It has \r\ncontinued to serve as the principal policy-making, \r\ndeliberative and most representative organ of the United \r\nNations. It is the only platform on which all countries, \r\nbig and small, can engage in face-to-face negotiations \r\nas sovereign equals to seek solutions to the problems \r\nfacing humankind. The process of revitalizing the \r\nGeneral Assembly must be hastened. The resolutions \r\nof this principal organ of the United Nations should no \r\nlonger be regarded as mere recommendations that can \r\nbe casually ignored. The need for the manifestation of \r\na universal commitment to the principles upon which \r\nthe United Nations is based cannot be overemphasized.\r\nHowever, the United Nations is much more than a \r\npeacekeeper and a forum for conflict resolution. The \r\nUnited Nations and its family of agencies are engaged in \r\na vast array of activities that seek to address challenges \r\nhindering progress in the improvement of people’s \r\nlives around the world. As indicated earlier, today’s \r\nchallenges include, among others, climate change, \r\nfood shortages, HIV/AIDS, financial crises, extreme \r\npoverty, population growth, urbanization, conflicts, \r\nterrorism and mass migration. The common purpose \r\nand most complex task within the United Nations \r\nfamily is finding practical and lasting solutions to all \r\nthese problems.\r\nFor our part, Lesotho has initiated an innovative, \r\nindigenous consultative process that seeks to galvanize \r\nthe collective wisdom and energy of leadership at all \r\n15-29658 21/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nlevels of society, from His Majesty all the way down to \r\nlocal leaders, with the sole purpose of intensifying the \r\nfight against HIV/AIDS. That consultative process will \r\nensure the leadership’s ownership and accountability in \r\nall our health-service delivery processes. We see great \r\nwisdom in redefining the rollout of primary health \r\ncare, utilizing existing community-based leadership \r\nstructures so as to realize the goal of health for all by \r\n2030. That comprehensive rollout agenda has all the \r\ningredients so well articulated in Goal 3 of the SDGs. \r\nHis Majesty is expected to launch the initiative this \r\nmonth.\r\nAs we continue to ponder the most pressing issues \r\nand challenges facing the international community \r\ntoday, we should not forget the plight of the Saharan \r\nand Palestinian peoples. Both the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council have recognized the Saharan \r\npeople’s inalienable right to self-determination and \r\nindependence. We support the call for a resumption \r\nof direct negotiations between the Saharan Arab \r\nDemocratic Republic and the Kingdom of Morocco \r\non an equal footing and without any preconditions. \r\nLesotho also continues to fully support the Palestinian \r\npeople in their decades-long struggle against Israeli \r\noccupation and oppression. Peace between Israel and \r\nPalestine is an essential cornerstone of the architecture \r\nof a comprehensive Middle East peace, a peace that \r\ncan unlock the creative genius and entrepreneurship of \r\nthe region. By the same token, we applaud the current \r\ninitiatives aimed at normalizing relations between \r\nCuba and the United States of America and urge that \r\nthe unilateral sanctions on Cuba be removed sooner \r\nrather than later.\r\nHowever much the world may have changed since \r\n1945, the United Nations remains the only universal \r\nintergovernmental institution that unites us in a global \r\ncommunity of sovereign States. Yes, the Organization \r\nmay have its shortcomings, but it remains a bastion \r\nof hope for humankind. Indeed, the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-seventh session was \r\ncorrect in making the following observation:\r\n“Yet for all its imperfections, which are, after all, \r\ninherent in any institution shaped by the human \r\nmind ... the Organization remains critical to \r\naddressing the growing needs of humankind. One \r\nsimply cannot imagine a world in which peace and \r\nthe dignity of all could f lourish without the United \r\nNations.” (see A/67/PV.1, p. 2)\r\nI could not agree more. The responsibility for making \r\nthe United Nations function optimally rests squarely \r\nwith all of us. Our shared vision and objectives require \r\nmuch more than the reaffirmation of our commitment \r\nto the Organization’s founding principles. Greater \r\npolitical will is an ingredient essential to achieving the \r\nideals that underpin the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWe look forward to a rebirth and an injection of fresh \r\nenergy into the United Nations system, so that its next \r\n70 years can be a period of even greater achievement and \r\nsuccess. We must continue to carry out the obligation \r\nthat its founding Members handed down to us with a \r\nsolemn sense of responsibility on the part of all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Irakli Garibashvili, Prime Minister \r\nof Georgia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Georgia.\r\nMr. Irakli Garibashvili, Prime Minister of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Irakli Garibashvili, \r\nPrime Minister of Georgia, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Garibashvili (Georgia): It is a great honour to \r\nonce again address the General Assembly as we mark \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the founding of the United \r\nNations. The occasion provides us with an opportunity \r\nto reflect on our accomplishments and to recognize the \r\nchallenges that remain in achieving peace, security and \r\nhuman rights at home and abroad.\r\nGeorgia is a small country with a big heart and even \r\nbigger dreams. It is on the move and headed in the right \r\ndirection. Our vision is clear and our future is bright. \r\nIn a major announcement this week, the World Bank \r\nreleased its comprehensive new report on governance, \r\nand I am very proud to say that Georgia was at the top \r\nof the charts in overall progress in all six indicators. \r\nAccording to the rankings, since 2012 Georgia has \r\njumped 13 places in regulatory quality, 16 in voice \r\nand accountability, 19 in the rule of law, 22 in political \r\n22/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nstability and in Government effectiveness, and \r\n23 in controlling corruption. That dramatic progress \r\nunderscores my Government’s determination to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law and media freedom, build \r\na modern economy and move our nation forward with \r\nconfidence.\r\nBy contrast, just two decades ago Georgia was an \r\nisolated country torn by civil war, with few functioning \r\ninstitutions of modern statehood. Today we are writing \r\na new chapter in the history of our great nation. Georgia \r\nis a modern, dynamic and democratic State. Next \r\nyear, we will celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary \r\nof Georgia’s regaining its independence. Freedom, \r\nfairness and justice, as we say, run through the veins \r\nof our people. The Georgian people are committed to \r\nthe rule of law, to the protection of human rights and to \r\ndemocratic values. We will stay the course on reform, \r\nwhich is the only road to peace and prosperity for our \r\ncountry. \r\nWe are moving our country forward in the same \r\nspirit that our ancestors embodied for thousands of \r\nyears. Georgia has absorbed the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, principles that have \r\nguided our democratic development. We learned \r\nquickly and embraced passionately the spirit of \r\ninternational cooperation. So on behalf of all freedom-\r\nloving Georgians, I thank the United Nations and all \r\nfree people around the world for their steadfast support \r\nof my country.\r\nToday, Georgia is firmly connected to the world \r\nand the family of nations. We have dedicated ourselves \r\nto democracy, human rights, sustainable development \r\nand the promise of peace. We are building a mature \r\ndemocracy and a job-creating economy even in the \r\nface of significant regional security threats. The steady \r\narc of our Euro-Atlantic path reflects Georgia’s strong \r\nEuropean identity and values. European integration has \r\nproved to be a powerful incentive for calm cooperation \r\namong European States and their neighbours. We \r\nreached a milestone in June 2014, when I signed the \r\nAssociation Agreement with the European Union. As \r\npart of Europe, Georgia will become part of that fabric \r\nof peace and stability, which can only benefit our own \r\nneighbours, and I think it will make us more secure.\r\nIn the past few years, my Government and our \r\ncountry has made progress in every policy area. \r\nWe have established a social compact that rewards \r\nwork and enterprise while providing a social safety \r\nnet for those in need. Despite challenging economic \r\nheadwinds, we have introduced a national health-\r\ncare programme and doubled welfare services. In just \r\none important initiative, we will save over 200,000 \r\nlives through a new and creative campaign to combat \r\nhepatitis C. We are solidifying Georgia’s democracy. \r\nOur people demand and deserve a strong democracy \r\nand a responsive Government. We have created a system \r\nof governance that is more open, more transparent and \r\nmore accountable to the people than ever before. But we \r\nwill not rest. More must be done.\r\nThe 2013 presidential election and the 2014 local \r\nelections were praised by international observers as \r\nfree and fair. I am also proud of the fact that last year we \r\nadopted Georgia’s first comprehensive long-term human \r\nrights strategy and enacted a new anti-discrimination \r\nlaw. My Government strives to ensure human rights for \r\nall of our people. A free and open democracy goes hand \r\nin hand with a free and open marketplace. \r\nEconomic freedom remains the central pillar of \r\nour development plan. Our plan is designed to grow \r\nour economy, strengthen our institutions of governance \r\nand deliver more jobs and more opportunities for the \r\nGeorgian people. We are driving growth by making \r\nGeorgia a great place to do business and an attractive \r\nlocation for foreign investment. Since 2014, we have \r\nadded 90,000 new jobs in Georgia, covering all sectors, \r\nincluding agriculture, manufacturing, tourism and \r\nenergy. Doing business in Georgia continues to be \r\neasy. Foreign and domestic businesses freely operate \r\nin a competitive environment with strong guarantees \r\nof private-property rights. The World Bank also ranks \r\nGeorgia as the fifteenth easiest place to do business \r\nin the world. In 2014, Georgia achieved an 87 per cent \r\nsurge in foreign direct investment (FDI), which is the \r\nlargest growth in and highest amount of FDI since 2007.\r\nGeorgia has also become a major tourist destination \r\nand venue for international sporting events. The world is \r\ncatching on to the fact that Georgia has it all — beautiful \r\nbeaches and stunning mountain resorts, a gourmet \r\ntradition, exceptional wines, unique historical sites and \r\nworld-class hospitality. In August, Tbilisi hosted two \r\nmajor sporting events, the European Youth Olympic \r\nFestival and the 2015 Union of European Football \r\nAssociations Super Cup, which provided a unique \r\nopportunity to celebrate cooperation over conflict. \r\nSpeaking of sports, I must take this opportunity to wish \r\nthe Georgian national rugby team success as they face \r\nNew Zealand tomorrow at the Rugby World Cup. Our \r\nnation is proud of them.\r\n15-29658 23/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nAnother area of our national development is \r\neducation. I personally know the value of a good \r\neducation and studying abroad. I want Georgian youths \r\nto have that same opportunity. To that end, we launched \r\na new programme where the Georgian Government \r\nwill provide financial support for our students to \r\nstudy abroad. In return, they must come back home \r\nand put their skills to use in service to our country. \r\nFor those hard-working Georgians who cannot travel \r\nabroad, we are bringing world-class education right to \r\nGeorgia. I am proud to say we recently inaugurated a \r\nnew programme in cooperation with the Millennium \r\nChallenge Corporation of the United States. Georgian \r\nstudents can now obtain a United States engineering \r\ndegree from San Diego State University without leaving \r\nGeorgia.\r\nEven with all those achievements, we still face \r\nchallenges to our security at home. I regret that since \r\nmy last address to the United Nations (see A/69/PV.14), \r\nthe Russian Federation signed the so-called integration \r\ntreaties with Sukhumi and Tskhinvali. Russia continues \r\nto illegally extend its control over Georgian sovereign \r\nterritory. I condemn that creeping annexation and \r\nRussia’s disregard for international law. A tragic result \r\nis that the local population in the occupied territories \r\nof Georgia are robbed of the fundamental rights of a \r\nfree people. De facto authorities recently undertook \r\nadditional measures to suppress still further the \r\nGeorgians’ right to be educated in their mother tongue. \r\nThe freedom of movement and the basic rights of a free \r\nnation are crushed, along with the hopes and dreams of \r\nhundreds of thousands of victims of ethnic cleansing \r\nwho only wish to return to their places of origin.\r\nI must once again underline the importance of \r\nresolution 69/286, on the status of internally displaced \r\npersons and refugees from Abkhazia, Georgia, and the \r\nTskhinvali region/South Ossetia, Georgia, and similar \r\nresolutions annually adopted by the General Assembly. \r\nThe pain of the conflict is real. The dislocation is \r\nprofound. Just since 2012, our Government has provided \r\nhomes to approximately 10,000 internally displaced \r\nfamilies from the occupied territories. \r\nAgainst the backdrop of continued Russian \r\noccupation, my Government has nevertheless been \r\nclear on the need to forge responsible and pragmatic \r\nrelations with the Russian Federation. To that end, we \r\nhave taken a number of constructive, concrete steps to \r\nadvance trade, transport, communication, humanitarian \r\ncontacts and tourism when and where possible with \r\nRussia.\r\nLet me be clear. Relations with Russia cannot be \r\nsettled at the expense of our sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity. I hope that the Russian Federation will \r\nfinally fulfil its international obligations, including \r\nthe 12 August 2008 ceasefire agreement, and act as a \r\nresponsible member of the international community. At \r\nthe same time, I want to once again reaffirm our strong \r\ncommitment to the peaceful resolution of the conflict, \r\nbased on the fundamental principles of international \r\nlaw and the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nLet me now address the Abkhazian and Ossetian \r\npeoples, my brothers and sisters. I firmly believe that \r\nno one will rewrite history and erase our common \r\npast. All attempts to cut off ties and divide our peoples \r\nwill fail. We will benefit from a growing Georgian \r\neconomy soon and from our Association Agreement \r\nwith the European Union, including increasing trade \r\nand visa liberalization. We know that the arc of history \r\nfavours more cooperation, more integration and more \r\nprosperity. When we work together, we all succeed and \r\nbenefit. I look forward to the day when we will share in \r\nour mutual prosperity.\r\nDespite those challenges, my country seeks to \r\ncontribute to international peace, security, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and economic prosperity. Last year I \r\nhad the honour of announcing Georgia’s intention to \r\nestablish a Silk Road forum. Today, I am proud that \r\nthe idea has materialized, and in a few weeks we will \r\nhost the first-of-its-kind high-level forum in Tbilisi.\r\nMy country’s location is at a key crossroads linking \r\nEast with West. That was underscored this year when \r\nGeorgia hosted both the annual meeting of the European \r\nBank for Reconstruction and Development and the first \r\nmeeting of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank. \r\nThe revitalization of the Silk Road is an important \r\nopportunity to ensure deeper economic and cultural \r\nties between Asia and Europe. We are developing a \r\nstrong economic and trade relationship with China, \r\nand I think the Silk Road region will open up new \r\nopportunities. That region accounts for two thirds \r\nof the world’s population and 60 per cent of its gross \r\ndomestic product. I am convinced the Tbilisi Silk Road \r\nforum offers great potential to promote cooperation and \r\nregional integration.\r\nI also want to comment on the recent P5+1 \r\nagreement reached with Iran. My country is hopeful \r\n24/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nthat the process will develop in a positive direction \r\nand contribute to greater security and economic \r\ndevelopment in the wider region.\r\nGeorgia has repeatedly demonstrated its readiness \r\nto pay more than its fair share to promote a secure \r\ninternational environment. My country contributed \r\nthe second-largest number of troops, after the United \r\nStates, to the Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan. \r\nOur soldiers are among the world’s best. They are the \r\npride of my nation, and we honour them. I would like \r\nto take a moment to remember all the brave Georgian \r\ntroops who serve their nation and have given their lives \r\nin the pursuit of peace and freedom. My country’s \r\ncontributions to our common security do not end \r\nthere. Georgia also supports the European Union’s \r\npeacekeeping efforts, including providing the second-\r\nlargest troop contribution to the European Union \r\nMilitary Advisory Mission in the Central African \r\nRepublic.\r\nA core element of Georgia’s security and its Euro-\r\nAtlantic integration is its ever-deepening relationship \r\nwith NATO. Following last year’s NATO Summit, \r\nNATO agreed to provide Georgia a substantial package \r\nof practical support to strengthen Georgia’s armed forces \r\nand make us a more integrated ally. Most recently, we \r\ninaugurated a new joint training and evaluation centre \r\nin Georgia, where Georgian forces will receive NATO \r\ntraining. We are also increasing the number of training \r\nexercises carried out between Georgia and the United \r\nStates and between Georgia and its NATO allies.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations, adopted \r\n70 years ago, was designed to put an end to chaos and \r\nto build a better world. Today, the world is still facing \r\nunprecedented challenges that require strong political \r\nresolve. Where necessary, we must reform international \r\norganizations to meet current demands. In that context, \r\nwe commend the ongoing inter-State negotiations \r\non Security Council reform, which aim at raising the \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations in crisis situations, \r\nas defined by the Charter. Increasing the role of small \r\nStates in the Security Council, avoiding misuse of the \r\nveto rights, as well as improving the working methods, \r\nshould be the cornerstone of the reform process. Thus \r\nI express hope that the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations will serve as a reminder to all of us to \r\nstand firmly for the principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and for the goal of peace and \r\nstability throughout the world.\r\nIn conclusion, let me end where I began. Our \r\nvision is clear and our future is bright. Let me share my \r\ndream for Georgia. I see a country where every young \r\nGeorgian boy or girl has access to a quality education \r\nin order to give them the opportunity to develop their \r\nGod-given talents. I see a country where people are free \r\nfrom the fear of not having the health care and resources \r\nthey need to protect their family, livelihood and future. \r\nI see a strong, prosperous Georgia that leverages its \r\ngeographic location as a vital crossroads connecting \r\nEast and West, North and South. I see a strong and \r\nproud nation dedicated to facilitating peace among \r\nneighbours, as well as commerce between continents. \r\nI see a country that is a force for good and stability in \r\nits own neighbourhood, a country that lives up to its \r\nresponsibilities as a global citizen.\r\nLet us walk together in creating a brighter future \r\nfor the next generations. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nGeorgia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Irakli Garibashvili, Prime Minister of Georgia, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Hellenic Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Hellenic \r\nRepublic.\r\nMr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Hellenic \r\nRepublic, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime \r\nMinister of the Hellenic Republic, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Tsipras (Greece): Seventy years have passed \r\nsince the United Nations was founded, after the most \r\ndisastrous war in history. In the wake of that war, the \r\nnoble declarations of the United Nations raised hopes for \r\na common peaceful future, based on universal values, \r\nsocial justice and respect for human rights. Much has \r\nbeen achieved since. But, regrettably, the vision of the \r\nfounders of the Organization is far from being fulfilled. \r\nToday we are witnessing a vast humanitarian crisis, \r\nunprecedented movements of displaced people and an \r\nincrease in poverty, violence, extremism and human \r\n15-29658 25/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nrights abuses. Nevertheless, the big question for us is \r\nnot to identify the challenges we face. The peoples of \r\nthis world know very well what they face every day. \r\nThis great Organization was established to answer the \r\nbig question: how do we deal with those challenges \r\non the basis of our shared values of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations?\r\nUnfortunately, as the years go by, we seem to be \r\nreturning not only to the same problems, but to the \r\nsame old failed recipes that fostered those problems in \r\nthe first place. That is why the biggest challenge we \r\nface today is an existential one: whether to continue \r\nwith the same old recipes of social exclusion, political \r\nfragmentation and economic aggression, or to try to \r\nreclaim our future step by step, with confidence but also \r\nwith the ability to learn from our mistakes. Allow me \r\nto refer to the efforts of my own country in confronting \r\nthree specific crises in the past few years. \r\nLike many other countries, Greece was hit hard \r\nby the 2008 economic crisis, due to the structural \r\nweaknesses of its economy and its high debt and \r\nbudgetary deficits. Yet the neoliberal recipe we and other \r\nEuropean countries were called to implement came at a \r\ndevastating social cost and contributed to deepening the \r\neconomic and fiscal crisis rather than curing it. We lost \r\n25 per cent of our gross domestic product (GDP), our \r\ndebt to GDP ratio grew to 180 per cent, unemployment \r\nreached 27 per cent and the migration of graduates to \r\nEuropean countries accelerated. \r\nWe faced a firm commitment on the part of some \r\nto the idea that Greece must exit the eurozone, or that \r\nthe institutional and structural reforms we need must \r\nbe combined with tough austerity measures and welfare \r\nand wage cuts. After many months of negotiation, \r\nGreece agreed to a new stabilization programme that \r\nincludes reforms in our public administration and in the \r\npension and tax systems and gives us the opportunity to \r\nstabilize our economy by creating the foundation for a \r\nnecessary reprofiling of our debt. \r\nUnfortunately, at the same time, it imposes measures \r\nfurther burdening both society and the economy. Those \r\nmeasures should have been avoided. We needed and \r\nstill need to struggle step by step to claim a growth \r\nagenda rather than an austerity agenda, to protect the \r\nmost vulnerable members of society and distribute \r\ntax burdens justly; and to link the development of the \r\neconomy and the restoration of confidence to the need \r\nto restructure our debt. \r\nHow familiar does that sound to others in the \r\nAssembly? How many times since the 1970s have \r\ncountries in the developed and, more recently, in \r\nthe developing world struggled when facing exactly \r\nthose problems — problems that concern not just \r\ntheir weaknesses, but the recipes they are given to \r\ndeal with them? We have to realize that we need a \r\nglobal financial and economic system oriented to \r\nfostering national growth strategies and our post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. We have to discuss the issue of \r\ndebt restructuring in all competent forums, including \r\nthis one, in connection with developing growth \r\nstrategies, not austerity strategies.\r\nAnother regional European crisis where Greece \r\nis at the forefront is the recent unprecedented \r\nmigration f lows. Since the beginning of the year, more \r\nthan 300,000 people, mostly from Syria, Iraq and \r\nAfghanistan, have entered the country with the goal \r\nof transiting to Western European countries. Greece, \r\nlike all other European countries, was taken aback by \r\nthat development. Nevertheless, the people of Greece \r\nshowed their solidarity by providing food and shelter \r\nto the refugees. In cooperation with the European \r\nUnion and other international organizations, we are \r\ndoing everything we can to manage those f lows in an \r\neffective and humane way, by improving reception \r\nfacilities and identification procedures, as well as by \r\nsetting up hotspots to facilitate relocation. \r\nNevertheless, for some, the only way to deal with \r\nthat challenge is to build walls higher, to repel migrants \r\nby force, or to ensure that they remain someone else’s \r\nresponsibility, as far away as possible. We do not \r\nbelieve that the future of Europe or the future of our \r\nworld can be built with ever-higher walls, or children \r\ndying at our doorstep. Neither can we forget that many \r\nof our ancestors were refugees and migrants. We cannot \r\nallow racism and xenophobia to destroy our common \r\nprinciples. \r\nIn the United Nations framework, we have to build \r\nthe necessary mechanism for resettling people from \r\ncountries neighbouring Syria, while also supporting \r\nthose countries directly in hosting refugees and \r\ndismantling trafficking networks. That resettlement \r\nmechanism, together with the existing relocation \r\nmechanism in Europe, will give hope to those \r\npeople, discouraging them from trusting traffickers. \r\nFurthermore, we have to increase support for frontline \r\nEuropean States, such as Greece, in their effort to \r\nmanage those f lows.\r\n26/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nGreece is also at the centre of a third security crisis, \r\none that causes this refugee crisis. We are at the heart of \r\na triangle of destabilization, with Ukraine to the north \r\nand the conflicts in Libya and in the Middle East to \r\nthe south-west and south-east. Located in that unstable \r\nenvironment, Greece has been striving to bolster \r\nregional security. It supports all efforts promoting peace \r\nand stability. Nevertheless, again we hear some who \r\ninsist that we should embark on unilateral initiatives \r\nwithout considering their prospects and consequences, \r\nor leave the conflicts to be settled by themselves, \r\nwithout contributing to stabilization or reconstruction. \r\nYet those are exactly the mistakes that brought \r\nus here in the first place. We do not have the luxury \r\nto make foreign policy choices without examining in \r\nadvance what their consequences will be. In Syria we \r\nmust act decisively in favour of reconciliation and a \r\npolitical solution that will lay the ground for the Syrian-\r\nled democratic transition, foreseen in the Geneva \r\nCommuniqué. In that regard, we support initiatives \r\naimed at engagement with all relevant international \r\nand regional actors. In Libya, we fully support the \r\nUnited Nations efforts, and we welcome the successful \r\ncompletion of negotiations and political dialogue last \r\nweek. Furthermore, we believe that the Middle East \r\npeace process is of key importance for the region. A \r\nnew momentum for a solution must be promoted, with \r\na view to the creation of a State of Palestine on the \r\nbasis of the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital, that coexists peacefully with Israel.\r\nConcerning Ukraine, we support its territorial \r\nintegrity, independence and sovereignty within its \r\ninternationally recognized borders. We appreciate \r\nthe efforts of the Normandy Contact Group and the \r\nconciliatory role of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe in avoiding a vicious circle \r\nof militarization in the region, And we call on the \r\nsignatories of the Minsk agreements to implement the \r\nagreements in full. \r\nWe are also deeply concerned about the rise of \r\njihadism, which must be dealt with decisively and \r\ncomprehensively. \r\nBeyond the crises I mentioned, Greece attaches \r\nparticular importance to engagement with its \r\nimmediate neighbourhood. There also it is important \r\nto foster new initiatives rather than remain trapped in \r\nthe dead-ends of the past. I spoke of the need to avoid \r\nconstructing walls. And truly it is shameful that for the \r\nlast 41 years — the same number as my age — Cyprus \r\nhas remained divided. Today more than ever, and in \r\nlight of the instability in our region, it is important that \r\nthe momentum be grasped for a mutually acceptable, \r\njust, viable and comprehensive solution to the Cyprus \r\nissue, based on the relevant United Nations resolutions \r\nand on Cyprus’s membership in the European Union, \r\nto the benefit of all the people of Cyprus — Greek and \r\nTurkish Cypriots — as well as all other communities. \r\nIn that context, I would like to underline Greece’s \r\nfull support for the intercommunal talks, held under the \r\nleadership of President Anastasiades and the head of \r\nthe Turkish Cypriot community, Mr. Akıncı. I firmly \r\nbelieve that any real and lasting solution will have to \r\neventually deal with the international issue of security, \r\nthe cancellation of the anachronistic treaties of alliance \r\nand of guarantee and the withdrawal of all foreign \r\ntroops, including the troops occupying the northern \r\npart of this island. \r\nAs a regional player keen on promoting security \r\nin the region, Greece has been making steady efforts \r\nto improve cooperation with Turkey. We have done \r\nso through a wide range of initiatives, including the \r\npromotion of our dialogue on confidence-building \r\nmeasures. Full respect for good-neighbourly relations \r\nand international law by Turkey, as well as a just and \r\nviable solution to the Cyprus issue, remain preconditions \r\nfor the full normalization of Greek-Turkish relations.\r\nIn the Western Balkans, we promote robust bilateral \r\nrelations and a commitment to the region’s European \r\nperspective. Greece has stepped up efforts towards \r\nthe settlement of all differences in the region, among \r\nthem the issue of the name of the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia. We have proposed a pragmatic \r\nsettlement framework aimed at reaching an agreement \r\nand an agreed set of confidence-building measures \r\nthat provide us with an opportunity to further enhance \r\nbilateral cooperation and trust.\r\nPeople all around the globe are striving to achieve \r\na better future for themselves and their children. People \r\nin my country are struggling every day, with pride and \r\ndignity, to overcome crises and regain hope. Even in \r\ntheir most difficult moments, they are assisting those \r\nmore in need, those f leeing conflict zones. Even in \r\ntheir most difficult moments, they are asserting their \r\ndemocratic right to choose their own fate. That is \r\na daily example of people insisting, even under the \r\nmost difficult conditions, on their basic humanity \r\nand democratic rights. That example should guide us \r\nin taking the necessary steps towards a safer, just and \r\n15-29658 27/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nprosperous world for ourselves and future generations \r\nto live in.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nHellenic Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Alexis Tsipras, Prime Minister of the Hellenic \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister \r\nfor Health, and Minister for Communication of the \r\nState of Israel of the State of Israel\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Minister for Health, and Minister for \r\nCommunication of the State of Israel.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Minister for Health, and \r\nMinister for Communication of the State of Israel, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister \r\nfor Health, and Minister for Communication of the State \r\nof Israel, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Netanyahu (Israel): I bring greetings from \r\nJerusalem, the city in which the Jewish people’s hopes \r\nand prayers for peace for all of humanity have echoed \r\nthroughout the ages.\r\nThirty-one years ago, as Israel’s Ambassador to the \r\nUnited Nations, I stood at this rostrum for the first time. \r\nI spoke that day against a draft resolution sponsored by \r\nIran to expel Israel from the United Nations. Then, as \r\nnow, the United Nations was obsessively hostile towards \r\nIsrael, the one true democracy in the Middle East. Then, \r\nas now, some sought to deny the one and only Jewish \r\nState a place among nations. I ended that first speech by \r\nsaying, “Gentlemen, check your fanaticism at the door” \r\n(A/39/PV.32, para. 83). \r\nMore than three decades later, as the Prime \r\nMinister of Israel, I am again privileged to speak from \r\nthis rostrum. And for me, that privilege has always \r\ncome with a moral responsibility to speak the truth. \r\nSo after three days of listening to world leaders praise \r\nthe nuclear deal with Iran, I begin my speech today by \r\nsaying, “Ladies and gentlemen, check your enthusiasm \r\nat the door”. The deal does not make peace more likely. \r\nBy fuelling Iran’s aggressions with billions of dollars in \r\nsanctions relief, it makes war more likely. \r\nJust look at what Iran has done in the past six \r\nmonths alone, since the framework agreement was \r\nannounced in Lausanne. Iran boosted its supply of \r\ndevastating weapons to Syria. Iran sent more soldiers of \r\nits Revolutionary Guard into Syria. Iran sent thousands \r\nof Afghani and Pakistani Shiite fighters to Syria. \r\nIran did all that to prop up Al-Assad’s brutal regime. \r\nIran also shipped tons of weapons and ammunition \r\nto the Houthi rebels in Yemen, including another \r\nshipment just two days ago. Iran threatened to topple \r\nJordan. Iran’s proxy, Hizbullah, smuggled into Lebanon \r\nSA-22 missiles to down our planes and Yakhont cruise \r\nmissiles to sink our ships. Iran supplied Hizbullah \r\nwith precision-guided surface-to-surface missiles and \r\nattack drones so it can accurately hit any target in \r\nIsrael. Iran aided Hamas and Islamic Jihad in building \r\narmed drones in Gaza. Iran also made clear its plans \r\nto open two new terror fronts against Israel, promising \r\nto arm Palestinians in the West Bank and sending its \r\nRevolutionary Guard generals to the Golan Heights, \r\nfrom which its operatives recently fired rockets on \r\nnorthern Israel.\r\nIsrael will continue to respond forcefully to any \r\nattacks against it from Syria. Israel will continue \r\nto act to prevent the transfer of strategic weapons to \r\nHizbullah from and through Syrian territory. Every \r\nfew weeks, Iran and Hizbullah set up new terrorist \r\ncells in cities throughout the world. Three such cells \r\nwere recently uncovered in Kuwait, Jordan and Cyprus. \r\nIn May, security forces in Cyprus raided a Hizbullah \r\nagent’s apartment in the city of Larnaca. There they \r\nfound five tons of ammonium nitrate — roughly the \r\nsame amount of ammonium nitrate used to blow up the \r\nFederal Building in Oklahoma City. And that was just \r\nin one apartment, in one city, in one country. But Iran \r\nis setting up dozens of terrorist cells like that around \r\nthe world. They are setting up those terror cells in this \r\nhemisphere as well. \r\nI repeat, Iran has been doing all of this — everything \r\nthat I have just described — just within the past six \r\nmonths, when it was trying to convince the world to \r\nremove the sanctions. Just imagine what Iran will \r\ndo after those sanctions are lifted. Unleashed and \r\nunmuzzled, Iran will go on the prowl, devouring more \r\nand more prey. In the wake of the nuclear deal, Iran is \r\nspending billions of dollars on weapons and satellites. \r\nDoes anyone here think that Iran is doing that to \r\n28/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nadvance peace? Does anyone here think that hundreds \r\nof billions of dollars in sanctions relief and fat contracts \r\nwill turn that rapacious tiger into a kitten? People who \r\nthink so should think again. \r\nIn 2013, President Rouhani began his so-called \r\ncharm offensive here at the United Nations. Two \r\nyears later, Iran is executing more political prisoners, \r\nescalating its regional aggression and rapidly expanding \r\nits global terror net. They say that actions speak louder \r\nthan words, but, in Iran’s case, their words speak as \r\nloudly as their actions. Just listen to the Deputy \r\nCommander of Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Qods \r\nForce. In February, he said that “the Islamic Revolution \r\nis not limited by geographic borders”. He boasted \r\nthat Afghanistan, Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Palestine and \r\nYemen are among the countries being “conquered by \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran”. He said “conquered”. \r\nFor those here who believe that the deal in Vienna \r\nwill bring about a change in Iran’s policy, listen to what \r\nIran’s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Khamenei, said five \r\ndays after the nuclear deal was reached: “Our policies \r\ntowards the arrogant Government of the United States \r\nwill not change”. The United States, he vowed, will \r\ncontinue to be Iran’s enemy. While giving the mullahs \r\nmore money is likely to fuel more repression inside \r\nIran, it will definitely fuel more aggression outside \r\nIran. \r\nAs the leader of a country defending itself every \r\nday against Iran’s growing aggression, I wish that I \r\ncould take comfort in the claim that this deal blocks \r\nIran’s path to nuclear weapons, but I cannot, because \r\nit does not. This deal does place several constraints \r\non Iran’s nuclear programme, and rightly so, because \r\nthe international community recognizes that Iran is \r\nparticularly dangerous. But, here is the catch. Under \r\nthis deal, if Iran does not change its behaviour — in \r\nfact, even if it becomes more dangerous in the years \r\nto come — the most important constraints will still be \r\nautomatically lifted by year 10 and by year 15. That \r\nwould place a militant Islamic terror regime weeks \r\naway from having the fissile material for an entire \r\narsenal of nuclear bombs. That just does not make any \r\nsense. \r\nI have said that if Iran wants to be treated like a \r\nnormal country, let it act like a normal country. This \r\ndeal will treat Iran like a normal country even if it \r\nremains a dark theocracy that conquers its neighbours, \r\nsponsors terrorism worldwide and chants, “Death \r\nto Israel, death to America!” Does anyone seriously \r\nbelieve that f looding a radical theocracy with weapons \r\nand cash will curb its appetite for aggression? Does \r\nanyone here really believe that a theocratic Iran with \r\nsharper claws and sharper fangs will be more likely to \r\nchange its stripes? There is a general rule that I have \r\nlearned — and that that those here must have learned it \r\nin their lifetime — which is that when bad behaviour is \r\nrewarded, it only gets worse.\r\nI have long said that the greatest danger that the \r\nworld faces is the coupling of militant Islam with nuclear \r\nweapons. I am gravely concerned that the nuclear deal \r\nwith Iran will prove to be the marriage certificate of \r\nthat unholy union. I know that some well-intentioned \r\npeople sincerely believe that this deal is the best way to \r\nblock Iran’s path to the bomb. However, one of history’s \r\nmost important, yet least learned lessons, is that the \r\nbest intentions do not prevent the worst outcomes. The \r\nvast majority of Israelis believe that this nuclear deal \r\nwith Iran is a very bad deal. What makes matters even \r\nworse is that we see the world celebrating this bad deal, \r\nrushing to embrace and do business with a regime that \r\nis openly committed to our destruction. \r\nLast week, Major General Salehi, the Commander \r\nof Iran’s Army, proclaimed \r\n“We will annihilate Israel, for sure. We are glad that \r\nwe are in the forefront of executing the Supreme \r\nLeader’s order to destroy Israel.” \r\nAs for the Supreme Leader himself, a few days after the \r\nnuclear deal was announced, he released his latest book. \r\nIt is a 400-page screed detailing his plan to destroy the \r\nState of Israel. Last month, Khamenei once again made \r\nhis genocidal intentions clear. Before Iran’s top clerical \r\nbody, the Assembly of Experts, he spoke about Israel, \r\nwhich is home to over 6 million Jews. He pledged that \r\n“there will be no Israel in 25 years”. Seventy years after \r\nthe murder of 6 million Jews, Iran’s rulers promise to \r\ndestroy my country, murder my people, and the response \r\nfrom this body, the response from nearly every one of \r\nthe Governments represented here, has been absolutely \r\nnothing — utter silence, deafening silence.\r\nPerhaps members of the Assembly can now \r\nunderstand why Israel is not joining in the general \r\ncelebration of the deal. If Iran’s rulers were working \r\nto destroy other members’ countries, perhaps they \r\nwould be less enthusiastic about the deal. If Iran’s \r\nterror proxies were firing thousands of rockets at other \r\nmembers’ cities, perhaps they would be more measured \r\nin their praise. And if the deal were unleashing a nuclear \r\n15-29658 29/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\narms race in their neighbourhoods, perhaps they would \r\nbe more reluctant to celebrate.\r\nBut no one should think that Iran is a danger only \r\nto Israel. Besides Iran’s aggression in the Middle East \r\nand its terror campaign around the world, Iran is also \r\nbuilding intercontinental ballistic missiles whose sole \r\npurpose is to carry nuclear warheads. Now this fact \r\nneeds to be remembered: Iran already has missiles \r\nthat can reach Israel. So those intercontinental ballistic \r\nmissiles that Iran is building are not meant for us. They \r\nare meant for others — for Europe, for America, for \r\nraining down mass destruction anytime, anywhere.\r\nIt is not easy to oppose something that is embraced \r\nby the greatest Powers in the world. Believe me, it \r\nwould be far easier to remain silent. But throughout our \r\nhistory, the Jewish people have learned the heavy price \r\nof silence. And as the Prime Minister of the Jewish \r\nState, as someone who knows that history, I refuse to \r\nbe silent. I will say it again. The days when the Jewish \r\npeople remained passive in the face of genocidal \r\nenemies — those days are over. Not being passive means \r\nspeaking up about those dangers. We have spoken up, \r\nwe are speaking up, and we will continue to do so. Not \r\nbeing passive also means defending ourselves against \r\nthose dangers. We have. We are. And we will.\r\nIsrael will not allow Iran to break in, to sneak in \r\nor to walk into the nuclear-weapons club. I know that \r\npreventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons \r\nremains the official policy of the international \r\ncommunity. But no one should question Israel’s \r\ndetermination to defend itself against those who seek \r\nour destruction. For in every generation, there have been \r\nthose who sought to destroy our people. In antiquity, we \r\nfaced destruction from the ancient empires of Babylon \r\nand Rome. In the Middle Ages, we faced inquisitions \r\nand expulsions. And in modern times, we faced pogroms \r\nand the Holocaust. Yet the Jewish people persevered.\r\nAnd now another regime has arisen, swearing to \r\ndestroy Israel. That regime would be wise to consider \r\nthis fact: I stand here today representing Israel, a \r\ncountry that is 67 years young but is the nation State \r\nof a people nearly 4,000 years old. The empires of \r\nBabylon and Rome are not represented in this Hall of \r\nnations, nor is the 1,000-year Reich. Those seemingly \r\ninvincible empires are long gone. But Israel lives. The \r\npeople of Israel live. \r\nThe rebirth of Israel is a testament to the indomitable \r\nspirit of my people. For a hundred generations, the \r\nJewish people dreamed of returning to the land of \r\nIsrael. Even in our darkest hours — and we had so \r\nmany — even in our darkest hours, we never gave up \r\nhope of rebuilding our eternal capital, Jerusalem. The \r\nestablishment of Israel made it possible to realize that \r\ndream. It has enabled us to live as a free people in our \r\nancestral homeland. It has enabled us to embrace Jews \r\nwho have come from the four corners of the Earth to \r\nfind refuge from persecution. They have come from \r\nwar-torn Europe, from Yemen, Iraq, and Morocco, from \r\nEthiopia and the Soviet Union, from a hundred other \r\nlands. And today, as a rising tide of anti-Semitism once \r\nagain sweeps across Europe and elsewhere, many Jews \r\ncome to Israel to join us in building the Jewish future.\r\nSo here is my message to the rulers of Iran. Their \r\nplan to destroy Israel will fail. Israel will not permit \r\nany force on Earth to threaten its future. And here is my \r\nmessage to all the countries represented here. Whatever \r\nresolutions they may adopt in this building, whatever \r\ndecisions they may take in their capitals, Israel will do \r\nwhatever it must do to defend our State and to defend \r\nour people.\r\nAs the deal with Iran moves ahead, I hope it will \r\nbe enforced — how can I put this? — with a little more \r\nrigour than was shown with the six Security Council \r\nresolutions that Iran has systematically violated and \r\nwhich now have been effectively discarded. I would \r\ncall for ensuring that the inspectors actually inspect, \r\nthat the snapback sanctions actually snap back, and that \r\nIran’s violations not be swept under the Persian rug. \r\nThere is one thing I can assure the Assembly of today \r\nthat Israel will be watching closely.\r\nWhat the international community now needs to \r\ndo is clear: first, it must make Iran comply with all \r\nits nuclear obligations, and hold Iran’s feet to the fire. \r\nSecondly, Iran’s regional aggression must be put in \r\ncheck by supporting and strengthening those fighting \r\nIran’s aggression, beginning with Israel. Thirdly, use \r\nsanctions and all the tools available to tear down Iran’s \r\nglobal terror network.\r\nIsrael is working closely with our Arab peace \r\npartners to address our common security challenges \r\nfrom Iran and also the security challenges from the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and from \r\nothers. We are also working with other States in the \r\nMiddle East, as well as with countries in Africa, in \r\nAsia and beyond. Many in our region know that both \r\nIran and ISIL are our common enemies. And when \r\n30/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\none’s enemies fight each other, one does not strengthen \r\neither one. One weakens both. \r\nCommon dangers are clearly bringing Israel and its \r\nArab neighbours closer. As we work together to thwart \r\nthe dangers that I have mentioned, I hope that we will \r\nbuild lasting partnerships for security, for prosperity \r\nand for peace. But in Israel, we never forget one thing. \r\nWe never forget that Israel’s most important partner has \r\nalways been, and will always be, the United States of \r\nAmerica. The alliance between Israel and the United \r\nStates is unshakeable.\r\nPresident Obama and I agree on the need to keep \r\narms out of the hands of Iran’s terror proxies. We agree \r\non the need to stop Iran from destabilizing countries \r\nthroughout the Middle East. Israel deeply appreciates \r\nPresident Obama’s willingness to bolster our security \r\nand to help Israel maintain its qualitative military edge \r\nin order to confront the enormous challenges we face. \r\nIsrael is grateful that this sentiment is widely shared \r\nby the American people and its representatives in \r\nCongress — both by those who supported the deal and \r\nby those who opposed it.\r\nPresident Obama and I have both said that our \r\ndifferences over the nuclear deal are a disagreement \r\nwithin the family. But we have no disagreement about \r\nthe need to work together to secure our common \r\nfuture. And what a great future it could be. Israel is \r\nuniquely poised to take advantage of the promise of the \r\ntwenty-first century. Israel is a world leader in science \r\nand technology, in cybertechnology, software, water, \r\nagriculture, medicine, biotechnology and so many other \r\nfields that are being revolutionized by Israeli ingenuity \r\nand Israeli innovation. Israel is the innovation nation. \r\nIsraeli know-how is everywhere. It is in our computers’ \r\nmicroprocessors and f lash drives. It is in our smart \r\nphones, when we send instant messages and navigate \r\nour cars. It is on our farms, when we drip-irrigate our \r\ncrops and keep our grains and produce fresh. It is in \r\nour universities, when we study Nobel Prize-winning \r\ndiscoveries in chemistry and economics. It is in \r\nour medicine cabinets, when we use drugs to treat \r\nParkinson’s disease and multiple sclerosis. It is even \r\non our plates, when we eat delicious cherry tomatoes. \r\nThey were also perfected in Israel, in case someone did \r\nnot know.\r\nWe are so proud in Israel of the long strides that \r\nour country has been able to take in a short time. We \r\nare so proud that our small country is making such a \r\nhuge contribution to the entire world. Yet the dreams of \r\nour people, enshrined for eternity by the great prophets \r\nof the Bible, will be fully realized only when there is \r\npeace. \r\nAs the Middle East descends into chaos, Israel’s \r\npeace agreements with Egypt and Jordan are two \r\ncornerstones of stability. Israel remains committed to \r\nachieving peace with the Palestinians as well. Israelis \r\nknow the price of war. I know the price of war. I was \r\nnearly killed in battle. I lost many friends. I lost my \r\nbeloved brother Yoni. Those who know the price of \r\nwar can best appreciate what the blessings of peace \r\nwould mean — for ourselves, our children and our \r\ngrandchildren. I am prepared to immediately resume \r\ndirect peace negotiations with the Palestinian Authority \r\nwithout any preconditions whatsoever. Unfortunately, \r\nPresident Abbas said yesterday that he is not prepared \r\nto do that. I hope he changes his mind, because I remain \r\ncommitted to a vision of two States for two peoples, in \r\nwhich a demilitarized Palestinian State recognizes the \r\nJewish State.\r\nAs members know, the peace process began over \r\ntwo decades ago. Yet despite the best efforts of six \r\nIsraeli prime ministers — Rabin, Peres, Barak, Sharon, \r\nOlmert and myself — the Palestinians have consistently \r\nrefused to end the conflict and to make a final peace \r\nwith Israel. Unfortunately, we heard that rejectionism \r\nagain only yesterday from President Abbas. How can \r\nIsrael make peace with a Palestinian partner who \r\nrefuses to even sit at the negotiating table? Israel expects \r\nthe Palestinian Authority to abide by its commitments. \r\nThe Palestinians should not walk away from peace. I \r\nwould like to tell President Abbas that I know it is not \r\neasy. I know it is hard. But we owe it to our peoples to \r\ntry, to continue to try. If we actually sit down together, \r\nif we actually negotiate and stop negotiating about the \r\nnegotiation, and if we actually sit down to try to resolve \r\nthe conflict between us, recognizing each other and \r\nnot using a Palestinian State as a stepping stone for yet \r\nanother Islamist dictatorship in the Middle East but \r\nas something that will live at peace next to the Jewish \r\nState, we can do remarkable things for our peoples.\r\nThe United Nations can help advance peace by \r\nsupporting direct, unconditional negotiations between \r\nthe parties. The United Nations will certainly not \r\nhelp advance peace by trying to impose solutions \r\nor by encouraging Palestinian rejectionism, And \r\nthe United Nations should do one more thing. The \r\nUnited Nations should finally rid itself of its obsessive \r\nbashing of Israel. Here is just one absurd example of \r\n15-29658 31/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nthat obsession. In the four years of horrific violence in \r\nSyria, more than a quarter of a million people have lost \r\ntheir lives. That is more than 10 times the number of \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians combined who have lost their \r\nlives in a century of conflict between us. Yet last year, \r\nthe Assembly adopted 20 resolutions against Israel and \r\nonly one resolution about the savage slaughter in Syria. \r\nTalk about injustice. Talk about disproportionality. \r\nCount them: 20. And one against Syria. Well, frankly I \r\nam not surprised. To borrow a line from Yogi Berra, the \r\nlate, great baseball player and part-time philosopher, \r\nwhen it comes to the annual bashing of Israel at the \r\nUnited Nations, it is déjà vu all over again.\r\nEnough is enough. Today, 31 years after I stood \r\nhere for the first time, I am still asking when the United \r\nNations will finally check its anti-Israel fanaticism at \r\nthe door, when the United Nations will finally stop \r\nslandering Israel as a threat to peace and when it will \r\nactually start helping Israel advance peace. The same \r\nquestion should be posed to Palestinian leaders. When \r\nwill they start working with Israel to advance peace and \r\nreconciliation, stop libelling Israel and stop inciting \r\nhatred and violence?\r\nHere is a good place for President Abbas to \r\nbegin. He should stop spreading lies about Israel’s \r\nalleged intentions on the Temple Mount. Israel is fully \r\ncommitted to maintaining the status quo there. What \r\nPresident Abbas should be speaking out against are \r\nthe actions of the militant Islamists who are smuggling \r\nexplosives into the Al-Aqsa Mosque and who are trying \r\nto prevent Jews and Christians from visiting the holy \r\nsites. That is the real threat to those sacred sites.\r\nA thousand years before the birth of Christianity, \r\nmore than 1,500 years before the birth of Islam, King \r\nDavid made Jerusalem our capital, and King Solomon \r\nbuilt the Temple on that Mount. Yet Israel will always \r\nrespect the sacred shrines of all religions. In a region \r\nplagued by violence and by unimaginable intolerance, \r\nin which Islamic fanatics are destroying the ancient \r\ntreasures of civilization, Israel stands out as a towering \r\nbeacon of enlightenment and tolerance. Far from \r\nendangering the holy sites, Israel ensures their safety. \r\nBecause, unlike the Powers that ruled Jerusalem in the \r\npast, Israel respects the holy sites and the freedom of \r\nworship of Jews, Muslims, Christians — everyone. And \r\nthat will never change.\r\nBecause Israel will always stay true to its values. \r\nThose values are on display each and every day. \r\nThey are on display when Israel’s feisty parliament \r\nvigorously debates every issue under the sun; when \r\nIsrael’s Chief Justice sits in her chair at our fiercely \r\nindependent Supreme Court; when our Christian \r\ncommunity continues to grow and thrive from year \r\nto year, whereas Christian communities elsewhere in \r\nthe Middle East are decimated; when a brilliant young \r\nIsraeli Muslim student gives her valedictorian address \r\nat one of our finest universities; and when Israeli \r\ndoctors and nurses — doctors and nurses from the \r\nIsraeli military — treat thousands of wounded from the \r\nkilling fields of Syria and thousands more in the wake \r\nof natural disasters from Haiti to Nepal. That is the true \r\nface of Israel. Those are the values of Israel.\r\nIn the Middle East, those values are under savage \r\nassault by militant Islamists, who are forcing millions \r\nof terrified people to f lee to distant shores. Just 10 \r\nmiles from ISIS and a few hundred yards from Iran’s \r\nmurderous proxies, Israel stands in the breach, proudly \r\nand courageously defending freedom and progress. \r\nIsrael is civilization’s front line in the battle against \r\nbarbarism. So here is a novel idea for the United \r\nNations. Instead of continuing the shameful routine \r\nof bashing Israel, the international community should \r\nstand with Israel. The international community should \r\nstand with Israel as we work to check the fanaticism \r\nat its doors. It should stand with Israel as we prevent \r\nthat fanaticism from even reaching its doors. The \r\ninternational community should stand with Israel \r\nbecause Israel is not just defending itself. More than \r\never, Israel is defending the world!\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji \r\nAbdul Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Malaysia. \r\nDato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, \r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Dato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin \r\nTun Haji Abdul Razak, Prime Minister of Malaysia, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\n32/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nMr. Razak (Malaysia): I would like to congratulate \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session. His \r\nexperience and wisdom will be an invaluable guide to \r\nthe Assembly. The theme of this session, “The United \r\nNations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security and \r\nhuman rights”, is timely. We urgently need to find new \r\napproaches and to rise above the political divisions and \r\nput people first in an age when the old ways are proving \r\ninadequate to the challenges we face today.\r\nWe are a world of nation States, but the new \r\nconflicts and threats that imperil our peace and security \r\ndo not recognize borders. Non-State actors, such as the \r\nso-called Islamic State, threaten to destroy sovereign \r\nStates. They do not confine their acts of horrific cruelty \r\nwithin official boundaries. Experts in social media \r\nrecruit followers in faraway countries, luring them with \r\nfalse promises and persuading many young people that \r\ntheir barbaric actions will bring them closer to God. \r\nThat is sickening, and there can be no greater a slur \r\non Islam, which is a religion of peace, moderation and \r\njustice.\r\nBut those extremists cannot be defeated by \r\ntraditional military means alone. Five years ago, I \r\nstood before the Assembly and called for a global \r\nmovement of moderates, a movement of all religions, of \r\nall countries, to marginalize extremists, to reclaim the \r\ncentre and reshape the agenda in the direction of peace \r\nand pragmatism. We in Malaysia have followed up, both \r\nthrough practical action and by building intellectual \r\ncapacity. Central to that effort is a reaffirmation of \r\nIslam’s true nature, because we must acknowledge that, \r\nat the moment, we are not winning the propaganda war \r\nagainst the so-called Islamic State. Its twisted narrative \r\nis not being countered in a way adequate to preventing \r\nmany misguided people from joining or supporting it \r\nfrom afar. So it is more important than ever that we \r\nspread awareness about authentic Islam, most especially \r\nwhen conflicts persist and people lose hope. For it is \r\nthere that extremism finds fertile soil. And those who \r\nfight for extremism, for a perversion of true Islam, are \r\namong the main drivers of the current migration crisis \r\nin the Middle East.\r\nIslam unequivocally prohibits the killing of \r\ncivilians during war. It explicitly protects minorities \r\nand respects those of other faiths. It urges the \r\npursuit of knowledge and stresses both justice and \r\ncompassion. As the Prophet Muhammad said, you will \r\nnot enter paradise until you have faith, and you will \r\nnot complete your faith until you love one another as \r\nyou love yourselves. That means that there should be \r\nno strife among Muslims, including between Shia and \r\nSunni, who may take different paths but seek the same \r\ndestination.\r\nIslam condemns the destruction of historical sites \r\nthat are part of the world’s cultural heritage. The lies \r\nof the so-called Islamic State include the claim that \r\nit is their duty to destroy historical sites, because the \r\nProphet Muhammad destroyed the idols that had been \r\nintroduced into the Kaaba in Mecca. That reasoning \r\nis based on a false analogy. The Kaaba was built by \r\nthe prophet Abraham for the worship of the one true \r\nGod, and later generations added the idols. The Prophet \r\nMuhammad was commanded to purify the Kaaba of \r\nthose idols for its use by his followers and to bring it \r\nback to its original form. The historical sites being \r\ndestroyed by the so-called Islamic State were never \r\nused for the worship of the one God and then later \r\ndesecrated, so the argument for destroying them does \r\nnot and cannot apply. Moreover, God informs us that the \r\nsites that we travel to and that denote past civilizations, \r\nsome of which were global super-Powers in their time \r\nbut are that no longer, are signs that remind us not to be \r\narrogant, but to walk the earth humbly. We must combat \r\nthe so-called Islamic State and its warped ideology by \r\nexplaining why their path is un-Islamic and why their \r\nactions are evil, theologically incoherent and a travesty \r\nof Islam, which commands us to be knowledgeable, \r\ncompassionate and humble.\r\nThe Malaysian Government has helped to develop \r\nan important body of scholarship that does just that. \r\nAn international group of Sunni and Shia scholars \r\nrepresenting a cross-section of the global Muslim \r\ncommunity has been convened in Kuala Lumpur. Its \r\nmission is to define an Islamic State, based on the \r\ncontinuity of Islamic religious thought through the past \r\n14 centuries. Such a State is nothing like the entity in \r\nSyria and Iraq that usurps that name. The scholars have \r\nunanimously emphasized that an Islamic State must \r\ndeliver justice in all its forms, political, economic and \r\nin the courts, to its citizens. It must be based on the \r\nobjectives of sharia, or maqasid sharia, which are the \r\nprotection and enhancement of life, religion, intellect, \r\nproperty, family and dignity.\r\nAn Islamic State must defend the various peoples \r\nunder its rule and preserve their religions, languages \r\nand historic sites, because God commands us, “Indeed, \r\nwe have made you nations and tribes, that ye may \r\n15-29658 33/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nknow one another”. God could have created us as one \r\nreligious community, but in order to test us, He did not \r\ndo so, and He orders us to compete with each other in \r\nbeing virtuous. A true Islamic State, therefore, aids \r\nGod’s divine intent to test humankind and urges us to \r\ncompete in virtue, in knowledge, kindness, compassion \r\nand humility, but, crucially, it does not coerce us to \r\ndo so. Those are Islam’s true principles. The so-called \r\nIslamic State knows nothing of Islam’s noble ideals, \r\ncompassion or solemn duty to care for and learn about \r\nour fellow human beings. They are violating divine \r\nwill. They are desecrating the name of our religion \r\nthrough their self-proclaimed caliphate, to which no \r\ntrue Muslim will pledge allegiance. That is the message \r\nthat we must spread to Muslims and non-Muslims. And \r\nI call on the Umma to rise with one voice and let the \r\nworld ring when we say to the so-called Islamic State \r\nthat it does not represent us.\r\nLet no one doubt how seriously Malaysia regards \r\nthe problem of militants, both those who wish to use \r\nKuala Lumpur as a transit point and those who wish \r\nto sow violence and destruction at home. Much of our \r\nwork on that problem cannot be revealed for security \r\nreasons. Some may be led to think that, because \r\nMalaysia has not suffered a successful terrorist attack, \r\nwe do not have national security challenges. That is not \r\nthe case. Our tireless and ever-vigilant security forces \r\nhave intercepted many would-be IS recruits transiting \r\nthrough Kuala Lumpur. It is because of our efforts that \r\nthose recruits have not fallen into the darkness that \r\nblights Syria and Iraq. But, unfortunately, some have. \r\nWe have identified 39 Malaysians who have travelled to \r\njoin the so-called Islamic State, and we have arrested \r\nmore than 100 of our citizens suspected of links to the \r\nso-called Islamic State.\r\nThose threats are real. There are people who want to \r\nbring terror to our streets. We will not stand for it, and \r\nthey will not succeed, for Malaysia has been and will \r\nalways be a land where many faiths and ethnicities freely \r\nprosper and thrive. But we must strive harder to combat \r\nthe terrorist threat together. Military and intelligence \r\nservices need to share information and countries need \r\nto collaborate more and dare to pre-emptively arrest as \r\nnecessary. We have passed legislation to enable that. \r\nWhen the evidence is irrefutable, we will take action \r\nunhesitatingly. If our citizens’ lives are threatened by \r\nthe possible bombing of a mall or a railway station, we \r\nwould be negligent in our duty if we did not intervene \r\nbefore it was too late.\r\nThe year 2015 has given us examples of inspiring \r\nnew approaches. For instance, the United States restored \r\ndiplomatic relations with Cuba. That was a historic \r\nachievement and an exemplary display of moderation \r\nin action. It took courage. It would not have happened \r\nhad those wishing to cling to old political divisions \r\nheld sway. Forward-thinking leaders put their people’s \r\ninterests first. \r\nSimilar courage is needed to permanently address \r\nthe injustice that the Palestinians have suffered \r\nsince 1948. Decades of impunity and the systematic \r\ndehumanization of Palestinians has culminated in \r\nincreasing violence, illegal settlements and violations \r\nof rights. The frustration and anger felt by the \r\nPalestinians resonates with Muslims worldwide. If the \r\nworld continues to turn a blind eye to their suffering, \r\nwe risk another catastrophe in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory. We will also fail to uphold the right to self-\r\ndetermination, which was one of the founding principles \r\nof the United Nations when it was created 70 years ago.\r\nOn that note, given the violations of the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque that took place on Rosh Hashanah in Jerusalem \r\nthis year and the aggression against its worshippers three \r\nweeks ago, I call on the Israeli Government to live up to \r\nJudaism’s highest ethical principles and, in particular, \r\nto the essential message of the Torah, as succinctly \r\nexpressed by the sage Hillel of the first century before \r\nthe Common Era. When asked to describe the Torah in \r\na nutshell, he said, “That which is despicable to you, do \r\nnot do to your fellow”.\r\nThat dictum, known universally in all religions \r\nas the Golden Rule, could herald the dawn of a much \r\nneeded revitalized relationship between Muslims and \r\nJews. Currently Israel is exerting its authority over \r\nIslam’s third holiest site, in defiance of the jurisdiction \r\nof King Abdullah of Jordan, its lawful custodian. It is, \r\ntherefore, Israel’s duty to facilitate the visits of Muslims \r\nfrom all over the world. For that is an aspiration held \r\nby all devout Muslims that they pray to realize in their \r\nlifetime.\r\nPutting people first will not always be easy, but the \r\nproblems of today require new and global solutions. \r\nAs a member of the Security Council, Malaysia will \r\ncontinue to raise such issues. Reforming the Security \r\nCouncil so as better to reflect the realities of 2015, rather \r\nthan those of 1945, represents a good start in building \r\na new and adequately responsive global architecture.\r\n34/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nWe in Malaysia know how much that is needed. We \r\nwere extremely disappointed that the proposed Council \r\nresolution to set up an international tribunal on the \r\nmatter of the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines Flight \r\nMH-17 was not adopted because the right of veto was \r\nused. We will continue to seek justice through other \r\nlegal options, because we owe it to the families of those \r\nwho perished in that outrageous crime.\r\nBut whether it be reforming the United Nations, \r\ncombating extremism or dealing with migration, greater \r\nmutual effort is necessary. We must look into ourselves \r\nand our own traditions to create new mechanisms. \r\nWe believe that moderation is key. Moderation is not \r\nabout being weak. On the contrary, it shows courage \r\nand strength — the strength to push for peace and put \r\nthe people first. It is a principle that runs through all \r\ncivilizations and faiths. Islam embodies it in the concept \r\nof wasatiyyah and Confucianism as chung yung. Both \r\ntranslate as the middle path or the golden mean. It is a \r\nprinciple that we must rediscover. At the twenty-sixth \r\nSummit of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\nin Malaysia in April, we reaffirmed our commitment \r\nto such an approach, when we adopted the Langkawi \r\nDeclaration on the Global Movement of Moderates.\r\nMalaysia stands ready to share its experience \r\nof upholding Islam and marginalizing extremism; \r\nof implementing the objectives of shariah, while \r\npracticing democracy; of maintaining a multi-ethnic \r\nsociety, where different faiths coexist and prosper; and \r\nof showing that Islam can not only succeed, but also \r\ndrive progress and successful economic development. \r\nAs we cooperate to solve the scourges of poverty, \r\nhatred, war and human-made and natural disasters, \r\nwhich have given us today’s refugee crises, we must \r\ndraw from our spiritual traditions that generosity of \r\nspirit that goes beyond legal requirements. \r\nThe eightieth chapter of the Koran, the surah \r\n‘Abasa, opens with God criticizing the Prophet \r\nMuhammad — whom we Muslims regard as God’s \r\nBeloved — because he frowned and turned away when \r\none of his followers, a poor blind man, interrupted \r\nhim to ask a question while he was preaching to \r\na rich and powerful unbeliever. If God promptly \r\nrebuked the Prophet Muhammad, how much more \r\ndo we — especially we the leaders of the Muslim \r\nworld — stand to be rebuked by our Creator if we frown \r\nand turn away from our fellow Muslims, those who are \r\npoor and marginalized and are now fleeing Syria in \r\nmassive numbers, causing social and economic distress \r\nin Europe? Are we not then partially responsible for the \r\nensuing European hostility directed at Islam, the faith \r\nwe love, and at our fellow Muslims?\r\nOn that account, over the years, Malaysia has taken \r\nin numerous individuals f leeing war, starvation and \r\npersecution. We currently have hundreds of thousands \r\nof irregular migrants, and we took in more earlier this \r\nyear, when there was a dire humanitarian situation in \r\nthe Andaman Sea. I am pleased to announce today that, \r\nin order to help alleviate the current refugee crisis, \r\nMalaysia will do its share and open our doors to another \r\n3,000 Syrian migrants over the next three years. \r\nNew international solutions are needed to deal with \r\nthe migration crises. The millions f leeing are people, \r\nand they are people like us. They should be of concern \r\nto us all. We must respect our common humanity. We \r\nmust transcend the silos of race and faith. When we \r\nlook at the images of the desperate migrants, who are \r\nthe victims of extremists or whose lives are degraded by \r\nhunger and poverty, we must see them not as strangers, \r\nbut as our brothers and sisters.\r\nIt is only when we see that dreadful picture of \r\nthree-year-old Aylan Kurdi, who was washed ashore, \r\nand recognize our own children in that tragic boy’s \r\ninnocent face that we will act as our better selves. People \r\naround the world cry out for our help. We cannot — we \r\nmust not — pass on by.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nMalaysia for the statement he has just made.\r\nDato’ Sri Mohd Najib bin Tun Haji Abdul Razak, \r\nPrime Minister of Malaysia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign and European Affairs \r\nof the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Lajčák (Slovakia): During the past 70 years \r\nwe, the States Members of the United Nations, have \r\nbeen driven by the noble ideals and aspirations that \r\nthe visionary founders of the United Nations laid \r\ndown in its Charter in 1945. At the same time, we \r\nhave been regularly confronted with the grim realities \r\nof international affairs. Over its history, the United \r\nNations, both as an intergovernmental Organization \r\nand as an actor on the world stage, has been tested by \r\nnumerous conflicts, humanitarian crises and immense \r\n15-29658 35/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\npolitical and economic changes in the world, as well as \r\nby a lack of financial stability.\r\nThroughout all those years, the United Nations \r\nhas played a crucial role in preventing global conflicts \r\nand has carried out vital work around the world in its \r\nservice to humankind. From the outset, the United \r\nNations has made major contributions to furthering the \r\ndevelopment and codification of international law as \r\na way of regulating international relations. We should \r\ntake a step back to see how far we have come and how \r\nfar we need to go in meeting the challenges that exist \r\nacross the three pillars of the Organization’s work: \r\npeace and security, development and human rights. \r\nNew and acute challenges to the multilateral system \r\nand new threats to peace and security that transcend \r\nnational borders have, unfortunately, emerged. Each \r\nand everyone is concerned by the threats of pandemics, \r\nclimate change, migration, cybersecurity, and the \r\nmultifaceted and violent nature of terrorism, including \r\norganized crime. There are no exceptions.\r\nThe United Nations is the right place where all \r\nthose threats should be addressed and eventually \r\nsolved. I am deeply convinced that the United Nations \r\nremains strategically positioned to provide leadership \r\nand effective multilateral responses. A strong and \r\neffective United Nations means a better world, a more \r\ncaring and accepting world, where nations and peoples \r\nof different religions, cultures and history can live \r\ntogether in peace — a world where right is might, not \r\nmight makes right. I believe that strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations is the best investment for achieving the \r\nuniversal desire for peace, development, equality and \r\njustice in the world.\r\nWe should collectively seek practical means that \r\nwill enable the current system to live up to its original \r\npurposes. That will enable the United Nations to meet \r\nthe weighty demands that are being and will be made \r\nupon it today, tomorrow and in many years to come. \r\nThe Member States are the owners of the United \r\nNations. Every country — big or small, from North \r\nor South, landlocked or insular — has an important \r\nindividual responsibility and role to play as a driver \r\nof the necessary change. My Government has always \r\nhad strong confidence in the United Nations and \r\nremains ready to fully shoulder its responsibility and \r\ncommitments in that regard.\r\nThe scale of global development challenges is \r\nunprecedented. A couple of days ago, in this very \r\nplace we adopted the historic document defining the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, “Transforming Our \r\nWorld: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” \r\n(resolution 70/1). We may call it a programme for \r\na better planet, but it is not about the numbers, but \r\nabout changing our mindsets. It is setting up the new \r\nphilosophy of existence in a sustainable future. Its \r\ncornerstone is full inclusivity and zero disparity.\r\nThe global security environment has never been as \r\ndynamic and uncertain as today. The number of major \r\ncivil wars has almost tripled. The number of conflict \r\ncasualties has skyrocketed. The most worrisome fact is \r\nthe increased number of civilian casualties, including \r\nwomen and children. The United Nations works to \r\nmaintain international peace and security in a world \r\nwhere security threats are becoming more complex \r\nand asymmetric, and conflicts more intractable and \r\nless conducive to traditional political settlements. The \r\ncurrent pattern of violence also has serious implications \r\nfor the implementation of mandates to protect civilians \r\nin the field. The United Nations has increasingly \r\ncome under attack in areas where it has been present. \r\nNaturally, in such conditions, the level and the main \r\npriorities for United Nations involvement are being \r\nre-evaluated in a process of strategic reflection.\r\nA secondary effect is the dramatic increase in the \r\nnumber of refugees. The World Bank estimates that \r\nroughly one fifth of the world’s population is affected \r\nby some form of violence or insecurity. The total \r\nnumber of people forcibly displaced by war, conflict \r\nand persecution rose to roughly 60 million by the \r\nend of 2014. On a daily basis, we are confronted with \r\ngruesome images in the news or directly in our streets, \r\nsquares and transportation hubs. Forced displacement \r\nhas, sadly, become a deliberate and widespread \r\ntactic, meaning that displacement is not only a short-\r\nterm humanitarian problem, but also a long-term \r\ndevelopment and State-building issue.\r\nThe current migration crisis is one of the most \r\ncomplex challenges, one that we have to face up \r\nfront and address together. It affects all of us — the \r\ncountries of origin, transit and destination. It therefore \r\nrequires joint responses. Both immediate and long-\r\nterm measures are absolutely necessary to address \r\nthose challenges, which include illegal migration, the \r\nsmuggling of and trafficking in human beings, and \r\ngross human rights violations. \r\nWe must offer our assistance to those in need and \r\nprevent further tragedies involving refugees. For that to \r\nhappen, we need systematic and comprehensive action \r\n36/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nand close cooperation on the part of countries, both of \r\norigin and of destination, that will bring a long-term \r\nsustainable solution. We must address the root causes \r\nof migration, namely, conflicts, intolerance, violence, \r\npoverty and a lack of the conditions needed for a decent \r\nlife, just to mention a few.\r\nAs acknowledged many times before, the \r\nirreplaceable nature of the Organization is most \r\nmarked in peacekeeping. The past two decades have \r\nsignificantly tested the concept and conduct of United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. Slovakia has been \r\nan active contributor and stands ready to continue its \r\ncooperation with the United Nations in that field.\r\nI was particularly pleased to see that both \r\nreview panels — the High-level Independent Panel \r\non United Nations Peace Operations and that of the \r\nAdvisory Group of Experts on the 2015 Review of \r\nthe Peacebuilding Architecture — have put strong \r\nemphasis on enhanced conflict prevention, diplomatic \r\nengagement and mediation support in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations system. Speaking from my personal \r\nexperience as a mediator in South-Eastern Europe, I \r\ncannot but support the importance and high relevance \r\nof preventive diplomacy across the conflict spectrum \r\nand as a part of broader, nationally owned strategies \r\nto promote sustainable peace and development. The \r\nculture of conflict prevention and the conflict-resolution \r\napproaches that are now taking root in the United \r\nNations system must be further developed, alongside \r\nmore effective peacekeeping and peacebuilding.\r\nIt has been 15 years since the adoption of the \r\nlandmark Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), \r\non women and peace and security. Yet the impacts of \r\nconflicts on women and children are still inordinate, \r\nand their engagement in peace processes is still \r\ninsufficient. Gender equality is a natural precondition \r\nfor sustainable development, stability and peace. As \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan said, \r\n“When women thrive, all of society benefits, and \r\nsucceeding generations are given a better start in \r\nlife.” \r\nThe presence of women negotiators in high-profile \r\nUnited Nations peace and mediation processes, the \r\nrole of women deployed by the United Nations to major \r\nconflict zones and high-stake inter-State negotiations, \r\nas well as in peacekeeping and peacebuilding in general, \r\nis irreplaceable and should continue to grow.\r\nInternational terrorism in its most violent forms \r\nis an increasingly alarming threat to global peace \r\nand security, and those forms have become more \r\ndiverse and fragmented in recent years. Slovakia \r\nstrongly condemns all terrorist acts as criminal and \r\nunjustifiable. No terrorist act should be left without an \r\nadequate response from the international community. \r\nNo perpetrator should be left unpunished and no \r\nmovement affiliated with any form of terrorism should \r\nbe tolerated. \r\nMr. Zinsou (Benin), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe United Nations has done much to set standards \r\nin the fight against international terrorism and to \r\nencourage and help Member States to meet them. \r\nThe tenth anniversary of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy in 2016 will provide us \r\nwith an opportunity to make our efforts in this struggle \r\nmore efficient. It should be carried out in a multilateral \r\nand coordinated manner, with full respect for human \r\nrights and the rule of law. We should also redouble \r\nour efforts to conclude a comprehensive convention \r\non international terrorism. Last but not least, Member \r\nStates must strengthen their prevention efforts by \r\nworking directly with affected communities to counter \r\nthe violent extremism and radicalization that lead to \r\nterrorism. If we want to tackle this threat, we need \r\nto confront extremism in all its forms, violent and \r\nnon-violent. Hate has never been the way to achieve a \r\nbetter future for anyone. \r\n(spoke in French) \r\nWe are now fewer than 60 days away from the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Paris, where the international \r\ncommunity will discuss a new international climate \r\nchange agreement. The impact of climate change is \r\nvisible and undeniable throughout the world. Extreme \r\ndroughts, melting of polar ice, substantive changes in \r\nlong-term climate patterns and the rise in sea levels \r\nare the most glaring examples. As a result, Slovakia is \r\ncommitted to adopting at the United Nations climate \r\nconference this December a global binding climate \r\nagreement that will accelerate the shift towards \r\nsocieties and economies that are low-carbon and \r\nclimate-resilient worldwide.\r\n15-29658 37/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThere are various internal and external forces that \r\ncould drive any organization to change. Terrorism, \r\nweapons of mass destruction, poverty, disease, \r\ndisparities causing socioeconomic tensions resulting \r\nin migration — all these challenges pose vital threats \r\nto humankind, and the only difference is how quickly \r\nthe catastrophe strikes. The logical questions therefore \r\nrelate to how ready we are to effectively react to \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century and whether we \r\ncan draw useful lessons from the response to Ebola as \r\nan international health security threat. \r\nContinuous management reform, optimal use of \r\nmodern technologies, and gradual improvement of \r\nmethods and structures for work that takes into account \r\nchanges in the world are crucial if an organization \r\nwants to stay relevant. This is especially true for the \r\nUnited Nations. The seventieth anniversary of the \r\nOrganization is viewed by many as a timely moment \r\nfor achieving tangible progress. We need to address all \r\nexistential challenges with the same attention. Act as \r\none. Struggle as one. Deliver as one. One planet, one \r\nhumankind, one destiny.\r\nLet our work here at the United Nations be as real, \r\npractical and focused as possible so that we can deliver \r\ngood results in the spirit of cooperation and compromise. \r\nThe key desired result should be a strengthened and \r\nmore effective, streamlined and responsive United \r\nNations — a truly global organization that is better \r\nable to address interconnected and multidimensional \r\nthreats and challenges to international peace, security \r\nand development.\r\nI would like to conclude by quoting Norman \r\nCousins, an American political journalist and professor, \r\nwho received the United Nations Peace Medal in 1971: \r\n“If the United Nations is to survive, those who \r\nrepresent it must bolster it; those who advocate it \r\nmust submit to it; and those who believe in it must \r\nfight for it.” \r\nThe current General Assembly session will be a new \r\ntest of our commitment and ability to join forces in the \r\npursuit of common goals. I am confident that under the \r\nleadership of President Lykketoft, we will be able to \r\nachieve the desired outcome.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Frank-Walter \r\nSteinmeier, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany.\r\nMr. Steinmeier (Germany) (spoke in German; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): The founding \r\nof the United Nations 70 years ago cast light on the \r\ndark twentieth century. That was a pivotal moment for \r\nour world. It came not against a backdrop of glorious \r\nsunshine and green pastures, but amid the ruins of \r\nthe Second World War with its more than 50 million \r\ngraves. As the winter of the Cold War spread its frosty \r\nfingers, the mothers and fathers of the United Nations \r\nforged the foundations of a new order — an order that is \r\nnot perfect, and which may never be perfect, but which \r\nhas often enough protected us from relapse into the old \r\nbarbarism.\r\nToday, 70 years on, it is clear that we are again \r\nliving in turbulent times. Millions of people are gravely \r\naffected by wars and violence, and more than 60 million \r\npeople have f led their homes — more than at any time \r\nsince the end of the Second World War.\r\nThe foundations of the United Nations are still \r\nstrong, but the world order built on them has come \r\nloose from its moorings. The old balance of power is \r\nunder pressure. Powerful new players have emerged on \r\nthe world stage. Most serious of all, non-State actors \r\nare now increasingly responsible for war and violence. \r\nThey abide by no rules — not even the minimum \r\nstandards enshrined in the international law of war.\r\nWe therefore urgently need new buttresses and \r\npillars so that the order based on the United Nations can \r\nwithstand the tempests of our times. What form could \r\nthese new pillars take? How should the world order of \r\ntomorrow look?\r\nI do not think that there is a theoretical answer to \r\nthat question; the only answer is a practical one. Just as \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations was adopted as a bold \r\nresponse to war and suffering, today new pillars will be \r\nbuilt only if States are ready to assume responsibility \r\nand work together to find concrete answers to the crises \r\nof our times — to poverty and underdevelopment, to \r\nrefugees and migration, to the devastating civil war \r\nin Syria and the failing States across the arc of crisis \r\nfrom Libya to Afghanistan, to religious extremism and \r\nterrorism and the murderous deeds of the people who \r\ncall themselves the Islamic State.\r\nThere is, however, one major difference between \r\nnow and the situation 70 years ago. The world of today \r\n38/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nis more closely interconnected than ever before. Borders \r\nare becoming blurred. In this age of globalization, \r\nsome say, the world has become a village. If that is so, \r\nthen we are all neighbours, and I would advise us to \r\nact as good neighbours. We come from very different \r\nbackgrounds. We have different traditions, religions, \r\nvalues and world views. That diversity must be \r\nrespected. No world view takes precedence over any \r\nother, but I can think of no culture in which people are \r\nunaware of what it means to be a good neighbour and in \r\nwhich people do not appreciate living in an atmosphere \r\nof good-neighbourliness.\r\nNobody is investing as much hope in that spirit \r\nof good-neighbourliness today than the millions of \r\nwomen, men and children who have f led their homes. \r\nMy country has assumed its responsibility towards \r\nthem over the past months. Since the beginning of the \r\nyear, we have taken in 600,000 refugees. Currently, \r\nupwards of 10,000 new refugees are arriving every \r\nday. Those statistics show that even we cannot absorb \r\nsuch numbers by ourselves over the long term. We \r\nneed to arrive at a European solution, together with our \r\nEuropean neighbours, as well as with our neighbours \r\naround the Mediterranean, especially Turkey.\r\nSecondly, the relief agencies of the United \r\nNations system — the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food \r\nProgramme, the United Nations Relief and Works \r\nAgency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East and \r\nthe Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs — all help people in need, on the spot and with no \r\nintermediaries. It is scandalous that those organizations \r\nare underfunded to the point that they have to cut food \r\nrations and medical aid. Accordingly, I met with the \r\nmembers of the Group of Seven and other partners the \r\nday before yesterday, and I am delighted to report that \r\ntogether we have raised an additional $1.8 billion, of \r\nwhich over $100 million will come from Germany, \r\nintended for the United Nations relief agencies. That \r\nwill also help relieve the burden on the neighbouring \r\ncountries in which the huge majority of refugees arrive, \r\nespecially Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They too need \r\nour help, so that one exodus does not trigger another.\r\nBut good-neighbourliness comprises more than \r\njust humanity and compassion. Good-neighbourliness \r\nalso presupposes that we agree on joint rules that we \r\nall must obey. They include respecting each other’s \r\nborders and sovereignty. That fundamental norm is \r\nstill being violated, even in Europe. The European \r\nUnion unanimously condemned Russia’s annexation \r\nof the Crimea and the actions in eastern Ukraine, and \r\nwe responded, not only in terms of condemnation and \r\nisolation, but also by launching a political process to \r\ndefuse the conflict. The Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation (OSCE) has played an indispensable role \r\nin that process from the outset. We want to further \r\nstrengthen the OSCE as an institution for our common \r\nsecurity when we Germans assume its chairmanship \r\nnext year.\r\nActive political responsibility is also part and \r\nparcel of good-neighbourliness. A neighbourhood in \r\nwhich nobody looks beyond their garden gate will not \r\nbe worth living in for long. People must be vigilant, \r\nbecause there are many conflicts that can only be solved \r\nin concert and by means of multilateral diplomacy. \r\nWhile that may take time and perseverance, it works.\r\nThis past summer, the five permanent members \r\nof the Security Council and Germany concluded an \r\nagreement with Iran. After more than 10 years of \r\nnegotiations, we managed to agree that Iran will never \r\nhave an atomic bomb and that we can verify this. The \r\nnegotiations succeeded in bringing a number of actors \r\nto the same table, including Russia and the United \r\nStates of America. The negotiations have therefore \r\nproved that while neighbours may not like one another, \r\nthey can still solve problems together. Indeed they must \r\ndo so, if living side by side is not to become unbearable \r\nfor them both.\r\nThe agreement that was reached has created common \r\nground on which greater security can be established in \r\nthe Middle East, if we persevere in our joint efforts. \r\nHowever, the realities are still somewhat different. In \r\nSyria, in the fifth year of the war, the slaughter knows \r\nno end. We will only put an end to it by acting together. \r\nWe have to halt the brutality of Al-Assad’s dictatorship, \r\nas evinced by its use of barrel bombs and torture. We \r\nhave to break the control of the Islamic State. We have \r\nto silence the guns in Syria and provide the people who \r\nlive there with access to humanitarian aid.\r\nMoreover, we also share the commons goals of \r\npreserving the territorial integrity of Syria and restoring \r\nconditions in which all ethnic and religious groups can \r\nlive in peace with each other, as well as in peace with \r\nneighbouring countries. Those are goals that all the \r\nactors must believe in, whatever differences may exist \r\nbetween the United States of America and Russia or \r\nbetween Saudi Arabia and Iran.\r\n15-29658 39/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nWe already have a basis for joint action aimed at \r\nachieving those goals, as illustrated by Security Council \r\nresolution 2139 (2014). We must now implement it \r\ntogether with all the stakeholders as a first step towards \r\ndefusing the conflict. I appeal to the stakeholders in \r\nSyria and Syria’s neighbours — but not only to them. \r\nInstead of multilateral decisions, such as those recently \r\ntaken by Russia, regarding military action in Syria, \r\nwe need Russia to now take political action that will \r\nadvocate transition in Syria. That would be an important \r\ncontribution to ending the stalemate. For that stalemate \r\nis a lethal one, which claims new lives every day.\r\nAt the risk of repeating myself, let me stress that \r\nwhen dealing with a humanitarian catastrophe as \r\nhorrifying as the one in Syria, we are all neighbours. \r\nThat is what must prompt us to crawl out of our \r\ndiplomatic trenches, for there can be no military \r\nsolution. Neither supposed eternal truths nor national \r\ninterests must be allowed to obstruct efforts to take the \r\nfirst steps in defusing the conflict in Syria.\r\nIn these turbulent times, the idea of universal good-\r\nneighbourliness would be no more than a dream if there \r\nwere not already an umbrella, a roof, under which \r\nuniversal good-neighbourliness has been practised \r\nfor decades. Today we need the United Nations more \r\nthan ever. We need a legitimate and responsive United \r\nNations, and that is why Germany is campaigning \r\nfor the reform of the United Nations and the Security \r\nCouncil. That is why we are working with others on the \r\nmajor global projects, on the ambitious 2030 Agenda \r\nSustainable Development Goals (resolution 70/1), which \r\nhas just been adopted and on the equally, if not more, \r\nambitious goals to combat climate change, which we \r\nhope to adopt together at the Conference of the Parties \r\nin Paris this December.\r\nThe United Nations provides a framework, a roof, \r\nfor our global endeavours. But under that roof, the work \r\nmust continue at many levels. We Germans believe, first, \r\nthat the way forward lies in regional cooperation in the \r\nEuropean Union and the OSCE and in cooperation with \r\nother regional organizations, such as the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations and the African Union, among \r\nothers. Secondly, we are committed to re-establishing \r\nand stabilizing State structures across the arc of crisis \r\nfrom Libya to Iraq and Afghanistan. And thirdly, \r\nespecially in our capacity as President of the Human \r\nRights Council, we are championing the fundamental \r\nimportance of human rights. For no political order can \r\nendure if the people are not secure in their rights.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to return to the founding \r\nof the United Nations 70 years ago. As magnificent \r\nas that moment was, it also inspires a sense of great \r\nhumility in me as a German, because the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations was part of humankind’s response \r\nto the war and inhumanity that had originated in my \r\ncountry. In the seven decades that have passed since \r\nthat time, Germany has been fortunate enough to be \r\ngradually and cautiously welcomed back into the heart \r\nof the international community. For that, we Germans \r\nare grateful, but we are also aware of our responsibility. \r\nWhen Mr. Willy Brandt became the Federal Chancellor \r\nof Germany in 1969, he said that we Germans want to \r\nbe a people of good neighbours. At the time, Germany \r\nwas still divided, and those words were meant as a \r\ngesture of reconciliation towards Poland, France and \r\nthe other European neighbours that had suffered greatly \r\nat German hands.\r\nToday, when a Syrian family in Berlin tells me their \r\ntale of war and expulsion, Mr. Brandt’s words take on a \r\nnew meaning. Now the world has become smaller, but \r\nthe crises are no fewer. It is time for us to once again \r\nreaffirm that we Germans want to be a people of good \r\nneighbours to others near and far.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Jean Asselborn, \r\nMinister for Foreign and European Affairs and Minister \r\nfor Immigration and Refugees of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg.\r\nMr. Asselborn (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): \r\nThe United Nations was created, not to lead humankind \r\nto heaven but to save it from hell. These were the apt \r\nwords of Mr. Dag Hammarskjöld, who served as the \r\nsecond Secretary-General, from 1953 to 1961, and saw \r\nthings for what they were. The United Nations was \r\ncreated according to the people’s will 70 years ago, \r\nfollowing the Second World War, to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war. Today, in a \r\nworld beset by armed conflict, violent extremism, \r\nradicalization and terrorism, in a world where war, \r\npersecution and violations of human rights force \r\nmillions and millions of people — men, women and \r\nchildren — to leave their homes and to take to the road \r\nin mass exoduses in search of safety and dignity, the \r\nachievement of that goal seems far more urgent than \r\never.\r\nThe choice of theme for the seventieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly, “The United Nations at 70: the \r\nroad ahead for peace, security and human rights”, was \r\n40/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nwise indeed. As we have said many times from this \r\nrostrum, human rights and the rule of law are closely \r\ninterconnected and one cannot exist without the other. \r\nI shall not revert again to the historic adoption of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda except to recall that \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, speaking in San \r\nFrancisco in June and commenting on the importance \r\nand scope of this universal programme, observed that \r\nwe were the first generation that could put an end to \r\npoverty in the world and the last generation that could \r\ntake action to prevent the worst consequences of a \r\nwarming Earth.\r\nThat observation should cause us to renew \r\nour commitment to a better future for all, to show \r\nsolidarity, to unite our forces, pursuant to the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. As we did when we reached \r\nagreement on the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, we must \r\nspare no effort to come together at the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nParis in December, so that we can accept an ambitious \r\nand binding climate change agreement that applies \r\nto all countries and will keep the increase in global \r\nwarming to below 2°C. As President of the European \r\nCouncil, Luxembourg will spare no effort to ensure \r\nthat the Paris meeting will be a success. We must seize \r\nthis historic opportunity.\r\nAnother priority project during Luxembourg’s \r\npresidency of the Council in which I will invest all my \r\nenergies is that of migration. According to the data of \r\nthe Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees, \r\ntoday there are 59.5 million displaced persons, \r\nincluding refugees, or more than at any time since 1945, \r\nat the end of the Second World War. As the Secretary-\r\nGeneral noted, the continuous f low of migrants and \r\nthe surge of human misery bring us face to face with \r\nour responsibilities as political leaders, as members of \r\nthe international community and, obviously, as human \r\nbeings.\r\nIn times of crisis, unfortunately, various unilateral \r\nvague desires and nationalist or populist reflexes seem \r\nto reappear. We saw that happen again, tragically, in \r\nthe summer. But no country can face the unprecedented \r\ncrisis of migrants and refugees alone. Withdrawing \r\ninto ourselves is not the answer. We must act together, \r\nas the countries of origin, transit and destination of \r\nmigrants, and respond to the challenges posed by \r\nmigrant movements in the Mediterranean, the Balkans \r\nand elsewhere. Only if we firmly anchor our actions \r\nin respect for our international commitments, shall we \r\nfind a solution worthy of our shared values, the values \r\nfor which the United Nations and the European Union \r\nwere founded. \r\nAt the level of the European Union we took a \r\nfirst step during the past week by deciding to relocate \r\nwithin the countries of the Union 120,000 people who \r\nclearly need international protection. Other decisions \r\nwill follow shortly. The European Union will respond \r\nto the urgent needs of refugees by donating at least an \r\nadditional €1 billion to the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, the World Food \r\nProgramme and other such bodies. We will increase our \r\nassistance to Lebanon, Jordan and Turkey to deal with \r\nthe Syrian refugee crisis. We will help Western Balkan \r\ncountries deal with the f low of refugees, including \r\nthrough pre-accession instruments. \r\nWe cannot simply deal with the symptoms of the \r\ncrisis. We must also tackle the root causes of migration \r\nand of refugee f lows: development inequalities, \r\nespecially in Africa; conflict and violence; the absence \r\nof the rule of law; persecution and violations of human \r\nrights; and impunity. That brings us back to the \r\ninterconnectedness of security, development and respect \r\nfor human rights and the need to adopt a comprehensive, \r\nintegrated approach for the most effective application to \r\ndevelopment and migration of a combination of foreign \r\npolicy, security, trade and cooperation instruments. \r\nThe upcoming Valletta summit on migration on 11 and \r\n12 November will provide an opportunity for us to \r\ndiscuss a comprehensive approach to the question of \r\nmigration with our African partners, an opportunity \r\nwhich I welcome.\r\nFor more than four years, Syria has been \r\nsynonymous with war, violence and exodus. One in six \r\nSyrians has now fled the country. One out of two has \r\nhad to leave home. Every day 9,500 persons are added \r\nto the list of displaced persons. Every minute a family \r\nis forced to abandon everything. A whole of generation \r\nof children has been exposed to war, violence and death \r\nand deprived of fundamental freedoms, protection and \r\neducation. More than 220,000 people have lost their \r\nlives. Indiscriminate aerial bombing, the release of \r\nbarrel bombs, the acts of violence and the violations of \r\nhuman rights and international law continue unabated. \r\nThe sieges continue. The denial of assistance and the \r\nobstruction of humanitarian assistance persist. Crimes \r\n15-29658 41/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nagainst humanity and war crimes are committed evey \r\nday with impunity. \r\nThat cannot continue; it must be stopped. The \r\nsituation is the Security Council’s responsibility and \r\nit is the responsibility of all of us. The solution to the \r\nSyrian conflict cannot be humanitarian, nor can it be \r\nmilitary.\r\nToday, the worst thing is the indiscriminate shelling \r\nin an undisciplined way and without prior coordination. \r\nThe people are waiting for us to end the carnage rather \r\nthan to make it worse. \r\nA solution to the conflict can only be political. As \r\nwe have said time and again, any lasting settlement \r\nrequires a political transition that meets the legitimate \r\naspirations of the Syrian people, in line with the Geneva \r\ncommuniqué (S/2012/522, annex). Words must be \r\nfollowed by actions. It is time for negotiations to finally \r\nbegin. All of us must support Special Envoy Staffan de \r\nMistura in his efforts. The fate of the Syrian people and \r\nthe stability of Syria and of its neighbours within and \r\nbeyond the region depend on it.\r\nIn that context, I will say a word on the destructive \r\nbarbarism of the terrorist group Daesh and the urgent \r\nneed to combat it. The tragic current situation in \r\nSyria, Iraq and Libya, and its repercussions in Europe, \r\ndemonstrates that the international community must \r\nwork together to stop the advance of Daesh. The day \r\nbefore yesterday, my country participated in a summit \r\nmeeting organized by President Obama, which was \r\nthe continuation of a discussion held in the Security \r\nCouncil one year ago (see S/PV.7272). The Assembly \r\ncan continue to count on our country’s support in \r\ncombating Daesh and violent extremism, whether \r\nin terms of preventing radicalization, exchanging \r\nintelligence, countering the phenomenon of foreign \r\nterrorist fighters or taking measures against terrorist \r\nfinancing.\r\nI must mention another tragedy at the heart of the \r\ntumult in the Middle East, which is the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict. The year 2015 was sadly emblematic of the \r\nimpasse of the peace process, which, at present, is only \r\nthat in name. In an environment characterized by a total \r\nlack of prospects and the continuing cycle of revenge, \r\nthe idea that there might be an alternative to the two-\r\nState solution is beginning to gain public support and \r\nto be applied on the ground. During my travels in the \r\nregion last month, I was able to see that development \r\nfor myself. But it involves an illusion, and perhaps a \r\nvery dangerous one. The two-State solution remains \r\nthe only way forward. The conditions for that solution \r\nare obvious, both with respect to the 1967 borders and \r\nthe establishment of Jerusalem as the capital of the two \r\nStates.\r\nThe call to stop the settlements is not a matter \r\nof Israel-bashing, as it was described by the Prime \r\nMinister of Israel earlier today. Rather, it is a call to \r\nreason, to give the resumption of negotiations a chance. \r\nBut to save the two-State solution, we must change our \r\nmindset. We must think outside the box. Now is no \r\nlonger the time for efforts that lead nowhere. We must \r\nencourage a new negotiating format, broaden the circle \r\nof participants so that there is a greater involvement of \r\nEurope and especially of the Arab countries, reactivate \r\nthe role of the Security Council and set a reasonable \r\ntime frame within which to conclude the negotiations. \r\nIsrael has the right to live in peace and security, \r\nbut it is clear to me that Israel’s security in the long and \r\nmedium term will depend on the creation of a sovereign \r\nand democratic State of Palestine, living alongside \r\nit. The two-State solution is the only solution that is \r\njust and moral for both parties. As of yesterday, the \r\nPalestinian f lag began to f ly beside those of the States \r\nMembers of the Organization. Let us all work to make \r\nit become more than just a symbol.\r\nThe comprehensive solution to the Iranian nuclear \r\nissue, which the E3+3 and the European Union \r\nreached after several years of negotiations with Iran, \r\ndemonstrates that we should not lose faith in the power \r\nof diplomacy, even when tackling the thorniest of issues. \r\nThe international community has made considerable \r\nefforts in those negotiations with Iran, which also serve \r\nthe security interests of Israel. Let us be less fatalistic. \r\nIsrael’s right to exist is not affected by that agreement. \r\nIn fact, the opposite is the case. We believe that the \r\nfull and rigorous implementation of the Joint Plan of \r\nAction, adopted on 14 July, will mark a fundamental \r\nturning point for peace and security in the region.\r\nWe could also say much more regarding other \r\nregions in the world, including Africa, as well as my \r\nown continent, Europe, where a conflict dating from \r\nanother era started to affect Ukraine in February 2014 \r\nand is still ongoing. Thanks to substantial mediation \r\nefforts and commitment on the part of Germany, France \r\nand the European Union; thanks to close cooperation \r\nbetween regional and international organizations, \r\nfirst and foremost among them the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe; and thanks to \r\n42/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nthe continuous monitoring of the United Nations, \r\nespecially of the human rights situation in the Crimea \r\nand in eastern Ukraine, the foundations of a settlement \r\nof the crisis in Ukraine have been established in recent \r\nmonths. Commendable efforts have also been made \r\nwith respect to regional autonomy and decentralization. \r\nThe upcoming regional elections will be critical. It \r\nwill be especially vital to hold them throughout the \r\ncountry and, therefore, in the Donbas region, under \r\nthe authority of Ukrainian law. It is essential that each \r\nparty fully respect the commitments entered into in the \r\nMinsk agreements.\r\nWhen we talk of Ukraine, the Middle East, South \r\nSudan, the Central African Republic, Mali or Burkina \r\nFaso, there is one constant in all the situations, which \r\nis that diplomacy and the commitment to human rights \r\nand the rule of law must prevail, if we are to solve \r\ntoday’s profound crises. Our Secretary-General has \r\nfully risen to the challenge with the Human Rights Up \r\nFront initiative, firmly reminding us of our collective \r\nresponsibility to protect and to place human rights at \r\nthe centre of United Nations efforts to prevent conflict. \r\nTo that end, all the actors and organs within the United \r\nNations system must play their respective roles.\r\nAllow me to focus on the particular role of the \r\nSecurity Council and its members. According to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, the primary responsibility \r\nfor maintaining peace and international security \r\nwas conferred upon the Security Council to “ensure \r\nprompt and effective action by the United Nations”. \r\nThe paralysis of the Council, when populations are \r\nthreatened with horrific crimes, runs counter to the \r\nspirit of the Charter. That is why we welcome and \r\nsupport the initiative launched by France aimed at \r\nensuring that the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil refrain from using the right of veto in cases of \r\nmass atrocities.\r\nBut beyond the permanent members, each of the \r\nMember States must assume its responsibility. Each \r\none has its role to play, in working towards decisive \r\naction by the Security Council to prevent or halt mass \r\natrocities. We therefore encourage all Member States \r\nto support the code of conduct as it relates to the action \r\nof the Security Council against genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. It will be officially \r\nlaunched on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations. The same code of conduct has \r\nbeen developed by the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group, of which Luxembourg is a \r\nmember. The responsibility to protect must cease to be \r\nan abstract principle and become a concrete reality. \r\nAt 70 years of age, the United Nations must be able \r\nadapt in order to be up to the challenges it faces. On \r\nthat account, we welcome the ongoing reviews that \r\naim to make United Nations actions more efficient in \r\nits peacekeeping operations, peacebuilding or in the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000), which recognizes women’s indispensable role \r\nin peace and security. Luxembourg will continue to \r\nengage with the numerous Member States that wish \r\nto push forward a reform of the United Nations. I am \r\nobviously thinking, in particular, about a reform that \r\nwould make the Security Council more effective, \r\ntransparent and representative of today’s world.\r\nLet me conclude my remarks as I began them, \r\nwith a quotation. This one is from Mahatma Gandhi. \r\nI understand it as an exhortation and a reminder of the \r\nresponsibilities that we must shoulder, if we want to \r\nrealize the dream of the creators of our Organization, \r\nwhich is the dream of a world of peace and dignity for \r\nall and the dream of a better world: “You must be the \r\nchange you wish to see in the world”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to Her Excellency Ms. Sushma Swaraj, \r\nMinister for External Affairs of the Republic of India.\r\nMs. Swaraj (India) (spoke in Hindi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): The United \r\nNations is marking its seventieth anniversary this year, \r\nmaking this session of the General Assembly a historic \r\none. I hope that this year will also be historic for the \r\nUnited Nations in terms of outcomes. I would like to \r\nassure the President that he will receive India’s full \r\nsupport in his efforts.\r\nSeventy years ago, the foundations of the United \r\nNations were laid at the San Francisco Conference, \r\nin a city on the west coast of this country. India was \r\none of the signatory countries of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, although at that time we were not \r\nindependent. We obtained our independence two years \r\nlater. When the United Nations was established, a rather \r\ndiminutive-looking man with the powerful weapon of \r\nnon-violence was writing the final act in a struggle that \r\nwould become a symbol of hope for the colonized and \r\nthe oppressed everywhere. I am grateful that the United \r\nNations has proclaimed the birthday of this extraordinary \r\nman as the International Day of Non-Violence. It is a \r\npleasing coincidence that tomorrow is 2 October, and \r\n15-29658 43/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nthat we will be celebrating his birthday then. Mahatma \r\nGandhi said, “The difference between what we do and \r\nwhat we are capable of doing would suffice to solve \r\nmost of the world’s problems”. His message is most \r\nfitting in the context of the United Nations.\r\nThe seventieth year of any human being’s life is a \r\nmilestone from which to look back and reflect on what \r\none has achieved and what one has lost. Similarly, for \r\npeople associated with an institution, the seventieth \r\nyear provides an opportunity to analyse whether the \r\ninstitution has fulfilled its purpose and achieved \r\nthe goals set for it at its establishment. Today we \r\nneed to ask ourselves whether we have fulfilled the \r\npurpose and achieved the goals for which the United \r\nNations was established 70 years ago. When I ask \r\nmyself that question, I receive an affirmative answer \r\nfor some questions and a negative one for others. For \r\nexample, the United Nations has been successful in \r\npreventing a third world war, assisting decolonization \r\nand dismantling apartheid. It has been successful in \r\ncombating global epidemics, reducing global hunger \r\nand promoting democracy and human rights.\r\nYet, when we ask ourselves whether we have been \r\nable to prevent conflicts taking place in various parts \r\nof the world, the answer is “no”. If we ask whether we \r\nwere able to find permanent solutions to those conflicts, \r\nthe answer is “no”. If we ask whether we were able to \r\nshow the path of peace to a world which is treading \r\nthe path of violence, the answer is “no”. According \r\nto those parameters, the United Nations appears to \r\nbe ineffective at maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, an institution that has failed to effectively \r\naddress new challenges in that area.\r\nToday, the world is ravaged by war on three \r\ncontinents, with the Security Council powerless or \r\nunwilling to stem the f low of blood. Traditional solutions \r\nthat rely on force have only exacerbated problems. \r\nWe must ask ourselves if we have the political will to \r\ncraft alternatives to conflict and to pursue them with \r\ncommitment and single-minded dedication. Nowhere is \r\nsuch a goal more important than in peacekeeping. Under \r\nthe blue f lag, men and women are constantly working \r\nto prevent conflict, protect civilians and sustain peace \r\nprocesses. With 180,000 peacekeepers deployed so far, \r\nIndia has been the largest contributor to international \r\nsecurity provided by the United Nations. Even today, \r\nabout 8,000 Indian military and police personnel are \r\nparticipating in 10 peacekeeping missions, operating in \r\nhighly challenging environments.\r\nIndia remains committed to continuing its support \r\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations and even to \r\nenhancing its contributions, as announced by our Prime \r\nMinister at the leaders summit on peacekeeping. Our \r\nnew contributions will cover all aspects of peacekeeping: \r\npersonnel, enablers and training. At the same time, no \r\ndilution of the cardinal principles of peacekeeping must \r\noccur. The fact that troop-contributing countries have \r\nno role in the formulation of mandates, which are often \r\namended without consultation, is a matter of concern. \r\nThat is a clear violation of Article 44 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. We also believe that peacekeeping \r\noperations cannot be a substitute for political solutions, \r\na fact that the High-Level Independent Panel on Peace \r\nOperations underscored.\r\nAs we mark the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations, I take this opportunity to pay tribute to \r\nthe more than 3,300 peacekeepers, including 161 from \r\nIndia, who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We stand \r\nready to contribute to the memorial wall for United \r\nNations peacekeepers, which was approved by the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-ninth session.\r\nThe safety of our peacekeepers, the security of \r\nour nations, and indeed the future of the international \r\ncommunity itself now depend on how we respond to \r\nthe greatest threat that we face today: terrorism. It is a \r\nthreat that India has lived with for more than a quarter \r\nof a century, and one that was tragically brought home \r\nto this very city in the autumn of 2001. Since then, \r\nwe have not adequately countered the proliferation of \r\nterrorist acts, the rise of extremist ideologies and the \r\nimpunity of States that back terrorism.\r\nOnly organized international action can defeat \r\ninternational terrorism. The world must demonstrate \r\nzero tolerance for terrorists who kill and maim innocent \r\ncivilians and base its action on the principle of prosecute \r\nor extradite. The international community must make \r\ncountries that provide financing to terrorists and safe \r\nhavens for their training, arming and operations pay a \r\nheavy price.\r\nEqually important, the establishment of an \r\ninternational legal regime, under a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism, can no longer be \r\nheld up. Nineteen years ago, in 1996, India proposed \r\nsuch a regime at the United Nations, but the Member \r\nStates have been unable to adopt it and have become \r\nmired in the issue of definition. We have to understand \r\nthat no such distinction exists as good terrorists and \r\nbad terrorists, and that terrorism cannot be linked \r\n44/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nto any religion. A terrorist is a terrorist, and anyone \r\nwho commits crimes against humanity cannot have \r\na religion. Therefore, I appeal to everyone to come \r\ntogether during this seventieth anniversary year of the \r\nUnited Nations and to pledge to unanimously adopt a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism.\r\nWhile on the subject of terrorism, I take this \r\nopportunity to share the challenges that we face in our \r\nties with Pakistan. None of us can accept that terrorism \r\nis a legitimate instrument of statecraft. The world shared \r\nour outrage at the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which \r\ncitizens of many nations were helplessly butchered. \r\nThat the mastermind behind the attack is walking free \r\nis an affront to the entire international community. \r\nNot only have past assurances in this regard not been \r\nhonoured, but new cross-border terrorist attacks have \r\ntaken place recently, and two terrorists from across the \r\nborder have been captured alive. We all know that these \r\nattacks are meant to destabilize India and legitimize \r\nPakistan’s illegal occupation of parts of the Indian State \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir and its claim to the rest of it.\r\nLet me use this occasion to spell out our approach \r\nclearly. India remains open to dialogue but finds talks \r\nand terrorism to be incompatible. Yesterday, the Prime \r\nMinister of Pakistan proposed what he termed a new \r\nfour-point peace initiative. I would like to respond \r\nto this. We do not need four points. We need just \r\none — give up terrorism and let us sit down and talk. \r\nThis will solve all the problems. That was precisely \r\nwhat was discussed and decided by the two Prime \r\nMinisters in Ufa this July. Let us hold talks, at the level \r\nof national security advisers, on all issues connected \r\nto terrorism and arrange an early meeting of our \r\nDirectors-General of Military Operations to address \r\nthe situation on the border. If the response is serious and \r\ncredible, India is prepared to address all outstanding \r\nissues through bilateral dialogue. Even as we counter \r\nthe menace of terrorism, we must acknowledge that real \r\nsocial and economic progress remains a critical goal. \r\nThe elimination of basic human want leads almost \r\ninvariably to more peaceful societies, as is evidenced \r\nby a map of the conflicts that engulf parts of the world.\r\nJust a few days ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), with \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals at its core. They \r\nconstitute a blueprint that is more comprehensive \r\nand holistic than the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. However, their successful implementation \r\nwill require political resolve and an inclination to \r\nshare both technology and financial resources, while \r\nsimultaneously improving our delivery mechanisms. As \r\na woman and an elected Member of Parliament, it has \r\nbeen my firm conviction that there is a shortcut to real \r\nsocial change, and that is empowering the girl child. \r\nOur Government’s policy and our Prime Minister’s \r\nprogramme of Educate the Girl Child to Empower Her \r\nwas conceived with that vision. \r\nOur future rests on our building a sustainable \r\nplanet for our children and our children’s children. As \r\nwe prepare to meet in two months’ time, in Paris, the \r\nworld expects us to deliver an ambitious and credible \r\nagreement on climate change. We have a duty to take \r\ncommon action, but in doing so we must keep in mind \r\nthe larger historical contributions of some and the \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities of others. If Mahatma \r\nGandhi were among us today, he would ask if we have \r\nused the resources of the planet for our needs or for \r\nour greed. He would also ask if adapting our lifestyle \r\nchoices and reducing extravagant consumption would \r\nhelp us to correct our course. For this reason, the \r\nagreement in Paris needs to be comprehensive and \r\nequitable, while delivering concrete action. Developing \r\ncountries can do more if they are enabled in their \r\nefforts by support from developed countries in the \r\nareas of finance, technology transfer and capacity-\r\nbuilding. India is and always has been a willing partner \r\nin global efforts towards this goal. We will play our due \r\nrole in reaching a meaningful, equitable and effective \r\nagreement in Paris.\r\nIndia’s reverence for the environment is based on \r\nour traditions, which have always held nature as sacred. \r\nThe health of the planet is tied to our own well-being, \r\nand it is this holistic approach that guided us in our \r\ncall for the First International Day of Yoga, which was \r\ncelebrated with much fervour in 192 countries of the \r\nworld, as well as in this hallowed institution. I thank \r\nthe international community for its enthusiasm and \r\nsupport in this regard. I hope that the seed that has been \r\nplanted will grow into a magnificent tree.\r\nI also congratulate States for their prompt action \r\nin tackling the threat of global epidemics. By linking \r\nour efforts, we have managed to eradicate smallpox and \r\nnearly eradicate polio. HIV/AIDS has been controlled \r\nand, more recently, the Ebola outbreak was contained, \r\nalthough not before an unacceptably high price in lives \r\nhad been paid. The Ebola epidemic is an important \r\nexample of how national action and international \r\nsupport can resolve a global crisis. We are proud that \r\n15-29658 45/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nIndia played its due part in these efforts. Inspired by \r\nour successes, we must redouble our efforts to eradicate \r\nother diseases, whether it be tuberculosis or malaria.\r\nNatural disasters and man-made conflicts also \r\ndeserve our coordinated response. In recent months, \r\nthe international community has been found wanting in \r\nits response to the refugee crisis caused by the conflict \r\nsituations in Syria, Iraq and Libya. What is needed \r\nis a swift response backed by political will. Our own \r\nresponse to humanitarian crises in our neighbourhood \r\nhas been quick, responsive and holistic. Whether in \r\nNepal or Yemen, India has emerged as a net security \r\nprovider, assisting not only our nationals but those \r\nof other countries that sought our help. India will be \r\nhosting the first Asian Ministerial Conference on \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction in November 2016, when the \r\ntopic will be the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction.\r\nLike the United Nations, India has walked a \r\nlong way these past 70 years. As 1.25 billion of my \r\ncountrymen would attest, we have done so happy \r\nin the knowledge that our democratic traditions are \r\ndeeply embedded. Nonetheless, every once in a while, \r\nthere is a need for transformative change — one that \r\ncan reinvigorate the nation and redeem its spirit. Ever \r\nsince the new Government of Prime Minister Modi \r\ntook office a year and a half ago, we have committed \r\nourselves to this renewal. It is one that has enabled India \r\nto play its rightful role in international affairs, while \r\nalso becoming the fastest-growing major economy in \r\nthe world. The driving force of this comprehensive \r\nrenewal has been premised on the motto of sabka saath, \r\nsabka vikas, which places emphasis on the welfare of \r\nall our people.\r\nAt the same time, we have started to reach out \r\nenthusiastically to all our partners in the international \r\ncommunity. Our efforts have focused, first and \r\nforemost, on our immediate neighbourhood and the \r\nresults have been truly transformational. We have also \r\nreached out to our extended neighbourhood, renewing \r\nancient linkages and constructing modern economic \r\npartnerships, including, most recently, a summit with 14 \r\nPacific island nations. Our Act East policy has replaced \r\nthe previous one, Look East, with a more vigorous \r\nand proactive engagement in an economically vibrant \r\nregion, and complements our Link West engagement.\r\nWe remain committed to the Middle East \r\npeace process, which is key to preventing further \r\nradicalization of the region. We continue to hope that a \r\nsolution can be reached to the Palestinian question. We \r\nhave also qualitatively upgraded our relations with all \r\nthe major Powers.\r\nAfrica is a region with which we have historical \r\nbonds, a solidarity born out of a common struggle \r\nagainst colonialism and a belief in a future of shared \r\nprosperity. Later this month we will host the third India-\r\nAfrica Forum Summit, the first time that the leaders of \r\nall 54 African countries have been invited.\r\nAs a nuclear-weapon State, India is aware \r\nof its responsibility, and its support for global, \r\nnon-discriminatory and verifiable nuclear disarmament \r\nis undiminished.\r\nAs with nations, so it is with institutions. Only \r\nperiodic renewal can provide an organization with \r\nmeaning and purpose. In a world that continues to be \r\ndominated by wealthy and influential nations, the United \r\nNations notion of sovereign equality has permitted the \r\ndeveloping world to question some unfair norms. But \r\nit has not permitted a fundamental challenge to the \r\ninequity of a system built for a world that longer exists. \r\nIf we are to preserve the centrality and legitimacy of \r\nthe United Nations as the custodian of global peace, \r\nsecurity and development, the most urgent and pressing \r\nneed is reform of the Security Council. This is the need \r\nof the hour. How can we have a Security Council in \r\n2015 that still ref lects the geopolitical architecture \r\nof 1945? How can we have a Security Council that \r\nstill does not give Africa and Latin America seats as \r\npermanent members?\r\nWe must include more developing nations in the \r\ndecision-making structures of the Security Council. \r\nAnd we must change the way it does business by doing \r\naway with outdated and non-transparent working \r\nmethods. Giving it more legitimacy and balance would \r\nrestore its credibility and equip it to confront the \r\nchallenges of our times. We are happy that during the \r\npast year, under the leadership of Their Excellencies \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa and Mr. Courtenay Rattray, we have \r\nachieved what we had been unable to do in two decades \r\nof discussions — a text for negotiations unanimously \r\nadopted by the General Assembly as decision 69/560. \r\nThat first but critical step must be a springboard for \r\naction at this historic seventieth session.\r\nFor an organization such as the United Nations, \r\n70 years has a unique significance. It is an occasion for \r\nrevitalization and for renewal. I invite everyone in this \r\nHall to contemplate the idea of the United Nations as \r\n46/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\na banyan tree. In the eastern tradition, the banyan tree \r\nconnotes wisdom, and yet is non-judgemental and all-\r\nencompassing. It has not one trunk but many, growing \r\noutwards, each connected to the others as well as to \r\nthe sky and the earth. Its expansive branches provide \r\nshade and relief, and its base has always been a place \r\nfor discussion and debate.\r\nAt 70, unlike the men and women who might have \r\nplanted its seed, the banyan is still young. But without \r\nconstant regeneration and expansion, it withers away. \r\nThat could be the fate that awaits the United Nations. \r\nEither we can take this historic opportunity to renew this \r\ncritical institution or we can condemn it to irrelevance \r\nand tragic withering. We could easily lose ourselves \r\nin a labyrinth of our own creation, but if we seize the \r\nday, we will see a United Nations growing to its full \r\npotential, a United Nations that can reduce the gap \r\nbetween what it does and what it is capable of doing, a \r\nmighty banyan tree providing the canopy for a peaceful \r\nand prosperous humankind. I end my statement with \r\nthe hope that the United Nations will grow into such a \r\nbanyan tree.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Ramtane Lamamra, Minister of \r\nState and Minister for Foreign Affairs and International \r\nCooperation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nAlgeria.\r\nMr. Lamamra (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of Algeria, I would like to warmly congratulate \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session. \r\nI would also like express my thanks and gratitude \r\nto Mr. Sam Kutesa, the Assembly’s President at its \r\nprevious session, for the many achievements realized \r\nduring his presidency, which we hope to build on and \r\nstrengthen.\r\nThe current session coincides with the \r\ncommemoration of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\ncreation of the United Nations. It is taking place at \r\na time when the international community is facing \r\nmultiple challenges and opportunities that are the result \r\nof seven decades of profound changes and collective \r\nefforts, which have had their share of both successes \r\nand failures. Peace and stability have been restored \r\nin many parts of the world that were once ravaged by \r\ndestructive wars; people have liberated themselves \r\nfrom the yoke of colonialism in Africa, Asia and Latin \r\nAmerica; and the world has seen a qualitative leap \r\nforward and significant development in the past seven \r\ndecades. \r\nThat situation is in sharp contrast to the colonialism \r\nand foreign occupation that persist in some regions, \r\nalong with the worsening poverty and hunger that \r\nremain the biggest challenge for the United Nations \r\ntoday. There are also new threats posed by terrorism, \r\norganized crime, drug trafficking and human \r\ntrafficking. In this context, I would be remiss if I failed \r\nto mention the images that the media have brought us of \r\nthe massive influx of refugees into Europe as a result of \r\nthe war- and crisis-induced humanitarian tragedies that \r\nunquestionably denote a collective failure to deal with \r\nconflicts and their consequences in several regions, \r\nparticularly the Middle East.\r\nThe outcome document of the Summit on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda (resolution 70/1), held \r\na few days ago, has both confirmed that failure and \r\nat the same time renewed the universal commitment \r\nto tackling the challenges facing humankind on the \r\neconomic, social, security and environmental fronts, \r\nabove all the need to unite our efforts to fight poverty \r\nand take new approaches to advancing development \r\nand improving the living conditions of people, who \r\nshould be the focus of those efforts. At the same time, \r\nscarce natural resources must be safeguarded and the \r\nenvironment protected.\r\nFrom this rostrum and at this pivotal meeting, \r\nAlgeria once again affirms the validity of the purposes \r\nand principles enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations and renews its commitment to continuing to \r\nwork to ensure the triumph of the values that unite us \r\nand that have made the United Nations a mirror of the \r\nconcerns of the peoples of the world, their ambitions \r\nand hopes.\r\nI would like to stress once again the need to continue \r\nUnited Nations reform, adapting its mechanisms and \r\nmodernizing its tools, to enable it to fulfil its mission \r\nmore efficiently. It is a question, on the one hand, of \r\nreaffirming the central role of the General Assembly \r\nas the conceiver and mouthpiece of international \r\ncooperation for development and the implementation of \r\nits resolutions and approaches, and, on the other hand, \r\nof the necessary reform of the Security Council dictated \r\nby the new challenges and threats to international peace \r\nand security. This principal organ no longer mirrors \r\nthe composition of the international community, \r\nparticularly the African continent.\r\n15-29658 47/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nAlgeria is participating in this historic session \r\nhaving achieved, before the deadline, most of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals adopted at the 2000 \r\nSummit. Under the programme of the President of \r\nthe Republic, Mr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, Algeria has \r\nimplemented an ambitious development policy and \r\ndevelopment plans whose purpose is to relaunch the \r\neconomic growth and to provide for the social needs \r\nof all citizens, while continuing to strengthen the \r\nrule of law, independence of the judiciary, freedom of \r\nexpression and equal opportunity for men and women.\r\nBecause of its central location in the Maghreb and \r\nSahel areas and guided by the principles of its foreign \r\npolicy, Algeria has continued to work for peace, security \r\nand harmony in its immediate neighbourhood and to \r\nbring political and economic support to its neighbours \r\nso as to strengthen Maghreb and African integration, \r\nconvinced that this is an investment for the future of all \r\nand for the establishment of peace and stability at the \r\nregional and international levels. That is reflected in \r\nthe steady approach of the international mediation team \r\nin Mali, led by Algeria, that resulted in the conclusion \r\nof a comprehensive agreement for peace and national \r\nreconciliation. We encourage all parties signatory to \r\nthis agreement, and more generally, all political and \r\nsocial forces in Mali, and we invite the international \r\ncommunity, particularly donor countries, to endorse \r\nthis process and to back it politically and financially in \r\nan ongoing manner.\r\nAlgeria, which has stood by the fraternal \r\nLibyan people since the outbreak of the crisis in that \r\nneighbouring country, spares no effort to help it restore \r\npeace and stability and maintain its national unity. \r\nAlgeria renews its support for the efforts of the United \r\nNations in Libya to achieve an inclusive, comprehensive \r\nsolution that involves all stakeholders in Libya with a \r\nview to immediately creating a Government of national \r\naccord. \r\nIn that regard, the efforts of the African Union \r\nin conflict resolution and peacekeeping in Africa are \r\nnoteworthy. Indeed, the African Union has several \r\nachievements to its credit, with the continent contributing \r\nover 45 per cent of the world’s peacekeeping personnel. \r\nI would recall that the latest African summit, held in \r\nJohannesburg, took important decisions reflecting \r\nthe will of the countries and peoples of the continent \r\nto work towards finding African solutions to African \r\nproblems.\r\nIn Western Sahara, after a quarter century of \r\nceasefire between the two parties to the conflict, the \r\nKingdom of Morocco and the Frente Polisario, and \r\nthe adoption of the United Nations-African Settlement \r\nPlan, the Saharan people continue to live under \r\noccupation and the resultant suffering. Procrastination \r\nand attempts to f lee responsibilities are ongoing and \r\nhave prevented the achievement of a solution to this \r\nconflict, thereby undermining the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAlgeria, which supports with conviction and \r\nfirmness the right of the Saharan people to determine \r\ntheir destiny in complete freedom, appreciates the \r\nsustained efforts of the Secretary-General and his \r\nPersonal Envoy, Mr. Christopher Ross. We call on \r\nthe United Nations to set a firm date for the holding \r\nof a referendum in accordance with relevant General \r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions, as was \r\nexpressly requested by the African Summit in June \r\n2015. Algeria will spare no effort to assist the parties \r\nto the conflict and the United Nations, with a view \r\nto an early implementation of the solution for which \r\nthe fraternal Saharan people and other peoples of the \r\nMaghreb have been insistently calling.\r\nWith this same conviction of the necessity for \r\nsettling disputes by peaceful means, Algeria has \r\nbeen following with great attention and concern the \r\ndevelopments of the situations in Syria and Yemen, and \r\nthe suffering of the two fraternal peoples in those two \r\ncountries. Algeria therefore urges the protagonists to \r\ncommit resolutely to the search for a peaceful solution to \r\nthe crises in their countries. There is no other solution.\r\nAlgeria notes with satisfaction the growing global \r\nawareness of the need to fight international terrorism \r\nand to address its root causes and repercussions. That \r\nis why Algeria calls for comprehensive approaches \r\nto fighting transnational organized crime, including \r\nhuman trafficking and drug trafficking. We call for \r\ndrying up the sources of funding for terrorist groups, \r\nespecially by prohibiting and criminalizing the payment \r\nof ransoms. In this context, Algeria recently organized \r\nan international conference on deradicalization, whose \r\nrecommendations stressed the need to promote the \r\nvalues  of tolerance and moderation.\r\nAlgeria, which paid a heavy price to regain its \r\nsovereignty and rejoin the community of nations, \r\nunderstands the true value of the heroic struggle of \r\nthe Palestinian people to recover their national rights \r\n48/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nand shares their hopes as the Palestinian f lag is now \r\nflying at Headquarters for the first time. This symbolic \r\nvictory, which came after the international recognition \r\nof the Palestinian State, supports a just and definitive \r\nsolution to the Palestinian issue designed to ensure the \r\ncreation of a sovereign State, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital.\r\nGiven the importance of the issue of climate change \r\nand its impact in the economic, social and environmental \r\nspheres, and even in political and security concerns, we \r\nexpress the hope that the outcome of the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\nbe held soon in Paris, will meet the ecological challenges \r\nthat now threaten to make countries and entire regions \r\ndisappear and that seriously jeopardize life on Earth.\r\nI must also say that we need to admit that in spite \r\nof the achievements we have accomplished together \r\nat the United Nations and beyond, the instruments \r\nand procedures set up by the founding fathers seven \r\ndecades ago no longer meet the requirements of the day, \r\nnor the aspirations of the world’s population, which \r\nnow exceeds 7 billion people. In other words, the new \r\nand multiple challenges generated by globalization and \r\nthe profound changes and transformations that have \r\naffected international relations for decades demand \r\nthat we make bold reforms capable of conferring the \r\ncredibility and transparency needed by the multilateral \r\nsystem of cooperation.\r\nThe commemoration of the anniversaries \r\nof institutions, like people’s birthdays, are ideal \r\nopportunities for introspective assessments and \r\nforward-looking projections. Therefore, we harken \r\nback to the historic results of the twenty-ninth session \r\nof our Assembly, held in 1974 under the presidency of \r\nMr. Abdelaziz Bouteflika, on South Africa, Palestine \r\nand the new international economic order, to express \r\nthe hope that the current session will derive inspiration \r\nfrom that memorable time in our Organization’s life \r\nand will rise to meet the current challenges with a \r\nqualitative, collective and courageous leap forward to \r\npromote a humankind at peace with itself and free from \r\nfear and want. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Sebastian Kurz, Federal \r\nMinister for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Austria.\r\nMr. Kurz (Austria): Seventy years ago, the United \r\nNations was founded as the collective answer to war \r\nand genocide, which had cost the lives of millions of \r\npeople. The principal idea of the United Nations was \r\nto prevent war, to uphold respect for international law \r\nand human rights, and to promote social and economic \r\nprogress.\r\nI myself have not lived through even half of this \r\nperiod. Nevertheless, I believe that today, 70 years \r\nlater, we all have to ask ourselves if we have really \r\nsucceeded. We are facing a record high of over 50 \r\nviolent conflicts, stretching from Syria and Iraq to \r\nYemen, the Sudan and Somalia. We are facing a rise \r\nin radicalization and extremism. And we are facing \r\nthe highest number of refugees since the Second World \r\nWar. Nearly 60 million people worldwide are on the \r\nmove as refugees or internally displaced persons. Four \r\nmillion of them are Syrians who have left their country, \r\nf leeing from civil war and terror. Every day over 40,000 \r\npeople f lee their homes in search of peace, security or \r\na new life. This challenge is not limited to one region \r\nor to one continent. It is a global challenge. It concerns \r\nthe Mediterranean region, but also South Asia and large \r\nparts of Africa.\r\nEurope is currently also witnessing a huge f low \r\nof refugees, in particular from the wider Middle East. \r\nThese global refugee f lows pose serious problems for \r\nthe countries of origin and transit, as well as for the \r\ncountries of destination. But all affected countries and \r\nregions have one thing in common: no country and no \r\nregion can solve this crisis alone, and no single measure \r\ncan provide a solution. We need a comprehensive \r\napproach covering all the refugee routes, including \r\nthe countries of origin, transit and destination. Which \r\norganization, if not the United Nations, can provide the \r\nbasis for this collective action? Which organization, \r\nif not the United Nations, can contribute to this \r\ncomprehensive approach?\r\nIf we want to reduce the number of refugees, we \r\nhave to focus our efforts on three key areas. \r\nFirst, we have to confront the root causes in the \r\ncountries of origin: civil wars and massive human \r\nrights violations and terrorism. In this context, we \r\nhave to intensify our fight against Daesh and terrorist \r\ngroups. They must be neutralized and defeated. In the \r\ncase of Syria, it also means that we have to push harder \r\nfor a closing of ranks in the region. We will be able \r\nto achieve meaningful progress only if major regional \r\n15-29658 49/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nplayers, such as Saudi Arabia, Turkey, Egypt and Iran, \r\nact in concert. And finally, it means that we have to \r\nbring all relevant parties to the Syrian civil war to \r\nthe table, as United Nations Special Envoy Staffan de \r\nMistura is trying to do. Let me be clear: that does not \r\nmean that the current political leadership of Syria can \r\nbe part of a long-term solution. It has brought endless \r\nharm to the people of Syria. But if one wants to make \r\npeace, one does not talk only to one’s friends.\r\nThe second point is that we need more unity at \r\nthe international level. Huge efforts have already been \r\nmade, but the United Nations and its Member States \r\ncan and should do more. We will be able to make a \r\ndifference only if we make it possible for the United \r\nStates and Russia to pull in one direction. The Security \r\nCouncil has to demonstrate unity.\r\nWe need a mandate not only for action against \r\nDaesh, but also for the protection of civilians. It should \r\ninclude the establishment of safe zones and buffer \r\nzones, which would increase people’s security and \r\nmake access to humanitarian aid much easier. Action \r\nby the Security Council would also make it possible for \r\nmany countries to have the opportunity to join in and \r\noffer their support. Our position is clear: Austria would \r\nstand ready to contribute to such a United Nations \r\npeace operation.\r\nThirdly, we need a change of system. A system that \r\nallows only the fittest or those rich enough to pay the \r\nsmugglers to reach a safe haven like Europe is wrong. \r\nThe current system is in fact indirectly sponsoring \r\nsmugglers. Since 2000 more than 24,000 migrants \r\nand refugees have died on their way to Europe. The \r\npictures of refugees drowned in the Mediterranean Sea \r\nor suffocated in trucks will continue to haunt us. We \r\ntherefore need a change of system. We need to create \r\nthe possibility for refugees to apply for asylum in their \r\ncountries of origin or neighbouring countries. The \r\nUnited Nations could help in the establishment of such \r\nreception and information centres, which would allow \r\nresettlement programmes to be introduced.\r\nIn my opinion, trafficking in human beings is one \r\nof the worst crimes. We should consider systematic and \r\nlarge-scale smuggling a crime against humanity, so that \r\nthe perpetrators can finally be brought to justice.\r\nThere is another crisis area we should not forget \r\nabout. Last year, like most of those present, I referred \r\nto the Russian-Ukrainian conflict as probably the most \r\nserious challenge to peace and security in Europe \r\n(see A/69/PV.15). One year later, we still do not see \r\nenough positive development. The conflict is ongoing, \r\nthe number of deaths has even increased, and the \r\nsocioeconomic consequences are huge.\r\nThere is only one way ahead: a peaceful settlement \r\nbased on dialogue and negotiation. We must find a \r\nsolution that provides for a free and stable Ukraine \r\nenjoying strong ties with both the European Union \r\nand the Russian Federation. In this respect the Minsk \r\nagreement is and remains the only option on the \r\ntable. There is no alternative to implementing that \r\nagreement. All parties have to live up to their \r\ncommitments. In that context, let me underline \r\nthe crucial work the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE) is doing. The Special \r\nMonitoring Mission and the Trilateral Contact Group \r\nplay a unique role for a peaceful settlement. The OSCE \r\ndeserves our full support, and Austria will do its utmost \r\nto contribute to its work, especially during our OSCE \r\nchairmanship in 2017. \r\nAll these conflicts show that 70 years after its \r\nestablishment, we need the United Nations more than \r\never. However, in some areas the United Nations is \r\npushed to its breaking point. It urgently needs to be \r\nreformed in order to be prepared for the future. Which \r\nis the way forward? \r\nFirst, we have to remind ourselves of the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe Charter is and remains our backbone. Failure is \r\nguaranteed if we do not respect it. \r\nSecondly, we have to look at the functioning of \r\nthe main bodies. We need a Security Council that is \r\nunited and can act swiftly. We therefore welcome the \r\nefforts to improve the Council’s work, and we support \r\nthe initiatives to suspend the use of the veto in cases \r\nof mass atrocities. In order to be able to address global \r\nchallenges, we all need a United Nations that is capable \r\nof taking action and a Security Council that is more \r\nrepresentative, accountable and transparent.\r\nWe highly value the fact that one of the headquarters \r\nof the United Nations is in Vienna, and we will continue \r\nto support it actively. We remain committed to act as a \r\nplace for international dialogue, such as the Iran nuclear \r\ntalks that took place in Vienna this year. \r\nWe will also continue to contribute to all diplomatic \r\ninitiatives for a better world. In this sense, one key area \r\nfor us is nuclear disarmament. The Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\n50/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nNuclear Weapons last May failed to reach an agreement, \r\nbut there is growing international momentum on \r\nnuclear disarmament and non-proliferation. At that \r\nConference, I delivered a joint statement on the \r\nhumanitarian consequences of nuclear weapons on \r\nbehalf of 159 States. And the Vienna Conference on \r\nthe Humanitarian Impact of Nuclear Weapons last \r\nDecember resulted in a humanitarian pledge, which \r\nhas been endorsed by 116 States. Austria, together with \r\nother sponsors, will submit several draft resolutions on \r\nthe humanitarian initiative, and we hope that they will \r\nreceive broad support. \r\nSeventy years after Hiroshima and Nagasaki, \r\nnuclear weapons still pose one of the most serious \r\nthreats to humankind. I can assure the Assembly that \r\nAustria will fight for a world free of nuclear weapons \r\nto make our world a safer place.\r\nThe global challenges we are facing require a \r\nstrong United Nations. We therefore thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for all his work. I can assure the \r\nAssembly that Austria will remain committed to the \r\nUnited Nations and to our Secretary-General. They can \r\ncontinue to count on our continuous support.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Charles Flanagan, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Trade of Ireland.\r\nMr. Flanagan (Ireland): It is a great honour for \r\nme to address the General Assembly this afternoon \r\non behalf of Ireland on the sixtieth anniversary of my \r\ncountry’s joining the United Nations and the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations itself. \r\nAt the intersection of these two special anniversaries, \r\nit has been a great privilege for Ireland to have \r\nco-facilitated the final negotiations of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), the implementation of \r\nwhich is critical for the future of our planet and its \r\npeople.\r\nThe SDGs are a tangible manifestation of the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to deliver positive \r\noutcomes in the most challenging circumstances, but \r\nwe cannot be complacent. On the contrary, in this \r\nanniversary year, we must critically appraise our \r\nfailures, as the international community, to prevent war, \r\ngenocide, forced displacement and deprivation. Today \r\nwe face unprecedented challenges in confronting the \r\nsavage violence of well-resourced non-State actors, as \r\nwell as of some States, with consequential humanitarian \r\ncatastrophes unfolding in many parts of the world. \r\nStrong and assertive leadership by the United Nations \r\nhas never been as critical. I know the United Nations \r\nand its Members can live up to this great challenge.\r\nIn our 60 years at the United Nations, Ireland has \r\npursued a series of policy priorities that continue to be \r\ncentral to our foreign policy. They include peacekeeping, \r\nnon-proliferation and nuclear disarmament, \r\ndevelopment aid, promoting peace and security while \r\nwe were on the Security Council, and advancing gender \r\nequality. I will touch upon these policies and outline \r\ntheir continuing relevance for Ireland today.\r\nIn the 1950s, when Ireland joined the United \r\nNations, our then Prime Minister, John A. Costello, \r\nidentified our goal as playing “our part to secure what \r\nsmall nations have always required, the maintenance of \r\npeace”. We are extremely proud that the loyal service of \r\nIrish peacekeepers has been central to our negotiations \r\nwith the United Nations since 1958. On 12 occasions \r\nour soldiers have led United Nations missions. There \r\nare currently 370 committed and courageous Irish \r\npeacekeeping troops serving in seven United Nations \r\nmissions; 87 Irish peacekeepers have tragically lost \r\ntheir lives in the active service of the United Nations.\r\nIreland feels a strong sense of responsibility to \r\nprotect the reputation and honour of United Nations \r\npeacekeepers. We owe this to our peacekeeping troops, \r\npast, present and future. And so, like Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, we received reports of sexual \r\nabuse involving some United Nations peacekeepers \r\nwith shock and outrage.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping missions must never \r\nbe associated with exploitation because of the actions \r\nof a few. Ireland will always speak out to defend the \r\nvulnerable. We will not be silent about the plight \r\nof women and children harmed by the very people \r\nresponsible for their protection. Those serving under the \r\nUnited Nations f lag have a fundamental responsibility \r\nto behave in an honourable way and to be a force for \r\ngood in this world. \r\nIreland demands decisive action in confronting any \r\ncriminal behaviour by United Nations troops. This is \r\nvital to protect the good name of the United Nations and \r\nits peacekeepers, the overwhelming majority of whom \r\nare principled people. We want appropriate training, \r\nclear accountability and strict sanctions. I welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s commitment to making the United \r\nNations firm zero-tolerance policy into an effective \r\nzero-crime reality.\r\n15-29658 51/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping and Ireland’s \r\ncontribution have adapted in scale and complexity \r\nto challenges over the past six decades. Continuing \r\nf lexibility and innovation are essential. I therefore \r\nwelcome the report of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations and its comprehensive analysis \r\nof the challenges ahead and the changes required \r\n(A/70/95). In particular, our own experience of conflict \r\nin Ireland has taught us that full and equal participation \r\nby women in decisions around peace and security are \r\nvital to building a sustainable peace.\r\nI now turn to the 1960s. From our earliest days \r\nat the United Nations, Ireland has been passionately \r\ncommitted to disarmament and non-proliferation. As \r\nthe first State to sign the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) in 1968, following several \r\nyears work as initiator of the General Assembly \r\nresolutions that led to its agreement, we have a deep \r\nand abiding commitment to the full implementation \r\nof the Treaty. Indeed, significant progress has been \r\nmade on non-proliferation. We warmly welcome the \r\nagreement reached with Iran and look forward to its \r\nimplementation. More broadly, we hope that this will \r\nalso mark the opening of a new and constructive chapter \r\nin Iran’s engagement in the international system. \r\nConversely, the outcome of the 2015 NPT Review \r\nConference in May was deeply disappointing. States \r\nwith nuclear arsenals have special responsibilities, and \r\nIreland will continue to press them to deliver on their \r\ncommitments under the NPT.\r\nToday there are at least 17,000 nuclear weapons \r\nposing a threat to our very survival. We cannot accept \r\nthat status quo. Ireland wants real momentum injected \r\ninto the nuclear disarmament pillar of the NPT. The \r\nSDG negotiation process underscored the very positive \r\nrole that civic society groups and people around the \r\nworld can play. Ireland would like to see that positivity, \r\ninclusivity and urgency in the nuclear disarmament \r\ndebate.\r\nWe see the daily consequences of illegal and \r\nirresponsible f lows of arms and conventional weapons \r\nin the appalling scenes of chaos and brutality into \r\nwhich parts of our world have descended. The scenes \r\nin our newspapers and on our television and computer \r\nscreens are truly horrific. People wonder what can be \r\ndone to stem this industrial-scale violence. \r\nPart of the solution is the Arms Trade Treaty, one \r\nof the international community’s most significant \r\nachievements in recent years. Ireland was one of the \r\nfirst States to ratify the Treaty, and we have offered \r\nfinancial support to enable wider participation in \r\nnegotiations and more effective implementation. \r\nThe onus is now on all States parties to maintain the \r\nimmense and sustained effort we put into negotiating \r\nthe Treaty. We must ensure that we live up to its great \r\npromise, with the ultimate goal of enhancing peace and \r\nsecurity and thereby saving lives.\r\nNow to the 1970s. In 1974, having acceded to the \r\nEuropean Union the previous year, Ireland established \r\nits programme of overseas development cooperation, \r\nIrish Aid. Since then Ireland has provided over \r\n$13 billion in support of the world’s most impoverished \r\npeople and has championed the aid agenda within the \r\nEuropean Union, which is the world’s largest provider \r\nof development assistance.\r\nLast week at Headquarters, world leaders adopted \r\nthe new Sustainable Development Goals for the \r\nperiod up to 2030. We have committed ourselves to an \r\nambitious programme and transformational agenda to \r\nend extreme poverty, to preserve the planet for this and \r\nfuture generations and to create conditions for balanced \r\neconomic growth throughout the world. Reaching \r\nagreement on these Goals is one of the most important \r\nachievements of the United Nations in recent years. It \r\nwas an enormous challenge, and we, the 193 Member \r\nStates, rose to it. That was multilateral diplomacy at \r\nits best.\r\nThe United Nations has demonstrated its continuing \r\nrelevance and, indeed, indispensability. I am proud \r\nthat Ireland was able to make its contribution through \r\nthe co-facilitator role played by Ambassador David \r\nDonoghue and his team in the negotiations which, \r\nworking with Kenya, brought about this landmark \r\nagreement. Moving to successful implementation of this \r\nhuge global agenda will be the next great challenge. We \r\ndo not underestimate the challenges for all countries in \r\nimplementing a universal agenda that is as broad and \r\ndiverse as the new SDGs, but we cannot underestimate \r\nthe huge achievement and benefits for humankind if it \r\nis successfully implemented.\r\nOur development gains are threatened by the \r\nunprecedented scale of humanitarian crises facing our \r\nworld. The total number of refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced people worldwide has now surpassed \r\n50 million people. In Europe, we have clearly seen \r\nthe tragic consequences for those who, driven by \r\ndesperation, are taking inconceivable risks to find a \r\nsafe haven for their families. Addressing the migration \r\n52/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\ncrisis is a huge challenge for Europe and one that we \r\nare working hard to resolve. People are f leeing their \r\nhome countries for a multiplicity of reasons. They are \r\narriving in Europe from a multiplicity of routes. They \r\nundertake perilous journeys, often exploited by ruthless \r\ncriminals along the way. This is a disaster that requires \r\nthe close collaboration of the international community. \r\nThe United Nations is undertaking vital work in \r\nseeking to address the root causes of mass migration and \r\nto provide humanitarian assistance to those who have \r\nbeen driven from their homes by the ravages of war. \r\nI urge States to work with the Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General on Migration — an Irishman, \r\nPeter Sutherland, who is dedicating himself to assisting \r\nin the resolution of this global catastrophe. Ireland \r\nsupports the humanitarian effort by providing crucial \r\nfunding and other resources. We have deployed \r\nsearch-and-rescue ships to the Mediterranean. We are \r\nproviding for the resettlement of over 4,000 refugees.\r\nIreland welcomes the Secretary-General’s setting \r\nup of the High-Level Panel on Humanitarian Financing \r\nto address the growing gap between humanitarian \r\nneeds and resources. We will participate fully in \r\nthat and other processes leading to next year’s World \r\nHumanitarian Summit.\r\nIn the 1980s, Ireland completed its first full term on \r\nthe Security Council, motivated by its commitment to \r\nmultilateralism and a rules-based international system. \r\nThese values are under grave threat today. Russia’s \r\nunlawful annexation of Crimea and the conflict in \r\neastern Ukraine have had profound implications for \r\nthe people of Ukraine and for the international system \r\nitself. Ireland calls on all sides to respect and fully \r\nimplement the Minsk agreements and to cooperate \r\nwith the peacebuilding efforts of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe in the region. \r\nDuring our first term on the Security Council in \r\n1981 and 1982, the Middle East was, as ever, prominent \r\non the international agenda. Today, challenges in the \r\nregion are even greater. In Syria, over 200,000 people \r\nhave lost their lives and over 11 million people have \r\nbeen displaced. The Al-Assad regime continues to \r\nf lout international law, while the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Levant (ISIL) inflicts gratuitous cruelty and \r\nsuffering on the people of Syria and northern Iraq. Its \r\ncasual barbarism is a threat to every value the United \r\nNations holds dear, and therefore the United Nations \r\nhas a duty to act.\r\nElsewhere in the region, Ireland remains concerned \r\nat the continued stalemate in the Middle East peace \r\nprocess. We are strong advocates of the two-State \r\nsolution as the only way to achieve a just and lasting \r\npeace for the Israeli and Palestinian peoples.\r\nIn our pursuit of peace on the island of Ireland, \r\nwe were, and continue to be, supported by steadfast \r\npartners who stayed the course with us through \r\nmany difficult years, keeping faith where others saw \r\nhopelessness. In our wide-ranging work on conflict \r\nprevention, mediation and State-building, we seek to \r\nshare our experience. We hope to bring this to the table \r\nwhen we seek election to the Security Council again in \r\n2020.\r\nI turn to the 1990s. Historically, Ireland has \r\nsupported the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights, from our early support for decolonization to our \r\nopposition to apartheid in South Africa and through \r\nto our election to the Human Rights Council for the \r\nterm 2013 to 2015. In 1997, our former President, Mary \r\nRobinson, was appointed the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights. At the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Ireland has sought to give concrete expression \r\nto the long-held convictions that have informed \r\nour positions within the United Nations. We have \r\nchampioned resolutions to promote and protect civil \r\nsociety space, which we recognize as essential to make \r\nother rights attainable. We advocate for the critical role \r\nof human rights defenders. We have led initiatives to \r\nprevent the morbidity and mortality of children under 5.\r\nIn Ireland, there is widespread concern about \r\nviolent repression and terrorist attacks on religious \r\nminorities. We have seen an alarming rise in attacks \r\non Christians, Baha’i, Jews and Muslims. Elsewhere \r\npeople are oppressed and punished because of their \r\ngender, race or sexual orientation. In short, vulnerable \r\nminorities are under increasing attack from repressive \r\nState regimes and from transnational terrorist networks \r\nincluding ISIL, Al-Qaida, Boko Haram and others. The \r\nUnited Nations, as a champion of equality, plurality and \r\ndiversity, has an important role to play in defending \r\nand protecting vulnerable groups. We fully support the \r\nOrganization in this essential task. \r\nThis year Ireland became the first country in \r\nthe world to legalize marriage equality by a popular \r\nvote. This has been a hugely positive experience for \r\nIreland, and we urge other States to follow suit and to \r\npromote rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender \r\n15-29658 53/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nand intersex citizens. Similarly, Ireland has had its own \r\nhistoric experience of religious repression; therefore, \r\nreligious freedom is a matter of great importance to my \r\ncountry.\r\nTurning to the 2000s, I wish to emphasize Ireland’s \r\ngrave concern for vulnerable women and girls in \r\nmany parts of the world and our strong commitment \r\nto gender equality. In the year 2000, just before our \r\nlast membership of the Security Council, Ireland \r\nco-sponsored resolution 1325 (2000), on women and \r\npeace and security, reflecting our strong national \r\ncommitment to this agenda. I hope that Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon may be succeeded by a brilliant \r\nfemale Secretary-General in due course, because that \r\nwould send a powerful message to women and men \r\nthroughout the world that here, in the United Nations, \r\nwe are willing to remove the barriers that prevent \r\nwomen from fulfilling their true potential.\r\nWe strongly endorse the code of conduct on Security \r\nCouncil action on mass atrocity crimes, developed by \r\nLiechtenstein and the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency group, and we support the declaration by \r\nFrance and Mexico on regulating the use of the veto. \r\nIreland is ready for membership in 2021 of a much \r\nreformed and more representative Security Council, \r\none that is better equipped to respond to twenty-first \r\n-century threats to international peace and security.\r\nRealizing the United Nations core values in every \r\nMember State will mean a fairer, more prosperous and \r\nsustainable world for this generation and all those who \r\ncome after. I wish to conclude with the words of the late \r\nIrish poet Seamus Heaney, “I have begun to think of \r\nlife as a series of ripples widening out from an original \r\ncentre”.\r\nIn 2015, a very special anniversary year for us all, \r\nit is time to reflect on our own original centre — the \r\nUnited Nations Charter — and for all 193 Member \r\nStates to recommit ourselves to delivering on its great \r\npromise: a peaceful, just and prosperous world.\r\nMr. Alrowaiei (Bahrain), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call \r\non His Excellency Moussa Faki Mahamat, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and African Integration of the Republic \r\nof Chad.\r\nMr. Mahamat (Chad) (spoke in French): Fifteen \r\nyears ago, we welcomed unanimously the adoption of \r\nthe Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2) and the \r\nMillennium Development Goals as the appropriate \r\nresponse to the poverty-related problems facing many \r\nof our countries. With the adoption of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment Agenda (resolution 70/1), the General \r\nAssembly, at its seventieth session, has once again \r\nreaffirmed States’ determination to fight poverty by \r\nseeking new ways and means of promoting development. \r\nThe success of the implementation of the Agenda \r\nwill require suitable joint responses to the numerous \r\nchallenges facing the world.\r\nFor many African countries, success in this \r\nendeavour will hinge on their security situation and their \r\nability to finance their development plans and strategies. \r\nOn a daily basis they face challenges that include \r\nterrorism and a drop in export prices. The successful \r\nimplementation of this new development Agenda will \r\nalso depend on the solidarity of developed countries \r\ntowards developing countries in terms of effective \r\nfinancing. That is why we have high expectations that \r\nthe conclusions of the third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development, held in Addis Ababa, \r\nwill be translated into reality.\r\nThe theme of this session, “The United Nations \r\nat 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human \r\nrights”, means that we should place at the very heart of \r\nour general debate the issue of resolving the challenges \r\nthat our Organization currently faces, the most \r\nintractable of which include armed conflicts, terrorism \r\nand migration. There is no doubt that Africa is one \r\nof the epicentres in that respect, given the multiple \r\ntragedies taking place there.\r\nIn the Central African Republic, for example, \r\nthe particularly bloody clashes of recent days are \r\njeopardizing the few hard-won victories achieved \r\nduring the transition. The international community \r\nmust not throw in the towel and must help the country \r\nemerge from this phase by providing it with the \r\nnecessary budgetary support to hold elections within \r\nthe set time frame.\r\nIn the Lake Chad basin, the terrorist activities \r\nbeing carried out virtually on a daily basis by the \r\nterrorist group Boko Haram against the countries of the \r\nsubregion have not ceased despite considerable losses it \r\nsuffered during the military operations carried out by \r\na coalition of those countries’ armies. A multinational \r\njoint task force has been set up by the countries members \r\nof the Lake Chad Basin Commission in order to put an \r\nend to the abuses committed by that nefarious group. \r\n54/55 15-29658\r\nA/70/PV.22 01/10/2015\r\nWe remain confident that, with the intensification of \r\nthis military cooperation, we will be able to once and \r\nfor all eradicate this evil terrorist group. We also expect \r\nthe United Nations and all of our partners to provide \r\nmaterial, financial and logistical support to that force.\r\nAside from military action, these countries have \r\ndecided to adopt an emergency development programme \r\nto help the most vulnerable populations fight against \r\nthe deep-seated causes of insecurity, which are linked \r\nto poverty. This initiative, which originated in the Lake \r\nChad Basin Commission, is a game-changer in terms of \r\nthe peace and security efforts in the region and merits \r\nour support.\r\nIn Mali, the peace agreements signed recently in \r\nAlgiers, which are aimed at transforming that country \r\nback into the haven of peace and tolerance that it had \r\nalways been, are being put seriously to the test by \r\narmed groups, despite the presence of international \r\nforces. Chad calls on all parties to show wisdom and \r\nto respect their commitments in implementing the \r\naforementioned agreements.\r\nIn Libya, the presence of a number of elements linked \r\nto the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant continues \r\nto contribute to the collapse of that country and is an \r\nadditional source of concern and even destabilization \r\nfor Africa as a whole and in particular for neighbouring \r\ncountries, including Chad. We urgently call for an end to \r\nthe violence and for the establishment of a Government \r\nof national unity.\r\nIn South Sudan, Chad is working actively alongside \r\na number of African countries to end the fratricidal \r\nwar taking place there. Political actors must make \r\nevery effort to concentrate solely on building their \r\nyoung State. The Intergovernmental Authority on \r\nDevelopment and the ad hoc committee tasked with \r\nsupporting it in mediation must continue to stand firm \r\nand act cohesively so as to achieve a lasting solution to \r\nthis terrifying crisis.\r\nIn the Sudan, we support the holding of the national \r\ndialogue planned for next month, and we call upon the \r\npolitical class as a whole and all armed groups to take \r\npart in the process.\r\nThe majority of African crises are born of or fuelled \r\nby underdevelopment. That is why several initiatives \r\nhave been launched, including the 2013 United Nations \r\nIntegrated Strategy for the Sahel, that have given rise to \r\ngreat hopes for the countries of the region, confronted \r\nas they are with the dual challenge of insecurity and \r\nunderdevelopment. It is regrettable, however, that the \r\nannouncements made in the context of the Strategy are \r\ntaking a long time to be translated into reality.\r\nTurning to the rest of the world, the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict remains unresolved, prolonging \r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian people and intensifying \r\nrancour on all sides. It is high time to overcome the \r\npsychological obstacles by promoting the creation of \r\na viable Palestinian State living in peace side by side \r\nwith Israel. The raising yesterday of the Palestinian \r\nf lag within the United Nations compound is, we hope, \r\nan important step towards finding a peaceful solution \r\nto this conflict, which is as old as our Organization.\r\nIn addition to this endless conflict, we are \r\nwitnessing particularly violent crises in Iraq, Syria \r\nand Yemen. The international community must make \r\nevery effort to help these countries overcome these \r\ntragedies, whose repercussions are being felt not only \r\nin the Middle East but also in the rest of the world. \r\nInternational peace and security are under serious \r\nthreat from what is now happening in that part of the \r\nworld. Religious radicalism and terrorism have found \r\nextremely fertile ground for their expansion.\r\nThe crisis situations that we have just described have \r\ngreatly contributed to the upsurge in terrorism and the \r\nformation of criminal groups of all stripes. Terrorism, \r\nwhich spares no continent and no community, is \r\nfast becoming a global scourge. The acts of extreme \r\nviolence committed against peaceful populations under \r\nreligious or doctrinaire pretexts run counter to the \r\nprinciples of international law and human rights as well \r\nas religious principles.\r\nIn Africa, States grappling with terrorism are \r\nbeing forced to spend the lion’s share of their resources \r\non security instead of on economic and social \r\ndevelopment. My country, Chad, is in this situation.\r\nWe recently fell prey to that scourge with the death of \r\naround 100 persons assassinated in terrorist attacks in \r\nthe capital and on the islands of Lake Chad. Chad is \r\ntherefore paying for its involvement against terrorist \r\ngroups in Mali and Nigeria, on whom it inflicted heavy \r\nlosses, but Chad not will yield. It will continue to hunt \r\ndown those terrorist groups relentlessly. All we ask \r\nfrom our partners is that they give us robust support, \r\nboth technical and material, to enable us to provide the \r\nresponse needed in this faceless war. \r\nThe capacity of terrorists and extremist groups \r\nfor transborder harm requires a collective and nimble \r\n15-29658 55/55\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.22\r\nresponse. The way to fight terrorism together is to \r\npool our resources and our response strategies through \r\nintensifying regional and international cooperation. In \r\nthat connection, we propose that 2016 be declared the \r\nYear of Fighting Terrorism. It would be an opportunity \r\nto think seriously about the deep-seated causes of that \r\nphenomenon, the ways and means to contain it and to \r\neliminate it in the long term.\r\nThe increase in the number and seriousness of \r\ncrises has also created a phenomenon whose scale is \r\nunprecedented in the world: migration. Indeed, for \r\nsome months now, the world has been witnessing an \r\nunexpected expansion of international migration. Those \r\nconsequences are tragic for hundreds of thousands of \r\nwomen and children desperately seeking a better life. \r\nThe international community will be able to put an \r\nend to this migration only if appropriate solutions are \r\nfound to its origins and underlying causes, particularly \r\nin resolving conflicts and eradicating poverty in the \r\ncountries of origin.\r\nWe also need to find solutions for the thousands of \r\nrefugees and persons displaced throughout the world. \r\nThey also need our help. Chad is the African country \r\nwith the second-largest number of refugees, returnees \r\nand displaced persons on its territory, estimated at over \r\n500,000. They come from the regions bordering Chad, \r\nparticularly Sudanese Darfur, the Central African \r\nRepublic, Nigeria and Libya. They live in difficult \r\nenvironmental and humanitarian conditions.\r\nOnce again, I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto thank all friendly countries and especially \r\nthe Secretariat’s Office for the Coordination \r\nof Humanitarian Affairs and the International \r\nOrganization for Migration for their support to those \r\nin need and for the advocacy they do for our country.\r\nOur world has been facing an insidious threat for \r\nsome time now — climate change. That will be dealt \r\nwith at a major conference in Paris next month. Chad \r\nwill actively be present at that conference because \r\nit is one of the major victims of degradation due to \r\nclimate change. We are a Sahelian country threatened \r\nby drought and desertification, and we are powerless \r\nin the face of the progressive drying up of Lake Chad. \r\nWe strongly hope that the negotiations will lead to an \r\nagreement and give us some hope that we can save our \r\nplanet, including the imperilled Lake Chad.\r\nThe celebration of the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations also coincides with a very happy \r\nevent, namely, the normalization of relations between \r\nthe United States of America and Cuba, which Chad \r\nwelcomes. We commend the courage shown by the \r\nleaders of those two countries to achieve that outcome. \r\nWe urge them to continue their constructive dialogue \r\nuntil we see a complete and definitive lifting of the \r\nembargo that Cuba has unjustly suffered for decades, \r\nwhich will enable that country to recover the place it \r\nmerits in the concert of nations.\r\nBefore concluding my remarks, the delegation of \r\nChad would like to congratulate the President on his \r\nelection and thank his predecessor for his remarkable \r\nwork. We also pay tribute to the Secretary-General of \r\nour Organization for his personal and steady investment \r\nin the search for peace and security in the world.\r\nI hope that this general debate will be crowned with \r\nsuccess and, above all, that we will become much more \r\naware of our individual and collective responsibilities. \r\nWe also hope that it guides humanity to peace, security, \r\nstability and prosperity.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.25 p.m.\r\n"
