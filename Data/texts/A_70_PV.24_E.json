I would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa, President of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session, for his stewardship during the past year.\r\nIt is an honour and a privilege to address this \r\ngathering today. On behalf of the people and Government \r\nof the Federal Republic of Somalia, I would like to offer \r\nour warm congratulations to the Organization on the \r\noccasion of the seventieth anniversary of its foundation. \r\nOver the past seven decades, the principled goals of the \r\nUnited Nations — furthering peace, protecting security \r\nand ensuring the advancement of human rights — have \r\nbecome unifying pillars for our global community. \r\nSomalia was one of the earliest African members of \r\nthe United Nations and has remained one for more than \r\n55 years. We have watched it grow, we have matured \r\nunder its tutelage, and we have now climbed back \r\nfrom a difficult phase in our recent history, thankful \r\nfor the support and backing of the Members of the \r\nOrganization.\r\nTwenty-five years ago, Somalia experienced its \r\nown Arab Spring, ahead of the current phenomenon that \r\nhas swept through much of the Arab world in the past \r\nfew years. We have seen what can happen if a society’s \r\npolitical demands are not adequately addressed, and \r\nwe have had to learn some all too difficult lessons \r\nthroughout two challenging decades. That is why it \r\npains us greatly to see our fellow Arab and Muslim \r\ncountries going down a very similar difficult road. \r\nBut it must be said that, thanks to perseverance \r\nand togetherness, Somalia has become an example \r\nof what can be accomplished in such times. We are a \r\nnation that intimately understands those famous words \r\nof American President John F. Kennedy, who said: \r\n“Mankind must put an end to war, or war will put an end \r\nto mankind” (A/PV.1013, para. 40). The theme of this \r\nyear’s session — peace, security and human rights — is \r\nin line with my Government’s vision. Indeed, a new \r\nSomalia is taking shape, and we intend to continue our \r\nclimb out of the dark.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.24\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n24th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 1 October 2015, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nI want to talk about Somalia, but a Somalia different \r\nfrom the one many here may have heard of. I am not \r\nhere to deny our notoriety, the result of a conflict \r\nthat has spanned two and half decades, but I would \r\nlike to introduce another reality. Somalia is home to \r\na proud and industrious people. Despite adversity, \r\nwe have become athletes, economists, authors, poets, \r\nmusicians, entrepreneurs and innovators who lead the \r\nworld. Even without a Government, our businesses kept \r\nfunctioning. We remain a major player in the regional \r\nlivestock trade and have one of the most innovative \r\ntelecommunications sectors in Africa. My people are \r\nambitious and generous. During the famine, we gave \r\nmore than all the aid agencies combined.\r\nWe have built banking systems based on social \r\ncapital and trust, invaluable networks that have \r\nattracted a range of investors. We are survivors, and, \r\ngiven the chance, we can move the socioeconomic \r\nlandscape of East Africa forward. Imagine the potential \r\nin the fact that we have one of the longest shorelines in \r\nthe world, hosting untapped oil and gas reserves. We \r\nare actively rebuilding our country in order to realize \r\nthat potential. We must be humble. Progress is slow, but \r\nwe must remember where we have come from. The civil \r\nwar destroyed our infrastructure and institutions, and \r\ntook away some of our brightest minds. Now, however, \r\nthey are coming back, and together, we are moving \r\nforward. We have defeated piracy, we are embracing \r\ndecentralization and, most importantly, we are learning \r\nlessons from our past.\r\nThe United Nations has been there with us during \r\nthat remarkable journey, and we are grateful. My \r\nGovernment has a vision, which is to rebuild State \r\ninstitutions. Considerable progress has been made \r\ntowards our Vision 2016 strategy. Three new interim \r\nregional States have been formed. We are consulting our \r\npeople on how best to hold free, democratic elections, \r\nand we have established constitutionally mandated \r\ncommissions to ensure accountability.\r\nAllow me to elaborate on a few critical issues. \r\nFirst, we must ensure free and fair elections. For that \r\nto succeed, we and our constituents must agree on a \r\nfair and transparent voting system and how that system \r\ncan be extended to each region. Only through inclusion \r\nwill we draw public support. I should recall here that \r\nSomalia was the first country in Africa in which a \r\ndemocratically elected president lost an election and \r\ngracefully transferred power. That history must define \r\nour future.\r\nWe must also prioritize our national security forces. \r\nThere is still an active insurgency that we are risking \r\nour lives to dismantle, for our own safety and for the \r\nsecurity of our region. Last year, together with African \r\nUnion forces, we liberated all our major regions from \r\nAl-Shabaab. But our soldiers are underpaid, underfed \r\nand underequipped and yet are expected to put their \r\nlives on the line for their country. That is unacceptable. \r\nWe must invest in professionalizing our security and \r\npolice forces. Peacekeeping missions work best when \r\nthey have clear objectives and timelines, both for \r\nrestoring stability and for building the capacity of \r\nnational security forces.\r\nI would like to ask everyone here to join me in \r\npaying tribute to all those who have helped liberate us \r\nfrom violence, many of whom have made the ultimate \r\nsacrifice. Our women — mothers, daughters and \r\nsisters — also deserve limitless praise for enduring the \r\nworst of our brutal conflict. The survival instincts of \r\nthe Somali people are most evident in its women. They \r\nraise families while their homes are being bombed, \r\nwalk miles without water in search of safety, and bury \r\ntheir children while continuing to work to feed the rest \r\nof their families. We know what war can do. And that \r\nis why I, as a father and a husband, will ensure that we \r\nwill defeat terrorism. It is our duty as a Government.\r\nAnother issue of great importance is the problem \r\nof Somali refugees and undocumented migrants still \r\nliving in temporary camps, some for more than two and \r\na half decades. We are grateful to the countries in the \r\nregion that have helped and hosted our people, but we \r\nrecognize that many of the refugees continue to live \r\nin perpetual crisis, without any hope of resettlement, \r\nresidency or citizenship. That is unacceptable. We urge \r\nour friends here in the Assembly to work with us to find \r\na durable solution. The transition will not be easy, but \r\nmillions of lives depend on it.\r\nUltimately, we must enable the rebuilding of \r\nState institutions and infrastructure. Effective and \r\ntransparent institutions are a prerequisite for providing \r\nservices. Somalia lacks completely, or has in very short \r\nsupply, the public services that many people around \r\nthe world take for granted. For the past two and half \r\ndecades, public services, including schools, water and \r\npower, have been run by private companies. It is critical \r\nthat all Somalis feel they have a stake and a role in the \r\nGovernment. The country’s residents have the right to \r\ndemand services of us. If we fail to provide them, we \r\nrisk falling short of their expectations. \r\n15-29876 3/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nAs I stand here today, I am proposing a grand \r\ndevelopment plan for Somalia. It will focus on rebuilding \r\nour social and physical infrastructure — roads, schools, \r\nhospitals, community centres, ports, airports and \r\nmarkets, all of which are essential if we are to revive \r\nthe State and the economy. The plan, which is aligned \r\nto the new Sustainable Development Goals, will help to \r\nminimize duplication of effort and empower Somalis to \r\nkeep building their own future.\r\nThe bulk of our population is under the age of 30. \r\nThey are the future of our nation. It is from them that \r\nwe are borrowing today’s resources and to them that \r\npeace will pay its ultimate dividend. We must find a \r\nplace for them in leadership, and we must create jobs \r\nand opportunities for them. They need the kind of \r\nopportunities and challenges that drive all young people \r\naround the world to try to succeed. We need to provide \r\nincentives for them, so that they have a choice and can \r\nleave extremism behind. That grand development plan \r\nfor Somalia, akin to a Somali Marshall Plan, can create \r\ncountless opportunities for our young people to invest \r\nin their own future.\r\nBillions in taxpayers’ money has been pumped \r\ninto Somalia, and we have had some successes, but not \r\nenough. Non-governmental organizations have become \r\na local business; some are effective, others are not. We \r\nneed a different approach now. We do not want charity; \r\nwe want direct investment. We need to build quality \r\nschools and fill them with quality educators. We need \r\nto pave roads, build markets and rejuvenate agricultural \r\nproduction so as to make us East Africa’s largest \r\nexporter of quality produce once again. Our New Deal \r\nis a useful aid framework, but we must translate it into \r\nresults. And it is about time. Somalia’s development plan \r\nwill ensure accountability and transparency for every \r\ninvestment made. Every United Nations Member State \r\nwill have the opportunity to help Somalia evolve into \r\nan economic powerhouse and a future trading partner, \r\nand we will share the plan with all in due course.\r\nWe are grateful to the Members of the United \r\nNations for supporting us over the past two and half \r\ndecades, for welcoming our people as their own, for \r\nturning a relatively small nomadic tribe from the Horn \r\nof Africa into a global workforce and for the time and \r\nresources that have been invested. We are humbled by \r\ntheir generosity. We will make their efforts work for \r\nour people, but we also need their continued support.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nOnly four years ago, radical insurgents controlled \r\nour country, oppressing our people and threatening their \r\nlives. But today, children are returning to the beaches \r\nof Mogadishu and other cities along the Indian Ocean; \r\nwomen sit on dunes selling home-baked bananas, and \r\nthe sound of bullets has been replaced by the noise of \r\nconstruction. Look how far we have come, and imagine \r\nwhat we can do in another four years. We are looking \r\nforward not only to bouncing back for our own benefit, \r\nbut also to becoming a shining example to nations that \r\nare in the throes of hardship, that are working hard to \r\nmove from the third world to first, and that are finding \r\nit hard to navigate the difficult but worthwhile road \r\nto recovery. We are ready to play our part so that we \r\ncan give back, contribute to their success and their \r\nfulfilment of their rightful destiny, and take our place \r\namong the contributing nations of our global village.\r\nSomalia has failed my generation, but I will dedicate \r\nmy life to ensuring that it does not fail the next. Yet I \r\ncannot do it alone. Only together can we become the \r\nSomalia that the world is waiting for.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Republic of Somalia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Republic of Somalia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Hor Namhong, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of \r\nthe Kingdom of Cambodia.\r\nMr. Hor (Cambodia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto warmly congratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of \r\nDenmark on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventieth session. I am fully \r\nconfident that under his able leadership our Assembly \r\nwill produce results.\r\nThis year’s gathering is taking place at a critical \r\njuncture, as we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations. It is an opportunity to reflect \r\non how our world body can deal with today’s global \r\nchallenges. Cambodia warmly welcomes the adoption \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda in the form of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), an ambitious vision for building an inclusive \r\nsociety through sustainable development and putting \r\nthe world on a path to more equitable prosperity for \r\n4/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nall by 2030. But we believe that the lessons learned \r\nfrom the Millennium Development Goals will be key \r\nto ensuring success with the new Agenda. We sincerely \r\nhope that over the next 15 years, all stakeholders from \r\ndeveloped and developing countries alike will join \r\nhands in pursuit of our vital new Agenda.\r\nPoverty, food insecurity and similar problems still \r\nremain as stumbling blocks along the way ahead. Today, \r\nmore than 800 million people are undernourished and \r\nliving below the poverty line. The world’s population \r\nwill reach 9 billion by 2050, and the pressure on food \r\nsecurity will be further exacerbated. I believe that the \r\nanswers to that challenge include good governance, \r\npolicy reform and more investment in food production. \r\nSuch challenges, aggravated by armed conflicts, \r\nhave forced increasing numbers of people to f lee their \r\nhome countries. The refugee phenomenon, exploited by \r\nhuman traffickers, has now reached an alarming scale \r\nin Europe, though perhaps to a lesser degree in Asia. \r\nCambodia would like to express its deep sympathy \r\nfor the recent tragedies that have aff licted maritime \r\nmigrants in Europe.\r\nClimate change constitutes another serious global \r\nchallenge. While it is the industrialized countries that \r\nhave been the major emitters of greenhouse gases, it is \r\nthe developing countries, which are largely dependent \r\non agriculture, that have become the prime victims \r\nof climate change, with storms, typhoons and more \r\nfrequent f loods and droughts, which have a major \r\nimpact on their food security, poverty and social \r\nwelfare. Cambodia very much hopes, therefore, that the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, to be held in Paris in December, can produce \r\na binding agreement, in accordance with the principle \r\nof common but differentiated responsibilities, that will \r\nenable us to deal effectively with the global threat of \r\nclimate change and its impact on people’s welfare.\r\nFor its part, Cambodia officially launched the \r\nCambodia Climate Change Strategic Plan 2014-2023 in \r\nNovember 2013 as the first-ever comprehensive national \r\nstrategic plan to respond to climate change through \r\nadaptation, mitigation and low-carbon development. \r\nWe also adopted the National Strategic Plan on Green \r\nDevelopment for 2013-2030. Additionally, Cambodia \r\nhas launched its National Council of Green Growth \r\naimed at promoting a green economy.\r\nOn international issues, Cambodia notes that \r\ncriminal acts committed by the violent extremist group \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham and many other \r\ngroups under different names in Africa and Asia continue \r\nto intensify and spread, in spite of allied bombing and \r\nnational-level military operations. Cambodia believes \r\nthat all nations should forge concerted efforts to fight \r\nthose criminal and inhuman groups in a comprehensive \r\nand effective manner.\r\nCambodia welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates after 52 years of an unjust embargo against \r\nthe Cuban people. It also demands that all blockades \r\nbe lifted unconditionally, following the resumption of \r\ndiplomatic relations.\r\nCambodia also welcomes the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action on the nuclear programme between Iran \r\nand the P5 plus Germany. It shares the view that this \r\nagreement will not only become a turning point in Iran-\r\nUnited States relations, but that it will also create an \r\natmosphere conducive to regional peace, security and \r\npolitical stability.\r\nIn the light of current realities, Cambodia \r\nsupports the United Nations reform aimed at making \r\nthe Organization more democratic and more effective \r\nin coping with the crucial challenges the world is \r\nfacing. To that end, in Cambodia’s view, the General \r\nAssembly should be more empowered to enhance global \r\ngovernance in the United Nations system. At the same \r\ntime, the Economic and Social Council has to follow up \r\non the effective implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, adopted unanimously by our \r\nleaders a few days ago. The Security Council should \r\nalso become more democratic and representative in \r\nboth its permanent and its non-permanent membership \r\nso as to be able to assure universal peace and security \r\nin the face of the evolving dangerous situation that \r\nprevails in the world today.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Prakash Man Singh, Deputy Prime \r\nMinister of Nepal. \r\nMr. Singh (Nepal): I bring with me the warm \r\ngreetings of the people and Government of Nepal \r\nand their best wishes for the success of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the world body.\r\nI congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft of Denmark on his unanimous election to the \r\n15-29876 5/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at the seventieth \r\nsession. With his proven experience and skill, we \r\nare confident that he will guide our deliberations to \r\na fruitful conclusion. My delegation wishes to place \r\non record its sincere gratitude to the President of the \r\nAssembly at the sixty-ninth session, His Excellency \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for successfully guiding \r\nthe business of the preceding session, particularly \r\nin the run-up to the United Nations Summit for the \r\nadoption of the post-2015 development agenda, which \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) last week. Our tribute is also due to \r\nHis Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis outstanding service to the Organization in these \r\nchallenging times. \r\nThe theme of the session, “The United Nations \r\nat 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human \r\nrights”, appropriately reflects our innate and collective \r\ndesire for peace, security and human rights. These are \r\nthe issues that continue to constitute the focus of our \r\nnational priorities, regional initiatives and international \r\nengagement.\r\nI am pleased to share with the Assembly that, \r\nafter about eight years of rigorous democratic \r\nexercise conducted in an inclusive, transparent and \r\nparticipatory manner, Nepal promulgated an inclusive \r\ndemocratic Constitution 10 days ago, on 20 September. \r\nThe promulgation of the Constitution endorsed by over \r\n90 per cent of the 601 members of the Constituent \r\nAssembly marks the logical conclusion of the peace \r\nprocess, as well as the end of the protracted political \r\ntransition in the country. It has institutionalized the \r\nfederal democratic republican system of governance in \r\nNepal.\r\nThe Constitution exemplifies the victory of peace \r\nand non-violence, as inspired by the teachings of Lord \r\nBuddha. It ref lects the best of democratic principles, \r\nnorms and values, as befits a country of vast diversity \r\nthat has known centuries of social harmony and \r\ntolerance. The Constitution opens up new avenues \r\nof empowerment, progress and well-being for all \r\ndisadvantaged groups, including women, Tharus, \r\nMadhesis, indigenous people, Muslims and dalits, with \r\na resolve to create an egalitarian society by ending all \r\ndiscrimination. It guarantees 33-per-cent representation \r\nby women in the national Parliament. I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to sincerely thank our neighbours, \r\nfriends and well-wishers in the international community \r\nfor their continued support and good wishes during the \r\ncourse of our historic political transformation.\r\nNepal is fully committed to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nfirmly believe that the United Nations at 70 remains \r\na strong pillar of the international system, as well as \r\nthe institution of hope and trust. Both the continuing \r\ndetermination of the peoples and the means for attaining \r\nthe ends envisaged at the time of its inception continue \r\nto be an inspiration. \r\nThe purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nconstitute the solid foundation of international \r\nrelations. However, a review of the past seven decades \r\nof the United Nations also reveals that much more \r\nremains to be done on many fronts, despite several \r\nfar-reaching achievements to its credit. The United \r\nNations continues to confront numerous challenges in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nas well as in the effective employment of international \r\nmachinery for the promotion of the economic and social \r\nadvancement of all peoples.\r\nWe therefore feel that there is a need for a stronger \r\nUnited Nations that is capable of delivering results based \r\non wider respect for and observance of the principles of \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity, political independence \r\nand non-interference, as well as of preserving the \r\nuniversal values of peace, justice, equality, freedom \r\nand human dignity. \r\nThe reforms of the United Nations are needed to \r\nstrengthen and revitalize its work so that it may better \r\nrespond to the increasingly complex and profound \r\nchallenges. The reforms should promote good- \r\nneighbourly relations and should contribute to smarter \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. The \r\nreforms should encourage stricter adherence to the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter. They should \r\nserve to promote the economic and social advancement \r\nof all peoples and to enhance the dignity of the peoples \r\nin a just international order. These are the kind of \r\nreforms we advocate, support and aspire to. The reforms \r\nshould encourage those who can do so to contribute \r\nmore to the cause of peace and progress. The reforms \r\nshould instil hope and confidence in those who are \r\nmarginalized and extend support to those who confront \r\ndifficult circumstances.\r\nNepal has been consistently contributing to United \r\nNations peacekeeping for about six decades now. \r\n6/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nMore than 120,000 of our peacekeepers have served \r\nso far with outstanding professionalism in more than \r\n40 different missions around the globe, and 70 have \r\nmade the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. As one \r\nof the leading troop-contributing countries, Nepal \r\nremains steadfast in its commitment to maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nLoss of life and injury incurred in the line of \r\nduty must be minimized. A strong sense of safety and \r\nsecurity enhances the confidence and efficiency of \r\nthe peacekeepers. Moreover, leadership opportunities \r\nshould be made available to the member countries \r\ncommensurate with their contributions. This would \r\nmake the best use of their experience and would \r\nenhance efficiency and inspire commitment. Given its \r\nlong-standing contribution and experience, both in the \r\nfield and at Headquarters, Nepal has the ability to make \r\na contribution in senior-level leadership positions in the \r\nUnited Nations peace architecture and is willing to do \r\nso.\r\nNepal fully aligns itself with the United Nations \r\nand the international community in dealing with all \r\nthreats to peace and security. Terrorism is the biggest \r\nthreat to peace, security and development. It is shocking \r\nto see the emergence of various terrorist groups, some \r\nof which espouse violent extremism and religious \r\nfundamentalism, in different parts of the globe. We \r\nunequivocally condemn terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. As terrorism is a multifaceted problem, \r\nits solution demands greater unity, solidarity and the \r\nconcerted collaboration of nations to address its root \r\ncauses. This is best done under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations, and we are in favour of concluding a \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism at \r\nan early date.\r\nNepal stands for the general and complete \r\ndisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction and \r\nagainst the illicit transfer of small arms and light \r\nweapons. It wishes to see the world without weapons \r\nand would like all resources spent on armaments to be \r\nurgently diverted to the cause of development in the \r\ninterests of meeting the pressing needs of the people.\r\nWe consider both the normalization of relations \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba and the nuclear \r\ndeal with Iran to be important indications of forward-\r\nlooking approaches with positive implications for \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\nWe support the call for a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace in the Middle East and an end to \r\nthe conflicts in the region. We recognize the legitimate \r\nright of the Palestinian people to an independent State \r\nbased on United Nations resolutions. We recognize \r\nthe right of every nation in the region to live in peace \r\nwithin secure and recognized international boundaries.\r\nSince their categorization in 1971, the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) have grown in number \r\nfrom 25 to 48. However, only four countries have so far \r\nbeen able to graduate from this status. The rest continue \r\nto struggle for development and prosperity. Their \r\nstruggle has been unfairly long and has also been at the \r\ncost of the dignity of their people. An enhanced level \r\nof partnership and collaboration is key to addressing \r\nthe challenges they face. We welcome the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda adopted in July. Its implementation will \r\nbe critical for the success of the new Agenda. We look \r\nforward to a meaningful review of the implementation \r\nof the Istanbul Programme of Action in 2016.\r\nSimilarly, there is a strong need for effective \r\nimplementation of the Vienna Programme of Action \r\nto make a difference in the lives of about 450 million \r\npeople living in landlocked developing countries \r\n(LLDCs). The world needs to ensure unhindered access \r\nto the sea by the LLDCs, without restriction on the \r\nfree movement of people and goods. We stress that the \r\nfreedom of transit of LLDCs should not be constrained \r\nunder any circumstances or on any pretext, and that \r\nnothing should disrupt the f low of goods and services. \r\nThe freedom of transit of LLDCs must be fully and \r\nunconditionally adhered to by all transit countries.\r\nAs a country with many of the highest peaks in the \r\nworld, as well as fragile mountain ecosystems, Nepal \r\nis aware of the hardships faced by the mountainous \r\ncountries. An enhanced level of international \r\ncollaboration is essential to conserve and promote the \r\nmountain ecosystems for the benefit of all.\r\nClimate change has emerged as one of the greatest \r\ndevelopment challenges confronting us. For the least \r\ndeveloped countries, like Nepal, it increases the cost \r\nof development and also causes disproportionate \r\nimpacts on them. There is an urgent need to translate \r\ncommitments into concrete actions based on the \r\naccepted principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities, equity and respective capabilities. The \r\nachievement of a binding international instrument in \r\nParis later this year is a must.\r\n15-29876 7/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nHuman rights, equality and human dignity \r\nconstitute an integral part of the United Nations \r\nobjectives. We believe in an integrated approach to \r\ndemocracy, development and human rights, and we \r\nfirmly hold the view that democracy is indispensable for \r\ndevelopment, as well as for the enjoyment of political, \r\ncultural and social rights and the right to development. \r\nWe underline that the principles of universality, \r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity must be strictly adhered \r\nto. The new Constitution promulgated in our country \r\nguarantees the fundamental rights of our citizens. Its \r\nambitious scope has broadened the rights of women, \r\nchildren, the elderly and differently abled persons and \r\nof marginalized communities.\r\nThe issue of refugees is intricately linked with \r\npeace, security and human rights and therefore must be \r\naddressed with the seriousness and priority it deserves. \r\nMigration has emerged as a megatrend. Migrant \r\nworkers today represent a significant proportion of the \r\nmobile population. In view of the greater vulnerabilities \r\nof such people, due recognition and priority should be \r\ngiven to the protection of their rights and dignity.\r\nWe in Nepal were overwhelmed by the \r\nunprecedented scale of the expression of solidarity \r\nand cooperation from the international community \r\nin the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes that \r\nstruck Nepal in April and May. I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to express our sincere appreciation and \r\ngratitude to our neighbours, India and China, fellow \r\nmembers of the South Asian Association for Regional \r\nCooperation, and all those friends and well-wishers \r\nwho so promptly extended their humanitarian support \r\nand expressed solidarity with us in difficult moments \r\nand made us feel that we were not alone. We consider \r\nthe global outpouring of support and solidarity to be \r\nastonishing but significant evidence of the vast scope \r\nand potential of the spirit of the United Nations. Nepal \r\nlooks to continued support and solidarity in the phase \r\nof rehabilitation and reconstruction. \r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment on the historic occasion of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the founding of the United Nations has \r\ngenerated optimism for a better future across the world. \r\nTo be truly transformative, the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals must embrace everyone and must be implemented \r\nin their entirety with the required resources. To this end, \r\nguaranteed means of implementation, encompassing \r\nfinance, technology transfer, capacity and partnership, \r\nare critical. Many of the development issues that many \r\ncountries face, particularly the most vulnerable ones, \r\ndeserve more serious attention if we are to strengthen \r\nthe cause of peace and security. \r\nWe want the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to turn their immediate attention to the \r\nissues of growing inequality and dwindling resources \r\nand to the existential threat of global warming. Poverty \r\nremains a powerful threat to peace, security and human \r\nrights. It is a minefield, compounding the woes and \r\nsufferings of society. Let us not forget that it is the poor \r\nwho are constantly exposed to violence, corruption, \r\nextortion and the malpractices of the powerful.\r\nI would like to conclude with what Bishweshwar \r\nPrasad Koirala, the first elected Prime Minister of \r\nNepal, told the General Assembly at the fifteenth \r\nsession, \r\n“As we look at the world, we find that the economic \r\ndisparity between countries, as between the rich \r\nand the poor people within the nation, is the source \r\nof much friction and tension” (A/PV.878, para. 232).\r\nEconomic disparity continues to stare at us all, as it did \r\nthen. Let us commit ourselves to creating a sustainable, \r\nequitable and inclusive development in larger freedom \r\nto address this problem.\r\nI am confident that the spirit of the United Nations \r\nwill continue to prevail for the benefit of humankind in \r\nthe days to come.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear a statement by His Excellency Mr. Ri Su Yong, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nMr. Ri Su Yong (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea) (spoke in Korean; English text provided by the \r\ndelegation): I would like to congratulate Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at this historic seventieth session. I hope \r\nthat his able stewardship will lead this session, under \r\nthe theme “The United Nations at 70: the road ahead \r\nfor peace, security and human rights”, to a successful \r\noutcome.\r\nWe are now at a critical point in time in which we \r\nare reflecting on the 70 years of the United Nations and \r\ndefining the road ahead. \r\nFirst and foremost, it is important to learn lessons \r\nfrom both the successes and the failures of the United \r\nNations over the past 70 years. It is fortunate that \r\n8/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nhumankind has evaded a third world war during this \r\ntime. That should be considered a victory for the noble \r\nideal of peace over war, which was an important source \r\nof inspiration leading to the founding of the United \r\nNations. Since the start of the new millennium, the \r\npercentage of the world population living under the \r\npoverty line has been reduced by half. This amounts to \r\na triumph for the ideal of cooperation for development, \r\nwhich, along with peace, represents one of the two main \r\npillars of the United Nations.\r\nYet the world has not been at peace over the past 70 \r\nyears, nor has humankind lived in comfort. The world \r\nhas undergone hundreds of wars and armed conflicts, \r\nbig and small, some of which drove us to the brink of a \r\nnuclear disaster. The peace sought by humankind is not \r\nfragile in nature, like a thin layer of ice, but rather it is \r\nas firm, durable and permanent as a rock. It is not the \r\npeace of a slave, requiring subservience to the master; \r\nit is a peace of dignity, a peace befitting an independent \r\nhuman being. Such peace remains only a dream for \r\nhumankind.\r\nThe world has come a long way and tremendous \r\nchanges have taken place. However, the United \r\nNations system and its peacekeeping and security \r\noperations are not so very different from the old ones \r\nin the days when it was founded. The arbitrariness \r\nand undemocratic practices of the Security Council \r\nhave not been redressed. Consequently, the United \r\nNations, a hallowed international Organization, is \r\nconstantly being abused and monopolized as a forum \r\nfor confrontation by a few Powers. The result is that \r\nworld peace and security are under constant threat and \r\nhumankind has grown accustomed to having to live, \r\nagainst its will, with the smoky clouds of war overhead. \r\nThis is the biggest failure overshadowing the 70-year \r\nhistory of the United Nations, as well as the greatest \r\nchallenge we are facing on our road ahead.\r\nUnless the sovereign equality enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations is fully translated into \r\nreality, the ongoing practice of domination, inequality \r\nand unfairness cannot be eradicated at the United \r\nNations. Until international relations are democratized, \r\nthe United Nations will not be able to fulfil its \r\nmission to safeguard international peace and security. \r\nFurthermore, the United Nations will be degraded \r\nto the point of becoming a haven in which the forces \r\nbent on disrupting and destroying peace and security \r\ncamouflage their designs. This is the main lesson we \r\nhave learned as we look back on the 70 years of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nReflected on every page of the annals of the United \r\nNations is the history of our national division, stained \r\nwith the misfortunes and pains that our people have \r\nsuffered over the past seven decades. The same year the \r\nUnited Nations was founded, our nation was liberated \r\nfrom Japanese colonial rule and divided into the north \r\nand the south by a foreign force. The same foreign \r\nforce now sits on the Security Council as a permanent \r\nmember State.\r\nFor the past seven decades — from its inception to \r\ntoday — the United Nations has been used as a tool to \r\nviolate the sovereignty, dignity, peace and security of \r\nour nation. It was none other than the United Nations \r\nTemporary Commission on Korea that granted so-\r\ncalled legitimacy to the manoeuvres of the United \r\nStates, which had brought about the division of our \r\nnation by setting up a separate Government in South \r\nKorea in 1948. It was also in the name of the United \r\nNations forces that the troops of the United States and \r\n15 other satellite countries joined the Korean War in \r\n1950.\r\nAt its thirtieth session, in 1975, the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 3390 B (XXX), on the \r\nsubject of dissolving the United Nations Command and \r\nwithdrawing foreign troops from South Korea. Like \r\nall the other resolutions that the United States voted \r\nagainst, this resolution also was not implemented.\r\nAt present, nearly 40,000 United States troops, a \r\nmassive number, are stationed in South Korea—more \r\nthan in any other foreign country. The Commander \r\nof the United States Forces Command in South Korea \r\nis also the United Nations Commander and so wears \r\ntwo hats. The so-called United Nations Commander \r\ncommands the large-scale nuclear war exercises held \r\nseveral times a year by the United States of America \r\nand South Korea and has done so during the past seven \r\ndecades.\r\nEven in the twenty-first century, the Security \r\nCouncil continues to commit arbitrary acts against the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, in f lagrant \r\nviolation of justice and international law. Today, a body \r\nof international law exists that stipulates that the use of \r\nouter space is the sovereign right of every country. More \r\nthan 10 countries have launched satellites. However, \r\nthe Security Council passed a resolution prohibiting \r\n15-29876 9/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea alone from \r\nlaunching satellites. Moreover, nine countries have \r\nalready developed and conducted over 2,000 nuclear \r\ntests in total. But again, the Security Council adopted \r\nresolutions prohibiting the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea from conducting nuclear tests, which \r\nit did only three times.\r\nIn 2014, the United States launched yet another \r\nanti-Democratic People’s Republic of Korea smear \r\ncampaign in the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil on the basis of the detailed findings of \r\nthe commission of inquiry on human rights in \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea (see \r\nA/HRC/25/CRP.1), a report that relied on fabricated \r\nevidence, thereby demonstrating that the United \r\nNations is still manipulated by the United States.\r\nOur development of outer space technology for \r\npeaceful purposes is within our legitimate rights as \r\na sovereign State. Our nuclear testing is a defensive \r\nmeasure to counter the hostile policy and nuclear threat \r\nof the United State of America. The Government of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is steadfast \r\nin its resolve to uphold its dignity and rights and will \r\ncontinue to do so robustly and persistently by using all \r\nthe defensive measures at its disposal to counter the \r\nunjust actions aimed at thwarting its peaceful launch \r\nof a satellite.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations provides that the \r\nSecurity Council acts in accordance with the principles \r\nof justice and international law. However, the United \r\nNations is now in a state of chaos, and it is difficult to \r\ndetermine whether it is the Charter or some Security \r\nCouncil resolution that takes precedence. Moreover, the \r\nfact that the Security Council, which is endowed with \r\ngreater responsibility and power than any other body of \r\nthe Organization, has become so reckless and is made \r\na mockery of by an individual Power is a twenty-first \r\ncentury tragedy.\r\nLate last August, the situation on the Korean \r\npeninsula moved once again towards the brink of war. \r\nIn this case, the situation was triggered by a minor \r\nincident, whose cause remains unknown. However, it \r\nis apparent that such incidents occur every time that \r\na large-scale joint military exercise conducted by the \r\nUnited States of America and South Korea reaches its \r\nzenith.\r\nIn exercising its right as a State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations, a right enshrined in the Charter, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea brought to \r\nthe attention of the Security Council the matter of the \r\naggressive and provocative large-scale joint military \r\nexercises of the United States of America and South \r\nKorea. We requested the Council to place the matter \r\non its agenda, as the military exercises constitute a \r\nserious threat to international peace and security. \r\nWe also referred the August incident to the Security \r\nCouncil. However, every time the Security Council has \r\nremained silent on this issue.\r\nWhat measure can the United Nations take when \r\nthe so-called United Nations Commander himself \r\ncommands the large-scale war exercises that create a \r\nvicious cycle of heightened tension? Other extremely \r\nstrange phenomena have no logical explanation. Over \r\n20 years have passed since the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea joined the United Nations. But in \r\nPanmunjom, the f lags of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United Nations are hoisted \r\nopposite each other. In other words, the United Nations \r\nis in a state of war against one of its Member States and \r\ntheir guns are levelled against each other.\r\nSuccessive United Nations Secretaries-General \r\nhave stated that the United Nations Command \r\nmechanism was not under the control of the United \r\nNations, and that only the Security Council could \r\ndecide to dismantle it. In the long term, that means that \r\nas long as the United States is a permanent member \r\nof the Security Council with the right of veto, the \r\nUnited Nations Command cannot be dismantled. That \r\nestablishes an equation in which the United Nations \r\nequals the United States of America, since the United \r\nNations force on the Korean peninsula is made up of \r\nUnited States troops.\r\nThe United Nations should uphold the original \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter and address \r\nits abnormal relations with the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, both in the interest of international \r\npeace and security and for the welfare and prosperity \r\nof the Korean nation. The August incident clearly \r\nshowed the fragility of the current peace on the Korean \r\npeninsula, which is due to the abnormal relationship \r\nwith the United Nations. A rational, in-depth analysis \r\nof that incident leads to the conclusion that the Korean \r\nArmistice Agreement, as written, can no longer \r\nmaintain peace on the Korean peninsula. For the Korean \r\nArmistice Agreement has no provision regarding such \r\naggressive and provocative large-scale war exercises. \r\nReplacing the Korean Armistice Agreement with a \r\n10/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\npeace treaty first and foremost requires the United \r\nStates of America to make a bold decision.\r\nAlthough currently intra-Korean relations have \r\nbeen defused thanks to a great deal of effort, the \r\natmosphere does not promise to be as durable as one \r\nwould want. For the situation on the Korean peninsula \r\nis such that even a minor provocative act can aggravate \r\ntensions and freeze relations in an instant. \r\nSince the experience of the August incident that \r\nmade North-East Asia and the entire world watch with \r\nbated breath, it has been clear that replacing the Korean \r\nArmistice Agreement with a peace treaty without \r\nfurther delay is crucial. The safeguarding of peace \r\non the Korean peninsula requires North Korea and \r\nSouth Korea to address certain issues. The Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States of \r\nAmerica also have issues to address. \r\nThe Korean Armistice Agreement was signed \r\nin 1953 between the Korean People’s Army and the \r\nChinese People’s Volunteer Army on one side and the \r\nso-called United Nations forces on the other. With all \r\nthe other foreign troops withdrawn, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and the United States of \r\nAmerica are the only two parties in charge of the armed \r\nforces currently deployed on the Korean peninsula. \r\nThe United States of America has wartime operational \r\ncontrol of the South Korean army and also administers \r\nthe Korean Armistice Agreement. \r\nIt is high time for the United States to step forward \r\nand sign a peace treaty. The Government of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea is ready to hold \r\na constructive dialogue to prevent war and conflicts on \r\nthe Korean peninsula, once the United States agrees \r\nto replace the Korean Armistice Agreement with a \r\npeace treaty and refrains from making accusations of \r\nprovocation in the mass media. If the United States of \r\nAmerica displays courage in making a policy change, \r\nthe security environment on the Korean peninsula will \r\nimprove dramatically and the security concerns of the \r\nUnited States of America will eventually be addressed. \r\nThat is the best option and the best solution we can offer \r\nin this forum as we look back over the past 70 years and \r\nlook forward to the road ahead. \r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is \r\nstrongly convinced that a peace treaty should replace \r\nthe Korean Armistice Agreement as a means of \r\nensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula \r\nand of redressing the abnormal relations between the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the United \r\nNations. We also believe that that would help the United \r\nNations to remain true to its founding ideals and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. For its part, \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea pledges to \r\nmake sincere and energetic efforts to that end.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Raymond Tshibanda N’tungamulongo, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Tshibanda N’tungamulongo (Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo) (spoke in French): As I \r\naddress the Assembly from this rostrum on behalf of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, whom I have the \r\nhonour and privilege of representing, I should like at \r\nthe outset to join earlier speakers in congratulating \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session. His \r\nexperience as President of the National Assembly, \r\nForeign Minister and Finance Minister of Denmark, \r\nas well as his skills in development issues, are major \r\nassets for the success of his mandate. I would also like \r\nto commend his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, Foreign \r\nMinister of the Republic of Uganda, on his excellent \r\nwork as President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session at a historic moment of our Organization. \r\nLastly, I wish to pay a well-deserved tribute to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts \r\nto defend and promote the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nSeventy years after its creation, the objectives \r\nand principles of our universal and increasingly \r\nindispensable Organization are more relevant than \r\never. Peace and development are indeed the perennial \r\nand common desires of all peoples. The core of our \r\ncollective action as a community of nations will \r\nessentially and necessarily continue to be maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, ensuring justice, \r\nupholding human rights and promoting social progress \r\nand better standards of life in larger freedom. Those \r\nobjectives of our Organization are complementary and \r\nreciprocal. \r\nWithout peace, no human rights can endure, \r\nwhether civil and political rights or economic, social \r\nand cultural rights. The systematic denial or constant \r\nviolation of such rights will inevitably lead to a \r\nbreakdown of peace and social cohesion and to latent \r\nor open crises. Likewise, without peace, development \r\n15-29876 11/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nis hypothetical and the satisfaction of the vital needs \r\nof the populations is problematic. On the other hand, \r\nunderdevelopment and the poverty and insecurity that \r\naccompany it are fertile grounds for social demands \r\nthat often result in violence that is directly proportional \r\nto the perceived suffering. \r\nMoreover, in a perpetually changing world in which \r\nissues involving security, development and basic human \r\nrights know no frontiers, all our fates are interrelated. \r\nSolidarity of action and synergy of efforts are not mere \r\noptions, but rather sine qua non conditions for survival \r\nand success.\r\nThe reform of our Organization, particularly reform \r\nof the Security Council, is another sine qua non condition \r\nfor our collective effectiveness. Security Council \r\nreform must mean expanding its membership and \r\nimproving its collective representation, while ensuring \r\nthat the continent of Africa, so far marginalized, is \r\nincorporated neither too slowly nor too fast. We cannot \r\nsacrifice justice and fairness for speed. The Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo would also like to reaffirm its \r\nsupport for intergovernmental negotiations and would \r\nlike the integrity of this process to be maintained. It \r\nwould also like to reaffirm its wholehearted support \r\nfor the Ezulwini Consensus, which provides the only \r\nreasonable basis for remedying the injustice done to \r\nAfrica and settling the question of its representation. \r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo believes that \r\narmed conflicts, civil wars and all the acts of cruelty \r\nand destruction committed by terrorist groups, which \r\nperpetuate suffering and misery and create profound \r\ntension in the world, must be condemned, regardless \r\nof the perpetrators, places, goals or motivations. \r\nToday, terrorism is one of the most serious threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. One of the priorities \r\nof our Organization must be to fight this scourge, and \r\neach of our States must support and participate in the \r\nglobal counter-terrorism strategy. To remain passive \r\nagainst the rise of radicalism and extremism in their \r\nmost barbaric and murderous forms would be no more \r\nnor less than to condone the dehumanization of the \r\nworld.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo is a \r\npeace-loving country whose history has taught it the \r\ninestimable value of peace. It is working tirelessly to \r\npreserve peace and stability within its borders, in the \r\nGreat Lakes region of Africa and in the world. To that \r\nend, on 28 February 2013 in Addis Ababa, it signed the \r\nfirst Peace, Security and Cooperation Framework for \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo and the Region. \r\nIt is resolved to keep all the commitments it made by \r\nthis signature and we call on the other signatory States \r\nto do likewise.\r\nIt is also in that context that, although at a \r\nprohibitively high cost, given our country’s limited \r\nresources, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has \r\nbeen leading successful operations against hostile \r\nforces and armed groups, which over the past 15 years \r\nhave spread death and destruction in the eastern part of \r\nits territory. To that same end, it has also dispatched its \r\nown sons and daughters as soldiers and police officers \r\nto serve under the f lag of the United Nations throughout \r\nthe world. \r\nIt also feels challenged, as does the rest of \r\nhumankind, by the current migration crisis, which \r\ndemonstrates — as if a demonstration were needed  — the \r\nprecariousness of the human condition.  \r\nWhile the efforts undertaken by others to overcome \r\nthat crisis are welcome, it is important, necessary and \r\nurgent to attack the root causes, which include the \r\ndenial of human rights, underdevelopment, poverty, \r\narmed conflicts, and natural disasters, some of which \r\nhave been caused by climate change. \r\nMoved by this need, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo participated in the drafting and adoption \r\nof the new post-2015 development agenda and the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (see resolution 70/1). \r\nThat agenda embodies every hope for the peoples of the \r\nworld. Our collective duty is to do everything possible \r\nto make it a reality. Impelled by the same need to take \r\naction, the Democratic Republic of the Congo has been \r\nactively involved in preparations for the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nto be held in Paris in December, as well as in relevant \r\ninternational negotiations.\r\nWe are all striving for development that is \r\neconomically efficient, socially equitable and \r\necologically sustainable. The realization of those \r\naspirations requires action and firm commitments \r\nfrom all of us. In that respect, we all subscribed to \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. However, their \r\nfull and complete implementation has been hampered \r\nby numerous issues that we need to resolve promptly, \r\nas well as by many challenges that must be urgently \r\n12/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\naddressed, especially those regarding the environment. \r\nIn that respect, we can no longer hesitate.\r\nClimate change is one of the major challenges that \r\nour planet faces today. Its negative impact on vital \r\nsocioeconomic sectors such as agriculture and health \r\nis more apparent than ever. The same can be said of its \r\neffect on the availability of resources that are necessary \r\nto life, such as water. It is urgent that we conclude a \r\nuniversal and legally binding agreement that holds the \r\nincrease in global average temperature to below 2°C in \r\nrelation to pre-industrial levels. Let us all demonstrate \r\nour commitment to the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nin particular to the targets involving environmental \r\nprotection, by making the December session of the \r\nConference of the Parties our deadline.\r\nIn the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we \r\nare committed to making responsible sacrifices \r\nwithout jeopardizing our development. To that \r\nend, we have developed and submitted an intended \r\nnationally determined contribution. It includes \r\nboth mitigation measures, focusing on four main \r\npriority sectors — agriculture, forests, energy, and \r\ntransportation — and adaptation measures, which in \r\naddition to those four sectors also concern the protection \r\nof the coast. All of that will result in a 17 per cent \r\nrate of reduction in greenhouse gas emissions — the \r\nequivalent of 77 million tons of carbon dioxide — by \r\n2030. \r\nWe have established the same timetable in our \r\ncountry for a comprehensive and ambitious development \r\nprogramme known as the revolution of modernity. In \r\nturn, we hope that the international community will \r\nreward our efforts accordingly within the REDD+ \r\nprocess.\r\nHaving given our position on some of today’s \r\nburning issues, I would now like to talk briefly about \r\nthe situation in my country. Allow me to talk about the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo today, a country that \r\nhas certainly seen difficult times and could have very \r\nwell disappeared from the map, if it had not been for \r\nthe United Nations support and, especially, had it not \r\nbeen for the sacrifices made by a people determined \r\nto maintain, against all odds, the sovereignty of the \r\ncountry and the integrity of its territory.\r\nI would like to take the opportunity to acknowledge \r\nthe gestures of international solidarity that we have \r\nbenefited from and that have come from other States \r\nMembers of our Organization, in particular from \r\nthe contributors of troops to the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo. I pay tribute to the heroism of \r\nour defence and security forces and of our population, \r\nwho represent a mix of every age and background.\r\nOwing to the concerted efforts of all concerned, \r\nwe can affirm, without fear of contradiction, that \r\ndespite the persistence of a few residual areas of unrest, \r\nwhich we are actively trying to quell, peace, security \r\nand State authority have been restored to almost the \r\nentirety of our national territory. In conjunction with \r\nimportant structural reforms, the restoration of peace \r\nand security has fostered the resumption of large-scale \r\neconomic activities. The Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo is today one of the fastest-growing economies of \r\nAfrica, with an annual growth rate, from 2010 to 2014, \r\nconsistently higher than the average for sub-Saharan \r\nAfrica. In 2014, the growth rate stood at 9.5 per cent, \r\nthe third fastest such rate in the world. For nearly three \r\nyears, we have had an inflation rate of less than 1 per cent \r\nand a remarkable level of stability in the exchange rates \r\nof our national currency. Furthermore, governance and \r\nthe business environment have continued to undergo \r\nsuch significant improvements that the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo was ranked among the top 10 \r\nreform-oriented countries in the “Doing Business” \r\nclassification of the World Bank in 2013.\r\nHowever, we continue to face major challenges on \r\nthe path ahead. We are well aware of that, because we \r\nknow that we are a post-conflict country. Institutional \r\nstabilization efforts, security planning and the \r\nreconstruction of basic infrastructure must and will \r\ncontinue, with the aim of overcoming poverty, injustice \r\nand social inequalities.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo today \r\nis a large building site and abounds in business \r\nopportunities. It is a country full of potential and, in \r\norder to fulfil that potential, is open to the possibility \r\nof partnerships of every type, provided that they \r\nrespect its sovereignty, do not harm its vital interests \r\nand are mutually beneficial. In that regard, several \r\nsectors of commercial activity that had been limited \r\nto the public sector have been opened to competition. \r\nAccordingly, new laws are either in the process of being \r\nadopted or have already been adopted to liberalize the \r\nelectricity and insurance sectors, to promote public-\r\nprivate partnerships in the fields of agriculture and \r\ninfrastructure and to attract and retain domestic and \r\nforeign investors.\r\n15-29876 13/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nThe obligation that now lies with the Government \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and with \r\nall partners truly concerned about the welfare of the \r\nCongolese people, is that of ensuring the consolidation \r\nof all those achievements. Maintaining peace and \r\nstability and making our democratic achievements and \r\neconomic and social progress irreversible are therefore \r\nour top priorities. That is why we attach great value \r\nto the process of decentralization under way, which \r\nhas recently been accelerated with the establishment \r\nof provincial assemblies in the 21 new provinces and \r\nthe imminent arrival of provincial executives in those \r\nprovinces.\r\nSimilarly, and in accordance with the electoral \r\ntimetable published by the Independent National \r\nElectoral Commission, the Democratic Republic of \r\nCongo is preparing its general election, the third after \r\nthose of 2006 and 2011. This election, scheduled for the \r\n2015-2016 cycle, confirms a definitive break with the \r\nspiral of violence and instability that has characterized \r\nour country in recent decades and ushers in a lasting \r\nera of democracy for the Congolese people.\r\nDespite the many financial and logistical constraints \r\ncomplicating the electoral process, everything \r\nnecessary for the holding of transparent and credible \r\nelections in a peaceful climate has been put in place \r\nby the Independent National Electoral Commission, \r\nwith the support of the Government and under the \r\ndirection of the Head of State. To this end, convinced \r\nthat dialogue is a central principle of democracy and a \r\npowerful factor in social cohesion, the Head of State \r\nhas held consultations since last May with all segments \r\nof Congolese society — political actors, civil society, \r\nreligious and traditional authorities — with a view to \r\nsupporting a national dialogue.\r\nFinally, after the defeat of the Mouvement du \r\n23 mars and the surrender of several rebel groups, \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo wishes to \r\nconsolidate the new-found peace and return to normal \r\nlife. Accordingly, while we remain sincerely grateful to \r\nthe United Nations for its contribution to the restoration \r\nof that peace, we believe it is high time to reconsider \r\nthe question of a United Nations presence on Congolese \r\nterritory and to think about a gradual but major \r\nwithdrawal of the troops of the Stabilization Mission \r\nfrom the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Scappini Ricciardi (Paraguay), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nOur country expects to receive the Assembly’s \r\nsupport for this responsible and legitimate request of \r\na Member State, which it makes in full exercise of its \r\nsovereignty. It is a request that already has the support \r\nof the regional economic communities to which we \r\nbelong, the Southern African Development Community \r\nand the International Conference on the Great Lakes \r\nRegion, as well as the African Union. We fully expect \r\nthat the ongoing strategic dialogue with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his experts will lead to a recommendation \r\nto the Security Council to this effect.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Erlan Abdyldayev, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nMr. Abdyldayev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nI would first like to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session and wish \r\nhim every success in this high position of responsibility. \r\nAt the same time, we would like to express our gratitude \r\nto the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his \r\nvery fruitful leadership.\r\nI would also like to congratulate States Members \r\nof the United Nations and the Secretariat, headed by \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, on the occasion of \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the Organization and \r\nthe adoption of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. We welcome the theme of this \r\nyear’s session, “The United Nations at 70: the road \r\nahead for peace, security and human rights”, which \r\nclearly and eloquently speaks for itself.\r\nThis year also marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe end of the Second World War, which was the most \r\nbloodthirsty and destructive war that humankind has \r\never experienced. We believe that the most important \r\noutcome of the war was, first and foremost, the defeat of \r\nthe forces of fascism. The war also ended policies based \r\non an inhuman ideology and attempts to overthrow the \r\nworld order. This victory provided an opportunity to \r\naffirm such values as the recognition of the freedom and \r\nequality of peoples and the universality of international \r\nlaw, which meant an end to a planet divided into great \r\nPowers, on the one hand, and the rest of the world, on \r\nthe other. In this context, we consider that the United \r\nNations has played a historic role as the international \r\nOrganization whose membership includes almost all \r\n14/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nthe countries on the planet and to which any State can \r\nturn if it feels that its rights have been violated or its \r\nsecurity challenged.\r\nToday, the United Nations plays a clear role in \r\nimproving the well-being of the citizens of the world. \r\nThe Organization remains the only legitimate universal \r\nstructure in the field of multilateral diplomacy and \r\nintergovernmental cooperation. Kyrgyzstan recognizes \r\nthe central role of the United Nations in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, in addressing today’s \r\nchallenges in the financial, economic, social, cultural, \r\nhumanitarian and environmental spheres, in promoting \r\nand protecting human rights, and in strengthening \r\nfriendly relations between countries, in keeping with \r\nthe principles of international law.\r\nWe firmly advocate taking into account the various \r\ninterests of all nations, in accordance with international \r\nlaw, and building a peaceful world order based on a \r\nmultilateral approach. We believe that it is just this \r\ntype of development of international relations that the \r\nUnited Nations should promote.\r\nIronically, the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nend of the Second World War and the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations, which has become a symbol of unity, \r\ncollaboration and cooperation, coincides with a very \r\nalarming international situation. One quarter of a \r\ncentury after the end of the cold war, the international \r\ncommunity is once again facing the threat of a \r\npolarized world, brazen violations of fundamental rules \r\nof international law, the growth of armed conflict and \r\nother negative phenomena. Instead of the demolished \r\nBerlin Wall, we have new walls being built — those of \r\nsanctions, bans and trade barriers. \r\nDifferences have increased among the members of \r\nthe Security Council, which of course is not conducive \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and stability. \r\nWe are in fact facing a situation where some States \r\nprefer to act outside the Security Council. We consider \r\nsuch an approach counterproductive and not in keeping \r\nwith the very purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. It leads to increasing differences, \r\na loss of trust and confidence, the destabilizing of the \r\ninternational situation and a new arms race.\r\nDuring the recent United Nations Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Summit, each of us took note of the \r\nevent’s importance and took upon ourselves the \r\nobligation to collectively ensure over the next 15 years \r\nthat humankind will develop sustainably, in harmony \r\nwith nature. Kyrgyzstan welcomes the adoption of the \r\n17 overarching Sustainable Development Goals and all \r\nof their related targets. We will make every effort to \r\nfully implement them as best we can with our national \r\ncapacities. We will also continue to work in a targeted \r\nway to meet the Millennium Development Goals that \r\nhave not been entirely achieved yet.\r\nAt the same time, achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment at a national level requires solving \r\nthe issue of appropriate and adequate international \r\nfinancing. That issue was fully and intensively \r\ndiscussed by the least developed countries and donors \r\nat the third International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, held in Addis Ababa in mid-July. \r\nWe agree with the view that developing States should \r\ntake greater responsibilty for financing their national \r\ndevelopment programmes through the effective use of \r\ninternal resources, including by improving their tax \r\nadministration and, of course, by fighting corruption. \r\nHowever, donor countries will also need to remain \r\ninvolved and should promptly fulfil their commitment \r\nto increasing their official development assistance to \r\n0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product.\r\nAt the same time, we wish to underscore the \r\nneed for an environment conducive to the successful \r\nsustainable development of States and the possibility of \r\ncreating and maintaining such an environment. In the \r\nlight of our national experience, Kyrgyzstan believes \r\nthat every State has the right to development, which is \r\nan inherent, inalienable right that cannot be limited or \r\nconstrained by anyone or anything. We are convinced \r\nthat the issue of upholding that right is relevant for the \r\nmajority of developing States throughout the world. It \r\nseems to us that it is especially important in the case \r\nof landlocked developing States, of small island States \r\nand all other countries that are especially vulnerable \r\nin the face of climate change, and of heavily indebted \r\nStates, which do not have the opportunity to eradicate \r\npoverty.\r\nWe regret to note the increasing number of \r\nsituations in which one State, guided only by its self-\r\ninterest, strives to further its own development at the \r\nexpense of another State by constraining the latter’s \r\nopportunities for development. We believe that such \r\nconduct has no place in today’s civilized world. At the \r\nsame time, we note that the concept of a State’s right to \r\ndevelopment has not yet been incorporated into general \r\ninternational law. Of course, it is important to clarify \r\nthat the right to development does exist and is part of \r\n15-29876 15/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\ninternational law, but only within the framework of \r\nhuman rights. I refer first and foremost to the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, among other documents. However, we \r\nbelieve that the relevant human rights cannot be fully \r\nimplemented unless an analogous right is granted to the \r\nsubject of international law itself..\r\nWe believe that respect for and guarantees of the \r\nright of every State to development should in time \r\nbecome the foundation for forging new, equitable \r\ninternational relations at the global level and should \r\ntake their place alongside such other principles as \r\nrespect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, \r\nrejection of the use of force and non-intervention in \r\nthe internal affairs of other States. In that regard, my \r\ncountry considers it important for the concept of a \r\nState’s right to development to be widely disseminated \r\nthroughout the United Nations. We propose that the \r\nissue be considered at the expert level.\r\nSuccessful sustainable development depends \r\nto a great extent on the maintenance of security and \r\nstability at the global level. We believe that countries \r\nshould set aside their differences and work more \r\nactively together under the aegis of the United Nations \r\nto combat terrorism and violent extremism. Kyrgyzstan \r\nstrongly condemns all acts of terrorism, irrespective of \r\ntheir motivation and without regard to where and by \r\nwhom they are committed. Terrorism has root causes \r\nand reasons, but they can never be justified. We would \r\nlike to stress that the international community needs \r\nto work together more effectively to combat not only \r\nextremism but also its violent manifestations.\r\nToday we are seeing the nature of extremist threats \r\nmorph and change. To a lesser degree, activities of this \r\nnature have already spread geographically. Extremist \r\nideology is seeping into the consciousness of people in \r\nvarious regions and around the world; it is mounting an \r\nattack on society from within. Various extremist and \r\nterrorist organizations, after consolidating their power \r\nunder the banner of a single ideology, are evolving into \r\npowerful criminal structures with a wide network of \r\nlike-minded people. \r\nWe believe that combating extremism should not \r\nbe limited to addressing violent methods but that it \r\nmust also include the adoption of preventive measures \r\nto curb the influence of harmful ideologies. In the \r\neffort to combat extremism, it is also crucial for States \r\nto develop policies that protect the secular character \r\nof the State and to strengthen their interaction with \r\ntraditional religions by implementing their citizens’ \r\nright to freedom of religion.\r\nSpeaking of counter-terrorism activities at the \r\nnational level, I would like to note that Kyrgyzstan \r\nhas faithfully fulfilled its obligations and that it is \r\ncommitted to constructive engagement at the national, \r\nregional and international levels in the fight against \r\nthat evil. We see Security Council resolution 2178 \r\n(2015) as a decisive step in combating foreign terrorist \r\nfighters. Within the framework of its implementation, \r\nwe have focused our efforts on strengthening border \r\ncontrols, aviation security and building the capacity of \r\nlaw enforcement agencies, as well as on improving the \r\nexchange of information. \r\nIn February and May, our courts characterized \r\nthe Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, the Al-Nusra \r\nFront and other organizations as terrorist and extremist \r\nand banned their activities in Kyrgyzstan. On 24 July, \r\na law was adopted that establishes accountability for \r\nmercenary activities and the participation of citizens \r\nin armed conflicts or military actions on the territory \r\nof a foreign State. Our law enforcement agencies have \r\nbeen active in the fight against terrorism and violent \r\nextremism, and we are determined to continue the fight.\r\nWe are sincerely interested in the peaceful and \r\nstable development of our brother country, Afghanistan. \r\nExactly one year ago, we witnessed the inauguration \r\nof President Ghani Ahmadzai and the formation of the \r\nGovernment of National Unity headed by Mr. Abdullah \r\nAbdullah, which marked the first democratic transfer \r\nof power in the history of Afghanistan. We consider \r\nit important to set the Afghan economy on a path of \r\nstable and sustainable development, which is crucial in \r\nthe fight against terrorism and drug trafficking. We call \r\nupon the international community, particularly donors, \r\nto fully comply with their commitments to provide \r\nassistance to Afghanistan. For its part, Kyrgyzstan is \r\nready to work closely with Afghanistan on regional \r\ntrade, energy and communication projects.\r\nThe current situation in the Middle East, a region \r\ntorn by protracted conflicts and sectarian violence, is \r\nof particular concern, as thousands of innocent people, \r\nincluding women and children, are being killed. We \r\ncall on the countries of the region and the conflicting \r\nparties to start direct negotiations under the aegis \r\nof the United Nations, in order to reach a political \r\nsolution to the problem. Without strong political will \r\n16/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nand determination, it will be impossible to stop the \r\nbloodshed and to pave the way for national unity, \r\nreconciliation and reconstruction. We believe that \r\nexternal intervention in any conflict should remain a \r\nlast resort and should be used only with the approval of \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nAt the same time, we believe that special attention \r\nshould be paid to the emergence of new challenges to \r\nworld civilization. Those new challenges differ from \r\nthe more traditional challenges of inter-State conflicts; \r\nrather they take the shape of ideological conflicts. Such \r\nchallenges do not arise solely in situations of religious \r\nextremism; they also appear in numerous situations \r\nin which one State attempts to impose its vision of \r\ndevelopment on other States. In that context, a principled \r\nassessment of such practices is essential, regardless \r\nof the source of the ideology. We believe that the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council — which, \r\nas the victorious Powers of the Second World War, \r\ntook responsibility for the fate of the world — should \r\nnow likewise assume the responsibility to combat such \r\npractices, which undermine the very basis on which \r\ndevelopment of inter-State relations rests.\r\nIt has been 70 years since the first use of a nuclear \r\nweapon occurred, and 45 years since the date of entry \r\ninto force of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. Yes, humankind has managed to \r\nprevent a recurrence of the use of nuclear weapons. \r\nHowever, as long as nuclear weapons exist, the risk of \r\ntheir intentional or even their unintentional use will \r\nremain. We regret to note that the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty has not yet entered into force, \r\nand that the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nended without the adoption of the most important \r\noutcome document.\r\nIn such circumstances, the Treaty on a Nuclear-\r\nWeapon-Free Zone in Central Asia represents a \r\nsignificant contribution to the global process of nuclear \r\ndisarmament. As the depositary and the coordinator of \r\nthe States parties to the Treaty, Kyrgyzstan expresses its \r\nappreciation to the Russian Federation, China, France \r\nand Great Britain for their ratification of the protocol \r\non negative security assurances and urges the United \r\nStates to ratify that instrument without further delay. \r\nWe have recently witnessed the successful \r\ncompletion of the long-running negotiations between \r\nIran and the group of six countries as well as the \r\nadoption of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on \r\nthe Iranian nuclear programme. I wish to congratulate \r\nthe group and the Islamic Republic of Iran on the \r\noccasion of this historic event. \r\nAs a member of the newest nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone, Kyrgyzstan urges the countries of the Middle \r\nEast to establish in the region a zone free of nuclear \r\nweapons and all other weapons of mass destruction and \r\ntheir delivery systems. This would serve as a milestone \r\nin the field of disarmament, thereby promoting peace in \r\nthe Middle East.\r\nOne of the most important instruments in terms of \r\nsustainable development is upholding the security of \r\nthe State. Here we deem crucial the strengthening of \r\nthe entire spectrum of cooperation with our neighbours. \r\nInclusive dialogue and cooperation, in our view, are the \r\nonly ways to resolve the problems in our region.\r\nOn the other hand, it must be noted that not all of \r\nthe existing problems in the region of Central Asia can \r\nbe successfully and rapidly resolved. We refer here \r\nprimarily to the development of trade and economic \r\nrelations on an equitable, fair and mutually beneficial \r\nbasis.\r\nEfforts remain insufficient in the areas of resolving \r\nborder issues, coordinating efforts to promote regional \r\nsecurity, liberalizing trade rules, harmonizing national \r\nlegislation and ensuring safe transit over inter-State \r\nroads and railway lines. The coordination of approaches \r\nto developing the energy and transportation sectors \r\nremains insufficient.\r\nIssues related to the shared use of water \r\nresources are also a focus of Central Asian inter-State \r\nrelations. In this regard, it should be noted that in the \r\nimplementation of the national development course it \r\nhas chosen, Kyrgyzstan intends to focus in particular \r\non the development of our hydropower potential as the \r\nbasis for the sustainable development of our country. \r\nOur principled position is that our water resources and \r\nour energy potential are closely linked. So to achieve \r\nits right to development, Kyrgyzstan has been using \r\nits water resources to achieve sustained social and \r\neconomic development, including on the basis of the \r\nmodel of the green economy.\r\nNo less important at the regional level is the \r\nfact that a number of border issues have not yet been \r\nsettled, although their successful resolution is clearly \r\nin keeping with the interests of all States in the region. \r\n15-29876 17/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nThis will increase transit trade potential and promote \r\nthe development of border infrastructure in our country, \r\nwhich would improve the economy and help reduce \r\nsocial tension in the region.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, we believe that the \r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive regional cooperation \r\nframework would be fundamental to ensuring \r\nsustainable development, stability and security for the \r\nwhole of the Central Asian region.\r\nThe absence of a direct multilateral political \r\ndialogue among the Central Asian countries themselves \r\nexacerbates regional problems and constrains the \r\neconomic development of our countries. Unfortunately, \r\nhowever, we are forced to note that the common \r\nproblems we face do not mean that our countries form \r\na united front when addressing these problems in \r\ninternational forums.\r\nWe believe that the time has come to create a broad \r\nplatform for dialogue among all five Central Asian \r\nStates. It is vital to create such a new, high-quality \r\nmechanism within the framework of which we could \r\ndiscuss issues related to trade, economy, borders, energy, \r\nwater use, transport interfaces, the environment and \r\nclimate change. We call on our neighbours to consider \r\nour initiative. Kyrgyzstan, in turn, stands ready to start \r\ndiscussing the details of such a new regional platform.\r\nIn the political Declaration of the United Nations \r\nSustainable Development Summit (see resolution 70/1), \r\nwe agreed to strengthen democracy, good governance, \r\nthe rule of law and respect for human rights, as well \r\nas to ensure economic growth, all of which make a \r\npositive contribution to sustainable development. We \r\nfully agree with this concept and intend to make a \r\nworthy contribution to international efforts to that end. \r\nHowever, it should be pointed out that Kyrgyzstan has its \r\nown historical policy on and path towards democracy; \r\nit is fundamental to our national identity. For centuries, \r\ndemocratic values have formed the basis of our society; \r\nthey are not foreign, abstract ideas. Kyrgyzstan, based \r\non its own historical and cultural experience, has been \r\nconsistently developing and strengthening its model \r\nfor national governance based on the principles of \r\nparliamentary democracy.\r\nKyrgyzstan will soon hold parliamentary elections, \r\nwhich will serve as an indicator of the country’s \r\nlevel of democratic development. Their outcome will \r\nstrengthen the principles of openness and togetherness \r\nof our people. The elections will be held on the basis \r\nof the democratic principles of openness and fairness, \r\nin accordance with national legislation and our \r\ninternational obligations.\r\nIn August of this year, a historic event took place \r\nwhen Kyrgyzstan became a full-f ledged member \r\nof the Eurasian Economic Union. That membership \r\nprovides Kyrgyzstan with unrestricted access to a \r\nregional market for goods and services, capital and \r\nlabour and with a further opportunity to develop our \r\nagriculture and industry, as well as our transport and \r\ntransit potential. Participation therein will also enhance \r\nthe competitiveness of our national economy and its \r\nintegration into the world economy.\r\nAt the same time, as a result of our recent positive \r\naccomplishments, in 2014 the World Bank moved \r\nKyrgyzstan from the category of poorest countries to \r\nthat of middle-income countries. In order to maintain \r\nsustainable economic growth in Kyrgyzstan, 2015 \r\nwas declared the “Year of Strengthening the National \r\nEconomy”.\r\nI would also like to note that we in Kyrgyzstan are \r\nwaging an uncompromising fight against corruption. In \r\n2014, Kyrgyzstan improved its status in international \r\ncommunity rankings on corruption, moving from 150th \r\nto 136th place. We are determined to continue to work \r\nin this direction in accordance with the international \r\ncampaign to strengthen good governance.\r\nThe protection of human rights is one of the main \r\npriorities of our State policy. My country seeks to fulfil \r\nall of the obligations it has undertaken under the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights and other international human rights \r\ntreaties and agreements. Today in Kyrgyzstan there is \r\nfreedom of the press, and civil society is developing \r\nactively. We have also strengthened inter-ethnic \r\nrelations.\r\nKyrgyzstan has put forward its candidacy for \r\nelection to the Human Rights Council for the period \r\n2016-2018. Here I would once again request the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to back our candidacy \r\nin the elections, to be held in October this year.\r\nBy way of conclusion, I wish to revisit the topic of \r\nthe creation of the United Nations 70 years ago, which \r\ninfused us with a sense of confidence in the future and \r\nhas become the embodiment of the best of universal \r\nideals and a champion of the interests of peoples of \r\nthe world. In the 70 years of its existence, the United \r\n18/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nNations has firmly established itself as an effective and \r\nuniversally recognized centre for international security \r\nand responsibility.\r\nThe achievements of the United Nations include \r\nmechanisms for conflict prevention, impartial \r\nmediation, peacekeeping and peacebuilding. The United \r\nNations has also become one of the most important \r\ntools for resolving socioeconomic, financial, cultural, \r\nhumanitarian and other problems at the international \r\nlevel. Its specialized agencies, funds, programmes \r\nand structures are highly relevant and much needed \r\nand often function as effective partners for developing \r\ncountries.\r\nToday humankind is experiencing a very difficult \r\ntime its development, and the United Nations is being \r\ntested in terms of its ability to promote the modern \r\nworld order. In this situation, we must pool the efforts \r\nof the Member States in addressing global challenges \r\nand threats to international security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. At the forefront of this campaign should \r\nbe a reformed United Nations, one that enjoys political \r\nand financial support from its Member States. In this \r\nrespect, I encourage all to support and strengthen our \r\nOrganization.\r\nKyrgyzstan, for its part, will always cooperate \r\nactively and responsibly with the United Nations to \r\nsupport its activities to find joint solutions to global \r\nproblems.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Frederick A. Mitchell, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration of the \r\nCommonwealth of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Bahamas): I bring you, Sir, and the \r\nAssembly warm fraternal and sisterly greetings from \r\nthe Commonwealth of the Bahamas, the country which \r\none of our most famous sons, the Reverend Dr. Myles \r\nMunroe, now sadly deceased, described as the place \r\nwhere God resides. \r\nI would like to pause just for a few minutes to \r\nacknowledge the expressions of concern that have \r\ncome from across the world about the fact that there \r\nis a hurricane sitting over the southern part of the \r\nBahamas. There has been considerable f looding. We \r\nhave not heard of any loss of life. There is likely to be \r\nsome property damage. I suppose that by morning we \r\nwill know the true impact of the hurricane. I would like \r\nto thank the Assembly for its expressions of concern.\r\nWe return this year, on the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe Organization, to reaffirm the values we committed \r\nto in 1973 when we subscribed to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations — from democracy, the rule of law, the \r\nprotection of the weak and vulnerable to the elimination \r\nof all forms of discrimination. Each year at this time we \r\njoin the struggle anew to fight to uphold those values. \r\nTonight, I pause to reflect on the progress we have \r\nmade in some areas. \r\nThis year, for example, marks the thirtieth year \r\nsince the Nassau Accord was agreed and signed by the \r\nHeads of Government of the Commonwealth of Nations \r\nin our capital city, in October 1985. That Accord led \r\nto a comprehensive set of sanctions on the apartheid \r\nregime of South Africa and helped free Nelson Mandela \r\nand establish full democracy in the Republic of South \r\nAfrica. \r\nAs we look back, despite the world’s troubles, \r\nwe can repeat the words of the old African American \r\npreacher: “I know we ain’t what we want to be, but thank \r\nGod we ain’t what we was.” I also repeat the concerns \r\nthat I raised last year: the environment, climate change, \r\ncrime and security, the economy and the development \r\nof our young people (see A/69/PV.20). \r\nI want to turn to the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. Our Prime Minister, the Right Honourable Perry \r\nChristie, was among the world leaders who last week \r\nunanimously adopted the ambitious, transformative and \r\nuniversal 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), which will chart our way forward \r\nfor the next 15 years and solidify and reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to the pillars of the Organization and to \r\nenvironmental protection. \r\nWith respect to crime and security, I recall the \r\nwords of a former Prime Minister of Jamaica, the \r\nlate Michael Manley, who often spoke of a symbiotic \r\nrelationship between the developed world and the \r\nCaribbean region. He said that each year, millions of \r\npeople from the developed world travelled to our region \r\nto have a peaceful, quiet and salubrious vacation. That, \r\nhe argued, was a benefit to them. The Caribbean region, \r\nincluding the Bahamas, provides a tourist experience \r\nthat is unparalleled in the world. However, the world \r\nmust pay attention to the underlying development issues \r\nthat the region faces, lest that benefit be threatened. \r\nFor example, we must stop the escalating crime and \r\nviolence from drug trafficking, human trafficking and \r\nsmuggling and juvenile gangs. That is why we have \r\n15-29876 19/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nbeen so strong in our support of the small arms trade \r\ntreaty. The carnage of our young people, which is due \r\nin particular to the fact that guns are easily available to \r\nyoung males,, is not acceptable and is unsustainable. \r\nThe Bahamas was pleased to have participated \r\nactively in the First Conference of States Parties to the \r\nArms Trade Treaty (ATT), held in Mexico in August. \r\nWhile we are disappointed that the ATT secretariat will \r\nnot be located in our region, in our sister Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) country of Trinidad and \r\nTobago, we, nevertheless, are committed to the full \r\nand effective implementation of that Treaty. We call \r\non the producers of these weapons to do more to stop \r\ntheir illegal export to our region and end the carnage. \r\nAs Mr. Manley rightly pointed out many years ago, the \r\ndeveloped world will not be immune if the matter is not \r\nbrought under control.\r\nWith regard to development and reform, there can \r\nbe no economic and social development unless we \r\nachieve gender equality and empower women and girls. \r\nThe Bahamas is committed to this achievement and \r\nempowerment and has actively participated in various \r\nmeetings on gender equality and the advancement of \r\nwomen, regionally and here at the United Nations. \r\nWe were represented on 27 September at the Global \r\nLeaders Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s \r\nEmpowerment by our Minister for Gender Affairs, the \r\nHonourable Melanie Griffin. The Bahamas is proud \r\nto have now ratified the Convention on the Rights of \r\nPersons with Disabilities and the Optional Protocols to \r\nthe Convention of the Rights of the Child. These acts, \r\nin our view, enhance our commitment to human rights. \r\nScales of assessment for peacekeeping are being \r\nreviewed. The Bahamas attaches great importance to \r\nthe United Nations peacekeeping operations as these, \r\nin part, underpin the purposes of the United Nations. \r\nIt remains fully committed to meeting its financial \r\nobligations to the Organization in a full and timely \r\nmanner and without any conditions. The Bahamas is, \r\nhowever, of the view that those scales of assessment \r\nshould take into consideration the unique circumstances \r\nof small island developing States, particularly those \r\nthat are most vulnerable. It also maintains that gross \r\ndomestic product and gross national income per capita, \r\nshould not serve as the main component in determining \r\nthe levels of assessment for peacekeeping operations \r\nand, furthermore, that no developing country should be \r\ncategorized above level C.\r\nI would now like to address the issues of human rights, \r\nthe human rights aspects of national development and the \r\nfact that we are presenting our candidature for election \r\nto the Human Rights Council. With the same critical \r\nsense of direction, commitment and urgency expressed \r\nearlier with regard to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and reform within the Organization, \r\nthe Bahamas is actively crafting, with a critical \r\neye, a 25-year citizen-driven national development \r\nplan — Vision 2040. The national development \r\nplan will provide a comprehensive overview of the \r\neconomy, set policy direction for economic growth \r\nand identify strategies, programmes and projects to \r\nimprove the overall health and sustainability of the \r\nBahamian economy. It is being led by one of our young \r\nMinisters, Khaalis Rolle. It will also reinvigorate \r\nour national outlook and set new priorities for our \r\ninternational engagement going forward. We will \r\nenhance our expertise in the areas of maritime affairs \r\nand ocean conservation, environmental sustainability \r\nand economic and tax matters to assist in the further \r\ndevelopment and execution of our national priorities, \r\nboth regionally and internationally. We are continuing \r\nto try to build a stronger Bahamas. \r\nThe Bahamas is seeking a seat on the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in the election to be held on 28 October. The \r\nBahamas is the first State member of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity and the first English-speaking country in \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean region to do so. We \r\ndo not do so lightly. Our election to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil would provide a unique opportunity to bring \r\nbalance in the promotion and consideration of global \r\nhuman rights issues in that we would provide the \r\nperspective of a small State. We hope that we can count \r\non the support of Member States for our candidature for \r\nelection both to the Human Rights Council and to the \r\nCouncil of the International Maritime Organization.\r\nI speak up again this year for the right of the people \r\nof the Turks and Caicos islands to self-determination. \r\nThe Bahamas is among those justly demanding \r\nreparations for the damage inflicted on Caribbean \r\nsocieties by slavery. In the words of our poet and singer \r\nTony McKay: “I come to collect everything that you owe \r\nme ... pay me what you owe me.” The Bahamas supports \r\nour sister CARICOM State, Belize, in its quest to live \r\nwithin secure and recognized borders. Similarly, we \r\nare deeply concerned about the attempt to undermine \r\nthe territorial integrity of our sister CARICOM State, \r\nGuyana.\r\n20/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nThe Bahamas is pleased at the rapprochement \r\nbetween the United States of America and Cuba. \r\nPresident Barack Obama of the United States has made \r\nthe right, courageous decision. This enhances the peace \r\nin our neighbourhood, and our officials are working \r\nwith Cuba on synergies for the development of our \r\neconomies. This year we will once again support an end \r\nto the economic embargo when the draft resolution is \r\nvoted on in the General Assembly.\r\nConcerning the evironment and climate change, \r\nI would like to say that we welcome the launch on \r\n30 September of the Small Island Developing States \r\nSustainable Energy Initiative (SIDS DOCK), which \r\nwas jointly developed by the Caribbean Community \r\nClimate Change Centre and the secretariat of the Pacific \r\nRegional Environment Programme, in cooperation \r\nwith the Alliance of Small Island States. SIDS DOCK \r\nis meant to assist small island developing States in the \r\nPacific and Caribbean regions in addressing the effects \r\nof climate change, providing them with a collective \r\ninstitutional mechanism to help them transform their \r\nnational energy sectors into catalysts for sustainable \r\neconomic development and generating financial \r\nresources for addressing adaptation to climate change.\r\nWe affirm our commitment to a binding agreement \r\nin Paris at the forthcoming Climate Change Conference \r\nand urge all countries to work to that end. As I said \r\nearlier, even as we speak the Bahamas is under the \r\nthreat of f looding and a hurricane. When one realizes \r\nthat 80 per cent of our land is lower than five feet \r\nabove sea level, one understands that a tidal surge is \r\ncertainly an existential threat to our country and an \r\nexample of a threat posed by climate change. We urge \r\ncontinued support for the people of Dominica, our sister \r\nCARICOM State, which suffered enormous damage \r\nand loss of life from Tropical Storm Erika in August. \r\nWe would also like to express our solidarity with the \r\npeople of Chile, who suffered damage and loss of life \r\nduring the recent earthquake there.\r\nMigration and the global refugee crisis are an \r\nincreasing problem around the world. In the view of \r\nthe Bahamas, we are facing the most pressing refugee \r\ncrisis since the Second World War. In recent months, \r\nwe have seen hundreds of thousands of migrants and \r\nrefugees from conflict- and war-torn areas throughout \r\nthe Middle East embarking on perilous journeys in \r\ntheir search for refuge in Western Europe. \r\nFor the Bahamas, illegal migration through its \r\nterritory is an awful reality. We are resolute in our task \r\nof ensuring that migration is lawful, safe and orderly, \r\nand that it involves increased dialogue and greater \r\nparticipation in the process by all countries of origin, \r\ntransit and destination. We are equally mindful of our \r\ninternational obligations, in tandem with our sovereign \r\nright to protect our borders. We strive to ensure that \r\nrespect for human rights is integral to our migration \r\npolicies. The Bahamas will, however, take all measures \r\nwithin the law and international norms to protect its \r\nborders and ensure that it is not overrun by illegal \r\nmigrants.\r\nI end with a plea for the young people of the world. \r\nWe must commit to them afresh, here at the United \r\nNations. They are the future, and everything we do \r\nmust be done keeping in mind the fact that, whether we \r\nlike it or not, we are handing things over to them. Now \r\nis the time to act to end their sense of hopelessness and \r\ntheir joblessness. The Prime Minister of the Bahamas \r\nsaid it here again last week: if we ignore them, we do so \r\nat our peril (see A/70/PV.4). \r\nBack in 1919, the Irish poet William Butler Yeats, \r\nspeaking to his generation, lamented that the centre \r\ncould not hold. That poem was written before the \r\nUnited Nations came into being. Today, this body is \r\nat the centre of the human endeavour, so let us ensure \r\nthat the centre does hold. The Bahamas is committed \r\nto the United Nations and to a sustainable future for \r\nour world. Where better than in this building, and who \r\nbetter than the United Nations? I say again, now more \r\nthan ever we need the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Adel Ahmed Al-Jubeir, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia.\r\nMr. Al-Jubeir (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nSeventy years have passed since the United Nations \r\nwas founded, and we are gathered here today to recall \r\ntogether the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. My country was among the \r\nfounding signatory Members in 1945.\r\nWe all realize that the United Nations came into \r\nthe world in the wake of two world wars that resulted \r\nin enormous financial and human costs, something \r\nthat makes us understand the importance of upholding \r\nthe principles of the Charter, aimed at establishing \r\nsecurity and stability in our world. Paramount among \r\nthose principles is that of preventing new destructive \r\nand lethal wars and conflicts. We should not forget \r\n15-29876 21/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nthat the main principle and goal is the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. That can be achieved \r\nonly by promoting justice, equality and respect for \r\ninternational law among our nations, and in particular \r\nthe principle of State sovereignty, in accordance with \r\nthe Treaty of Westphalia of 1648, which established \r\nState independence and sovereignty as the basis of \r\nmodern international relations.\r\nThe Palestinian question has become a permanent \r\nitem on the General Assembly’s agenda. Today, \r\ndespite all the initiatives and opinions that have been \r\nput forward, the Palestinian people continue to suffer \r\nand to be deprived of their right to live in dignity, in \r\nf lagrant defiance of the rules of international law and \r\ninternationally legitimate resolutions. We are in urgent \r\nneed of a solution to the Arab-Israeli conflict, based \r\non the relevant resolutions of the Security Council and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative, which was promoted by my \r\ncountry and adopted 13 years ago by the Arab and Islamic \r\nworlds and has garnered wide international support. Its \r\naim is to establish an independent Palestinian State with \r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif as its capital. That is why we repeat \r\nour denunciation of Israel’s violations of the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque, which have exacerbated the conflict, as well \r\nas extremism and violence in the world.\r\nThe crisis in Syria has now entered its fifth \r\nyear. The international community continues to be \r\nincapable of taking decisive steps to save the Syrian \r\npeople from the machinery of killing, destruction and \r\nforced displacement operated by Bashar Al-Assad, \r\nwhich has resulted in the deaths of more than 300,000 \r\npeople and the displacement of 12 million Syrians \r\nand the destruction of the country in one of the worst \r\nhumanitarian disasters we have seen in our times. The \r\nonly way to resolve this crisis is through a political \r\nsolution based on the Geneva I final communiqué \r\n(A/66/865, annex), in order to maintain Syria’s national \r\nunity and preserve its State institutions, both civil and \r\nmilitary, and to create a transitional council on which \r\nBashar Al-Assad and those who have Syrian blood on \r\ntheir hands have no place. We will continue to push for \r\nsuch a solution and will be among the first countries \r\nto support the Syrian people and to contribute to \r\nalleviating their suffering.\r\nThe legitimate coalition forces accomplished much \r\nin Yemen. Chief among their achievements was the \r\nliberation of the city of Aden and of the Bab al-Mandab \r\nStrait, which secured international maritime freedom. \r\nThe military option was a last resort following the \r\ncoup d’êtat staged by the Houthis and Saleh in which \r\nthey seized power and laid siege to the presidential \r\npalace and residence in Aden, thereby threatening \r\nthe legitimate President. In response, we initiated a \r\nmilitary intervention on the basis of a demand by the \r\nlegitimate Government of Yemen and in accordance \r\nwith Article 51 of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nOur aim is to find a political solution based on the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council initiative, the conclusions of the \r\nnational dialogue, and Security Council resolution 2216 \r\n(2015). Although we recognize that the Houthis are part \r\nand parcel of the social fabric in Yemen, that does not \r\ngive them the prerogative to own militias outside the \r\nframework of the State of Yemen or at the expense of \r\nthe rest of the Yemeni people.\r\nCertain parties are trying to exacerbate and \r\nescalate the crisis in Yemen through incitment and arms \r\nsmuggling, as when an Iranian ship laden with arms \r\nfor the rebels was intercepted on 26 September. Our \r\nKingdom and our partners are intensifying efforts in \r\norder to mobilize international humanitarian assistance \r\nto Yemen. The King Salman Humanitarian Aid and \r\nRelief Centre has provided assistance to the brotherly \r\npeople of Yemen. His Majesty, the Custodian of the Two \r\nHoly Mosques, is striving to improve the conditions \r\nof the Yemenis who live illegally in the Kingdom by \r\nproviding employment, education and health care.\r\nConvinced that the realization of the principles and \r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations should \r\nfocus on the maintenance of security and peace the \r\nworld over, we were in the vanguard of the nations \r\ncalling for a zone free of nuclear and other weapons of \r\nmass destruction in the Middle East. That is why we \r\nwelcomed the recent agreement between the P5+1 and \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran, which prevents Iran from \r\nacquiring nuclear weapons. We call on Iran to renounce \r\nits meddling in Arab affairs, which we will firmly resist \r\nin our desire to build good-neighbourly relations with \r\nIran, based on mutual respect, good neighbourliness \r\nand non-interference in the affairs of other countries. \r\nWe also call on Iran to end its occupation of the three \r\nislands in the Arabian Gulf belonging to the sisterly \r\nUnited Arab Emirates.\r\nWe are among the States targeted by terrorism \r\nand extremism. We continue to fight terrorists and \r\nare determined to find a way to eradicat the grave \r\nphenomenon of terrorism. We were among the first \r\ncountries to combat terrorism in all its intellectual and \r\nideological aspects and to seek to cut off its financial \r\n22/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nresources. We denounce the attempt by terrorists to \r\nattribute their crimes to Islam, the religion of love, \r\npeace, moderation and tolerance.\r\nWe attach primary importance to development \r\nissues, especially in developing countries. Successful \r\ndevelopment hinges on the international community’s \r\nrespect for a nation’s specificities, whether historical, \r\nethnic, religious or cultural. The achievement of \r\nsustainable development should therefore take into \r\nacount the specific aims of each individual country and \r\nits particular level of development. For that reason, we \r\nhave been actively and directly involved in shaping the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nIn closing, I wish to stress the role of the United \r\nNations and its bodies in our changing world. The \r\nchallenges we face in various fields make it incumbent \r\nupon us to enhance the role of the United Nations and to \r\nreinvigorate its bodies, pushing ahead with the reform \r\nof the Organization so that it can keep pace with the \r\nchanges in the international arena.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Rimbink Pato, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Trade and Immigration of the \r\nIndependent State of Papua New Guinea.\r\nMr. Pato (Papua New Guinea): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Papua New Guinea, I \r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventieth session on his election. We also pay \r\ntribute to his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa, Foreign Minister of Uganda, for his able \r\nleadership as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-ninth session and for steering the course for \r\nthe adoption of the post-2015 development agenda. \r\nFurthermore, we extend our gratitude to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his unfailing commitment and visionary \r\nleadership of the United Nations, thereby ensuring that \r\nthe spirit of the Charter remains an enduring pillar for \r\nour collective well-being as we retool it to meet the \r\nemerging challenges and opportunities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century and beyond.\r\nWe commend the theme of the general debate, “The \r\nUnited Nations at 70: a new commitment to action”, \r\nand pledge our support to the presidency in ensuring \r\nthe effective implementation of the transformative \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) that was adopted unanimously a few days ago. \r\nAs Papua New Guinea celebrates its fortieth year of \r\nnationhood, we also join the United Nations family this \r\nyear in marking the founding of the United Nations \r\n70 years ago. My Government is committed to working \r\nin close partnership with all stakeholders to implement \r\nthe post-2015 development agenda, which in turn must \r\nbe nationally owned and driven. \r\nWe can succeed only when countries truly own and \r\nlead their national development plans and strategies, \r\nwhile integrating the 2030 Agenda. Consistent with \r\nits 2014 national strategy for responsible sustainable \r\ndevelopment, Papua New Guinea recognizes that a \r\nhealthy, well-educated population is the underlying \r\ndriver for development. \r\nThe principle of responsible, sustainable \r\ndevelopment means that we do not conduct ourselves \r\nin a manner that will compromise future generations. \r\nThe high-level political forum must support national, \r\nregional and global efforts with respect to the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and avoid \r\nissues such as those that undermined the work of \r\nthe Commission on Sustainable Development. The \r\nGovernment of Papua New Guinea has adopted enabling \r\nnational policies, strategies and plans to provide an \r\nenvironment conducive to achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and the SDGs. Those policies cover \r\nthe areas of population, water and sanitation, hygiene, \r\nfree basic health services and tuition-free education. \r\nThe free-education policy has led to the enrolment in \r\nschools of an additional 2 million children in the past \r\ntwo years.\r\nPapua New Guinea has laid a strong foundation \r\nfor development in the past decade. This has resulted \r\nin unprecedented economic growth, which reached \r\ndouble digits in 2012. However, the current depression \r\nin international commodity prices and stock markets \r\nhas negatively impacted the country’s economic \r\nperformance. We are taking steps to ensure that the \r\nrecent adverse conditions do not jeopardize the positive \r\ngains made in the past 10 years. Papua New Guinea \r\nis part of the global economy and, as such, seeks a \r\nstable, equitable international economic and financial \r\narchitecture to support our efforts in advancing \r\nhuman development. The challenge for Papua New \r\nGuinea is to translate enhanced economic growth and \r\nother transformations into improved practical human \r\ndevelopment outcomes, in order to achieve our National \r\nVision 2050. That should then result in the achievement \r\nof the SDGs.\r\nAs we gather here today, there are many conflicts \r\nworldwide, with millions of people displaced and forced \r\n15-29876 23/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nto leave their homes under risky conditions, in search \r\nof safety and security. Threats to peace and security \r\nhinder the achievement of the 2030 Agenda. Those \r\nsecurity concerns, including transnational crime and \r\ninternational terrorism, if not adequately contained, \r\nwill have proliferating cross-border effects on global \r\npeace, stability and economic prosperity, including for \r\nus in the Pacific Islands region. Papua New Guinea \r\nechoes the calls on all conflicting parties to amicably \r\ndiscuss and resolve their differences under the mandate \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, with a view to \r\nmaintaining global peace and security.\r\nPapua New Guinea is proud to contribute to the \r\nUnited Nations and regional peacekeepers in South \r\nSudan and Darfur. We hope to increase our deployment \r\nnumbers as our economy grows.\r\nThe global refugee crisis has reached Papua New \r\nGuinea. We have received refugees and asylum seekers \r\nsince independence. We are currently working closely \r\nwith the Government of Australia by providing an \r\nasylum-seeker processing facility and contributing \r\nto finding lasting solutions to the global challenge. \r\nWe strongly believe that it is high time for the global \r\ncommunity to seriously address the root causes of the \r\nrefugee situation and the forced displacement of people \r\nand families.\r\nThe illicit trade in small arms and light weapons \r\nremains a serious threat to national and global \r\npeace, security and development. In that light, Papua \r\nNew Guinea has prioritized policy initiatives and \r\nprogrammes to curb the importation and trading of \r\nfirearms. \r\nPapua New Guinea reaffirms its commitment to \r\nupholding and protecting fundamental human rights. \r\nOur national population policy 2015-2024 recognizes \r\nthat human rights are closely intertwined with \r\nsustainable development.\r\nPapua New Guinea welcomes the Sendai Framework \r\nfor Disaster Risk Reduction. This global mechanism is \r\nessential, given the increasing frequency and severity \r\nof climate-induced natural disasters, particularly in our \r\nPacific islands region. Recognizing the need for better \r\npreparation for timely responses to disasters and crisis \r\nsituations, the Pacific subregional grouping — the \r\nMelanesian Spearhead Group — is in the process of \r\nestablishing a humanitarian and emergency technical \r\nresponse coordination centre. We welcome technical \r\nand capacity-building assistance from the international \r\ncommunity to support our efforts, as provided for \r\nunder international agreements, including the SIDS \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway. \r\nThe world has changed since the formation of \r\nthe United Nations 70 years ago. The current United \r\nNations system requires urgent reform, and we \r\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General in that \r\nregard. On Security Council reform, we welcome \r\nthe General Assembly’s recent adoption of decision \r\n69/560, on equitable distribution and representation in \r\nthe Council’s membership. Additionally, Papua New \r\nGuinea supports the initiative to review the use of the \r\nveto power in the Security Council, particularly during \r\ntimes of grave humanitarian crisis and mass atrocities.\r\nIn the regional context, we are fully supportive of \r\nthe 2014 Pacific Islands Forum reforms, whereby a new \r\nregional development road map — the Framework for \r\nPacific Regionalism — was adopted to promote greater \r\nregional cooperation, integration and connectivity. \r\nThrough this Framework, Papua New Guinea \r\ncommitted $100 million for 2014-2018 to its regional \r\noutreach programme, to support Pacific SIDS in \r\ncritical areas of development such as good governance, \r\neducation, health, capacity-building, climate change, \r\nrelief assistance and natural disaster reconstruction \r\nefforts. \r\nOur assistance to Pacific SIDS exemplifies and \r\npromotes the spirit of South-South cooperation, and \r\nwe encourage others to join us in similar partnerships. \r\nIn that respect, Papua New Guinea has made modest \r\nfinancial contributions to Fiji, the Marshall Islands, \r\nNiue, Kiribati, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and \r\nVanuatu, as well as to various regional entities including \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum, the Secretariat of the Pacific \r\nCommunity, the South Pacific Regional Environment \r\nProgramme and the Melanesian Spearhead Group, to \r\nadd value to regional partnerships.\r\nThe Pacific region continues to attach critical \r\nimportance to ensuring the sustainable development, \r\nmanagement and conservation of the Pacific Ocean for \r\nour peoples’ livelihoods, food security and economic \r\ndevelopment. In this regard, we welcome SDG 14, on \r\nconservation and sustainable use of the oceans, seas \r\nand marine resources. We call upon development \r\npartners to assist us in addressing various challenges \r\nrelated to the oceans, including illegal, unregulated and \r\nunreported fishing in our territorial waters.\r\n24/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nClimate change poses imminent dangers with \r\nwide-ranging implications, including threats not only \r\nto human security, survival and development, but also \r\nto the entire global ecosystem. Our Climate Change \r\nManagement Act is possibly the first legislation of \r\nits kind in the Pacific islands. It provides for funding \r\narrangements to assist in the adaptation to climate \r\nchange.\r\nAlong with other Pacific island States, Papua New \r\nGuinea looks forward to the twenty-first session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \r\nin Paris and hopes that a new comprehensive and \r\nlegally binding climate agreement will be adopted to \r\nset the schedules for the reduction of carbon emissions \r\nfrom both the developed and developing world. The \r\nmost imminent threat resulting from sea level rise \r\ndue to climate change is the forced displacement \r\nof populations and complete inundation and loss of \r\nsovereign territories, particularly in Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States. We therefore call on the Security \r\nCouncil to deal decisively with the implications of \r\nclimate change and security issues.\r\nThe recent Pacific Island Forum summit in Port \r\nMoresby adopted the Pacific Island Forum Leaders \r\nDeclaration on Climate Change Action. Leaders were \r\ndeeply concerned about the serious effects and impacts \r\nof climate change, particularly on national and regional \r\ndevelopment and security issues. Among other things, \r\nthe Pacific island leaders declared that an increase \r\nof 1.5°C would severely exacerbate the particular \r\nchallenges facing the most vulnerable smaller island \r\nStates of the Pacific and urged that all efforts be made \r\nto keep us within the global temperature goal, as noted \r\nby the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC at its \r\ntwentieth session, in its decision 1/CP.20. \r\nThe 2015 Pacific Islands Forum Leaders \r\nDeclaration on Climate Change Action also expresses \r\nan expectation that there will be access to financial \r\nresources for climate change actions and resilience \r\nin vulnerable developing countries; recognition \r\nof the special circumstances and vulnerability of \r\nSIDS, particularly those in the Pacific, and the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs); support for inclusion \r\nin the Paris outcome document of loss and damage \r\nas a critical and stand-alone element, building on the \r\nongoing work of the Warsaw International Mechanism \r\nfor Loss and Damage; and finally, recognition of \r\nimpacts of climate change on women and youth, the \r\nelderly, the disabled, indigenous peoples and other \r\nvulnerable and marginalized groups, acknowledging \r\ntheir contributions to effective implementation of the \r\nParis outcome document.\r\nLet us not leave anyone — particularly those of \r\nus in SIDS and LDCs — behind, drowning. We must \r\nstrive to come together in accordance with the rule of \r\nlaw for a better, more secure and prosperous world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this \r\nmeeting. \r\nSeveral representatives have asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Ahmad (Pakistan): We have requested the \r\nf loor in response to India’s statement in the general \r\ndebate (see A/70/PV.22). \r\nIndia’s attempts to deny its illegal occupation \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir are a travesty of history. To \r\nperpetuate its occupation, India has deployed over \r\n700,000 troops in Indian-occupied Jammu and Kashmir. \r\nOnly the occupier would oppose the implementation \r\nof Security Council resolutions that promised self-\r\ndetermination to the people of the disputed State of \r\nJammu and Kashmir. \r\nOver 100,000 Kashmiris have been killed. \r\nThousands of women have been widowed and raped and \r\nthousands of children orphaned by this brutal occupation \r\nand the most egregious form of State terrorism by \r\nIndia. Independent human rights organizations have \r\nconfirmed the existence of over 6,000 unnamed mass \r\ngraves in Indian-occuped Kashmir. If India had respect \r\nfor international law and moral courage, it would \r\nend its reign of terror, withdraw its troops and let the \r\nKashmiris freely decide their future in the United \r\nNations-mandated plebiscite promised to them by the \r\nresolutions of the Security Council. \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 47 (1948) of \r\n21 April 1948, 51 (1948) of 3 June 1948, 80 (1950) \r\nof 14 March 1950, 91 (1951) of 30 March 1951, 122 \r\n(1957) of 24 January 1957 and the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations Commission for India and Pakistan of \r\n13 August 1948 and 5 January 1949 declare that the \r\nfinal disposition of the State of Jammu and Kashmir \r\n15-29876 25/26\r\n01/10/2015 A/70/PV.24\r\nwould be made in accordance with the will of the people \r\nexpressed through the democratic method of a free and \r\nimpartial plebiscite conducted under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations. The people of Jammu and Kashmir \r\nawait fulfilment of that promise.\r\nThe core issue of Jammu and Kashmir cannot be cast \r\naside by empty rhetoric. It has been and will always be \r\nat the top of the agenda of any talks between India and \r\nPakistan. That is because durable peace and stability \r\nin the region depend on a just and lasting settlement \r\nof this dispute, in accordance with the resolutions of \r\nthe Security Council. It is therefore disingenuous of \r\nIndia to ignore the serious peace initiative proposed by \r\nthe Prime Minister of Pakistan from this rostrum (see \r\nA/70/PV.19). \r\nWhile proclaiming its willingness to talk, India \r\nhas imposed preconditions, knowing that they would \r\nbe unacceptable to Pakistan. India’s insistence on \r\nlimiting the talks to a one-point agenda proves that it is \r\nneither interested nor serious in engaging in a genuine \r\ndialogue. Using the terrorism bogey, India has not \r\nonly stalled the bilateral dialogue but also vitiated the \r\noverall atmosphere between the two countries. \r\nPakistan’s commitment and its role and sacrifices \r\nin the fight against terrorism, including the success of \r\nour ongoing counter-terrorism operations, have been \r\nacknowledged and praised by the entire international \r\ncommunity. The entire world, with the exception of \r\nIndia, is also united in unequivocally condemning \r\nterrorism. India is insensitive to the tragic human \r\ndimension of terrorism. It seems to suggest that acts of \r\nterrorism in Pakistan are acceptable. By doing so, India \r\nin fact seeks to mask its own support and sponsorship \r\nof terrorism in Pakistan.\r\nIndia has also failed to bring to justice the \r\nperpetrators of terrorism against innocent civilians in \r\nthe 2007 Samjhauta Express bombings. The decision \r\nof the Indian Government not to challenge the bail \r\ngranted to Swami Aseemanand, the man accused in the \r\ncase, raises serious doubts about India’s willingness \r\nto convict its nationals involved in terrorist incidents \r\nagainst Muslims. That is a continuation of the sad saga \r\nof the massacre of Muslims in Gujarat.\r\nPakistan has today handed over to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral dossiers containing evidence of Indian \r\ninvolvement in terrorism and fomenting instability \r\nin Pakistan. The dossiers include details of Indian \r\ninterference and support for terrorism in Balochistan \r\nand Karachi, as well as of its security and intelligence \r\nagencies linked with the Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, \r\nespecially in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas.\r\nThe international community supports dialogue \r\nbetween India and Pakistan. Despite India’s hostile \r\nattitude, it remains our desire to move forward in an \r\nopen and constructive manner. Our Prime Minister’s \r\npeace initiative is in line with his vision of a friendly \r\nneighbourhood that he enunciated immediately after \r\ntaking office two years ago. We hope that India \r\nwill respond positively in the interest of peace and \r\nprosperity — the cherished collective objectives of our \r\npeoples.\r\nMrs. Vadiati (Islamic Republic of Iran): Once \r\nmore, the representative of the Israeli regime (see \r\nA/70/PV.22) demonstrated clearly how much he grieves \r\nthe loss of the smokescreen that he needed to use for \r\nhiding his regime’s crimes and atrocities against the \r\nPalestinian people and how much he regrets the nuclear \r\ndeal between Iran and the P5+1, which is harmful to his \r\nschemes. He allocated the major part of his speech to \r\nattacking all members of the international community \r\nfor their strong support for the nuclear deal, a deal that \r\njust removes one layer of tension from the very tense \r\nMiddle East. He and his cronies expected to continue \r\nbasking in the happiness of keeping everybody busy \r\nwith the phony issue while they continue to keep \r\nPalestine under their occupation and brutally suppress \r\nany resistance.\r\nThe support that the Israeli regime provides to the \r\nelements of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham in \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan and the vicinity is further \r\nevidence that they wish to keep all tensions high in the \r\nregion and to stoke them. They wish to keep tensions \r\nrising because peace and stability in the region is an \r\nexistential threat to them. If the region becomes quiet, \r\nthey will be back in the spotlight and will need to \r\nexplain why they keep expanding illegal settlements \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory while pretending \r\nto have been engaged with them in the so-called peace \r\nprocess for the past 25 years without any results. \r\nMoreover, the Israeli regime and its cronies in \r\nmany countries did whatever was in their power to \r\nprevent Governments from supporting the nuclear \r\ndeal, and they utterly failed. In that context, it is quite \r\nunderstandable why the Israeli representative was so \r\nangry and shamefully insulted the representatives of \r\nthe nations represented in the Assembly Hall and the \r\nwhole international community.\r\n26/26 15-29876\r\nA/70/PV.24 01/10/2015\r\nMy Government is committed to faithfully \r\nimplementing its obligations under the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action and, with the help of \r\nthe international community, to restoring stability and \r\npeace to our region. In that light, we will surely see \r\nmore annoyed and angry representatives of the Israeli \r\nregime year after year in the Assembly. The angrier \r\nthey are, the calmer our region will be.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8.45 p.m.\r\n"
