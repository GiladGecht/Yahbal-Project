If we have talked about \r\nthose themes for so long, perhaps that is because \r\nsomething has not been going as planned. Perhaps the \r\ninternational community has not done well and has \r\nbeen unable to make sufficient progress in promoting \r\nthe values  that are part of the philosophy and charisma \r\nof the United Nations. Clearly, with the United Nations, \r\nthe international community has made unprecedented \r\nprogress. However, to recognize that not all has gone \r\nsmoothly and that there is much room for improvement \r\nis the first step towards meeting present and future \r\nchallenges in a realistic and effective manner.\r\nThe world has changed a great deal in the past \r\n70 years. Seven decades ago, the international \r\ncommunity came to an agreement to prevent a third \r\nworld war that would have devastated the future of \r\nhumankind. To prevent that, the major Powers were \r\nable to choose consensus and harmony over unilaterally \r\nimposing their own order, because solutions that are \r\nconcerted, balanced and fair are much more lasting \r\nthan those imposed through coercion or the unilateral \r\nuse of power.\r\nAs we heard President Obama say a few days ago \r\nbefore the Assembly (see A/70/PV.13), no country \r\ncan claim to solve the world’s problems unilaterally, \r\nand no country can remain isolated and think that the \r\nproblems affecting the rest of the world will not affect \r\nit. A country as small as Andorra understands, perhaps \r\nbetter than others, the deeper meaning of those words.\r\nOver the past 70 years, Andorra has made the \r\ntransition from isolation to openness. Seven decades \r\nago, our country was only beginning to overcome its \r\ncloistered past. For centuries Andorra was a reclusive \r\ncountry, surrounded by its mountains — both isolated \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.25\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n25th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 2 October 2015, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nand protected by its environment. The construction of \r\nroads that connected us with the neighbouring regions \r\nof France and Spain were the way we overcame our \r\nisolation. Thanks to that geographical opening, various \r\nsectors developed in Andorra, such as tourism, trade \r\nand finance. That provided opportunities to the local \r\npopulation, as well as to the thousands of people from \r\nneighbouring countries who sought new opportunities \r\nin our country and who have helped enrich the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra and make it greater.\r\nAndorra’s history is the history of its ongoing \r\nadaptation to its environment. It is also the history \r\nof continuous change. In the 1980s and 1990s, my \r\ncountry aligned its institutional systems to others. That \r\ntoo was a change and an opening. In my generation, \r\nour mission has been to open up and harmonize our \r\neconomic system. Three years ago, we proposed and \r\napproved an economic law that removed restrictions \r\non foreign investment and conferred full economic \r\nrights to foreign nationals starting on their first day of \r\nresidency. In parallel with that, Andorra has opted for \r\ncooperation and transparency. We have approved a new \r\nfiscal model that is in line with others. We have made \r\nand will continue to make progress in exchanging tax \r\ninformation, and we have begun to build a network for \r\ndouble taxation agreements.\r\nThe world is changing, and Andorra must change \r\nwith the world. We have chosen to become a more \r\nopen, more competitive and more transparent country, \r\nbecause we are convinced that increasing economic ties \r\namong countries is a way to establish the foundations of \r\na more cooperative, more just and more peaceful world. \r\nThat was in fact the spirit that guided the construction \r\nof the European Union over the past 60 years. \r\nAndorra is currently negotiating an Association \r\nAgreement with the European Union that establishes a \r\nstable horizon for opportunities and prosperity for our \r\ncitizens. We do so in the same spirit of cooperation, \r\nhealthy competition and transparency that we have \r\nbrought to our economic reforms in recent years. \r\nAndorra needs broader horizons than those fixed by \r\nour mountains, and that will also happen through the \r\nEuropean Union. To opt for a more interrelated and open \r\nworld, with stronger economic, cultural and social ties \r\namong nations, is also to opt for peace and harmony. As \r\nPresident Obama said yesterday, the great challenges of \r\nour time, including economic ones, must be addressed \r\njointly, and that is what we our trying to do in Andorra.\r\nAndorra believes that after its first 70 years, the \r\nUnited Nations also should promote a process of reform. \r\nThat is why we have supported the political declaration \r\non suspending the right to the veto in the Security \r\nCouncil in cases of mass atrocities, an initiative that has \r\nbeen and is being promoted by the French Republic and \r\nthe United Mexican States. It is important that France, \r\nas a permanent member of the Security Council, is part \r\nof that initiative. \r\nHere, I would like to commend France’s initiative, \r\nas expressed on Monday through President Hollande \r\n(see A/70/PV.13). France could retain the major \r\nPowers’ right to the veto, but it understands that that \r\nright should be moderated under certain circumstances, \r\nbecause institutions are here to serve the values, and \r\nnot the reverse. And international institutions should \r\nbe at the service of people and the universal values of \r\npeace, solidarity and justice.\r\nIn extreme situations, when the survival of \r\nthousands of people is at stake, the international \r\ncommunity cannot remain deadlocked. The balances \r\nthat gave birth to the United Nations cannot be used \r\nto excuse deadlock in situations that are extreme for \r\nhumankind. The citizens of this great global city that \r\nis the world demand solutions, and institutions must \r\nalways be part of the solution, not part of the problem. \r\nThat is why we must address the matter of Security \r\nCouncil reform. We must move the United Nations \r\nforward, adapt it to the changing times and reform it \r\nto improve it, without making radical changes yet in a \r\nresolute, effective way. We need to do that now, without \r\nwaiting for another humanitarian crisis or a new \r\nstalemate to reveal our shortcomings and weaknesses.\r\nIn extreme situations such as that in Syria during \r\nrecent years, the international community must be \r\nable to provide effective and fair responses. And, let \r\nus say clearly, so far we have been unable to do that. \r\nThat creates an image of frustration and impotence that \r\nwe should avoid. When there is a massacre, there is no \r\nmiddle ground: one is either part of the problem or one \r\nis part of the solution. The international community \r\nmust always be part of the solution. The consequence \r\nof our failure to respond in time to the crisis in Syria \r\nis obvious every day on Europe’s borders, where \r\nthousands of refugees arrive in f light from massacres. \r\nThis is not a migration phenomenon motivated by \r\nsocioeconomic factors. What we are seeing is an exodus \r\nof people f leeing war and f leeing death. They are not \r\nseeking a better life; they are seeking simply to live. \r\n15-29816 3/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nAnd that calls directly and bluntly to the very essence \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAndorra is committed and sensitive to the situation \r\nwe are witnessing in Syria. That is why the Government \r\nthat I have the honour to head has decided to join the \r\neffort to host refugees. Our country wants to be faithful \r\nto its tradition of hospitality and integration, and we \r\nwant to be part of the solution — a balanced solution \r\nagreed in the European framework because, once again, \r\nglobal problems require global solutions. Andorra, from \r\nits modest position, will be part of that global solution. \r\nThe desperate cry of refugees, wherever they may come \r\nfrom, calls us all. It is sad that the developed countries \r\nhave taken longer to react than have those less favoured. \r\nAs we heard on Monday from President Hollande, it is \r\nthe least developed countries that have most quickly \r\nwelcomed the refugees f leeing the war and the tyranny \r\nof the various conflicts that unfortunately affect many \r\nplaces on our planet.\r\nBecause we in the more developed countries have \r\nbeen slower to react, we must move decisively to enact \r\nreforms that guarantee that an atrocity such as that in \r\nSyria will not be repeated. Governments need to carry \r\nout forward-looking policies. In the international arena \r\nalso, the best policy for promoting peace is clearly \r\nconflict prevention. Accordingly, Andorra commends \r\nthe recent agreement between the United States and \r\nIran on the nuclear issue, which shows that no matter \r\nhow far apart positions may be, there is always room for \r\ncooperation and harmony.\r\nThe fact that we are a small country is not in any \r\nway incompatible with the fight against atrocities of \r\nwar. In that connection, Andorra accepted the Kampala \r\namendments, a text that defines the crime of aggression \r\nand establishes the conditions in which the International \r\nCriminal Court can exercise jurisdiction over such \r\ncrimes so that they do not go unpunished.\r\nSome years ago, in this very Hall, in speaking about \r\nthe conflicts in Libya and Syria, we discussed whether \r\neffectiveness or justice was preferable in resolving \r\nconflicts. That is an open question, but I believe that \r\nthe way in which events have unfolded demonstrates \r\nthat it is an artificial debate. We must be both effective \r\nand just, because justice, if not effective, is just a pretty \r\nword. And effectiveness without justice winds up being \r\nineffective. As His Holiness Pope Francis said from this \r\nrostrum last month (see A/70/PV.3), justice is a will that \r\nis effective, practical and constant, with concrete steps \r\nand immediate measures.\r\nThere are no lasting solutions without justice. \r\nIn that regard, regimes and tyrants who continue to \r\nperpetrate massacres and repeatedly violate human \r\nrights cannot be part of the solution, because they are \r\nultimately part of the problem. The victims of conflicts \r\ncannot live knowing that they have not been taken care \r\nof adequately by the international community.\r\nFrom the time of its founding, the fundamental \r\ngoal of the United Nations has been the promotion of \r\npeace and the prevention of conflicts. The founders \r\nsoon realized, however, that peace and justice cannot \r\nbe disassociated from education, opportunities, social \r\nrights and the rational and sustainable use of the \r\nenvironment. Andorra has accordingly committed \r\nitself to other fields such as education and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nOur country has long experience in welcoming \r\nimmigrants and in dealing with diversity. Proof of \r\nthat can be seen in our educational system, which \r\nincorporates the French, Spanish and Andorran \r\neducational systems and has resulted in a trilingual \r\nsociety, prepared for a global world. On that account, \r\nour country has become meaningfully involved in \r\nthe Global Education First initiative, promoted by the \r\nSecretary-General, which advocates universal primary \r\neducation, quality teaching and the promotion of global \r\ncitizenship. We must always bear in mind the values \r\nthat are part of that initiative.\r\nThe need to tackle problems from a global \r\nperspective is more apparent than ever in environmental \r\nconcerns. There are problems that we can attempt to \r\nsolve unilaterally, and we might achieve an imperfect \r\nand short-term solution. Global warming is not one of \r\nthose problems. Either there will be a global solution, \r\nor there will be no solution at all. That is why we cannot \r\nlose sight of the notion of global citizenship within \r\na global village, which President Dilma Rousseff \r\nevoked in her opening statement in the Assembly (see \r\nA/70/PV.13). Small countries such as ours perhaps \r\nbetter understand the notion of a global village, for \r\nAndorra is both a country and a village. Who better \r\nthan we can act on the slogan that says we must think \r\nglobally and act locally?\r\nAs a small country, it is clear that Andorra needs \r\nits natural environment and the help of others to reverse \r\nthe situation and resolve issues. In Andorra, the effects \r\nof global warming concern and affect us in a very \r\nspecific way. The average temperature in the Pyrenees \r\nis rising at a rate of 0.2°C per decade, and precipitation \r\n4/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nhas been annually decreasing by 2 litres per square \r\nmetre. Experts’ calculations predict that by 2050, our \r\nwater reserves will be reduced by 18 per cent. Those \r\nstatistics are of particular concern to a country that \r\nlives on the tourism of snow and of mountains.\r\nThe major climate change agreements must be \r\nintegrated into the national policies of every country. For \r\nsome time Andorra has been working in that direction, \r\nand in recent years we have seen the improvement of \r\nall environmental indicators. But we also know that \r\nthe reach of national policies is reduced, especially in \r\na country like ours. We need global solutions that can \r\nbe applied locally. For that reason, Andorra was one \r\nof the first countries to make its national contribution \r\nto the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change to be \r\nheld in Paris in December. Andorra has committed \r\nto reducing its emissions of carbon dioxide and other \r\ngreenhouse gases by 37 per cent by 2030. That metric \r\nplaces us within the global commitment to ensure that \r\nthe increase in global average temperature remains \r\nbelow 2°C.\r\nWe endorse the statement made by President \r\nHollande in urging countries that have not yet submitted \r\ntheir contribution to the Conference of the Parties to do \r\nso by December. At the Conference, we must provide \r\nthe international community with the necessary tools \r\nto be able to confront the tremendous environmental \r\nchallenges of the future and come away with a new \r\nparadigm for the energy and environmental policies \r\nof every country. At times, within the international \r\ncommunity it seems as though there is little sensitivity \r\nto national problems and that national policies lack a \r\nglobal vision. As our fellow leader and President of \r\nthe French Republic said, if in Paris we put off finding \r\nsolutions, later will be too late. The citizens of the \r\nnations we represent are calling on us. We cannot allow \r\nfailure to reach an effective and definitive agreement \r\nin Paris.\r\nSeventy years ago, the world was coming out of a \r\nhalf-century marked by two world wars. It was a world \r\nof delicate balances. This is not the time for balances, \r\nbut rather for firm commitments. It is time to forge \r\nmore policies among nations and leave behind disunity \r\nin decision-making. For seven decades, the United \r\nNations has been the guarantor of peace, human rights, \r\njustice and sustainable development. When it is time to \r\ntake a determined decision, each country and each ruler \r\nknows that the international community and the world \r\nare watching. As representatives of the international \r\ncommunity, we must also be aware that the world is \r\nwatching us and that our decisions will be judged by \r\nfuture generations. To those future generations we must \r\nleave a more just, prosperous, peaceful and sustainable \r\nworld.\r\nFor 70 years, heads of State, prime ministers and \r\nministers have stood and spoken at this rostrum. They \r\nhave done so to talk about peace and promoting human \r\nrights and justice. There will come a day when we will \r\nno longer need to defend those values so vehemently, \r\nbecause we will have made them into a reality.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nHead of Government of the Principality of Andorra for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nikola Gruevski, President \r\nof the Government of the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nof the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia.\r\nMr. Nikola Gruevski, President of the Government \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Nikola \r\nGruevski, President of the Government of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and inviting him to \r\naddress the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Gruevski (the former Yugoslav Republic \r\nof Macedonia) (spoke in Macedonian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): It is my \r\nprivilege to participate in the general debate in the \r\nyear in which we mark the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe establishment of the United Nations, the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Beijing Conference, a decade and a \r\nhalf since the adoption of the Millennium Declaration \r\n(resolution 55/2) and a decade since the 2005 World \r\nSummit.\r\nSince 1945 and the end of the devastating war \r\nthat took the lives of more than 50 million people, \r\n15-29816 5/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nthe United Nations, firmly committed to promoting \r\nfreedom from want and fear, has established itself as a \r\ndetermined and driving force behind the international \r\ncommunity and positive changes in the world. Critics \r\nof the United Nations mission say we live in a world \r\nin which conflicts in many regions are perpetuating \r\nand affecting the lives of millions while new conflicts \r\nemerge and affect the lives of millions more; a world \r\nwhere arms proliferation jeopardizes innocent lives and \r\nundermines economic development; a world of extreme \r\npoverty, lacking a collective will to agree on the issues \r\naffecting us all, such as climate change. We live in a \r\nworld with tens of millions of refugees and displaced \r\npersons.\r\nDespite all of that, I do not think that the United \r\nNations has failed in its mission. On the contrary, it \r\nhas resolved or mitigated difficult situations and issues \r\nthat no one could handle alone, and it continues to do \r\nso. That is why we gather regularly here in New York \r\nto discuss and develop instruments that demonstrate \r\nhow the United Nations can better cope with various \r\nexisting and emerging challenges. The failures do \r\nnot fall only on our Organization, but predominantly \r\non Member States, due to a lack of political will, and \r\nsometimes courage, to take bold but essential decisions.\r\nOur common efforts with regard to human rights \r\nshould focus on reinforcing the system that guarantees \r\nhuman rights both individually and collectively. \r\nWe should support endeavours aimed at ensuring \r\nthe protection of human rights as the essence of the \r\nstrategies and operational activities of the United \r\nNations. What we need for the present and for the \r\nfuture is for the United Nations to continue to exercise \r\nits global leadership role for the benefit of mankind. In \r\nthat context it is encouraging that the Member States \r\ndecided to give a greater role to the General Assembly \r\nin the upcoming election of the next Secretary-General. \r\nGiven the fact that no Secretary-General has ever been \r\nelected from the Group of Eastern European States, we \r\nstand firmly in support of our Group’s request in that \r\nregard.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia remains a staunch \r\nsupporter of multilateralism with the United Nations at \r\nits heart, and believes in the benefits of multilateralism \r\nto the world. It remains the core principle of our foreign \r\npolicy.\r\nWhile we live in an era of unprecedented technology, \r\nwith immense innovations that make our lives easier \r\nand with examples of the dedication of the scientific \r\ncommunity, such as the work on the Ebola vaccine \r\nthat brought hope and a possible cure, humankind is \r\nstill confronted with issues that threaten international \r\npeace and stability. They threaten our development and \r\nprosperity, and they threaten our future.\r\nIn this ever more globalized world, where today’s \r\nnews is already in the past, where no one individual is \r\nisolated from the problems of the others, we need a bold \r\nshift in our policies. To resolve problems, the policies \r\nof commitment, cooperation and wisdom should be \r\nour common choice, with a proactive approach and \r\nmaximum engagement. High moral standards must be \r\nthe main pillars that articulate a new world reality. In \r\ntheir essence they embody freedom and human rights \r\nand solidarity for humankind. The United Nations \r\nmust continue with this principle in mind: to protect \r\ndemocracy.\r\nThose standards must remain at the heart of our \r\nnew policies today, and we must keep this solidarity \r\nin mind. That is essential. The past 70 years of United \r\nNations experience have led us to understand that all \r\nMember States must be committed to the process of \r\nUnited Nations reform. The future world should be \r\nmultipolar and avoid the senseless wars that have caused \r\nso many nations to suffer. We should face reality and \r\nprepare the future for the coming generations.\r\nThe region of South-East Europe is now entering a \r\nphase of positive development, and, in general, national \r\nand regional primary objectives have been fulfilled or \r\nare within reach. Despite that progress, it is clear that \r\ncertain longstanding unresolved or partially resolved \r\nbilateral issues are negatively affecting our present and \r\non our near future. The Republic of Macedonia is facing \r\nan open dispute that has become a serious obstacle to \r\nour integration in international organizations. That \r\ndispute presents an obstacle to progress in building \r\ncapacity aimed at preventing breakdowns in stability in \r\ntimes of great global stress.\r\nOur region faces two key strategic and global \r\nchallenges. The first is the refugee and migrant crisis, \r\nand the second and more dangerous one concerns the \r\naspirations of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS) to penetrate to a greater extent into Europe, \r\nwhich brings with it a more serious danger to European \r\neconomies and to sustainable development. Even worse, \r\nthe ISIS agenda is to destroy societies that are based on \r\nuniversal values and principles protected by the United \r\nNations.\r\n6/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nToday, not just my country, but the whole of the \r\nBalkans and Europe are faced with thousands of \r\nrefugees — children, women, elderly people and entire \r\nfamilies who are f leeing the bloodshed in their home \r\ncountries. Since the beginning of 2015, nearly 200,000 \r\npeople, mainly Syrians, have transited through the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia. Syria’s neighbours Lebanon, \r\nTurkey and Jordan are also heavily affected. The first \r\nsigns of that heavy social burden are now being felt in \r\nthe Balkan countries, whose economies cannot cope \r\nwith the situation on their own.\r\nFor our part, we will do everything in our power \r\nto help those people who have needs and people who \r\nseek peace and cherish the hope for safe travel and \r\nfor a safe and decent life. Regardless of the economic \r\nand sustainability aspects, we are trying to help them \r\nby overcoming certain weaknesses in the established \r\nsystem, with a strong commitment to contributing to \r\nthe creation of positive solutions for the people based \r\non their needs. However, we cannot do the job alone. \r\nThe problem requires stronger engagement from \r\nthe European Union in cooperation with the Balkan \r\ncountries. Such a commitment would also be quite \r\nsignificant for the enhancement of cooperation on other \r\npractical levels.\r\nIn that manner, the challenge we face will have some \r\npositive effects. Besides helping the people in need, it \r\nwill also mean significant improvements in standards \r\nin the Balkan countries and the implementation of \r\nEuropean values and approaches through cooperation \r\non solutions. What is also crucial — indeed the only way \r\nto resolve the refugee crisis — is for Europe to urgently \r\naddress the main reason for their suffering — in this \r\ncase, the Syrian conflict. The existing differences with \r\nregard to solutions must be put aside. We need unity \r\nand a concerted United Nations and Security Council \r\nposition, such as, for example, that which achieved \r\npositive results in the agreement on the elimination \r\nof Syria’s chemical weapons, a situation in which \r\ndiplomacy accomplished a great victory.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East is growing worse. \r\nThe appearance of ISIS has worsened the situation even \r\nmore. The security situation, aggravated by the presence \r\nof foreign fighters, has brought a new challenge for us in \r\ndealing with religious intolerance and extreme hatred. \r\nISIS is not a threat only to the Middle East but is a \r\nglobal threat to which no country is immune, especially \r\nthe countries of South-East Europe, where there is a \r\nbigger risk of greater penetration by ISIS and of greater \r\ninfluence on the population. Those facts can have very \r\nserious consequences, leading to the destabilization of \r\nmulti-ethnic societies. That is why peace in the Middle \r\nEast in particular is an issue of the utmost importance. \r\nThe P5+1 agreement with Iran is a positive development \r\nfor the region, since it serves as a model that could be \r\nfollowed for the situation in Syria.\r\nWe need to pursue a policy of prevention, which is \r\nprecisely what we have been discussing in the United \r\nNations and in our region. That is why, through the joint \r\nefforts of the United Nations in the collective security \r\narea, especially the security services within the region, \r\nwe must prevent the manifestation of extremism in the \r\nregion by heading off isolated conflicts or efforts to \r\ndestabilize the region. Actions to repress the core ISIS \r\nforces are a positive step forward. But we must also \r\ncontinue to address the populations in the region, based \r\non social inclusion and the values of the United Nations, \r\nbecause extremist groups target them for recruitment.\r\nSouth-East Europe must tighten its security \r\narrangements and move forward to solve outstanding \r\nquestions in accordance with the principles of the United \r\nNations. That strategic effort must be an urgent priority \r\nfor the United Nations. The Republic of Macedonia \r\nremains a positive, instructive actor, seeking to make a \r\npositive contribution to good neighbourly relations and \r\nregional cooperation in ways that unite cooperation \r\nwith security. This year, our country is serving as the \r\nPresident of the Central European Initiative, and we are \r\nfocusing on promoting regional interconnections and \r\nthe development of infrastructure connections. \r\nThe main strategic and foreign policy priority of the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia remains our membership in the \r\nEuropean Union and in NATO. All reforms undertaken \r\nin the country bear that goal in mind. All problems are \r\nbeing resolved in that spirit. Despite the challenges we \r\nface, allow me to stress that we expect no obstacles on \r\nour path to the North Atlantic community.\r\nOne unanswered question relating to the permanent \r\nstability of our region that directly influences my \r\ncountry and remains on the United Nations agenda is \r\nthe difference we have with Greece on the name of my \r\ncountry, that is, the difference we have with regard to \r\nour constitutional name, the Republic of Macedonia. \r\nResolving that issue with our neighbour is a priority \r\nthat should be pursued in accordance with the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions and international law, which \r\nare defined. We seek discussions on a mutually agreed \r\nsolution.\r\n15-29816 7/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nOur position is clear. There is the reality that we are \r\nMacedonians, that we speak the Macedonian language \r\nand that we live in a country whose constitutional name \r\nis the Republic of Macedonia. International law must be \r\nabided by all and in all cases, not just in certain cases. \r\nThat is why the decision of the International Court of \r\nJustice, handed down in favour of my country, must be \r\nrespected by all Members of the Organization, precisely \r\nbecause the Court was founded by the United Nations \r\nand must be seen as a guarantor of the execution of the \r\nlaw and the bilateral agreements concluded under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations. Otherwise, trust in the \r\nUnited Nations will fall and sceptics who attack the \r\nvalidity of the Organization will gain strength.\r\nIn the 25 years since gaining independence, \r\nmy country, the Republic of Macedonia, has seen \r\na transformation of its region and of Europe. The \r\nimpression has arisen, unfortunately, both in my \r\ncountry and elsewhere, that the United Nations \r\nis resisting dealing with our problem and is even \r\nan obstacle to progress on that and other issues in \r\nmy country. Such an approach by the international \r\ncommunity can set precedents and can, unfortunately, \r\nbe easily manipulated to cause broad instability. \r\nSerious commitment is required if Greece is going to \r\nbe motivated to improve its performance on the issue.\r\nIts inertia stems, at least partly, from its economic \r\nproblems.\r\nThe international community’s failure to focus on \r\nmy country has allowed key players to give minimum \r\npriority to the issue. As two friendly nations that, \r\nexcept for this issue, do not have any other problems \r\nwith each other, we have to find a solution. We must \r\nrespect and talk to each other and cooperate with each \r\nother in a positive spirit of friendship and cooperation \r\nwith all countries in the region. My country will work \r\ntowards that end, both for its own sake and for the sake \r\nof the region.\r\nAs we have done before, I would like to call \r\nupon the new Government in Greece, in the spirit of \r\nthe good-neighbourly relations, to resolve this issue \r\nas neighbours, respecting the 1995 Interim Accord \r\nbetween Greece and the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, which is the cornerstone of our relations. \r\nThe Accord is an agreement made under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations, and it by now should have brought \r\nabout a resolution of the dispute, not its postponement. \r\nWe have recently developed a new approach that \r\nshould take us forward and create a positive climate \r\nfor resolving the issue. I hope that that approach will \r\nbe pursued with the new Greek Government and that \r\nprejudices can be overcome.\r\nToday’s generation of politicians should use the \r\nAccord, which was created 24 years ago as a purely \r\npolitical instrument and a road map. We need to move \r\ntowards a commonly agreed solution supported by the \r\ncitizens of both countries, which, while helping the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia to move forward, will be a \r\npositive step for Greece and contribute to the positive \r\natmosphere in the region. Such a solution will strengthen \r\nthe region, so that it can deal with the challenges posed \r\nby radical elements and provide a better response to \r\nhumanitarian crises.\r\nWe seek a permanent resolution of the issue, \r\none that opens economic possibilities in the form of \r\nincreased investment in our countries and the region. \r\nWe must expand our ambitions to include large-scale \r\ninfrastructure projects that involve the efforts of several \r\ncountries and that will lead to growth in the economies \r\nof all countries in the region and the creation of tens of \r\nthousands of new jobs. Similarly, we will move forward \r\non the strategic goal of lowering unemployment in our \r\ncountry, which has been a fundamental goal in my \r\npolitical life.\r\nMany of us have had great economic successes in the \r\npast year. Although I may not sound humble in saying \r\nso, my country is one of the economic surprises of the \r\npast few years. We have attracted a lot of investment, \r\nincluding investments in large-scale projects, which \r\nhas accelerated the economic progress of our citizens, \r\ndeveloped education and improved standards in almost \r\nevery sphere, which will naturally benefit the country \r\nand the region.\r\nI would reiterate once again here, from this \r\nrostrum, as we invoke the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations, that it is incumbent on my \r\ncountry and our neighbour to the south to make full \r\nuse of international law and justice so as to responsibly \r\nresolve the outstanding issue between us. As we try to \r\novercome the issue for the sake of European values and \r\nour common future, the positions of both our countries \r\nmust nevertheless be respected.\r\nIn this anniversary year, under the leadership \r\nof President Lykketoft, the General Assembly will \r\naddress issues of critical importance for all of us. I \r\nwould like to emphasize our support for him and wish \r\nhim every success. The Republic of Macedonia will \r\n8/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\ncontinue to work together with all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations to strengthen international peace \r\nand security, promote human rights and achieve the \r\nglobal development goals.\r\nFinally, I would like to express our gratitude for \r\nthe Secretary-General’s leadership and tireless efforts \r\naimed at taking our Organization forward.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Nikola Gruevski, President of the Government \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Freundel Stuart, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for National Security, \r\nthe Public Service and Urban Development \r\nof Barbados\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for National Security, the Public \r\nService and Urban Development of Barbados.\r\nMr. Freundel Stuart, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nNational Security, the Public Service and Urban \r\nDevelopment of Barbados, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Freundel Stuart, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nNational Security, the Public Service and Urban \r\nDevelopment of Barbados, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Stuart (Barbados): I would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election \r\nto the presidency of General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. He represents a country, Denmark, whose \r\nservice to the United Nations and the global community \r\nhas been exemplary. I anticipate that in upholding \r\nthose fine traditions, Mr. Lykketoft will guide us \r\njudiciously as we embark on the journey towards the \r\nOrganization’s centenary. I assure him of Barbados’ \r\nfull support as we begin to implement the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), striving \r\ncollectively to address the diverse challenges that \r\nStates Members of the United Nations are facing. I also \r\ntake this opportunity to express the sincere admiration \r\nof my delegation for the sterling manner in which his \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, so ably \r\nguided the work of the General Assembly during its \r\nsixty-ninth session.\r\nThree score and ten years ago, 50 delegations, \r\nassisted by a temporary Secretariat, gathered in San \r\nFrancisco to sign the Charter that established the United \r\nNations. That was a moment whose consequences have \r\nbeen felt across space and time and resonate with a \r\nunique power to this day. Of course, Barbados, like the \r\noverwhelming majority of countries that today make \r\nup the United Nations, was not among the countries \r\nrepresented in San Francisco on 26 June 1945. Only \r\n50 delegations gathered then, representing, generally \r\nspeaking, the victors of the Second World War. In stark \r\ncontrast to that select group gathered on that summer \r\nday in 1945, the membership of this Organization \r\ntoday totals 193 States and represents virtually all of \r\nhumankind.\r\nIn Paris in December, 196 delegations, including \r\nthat of Barbados, will gather for the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nAt that meeting, we will agree on collective action \r\nthat will make possible the continued survival of our \r\nplanet. That is an existential issue for all countries, but \r\nin particular for those like mine that are small island \r\ndeveloping States. Our countries stand on the edge of \r\nthe yawning abyss opened up by climate change. For \r\nthose who framed the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe cessation of global wars was the single existential \r\nthreat. While that threat undeniably remains today, it \r\nwould be to our peril not to accord climate change the \r\nsame deadly capacity to threaten our planet.\r\nBarbados and all the countries of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity have made clear their views on what \r\nshould be the outcome of the twenty-first session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the Climate Change \r\nConvention. All parties should commit to taking \r\nindividual and collective action to curb greenhouse \r\ngas emissions in line with our ambitious goal to hold \r\nthe average global temperature increase to well below \r\n1.5°C above pre-industrial levels, and all parties should \r\ncommit to cooperating on taking such action and \r\nsubmitting to regular five-year cycles of reporting, \r\nverification and updating on mitigation commitments. \r\nAll parties should also commit to supporting the \r\nparticularly vulnerable countries, which are the small \r\nisland developing States and the least developed \r\n15-29816 9/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\ncountries. In short, we need an ambitious, high-\r\nperformance, legally binding agreement with global \r\nparticipation.\r\nThe tragedy that struck our sister Caribbean nation \r\nof Dominica, battered last month by Tropical Storm \r\nErika, highlights the urgency of an effective global \r\nresponse to climate change. As we have often seen, a \r\nsingle natural or man-made disaster in a small island \r\ndeveloping State can have catastrophic economic, \r\ninfrastructural and humanitarian effects on a national \r\nscale, It has been estimated that the damage caused by \r\nErika set Dominica’s development back by 20 years. As \r\nChairman of the Conference of Heads of Government \r\nof the Caribbean Community, I take this opportunity \r\nto express the region’s unwavering solidarity with and \r\ncommitment to our brothers and sisters in Dominica, \r\nand I call on the international community to continue \r\nto help Dominica in its hour of need.\r\nHistory is a superb teacher. Seventy years on from \r\nthe creation of the United Nations, it is appropriate that \r\nwe reflect on the path that small States like mine have \r\nhelped to prepare. It is a path made possible in large part \r\nby the principles that this Organization has embraced \r\nfrom its inception, which are embodied in the Charter \r\nand in the many treaties, resolutions and plans of action \r\nof the United Nations. It is a path from exclusivity to \r\nuniversality, a path that has seen a near quadrupling \r\nof the Organization’s membership in 70 years, and a \r\npath towards an international legal order that seeks to \r\nbalance the rights of States with their responsibilities, \r\nincluding their responsibilities to their citizens.\r\nWithout question, those changes combine to \r\nreflect a significant and positive transformation of \r\nthe international system — a transformation that has \r\nseen the country that I have the honour to represent \r\nmove from subordination under colonial status to full \r\nsovereignty. In 2016, Barbados will proudly celebrate \r\nthe fiftieth year of its independence and its membership \r\nin the United Nations. The United Nations has provided \r\na forum where all countries, irrespective of their size or \r\ngeopolitical influence, can meet, discuss and sometimes \r\nargue, always on an equal footing.\r\nThe transformation of the United Nations has \r\nprovided the necessary but hardly the sufficient \r\nconditions for the Organization to realize the \r\nextraordinary promise expressed in the Preamble \r\nand Article 1 of the Charter. Member States have by \r\nand large failed to eliminate the scourge of war, and \r\nrelations among nations are not everywhere friendly. \r\nInternational cooperation has not, by itself, solved many \r\ninternational economic, social, cultural or humanitarian \r\nproblems, nor has it everywhere encouraged respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. The United \r\nNations has not proven able to harmonize the actions \r\nof nations in the attainment of those common ends. \r\nAnd for small developing countries in particular, the \r\npromised emphasis on development has yet to be fully \r\nrealized.\r\nDevelopment is a plant of tender growth and cannot \r\nf lourish in an environment where there is no peace. \r\nIt is therefore heartening to learn of the reduction of \r\ntensions between the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nand the Cooperative Republic of Guyana, which was \r\nfacilitated by the Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations. Over the years the tensions between those two \r\ncountries had the effect of stymying the development \r\npotential of Guyana. I should like to take advantage of \r\nthis opportunity to express my country’s unwavering \r\ncommitment to the territorial integrity of Guyana and \r\nto state our support for a juridical solution to a dispute \r\nthat has lasted far too long.\r\nIs it permissible to inquire whether the world is \r\na safer and more peaceful place today than it was in \r\n1945? While there have been no world wars of the kind \r\nthat precipitated the founding of this Organization, \r\nproxy wars and internecine, fratricidal conflicts have \r\nproliferated. The United Nations has registered many \r\nsuccesses in addressing the myriad challenges to peace \r\nand security that have confronted the international \r\ncommunity over the past 70 years. However, as Member \r\nStates, it is our responsibility, and ours alone, to ensure \r\nthat the United Nations is equipped and empowered to \r\ndo much more.\r\nLike many around the world, we in the Caribbean \r\nare deeply concerned about the connected crises of \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons. We regret \r\nthat the international community has failed to take the \r\nfirm political action necessary to bring those crises to \r\nan end. We underscore that if people are able to live in \r\npeace and security and in an environment that respects \r\ntheir human rights, they will feel less compelled to \r\nf lee their countries, which they have often done under \r\nconditions that place their lives, and those of their \r\nchildren, in peril. We cannot afford to be indifferent. \r\nAs Nobel Laureate Elie Wiesel has noted: “Indifference \r\nis always the friend of the enemy, for it benefits the \r\naggressor.”\r\n10/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nI have described the contours of an international \r\nsystem radically different from the one established \r\nwhen the United Nations was born 70 years ago. \r\nCollectively and individually, we struggle to address \r\nmany of the problems that we now face. \r\nIn 2013, the General Assembly adopted the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty (resolution 68/31) to regulate international \r\ntrade in conventional weapons, with the expectation \r\nthat it will contribute to the prevention and eradication \r\nof the illicit trade in small arms and light weapons. \r\nThrough the determined efforts of the countries of \r\nthe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and other \r\nlike-minded States, small arms and light weapons and \r\ntheir ammunition, parts and components were included \r\nin the scope of the Treaty. Barbados was, therefore, \r\npleased to ratify the Arms Trade Treaty in May of this \r\nyear.\r\nIn July of this year, under the presidency of New \r\nZealand, the Security Council held its first-ever open \r\ndebate on the particular peace and security challenges \r\nfacing small island developing States (see S/PV.7499). \r\nAt that meeting, Barbados indicated that it has always \r\nopposed, and continues strongly to oppose, the \r\nproliferation and use of nuclear, biological and chemical \r\nweapons. However, for countries like Barbados, the \r\nreal weapons of mass destruction are small arms and \r\nlight weapons, and our focus is necessarily on the trade \r\nin those weapons, which often goes arm-in-arm with \r\nthe traffic in illicit drugs and other forms of organized \r\ncrime. Both have the capacity to seriously undermine \r\nour economies and destabilize our societies. Barbados \r\nwelcomes the initiative and persistence that made \r\npossible the adoption of the Arms Trade Treaty and \r\ncommits to playing its part in addressing global peace \r\nand security challenges.\r\nAlso in July of this year, we adopted the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda (resolution 69/313, annex), \r\nwhich provides a series of bold measures to overhaul \r\nglobal finance practices and generate investments for \r\ntackling a range of economic, social and environmental \r\nchallenges.\r\nFinally, last week we adopted the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which \r\nformulates a new development agenda based on the 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals. The link between the \r\n2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda is \r\nclear: the former sets out the Goals and the latter the \r\nmeans of their attainment. One without the other is \r\nbereft of meaning.\r\nI take this opportunity to connect those important \r\ninitiatives to a concern that the countries of the \r\nCaribbean Community and others have been expressing \r\nfor some time, most recently during our meeting of \r\nHeads of Government in July, which, this year, Barbados \r\nhad the honour to host. The United Nations and the \r\ninternational financial institutions must address the \r\nmatter of the graduation of middle-income countries, \r\nsuch as Barbados, from access to concessionary and \r\ngrant-based financing. Now, we contend, is the time \r\nto develop and utilize appropriate measurements for \r\ndevelopment that go beyond a simplistic reliance on a \r\ncountry’s gross domestic product per capita.\r\nIt was with especial pleasure that we received the \r\nnews earlier this year that, 43 years after Barbados \r\nand three other CARICOM member States —Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, Jamaica and Guyana — had ended their \r\ndiplomatic isolation of Cuba, the United States of \r\nAmerica has decided to do the same. For Barbados, \r\nthat must be seen as a positive development, as we have \r\nbeen calling consistently, insistently and persistently \r\nsince 1972 for an end to the economic embargo, \r\nwhich has not only retarded the development of Cuba \r\nbut has also cheated its people of the opportunity to \r\nfulfil their aspirations, as they should. My delegation \r\ncongratulates President Barack Obama of the United \r\nStates of America for the hindsight, the insight, and the \r\nforesight that informed his decision and looks forward \r\nto the process of Cuba’s total embrace through the \r\nremoval, in the near future, of the economic embargo.\r\nIn a similar vein, it is not without significance that 21 \r\nmonths before we adopted the 2030 Agenda, the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 68/237, which proclaimed \r\nthe International Decade for People of African \r\nDescent, under the theme, “People of African descent: \r\nrecognition, justice and development”, commencing \r\non 1 January 2015 and ending on 31 December 2024. \r\nThe Decade was launched by the Secretary-General \r\nin December 2014, with the keynote address delivered \r\nby Barbadian Professor Sir Hilary Beckles, then Pro-\r\nVice Chancellor of the University of the West Indies. \r\nMy delegation confidently expects that as we pursue \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, due regard will be \r\naccorded to the reparative justice contemplated not only \r\nby the theme of that very important Decade, but also by \r\nits specific mention in the programme of activities for \r\nthe implementation of the Decade.\r\nPermit me to reach back again into our \r\nOrganization’s history, for it continues to illuminate our \r\n15-29816 11/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\npresent and to set out the way forward for our future. \r\nWhen he took office as the first Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations, the Norwegian diplomat, Trygve \r\nLie, said at one of the earliest meetings of the General \r\nAssembly, on 2 February 1946: \r\n“The purpose of the United Nations is \r\nthe maintenance of peace in an atmosphere of \r\ninternational security and general well-being … \r\nBut there is a close connection between the peace \r\nproblem and the economic and social conditions of \r\nthe countries of the world.” (A/PV.22, p. 325)\r\nBarbados, a small island developing State, has been \r\nand remains a staunch supporter of the United Nations, \r\ncommitted to the principles of multilateralism and the \r\nsovereign equality of States and to the inextricable \r\nlink between peace and security, on the one hand, and \r\neconomic and social development, on the other. Today \r\nthose principles, we are proud to say, are nowhere better \r\nreflected than in the ideals to which States Members \r\nof the United Nations still subscribe in their collective \r\nmarch to promote, for the peoples of the world, social \r\nprogress and better standards of life in larger freedom.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for National Security, the \r\nPublic Service and Urban Development of Barbados for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Freundel Stuart, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nNational Security, the Public Service and Urban \r\nDevelopment of Barbados, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Michel Kafando, \r\nPresident of the Transition, President of Faso and \r\nMinister of National Defense, Veterans Affairs and \r\nMinister of Security of Burkina Faso\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Michel Kafando, President of the Transition, \r\nPresident of Faso and Minister of National Defense and \r\nVeterans Affairs and Minister of Security of Burkina \r\nFaso.\r\nMr. Michel Kafando, President of the Transition, \r\nPresident of Faso and Minister of National Defense \r\nand Veterans Affairs and Minister of Security \r\nof Burkina Faso, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Michel \r\nKafando, President of the Transition, President of Faso \r\nand Minister of National Defense and Veterans Affairs \r\nand Minister of Security of Burkina Faso, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kafando (spoke in French): It is my \r\nhonour to address the Assembly as President of the \r\nTransition of Burkina Faso. I wish to convey my warmest \r\nand most sincere appreciation to the General Assembly \r\nand to congratulate the President on his election to \r\npreside over the Assembly at its seventieth session. \r\nI should also like to pay tribute to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa, for his clear-sighted guidance of the \r\nwork of the sixty-ninth session.\r\nSince the transition that I am leading resulted \r\nfrom a popular uprising in October 2014, which said \r\n“no” to the arbitrariness, nepotism and injustice of an \r\nundemocratic regime, I have come here to promote \r\nliberty and democracy. Here, before the Assembly, I \r\nhave come to extol the virtue of liberty, true liberty, \r\nthe liberty that the French revolutionaries of 1789 \r\ndreamed about and an ideal that so many human beings \r\ntoday still aspire to. I want to call for liberty, plain \r\nand simple. As I was deprived of liberty for a time, I \r\nknow how precious it is. I have come here to pay tribute \r\nto democracy, which today has become a universal \r\ncanon — except in Burkina Faso, where praetorians \r\nof another age were trying to row against the tide of \r\nhistory and attempted to seize our democracy in order \r\nto serve their sordid ambitions.\r\nThanks to the international community, which is \r\nthe defender of those values  I just mentioned, I speak \r\nhere freely before Member States. That was unthinkable \r\nonly two weeks ago, when I was jailed during the \r\nmilitary uprising. On 16 September, my country, \r\nBurkina Faso, was the victim of a heinous coup d’état \r\nperpetrated by officers bought by vengeful politicians. \r\nMoreover, that happened just before the launch of \r\nour electoral campaign. The wishes of the people of \r\nBurkina Faso were not taken into account. The national \r\nand spontaneous response of the people was impressive. \r\nThey tried to block the path that those adventurers were \r\nattempting to take. Regrettably, that led to a tragic loss \r\nof life and many wounded. On that occasion, the people \r\nof Burkina Faso, and its youth in particular, showed an \r\nunprecedented level of patriotism.\r\n12/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nThe international community also promptly came \r\nforward to unanimously condemn the coup and support \r\nthe transition. From this rostrum, I wish to thank all \r\nthe countries, without exception, and the international \r\norganizations, civil society organizations and journalists \r\nfrom around world that came together so quickly to \r\nfrustrate the coup d’état, thereby enabling a return to \r\nnormalcy and legitimacy. The people of Burkina Faso \r\nhave asked me to speak to the Assembly, to the nations \r\nof peace, and to convey our deep appreciation to \r\nMember States. We ask them to continue to support our \r\nefforts to implant genuine democracy in Burkina Faso \r\nthrough the holding of free and transparent elections, \r\nwhich we will be organizing shortly.\r\nI have spoken at length about my country, but \r\nnow I wish to address some major concerns on the \r\ninternational scene.\r\nFirst, the global economic situation continues to \r\ndevelop unfavourably and thus makes demands of us, \r\nparticularly with regard to our common commitment to \r\neradicate poverty, especially in developing countries. \r\nIt is completely obvious that we are far from having \r\nsuccessfully risen to the challenge of fulfilling the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, although several \r\nMember States have made significant progress. We \r\nmust thus redouble our efforts and take robust action \r\nin order to improve the living conditions of our \r\npopulations. “A new commitment to action” — the \r\ntheme we have chosen for our session calls on us to act \r\nquickly to attain tangible results through programmes \r\nthat are  ambitious and, above all, pragmatic.\r\nWe should note, in that context, that the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda adopted at the third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development lays the \r\ngroundwork for the effective implementation of the \r\npost-2015 development agenda that we have recently \r\nadopted (see resolution 70/1). We welcome the holding of \r\nthat Conference, and we hope that the consensus forged \r\naround a new generation of Sustainable Development \r\nGoals will bring about social and economic well-being \r\nfor our populations.\r\nClimate change, a key parameter of development, \r\nmerits particular attention. That is why the tthe \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin Paris in December, is so important. The environment \r\npact that should result from that event should enable \r\nus to strengthen the protection of our planet against \r\nclimate disasters and environmental agression arising \r\nfrom the abuses of a consumer society.\r\nIn 70 years of its existence, the United Nations \r\nhas unflaggingly endeavoured to work for a world of \r\npeace, a world that is safe. Burkina Faso reaffirms \r\nits determination to resolutely support peacekeeping \r\nefforts around the world. We are already actively \r\nparticipating in peacekeeping operations, in our sister \r\nRepublic of Mali, for example, where the mission \r\nis twofold: to ensure security in the country and to \r\ncombat terrorism. We contribute to the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts to combat terrorism and violent \r\nextremism, as the eradication of those phenomena \r\nrequires a global coalition.\r\nOn the issue of disarmament, we must continue \r\nour efforts to strengthen confidence among our States. \r\nSuch confidence facilitated the conclusion of the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action of 14 July 2015 on the \r\nIran nuclear issue, which reassured the international \r\ncommunity with regard to its legitimate fears \r\nconcerning nuclear proliferation.\r\nWe encourage the States Members of the United \r\nNations likewise to move towards a peaceful resolution \r\nof the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\r\nWith regard to Western Sahara, my country, which \r\nhas always encouraged a negotiated political solution, \r\nreaffirms its endorsement the initiative of the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco promoting a status of autonomy for the \r\nSahara region, as a credible and realistic alternative in \r\nthe conclusion of that dispute. \r\nWith regard to the American sanctions imposed on \r\nCuba, Burkina Faso favours its total lifting. We also \r\nwelcome the recent positive developments between \r\nCuba and the United States of America, which augure \r\nwell for a definitive normalization of bilateral relations \r\nbetween the two countries.\r\nA full Member of our Organization, Burkina \r\nFaso endorses the reforms aimed at streamlining the \r\nfunctioning of the United Nations. On Security Council \r\nreform, we reiterate our full support for the African \r\nposition, which is based on the Ezulwini Consensus \r\nand the Sirte Declaration.\r\nAlways respectful of the ideals of the United \r\nNations, which are based on the principles of peaceful \r\ncoexistence, dialogue and the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes, we welcome and encourage a rapprochement \r\n15-29816 13/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nbetween the People’s Republic of China and the \r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan.\r\nBefore concluding, I wish to convey my appreciation \r\nfor the international solidarity shown in eradicating the \r\nEbola virus. We must not relax our vigilance. We must \r\nintensify international cooperation to maintain those \r\nresults and ensure that the countries severely affected \r\nby that disease can recover. The virtues of international \r\nsolidarity and dialogue among nations must continue to \r\ninspire the United Nations so that together we can meet \r\nthe challenges of our time.\r\nIn the tremendous task before us of building an \r\ninternational society that is more democratic and \r\nhumane, Burkina Faso can always be found in the front \r\nranks. Burkina Faso wishes to reiterate its good will \r\nand deeply thank the Assembly, yet again.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Transition, President of Faso and Minister of \r\nNational Defense, Veteran Affairs and Security of \r\nBurkina Faso for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Michel Kafando, President of the Transition, \r\nPresident of Faso and Minister of National Defense \r\nand Veteran Affairs and Minister of Security of \r\nBurkina Faso, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Sir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister of Defence and Home \r\nAffairs, Minister of Rodrigues and National \r\nDevelopment Unit of the Republic of Mauritius\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister, Minister of Defence and Home Affairs, \r\nMinister of Rodrigues and National Development Unit \r\nof the Republic of Mauritius.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nDefence and Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues \r\nand National Development Unit of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Sir Anerood \r\nJugnauth, Prime Minister, Minister of Defence and \r\nHome Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues and National \r\nDevelopment Unit of the Republic of Mauritius, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth (Mauritius): Twelve \r\nyears ago, I bade farewell to the Assembly, as I had \r\ndecided to retire from active politics thereafter, which \r\nI did. However, destiny and the wish of the people of \r\nMauritius brought me back into the political arena, and \r\nI stand here anew as Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, following my electoral victory in December \r\n2014 through free and fair elections.\r\nThis is yet another affirmation of the fact that \r\nMauritius upholds a high tradition of democracy, \r\nrespect for human rights, the rule of law and peaceful \r\ncoexistence. We will solemnly continue to uphold those \r\nuniversal values, which require our careful nurturing \r\nas States Members of the United Nations. For indeed, \r\nthere can be no better tribute to the United Nations, as \r\nwe celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Charter, \r\nthan to see nations working together to sustain those \r\nvalues and to promote the establishment of peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nIn that context, we commend the Secretary-General \r\nfor the timely setting up of the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations to review the United Nations \r\npeace architecture. We are particularly supportive of the \r\nrecommendation for stronger and deeper partnerships \r\namong global and regional organizations aimed at \r\npromoting international peace and security. For we in \r\nMauritius have witnessed how the collective efforts of \r\nthe United Nations, the African Union, the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community, the Indian Ocean \r\nCommission and other regional economic communities \r\nunlocked the political stalemate in Madagascar, \r\nenabling our neighbour and brother nation to pursue \r\nits path to development. Similar collaboration has also \r\nenabled the African Union to deploy robust operations \r\nin complex situations in Mali, the Central African \r\nRepublic and Somalia.\r\nMauritius strongly condemns the recent coup in \r\nBurkina Faso and appreciates the current initiatives of \r\nthe United Nations, the African Union and Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States to keep that country \r\non the path of democracy. Mauritius is fully committed \r\nto the implementation of Agenda 2063 of the African \r\nUnion, which represents the collective vision of \r\nAfricans for a peaceful, united and prosperous Africa.\r\nWe congratulate the Palestinian Authority on \r\nthe occasion of the formal recognition by the United \r\n14/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nNations of Palestine as an Observer. Mauritius calls \r\non the international community to put in even greater \r\nefforts to ensure that the two independent, secure and \r\nviable States of Palestine and Israel live peacefully \r\nside by side. Similarly, we wish to see an end to the \r\nphenomenon of refugees f leeing one tragedy only to \r\nface an even greater disaster.\r\nThe spread of armaments, nuclear proliferation, \r\nterrorism and piracy remain important threats to \r\nworld peace and require our constant vigilance. My \r\ncountry will therefore pursue its fight against piracy \r\nas a member of the Contact Group on Somali Piracy \r\nand welcomes the decision to review the boundaries \r\nof the High Risk Area, so as to reduce inflationary \r\npressures on maritime and freight costs. We welcome \r\nthe agreement reached on the Iranian nuclear issue and \r\ncall for the implementation of the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action, as it can contribute to international \r\npeace and security.\r\nLet me share with the Assembly the fact that \r\nMauritius acceded to the Arms Trade Treaty in July, \r\nand yesterday I deposited our instrument of accession \r\nto the Convention on Cluster Munitions. As we deal \r\nwith the issue of armaments, we must remain conscious \r\nof the fact that the biggest weapon of all remains \r\nfear — the fear that terrorists use so extensively to \r\ncurtail freedom of thought, freedom of expression and \r\nimpose their intolerance upon those who dare to be \r\ndifferent. Mauritius unreservedly condemns terrorism, \r\nin all its forms and remains committed to combating \r\nintolerance and extremism, whether at the domestic \r\nlevel or internationally.\r\nAs we focus on peace and security, let us continue to \r\nlet ourselves be inspired by the life and deeds of Mahatma \r\nGandhi, whose birth date we are commemorating \r\ntoday. We have another golden opportunity here to pay \r\ntribute to the Mahatma, the apostle of nonviolence, the \r\nman who shunned intolerance and who asked us to live \r\nsimply so that others may simply live.\r\nAs a small island developing State (SIDS) that is \r\nvulnerable to natural hazards, Mauritius believes that \r\nthe greatest challenge to peace and security in the \r\nyears to come will be climate change, which requires \r\nour utmost attention now. If we do not act collectively \r\nand in a spirit of solidarity, if we are unable to reach a \r\nbinding climate agreement at the coming United Nations \r\nClimate Change Conference that would limit the world \r\ntemperature increase to less than 1.5°C compared to \r\n1990, we will be failing in our duty towards Mother \r\nEarth and future generations.\r\nLet there be a space carved out for small island \r\ndeveloping States, the most vulnerable of all, for the \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs) and for Africa \r\nto enable them to implement fully the necessary \r\nmitigation and adaptation measures. Let financing be \r\navailable and predictable, in addition to the sharing \r\nof technology to address a collective threat. In this \r\nrespect, Mauritius is pleased to host the Commonwealth \r\nClimate Finance Skills Hub, which will be launched at \r\nthe forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government \r\nMeeting in Malta. This mechanism aims to assist SIDS \r\nand LDCs access much-needed funds for adaptation \r\nand mitigation.\r\nMauritius particularly welcomes Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 5, relating to women’s and girls’ \r\nempowerment. Mauritius has made steady progress on \r\nthis agenda and continues to put in place appropriate \r\nstrategies to further promote gender equality in all \r\nspheres of development. I am proud to announce that \r\nfor the first time in history, my country has three \r\nwomen in high positions: President of the Republic, \r\nVice-President, and Speaker of the National Assembly \r\nof Mauritius.\r\nThere can be no democracy without human rights \r\nand no human rights without development. A balance \r\nneeds to be maintained in the trident of peace, human \r\nrights and development. \r\nWe are living at a time of uncertainty when not a \r\nsingle nation is immune from external shocks, but some \r\nare more exposed than others.\r\nAs a small developing State, my country is highly \r\nvulnerable to external shocks and a high current account \r\ndeficit. We depend on foreign markets for tourism, \r\ntrade and investments, and we have limited fiscal space \r\nto manoeuvre. In addition, our ageing population not \r\nonly leads to a reduction of our productive capacity, but \r\nalso costs significant resources in terms of health care \r\nfinancing and retirement benefits. However, against this \r\nbleak backdrop, my Government is making sure that the \r\nwelfare State, of which we are so proud, is maintained. \r\nWe are re-engineering our economy. We have pledged \r\nto achieve an average gross domestic product (GDP) \r\ngrowth of 5.5 per cent annually as from 2017 on the \r\nback of a technology- and innovation-driven economy \r\nfocusing on sustainability and human development.\r\n15-29816 15/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nMore than ever, Mauritius needs the support of \r\nthe international community to untangle itself from \r\nthe middle-income web and reach the high-income \r\ncountry status. Financial institutions and development \r\npartners need to look beyond our relatively high GDP, \r\nwhich obscures the real cost that we have to pay for \r\nour development and precludes us from accessing \r\nvital development finance and support. Development \r\npartners should not forget that the specific and \r\nunique vulnerabilities of SIDS have been reiterated, \r\nhighlighted and acknowledged by world leaders in \r\nthe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) \r\nPathway and now in the post-2015 agenda.\r\nIt is gratifying to note that the Addis Ababa \r\nInternational Conference on Financing for Development \r\nhas pledged to support the economic transformation of \r\nSIDS and LDCs through domestic resource mobilization, \r\ncatalytic use of official development assistance and \r\nstrong trade commitments. These promises should be \r\neffectively translated into reality to drive forward our \r\nsustainable development agenda.\r\nMauritius is committed to upholding good \r\ngovernance, transparency and the rule of law at \r\nall levels. We have been very active in ensuring \r\neffective implementation of international standards of \r\ntransparency and exchange of information, with a view \r\nto combating tax evasion, money laundering and other \r\nmalpractices. Mauritius was one of the earliest States \r\nto sign a Multilateral Competent Authority Agreement \r\nwith the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment (OECD), to automatically exchange \r\ninformation on financial matters, and in June we \r\nreaffirmed our commitment by officially signing \r\nthe OECD’s multilateral Convention on Mutual \r\nAdministrative Assistance in Tax Matters.\r\nIn March this year, Mauritius was privileged to \r\nhost the signature ceremony for the United Nations \r\nConvention on Transparency in Treaty-based Investor-\r\nState Arbitration (resolution 69/116, annex), otherwise \r\nknown as the Mauritius Convention on Transparency. \r\nBy being the first country to sign and ratify the \r\nConvention, we are forcefully demonstrating our \r\ncommitment to democratic participation, transparency \r\nand good governance.\r\nThe rule of law should be promoted not only at the \r\nnational, but also at the international, level. We need to \r\npursue meaningful efforts to reform the United Nations \r\nto make it more responsive to the needs and aspirations \r\nof all the Member States. If our Organization is to \r\nremain legitimate, there should be a comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council. The status quo is \r\nnot an option. The legitimate aspiration of Africa for \r\npermanent representation in the Council should not \r\nbe denied. Mauritius reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nAfrican Common Position, enshrined in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration. Small island \r\ndeveloping States, which represent over a quarter of \r\nUnited Nations membership, deserve representation \r\non the Council. Likewise, Mauritius supports India’s \r\nrightful aspiration to a permanent seat in a reformed \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMauritius has always firmly supported the \r\nresolution of disputes by peaceful means, as inscribed \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that, \r\nin accordance with resolutions of the Assembly, it is \r\nhigh time to complete the process of decolonization in \r\nAfrica.\r\nIt is also high time to resolve the situation that \r\nprevents Mauritius from effectively exercising its \r\nsovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago and the island \r\nof Tromelin, which form an integral part of the territory \r\nof Mauritius. The Chagos Archipelago was illegally \r\nexcised by the United Kingdom from the territory \r\nof Mauritius prior to its accession to independence, \r\nin breach of international law and resolutions of the \r\nAssembly. In the wake of that illegal excision, the \r\nMauritians who were residing at the time in the Chagos \r\nArchipelago were forcibly evicted by the British \r\nauthorities, in total disregard of their human rights. Most \r\nof them were moved to the main island of Mauritius. \r\nThe Government of Mauritius is fully sensitive to their \r\nplight and to their legitimate aspiration, as Mauritian \r\ncitizens, to resettle in the Archipelago.\r\nMauritius welcomes the Award of the Arbitral \r\nTribunal delivered on 18 March against the United \r\nKingdom, under the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea. We welcome the Tribunal’s decision \r\nthat the Marine Protected Area purportedly declared \r\nby the United Kingdom around the Chagos Archipelago \r\nwas established in violation of international law. We \r\nalso welcome the Tribunal’s unanimous recognition \r\nthat Mauritius has an interest in significant decisions \r\nbearing upon the uses of the Archipelago pending its \r\nreturn to the effective control of Mauritius.\r\nThis arbitral proceeding was the first occasion \r\non which any international judge or arbitrator has \r\nconsidered the facts and history lying behind Mauritius’ \r\nentitlement to sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago. \r\n16/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nMauritius appreciates the fact that two arbitrators have \r\nconfirmed the opinion that the United Kingdom is not \r\nthe coastal State in relation to the Chagos Archipelago. \r\nThat view has not been contradicted by any other judge \r\nor arbitrator. It unquestionably confirms our stand that \r\nthe Chagos Archipelago is and always has been an \r\nintegral part of the territory of Mauritius.\r\nThe Tribunal underscores the United Kingdom’s \r\nlegally binding obligations to Mauritius. It establishes \r\nbeyond doubt that under international law Mauritius \r\nhas real, firm and binding rights over the Chagos \r\nArchipelago and that the United Kingdom must respect \r\nthose rights. The Tribunal recognized that Mauritius \r\nhas a legal interest in the Chagos Archipelago such \r\nthat decisions affecting its future use cannot be taken \r\nwithout the involvement of Mauritius.\r\nDespite the Tribunal’s clear ruling, we regret \r\nthat the United Kingdom appears to be adopting a \r\ndifferent approach to Mauritius’s rights. It recently \r\nlaunched a so-called consultation exercise on the \r\npotential resettlement of Mauritians of Chagossian \r\norigin in the Chagos Archipelago under conditions \r\nthat again amount to a gross violation of their most \r\nbasic human rights. Mauritius rejects this purported \r\nconsultation exercise unreservedly. We wish to assure \r\nthe international community that once Mauritius is able \r\nto effectively exercise its sovereignty over the Chagos \r\nArchipelago, our brothers and sisters of Chagossian \r\norigin who resettle there will be able to live in dignity \r\nand enjoy their basic human rights, as they currently do \r\nin Mauritius.\r\nConsidering the Tribunal’s decision, we urge the \r\nUnited States of America, which is currently using \r\nDiego Garcia for defence purposes, to engage in \r\ndiscussions with Mauritius regarding the long-term \r\ninterests of Mauritius where the Chagos Archipelago \r\nis concerned, particularly in view of the affirmation \r\nby the President of the United States when he said so \r\nearnestly in his address to the Assembly on Monday \r\nthat “we cannot stand by when the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of a nation is f lagrantly violated” \r\n(A/70/PV.13, p. 12).\r\nThe Government of Mauritius is resolutely \r\ncommitted to making every effort that accords \r\nwith international law to enable it to effectively \r\nexercise its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago, \r\nincluding the possibility of having further recourse \r\nto judicial or arbitral bodies. We urge the Assembly \r\nand the international community in general to support \r\nMauritius in its legitimate endeavours. The Assembly \r\nhas a direct institutional interest in the resolution of the \r\nmatter.\r\nThe Assembly has of course historically played a \r\ncentral role in addressing decolonization through the \r\nexercise of its powers and functions, especially in \r\nrelation to Chapters XI through XIII of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. In its resolution 1514 (XV), of \r\n14 December 1960, on the granting of independence to \r\ncolonial countries and peoples, the Assembly declared \r\nthat any attempt to disrupt the territorial integrity of \r\nsuch a country was incompatible with the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter. In resolution 2066 (XX), \r\nof 16 December 1965, which dealt specifically with \r\nMauritius, the Assembly drew attention to the duty of \r\nthe administering Power not to dismember the territory \r\nor violate the territorial integrity of the then colony. \r\nThe Assembly therefore has a responsibility to help \r\nto complete the historic process of decolonization that it \r\nso successfully instigated and oversaw in the second half \r\nof the twentieth century. That is why we are convinced \r\nthat the Assembly should now establish a mechanism \r\nto enable and monitor the full implementation of its \r\nrelevant resolutions.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express \r\nMauritius’s deep appreciation for the unflinching \r\nsupport it has consistently received from members of the \r\nAfrican Union, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group \r\nof 77 and China, and other friendly countries on the \r\nissue of its sovereignty over the Chagos Archipelago.\r\nAs regards Tromelin, we urge France to pursue a \r\ndialogue with Mauritius in order to quickly resolve the \r\ndispute over that island in the spirit of friendship that \r\nhas always characterized the relationship between our \r\ntwo countries.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe know we can count on France’s nobility and its \r\nideals of justice and fraternity to ensure that Mauritius \r\ncan exercise effective sovereignty over Tromelin.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI will conclude by saying that for peace, security \r\nand inclusive and sustainable development to prevail \r\nin our countries, we must act from our hearts. Only \r\nthen will we succeed in building the world we all \r\ndream of. We should take inspiration from the wisdom-\r\npacked message of Pope Francis, who blessed us with \r\n15-29816 17/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nhis presence in the Assembly last week. As he said so \r\nmagnanimously:\r\n“It must never be forgotten that political and \r\neconomic activity is only effective when it is \r\nunderstood as a prudential activity, guided by \r\na perennial concept of justice and constantly \r\nconscious of the fact that, above and beyond our \r\nplans and programmes, we are dealing with real \r\nmen and women, just like the Government leaders, \r\nwho live, struggle and suffer, and are often forced \r\nto live in great poverty, deprived of all rights.” \r\n(A/70/PV.3, p. 4)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister, Minister of Defence and Home Affairs, \r\nMinister of Rodrigues and National Development Unit \r\nof the Republic of Mauritius for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nDefence and Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues \r\nand National Development Unit of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Timothy S. Harris, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, National Security, People \r\nEmpowerment and Constituency Empowerment \r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Sustainable Development, \r\nNational Security, People Empowerment and \r\nConstituency Empowerment of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Timothy S. Harris, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nSustainable Development, National Security, People \r\nEmpowerment and Constituency Empowerment of \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Timothy S. Harris, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nSustainable Development, National Security, People \r\nEmpowerment and Constituency Empowerment of \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, and inviting him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Harris (Saint Kitts and Nevis): It is indeed \r\nan honour for me to address this organ of the United \r\nNations in my capacity as Prime Minister of Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis, a privilege of service bestowed on \r\nme following our people’s historic victory at the polls \r\nin February of this year. I take pleasure in sharing the \r\nperspectives of the Government and people of Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis on matters that are before the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session.\r\nMy delegation is pleased that the focus of the general \r\ndebate, “The United Nations at 70: a new commitment \r\nto action”, will shed special light on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which form the basis of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). \r\nWe are in full agreement with the Assembly that the \r\nnew partnerships for sustainable development will be \r\nat the centre of the work of the United Nations until \r\nthe year 2030. We are optimistic that the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, when taken in conjunction with \r\nthe recently adopted Addis Ababa Action Agenda and \r\na forward-looking and responsible outcome at the Paris \r\nClimate Change Conference in December, represents a \r\ncourageous step forward for humankind that, if fully \r\nimplemented, will yield the kind of future that our \r\nchildren and grandchildren deserve.\r\nSo onward with action — the action that is required \r\nto create decent jobs for our people, build schools for \r\nour children, deliver quality health care for all and \r\nprovide affordable homes to our working mothers and \r\nfathers. Be assured that Saint Kitts and Nevis stands \r\ncommitted to the process of implementation, which of \r\ncourse must include a robust, systematic and effective \r\nmonitoring and review process.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nClimate change is of utmost importance for us. It \r\nmust never be placed on the proverbial back burner. I dare \r\nsubmit that for small island developing States (SIDS), \r\nlike Saint Kitts and Nevis, it remains an existential \r\nthreat. Our economic, social and environmental well-\r\nbeing is threatened by natural disasters, including \r\ndevastating f loods and persistent droughts, by sea-level \r\nrise, coastal erosion and ocean acidification. Those acts \r\nof nature have the capacity to undermine our economic \r\ngrowth, threaten food security and bring hardships on \r\nour people. The challenge to our vital tourism industry \r\nis unsettling, and the loss of entire coastal communities \r\nis devastating to our islands. The current situation in \r\nDominica represents what islands face when dealing \r\nwith climate change. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to do more to help small island developing \r\nStates adapt and adjust. We would like consideration \r\n18/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nto be given not just to climate change adaptation and \r\nmitigation, but also to disaster response, recovery and \r\ninsurance.\r\nWhen we speak of adaptation to climate change \r\nand the wider issue of disaster-risk mitigation, it is \r\nincumbent on us to underscore the significant financial \r\nburden that is placed on national budgets by projects \r\ndesigned to build resilience and increase our chances of \r\nsurvival in the face of climate events. Access to global \r\nfunding mechanisms such as the Green Climate Fund \r\nis of critical importance to us. For too long we have \r\nbeen hamstrung by complex application procedures \r\nthat have prevented us from accessing the vital funds \r\nneeded to enable us to achieve sustainable development. \r\nWe appreciate the recent decision by the Green \r\nClimate Fund Board to aim for a f loor of 50 per cent \r\nof the adaptation allocation for particularly vulnerable \r\ncountries. We also appreciate the importance placed on \r\nfilling capacity gaps in assessing and managing climate \r\nfinance. Access to finance, if it is to be meaningful, \r\nmust be simplified and it must be timely.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the establishment of the \r\nSIDS DOCK facility for sustainable energy, which \r\nwill serve as a clearing house for the implementation \r\nof climate-related projects in small island developing \r\nStates. We acknowledge the assistance provided by \r\nour partners in development. We are convinced that \r\nworking closely with our partners to build effective and \r\nmeaningful partnerships will accelerate the pathway to \r\nachieving sustainable development in all its dimensions.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis has emerged as a leader in \r\nrenewable energy development in the Caribbean. Even \r\nnow, our country has a mix of wind and solar power in \r\nour energy grid. By 2016, we shall add a waste-to-energy \r\nprogramme and by 2018 we shall add geothermal energy \r\non the island of Nevis. We are working assiduously to \r\nreduce our dependence on fossil fuels and so reduce our \r\ncarbon footprint. In that ambitious agenda, I thank all \r\nour international partners who have lent their technical \r\nassistance and expertise in advancing the renewable \r\nenergy trust in my country.\r\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis is \r\nfully committed to social equity, justice, people’s \r\nempowerment, good governance, transparency and, of \r\ncourse, prosperity for all. We are a people’s Government, \r\nborn out of the desire to put the development of our \r\npeople first. We therefore are hoping to build broader \r\nconstituencies of support on several fronts to address \r\nthe problem of crime. \r\nAt home, we instituted a six-point plan in our fight \r\nto reduce violent crime, in particular. We are investing \r\nin new equipment and training to support our law \r\nenforcement professionals in the prevention, detection \r\nand solving of crimes. We are working hard to build \r\na new professional culture among and between our \r\nlaw enforcement agencies. We are encouraged by new \r\nstatistics pointing to a decline in major crimes in the \r\nFederation of Saint Kitts and Nevis, while accepting \r\nat the same time that much more still needs to be done.\r\nOur Government is determined to aggressively \r\nconfront the issues of crime. We will work on multiple \r\ntracks, including working to empower families and \r\ncommunities through education, skills development \r\ninitiatives and civic programmes. We will work in \r\nschools, with non-governmental organizations, with \r\nour religious leaders and with the youths themselves, \r\nespecially those most likely to become targets or \r\nperpetrators of criminal behaviour. We will offer them \r\nalternatives and opportunities for personal growth, \r\ndecent work and constructive engagement in our \r\nsociety. It is a challenge to which we are committed and \r\nwhich we have to win.\r\nHowever, if small States are to overcome the \r\nchallenges posed and exacerbated by transnational \r\ncriminal activities, we must work in partnership. \r\nWe need the support of gun-producing countries to \r\nrestrict the movement of illegal guns, light weapons \r\nand ammunition. Those who produce firearms must do \r\nmore to stop them from reaching our shores. We must \r\nshare information and improve access to opportunities, \r\neducation and employment, because sustainable \r\ndevelopment is not achievable in an environment of \r\ncrime and violence. Prosperity must be built brick by \r\nbrick, day by day, and is realizable solely in the context \r\nof peaceful and safe societies.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, like the rest of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM), has consistently lent its \r\nvoice to the clarion call for greater attention to the \r\nharmful impact of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) \r\non our main resource: our human capital. We continue \r\nto wrestle with the high incidence of diseases like \r\ncancer, heart disease, diabetes and hypertension in our \r\ncountry and, indeed, throughout the CARICOM region. \r\nWe wish to reiterate our call for a stronger global \r\nresponse in combating NCDs in developing countries \r\nlike ours. We remain hopeful that the inclusion of \r\nNCDs in the Sustainable Development Goals and the \r\nimplementation of the targets and indicators at the \r\n15-29816 19/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nnational level will reverse the high incidence of NCDs \r\nat the national, regional and global levels. The famous \r\nadage “A nation’s health is a nation’s wealth” resonates \r\nwell with us. We therefore urge the United Nations \r\nsystem to play a leading role in that regard through its \r\nspecialized agencies and regional offices.\r\nWe are pleased with the work of the Joint United \r\nNations Programme on HIV/AIDS and our Pan Caribbean \r\nPartnership against HIV/AIDS in CARICOM, and we \r\ncall for continued global solidarity in that endeavour. \r\nMy own country is on track to achieve zero mother-\r\nto-child transmission by the end of 2015, and we are \r\ncommitted to the aim of making CARICOM the first \r\nregion in the world to end AIDS by 2030.\r\nMy Government is pleased to draw the international \r\ncommunity’s attention to the invaluable contribution \r\nby the Government of the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan in the areas of international cooperation, \r\nhealth, technology and peace and security. We live in \r\nan age when global partnership is a prerequisite for \r\nsolving complex problems at the international level. \r\nThe Government of Saint Kitts and Nevis is proud to \r\nannounce that a relationship established more than \r\nthree decades ago has yielded benefits in every area of \r\nsustainable development. Such a level of engagement \r\nbetween a developing country and its partner in \r\ndevelopment is indeed a model fit for consideration \r\nby small States such as ours in their quest to achieve \r\nsustainable development.\r\nAs we looked for models and arrangements that \r\nwould advance our global agenda, we found pragmatic, \r\nbeneficial value in our PetroCaribe agreement with \r\nVenezuela in support of poverty alleviation and social \r\ncohesion. Venezuela, under President Chávez and \r\nnow under President Maduro, must be commended \r\nfor showing the world that there can be a better and \r\nmore helpful way to drive the development agenda. \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is of course cognizant of the \r\nterritorial issues that exist between Venezuela and our \r\nfellow CARICOM member State of Guyana. We expect \r\nthe leaders of Venezuela and Guyana to resolve their \r\nissues peacefully and in accordance with international \r\nlaw. My Government stands willing to assist alongside \r\nCARICOM in resolving those very challenging issues.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis is indeed pleased by the recent \r\ndecision of the Governments of Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America to re-establish diplomatic relations, \r\na solution that CARICOM has long advocated. It is an \r\nopportune time for us to usher in a new era of regional \r\npartnership and cooperation. My own country has \r\nbenefited substantially from capacity-building in the \r\nareas of education and health thanks to our partnership \r\nwith Cuba. We applaud several prescriptions outlined \r\nin the address of President Castro to the Assembly \r\n(see A/70/PV.14) that call for better arrangements for \r\nCaribbean countries and for special and differential \r\ntreatment. \r\nWe concur that the issue of reparation must be \r\nseen in the broader context of the evil of slavery and \r\nits lingering negative impact on the development of the \r\nCaribbean. Reparation has to be considered a pathway \r\nto addressing the continuing disadvantages that slavery \r\nhas inflicted on our economies and societies.\r\nAs part of our development agenda, Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis will work daily to ensure that every citizen has \r\naccess to high-quality health care, a twenty-first-century \r\neducation, decent work and an improved quality of life \r\nconsistent with the Sustainable Development Goals of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. We remain eager to work within the \r\nUnited Nations system, but the United Nations must \r\nbe re-energized, retooled and refocused to meet the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. In fact, we want \r\nto see a United Nations strengthened and reflective of \r\nthe reality of our world, the needs of its membership \r\nand the wishes of our diverse and swelling populations.\r\nIn Saint Kitts and Nevis, we are building a modern, \r\nresponsible and responsive society, rooted in democracy \r\nand the rule of law. We are optimistic that in the months \r\nand years ahead, the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies will be more robust, nimble, modern and \r\nresponsive in order to complement our work and be \r\nbetter able to prevent crises in ways that effectively \r\nimprove lives. Through such commitments and actions \r\nwe will transform our beloved Saint Kitts and Nevis, \r\nthe United Nations and indeed the world. God bless the \r\ncountry and people of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Sustainable Development, \r\nNational Security, People Empowerment and \r\nConstituency Empowerment of Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Timothy S. Harris, Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Sustainable Development, National Security, \r\nPeople Empowerment and Constituency \r\nEmpowerment of Saint Kitts and Nevis, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\n20/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nAddress by Mr. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Albania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Albania.\r\nMr. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Edi \r\nRama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Rama (Albania): One year ago, Pope Francis \r\nbegan his visits around Europe in Albania. Last week, \r\nwe saw here in America the hope and joy he could \r\nbring to the richest and most powerful country in the \r\nworld. Imagine the joy he brought to us, not least by \r\nthe praise he bestowed on Albania in saying that we \r\nwere proof that a peaceful and fruitful coexistence \r\nbetween persons and communities of believers of \r\ndifferent religions is not only desirable, but possible \r\nand realistic. We are rightly proud of that heritage; of \r\ncoexisting as fraternal communities at a time when \r\nreligious extremism, violence and terrorism are causing \r\nunspeakable suffering — violence and extremism that \r\nhave put multitudes of people on the move in scenes \r\nreminiscent of the exodus of biblical times, with \r\nchildren, women and men arriving in their thousands \r\non our doorsteps in the Balkans as they seek safety and \r\nprotection in Europe.\r\nAs everyone here probably knows, ethnically \r\nmotivated conflicts and violence are by no means \r\nunknown to us in the Balkans. Today, however, we as \r\na region can finally dare to look ahead with hope and \r\nshow that another way forward is possible. \r\nLast year, for the first time after 100 years of frozen \r\nor live conflicts and confrontation in the Balkans, \r\nno guns were pointed at anyone’s window. After a \r\ncentury scarred by conflict, we have finally seen a \r\nyear of cooperation aimed at making the peace we have \r\nachieved a peace worth living. \r\nThe talks between Serbia and Kosovo, a new State \r\ncontributing to stability in the region, have enabled the \r\ntwo countries to find common solutions to a series of \r\nissues, for the good of their peoples. And here I would \r\nlike to call on all those in this Hall that have not yet \r\nrecognized Kosovo to do so, and by so doing to make a \r\nstraightforward contribution to strengthening stability, \r\npeace and cooperation in a region that last year became \r\na significant success story, a region in which hopes and \r\ndreams for the future are prevailing over the fears and \r\nnightmares of the past. Full recognition of Kosovo by \r\nevery nation in this Assembly will be good for Serbia \r\nas well.\r\nMoreover, last year I made the first visit of an \r\nAlbanian Prime Minister to Belgrade in 68 years. And \r\nsince the Western Balkans Summit, held in Vienna in \r\nAugust, our region has been successfully collaborating \r\nin a number of areas, including youth exchanges \r\npromoted by Albania and Serbia and inspired by the \r\nmodel of youth exchanges between France and Germany \r\nafter the Second World War. We are focusing on this in \r\nparticular because it is crucial for our young people to \r\nbe aware of what history has taught us: that it is better \r\nto celebrate our differences than to fight over them and \r\nto learn from our past than to live in it, no matter the \r\nplace, no matter the language, no matter the colour and \r\nno matter the religion.\r\nIn an unprecedented approach, the United \r\nNations has engaged in conversation with hundreds \r\nand thousands of young people. In developing the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, it has taken into \r\naccount their hopes and expectations. As we affirm \r\nour pledge to achieve these Goals, let us focus our \r\nattention on the young. Let us — countries large \r\nand small — come together to begin the process of \r\ndeveloping a global charter that puts the education of \r\nour young and our determination to give them a better \r\nfuture at its heart. We are going to introduce a reform in \r\nAlbania that will include in the school curriculum such \r\na charter of values. We have also been working hard \r\nto make progress on important reforms in a number \r\nof areas, including education, public administration, \r\nenergy, economic development, justice and the fight \r\nagainst crime.\r\nAlbania is eager to be part of the global team that \r\nwill meet this December in Paris to decide on measures \r\nto protect the environment in line with the objectives of \r\nsustainable development and the purposes to be served \r\nby the intended nationally determined contributions. \r\nThis unprecedented event will be effective if we act as \r\na great team and all play their parts. Yet, in an era beset \r\nby enormous challenges like climate change, violent \r\nextremism, poverty, inequality, corruption and illicit \r\ntrafficking, first and foremost let us ensure the future by \r\nteaching young people the values of tolerance, respect \r\n15-29816 21/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nand understanding no matter the place, the language, \r\nthe colour or the religion.\r\nI was an artist before being elected to political \r\noffice. Every day I still like to pick up a pencil or a \r\npen or a paintbrush, even for a few minutes, and draw, \r\ndoodle or paint. All of us are trying to paint our own big \r\npicture in our different ways, to set out a clear vision \r\nand to work towards it.\r\nIf the world were a painting, today it would \r\nprobably be more grey than black or white. There are \r\nfew certainties. And many splashes of glaring and harsh \r\ncolours would warn us of the many dangers and threats \r\nwe face. But here in this place, there are values and \r\nprinciples that we can apply to all the challenges in the \r\nworld, and we need them now more than ever. At a time \r\nof tragic events, with the sounds of war around him, \r\nWinston Churchill noted: “Words are the only things \r\nthat last forever.” Let us all depict in words in our school \r\ncurricula these values and principles of tolerance and \r\nrespect for the diversity of faiths, identities, cultures, \r\nhistories and beliefs, thereby recognizing the common \r\nhumanity that we all share.\r\nObviously, global principles and values of tolerance, \r\nwritten in black on the white paper of a global charter, \r\ncannot wipe out violent extremism, hatred, stereotypes, \r\ndiscrimination and the scars they have caused. Yet \r\nthese values, when they are put into words and taught in \r\nour schools, can bridge differences and inspire hearts \r\nand minds to take common action and usher in a better \r\nfuture for our world. The hearts and minds of our young \r\npeople represent the best insurance for a better future. \r\nIf we show them the right path, they will take it.\r\nLet us also try to be a better team and demonstrate, \r\nfirst and foremost, that we — men and women, \r\nindividuals and peoples — are joined together by our \r\ncommon humanity and must work together to build a \r\ncommon and sustainable future for all, no matter the \r\nplace, no matter the language, no matter the colour and \r\nno matter the religion.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Albania for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Walid Al-Moualem, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like to congratulate Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the seventieth session and to wish \r\nhim success in leading the work of this session. I would \r\nalso like to thank his predecessor for his presidency at \r\nthe previous session.\r\nI greet the Assembly of this great international \r\nOrganization, which was originally established, with all \r\nits agencies, in order for peace and security to prevail \r\nin the world. I come from a country where security \r\nhas been disrupted and peace has been disturbed — a \r\ncountry that has been experiencing a brutal war for more \r\nthan four years. I greet the Assembly from a land \r\nbaptized by the blood of its people, who are fighting \r\nterrorism and defending their fellow citizens against \r\nterrorism, while waiting for the United Nations to fulfil \r\nits promises and implement its resolutions aimed at \r\ncombating terrorism.\r\nThe resolutions adopted by the Security Council \r\nunder Chapter VII are still just ink on paper, mentioned \r\nonly in press releases and media statements, while \r\non the ground the countries funding, sponsoring and \r\nsupporting terrorism are still fuelling extremism in the \r\nregion, still arming and training terrorists and sending \r\nthem to Syria and are indifferent to and unconcerned \r\nabout the implementation of those resolutions.\r\nI ask the Assembly, on behalf of the Syrians who \r\nare resisting this scourge, how long will the powerful \r\nMember States continue to intimidate other Member \r\nStates committed to international law and to ignore \r\nStates that disregard Security Council resolutions? \r\nWhat has the international community done to stop \r\nthose States from committing criminal acts against \r\nthe Syrian people? Why is there all this silence? The \r\ninternational community watched as this extremist \r\nideology spread until it reached Europe and struck \r\nthere as it is striking the Middle East now. It watched \r\nwhile sleeper cells were awakened and bombings and \r\nassassinations re-emerged in the West. The people of \r\nthose countries are not guilty, yet they are beginning \r\nto pay the price for some of their politicians’ support \r\nof terrorism.\r\nEveryone here knows better than most that terrorism \r\nis an ideology that recognizes no boundaries, and that \r\nwhen this monster is on the move, it is not limited to \r\n22/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nparticular countries. The terrorism of the Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Sham and of the Al-Nusra Front and \r\nother Al-Qaida-affiliated terrorist organizations is \r\nkilling the innocent, capturing women and bombarding \r\ncivilians with mortar shells. This terrorism is cutting \r\noff drinking water and destroying historic and cultural \r\nlandmarks, including those on the World Heritage List, \r\nwhich form part of the heritage of all humankind. The \r\nmost recent of such crimes was the destruction of the \r\ntemples of Baal Shamin and Bel and the brutal killing \r\nof archaeologists.\r\nWhy do some countries support other countries that \r\nare accustomed to exporting their crises beyond their \r\nborders? Why do they support them while knowing \r\nthat they only cause destruction? How can developed \r\ncountries that hold elections and have parliaments align \r\nthemselves with countries that do not have parliaments \r\nand do not recognize the rights of women, who represent \r\nhalf of society? How can the former accept such \r\npractices as sexual jihad, slaughter, cutting off hands \r\nand the systematic destruction of history, monuments \r\nand culture?\r\nIn the light of that situation, I affirm that Syria will \r\ncontinue to fight terrorism in word and deed. The Syrian \r\narmed forces are capable of cleansing the country of \r\nterrorists, despite the sacrifices involved and the high \r\nprices they have already paid and are continuing to pay. \r\nSyrian people from all backgrounds have also paid with \r\ntheir lives and in every other way in terms of security, \r\nthe economy and their livelihood.\r\nNow is the time for honesty and truth. It is the duty \r\nof the international community to stop the f low to Syria \r\nof terrorists, who, according to United Nations data, \r\nare coming from 100 countries to create a caliphate \r\nState. That State, as members all know, will not be \r\nlimited to Syria or Iraq. Those who wish to lead such \r\na caliphate have frequently stated that their goal is a \r\nState that stretches from Mecca throughout Europe, \r\na State that, according to them, will restore the glory \r\nof the caliphate. If the international community does \r\nnot stop States from supporting terrorism and sending \r\nterrorists, the fire that has broken out in Syria, Iraq and \r\nLibya will continue to spread.\r\nSyria has not stopped advocating political dialogue \r\nand practising what it preaches. Its earlier vision — that \r\nthe fight against terrorism must take priority if progress \r\nis to be made on other tracks — has proved to be \r\ncorrect. The Government cannot implement any \r\ndemocratic political measures related to elections, a \r\nconstitution or the like while terrorism is striking at \r\nhome and threatening innocent civilians in the country. \r\nHow can it ask the Syrian people to head to the ballot \r\nboxes when they are not safe either in the streets or in \r\ntheir homes because of the missiles and mortar shells \r\nlaunched against them by terrorist groups supported by \r\ncountries whose identities are well known?\r\nNevertheless, we were, and still are, believers in \r\npolitical dialogue within the parameters known to \r\nall, namely, the preservation of national sovereignty, \r\nthe unity of Syria’s territory and people, and the \r\nmaintenance of State institutions, which may, \r\nnonetheless, be developed and improved. Moreover, \r\nthere has to be an understanding that the only way \r\nto achieve a political solution is through a Syrian-led \r\nnational dialogue without any foreign interference. On \r\nthe basis of those conditions, Syria agreed to participate \r\nin a second Geneva conference on Syria and the first \r\nand second round of talks on Syria held in Moscow.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to announce that \r\nSyria agrees to participate in the four brainstorming \r\ncommittees of experts proposed by the Special Envoy \r\nStaffan de Mistura. Mr. De Mistura has repeatedly \r\nconfirmed that the role of these committees is mainly to \r\nexchange ideas and that they will conduct non-binding \r\npreliminary consultations whose agreed outputs can be \r\nused to prepare for the launching of the third Geneva \r\nconference on Syria.\r\nSome imagine that Syria’s acceptance of the \r\npolitical track — regardless of the form it takes, the \r\ninitiative it is based on and the name it is given — stems \r\nfrom what they term the weakness of Syria’s army \r\nand people on the ground. To them I say that Syria is \r\nstrong and continues to fight terrorism, and that the \r\nSyrian army and the Syrian people are united in the \r\nface of terrorism. Let no one think that, after all Syria’s \r\nsacrifices and steadfastness over more than four years, \r\nits adversaries can obtain through political means what \r\nthey could not win militarily or that they will achieve \r\nat the negotiating table what they failed to achieve on \r\nthe ground. The decision of the Syrian people lies in \r\nthe hands of the Syrian people alone, and no one can \r\ndeny them that right. I repeat: the decision of the Syrian \r\npeople lies in their hands alone and no one can strip them \r\nof that right. The Syrian armed forces have astonished \r\nthe world with their power, faith and persistence.\r\nThe important invitation of His Excellency President \r\nVladimir Putin aimed at establishing an international/\r\nregional coalition to counter terrorism received the \r\n15-29816 23/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nattention and support of the Syrian Government. \r\nTerrorism cannot be fought only from the air, and all the \r\nprevious operations to combat it have merely led to its \r\nspread and to further outbreaks. Air strikes are useless \r\nunless they are conducted in cooperation with the Syrian \r\narmed forces, which currently are alone in combating \r\nterrorism in Syria. Russian air strikes in Syria, which \r\nwere launched at the request of and in coordination \r\nwith the Syrian Government, are effectively supporting \r\nthe Syrian efforts to combat terrorism.\r\nThe so-called Arab Spring was a spring only for \r\nIsrael and its covert and known allies. Israel continues \r\nto attack Syria while the world watches. Israel is \r\narming the terrorists and treating them in its hospitals. \r\nIt is helping them with its intelligence services and \r\nsupporting them, so that they will stand between it and \r\nthe Syrian armed forces across the border. While those \r\nterrorists are being weakened, it is intervening directly \r\nthrough air strikes and artillery shelling, just as Turkey \r\ndid and is still doing, whether in Aleppo or Idlib, and \r\njust as Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are eager to shed \r\nSyrian blood by various means, are doing.\r\nThe continued support for terrorists and the \r\nescalation of their attacks on citizens in most \r\nregions and cities of Syria have led to shortages of \r\nbasic commodities and services in many areas. The \r\ninhuman sanctions imposed by the European Union \r\nand the United States of America have exacerbated the \r\nhardships of Syrian civilians.\r\nMy Government is cooperating with the United \r\nNations and its humanitarian agencies within the \r\nframework of response plans, agreed with the Syrian \r\nGovernment, to meet the basic needs of our citizens, \r\nespecially those forced by terrorist activities to f lee \r\ntheir homes, many of whom have gone to neighbouring \r\ncountries. Some of those countries have accommodated \r\nthem in camps for weapons training or in places that \r\nresemble detention and isolation facilities. I stress that \r\nthe Syrian Government guarantees a safe return and a \r\ndecent life for all citizens who are willing to return. \r\nAt the same time, Syria continues to make every effort \r\nto deliver aid from international organizations to all \r\nSyrian citizens, without discrimination, wherever they \r\nmay be.\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic reiterates its support \r\nfor the full restoration of the occupied Syrian Golan to \r\nthe line of 4 June 1967. It also emphasizes its rejection \r\nof all actions taken by Israel, the occupying Power, to \r\nalter the geographic or demographic characteristics of \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan, in clear violation of relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, in particular resolutions \r\n497 (1981) and 465 (1980). Furthermore, Syria confirms \r\nthat the issue of Palestine is of central concern to \r\nthe Syrian people, who support the inalienable and \r\nlegitimate rights of the brotherly Palestinian people, \r\nin particular the right of return, the right to self-\r\ndetermination and the right to the establishment of an \r\nindependent State on their own land, with Jerusalem as \r\nits capital.\r\nAt the end of 2013, Syria, acting on a proposal \r\nmade by the President of the Russian Federation, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Vladimir Putin, acceded to the \r\nConvention on the Prohibition of the Development, \r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons \r\nand on Their Destruction, with the aim of establishing \r\nin the Middle East a zone free of nuclear weapons and \r\nall weapons of mass destruction. It also wanted to \r\ndemonstrate to the whole world its opposition to any \r\nuse of chemical weapons. Syria fulfilled the obligations \r\nthat resulted from its accession to the Convention and \r\ncompleted its commitments despite the prevailing \r\ndifficult situation. Thanks to Syria’s cooperation, the \r\nJoint Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition of \r\nChemical Weapons and the United Nations was able to \r\ncomplete its task.\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic would like to commend \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran for its steadfastness \r\nin achieving the historic agreement that fulfils the \r\naspirations of the brotherly people of Iran. The \r\nagreement recognizes Iran’s right to use nuclear energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes and lifts the sanctions imposed \r\nagainst Iran and the freeze on its assets. It also opens up \r\ninternational relations for that brotherly country. The \r\nagreement proves that a diligent and serious diplomatic \r\napproach can be successful in overcoming all obstacles \r\nand can lead to a peaceful and just solution to a difficult \r\nissue.\r\nSyria stresses that establishing a zone free of all \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East is \r\nunachievable unless Israel, the only nuclear Power in \r\nthe region, accedes to all the treaties banning such \r\nweapons. Furthermore, with respect to its nuclear \r\nfacilities, Israel should conclude a safeguards agreement \r\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency. At the \r\nsame time, Syria emphasizes the right of all countries \r\nto acquire and develop nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes.\r\n24/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nThe imposition of unethical, unilateral and coercive \r\nmeasures by the United States and the European Union \r\ncontradicts the rules of international law and the \r\nprinciples of free trade. On that basis, we congratulate \r\nCuba on reaching an agreement with the United States \r\nthat lifts the blockade imposed on it. It remains for all \r\nunilateral, coercive measures imposed on Syria and on \r\nthe people of other countries, such as the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela and Belarus, to be lifted.\r\nFinally, all those who claim to care about the \r\nsecurity and safety of the Syrian people should know \r\nthat if we are to achieve victory over terrorism and \r\naccomplish economic and political reforms, it is \r\nessential that the counter-terrorism resolutions of the \r\nSecurity Council be fully and honestly implemented. \r\nOnly then can we begin the countdown to the end of \r\nwar in Syria. Only then will we arrive at the final \r\nmoments and can prepare to implement what has been \r\nagreed through political dialogue.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Gunnar Bragi Sveinsson, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Iceland.\r\nMr. Sveinsson (Iceland): The world has changed \r\nenormously since the establishment of the United \r\nNations 70 years ago. It has become a real world body \r\nwith 193 Member States. The United Nations has \r\nestablished a peacekeeping structure, overseen the \r\ndevelopment of a strong human rights framework and \r\nset up key agencies for development, humanitarian \r\nissues and the environment. And we have seen the \r\ncodification of international law under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations through such landmark treaties as \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. \r\nOver the same period, the United Nations has witnessed \r\nthe agonies and tragedies of several generations around \r\nthe world —tragedies brought on by poverty, conflict \r\nand natural disasters.\r\nThe United Nations has not always met our \r\nexpectations, but it is the only organization through \r\nwhich all countries can work to solve the problems \r\nthat we face today and to prevent potential problems \r\nin the future. This anniversary year provides a striking \r\nexample of how the world’s nations, within the forum of \r\nthe United Nations, can work together to chart a future \r\nfor our peoples. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda are achievements of which we should \r\nbe proud. Iceland, together with many other Member \r\nStates, worked hard to achieve the balanced result \r\nwe see today. We are particularly pleased with the \r\nprominence of gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women, which are key to sustainable development.\r\nWe are also pleased that the sustainable \r\nmanagement of natural resources is central to both \r\nthose Agendas. Eliminating hunger will require food \r\nsecurity. That can be achieved only by safeguarding \r\nand sustainably managing the only two sources of food \r\nwe have: the ocean and the land. Inefficient fisheries \r\nmanagement and the lack of infrastructure in that field \r\ncost our societies around $50 billion every year. Also, \r\narable land the size of South Africa becomes degraded \r\nevery year. We now have a blueprint for fixing that, and \r\nIceland is committed to contributing to those efforts.\r\nAnother highly significant aim in terms of the \r\nsustainable management of natural resources is Goal \r\n7, on affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern \r\nenergy for all. We need to aim for the elimination of \r\ncarbon-based fuels and, in the meantime, to channel the \r\nenormous amount of subsidies granted in the fossil-fuel \r\nsector — some $14.5 billion a day — towards renewable \r\nenergy resources. That would be a good start, and here, \r\nthose who count need to be counted.\r\nIceland also worked hard with others to include \r\nin the 2030 Agenda language that deals with \r\nnon-communicable diseases, including neurological \r\ndisorders. \r\nThe universal nature of our new, common Goals \r\nrequires each of our States to contribute at the national, \r\nregional and global levels. None of us can succeed \r\nalone. Iceland is committed to playing its part in \r\nreaching those ambitious Goals.\r\nEverywhere we are witnessing the drastic \r\nconsequences of climate change. Last month, with \r\nparticipants from other Arctic countries, I took part in \r\nthe Global Leadership Conference in Alaska, aimed at \r\ndrawing attention to the impacts of climate change, which \r\nare particularly revealing in that region. Temperatures \r\nin the Arctic are increasing at more than twice the \r\naverage global rate. The region’s fragile ecosystem \r\nis increasingly at risk, and Arctic communities are \r\nexperiencing at first hand the challenges of dealing with \r\na rapidly changing climate. The consequences are far \r\nreaching, as shrinking glaciers in the North contribute \r\nto higher sea levels in the South.\r\nThere is still time to turn things around. The \r\nmeeting on the United Nations Framework Convention \r\n15-29816 25/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\non Climate Change in Paris in December will be a \r\nchance — maybe our last one — to put ourselves on \r\ntrack towards a sustainable future and to take decisions \r\nbased on best available science. Iceland is committed to \r\nan ambitious, long-term global climate agreement and \r\nintends, working collectively with other countries in \r\nEurope, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 per \r\ncent in 2030.\r\nWe have been asked to focus on the road ahead for \r\npeace, security and human rights. When injustice is the \r\neveryday experience of a large part of the population, \r\nand when people have no voice, peace and security are \r\nat risk. And without peace and security, we will not \r\nachieve sustainable development. At the same time, \r\npeace and security considerations cannot be used as a \r\njustification for violating human rights. \r\nThe imposition of the death penalty should not be \r\njustified by the pretext of needing to maintain order \r\nand security. In that regard, the case of Ali Mohammed \r\nal-Nimr in Saudi Arabia, a minor when his alleged \r\ncrimes took place, is particularly worrying. I call on \r\nSaudi Arabia to uphold its international obligations and \r\ncommute his sentence.\r\nOne characteristic of a just and humane society \r\nis the way it treats its minorities and the most \r\nvulnerable. Iceland will continue to work with others \r\nfor non-discrimination, including on the basis of sexual \r\norientation and gender identity. Human rights are for all \r\nmen, all women, all girls and all boys, not just for some. \r\n“We the people” includes everyone.\r\nMr. Alrowaiei (Bahrain), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nIceland will continue to be a champion of gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women, as are many \r\nother committed Member States. At the beginning of \r\nthe year I co-hosted, with my colleague from Suriname, \r\na successful Barbershop Conference here at the United \r\nNations. The aim was to get others to join in getting \r\nmen to be more active on the issue of gender equality. \r\nI saw it also as support for the He For She campaign \r\nrun by UN-Women. In the light of that success, Iceland \r\nintends to host Barbershops in other international \r\norganizations of which we are members.\r\nThe small size of our world is being set into sharp \r\nrelief by the ongoing migrant and refugee situation. \r\nParticularly in Europe, well before the Syrian crisis, \r\nwe witnessed the desperate efforts of men and \r\nwomen fleeing their own countries, often with tragic \r\nconsequences, in search of a safe future for themselves \r\nand their children. The search for a better life is nothing \r\nnew. About one fifth of Iceland’s population left our \r\ncountry in the late nineteenth century in the face of \r\nextreme poverty and harsh weather conditions. For many \r\nIcelanders and millions of European who undertook the \r\nperilous journey to North America, emigration was a \r\nmatter of survival. Others were escaping injustice and \r\npolitical systems in which they had no voice.\r\nThe current refugee crisis, however, is \r\nunprecedented in recent times. The term migration \r\nhardly captures the severity of the situation. This is an \r\nexodus. We have all seen the figures. This year alone, \r\nsome 500,000 refugees and migrants have crossed \r\nthe Mediterranean to Europe, and millions have f led \r\nto neighbouring countries. Here, I would like to pay \r\ntribute to Syria’s neighbours, who have quietly and \r\nresolutely given shelter to the great majority of the \r\nrefugees. The conflict in Syria, with its complex roots \r\nin the larger conflicts in the region, has produced a \r\nscale of suffering that we all hoped never to see again. \r\nThe long-term solution has to be to solve the conflict in \r\nSyria, and others like it, by political means.\r\nThe Security Council bears the primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. We call on all Security Council \r\nmembers, in the words of the Charter, to “unite their \r\nstrength” to halt the bloodshed in Syria. The situation \r\nis already having consequences far beyond the region. \r\nMeanwhile, it is the humanitarian duty of the rest of \r\nthe world to seek ways to reduce the suffering of the \r\nrefugees. These are extreme circumstances and call for \r\nextraordinary measures. \r\nThe Icelandic Government has decided to allocate \r\n$16 million to deal with the crisis and to support the \r\nvital work of front-line United Nations institutions, like \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees, the World Food Programme and UNICEF, \r\nand to welcome increased numbers of refugees to \r\nIceland. This is, however, not a numbers game. There \r\nare different circumstances in different countries. But \r\nwe all have to do what we can. These are defining \r\nmoments in history.\r\nIceland reiterates its strong conviction that the \r\nonly path to peace between Israel and Palestine is the \r\ntwo-State solution. Both sides need to commit fully to \r\nthat solution, and they must refrain from actions that \r\nundermine it. Of continuing and deep concern is the \r\nhumanitarian situation of the Palestinians, particularly \r\n26/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nin Gaza, where we continue to call for the lifting of \r\nthe blockade. Israel must abide by its obligations under \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights law. \r\nThat includes an immediate halt to the demolition of \r\nPalestinian homes and an end to the displacement of \r\nPalestinians from their land. Terrorist activity on the \r\npart of Palestinian elements is also totally unacceptable \r\nand can only undermine peace. We condemn all acts of \r\nviolence against civilians. The safety and well-being of \r\ncivilians on both sides must always be ensured. \r\nWhile the situation in the Middle East region \r\ngives little cause for optimism, there has recently \r\nbeen a triumph of diplomacy over conflict. I would \r\nlike to congratulate all the parties that achieved the \r\nbreakthrough agreement on the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action on Iran’s nuclear programme. We hope \r\nto see that agreement contribute to greater stability in \r\nthe region. We should be careful not to forget other \r\ndisputes, which, if not attended to, could f lare up. Here, \r\nI am thinking of the Western Sahara.\r\nOn this seventieth anniversary of the foundation \r\nof the United Nations, we should recall the basic \r\ntenets of the Charter of the United Nations and related \r\ninstruments. They include refraining from “the threat or \r\nuse of force against the territorial integrity or political \r\nindependence of any State”. It is a matter of grave \r\nconcern when a permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil acts to undermine the territorial integrity \r\nof another State. The rule of law and the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes are of existential importance for \r\nsmall States like mine.\r\nThe United Nations is not perfect. I would like, \r\nhowever, to compliment Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon on the determination with which he has \r\napproached the Organization’s shortcomings. There \r\nis important work under way to revitalize the General \r\nAssembly. Iceland welcomes resolution 69/321 on that \r\ntopic, in particular with regard to the appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General. After a succession of eight men \r\nin the position of Secretary-General, it is high time for \r\nqualified female candidates to be seriously considered \r\nfor that most important international position. The \r\nsame applies to the position of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The gender imbalance in high-level \r\npositions must be addressed if we wish to strengthen \r\nthe credibility of the United Nations.\r\nIceland has long supported an expansion in the \r\npermanent and non-permanent seats in the Security \r\nCouncil. It is a difficult process, but we cannot ignore \r\nthe current increasingly indefensible situation, in which \r\nthe Security Council represents the world as it was in \r\n1945. The danger is that its authority will gradually be \r\nundermined if it does not better reflect the world as it \r\nis.\r\nIceland is ready to look at all options for squaring \r\nthe circle. In the meantime, Iceland has stated its \r\nsupport for the initiative by France and Mexico on \r\nregulating the use of the veto and for the code of conduct \r\non Security Council actions against genocide and other \r\ncrimes against humanity, drafted by the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group of States.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Shaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed \r\nAl-Khalifa, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain.\r\nShaikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, it is my pleasure to warmly congratulate \r\nthe President and his friendly country, the Kingdom of \r\nDenmark, on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. I wish him sustained \r\nsuccess in directing the work of the General Assembly \r\nand in bolstering the role that the Assembly plays \r\nin addressing the challenges that the world and the \r\ninternational community as a whole face today. I also \r\nwish to express my appreciation to his predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the General \r\nAssembly at the sixty-ninth session, for all his efforts \r\nin conducting the business of that session and for his \r\nconcrete initiatives aimed at attaining our common \r\ngoals.\r\nI would also like to express my deep appreciation \r\nfor the hard work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho spares no effort to improve the effectiveness \r\nof the Organization in the face of the increasingly \r\ncomplex problems and crises in the world. I commend \r\nhis comprehensive annual report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/70/1) and the important steps that he \r\nhas taken to address the numerous challenges on issues, \r\nincluding sustainable development, climate change, \r\nconflicts, humanitarian disasters and the refugee crisis, \r\nin addition to the deadly diseases, poverty and hunger \r\nin many developing countries.\r\nAt this juncture, I wish to totally submit myself to \r\nthe will of Allah and express our heartfelt condolences \r\nto the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, His Majesty \r\nKing Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud of the brotherly \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, and to the Muslim nation as \r\n15-29816 27/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\na whole, following the tragic stampede that occurred \r\nduring this year’s Hajj a few days ago. We highly \r\nvalue the great and historic role played by the sisterly \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia and its blessed efforts as \r\nguardian of that holy land and as servant of the guests \r\nof the sacred shrine, dedicating all means necessary \r\nto the organization of the Hajj and Umrah and their \r\nrites. Anyone who denies that fact ignores the scope of \r\nthe responsibilities that the sisterly Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia discharges so ably. We strongly deplore the \r\nfalse allegations made by President Hassan Rouhani \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran in his statement before \r\nthe General Assembly (see A/70/PV.13) and reject any \r\noffense against or belittling of the tremendous efforts \r\nmade over the years by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\r\nA few days ago, the General Assembly took \r\nan important step for the welfare of humankind by \r\nadopting the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1). We made it a point to participate in \r\nthe process, which is consistent with our full support \r\nfor United Nations actions aimed at furthering \r\ndevelopment goals and with the Kingdom of Bahrain’s \r\nrecord of achieving remarkable results in the fields \r\nof education, health, youth empowerment, poverty \r\nalleviation, literacy and the enhancement of human \r\nrights, as documented in international reports.\r\nBahrain, as a pioneering country, has been \r\nclassified in the United Nations Human Development \r\nIndex as being among the countries with a very high \r\nlevel of human development. It has scored a 5 per cent \r\neconomic growth rate over the past five years, thanks \r\nto the reform process instituted by His Majesty King \r\nHamad bin Issa Al Khalifa of the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nand his profound interest in meeting the aspirations of the \r\npeople of Bahrain at the political, economic and social \r\nlevels. We shall persevere in our development efforts by \r\ndevising plans and programmes for the implementation \r\nof the new post-2015 sustainable development agenda. \r\nIn the context of our efforts to enhance the \r\nSustainable Development Goals contained in the new \r\nAgenda, my country will host, on 6 and 7 December, \r\nthe Ministerial Conference on the Implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in the \r\nArab States. It will be the first regional conference to \r\nbe held anywhere following the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThe world testified to the success and excellent \r\nrecord of the Kingdom of Bahrain in the field of \r\nsustainable development when, here in New York, the \r\nInternational Telecommunication Union conferred \r\nan Information and Communications Technologies in \r\nSustainable Development Award for 2015 on His Royal \r\nHighness Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa, the \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Bahrain, thereby \r\nconfirming the esteem in which the Kingdom and His \r\nRoyal Highness are held, as evidenced by a series of \r\ndistinguished awards in the recent past.\r\nGiven that the environment is one of the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development, we want to \r\nstress the importance of solidarity and joint action \r\nto address the major challenges of climate change. \r\nWe look forward to the twenty-first session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nlater this year in Paris. We hope that the session will \r\nresult in a binding and ambitious agreement to deal \r\nwith that dangerous phenomenon and its repercussions, \r\nespecially on small island developing States.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly \r\ncoincides with the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations, an Organization that we all cherish, whose \r\nindispensable role we all appreciate and which, for us, is \r\nindispensable. We shall relentlessly endeavour to attain \r\nits goals, especially in the light of the tragedies and \r\nhardships faced by humankind at the end of the Second \r\nWorld War, with its huge toll in lives, the displacement \r\nof peoples and the obliteration of a great number of \r\ncultural monuments in many parts of the world. All \r\nof that should make us firmly united, cooperative and \r\ntransparent, so as to avoid the recurrence of such past \r\ntragedies and to lay strong foundations for international \r\ncooperation leading to safe future for humankind.\r\nIt is no secret that the Organization’s noble \r\nhumanitarian goals have not been fully attained, yet \r\nwe still maintain the hope of achieving them, thereby \r\nclosing a painful and cruel chapter and inaugurating \r\na new era without wars. Our region has had its share \r\nof wars — war after war, albeit of various types and \r\nobjectives — and all were destructive. We have seen \r\nconfrontations with occupiers. We have seen opposition \r\nto foreign interference that has sought to impose \r\nhegemony, undermine national sovereignty and exploit \r\nextremist groups and organizations as well as those \r\nfinancing them in order to jeopardize any national \r\ngains, destroy cultural heritage and obliterate national \r\nand regional midentities.\r\nTaking on those challenges is not easy, nor is the \r\nway carpeted with f lowers. Rather, it is a long and \r\n28/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\narduous road, requiring uninterrupted work, persistent \r\nefforts and collective confrontation with the difficulties \r\nthat need to be overcome. Paramount among them is \r\nthe disregard by some – Iran, for example — of the \r\nprinciples of non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof other States and of good-neighbourliness. There is \r\nalso the exploitation of extremist groups, the provision \r\nof safe havens to fugitives, the opening of training \r\ncamps for terrorist groups and the smuggling of arms \r\nand explosives. My country has experienced that \r\ndirectly. Bahraini citizens and expatriates, the security \r\npersonnel protecting them, and the nation at large have \r\nbeen the targets of murder and other criminal acts that \r\nhave claimed the lives of 16 security personnel and \r\ninjured some 3,000 people.\r\nThose dangerous criminal acts go even further.\r\nBarely two days ago, the security authorities in the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain discovered a cache of locally \r\nmade bombs in the heart of a densely populated area. \r\nThe cache included some 1.5 tons of highly explosive \r\nmaterial destined for use in the manufacturing of such \r\npotent explosives as C4, RDX and TNT, together with \r\nother chemical substances and a number of explosive \r\ndevices ready for use, automatic weapons and guns, \r\nhand grenades, ammunition and wireless equipment.\r\nFor that reason, I would like to state that the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain and a number of sisterly countries \r\nin the region have attempted, through various ways \r\nand means, to invite Iran to seek normal neighbourly \r\nrelations based on respect for the sovereignty and \r\nindependence of nations and non-interference in their \r\ninternal affairs. The security and stability of a State \r\ncannot be detrimental to those of another State. Iran \r\nwould be better advised not to squander the resources \r\nof its people on foreign adventures but rather to use \r\nthose resources to achieve development and progress \r\nand build bridges with its neighbours, so that all may \r\nlive together in peace. Iran has responded in a negative \r\nmanner, however, and we were left with no choice but \r\nto recall the Kingdom’s Ambassador to Iran and declare \r\nthe chargé d’affaires of the Iranian Embassy a persona \r\nnon grata, as part of the measures we have taken to \r\nprotect our people and interests.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain and its sister countries \r\nof the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) have not \r\nhesitated to support Yemen in response to a request by \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen, that we help the \r\nbrotherly people of Yemen, who have been confronted \r\nwith rebel groups that benefit from Iranian support. \r\nThose groups failed to live up to their commitments \r\nand took over the institutions of the Yemeni State. Our \r\naim was to curb the deterioration in the security and \r\nhumanitarian situation there. The position taken by the \r\nGCC in support of Yemen is a matter of principle and a \r\nlong-standing position arising from our conviction that \r\nYemen’s security and stability constitute an integral \r\npart, not only of the security of the Arabian peninsula \r\nbut also of the entire region at large.\r\nThat has inevitably led to military confrontation, \r\nas we had no other choice available to us. All roads \r\nwere blocked by the obstinacy of the rebel groups and \r\ntheir belligerent designs with regard to the people of \r\nYemen and the region. To paraphrase my brother, the \r\nlate Prince Saud Al Faisal, we are not warmongers, \r\nbut when the war drums are beaten, we will be ready. I \r\nsay that to show that the GCC countries are, and have \r\nalways been, advocates of peace, not war.\r\nWe are steadfast in our efforts to fulfil the \r\naspirations of the Yemeni people, and we shall remain \r\nfaithful to our position until those who have taken \r\nup arms have laid them down, until those who have \r\noverthrown the legitimate Government have abandoned \r\ntheir greed and put an end to the occupation of the \r\nState institutions, and until those who have broken \r\nthe 2014 peace agreement have come back to their \r\nsenses. Only then can the situation be conducive to \r\nbringing together all the factions of the Yemeni people \r\nthrough a constructive national dialogue based on the \r\nGCC Initiative and its implementation mechanism, \r\nthe outcome of the comprehensive national dialogue \r\nand the Riyadh conference and the unconditional \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 2216 \r\n(2015), which provides the basis for a settlement of the \r\nYemeni crisis.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the United Nations in \r\nthat respect. While we appreciate the humanitarian \r\nefforts of the United Nations in favour of Yemen and \r\nits people and the remarkable role played by the King \r\nSalman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre in Yemen \r\nin conjunction with assistance provided by the GCC \r\nand other friendly countries, we urge the international \r\ncommunity to intensify its assistance and alleviate the \r\nsuffering of the Yemeni people.\r\nWe regret that many States have become a breeding \r\nground for terrorist groups and organizations, which \r\nhave expanded under the cover of various sectarian and \r\nreligious affiliations with the sole purpose of advancing \r\n15-29816 29/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\ntheir own agendas aimed at controlling nations and \r\nobliterating the will of peoples. The Syrian experience \r\nis an abiding example. That country has become an \r\narena for confrontation among terrorist organizations \r\nsuch as Daesh, Hizbullah and others, which has led, \r\ninter alia, to the destruction of ancient cultural sites in \r\nthe country.\r\nAs Syria goes down this treacherous and slippery \r\nslope, we call for an end to the situation and the return \r\nof that sisterly country to its previous condition of unity, \r\nharmony, security and stability. To that end, foreign \r\nmilitary intervention must cease, and a unanimously \r\naccepted political settlement, consistent with the final \r\ncommuniqué of the Action Group for Syria (A/66/865, \r\nannex), must be reached.\r\nReference to Syria automatically draws our \r\nattention to a related humanitarian crisis that requires \r\nall Member States to take concrete and tangible action \r\nto address it. I speak now of the crisis of the Syrian \r\nrefugees and displaced persons. It represents the worst \r\nramification of the current situation in Syria and is a \r\nmajor humanitarian disaster, unprecedented since the \r\nSecond World War.\r\nThe GCC member States have not remained idle \r\nin the face of that tragic situation. They have taken \r\ncomprehensive and practical humanitarian action by \r\nhosting around 3 million Syrian brothers and sisters \r\nand granting them permits to stay, with all the attendant \r\nrights, such as free education, health care, the right to \r\nemployment and an acceptable standard of living. In \r\nthat respect, we also appreciate the major contribution \r\nof the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, which is providing \r\nSyrians with care and opportunities for a decent life. We \r\nalso call for concerted efforts to support Jordan and to \r\nshare the great burden that it has taken up. I should also \r\nmention the considerable efforts of Egypt, Lebanon and \r\nTurkey in bearing that humanitarian burden.\r\nWith regard to the sisterly country of Iraq, we \r\nhope that the great efforts of Prime Minister Haider \r\nAl Abadi to unite the Iraqi people and overcome the \r\nchallenges facing his country at this critical juncture \r\nwill be crowned with success and that stability, security \r\nand peace will be restored. We call for the protection \r\nof Iraq’s territorial integrity, an end to foreign \r\ninterventions, especially by Iran, and the preservation \r\nof Iraq’s stability. We call for an all-out war against \r\nterrorist groups such as Daesh and other armed militias \r\nthat have found in Iraq favourable conditions for their \r\nactivities.\r\nLibya is not immune to the threats posed by \r\ninternational terrorist groups, and the situation there \r\nhas deteriorated, as we all know. The only way out is for \r\nall of the parties to the Libyan crisis to commit to giving \r\nprecedence to the highest interest of the nation in order \r\nto restore its security, stability and unity. We welcome \r\nthe text for the framework to create a Government of \r\nNational Accord so as to put an end to the fighting and \r\nbloodshed in this sisterly country.\r\nWe reiterate the consistent position of the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain, which rejects terrorism in all its forms, \r\nregardless of its motivations or the entity backing or \r\nfinancing it. Terrorist acts by Daesh are unprecedented \r\nand constitute crimes against humanity. Such terrorism \r\nwill stop only if a collective effort is made at all levels \r\nto destroy its sources of financing. That is consistent \r\nwith our commitment to combating that threat, which \r\njeopardizes the security and safety of our countries, as \r\nwell as our shared humanity. \r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain, in cooperation with the \r\ncountries of the region and with the support of our allies, \r\nwill work to defeat that threat. To that end, we have ben \r\nparticipating in the efforts of the Global Coalition to \r\nCounter Daesh, militarily, logistically, intellectually \r\nand in the field of communications.\r\nIn that context, in November last year, the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain hosted the Manama Meeting on Combating \r\nthe Financing of Terrorism. This November we will \r\nhost a conference on the protection of civil society \r\ninstitutions against the risk of being exploited as \r\nchannels for funds intended for terrorists. In the near \r\nfuture, we will also organize a conference on protection \r\nagainst improvised explosive devices, which are the \r\nfavourite and most frequently used weapons of terrorist \r\ngroups all over the world.\r\nWhat is taking place today in Al-Quds Al-Sharif \r\noffends the feelings of all Muslims around the world, as \r\nthey witness the violations committed by the occupying \r\nIsraeli authorities and Israeli extremist groups against \r\nthe sanctity of the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque Compound. \r\nSuch illegal and inhuman acts run the risk of wrecking \r\nany chance for peace. Instead they create an atmosphere \r\nfilled with more tension, violence, extremism and \r\nhatred, all of which do not contribute to building the \r\nhuman relations and mutual respect that all religions \r\nadvocate. \r\nNor do such acts contribute to building peaceful \r\nsocieties that preserve national dignity and a culture \r\n30/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nof peaceful coexistence. To quote Egyptian President \r\nAnwar Sadat’s iconic phrase before the Israeli Knesset, \r\n“no one can build his happiness at the expense of the \r\nmisery of others”.\r\nAttaining that happiness will be possible only \r\nwhen the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people are \r\ngranted through the establishment of an independent \r\nPalestinian State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nwithin the borders of 4 June 1967. Occupation, \r\ncoercive practices and the construction and expansion \r\nof settlements should come to an end. The right of \r\nPalestinians to return to their towns and villages, \r\nconsistent with the relevant international resolutions, \r\nthe two-State solution and the Arab Peace Initiative, \r\nmust be acknowledged. \r\nIn that connection, we welcome the raising of \r\nthe Palestinian f lag at United Nations Headquarters \r\nas a first step of great symbolic value, underscoring \r\ninternational support for the right of the Palestinian \r\nState to full membership in the United Nations, which \r\nwe look forward to in the near future.\r\nWe want to reaffirm the importance of the agreement \r\nbetween Iran and the P5+1 group on the Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme. We hope that it will contribute to security \r\nand stability in the region. However, we believe that \r\nthe agreement does not eliminate all sources of tension \r\nresulting from Iran’s attitudes towards the countries of \r\nthe region. It covers some future issues, but it does not \r\ntouch on the real problems that we face today, since Iran \r\nwill attempt to destabilize the region and its security by \r\nproviding support to terrorist organizations, including \r\nby smuggling weapons and explosives, as I mentioned \r\nearlier in detail. Iran is also openly interfering in \r\nthe internal affairs of our States. It has occupied the \r\nthree islands belonging to the United Arab Emirates, \r\nnamely, Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs, \r\nand refuses to end that occupation either through \r\ndirect negotiations or by accepting arbitration by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice..\r\nIn that context, we reaffirm the importance of a \r\nMiddle East nuclear-free-zone, including the Arabian \r\nGulf region, as well as the need for Israel to adhere to \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand to place its nuclear facilities under comprehensive \r\nsafeguards if tge International Atomic Energy Agency. \r\nI regret that no agreement was reached at the 2015 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, recently held in \r\nNew York .\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its full support \r\nfor the Arab Republic of Egypt and the tireless efforts of \r\nPresident Abdel Fattah Al Sisi to achieve development, \r\nprogress and prosperity for the Egyptian people, \r\nconsolidate the foundations of a modern State and \r\ncombat terrorism. The building of a new Suez Canal and \r\nthe other major projects decided at the Sharm El-Sheikh \r\nConference to support the Egyptian economy clearly \r\ndemonstrate the determination to enhance genuine \r\ndevelopment so that Egypt, the land of civilization, will \r\nremain a source of security and prosperity for all and \r\na pillar of the Arab world. In that way, it can continue \r\nplaying its leading role in our common Arab endeavours \r\nto defend our cause and our national security.\r\nSimilarly, we would like to put on record our \r\nconsistent and principled position vis-à-vis the \r\nMoroccan Sahara question. We express our support for \r\nthe territorial integrity of Morocco and the efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations to find a negotiated political settlement \r\naccepted by all parties on the basis of the Moroccan \r\ninitiative on self-government.\r\nConfronted with such daunting challenges to our \r\nregion’s long-term security and stability, we need \r\nmore than ever to reflect deeply and seriously on how \r\nto create a mechanism for collective action that can \r\nbring all Middle Eastern States together with a view to \r\nconsolidating security and stability. We need to discuss \r\namong ourselves, with clarity and transparency, all \r\nthose issues and reach solutions to build confidence \r\nthrough practical policies and steady progress. We \r\nwould then be able to preserve what we have already \r\nachieved for our peoples and countries in terms of \r\nconstruction, comprehensive development and mutual \r\nunderstanding and cooperation. Such a mechanism \r\nwould preserve the sovereignty of our countries and \r\ntheir territorial integrity and ensure non-interference \r\nin their internal affairs. \r\nBetter relations would also ensue, based on mutual \r\nrespect for the principles of good-neighbourliness and \r\nthe non-use or threat of use of force. We would be able \r\nto build on the common characteristics that unite us, \r\nincluding our religious and cultural heritage and our \r\ndiversity. That would allow for better management of \r\nour collective resources so as to achieve food and water \r\nsecurity, build a genuine and lasting peace for all and \r\nachieve economic and development progress in the \r\ncontext of peaceful coexistence.\r\nI want to conclude by stating that the many \r\nachievements of the Kingdom of Bahrain confirm our \r\n15-29816 31/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nconfidence in our approach and our persistence in our \r\npolicy of perpetual improvement and comprehensive \r\ngrowth, while enhancing our country’s security and \r\npreserving our identity. We defend ourselves with one \r\nhand and work to build a modern State with the other, \r\na State based on justice, the rule of law and plurality, \r\nand popular participation in the decision-making \r\nprocess, without exclusion or discrimination. Our \r\nforeign relations are wide open and are built on strong \r\nfoundations and principles, most notably respect for the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, efforts at the regional \r\nand international levels, and cooperation with our \r\nbrothers aimed at achieving a peaceful life and a lasting \r\nand comprehensive peace for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on Her Excellency Ms. Aurelia Frick, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Minister for Education and Minister \r\nfor Cultural Affairs of the Principality of Liechtenstein.\r\nMs. Frick (Liechtenstein): It is an honour to be \r\nback in the Assembly, especially as Liechtenstein \r\nis celebrating the twenty-fifth anniversary of its \r\nmembership in the United Nations. We may not have \r\nbeen among the earliest countries to join the United \r\nNations, but we certainly were and remain among those \r\nwho did so with full conviction. Today, United Nations \r\nmembership is a key platform for our Government’s \r\nforeign policy. The Organization enjoys strong \r\napproval among our population, two thirds of which \r\nhave expressed favourable views in recent polls.\r\nFor people to approve of the United Nations is \r\nimportant, of course. After all, the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations is explicitly written on behalf of the \r\npeoples of the world. But we must ask: what about \r\npeople who are more directly affected by its work than \r\nthe population of Liechtenstein? In celebrating the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations, we must \r\nask ourselves what would approval ratings be among \r\nthe people of Syria, Haiti, the Central African Republic, \r\nUkraine or Sri Lanka. Are we achieving the purposes \r\nof the Charter that we fought so hard for seventy years \r\nago in San Francisco?\r\nThere is much to be proud of even when just \r\nlooking back at the recent past. The United Nations-\r\nled response to the Ebola crisis in West Africa saved \r\nthousands of lives, and it has prepared us to act with \r\neven more resolve in the future. The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals have had a catalytic effect on our \r\ndevelopment efforts and paved the way for the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), \r\na visionary blueprint for sustainable development. The \r\nUnited Nations continues to provide emergency relief, \r\neducation, health care and other services to millions \r\nof people around the globe. The United Nations is \r\nthe strongest symbol for human rights, the rule of \r\nlaw, gender equality and the protection of vulnerable \r\npopulations.\r\nPeople around the world place their faith in \r\nthe Organization, but all too often, they have been \r\ndisappointed. It is true that the United Nations has a huge \r\ntask. Mistakes are unavoidable, and at times, perhaps, \r\nthe same can even be said of failure. Nonetheless, there \r\ncan be no justification when the Organization fails at \r\nthe very core of its mission. There is no justification \r\nwhen the very people who should be protecting \r\ncivilians and children exploit them instead in the most \r\nabusive way possible. There is no justification for the \r\nfailure of diplomacy in Syria, with civilians suffering \r\nfrom unspeakable violence and terrorist extremism \r\ntaking over an entire region. We should not look for \r\njustifications. We need to look for solutions. We need \r\nto do better.\r\nThe maintenance of peace and security is at the \r\nheart of the Charter. Therefore, in the eyes of the \r\nworld, the work of the Security Council has a decisive \r\neffect on whether the Organization as a whole is seen \r\ns a success or a failure. Like many others, we want the \r\nSecurity Council to act with resolve and be effective \r\nand be guided by a common sense of purpose. That is \r\nprimarily the task of the Council members themselves. \r\nOthers, however, must contribute, as well. The Council \r\nworks on our behalf, and we are bound to carry out its \r\ndecisions. In other words, we are all in this together, \r\nboth in times of success and in times of failure.\r\nSome of the Council’s most damaging failures \r\nhave occurred in the face of atrocity crimes. Rwanda, \r\nSrebrenica and now Syria sadly stand out in that \r\nrespect. When we celebrate the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Organization later in October, we should clearly \r\nacknowledge the damage done, and we should commit \r\nourselves, therefore, to taking decisive action in the \r\nfuture when it is needed. To that end, Liechtenstein \r\nhas led the discussion in the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group, which has resulted in a Code \r\nof Conduct regarding Security Council action against \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes. That \r\nCode of Conduct is a voluntary political commitment \r\nthat any State can enter into.\r\n32/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nThe pledge is twofold. First, it is aimed at supporting \r\ntimely and decisive action in the Security Council and \r\nat ending or preventing mass atrocity crimes — in other \r\nwords, at being constructive. Secondly, it is aimed at \r\nnot opposing credible draft resolutions put forward for \r\nthe purpose of preventing such crimes — that is, at not \r\nbeing obstructive. Fifty-nine States have already made \r\nthat commitment. I hope that many more will be on the \r\nlist when we launch the Code of Conduct on 23 October, \r\nand I hope that that will give impetus to efforts aimed \r\nat finding agreement among the permanent members, \r\nwho have the right of veto, in pursuit of the objective of \r\npreventing mass atrocity crimes.\r\nPreventing mass atrocities is so important because \r\ntheir effects are irreversible. They have no remedy. How \r\ncan one possibly make compensation for the slaughter \r\nof civilians, the mass rape of women or the brutalizing \r\nof children? Our primary objective must be to prevent \r\nthose crimes from happening. That is a complex and \r\nlong-term task, involving all parts of the United Nations \r\nsystem, but when volatile situations move closer to \r\nescalation, preventive diplomacy remains one of the \r\nmost powerful tools at our disposal. Clearly, however, \r\nwe need to make much stronger investments in it, both \r\npolitically and financially.\r\nAs we consider how we can sharpen our tools for \r\nconflict prevention and resolution, one conclusion is \r\nalready clear. We must get better at including women \r\nand their perspectives in those processes. The fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the women and peace and security \r\nagenda, laid out in Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000), therefore marks a bittersweet moment. That \r\nagenda sets out a comprehensive vision for how to \r\ninclude women in peaceful solutions and how to protect \r\nthem from the effects of armed conflict. It is in itself \r\na remarkable achievement. Yet, we have, by and large, \r\nbeen unable to fulfil the promise made fifteen years ago. \r\nGirls born into a post-resolution 1325 (2000) world still \r\nsuffer from abuse, sexual violence, forced recruitment \r\nand displacement. Let us take decisive steps forward \r\nwhen we meet later this month in the Security Council.\r\nThese are turbulent times, not just for the United \r\nNations but also for an institution closely affiliated \r\nwith it, the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\nAs the first treaty-based international court with \r\njurisdiction over the worst crimes under international \r\nlaw, it is shouldering a massive responsibility. In just \r\nover ten years, the Court has established itself as the \r\nworld’s central player in the fight against impunity. \r\nIt is an independent judicial institution and therefore \r\ndoes not engage in political calculations. Quite often, \r\nhowever, it finds itself forced to navigate a politically \r\ncharged environment. We must, therefore, step up our \r\nsupport for the Court. More States should join the \r\nfamily of the current 123 parties to the Rome Statute. \r\nConsistent support should come from those who can, \r\nshould or must cooperate with the Court, including \r\nthe Security Council. We must also intensify and give \r\ngreater assistance to national efforts to investigate and \r\nprosecute.\r\nThe link between the ICC and the United Nations \r\nwill soon get stronger, thanks to the Kampala \r\nAmendments on the crime of aggression, which will \r\nenable the ICC to help enforce a core provision of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, namely, the prohibition \r\nagainst the use of force. The most serious forms of the \r\nillegal use of force are no longer merely breaches of \r\nthe Charter; they also entail criminal accountability \r\nfor those responsible for such acts. We are only a little \r\nover a year’s time and a handful of ratifications away \r\nfrom activating the Court’s jurisdiction over that crime. \r\nWe look forward to more States ratifying the Kampala \r\nconsensus. It will be a big step, both for international \r\ncriminal justice and for the United Nations.\r\nFinally, let me offer some thoughts on the \r\nunprecedented levels of the displacement of persons \r\nin the world, which is quickly turning into one of the \r\nbiggest challenges for the United Nations. Countries \r\nclose to the conflicts have been grappling with that \r\nissue for quite some time already. More recently, \r\nEurope has been impacted in ways that test the fabric \r\nof our region. Even though we are not a member of \r\nthe European Union, Liechtenstein feels strongly that \r\nEurope is not just a continent. It is also a symbol of \r\ncommon values and a promise to address challenges \r\ntogether, irrespective of our models of political and \r\neconomic integration. We therefore want to contribute \r\nto a sustainable solution based on international law and \r\nhuman rights. \r\nRegional approaches will remain key to such \r\nsolutions. But migration and refugee f lows are not \r\nsimply a regional phenomenon, and by far the largest \r\nshare of people who have left their homes are still in \r\ndeveloping countries. A truly global discussion is \r\ntherefore required, as well. The World Humanitarian \r\nSummit next year seems to offer a good and timely \r\nplatform.\r\n15-29816 33/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nWe are confronting daunting challenges, yet to lose \r\nhope is not an option. Therefore, in closing, I would \r\nlike to share with you the perspective of a man whom \r\nI greatly admire and who has extensively collaborated \r\nwith Liechtenstein. In 1944, he landed on the shores \r\nof Normandy, he participated in the liberation of the \r\nconcentration camps, and he led the prosecution in \r\nhistory’s biggest murder cases at the Nuremberg trials. \r\nHe is now 95 years old and continues to fight for law, not \r\nwar, as he has done all his life. His name is Benjamin \r\nFerencz, and he has three pieces of advice for all of us: \r\n“Never give up. Never give up. Never give up.”\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Wilfred Elrington, Attorney General and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Belize.\r\nMr. Elrington (Belize): Allow me at the outset \r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession and to assure you of Belize’s steadfast support \r\nand cooperation. I deem it both fortuitous and fitting \r\nthat I am accorded the privilege of addressing the \r\nAssembly on the occasion of the International Day of \r\nNon-Violence.\r\nThe theme of this session, “The United Nations at \r\n70: the road ahead to peace, security and human rights”, \r\nprovokes the question of whether the United Nations, \r\nas presently constituted, is up to the task of providing \r\nthe world community with the protection that it will \r\nso genuinely need in the coming years and expects to \r\nobtain. While the events that gave rise to the founding \r\nof the United Nations seventy years ago are in many \r\nrespects similar to some of the events we see today, it \r\ncan legitimately be argued that the world of 1945 was \r\nneither confronted with, nor could it contemplate a \r\nphenomenon as potentially intractable and catastrophic \r\nas climate change. Does it therefore follow that the \r\nUnited Nations is not imbued with the resilience to deal \r\nsatisfactorily or adequately with that most ominous and \r\ndreaded phenomenon?\r\nThanks to the information age and the attendant \r\ncommunication revolution, the ubiquitous media, \r\nboth mass and social, incessantly publish disquieting \r\nglobal events widely and instantaneously. The events \r\naccentuated by the media are, for the most part, those \r\nthat speak to the multifarious threats, misfortunes \r\nand disasters being experienced on a daily basis by \r\nhumankind. Those threats have their roots in human-\r\nmade causes. The accelerated phenomenon of climate \r\nchange — giving rise to the inexorable melting of the \r\nglaciers, the rising and warming of the oceans and \r\nseas, the spawning of super typhoons, hurricanes, \r\ntornadoes and f loods, droughts, desertification, and the \r\nindiscriminate igniting of conflagrations of gigantic \r\nproportions - is increasingly attributed to anthropogenic \r\ninterference with the climate system.\r\nThe senseless violence and excesses of terrorists, \r\nreligious extremists, rogue soldiers, police and security \r\npersonnel, human and drug traffickers, and regimes \r\nthat brutally, mercilessly and wantonly slaughter their \r\nown citizens and citizens of other countries who in \r\ntheir view pose a clear and present danger to them or to \r\ntheir vital interests — all these constitute human-made \r\nthreats to the world’s population.\r\nOf all those threats, however, the one that poses \r\nthe greatest existential threat to our entire planet and \r\nall living things thereon is climate change. Eminent \r\nscientists opine and predict that the damage that will \r\nbe done to the world’s marine life and ecosystems \r\ncaused by, for example, melting glaciers and rising sea \r\ntemperatures alone are incalculable and irremediable. \r\nThey predict that there will be a similar impact on \r\nthe world’s f lora and fauna and terrestrial ecosystems \r\nfrom large-scale and indiscriminate deforestation \r\nand desertification. One obvious consequence, \r\namong others, of such occurrences could be a severe \r\ncurtailment in the world’s vital food supply and the \r\nadvent of the spectre of massive starvation worldwide. \r\nSuch occurrences would unquestionably have a negative \r\nimpact on all of humanity, for we all inhabit the same \r\nplanet and share the same core needs, adequate food \r\nsupply being only one of them.\r\nEven as the United Nations endeavours to deal \r\nwith the dire consequences of climate change, it still \r\nmust dutifully serve the aspirations of our peoples \r\nto enhance their economic and social development. \r\nAlthough globally we can claim some success in poverty \r\neradication, the current unprecedented, desperate and \r\nperilous f light of hundreds of thousands of people from \r\nthe perennially impoverished South to more aff luent \r\nregions is irrefutable evidence of the most urgent need \r\nto do more for the poor and the powerless.\r\nIt is axiomatic that in times of deep personal \r\ncrisis, such as when someone is diagnosed with a \r\nterminal illness, one does not stop to count the cost \r\nof finding a cure. On the contrary, strenuous efforts \r\nare immediately initiated in search of one, even if that \r\n34/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nentails the exhaustion of one’s life savings. Given the \r\nclear and present existential threat posed by climate \r\nchange, it is imperative that that threat be treated with \r\nno less urgency and gravity than that with which a \r\ndiagnosis of a terminal illness is treated. And we must \r\ndo so in tandem with our ongoing quests to vest our \r\npeople with hope, opportunities and a chance for the \r\nfuture that they deserve.\r\nTo that end, our world community must be prepared \r\nto deploy whatever resources that may be required \r\nwithout counting the costs. It would be most unwise \r\nfor the wealthy nations — whose historic responsibility \r\nit is to furnish those necessary resources without this \r\nproof — to regard contributions made to meet these \r\nchallenges as simply an exercise in philanthropy or \r\naltruism. Nothing could be further from the truth. Such \r\ncontributions are vital investments in the survival of \r\nplanet Earth and of all living things therein.\r\nSome countries are evidently in greater and more \r\nimmediate danger than others from the effects of climate \r\nchange at this time. What is happening in the Bahamas \r\nas we speak and what happened in Dominica and in \r\nstill earlier in Vanuatu are constant and incontestable \r\nreminders of the particular vulnerability of small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) and low-lying coastal States, \r\nlike my own country, Belize. My Government expresses \r\nits deep solidarity with our fellow SIDS and assures the \r\nAssembly of our fullest support for them. Today, they \r\nare on the front lines; tomorrow it will be us. For no \r\ncountry will escape the devastating impacts of climate \r\nchange, which does not defer to size, borders or wealth, \r\nor lack thereof.\r\nThe lessons of history are salutary. The tragic \r\nsinking of the mighty Titanic reminds us that whereas \r\nthose passengers berthed in the lower decks were \r\nthe first to perish as that giant ship made its perilous \r\ndescent toward the dark depths of the Atlantic on that \r\nfateful day of 10 April 1912, ultimately all passengers \r\non that ill-fated ship who had not been rescued in life \r\nrafts perished by drowning, including those berthed \r\non the top-most deck. We cannot afford to forget for \r\none moment that all of us human beings are merely \r\npassengers on planet Earth, sailing ceaselessly in the \r\ncelestial firmament.\r\nBelize is ever mindful that our community of \r\nnations, not unlike the proverbial chain that is only \r\nas strong as its weakest link, is only as strong as the \r\nweakest of its members. Small and weak though they \r\nmay be, nations like my own form an integral part of \r\nhumankind’s food chain and security ecosystem. Any \r\nimpairment of that food chain or security ecosystem \r\npotentially imperils the security of humankind globally.\r\nIn its 70-year history, the United Nations has \r\nundeniably made notable inroads to combat climate \r\nchange and promote sustainable development. It has \r\ngalvanized attention to climate change and adopted a \r\nFramework Convention to fashion a global response to \r\nstabilize greenhouse gas emissions without jeopardizing \r\nglobal development. The United Nations has marshalled \r\nfinancial, scientific and technological support for \r\ncountries in need of it and, with the adoption of 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), \r\nsignaled a global transformation for planet, people and \r\nprosperity.\r\nBut the jury is still out on the United Nations record \r\nof achievements. Notwithstanding a global commitment \r\nto tackle climate change, our efforts have been less \r\nthan ambitious, and achieving a successor global \r\nemission reduction regime hangs in the balance, not \r\nleast because finance and technology are conspicuously \r\nwanting. Worse yet, the failure of the world’s Powers to \r\nagree to hold the global average temperature increase \r\nto well below 1.5°C relative to pre-industrial levels will \r\ncertainly condemn small island developing States and \r\nlow-lying coastal States.\r\nOur misses in peace and security are no less \r\ngrave, with the vulnerable paying the price of \r\npolitical expediency. Through our awesome power \r\nof communication the world is stricken with the \r\nunanswered cries of men, women and children suffering \r\nfrom indiscriminate acts perpetrated in Syria, Palestine, \r\nIsrael, Nigeria, Ukraine and beyond.\r\nThis condition brings me back to the question posed \r\nat the beginning of my statement regarding the capacity \r\nof the United Nations to address the most pressing global \r\nchallenges. Belize entertains no doubt that the power, \r\nwealth and knowledge that lie within the collective \r\nmembership of the United Nations make it capable of \r\nachieving stupendous feats. But we must first commit \r\nto working together and with all stakeholders — large \r\nand small, public and private. Unity is strength. The \r\nmight of the United Nations rests in its universality and \r\nthe endurable values enshrined in its Charter. Belize \r\nreadily shoulders its responsibilities as a member of \r\nthis community of nations.\r\nWe are committed to doing everything in our \r\npower that will promote the containment, if not the \r\n15-29816 35/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nreversal, of climate change. We have joined with our \r\nbrothers and sisters of the small island and low-lying \r\ndeveloping States in a pioneering initiative — the Small \r\nIsland Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative, \r\nwhich Belize proudly hosts — to foster our transition \r\nto low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. We also \r\ncommit to pushing for a robust and ambitious regime \r\nin Paris that will have all of us working in lockstep to \r\nstabilize greenhouse gas emissions and safeguard the \r\nplanet and the sustainable development of our people.\r\nLikewise, we stand ready to provide every support \r\nto United Nation initiatives that will bring the warring \r\nfactions in Syria, and in Israel and Palestine, to the \r\ntable to find peaceful solutions to their differences. \r\nWe are committed to combating terrorism, and we \r\nunreservedly condemn the atrocities perpetrated \r\nagainst women and girls in Nigeria by Boko Haram. We \r\nexpress our solidarity with the Nigerian Government \r\non its efforts to dismantle that criminal gang and bring \r\nits members to justice.\r\nBelize supports the ongoing initiatives to reform \r\nthe United Nations to make it more representative and \r\nbetter able to maintain peace and resolve conflicts. \r\nWe continue to call for the United Nations to engage \r\nwith Taiwan, whose 23 million people stand ready \r\nto contribute, especially through United Nations \r\nspecialized agencies, to resolving the world’s problems \r\nand who have every expectation that their interests \r\nshould be heard and represented.\r\nWe welcome the unanimous support for the Security \r\nCouncil decision to terminate seven resolutions that \r\ninflicted sanctions on Iran upon receipt by the Council \r\nof a report from the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency.\r\nBelize also welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States and \r\nCuba, and we urge the United States to now proceed \r\nexpeditiously to ending the very damaging embargo \r\nagainst Cuba and to return Guantanamo Bay to the \r\nCuban Government.\r\nWe call upon powerful arms-producing nations to \r\nrefrain from selling arms and weapons to those who \r\nuse them to oppress others, and to warlords in war-torn \r\ncountries.\r\nBelize has always taken peace, security and respect \r\nfor human rights very seriously. Our Constitution is \r\nmodelled on the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights, in which the protection of fundamental rights \r\nand freedoms is enshrined. The Belize Government \r\nassiduously respects the rule of law.\r\nBelize also endeavours to be a good global citizen. \r\nOur laws have evolved to reflect international norms \r\nand standards, covering areas from human rights to \r\nfinance, creating enabling environments that promote \r\nand protect the fundamental freedoms of our people, \r\nand fostering socially responsible investment in our \r\ncountry. Our National Assembly has recently enacted \r\na new and robust Banking Act and has improved \r\nregulations for our Ship Registry to bring them in line \r\nwith global efforts, including those of the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development, so as to \r\nenhance transparency and strengthen our legislative \r\nframework.\r\nOur Government has focused very heavily \r\non improving the lives of ordinary Belizeans. We \r\nare investing millions of dollars in improving \r\ninfrastructure countrywide, including the construction \r\nand refurbishment of schools, sporting facilities, \r\nhospitals and roads. We are investing heavily in road \r\nsafety to reduce injuries and deaths associated with \r\ntraffic accidents. Access to public health services has \r\nbeen expanded throughout the country. We have made \r\nit easier for Belizeans to access affordable credit by \r\nensuring an unprecedented reduction in interest rates \r\nthrough the establishment of our very own National \r\nBank of Belize. Unemployment has been significantly \r\nreduced, by 10 per cent, while at the same time we have \r\nbeen able to keep the inflation rate among the lowest in \r\nour region.\r\nBelize believes fervently in integration and in \r\npeaceful coexistence. To that end, we are also doing \r\nour part to ensure that peace and security prevail in \r\nour part of the world. Together with all Latin American \r\nand Caribbean countries, we have jointly designated \r\nour region as a zone of peace. Alongside the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, we stand in solidarity with our brothers \r\nand sisters in Haiti as they deal with the human \r\nrights impasse with their sister nation, the Dominican \r\nRepublic. We also stand in solidarity with our brothers \r\nand sisters in Guyana and Venezuela as they work \r\ntowards an amicable solution to their territorial dispute.\r\nEarlier this year, we signed a protocol to the Special \r\nAgreement between Belize and Guatemala, to submit \r\nGuatemala’s territorial insular and maritime claim to \r\nour country to the International Court of Justice. We \r\nexpect that will facilitate and speed up the process to \r\nfinally and definitively put an end to the unfounded \r\n36/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nclaims that have plagued us and our region for far too \r\nlong.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Clarice Modeste-Curwen, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Grenada.\r\nMs. Modeste-Curwen (Grenada): I am pleased to \r\nbring our usual warm greetings from the Government \r\nand the people of Grenada, on whose behalf I am \r\nprivileged to address this renowned institution and \r\ndistinguished gathering. I am also pleased to join \r\nesteemed colleagues who preceded me in thanking \r\nthe outgoing President of the General Assembly, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for his \r\nenergetic and focused leadership in the sixty-ninth \r\nsession. I commend that session for blazing a trail that \r\ngives us no choice but to follow as we strive to deliver \r\nand implement a transformative post-2015 development \r\nagenda.\r\nI also congratulate and thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his extraordinary leadership of the United \r\nNations and express our deep gratitude especially for \r\nthe keen interest he has shown in the developmental \r\nchallenges facing small island developing States (SIDS).\r\nTo the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, \r\nI wish to say: please be assured, Sir, of my delegation’s \r\nfullest cooperation and support as you embark on the \r\nroad ahead for peace, security and human rights.\r\nAs is the custom, our themes reflect the current state \r\nof international affairs, as indeed they must. It should be \r\nno surprise that matters of peace, security and human \r\nrights continue to feature in the international discourse. \r\nIndeed, without those fundamental pillars of an orderly \r\ninternational system it would be colossal waste of time \r\nto even start to think of improving the quality of the \r\nlives of our people. Therefore, at this historic juncture \r\nof the United Nations at 70, the President is accepting a \r\nnew commitment to action for transforming our world. \r\nInterestingly, recent history has shown us that without \r\npeace, security and human rights, development cannot \r\nbe sustained.\r\nThe impacts of climate change are already being \r\nfelt the world over, and without a successful, legally \r\nbinding agreement in Paris, we will see climate change \r\ncontinue unabated. We will see more f loods and \r\ndroughts, more hurricanes and cyclones, more hunger, \r\nmore insecurity, more troubled spots around the world \r\nand more economies in crisis. As leaders and as a \r\ncommunity of nations, we will take actions from today \r\nonwards that will dictate whether we bequeath to others \r\na world where peace, security and human rights can be \r\nassured, or a world where human tragedy and suffering \r\nbecome the norm.\r\nThe General Assembly has recognized the unique \r\nvulnerabilities of SIDS. Grenada endorses the Security \r\nCouncil’s initiative to discuss the challenges facing \r\nSIDS. We strongly urge the Council to give greater \r\nconsideration to the special circumstances of SIDS in \r\nrelation to both traditional and non-traditional security \r\nconcerns. Climate change is a critical issue, not only \r\nfor intellectual debate, but in its manifestation as a \r\nmajor, multidimensional security threat to small island \r\ndeveloping States. The foundation of our sustainable \r\ndevelopment platform is undermined by climate \r\nchange. The recent experience of our sister nation, the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, is ample evidence.\r\nLet us now commit, ahead of the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nParis, to adopting a new, legally binding global climate \r\nchange agreement that will hold the global temperature \r\nrise well below 2°C, or 1.5°C above pre-industrial \r\nlevels. A framework for climate change cannot wait. \r\nWe need immediate consensus on climate change, \r\nincluding financing.\r\nWe wish to place on record our gratitude to our \r\ninternational partners for their support in developing \r\nour capacity for climate change adaptation and \r\nmitigation in Grenada. We reaffirm our commitment \r\nto Agenda 21 and the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of \r\nAction (SAMOA) 2Pathway.\r\nGrenada strongly supports convening the Triennial \r\nOceans and Seas Global Conferences, for the duration \r\nof the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), to coincide with World Oceans Day, \r\nbeginning with the June 2017 Conference in Fiji. We \r\nfurther suggest that initiatives like the Small Island \r\nDeveloping States Sustainable Energy Initiative \r\nbe used as a global platform for Governments and \r\nrelevant stakeholders to ensure financing for the full \r\nimplementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14 \r\nand its targets.\r\nA little over two years ago, the Government \r\nof Grenada, with the support of the international \r\ncommunity, initiated a programme of fiscal adjustment \r\nand structural reforms to boost economic growth and \r\n15-29816 37/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\ncompetitiveness, restore fiscal and debt sustainability \r\nand strengthen the financial sector. We have made \r\nsignificant progress thus far, and our achievements \r\nhave been documented in published reports of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and others. The success \r\nof the programme derived from a social compact \r\ninitiated by government to include our churches, \r\nnon-governmental organizations, trade unions, the \r\nprivate sector and political parties.\r\nWe now call upon the international community \r\nto make good on its unkept promises of 0.7 per cent \r\nofficial development assistance, notwithstanding that \r\n0.2 per cent goes to SIDS, such as Grenada. We urge \r\nthe international community to share in the sacrifice \r\nthat is required at this difficult period in our history. \r\nHowever, the unilateral graduation of many small island \r\ndeveloping States to middle-income status is premature \r\nand has resulted in significant budgetary shortfalls. \r\nI therefore reiterate the call for a more holistic and \r\ncomprehensive set of indicators for classifying States. \r\nThe point is that per capita income as a sole measure, \r\nwithout the context of climate vulnerability and other \r\ninherent structural challenges, does more harm than \r\ngood.\r\nWe must reaffirm that the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will depend on \r\nrevitalized and enhanced global partnerships. Together, \r\nGovernments, civil society, the private sector and the \r\nUnited Nations system must embrace all stakeholders, \r\nand we must get delivery on the commitments made \r\non the Samoa Pathway. Our people and our planet can \r\nrealize prosperity and peace only through reliable \r\npartnerships and frameworks, which are assured by \r\ntrust.\r\nSmall island developing States like Grenada — already \r\ndisadvantaged by small economies of scale, climate \r\nimpact caused mainly by developed countries, and \r\nhigh indebtedness — only seek a level playing field \r\nthat takes our disadvantages into account. However, we \r\nare disheartened by the fact that the same developed \r\npartners with whom we sit in our transparent \r\nintergovernmental engagement to find ways to develop \r\nour capacity revert to suspiciously blacklisting and \r\ndeclaring all jurisdictions to be harmful tax havens. We \r\ncall for developed countries to carefully weigh their \r\ninteractions with small and vulnerable island States \r\nto ensure that we are in no way unjustly victimized \r\neconomically and in reputation, especially when we \r\nhave worked assiduously to comply with stipulated \r\nrequirements.\r\nGrenada asserts that partnerships for sustainable \r\ndevelopment must be based on global solidarity, which \r\naffirms that none among Member States is more equal \r\nthan the others. Grenada seeks to safeguard the fiscal \r\nperformance achieved with the necessary support of \r\npartners and stakeholders.\r\nHistory dictates that we must embrace our grave \r\nresponsibility, daunting though it may be, to ensure a \r\npeaceful and sustainably developed planet for posterity. \r\nThe carnage being committed around the world as we \r\nspeak, demonstrated by the persistent disregard for \r\nhuman life, and the quest for dominance concealed by \r\nany faith cannot be condoned. The concept or definition \r\nof peace begs for global consensus. A peaceful world is \r\nnot just one without a world war. Authority and power \r\nmust mean caring, not killing.\r\nThe plight of displaced people driven from their \r\nhabitat — in extremely inhumane conditions, in search \r\nof peace and a better life, free of fear — is regrettable \r\nand warrants our collective and decisive action to \r\navert a wider and more destructive wave of migration. \r\nThe spectacle of drowning and dying people, lost \r\nand displaced children, the abuse of the weak and \r\nthe elderly and sexual violence against women are \r\ndisgraces to humankind. Their stories remind us of \r\nour interconnectedness as a global village and of our \r\ncommon humanity. In the words of the late Dr. Martin \r\nLuther King Jr., “Injustice anywhere is a threat to \r\njustice everywhere.”\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nGrenada condemns the atrocities and crimes against \r\nhumankind. Human dignity must be maintained in our \r\nworld as one vital element to ensure the future we want. \r\nOur cities and human settlements must remain inclusive \r\nand safe, resilient and sustainable. Therefore, Grenada \r\nappeals to all Member States to embrace SDG 11 and \r\nto promote dialogue and diplomacy in the resolution of \r\nconflicts. In that regard, Grenada applauds the progress \r\nmade in the recent rapprochement between Cuba and \r\nthe United States. Grenada sees this peaceful resolution \r\nthrough dialogue as an example to be emulated between \r\nand among all States where violence, conflicts and \r\ndisputes prevail. Nevertheless, Grenada joins in the \r\ncall for the total lifting of the commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed on the sister island of Cuba.\r\n38/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nGrenada supports objective assessments of the \r\nrole of the United Nations in the modern world so as to \r\nconsolidate its established knowledge-based authority \r\nand legitimacy as the premier global political forum. \r\nHowever, it is time to update our GPS. Maintaining \r\nthe status quo in the Security Council should not be an \r\noption. But the Security Council, as a pillar of global \r\nsecurity, must be carefully handled. In this regard, our \r\nOrganization should take stock of the contributions \r\nmade by all Member States to the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, bearing in mind that a strengthened \r\nCouncil will be better obtained and maintained through \r\nglobal consensus. Grenada also applauds the efforts to \r\nstrengthen the role of the General Assembly to ensure \r\nlasting peace, security and human rights.\r\nAmbitious though it may be, the agenda set for \r\nthe post-2015 era dictates that we must succeed. If \r\nwe have the courage to start, we have the capacity to \r\nsuccessfully implement the SDGs for our planet, for \r\nprosperity today and for posterity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Jean-Claude Gakosso, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Cooperation of the Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Gakosso (Congo) (spoke in French): His \r\nExcellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Congo, has bestowed on me the great \r\nhonour of representing him at the Assembly. On his \r\nbehalf and on behalf of the delegation accompanying \r\nme, I would like to take this solemn opportunity to \r\nsincerely congratulate His Excellency Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. I also pay tribute \r\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba \r\nKutesa, for his leadership. I recognize Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon’s tireless commitment in \r\nguiding the affairs of the Organization, and I renew \r\nthe indestructible support of my country, the Republic \r\nof the Congo, for his constant efforts to bring about a \r\nworld characterized by peace, freedom, democracy and \r\ndevelopment for all.\r\nIn creating the United Nations, the founding fathers \r\ndid not intend just to preserve future generations from \r\nthe scourge of war, but also — and this is stated in the \r\nSan Francisco Charter — to promote social progress \r\nand better standards of life for the multitude.\r\nIn the past 70 years tremendous human progress, \r\nwith spectaculer scientific and technological advances in \r\nvarious areas, has opened up unexpected opportunities \r\nfor humankind. People everywhere have become \r\nthirsty for democracy and freedom. Many Bastilles \r\nhave been stormed and the walls of totalitarianism \r\nhave crumbled. There are many countries like mine \r\nthat, since the beginning of the 1960s, have been able \r\nto enjoy their inalienable right to self-determination, \r\nshrugging off the yoke of colonalism and joining \r\nthe large family of the free, right here in the concert \r\nof nations. The emergence of new Powers, a historic \r\ndevelopment of which we are privileged witnesses, has \r\nbirthed a multipolar world. Since then, international \r\ncooperation has experienced a tremendous expansion \r\nthrough activities in varied areas.\r\nOver the past 70 years, humankind has not \r\nexperienced tragedy on the scale of that of the Second \r\nWorld War. This long period of peace since 1945 — quite \r\nsimilar to that which began following the famous \r\nCongress of Vienna in 1815, two centuries ago, and \r\nwhich lasted until the start of the First World War — is \r\nowed largely to the United Nations, the Organization \r\nthat has often served as a catalyst and central forum for \r\nharmonizing the efforts of peaceloving nations. When \r\nwe draw up the balance sheet of the last 70 years, it can \r\nbe said that the United Nations has more than kept its \r\npromise and given proof, if proof were needed, of how \r\nmuch it is needed and how relevant it is to history.\r\nMy country, the Republic of the Congo, welcomes \r\nthe resumption of relations between Cuba and the \r\nUnited States. We believe that this easing of relations \r\nbetween the two countries goes in the direction of \r\nhistory. My country’s Government fervently hopes that \r\nthis courageous and thoughtful process will lead fairly \r\nquickly to the lifting of the economic embargo that has \r\nhad a stranglehold on the Cuban people for far too long. \r\nWe call on that generous humanism that the American \r\npeople have demonstrated in crucial periods of history, \r\nsuch as during the Second World War.\r\nMy country, the Republic of the Congo, welcomes \r\nthe recent conclusion of the Iranian nuclear agreement \r\nbecause it represents a further step towards a world \r\nfree of destructive arsenals, indeed towards a world of \r\npeace.\r\nAlong with this inarguable progress, we cannot \r\nignore the weaknesses that have often characterized the \r\nactions of our Organization and that sometimes have \r\nreduced its ability to influence the course of events. \r\nWe still have not managed to ward off the spectre of \r\nwar or all forms of armed conflict — conflicts often \r\nfuelled by non-State actors, by nebulous networks that \r\n15-29816 39/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nfeed terrorism, by widely dispersed small groups that \r\ntake religious proselytism to extremes, by reckless \r\ndrug cartels or by pirates of misery who plunder the \r\nwaterways.\r\nClimate change and its dangerous repercussions for \r\nthe environment, endemic poverty, migration crises, \r\ninequalities between States and within States, to stick \r\nwith iconic and contemporary examples, are today \r\nreal threats to the stability of States and world peace. \r\nCentral Africa, the region that I hail from, has not been \r\nspared by these plagues, in view of the attacks by the \r\nLord’s Resistance Army and the unspeakable atrocities \r\ncommitted in Nigeria, the Niger, Cameroon and \r\nChad by the sadly infamous sect called Boko Haram. \r\nGiven the gravity of this new genre of terrorist threat, \r\nthe States of the region have recognized the need to \r\noppose it with a common response, which is why we \r\nin the Economic Community of Central African States \r\nhave mobilized to fight that irredentist, terrorist and \r\nsectarian organization. To this worrying picture we \r\nmight add the ongoing tensions in Mali and South \r\nSudan, which continue despite the signing of several \r\npeace agreements.\r\nWith respect to the Central African Republic, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Denis Sassou Nguesso, as is well known, \r\nis steadfastly leading the international mediation in the \r\ncrisis that this brotherly country has been facing for \r\nmany years. The national reconciliation forum held in \r\nBangui in May resulted in findings that demonstrate \r\nthe willingness of Central Africans to turn the page \r\non the recurrent crises that have marked the history of \r\ntheir country.\r\nHowever, their legitimate aspiration for peace \r\nremains subject to the successful conclusion of \r\nthe electoral process, for which the support of the \r\ninternational community as a whole remains necessary if \r\nwe want to see that country achieve the transition, token \r\nof lasting stability, before 31 December. Unfortunately, \r\nthe painful events of recent days, which have been \r\npunctuated with unheard-of violence, could jeopardize \r\nall the efforts to help the country recover lasting peace \r\nand stability. The serious incidents that shook Bangui \r\nrecently and the recurrence of intercommunal violence \r\ncan only reinforce the widely shared impression that \r\nthe transition process as it stands today remains fragile. \r\nThat is why our commitment to that country is so highly \r\nsought after.\r\nIn this decisive phase of the transition process, \r\nPresident Denis Sassou Nguesso, international mediator \r\nof the crisis, is dedicated more deeply than ever to \r\nhis mission. With the support of all partners, he will \r\nspare no effort to meet the Central African Republic’s \r\ninnumerable challenges, almost all of which can be \r\ncharacterized as a high priority or an emergency.\r\nI would like to pay tribute to the international \r\ncommunity for the ongoing commitment of the \r\nInternational Contact Group, and also salute the tireless \r\nefforts of all the peacekeeping forces deployed in Central \r\nAfrican Republic since the beginning of the crisis, \r\nfirst in the framework of the African-led International \r\nSupport Mission in the Central African Republic, then \r\nunder the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, \r\nthen under Operation Sangaris, and finally under the \r\nEuropean Union-led peacekeeping force. At the same \r\ntime, I wish to salute the memory of all the brave \r\nsoldiers who have sacrificed their lives for the sake of \r\npeace and international solidarity.\r\nPeace and stability, both at the national and \r\ninternational levels, as we know well, cannot be \r\neffective without a minimum of economic development \r\nthat benefits the greatest number of people, especially \r\nin developing countries. As we celebrate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of our Organization, the adoption a few days \r\nago of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) is in all respects a decisive step in \r\nbuilding the brighter future we want for our planet, for \r\nour people, for posterity.\r\nBy establishing an effective strategy for funding \r\nand planning for sustainable development, the \r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda, adopted in July at the \r\nthird International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, puts us squarely on track for cooperation \r\nfor development for all. The Republic of the Congo \r\ncompletely aligns itself with this viewpoint and hopes \r\nto see significant progress in the implementation of that \r\ncomprehensive new programme.\r\nMy country is among those that have a national \r\nstrategy for sustainable development, which is an \r\nessential instrument for strategic planning. It is also \r\none of those countries where the practice of democracy \r\nis being consolidated and strengthened every day, in \r\nparticular through a continuous process of regular \r\ncitizen consultations between opposition and majority \r\nparties, with a view to peaceful elections.\r\nWith the peace and stability it enjoys, and aware that \r\nsport contributes to the promotion of education, health, \r\n40/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\ndevelopment and peace, our Government successfully \r\norganized, from 4 to 19 July 2015, the eleventh All-\r\nAfrica Games, of which our capital Brazzaville is the \r\nhistoric birthplace.\r\nAt the 2005 World Summit our senior leaders \r\nclearly expressed their decision to see the United \r\nNations reformed, starting with its spearhead, the \r\nSecurity Council. That decision demonstrates the \r\nsteadfast collective will to put our Organization in a \r\nnew historic perspective. We firmly believe that the \r\nUnited Nations vitally needs greater transparency, \r\njustice, equality and internal democracy, while strictly \r\nrespecting the sovereign equality the dignity of each \r\nState. By defining and adopting a common position in \r\nthe framework of the Ezulwini Consensus, Africa has \r\nclearly shown the way for the necessary reform that it \r\nresolutely calls for.\r\nThe Republic of the Congo here solemnly renews \r\nits commitment to the United Nations, in the footsteps \r\nof the founding fathers and in accordance with the \r\nPreamble of the Charter. On behalf of the Republic of the \r\nCongo, I exhort the community of nations gathered here \r\nto consolidate its efforts more than ever to definitively \r\nmake manifest the noble ideals of freedom and equality, \r\njustice and peace, solidarity among peoples and human \r\ngenerosity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Manuel Salvador dos Ramos, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and Communities of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tomé and Principe.\r\nMr. Dos Ramos (Sao Tomé and Principe) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nIt is my distinct honour and privilege to participate in \r\nthe proceedings of the General Assembly on behalf of \r\nand representing the Democratic Republic of Sao Tomé \r\nand Principe.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to respectfully \r\ncongratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session and to express our full support for \r\nhim throughout his term. May it be highly successful. \r\nHis election is a result of the recognition by the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations of his noble humanity, \r\nvast political experience and unblemished professional \r\nhistory.\r\nBefore we begin to address the various topics \r\nthat are of crucial importance as contributions to a \r\nbetter world, we must remember that this year marks \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of this Organization. That \r\nshould provide Member States with the opportunity to \r\ndeeply reflect on the road that has brought us this far \r\nand on the different reforms that must be introduced \r\nto make it more representative, legitimate, dynamic, \r\nefficient and inclusive and ever more responsive to the \r\nreality and challenges imposed by armed conflicts, \r\nclimate changes, migrant and refugee crises, economic \r\nderegulation, endemic diseases, poverty and hunger.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, we welcome the relevance \r\nof the themes of this session, which reflect the reality \r\nof our times. The post-2015 development agenda and \r\nthe proper framing and resolution of climate change \r\nissues will surely create a path towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment for developing countries, particularly on \r\nthe African continent.\r\nWe further wish to express our appreciation to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for the competent, \r\nself less and zealous manner in which he has led our \r\nOrganization. We also pay tribute to outgoing President \r\nSam Kutesa, who led our General Assembly with \r\ndedication and strength during the past 12 months.\r\nGathered at Headquarters from 25 to 27 September, \r\nworld leaders adopted the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (see resolution 70/1). The Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals proved to be a good catalyst to \r\nmobilize synergies and achieve progress in social \r\ndevelopment — the reduction of poverty, hunger and \r\ndisease; advances in maternal health; and access to \r\ndrinking water. During that period there were major \r\ngeopolitical and economic shifts. We believe that the \r\nmultidimensional nature of poverty and fragility has \r\nchanged. We hope that the development process in this \r\nnew phase may be more inclusive, qualitative and, as the \r\nname suggests, sustainable for all, with all regions of \r\nour planet taking ownership and making commitments.\r\nFor this purpose, Africa chose, as its path \r\ntowards economic and sustainable development, six \r\npillars that are important to mention here and with \r\nwhich Sao Tomé and Principe identifies: structural \r\neconomic transformation and inclusive growth; \r\nscience, technology and innovation; people-centred \r\ndevelopment; sustainable environment, natural \r\nresources and natural disaster management; peace and \r\nsecurity; and finances and partnerships.\r\nWe believe that in erecting those pillars Africa \r\nwill take significant and necessary steps to guide the \r\ncontinent towards fulfilling the legitimate aspirations \r\n15-29816 41/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nof its peoples, thereby ensuring ever greater integration, \r\nprosperity and peace, under African leadership, with \r\ntop priority given to the dignity and identity of our \r\nsons and daughters. That will enhance the capacity \r\nfor creativity, innovation and production and will have \r\nan immediate and direct impact on the economy and \r\nsustainable human development because it will be \r\nproperly sustained.\r\nOur country, Sao Tomé and Principe, believes in \r\nthe above and urges the United Nations to adapt its \r\nprogrammes to the specific realities of Africa, without \r\nlosing sight of the  continent’s accomplishments in \r\nachieving some of the eight Millennium Development \r\nGoals by some countries.\r\nUnfortunately, we continue to see persistent \r\nhotbeds of tension and the emergence of new ones with \r\nhumanitarian repercussions of alarming proportions \r\nthroughout the world. In Mali and the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, the efforts undertaken by \r\nregional organizations, the African Union and the \r\nUnited Nations have introduced some stability to \r\nthe conflict zones. These efforts must continue to be \r\ncoordinated and channelled in order to consolidate and \r\nreinforce the achievements.\r\nThe perennial issue of Western Sahara remains on \r\nthe international stage and therefore requires greater \r\nengagement from all of us in the search for a permanent \r\nsolution for that negotiation process, which has dragged \r\non and stagnated for some time. However, to the credit \r\nof the parties, armed conflict has not resumed. We \r\nappeal to them to return to the negotiations and find a \r\nmutually acceptable political solution.\r\nWe are heartened by the recent resolution of \r\nthe political situation in the Republic of Guinea-\r\nBissau, where a serious political crisis has been \r\novercome without recourse to violence and in strict \r\naccordance with the rule of law. That bears clear \r\ntestimony to the democratic maturity that our brothers \r\nand sisters have achieved.\r\nAs terrorism continues to be a central issue in \r\ninternational politics, and in light of renewed acts \r\nof terrorism throughout the world, we believe the \r\ninternational community must act in a coordinated \r\nmanner. Only then will we be able to fight this global \r\nscourge. We clearly and strongly condemn the repeated \r\nand hideous crimes that the Boko Haram group has \r\nbeen perpetrating in our neighbour, the sisterly nation \r\nof Nigeria.\r\nIn our opinion, nothing can justify the atrocities \r\nthat Boko Haram terrorists have committed, and we \r\ntake the opportunity in this privileged forum to reiterate \r\nour unequivocal condemnation of such practices, which \r\nare unacceptable in every way. We wish to express the \r\nunwavering support for and heartfelt solidarity of all \r\nSantomeans with our Nigerian brothers and sisters, \r\nand we congratulate the people and Government of \r\nNigeria on their successes in the fight against terrorism \r\nperpetrated by Boko Haram.\r\nUnfortunately, in the Middle East we continue to \r\nsee bloody conflicts and loss of lives with the ongoing \r\nhositlities between Israel and Palestine. Therefore we \r\nappeal again for a peaceful and negotiated solution \r\nthat upholds both the Palestinian people’s right to \r\nself-determination and the State of Israel’s right to \r\nexist, in accordance with the pertinent United Nations \r\nresolutions, with two free and sovereign States living \r\nby side in peace and cooperating fully for development.\r\nSimilarly, we cannot fail to comment on the \r\npersistence of the domestic conflict in Syria and its \r\ndisastrous consequences. We again appeal to the \r\ninternational community to make all efforts to achieve \r\na cessation of hostilities, thus opening the way for a \r\nfrank dialogue toward a political solution to re-establish \r\na lasting peace.\r\nHowever, the prevailing situation is an opportunity \r\nfor deeper reflection, in light of the migration crisis \r\nthat is centred on the Mediterranean as the main access \r\npoint to Europe. Indeed, the waves of people of all \r\nages who are reaching Europe from war zones are not \r\nmigrants. They are refugees. They are not evading \r\npoverty or hunger; they are literally running away \r\nfrom death. When a mother places a young child in a \r\nprecarious boat for a difficult journey across a rough \r\nsea, with criminals at the helm, she does so because she \r\nconsiders that to be safer than the terra firma that she \r\nleft behind. Therefore, we must seriously reflect on such \r\nepisodes and the lessons they teach us regarding the \r\nsigns of the new times, and draw our conclusions. We \r\nmust refrain from promoting or exporting democracy in \r\nan outsider’s meddling manner or, worse still, through \r\naggression and/or violence.\r\nWe believe that everybody will agree with us when we \r\naffirm that global security is vital to ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment for our countries, and that it should begin \r\nat the regional and local levels. Located on the Gulf of \r\nGuinea, where we have seen a fresh outbreak of acts of \r\nmaritime piracy, terrorism, drug trafficking, oil heists \r\n42/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nand other transnational organized crimes, São Tomé and \r\nPríncipe understands that the international community \r\nmust combine its efforts to stop such acts. Therefore, \r\nallow me to mention the various existing partnerships, \r\nboth bilateral and multilateral, and cooperation, among \r\nthe Economic Community of Central African States, \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States and \r\nthe Gulf of Guinea Commission in implementing the \r\nrecommendations of the Yaoundé Summit, which have \r\nmade significant progress possible in the relentless \r\nfight against this type of criminal organization in our \r\nregion.\r\nWith respect to the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange that will take place this year in Paris, São Tomé \r\nand Príncipe believes that it is imperative that we reach \r\na global agreement on climate change, as our country \r\nis already being affected by its nefarious effects, even \r\nthough we are not an active polluter. Our vulnerabilities \r\ninclude, for example, a reduction in rainfall and, as \r\na consequence, diminished f lows in our rivers, as \r\nwell as f loods and the gradual erosion of our coasts. \r\nThose warning signs are already causing concern with \r\nrespect to our country’s climate problems, and we have \r\nbeen combating them by stopping deforestation and \r\nprotecting our coastal areas.\r\nTherefore, we welcome the determination of \r\nGermany and France to reach a climate agreement that \r\nis ambitious, broad and binding on all parties and is \r\nin accordance with the general rules of international \r\nlaw, with the ultimate objective of limiting the \r\nincrease in the global temperature to 2°C at most, as \r\ncompared to pre-industrial levels. In our opinion, that \r\nconstitutes a responsibility shared among developing \r\nand developed countries. We hope that the agreement, \r\nonce reached, will enhance the international obligation \r\nof all signatory parties to make funds available for \r\nongoing scientific monitoring of climate issues and \r\nthe transfer of technology to developing countries as \r\na way of improving actions to achieve the Framework \r\nConvention’s goals.\r\nIn December 2014, São Tomé and Príncipe effusively \r\nwelcomed the announcement on the re-establishment \r\nof relations between the United States of America and \r\nCuba, and we joined the world in jubilation over the \r\nrecent opening of diplomatic missions in both capitals, \r\nwhich thus resumed full diplomatic relations. As \r\nwe did then, we express the wish that both countries \r\ncontinue to strengthen their relationship on the path \r\nof economic, social and cultural progress for the \r\nbenefit of their peoples and humanity in general. \r\nTo that end, one issue remains pending — the trade \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba. It made no sense in \r\nthe past, and it makes no sense now. For that reason, \r\nSão Tomé and Príncipe appeals again for the lifting of \r\nthe embargo, which would be a sign of a relationship \r\nwithout handicaps and would allow both countries to \r\ntake fair and equitable advantage of bilateral trade \r\nrelations, on an equal footing with other countries \r\naround the world.\r\nIn conclusion, we must acknowledge and welcome \r\nthe political progress achieved by both sides of the \r\nTaiwan Strait, with a clear reduction of tensions, \r\never greater openness and broad trade exchanges. \r\nIn addition, given Taiwan’s manifold potential, we \r\nrecommend that Taiwan participate in the United \r\nNations specialized agencies, as it already does in the \r\nWorld Health Organization.\r\nFinally, we reiterate our country’s readiness to \r\ncontinue participating in efforts to mobilize wills and \r\nsynergies to realize the fundamental principles and \r\nnoble objectives that guided the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ibrahim Ahmed Abd al-Aziz Ghandour, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the \r\nSudan.\r\nMr. Ghandour (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate the President on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventieth session. We trust that his expertise and \r\nefficiency will guide our deliberations in achieving the \r\ngoals to which we all aspire. I express my thanks and \r\nappreciation to his predecessor for his patient and clear-\r\nsighted manner in steering our deliberations. I also \r\nthank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his team \r\nfor their commendable efforts at the previous session to \r\nestablish peace and advance the development goals so \r\nthat all peoples can enjoy security and stability.\r\nI take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nPresident, Government and people of the State of \r\nPalestine on the raising of the Palestinian f lag at United \r\nNations Headquarters, and we call on the international \r\ncommunity to enable the Palestinian people to establish \r\ntheir free and independent State, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital.\r\n15-29816 43/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nOn behalf of the Government and people of the \r\nSudan, I convey to the Assembly the greetings of the \r\nPresident of the Republic, Field Marshall Omar Hassan \r\nA. Al-Bashir, and reiterate our intention to contribute \r\npositively to the success of this important session \r\nof the General Assembly, which coincides with the \r\ncelebration of the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations under the slogan “The United Nations at 70: the \r\nroad ahead for peace, security and human rights”.\r\nClearly, the agenda for our debate this year reflects \r\nthe concerns and aspirations of millions of people \r\naround the world for a better tomorrow and a brighter \r\nfuture, from surmounting crises caused by conflicts \r\nand hostilities in many hotspots around the world \r\nto the achievement of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) . For all those reasons, humankind has \r\ngreat hopes for our upcoming discussion based on the \r\nsolid foundation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), which we adopted last \r\nweek.\r\nThe Government of the Sudan paid close attention \r\nto the intergovernmental negotiations on the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, which culminated in the \r\ndocument adopted after lengthy negotiations. We \r\ntherefore welcome the adoption of the document, in \r\nwhose negotiations we participated. The Sudan has \r\nbegun to implement measures with a view to attaining \r\nthose Goals. The Agenda has been mainstreamed into \r\nour national and regional programmes. We want to \r\nbolster the complementary role of the United Nations, \r\nits country teams, relevant funds and agencies, whose \r\nrole in implementing those plans we commend.\r\nHowever, we reaffirm our resolve to ensure \r\nthat those Goals complement the process of peace, \r\nstability and growth in our country, despite the fact \r\nthat we remain subject to unilateral coercive economic \r\nsanctions that hinder our ambitions to achieve those \r\nnoble Goals. From this rostrum, we strongly reject the \r\ncoercive and unilateral sanctions imposed on certain \r\ncountries, as clearly and explicitly stated in the Agenda.\r\nIn the wake of signing and implementing the \r\nComprehensive Peace Agreement in 2005 and the \r\nsigning of the Doha Document for Peace in Darfur \r\nin 2011, the Sudan had great expectations that \r\nthe international community would give special \r\nconsideration to its overarching concerns and economic \r\nproblems, especially regarding the alleviation of the \r\ndebt burden that is a serious economic impediment. \r\nWith regard to resuming development aid, the Sudan \r\nalso anticipates treatment equal to that enjoyed by other \r\ncountries emerging from conflicts.\r\nHowever, to its utmost dismay, my country’s \r\nreward for achieving peace and stability and for all \r\nits sacrifices has been endless, politically motivated \r\npressure, sanctions, boycotts and unilateral and \r\ncoercive measures that lack any legal justification \r\nwhatsoever. To make matters even worse, obstacles \r\nhave been set up to bar the Sudan from benefiting from \r\ncertain constructive initiatives, such as the Heavily \r\nIndebted Poor Countries Initiative, also for purely \r\npolitical reasons unrelated to reality.\r\nDespite the unfavourable conditions created by the \r\nembargo and boycott that unfairly target our people, we \r\nhave made strenuous efforts to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and have given high priority to the \r\nelimination of poverty in its various manifestations \r\nand the mitigation of its effects. However, our gains in \r\nincreasing per capita income have been offset by the \r\nfallout from the independence of South Sudan, after \r\nwhich the optimal share of our oil revenues went to the \r\nf ledgling State, in addition to the negative effects of \r\nthe global economic crisis and the economic embargo.\r\nDespite those difficulties, we have achieved \r\nreasonable success in educational services. Enrolment \r\nrates in basic and secondary education have greatly \r\nincreased, as has the proportion of female students, \r\nref lecting our growing interest in female education \r\nfollowing the implementation of national incentive \r\npolicies and awareness programmes. The growth in \r\nthe proportion of female students coupled with a State \r\ngender policy have led to a marked increase in the \r\nfemale employment rates, which significantly exceed \r\nthose of men in some sectors, such as health care.\r\nWith regard to the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity, my Government is on track to consolidate \r\ndemocracy and good governance. As Member States \r\nmight have seen, the presidential and parliamentary \r\nelections conducted in the Sudan last April were \r\npeaceful, fair and transparent and were monitored by \r\na number of regional and international centres. The \r\npeople elected a President and members of Parliament \r\nand other legislative bodies throughout the country for \r\nthe first time in the history of modern Sudan since its \r\nindependence in 1956.\r\nWe recall the comprehensive national dialogue \r\ninitiative launched by the President of the Republic on \r\n27 January 2014, to which a total of 87 political parties \r\n44/45 15-29816\r\nA/70/PV.25 02/10/2015\r\nresponded positively. All agreed to meet and discuss \r\nissues pertaining to peace, the economy, the alleviation \r\nof poverty, unity, identity, foreign policy, civic rights \r\nand duties, human rights, freedoms and political \r\npractices.\r\nMember States might also have taken note of the \r\nadequate and effective safeguards guaranteed by the \r\nGovernment to the remnants of the armed rebel groups \r\nin a bid to secure their safe participation in the dialogue, \r\nwithout restriction or precondition. In that context, on \r\n21 September 2014 the President of the Republic issued \r\ntwo presidential decrees on the renewal of amnesty for \r\nall armed individuals and the extension of a unilateral \r\nmoratorium for an additional two months as an incentive \r\nto the armed groups and individuals to participate in \r\nthe comprehensive national dialogue process, which is \r\nopen to all.\r\nWith regard to safeguarding human rights, the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan has made commendable \r\nachievements in the past and has taken many steps \r\nto safeguard and protect those rights, including the \r\nadoption, more than one year ago, of a comprehensive \r\n10-year human rights development plan, which now \r\nrepresents a comprehensive strategy and course of \r\naction for all relevant ministries and State institutions.\r\nWith regard to the protection of women’s rights, \r\nespecially their right to participate in political life, \r\nthe aforementioned presidential and parliamentary \r\nelections bear witness to the inclusion of women, \r\nwhich proved to be critical at all stages to ensuring the \r\nsuccess of the elections. Women hold 30 per cent of all \r\nparliamentary seats.\r\nIn respect of cooperation with United Nations \r\nmechanisms and relevant envoys, the Government of the \r\nSudan maintains constant cooperation and coordination \r\nwith the Independent Expert on the situation of human \r\nrights in the Sudan and participates actively in the \r\nuniversal periodic review of the Human Rights Council \r\nin Geneva.\r\nIn the field of combating cross-border crime, the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan has signed several bilateral \r\nagreements with neighbouring countries, including \r\nLibya, Chad, the Central African Republic, South \r\nSudan and Ethiopia, with a view to tightening border \r\ncontrols, preventing trafficking in arms and stopping \r\nthe infiltration of organized crime, including trafficking \r\nin persons. In October 2014 my Government hosted \r\nand co-organized the Regional Conference on Human \r\nTrafficking and Smuggling in the Horn of Africa, and \r\nhas enacted a national law to combat trafficking in \r\nhuman beings, which entered into force last year.\r\nOur discussion on human rights brings us back \r\nto the issue of unilateral sanctions, in the context of \r\nwhich we would like to mention the study conducted \r\nby the Human Rights Council two years ago on the \r\nhuman rights implications of such sanctions. The study \r\nconcluded that innocent people, not Governments, are \r\nthe primary victims of sanctions regimes.\r\nThe Sudan has always been an active partner \r\nin international efforts to combat terrorism. At the \r\nnational level, we have made considerable progress in \r\nensuring that our laws and legislation fully comply with \r\ninternational law and the international instruments on \r\nterrorism to which the Sudan became a party more than \r\na decade ago. The Sudan adheres strictly to their norms \r\nand provisions.\r\nIn that connection, we categorically reject all \r\nattempts to politicize and circumvent the provisions \r\nof international law. I cite the relationship between \r\nthe Security Council and the International Criminal \r\nCourt, in respect of which experience has shown again \r\nand again that the scourge of politicization has turned \r\nthe Court into a tool for targeting African leaders in \r\nparticular. In that regard, members may have noted the \r\ndecisions adopted by the African Union, notably those \r\nadopted at its Summits in Sirte, Libya, and in Addis \r\nAbaba, which were subsequently endorsed at the most \r\nrecent Summit, in Johannesburg.\r\nOur world will not be healed in the absence of a \r\nfair, equitable and universally acceptable international \r\norder. However, it has been clear for decades that the \r\ncurrent international system can no longer cope with \r\nthe developments and major transformations occurring \r\nworldwide. It is therefore imperative that we embark \r\non an in-depth reform and reconsider agreements in \r\naccordance with the circumstances surrounding us \r\ntoday. Therefore, my country strongly calls for the \r\nexpeditious implementation of structural reform of the \r\nUnited Nations and the Security Council, in conformity \r\nwith the principle of fair and equitable representation of \r\nall countries.\r\nThe daunting challenges facing our world \r\ntoday require an overriding international will and \r\ndemonstrate the urgent need to do more to meet them. \r\nThat fact needs to be reiterated on the anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Charter of the United Natins. The \r\n15-29816 45/45\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.25\r\nUnited Nations system, and the Security Council in \r\nparticular, need reform that will ensure the African \r\ncontinent’s representation in the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent seats of the Council in a process free of \r\npoliticization, selectivity and double standards.\r\nIn that context, we note that the fight against \r\nimpunity is a noble goal, around which the international \r\ncommunity should converge in good faith. However, as \r\na rule, mixing justice and politicization is inconsistent \r\nwith the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and international law. It makes \r\nthe delivery of international justice a platform for \r\nachieving narrow political goals that have no relation \r\nwhatsoever to those noble objectives. In that context, \r\nmy delegation calls for strengthening and supporting \r\nregional mechanisms and enhancing preventive \r\ndiplomacy to address all conflicts and their root causes \r\nwithin the framework of fighting poverty and achieving \r\na fair balance in the field of international politics and \r\neconomics.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.10 p.m.\r\n"
