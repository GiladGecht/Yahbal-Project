My country \r\nwelcomes this ambitious agenda and believes that it \r\nwill transform the world over the next 15 years. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates is deeply worried by the \r\nupsurge of violence due to active extremist actions in \r\nmy region that undermines its stability. Terrorist crimes \r\nhave surged in an ugly manner unseen since the end of \r\nthe Second World War, committed by the Islamic State \r\nof Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Hezbullah, Al-Qaida and \r\nother groups that exploit religion for political purposes. \r\nWe condemn the brutal methods used by these groups \r\nin the name of Islam. They have no connection with the \r\ntolerant teachings of Islam, which calls for coexistence \r\nand tolerance.\r\nOur principled position, as we stand shoulder to \r\nshoulder with the people and Government of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, is based on our firm belief that the \r\nstability and prosperity of Egypt reinforces the stability \r\nof our region. The recent political and economic \r\nachievements of the Government of Egypt are major \r\nsteps towards its recovery and positively assist the \r\nrecovery and stability of the region and restore Egypt’s \r\npivotal and historic role in the region. We commend \r\nAl-Azhar University for its long-standing tradition in \r\nconfronting extremist ideologies, and the role of its \r\nscholars in renewing the religious discourse. We call \r\non the international community to provide Egypt with \r\nthe fullest support in its fight against extremism and \r\nterrorism.\r\nMy country’s is participating in the coalition \r\nsupporting the legitimate Government of Yemen in \r\nresponse to the request by the President of Yemen to \r\nprovide the necessary support to the Government \r\nand people of Yemen in confronting the Houthi coup, \r\nand combating other terrorist organizations such \r\nas Al-Qaida in the Arabian Peninsula and ISIL that \r\nhave exploited the chaotic and unstable conditions in \r\nYemen and increased their terrorist acts. We seek, with \r\nthe international community, to restore the political \r\nprocess in Yemen in accordance with the agreed \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.26\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n26th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 2 October 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nparameters, most importantly the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil initiative and its Implementation Mechanism. \r\nTo this end, it is important to ensure full compliance \r\nwith Security Council resolution 2216 (2015), which \r\nwas adopted after consultations with relevant States of \r\nthe region.\r\nThis process underscores the importance of \r\nimproving the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil by involving affected States and regional \r\norganizations in accordance with Chapter VIII of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, which will enhance \r\nthe effectiveness of the Organization and contribute \r\nsignificantly to improving the implementation of United \r\nNations resolutions and the prevention of conflicts. \r\nWe commend the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Yemen. We affirm our continued support \r\nfor the Arab coalition led by the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia and its commitment to enhancing the capacity \r\nof the Yemeni people to restore stability. We regard \r\nthe liberation of Aden from the Houthi rebels to be a \r\nmilitary and humanitarian victory, with Aden now the \r\nlogistical base for delivering vital humanitarian aid to \r\nthe Yemeni people.\r\nTo alleviate the humanitarian situation in Yemen, we \r\nhave provided assistance worth more than $200 million. \r\nWe will continue to work with the United Nations \r\nto deliver aid to meet the humanitarian emergency \r\nneeds of the neediest people. We believe that the full \r\ncontrol of Bab Al-Mandab by the coalition forces is yet \r\nanother military success in securing that vital sea lane. \r\nIt marks the end of the control of the rebels and their \r\nISIL supporters, while demonstrating their weakening \r\npresence in other strategic areas in Yemen.\r\nWe are deeply concerned regarding the ongoing \r\ntension and instability in Libya, which represent a major \r\nthreat to security and stability in the region. We stress \r\nthe need to lift the ban imposed on the capacities of \r\nthe elected Libyan Government to fight ISIL and other \r\nterrorist organizations and to respond to transboundary \r\nthreats.\r\nWe are increasingly concerned about the inability \r\nof the international community to reach a political \r\nsettlement of the Syrian crisis and put an end to the \r\nviolence and systematic mass atrocities committed by \r\nthe Syrian regime against its own people, which have \r\nresulted in the displacement of millions of Syrians and \r\nthe destruction of their properties. The crisis has also \r\nhad serious humanitarian consequences on affected \r\nneighbouring countries and created a political and \r\nsecurity vacuum exploited by terrorist organizations, \r\nespecially ISIL and the Al-Nusra Front. The Security \r\nCouncil must therefore fulfil its principal mandate and \r\nreach a consensus on a settlement of the Syrian crisis \r\nso asto ensure a political transition and the formation \r\nof a new Government incorporating all components of \r\nSyrian society. We also stress the importance of the \r\nongoing delivery of humanitarian aid to the Syrian \r\npeople by the international community.\r\nWe affirm our humanitarian commitment to \r\nsupporting the Syrian people and alleviating their \r\nsuffering. Since the beginning of the conflict, we \r\nhave received more than 100,000 Syrian nationals and \r\nextended humanitarian and development assistance \r\ntotalling more than $530 million. The Syrian and \r\nLibyan crises have demonstrated the heavy human and \r\npolitical toll that we are seeing every day, especially \r\nthrough the suffering of women and children in their \r\nmass exodus as they search for safe havens and safe \r\nlivelihoods, and the heavy price paid by refugees who \r\nhave lost their lives in tragic conditions. The barbaric \r\nacts of destruction committed by terrorist organizations \r\nagainst historical symbols and sites have also revealed \r\nthe considerable loss caused to our human and cultural \r\nheritage.\r\nAs it has done in Syria, ISIL has exploited the \r\nunstable conditions and sectarian practices to further \r\nhostilities and violence among the Iraqi factions \r\nand destroy Iraq’s historical and cultural heritage. \r\nTherefore, we continue to stand in solidarity with \r\nIraq and support international efforts to combat that \r\nterrorist organization. We also support the efforts of \r\nthe Iraqi Government to achieve peace and stability \r\nand end sectarian practices, and stress in this context \r\nthe importance of implementing reforms to ensure \r\ninclusiveness, fairness and equality for all segments \r\nand components of Iraqi society. For its part the United \r\nArab Emirates will continue to support humanitarian \r\naid programmes to help the people affected by conflict. \r\nIt has become evident that the salvation of our region \r\nlies in building inclusive nations free from sectarian \r\nor religious affiliations used by parties for political \r\npurposes and which have led to chaos and bloodshed. \r\nWe are fully aware of the consequences of failing \r\nto take firm measures to prevent extremist and \r\nterrorist organizations from pursuing their destructive \r\nendeavours, especially in the Horn of Africa, as we have \r\nseen done by exploiting those who do not share their \r\n15-29822 3/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nviews. We commend the efforts of the Government of \r\nSomalia and its efforts to fight Al-Shabaab. We urge \r\nthem to continue taking the necessary measures to \r\nrestore stability and peace and reiterate our support for \r\nsuch efforts to achieve that objective. Therefore, we \r\nstress the need to intensify and pool our efforts in order \r\nto combat the threats of these organizations wherever \r\nthey are, and to address the root causes of radical \r\nideologies before they turn into violent extremism.\r\nWe have been committed to supporting regional \r\nand international efforts, including those aimed at \r\ncombating ISIL. We have also contributed to hosting the \r\nHedayah Centre to assist the international community \r\nin building capacities and exchanging best practices to \r\ncounter all forms of extremism. We also host the Global \r\nForum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies with \r\na view to spreading a culture of tolerance and peace \r\nand promoting convergence between faiths. Recently, \r\nwith the assistance of the United States, we launched \r\nthe Sawab Centre in order to counter the social media \r\nmessaging of ISIL and to allow moderate voices to reach \r\nthe millions of people who reject terrorist practices and \r\nthe misleading conceptions promoted by Daesh and \r\nother terrorist groups.\r\nWe believe that the security and stability of the \r\nStates of the region depend on positive cooperation \r\namong its various agencies, which must adopt as their \r\nfundamental principle respect for sovereignty and \r\nnon-interference in internal affairs. With regard to the \r\nstatement made by the President of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran (see A/70/PV.13), we believe that Iran’s record \r\ndoes not qualify it to speak about the safety of the Hajj \r\npilgrims. We support the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia \r\nand reject all efforts aimed at interfering in its internal \r\naffairs.\r\nWe reject Iran’s continued occupation of the three \r\nUnited Arab Emirates islands of Greater Tunb, Lesser \r\nTunb and Abu Musa, and call on Iran to return these \r\nislands. All actions and measures carried out by the \r\nIranian authorities are contrary to international law and \r\nall norms and common values. We call on Iran to reach \r\na just settlement of this issue either through serious \r\ndirect negotiations between our two countries or by \r\nreferring the issue to the International Court of Justice.\r\nDespite all these challenges, the Palestinian issue \r\nremains at the core of conflict in our region, and one of \r\nthe main threats to its security and stability. Moreover, \r\nthe feelings of injustice and frustration resulting from \r\nthe continued Israeli occupation of the Palestinian \r\nterritories and the f lagrant human rights violations \r\ncommitted by the occupation forces provide extremist \r\ngroups with an opportunity to exploit these serious \r\nhumanitarian conditions and to spread their radical \r\nthinking and incite frustrated youth to implement their \r\ndestructive agenda.\r\nWe call on the international community to seize the \r\nopportunity of the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations to create effective international partnerships \r\nbuilt on solidarity and a genuine desire to develop our \r\ncountries and achieve security and prosperity for all.\r\nAddress by Mr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Indonesia.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Kalla (Indonesia): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the seventieth session \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nIt is a great honour for me to stand here and share \r\nIndonesia’s perspective on this year’s session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, under the timely theme “The United \r\nNations at 70: the road ahead for peace, security, and \r\nhuman rights”. On its seventieth anniversary the United \r\nNations has reached quite a ripe age, the same age as \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia this year. On this occasion I \r\nwish to highlight three points: the achievements of the \r\nUnited Nations in the past 70 years, current challenges, \r\nand the way forward.\r\nFirstly, the United Nation’s seventieth anniversary \r\nis a good moment to look back and reflect on its progress \r\nin realizing the ideals of its Charter. The seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations has been marked by \r\nthe adoption of the post-2015 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). I should like to take this opportunity to \r\nconvey my sincere appreciation to the United Nations \r\n4/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nSecretary-General for his leadership and steadfastness \r\nin the process.\r\nAnother success story of the United Nations is \r\ncertainly its peacekeeping operations which have \r\ncontributed to maintaining peace and security. Indeed, \r\nthe United Nations has been relatively successful \r\nin preventing and overcoming major global armed \r\nconflicts in the past 70 years. Currently, more \r\nthan 100,000 personnel are involved in 16 ongoing \r\npeacekeeping operations worldwide. Indonesia is proud \r\nto be the eleventh largest police and troop contributor \r\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations with more \r\nthan 2,700 personnel, and yet my country is prepared to \r\ncontribute more in future.\r\nMeanwhile, the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in 2006 has created a peer-based review \r\nmechanism which reflects the collective efforts among \r\nMember States to strengthen cooperation and dialogue \r\nin the promotion and protection of human rights.\r\nNotwithstanding the achievements of the United \r\nNations, we must not be complacent. Indeed, there are \r\nstill numerous challenges confronting us. As we speak \r\nthere are still numerous armed conflicts throughout \r\nthe world. The suffering of the Palestinian people is \r\nstill taking place, while the realization of a two-State \r\nsolution is still elusive. The recent conflict in Gaza has \r\ncaused more than 2,000 human casualties, displacing \r\nmore than 5,000 people.\r\nSectarian conflict, including the threat of the \r\nIslamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), continues to \r\nthreaten political stability and cause a multitude of \r\nhumanitarian crises in the Middle East, especially in \r\nSyria, Libya, Yemen and elsewhere. Not only have \r\nviolent conflicts torn countries and nations apart, but \r\nin Syria ISIS has also destroyed remnants of a great \r\nancient civilization that is our shared historical legacy.\r\nWe ask whether the United Nations has done \r\nenough when faced with these unfolding and recurrent \r\ntragedies? Radicalism, violent extremism and terrorism \r\ncontinue to pose serious global threats. Indonesia has \r\nconsistently played its role in addressing these threats, \r\nincluding their underlying root causes, among other \r\nways through interfaith and intercultural dialogue, in \r\nsharing best practices in counter-terrorism as well as \r\nstrengthening international cooperation. Indonesia \r\nhas also set a successful example in resolving conflict \r\nthrough dialogue and peaceful means. In August, we \r\ncommemorated the tenth anniversary of the signing \r\nof the Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding on \r\nAceh, which ended about 30 years of armed conflict. \r\nWe wish to recall, and once again appreciate, the \r\npositive contributions of the European Union and the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nthrough their monitoring missions.\r\nWe note with concern that little progress has been \r\nmade in the work of the United Nations Disarmament \r\nCommission. We still lack the necessary political will \r\nfor nuclear disarmament. Meanwhile, the small arms \r\nand light weapons trade, legal or otherwise, is still a \r\nmulti-billion dollar industry.\r\nWe are also witnessing the worst year for human \r\ndisplacement and irregular migration since the Second \r\nWorld War due to political crises, sectarian conflicts \r\nand other humanitarian crises globally. In the past \r\nweeks, we have seen a f lood of refugees f leeing from \r\nviolence in Syria — where well over 100,000 people \r\nhave been killed — to seek a safe haven in Europe, \r\ndespite the dangers and hardships they have to endure \r\non the way. We also ask: does the United Nations have \r\nsufficient political will to face these issues? \r\nMeanwhile, economic disparity, poverty and global \r\ninequality continue to haunt us. Even today, more than \r\n800 million people throughout the globe are suffering \r\nfrom severe undernourishment. The rich nations, \r\ncomprising a mere 20 per cent of the world’s population, \r\nconsume 70 per cent of the world’s resources. In many \r\nparts of the world, women, children, young people, \r\npersons with disabilities, the elderly and people living in \r\nconflict and emergency situations remain marginalized \r\nand untouched by the progress in development. Twenty \r\nyears after the first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties of the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, we have yet to produce a universal \r\nagreement on climate change.\r\nIn the context of trade, we have yet to see progress \r\nand concrete results from the Doha development \r\nagenda to support a rules-based, open and equitable \r\nmultilateral trading system. The recent Ebola outbreak \r\nhas strongly reminded us of the importance of building \r\na strong and resilient health system globally. There are \r\nmany other problems we are facing that also need to \r\nbe addressed, such as intolerance, youth unemployment \r\nand uncontrolled urbanization. All of these challenges \r\nare related to the lack of progress in United Nations \r\nreform. Therefore, let us join hands in overcoming \r\nthese challenges. Here, the role of regional institutions \r\n15-29822 5/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nsuch as ASEAN should be be further strengthened in \r\norder to complement the United Nations.\r\nWe must work together in realizing peace and \r\nprosperity for our peoples. We have to stop conflicts \r\nand eradicate global inequality. We have to stop \r\nthe spread of radicalism and violent extremism. We \r\nurgently need to realize United Nations reform. With its \r\ncurrent membership of 196 compared to 60 in 1950, the \r\nUnited Nations system has to be even more inclusive \r\nto better reflect current global geopolitical conditions. \r\nWith regard to Palestine, we must ensure the birth \r\nof a sovereign and independent Palestinian State.\r\nWe must ensure the realization of the SDGs in a \r\ntimely manner. We hope that the upcoming climate \r\nchange Conference in Paris will seal the long overdue \r\nagreement on climate, applicable to all countries, with \r\nthe aim of keeping global warming below 2°C.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to work more effectively \r\nthrough partnerships with regional mechanisms to \r\nbetter address national and regional challenges. In \r\nthis regard, ASEAN needs to be even more actively \r\nengaged in United Nations processes in seeking better \r\nsolutions for our global problems. And in narrowing \r\nglobal disparities, we should encourage and support \r\nthe strengthening of South-South cooperation. In this \r\ncontext, Indonesia will establish the Asian African \r\nCentre as a follow-up to the 2015 Asian African Summit \r\naimed at revitalizing the partnership between Asian \r\nand African countries to promote peace and prosperity.\r\nFinally, let me conclude by stating that the world \r\ntoday relies on the United Nations: to create world \r\norder and peace and equitable prosperity; to guarantee \r\nsecurity for the global community; and to fully \r\nimplement the principles of human rights as enshrined \r\nin the United Nations Charter. For that purpose the \r\nUnited Nations needs the support of each and every \r\nMember.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice President of the Republic of Indonesia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Albert del Rosario, Secretary of \r\nForeign Affairs of the Philippines.\r\nMr. Del Rosario (Philippines): On behalf of \r\nthe Philippine Government, I express our warmest \r\ncongratulations to the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. I assure him of the Philippines’ support of \r\nhis leadership in charting the course for an energized \r\nUnited Nations about to embark this historic year on an \r\nambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), our plan of action for our people, \r\nplanet and prosperity over the next 15 years.\r\nLet me also commend the President for choosing \r\na theme that echoes the fundamental elements that \r\nled to the creation of the United Nations. This theme \r\nis also at the core of Philippine President Benigno S. \r\nAquino III’s social contract with the Filipino people.\r\nIn 1945 when the United Nations Charter was signed \r\nin San Francisco, the 51 founding Members, including \r\nthe Philippines, envisaged a future of enduring peace, \r\nshared prosperity and a new era of collaboration. \r\nSeventy years later, we have created a meeting place \r\nof the world, an experiment in world governance, and a \r\nvenue where the universal values of equality, tolerance \r\nand human dignity prevail.\r\nThe United Nations has become a major forum \r\nof nations that guarantees the dignity and worth of \r\nevery person. It has evolved as the main platform of \r\nopportunities to fight ignorance, disease, poverty, \r\ninjustice and extremism. With all the successes and \r\nchallenges, praises and pitfalls, the United Nations \r\nhas not only demonstrated its resilience, but has also \r\naffirmed its continuing relevance against the backdrop \r\nof complex global issues and emerging regional threats \r\nto peace and security. ape\r\nToday, the Philippines renews its steadfast \r\ncommitment to the cause of peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment through key priority areas and national \r\npositions ranging from climate change and the rule \r\nof law, memberships in the Asia-Pacific Economic \r\nCooperation (APEC) Forum and the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations (ASEAN), disarmament \r\nand non-proliferation to women, peace and security, \r\nmigration and human trafficking, peacekeeping and \r\nUnited Nations reform.\r\n6/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nTwo years ago in this very forum (see A/68/PV.22), \r\nthe Philippines outlined the five pillars that form part \r\nof the building blocks for the new framework of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, as follows: \r\nfirst, poverty reduction and social inclusion; secondly, \r\nenvironment sustainability, climate change and disaster \r\nrisk management; thirdly, accountable, responsive and \r\nparticipatory governance; fourthly, a fair and stable \r\norder based on the rule of law; and fifthly, peace and \r\nsecurity. During the process of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations for the 2030 Agenda, these pillars have \r\nguided the Philippines in sharing its experiences in \r\npursuing inclusive growth, on some lessons learned \r\nin governance and on the continuing development \r\nand security challenges that we face as an emerging \r\neconomy.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the overall global development architecture need \r\nto emphasize strengthening the pillar of resilience. \r\nThe Philippines knows only too well the urgency of \r\nbuilding a climate-resilient economy, being one of the \r\nmost disaster-prone countries in the world and having \r\nexperienced, almost two years ago, the devastating \r\nimpact of super-typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon \r\nto have made landfall in recorded history.\r\nGiven the new normal of mega disasters, the \r\nPhilippines will continue to play an active role in tackling \r\nthe issues of climate change, resiliency and disaster \r\nrisk reduction and management. The Philippines is \r\nthe current President of the Climate Vulnerable Forum \r\nand will promote a meaningful outcome at the twenty-\r\nfirst session of the Conference of Parties of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change in \r\nParis. The international community must adopt a new, \r\nlegally binding climate agreement that is universal and \r\nequitable, that ensures a bright and low-carbon future \r\nfor the next generation, and that addresses the needs \r\nof vulnerable States and sectors, particularly the poor, \r\nwomen, migrants and indigenous peoples.\r\nOn disaster risk reduction and management, the \r\nPhilippines will be guided by the Sendai Framework for \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, which recognizes \r\nthat the State has the primary role in disaster risk \r\nreduction and management. That responsibility, \r\nhowever, should be shared with local Government, the \r\nprivate sector and other stakeholders. We will support \r\ninitiatives in the United Nations that will allow us to \r\nwork on the four priorities of understanding disaster \r\nrisk, strengthening risk governance to manage disaster \r\nrisk, investing in disaster risk reduction for resilience, \r\nand building back better.\r\nOn maritime disputes in the South China Sea, \r\nthe Philippines has long placed its faith in the rules \r\nand institutions that the international community has \r\ncreated to regulate relations among States. International \r\nlaw serves as the great equalizer among States, \r\nallowing small countries to stand on an equal footing \r\nwith wealthier, more powerful States. International law \r\nis the tie that binds the community of nations together. \r\nWithout it, the global order could fall into anarchy. \r\nThat is why the Philippines, under the administration \r\nof President Benigno S. Aquino III, has been a strong \r\nadvocate of the primacy of the rule of law. With the \r\ngrowing support of the international community in \r\npeacefully resolving disputes in the South China Sea, \r\nincluding through arbitration, the Philippines believes \r\nthat the final outcome of this arbitration process would \r\npave the way for a settlement of the maritime disputes.\r\nOn our dispute with China, a long-time partner and \r\nneighbour, we also hope that we will finally see actions \r\nthat are consistent with Beijing’s declarations so that \r\ngenuine efforts to lower tensions in the South China \r\nSea can succeed and the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\ncan be obtained.\r\nThis year, the Philippines plays host to APEC \r\n2015 under the theme: “Building inclusive economies, \r\nbuilding a better world”. As APEC Chair for the second \r\ntime since 1996, the Philippines seeks to mainstream \r\nand pursue the following priorities: investing in human \r\ncapital development; fostering small and medium \r\nenterprises’ participation in regional and global markets; \r\nbuilding sustainable and resilient communities; and \r\nenhancing the regional economic integration agenda. \r\nAPEC, both as a process and a platform, continues \r\nto positively contribute to the region’s economic \r\nenvironment by promoting legal certainty for trade and \r\ninvestment. APEC also complements global efforts to \r\naddress challenges to sustainable economic growth \r\nthrough the APEC Strategy for Strengthening Quality \r\nGrowth, which promotes synergy between APEC’s \r\nwork and the United Nations Sustainable Development \r\nGoals.\r\nWith respect to ASEAN, the 10 member States \r\nwill be integrating their economies by the end of this \r\nyear, realizing the vision of one ASEAN community. \r\nWe need to ensure that ASEAN and its member States, \r\npartners and secretariat remain fully engaged in the \r\n15-29822 7/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nUnited Nations system. Indeed, the partnership between \r\nASEAN and the United Nations has been beneficial \r\nto regional peace and stability. As we reaffirmed \r\nwhen ASEAN met with the Secretary-General last \r\nWednesday here in New York, we are confident of \r\nthe United Nations continued support for ASEAN \r\ncentrality and its pillars.\r\nDisarmament and non-proliferation have become \r\nmore compelling issues for the Philippines, given that \r\n10 per cent of our population live and work overseas, \r\nmany in hot spots in the Middle East and Africa. The \r\nPhilippines remains firm on its position in favour of \r\nthe total and complete elimination of nuclear weapons \r\nand all other weapons of mass destruction. We will \r\ncontinue to voice our concerns over the humanitarian \r\nconsequences of nuclear weapons. We reiterate the \r\nneed for the balanced and immediate implementation \r\nof the 64-point action plan adopted at the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which \r\nwas chaired by the Philippines, particularly for the \r\nestablishment of a Middle East zone free of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. We also look forward to the signing \r\nand ratification of the Protocol to the South-East Asia \r\nNuclear-Weapon-Free Zone by the five nuclear-weapon \r\nStates.\r\nOn conventional weapons, the Philippines will \r\nhelp sustain the positive momentum created by the \r\nArms Trade Treaty’s progress and continue to engage \r\nin discussions on small arms and light weapons and \r\nimprovised explosive devices, particularly as used by \r\narmed non-State actors.\r\nThe Philippines will continue on its path towards \r\nsuccessfully implementing the women and peace \r\nand security agenda by highlighting at this session \r\nthe important contributions of women in peace \r\nnegotiations and peacebuilding, and their roles in \r\nshaping the narratives of peace. We will maintain our \r\nactive role in calling for the continued implementation \r\nof the Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women, the Beijing Platform \r\nfor Action and the Sustainable Development Goals \r\non women, particularly Goal 5 on achieving gender \r\nequality and empowering all women and girls. Taken \r\ntogether, these instruments are powerful mechanisms \r\nfor realizing national and international commitments \r\nto advancing women’s roles as enablers of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn the negotiations on the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, the Philippines emphasized \r\nand will continue to highlight the positive contributions \r\nof migrants to sustainable development in countries of \r\norigin, transit and destination. We deeply appreciate \r\nthe United Nations recognition of the Philippines \r\nas a model of migration governance because of its \r\ncomprehensiveness in terms of managed deployment, \r\nsolid protection, diaspora engagement and reintegration. \r\nBoth the United Nations and the Philippines believe \r\nthat migration governance is really about giving \r\nmigrants a human face. The basic perspective of the \r\nPhilippine migration management policy focuses on \r\ntwo important considerations: first, migration must \r\nbe a shared international responsibility; and secondly, \r\nmigrants’ human rights must be fully respected in all \r\ncircumstances.\r\nThe Philippines will also continue to play an active \r\nrole on the issue of human trafficking, either as a main or \r\nco-sponsor of resolutions that recognize the heightened \r\nvulnerability to trafficking of women and girls in \r\nhumanitarian crisis situations and other emergency \r\nenvironments. The Philippines will work with other \r\nGovernments to intensify efforts for the speedy \r\ndisposition of trafficking cases and strengthening of \r\nanti-trafficking mechanisms.\r\nSince 1963, the Philippines has been a consistent \r\ntroop contributor to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. We are committed to and have answered \r\nthe call of the United Nations for the deployment of \r\nfemale peacekeepers. I am pleased to announce that \r\nthere are now 15 Filipino women out of the 161 Filipino \r\npeacekeepers in the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti. Guided by the policy recommendations \r\nof the Philippine National Council for United Nations \r\nPeace Operations, we will continue to engage with \r\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations in the \r\ndeployment of Filipino peacekeepers and support the \r\nrecommendations of the United Nations High-level \r\nIndependent Panel on Peace Operations to improve the \r\nsafety and security of our peacekeepers.\r\nAt this seventieth session of the General Assembly, \r\nthe argument for United Nations reform is now more \r\nurgent than ever. The Philippines will continue to \r\npush for meaningful discussions on enhancing the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly, as well as on \r\nproposals to rationalize the agenda of the Assembly and \r\nits main committees. The Philippines will support calls \r\nfor continuing the conversations on the much-needed \r\n8/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nand long-overdue reforms to make the Security Council \r\nmore democratic, more inclusive, more transparent \r\nand more accountable. These reforms include urging \r\nthe Council to provide the General Assembly a \r\nplural number of candidates, especially women, for \r\nappointment to the post of Secretary-General, with due \r\nregard to regional rotation and gender equality. Together \r\nwith other developing countries, the Philippines shares \r\nthe position that a sufficient budget is important for the \r\nOrganization to deliver on its mandates and missions \r\nmore effectively and with greater accountability.\r\nIn conclusion, at the fourth session of the General \r\nAssembly on 20 September 1949, the late great \r\nPhilippine statesman, General Carlos P. Romulo, who \r\nwas just then elected President of the General Assembly, \r\nsaid that the goal of the United Nations\r\n“defined by its Charter, was to make it possible for \r\nmen to live better lives in larger freedom under \r\na reign of peace founded on justice and universal \r\nrespect for law” (220th plenary meeting, para. 19).\r\nThose words now bear greater resonance. Today, I \r\nhave the honour and privilege of leading the Philippine \r\ndelegation, and on behalf of President Benigno S. \r\nAquino III and the Filipino people, please allow me to \r\nconvey these solid commitments of the Philippines. \r\nFirst, as we prepare the way for our future \r\ngenerations the Philippines will continue to advocate \r\nfor three key priorities and these would be: eradicating \r\npoverty; preventing conflict; and promoting the rule of \r\nlaw. Secondly, as we reaffirm our faith in the wisdom \r\nof the United Nations founding Members, we renew \r\nour commitment to ending the scourge of war, uphold \r\njustice and human rights and maintain international \r\npeace and security. Thirdly, as we all pursue the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, let the United \r\nNations continue to serve as the institutional platform, \r\nthe historical foundation and the moral edifice upon \r\nwhich we manifest humanity’s collective dreams, ideals \r\nand aspirations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Arnold Nicholson, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Jamaica.\r\nMr. Nicholson (Jamaica): It is an honour for me to \r\naddress this historic seventieth session of the General \r\nAssembly. I extend to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft my sincere \r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the \r\nAssembly. We feel confident that under his capable \r\nguidance, this session will inspire what he has called for \r\nin this seventieth year — a new commitment to action \r\nfor international cooperation towards peace, security, \r\nhuman rights and economic justice for all persons.\r\nI also express Jamaica’s profound gratitude to the \r\noutgoing President, His Excellency Sam Kutesa of \r\nUganda, for his outstanding stewardship during what \r\nhas been a truly defining year for the United Nations.\r\nAs we mark the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nfounding of the Organization, let us reflect on its value \r\nand work over the decades. We concede that the United \r\nNations is by no means perfect. Yet we shudder to \r\ncontemplate the kind of world that would have emerged \r\nfrom the ravages of the Second World War without \r\nits existence. We recognize the commendable role \r\nplayed by the United Nations in various fields, from \r\npeacekeeping, human development and the protection \r\nof human rights, to the codification of international law \r\nand environmental sustainability. We also value and \r\ncommend the work of the specialized agencies for their \r\nimpressive achievements in agriculture, population \r\nstudies, labour, industrial development, health and \r\nculture, among many other areas of pursuit. It is a \r\nrecord of which the international community can be \r\njustly proud. \r\nAt the same time, we acknowledge that the overall \r\nresults have been mixed as we have fallen short of \r\nour expectations in some key areas. Today, our world \r\ncontinues to be plagued by poverty and strife, which \r\nplace too many people in vulnerable situations. \r\nSuffering and inequality remain widespread and too \r\nmany are marginalized and left behind. To tackle these \r\nchallenges we must heed the call to do more and to do \r\nbetter. This is an historic moment and we must use it \r\nto muster our collective will to imbue this seventieth \r\nsession with a firm determination to make the eighth \r\ndecade in the life of our Organization a period of \r\nunparalleled achievement. Let us prioritize action over \r\nrhetoric.\r\nLast week, we adopted the most comprehensive, \r\nuniversal global 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) the world has yet seen. \r\nWe have great expectations of the 2030 Agenda, but \r\nthey will not be met without determined effort, the \r\nexercise of political will and the forging of genuine and \r\ndurable partnerships between and among all States. \r\nWe must also marshal the resources required at the \r\n15-29822 9/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nnational, regional and international levels to increase \r\nthe likelihood of success.\r\nThe challenge posed by climate change is \r\nan existential one for the peoples of small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS), whose lives and livelihoods \r\ntoo often hang in the balance. We therefore look for \r\nthe continued support of the international community \r\nfor SIDS. A key part of our work will be to ensure \r\nthat, as we implement the new development paradigm, \r\nwe fully address the unique vulnerabilities of SIDS, \r\nand the persistent economic and social challenges of \r\ncountries in special situations, such as middle income \r\ncountries. This must include the adoption of approaches \r\nto measuring development that reflects the realities of \r\nour countries.\r\nIn yet another reminder of the devastating and \r\ndisproportionate impact of natural disasters on SIDS, \r\nour sister island of Dominica is currently struggling to \r\nrecover from the ravages of tropical storm Erika. Jamaica \r\njoins the appeal to the international community to rally \r\nin support of the people of Dominica by assisting in the \r\nrecovery, reconstruction and humanitarian efforts that \r\nare required. It is an unfortunate fact that such events \r\nwill certainly occur again. In fact, another member \r\nof our Caribbean family, the Bahamas, is now being \r\npummelled by Hurricane Joaquin. In spite of this fact, \r\nhowever, the international community can ensure the \r\nimpact of the next natural disaster on our small island \r\nand low-lying coastal countries is lessened by helping \r\nus to improve our resilience in the face of these ever \r\nincreasing calamities.\r\nWe firmly believe that the successes recorded by \r\nthe Organization over the past years have reinforced \r\nthe value of multilateralism as the best framework for \r\ntackling global problems. The adoption of the SIDS \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action Pathway and the \r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda are recent examples of \r\nour commitment to collective action. The next major \r\nstep for multilateralism will come in a few weeks when \r\nwe hope to conclude negotiations in Paris on a global \r\nagreement on climate change. We must capitalize on the \r\nmomentum that we have generated throughout this year \r\nand work in concert to make the climate Conference a \r\nsuccess for us all. The sustainability of our planet and \r\nthe prosperity of our peoples depend on a meaningful \r\noutcome. We can and we must deliver for present and \r\nfuture generations.\r\nOur deep concern about climate change underscores \r\nthe urgent need to protect our oceans and seas. As host \r\nof the International Seabed Authority, Jamaica views \r\nwith considerable interest developments that impact \r\nthe preservation and sustainable use of the resources \r\nof the ocean for the benefit of mankind. We urge \r\ngreater vigilance by all. Let us prioritize sustainable \r\ndevelopment over short-term goals.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nremains a most urgent and demanding objective of this \r\nbody. While we have avoided a war of global scale over \r\nthe past 70 years, today we face increasingly complex, \r\ninterconnected threats to our peace and security. \r\nIntra-State conflicts and terrorist activities have \r\ntransformed the geopolitical landscape and increased \r\nthe threats to international peace and security. In his \r\nannual report the Secretary-General (A/70/1), points \r\nto some alarming developments in which millions of \r\npeople are engulfed by conflict and crisis, most notably \r\nin the Middle East and North Africa. Millions suffer the \r\nbrutal tactics of violent extremists such as the Islamic \r\nState of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), Boko Haram and \r\nAl-Shabaab. \r\nTransnational organized crime and the presence \r\nof weapons of mass destruction continue to threaten \r\ninternational peace and security, while the proliferation \r\nof conventional arms in the hands of non-State actors \r\npose a grave risk to many countries and regions. In \r\nthe face of these crises, our peoples look to the United \r\nNations to find solutions to end human suffering. Yet, \r\nthe Organization has been impotent to respond in many \r\nof these situations, calling its credibility and relevance \r\ninto question.\r\nWe must admit that traditional peace and security \r\nresponses have to date proven grossly inadequate \r\nin the face of today’s diverse conflicts. With that in \r\nmind, Jamaica welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\ntimely initiative to review and assess the peacekeeping \r\narchitecture undertaken by the eminent United Nations \r\nHigh-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations. \r\nWe commend the resultant comprehensive agenda and \r\nrobust action plan set out by the Secretary-General. As \r\na proud police-contributing country, Jamaica is keen to \r\nparticipate in the forthcoming discussions within the \r\nGeneral Assembly and in sharing the lessons learned \r\nand the ways we might use our enhanced understanding \r\nof the new contexts in which our peacekeepers are \r\nbeing deployed.\r\n10/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nWe, the United Nations, must redouble our efforts \r\nto find new avenues for maintaining peace and security, \r\nthrough preventative approaches and the creation of \r\ndurable solutions. Forging effective partnerships will \r\nbe the key. History has shown us time and again that \r\nwhen the United Nations works with other actors within \r\nthe international community, we can produce effective \r\nand enduring solutions to seemingly intractable \r\nchallenges. As we move to decisively address threats \r\nto and breaches of international peace and security, I \r\ncall on the Security Council to act more decisively to \r\naddress these challenges. Let us prioritize peace over \r\npolitical expedience.\r\nHowever, the Assembly continues to grapple \r\nwith the urgent question of Security Council reform. \r\nFortunately, the consensus decision of the sixty-ninth \r\nsession is a call for the commencement of substantive, \r\ntext-based negotiation during this historic seventieth \r\nsession. That is a significant step forward and Jamaica \r\nis honoured to have made its contribution as Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations during the past \r\nsession.\r\nJamaica is well aware that in our region, as \r\nelsewhere, peace and development are inextricably \r\nlinked. However, they can fall prey to rising social \r\nand political tensions, which too often culminate in \r\nconflicts. For that reason we are pleased that on the \r\noccasion of the second Summit of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States held in Cuba in \r\n2014, our Community proclaimed Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean as a zone of peace.\r\nJamaica recognizes that it is through dialogue and \r\nmutual respect that we can begin to address many long-\r\nstanding conflicts. We are therefore heartened to see \r\nthe warming of relations between two of our closest \r\nneighbours and call on the United States Administration \r\nto take a further bold step by immediately lifting the \r\nunjust economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. The Group has further noted and \r\nwelcomed the efforts of the Secretary-General to \r\nfacilitate a solution to the controversy between the \r\ntwo countries. The importance of keeping diplomatic \r\nchannels open and engaging in dialogue was reiterated. \r\nJamaica remains concerned about the ongoing \r\nborder controversy between Guyana and Venezuela. \r\nWe therefore welcome the recent decision of our two \r\nneighbours to resume diplomatic dialogue with a view \r\nto bringing the controversy to an early end.\r\nThe conflict-fuelled humanitarian crises unfolding \r\nthroughout the world, particularly in the Middle East, \r\nNorth Africa, the Mediterranean, and into Central \r\nEurope, require our urgent attention. So too do the \r\nhumanitarian crises that impact people living in areas \r\nprone to natural disasters.\r\nIt is unthinkable that we should tolerate the \r\nimmense suffering of millions, including vulnerable \r\nwomen and children. Let us be our brothers’ keeper and \r\nreach out in the universal and timeless spirit of “one \r\nlove” so poignantly championed by Jamaica’s musical \r\nicon, the late Bob Marley. It is Jamaica’s hope that \r\nthe World Humanitarian Summit in 2016 will signal a \r\nturning point in how we, the global community, treat \r\nwith such crises in order to contain and reverse their \r\neffects, and where possible prevent their occurrence.\r\nI now turn to the area of disarmament and arms \r\ncontrol, which is in danger of becoming a neglected \r\nand forgotten goal of the United Nations. Sadly, the \r\ndisarmament machinery has been languishing in a state \r\nof paralysis for the past 19 years. The vast expenditures \r\non weapons and military equipment of all kinds, which \r\nconsume a massive share of the world’s resources, could \r\nbe more properly channelled into the development \r\nagenda that we have just adopted. By so doing, the \r\nworld would not only be more prosperous, it would also \r\nbe much safer and more secure.\r\nWe are disheartened that the international \r\ncommunity has failed to seize the opportunity provided \r\nby the 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons to \r\nmake significant progress on its commitment to ridding \r\nthe world of nuclear weapons. We must invigorate our \r\ndisarmament efforts through new and more effective \r\napproaches. Jamaica therefore supports efforts to \r\naddress the humanitarian impact of nuclear weapons \r\nand joins the strong call for the negotiation of a legally \r\nbinding instrument to prohibit their use, which is \r\nembodied in the recent humanitarian pledge endorsed \r\nby 114 States.\r\nOf immediate concern to Jamaica is the proliferation \r\nof firearms of every description that endanger the \r\nlives of ordinary citizens, undermines the rule of law, \r\nthreatens economic and social stability and fuels violent \r\ncrime. Those who manufacture such weapons must \r\nexercise greater controls and support anti-proliferation \r\nefforts. The Arms Trade Treaty, which entered into \r\nforce less than a year ago, can make a significant \r\n15-29822 11/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\ncontribution to such efforts. We are therefore pleased \r\nthat the recent convening of the first Conference of \r\nStates Parties has laid the foundation for the full and \r\neffective implementation of the Treaty. Let us prioritize \r\nvision over short-term gain.\r\nThe promotion of human rights is a major pillar on \r\nwhich the United Nations was founded. We must remain \r\nresolute in our commitment to the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights, knowing that every human \r\nbeing is equal in value and dignity and endowed with \r\ninalienable rights. In too many circumstances, the rights \r\nof the most vulnerable are treated with scant regard. \r\nChildren are often exposed to a climate of violence and \r\nface persistent abuse; they are exploited and trafficked; \r\nused as labour and denied their fundamental rights. \r\nWe must continue to take stronger action to protect our \r\nchildren and to safeguard their rights.\r\nPersons with disabilities also face disproportionate \r\nhardships that hinder their ability to contribute \r\neffectively to their communities and societies. Jamaica is \r\npleased to have recently passed its landmark Disabilities \r\nAct, which seeks to ensure that we fulfil our obligations \r\nto meet the needs and development aspirations of this \r\nimportant community. Across the world, we ought to \r\nmake greater efforts to promote and protect the rights \r\nof persons with disabilities. We therefore welcome the \r\nhigher number of ratifications of the Convention on the \r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities over the past year. \r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nToo many women continue to face gross violations \r\nof their human rights. Too many are victims of \r\ntrafficking, violence and discrimination, of unequal \r\ntreatment before the law, and of subjugation and \r\ndomination. I applaud the active efforts of UN-Women \r\nto realize women’s human rights. Jamaica is proud of \r\nits long-standing social legislation and its record of \r\nchampioning the rights of women, even as we recognize \r\nthat more remains to be done, in keeping with the \r\nBeijing Declaration and Platform for Action.\r\nRacism, xenophobia and other forms of racial \r\nintolerance must also be rooted out in order to help \r\ncreate a more level playing field for all peoples. The \r\nlaunch of the International Decade for People of African \r\nDescent last December was a welcome development in \r\nour collective efforts to address these issues. In this \r\nregard, I call upon Member States to ensure the full \r\nimplementation of its programme of activities.\r\nOn the grounds of the United Nations now stands \r\nThe Ark of Return, a monument erected in honour \r\nof the victims of slavery and the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade. Jamaica and its Caribbean Community partners \r\nin tandem with the African Union spearheaded this \r\ninitiative with the generous support of the membership. \r\nFor those who may not have had an opportunity to \r\nview it, I would urge you all to spend what will prove \r\nto be a worthwhile few moments of reflection at this \r\nmemorial. It is our collective responsibility to ensure \r\nthat the message of the memorial, that there is no \r\nplace for racial discrimination in our world, continues \r\nto be passed on from generation to generation. Let us \r\nprioritize people over power.\r\nIn this seventieth year, let us reaffirm our commitment \r\nto the guiding principles of this Organization and place \r\nthem firmly at the core of our efforts to attain our shared \r\ngoals and objectives: sovereign equality of States, great \r\nand small; observance of fundamental human rights; \r\nthe equal rights of men and women; respect for the \r\nrule of law and the Charter of the United Nations; the \r\npromotion of social progress and better standards of \r\nlife for everyone; and a firm belief that diplomacy, not \r\nforce, should be our recourse in the quest to resolve \r\nconflicts and advance development. Let us therefore \r\nprioritize our commitment to action, with renewed \r\nfervour and determination. In this noble endeavour I \r\npledge Jamaica’s unwavering support and action.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His Excellency \r\nMr. Wunna Maung Lwin, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of the Union of Myanmar.\r\nMr. Lwin (Myanmar): First of all, I should like \r\nto join previous speakers in congratulating you, Sir, \r\non your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. I am confident that \r\nyour able leadership and diplomatic skills will steer our \r\ndeliberations to a successful conclusion. I assure you of \r\nmy delegation’s full support and cooperation.\r\nI should also like to commend the outstanding work \r\nof your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kahamba \r\nKutesa, at the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations. This historic occasion affords \r\nus the opportunity to reflect on and look back at the \r\nachievements of the world Organization. The United \r\nNations was founded to safeguard international peace \r\nand security in order to save succeeding generations \r\n12/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nfrom the scourge of war. The Organization deserves \r\nthe highest credit for its achievement in preventing \r\nthe outbreak of another world war of the kind that has \r\nplagued us twice in the past. On the other hand, it is \r\nconfronted with regional conflicts, a rising tide of \r\nnon-traditional threats and violent extremism. We need \r\nto do more to address these challenges, collectively.\r\nThere are also achievements in bringing a better \r\nlife to all. Lifting millions out of poverty, sending \r\nmillions more children to school, combating deadly \r\ndiseases, and promoting gender equality and human \r\nrights are remarkable milestones in the United Nations \r\njourney. The unanimous adoption of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) last week \r\nhas added to the long list of its achievements.\r\nStill, daunting challenges remain. The colonial \r\nlegacy with its inherited divisions influences today’s \r\nconflicts across the world, depriving many of economic \r\nand social development. The rising threats of terrorism \r\nand acts of violent extremism need to be addressed \r\ndecisively. Climate change and environmental \r\ndegradation are undermining the development and \r\nlives of the poor. Inequalities are widening, pushing \r\nthe poor further behind. The time is now opportune \r\nto do soul-searching on the future of the Organization \r\nand to strengthen our collective resolve to address \r\nthe challenges of our time, particularly to advance its \r\npriorities, capacity and reform.\r\nToday’s new and emerging challenges are \r\nincreasingly calling the effectiveness and efficiency \r\nof the Organization into question. While the cardinal \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations remain \r\nvalid today, the world Organization, which was founded \r\nseven decades ago, needs to be reformed in conformity \r\nwith today’s changing realities and the drastic growth \r\nin membership. We believe that the Security Council \r\nalso has to be reformed to make it more representative, \r\nefficient and transparent and to strengthen its capacity \r\nto better discharge its responsibilities to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security, as entrusted by the \r\nCharter.\r\nAs part of the United Nations reform, we set up \r\nthe Human Rights Council in 2006 to redress the \r\nshortcomings of its predecessor, the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights. Yet, human rights issues are increasingly \r\npoliticized and exploited. The principles of universality, \r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity are at stake. Myanmar \r\nfirmly believes that the universal periodic review is the \r\nforum where promotion and protection of human rights \r\ncan best be addressed with objectivity and impartiality \r\non an equal footing.\r\nThe most significant milestone contribution \r\nMyanmar has made to the United Nations was providing \r\nthe Organization with a Secretary-General. He served \r\nthe Organization from 1961 to 1971 at a difficult \r\ntime of ideological contention, mistrust and security \r\ntensions among nations. He played an important role in \r\nenhancing security and expanding the Organization’s \r\nwork on economic and social development in poor \r\ncountries. The United Nations Development Programme \r\nand the United Nations Environment Programme \r\nwere also initiated. U Thant believed that the United \r\nNations needed to meet the needs and hopes of people \r\neverywhere. That vision is more relevant than ever \r\nto the work of the Organization and should guide us \r\nbeyond the United Nations at 70.\r\nDuring the tenure of the present Government, \r\nMyanmar has moved to raise its profile in the field \r\nof disarmament. We started with the signing of the \r\nAdditional Protocol of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency in September 2013. That was followed \r\nby Myanmar’s ratification of the Convention on the \r\nProhibition of the Development, Production and \r\nStockpiling of Bacteriological (Biological) and Toxin \r\nWeapons and on Their Destruction in December \r\n2014 and of the Convention on the Prohibition of the \r\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of \r\nChemical Weapons and on Their Destruction.\r\nThese actions demonstrate Myanmar’s dedicated \r\ncommitment to the cause of disarmament. Every \r\nyear Myanmar introduces a resolution on nuclear \r\ndisarmament that is adopted with the support of a great \r\nmajority of Member States. The resolution reflects our \r\nfirm conviction that our world will be more secure and \r\nsafer without nuclear weapons. As the main sponsor of \r\nthe resolution, once again we invite all Member States \r\nto continue to support the resolution this year.\r\nPeacekeeping has been one of the most effective \r\ntools available to the United Nations to assist countries \r\nstruggling on their difficult path from conflict to \r\npeace. Today, the nature of conflicts is changing and \r\nbecomes increasingly complex. We therefore welcome \r\nthe Secretary-General’s timely efforts reviewing \r\nUnited Nations peace operations. At the same time, it is \r\nof paramount importance not to weaken the principles \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter as well as the \r\n15-29822 13/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\ncardinal principles of traditional peacekeeping of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFifteen years ago, we gathered here and committed \r\nourselves to fight against poverty. We set ambitious \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) and targets. \r\nWhile we have lifted more than 1 billion people out \r\nof extreme poverty, some 800 million people are still \r\nexcessively poor. Myanmar has made notable progress \r\nin poverty and hunger reduction, eliminating gender \r\ndisparity in basic education, reducing the child mortality \r\nrate, improving maternal health and advancing a global \r\npartnership for development. The adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development this year will take \r\nover the unfinished business of the MDGs. Political \r\ncommitment, enhanced partnership, the strengthening \r\nof capacity and the provision of adequate means of \r\nimplementation will be keys to success in realizing \r\nambitious Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \r\nUnilateral economic sanctions imposed on \r\ndeveloping countries have a negative impact on their \r\nefforts on behalf of their people. They will also hinder \r\nthe realization of the SDGs. We therefore call for the \r\nearly lifting of such measures.\r\nThe world is experiencing shifting patterns of \r\nrainfall and snowfall, rising temperatures and heavy \r\nrainstorms. While we envisage a sustainable and \r\nresilient planet, scientific agencies agree that human \r\nactivities are contributing to climate change. This is the \r\ntime to translate commitments into action and not to \r\nargue. It is crucial that the 2015 Paris Climate Change \r\nConference reach a meaningful and universal climate \r\nchange agreement keeping global warming below 2°C. \r\nIt must also include obligations to provide the least \r\ndeveloped countries with adequate and additional \r\nfinancial and technological resources to help address \r\nthe impacts of climate change.\r\nMigration definitely is not a new phenomenon. \r\nMyanmar shares the concerns expressed by many in \r\nthis Hall about the migratiants in Europe and Asia. \r\nSaving lives on the journey, better legal migration \r\npolicies, creating better opportunities at home and \r\nthe suppression of people smuggling and trafficking \r\nnetworks are essential to addressing illegal migration \r\neverywhere. We strongly believe that economic \r\nmigration and human trafficking must be urgently \r\naddressed in a comprehensive manner.\r\nLet me turn to the state of affairs in my home \r\ncountry, Myanmar. Democratic reforms started in 2011. \r\nThe Government is now consolidating firm foundations \r\nfor democracy. The reforms have widened the \r\ndemocratic space, advanced economic performance and \r\nnarrowed differences with the non-State armed groups. \r\nA new political culture of dialogue has taken root as \r\nMyanmar opened its doors to different political forces \r\nsince the early days of the reforms. Amnesties were \r\ngranted on several occasions allowing former prisoners \r\nto take part in nation-building endeavours. Activists, \r\nmedia people, entrepreneurs and academicians living \r\nabroad have returned home. They are working hand in \r\nhand with the Government for the common goal of a \r\npeaceful and prosperous Myanmar. Unavoidably, there \r\nare still challenges typical of a young democracy, but \r\nwe believe they are not insurmountable.\r\nEconomic sector reform has proven successful. \r\nMyanmar maintains an average growth rate of 8 per \r\ncent gross domestic product in a four-year time frame. \r\nMyanmar is aiming at graduating from the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) group at an early date. \r\nThat is feasible if we can maintain this average annual \r\ngrowth rate over the coming years. The framework \r\nfor economic and social reforms launched in 2013 for \r\nsustainable economic growth and poverty reduction \r\nis a solid platform for our LDC graduation ambition. \r\nOne International Monetary Fund evaluation is that \r\neconomic prospects of Myanmar remain strong.\r\nMyanmar is a multi-ethnic and multi-religious \r\ncountry where freedom of religion is guaranteed in its \r\nState Constitution. The houses of worship of different \r\nfaiths stand side by side across the country where \r\ndifferent communities share the same neighbourhood. \r\nThe situation in Rakhine state has changed. The \r\nGovernment has managed not only to prevent any new \r\nviolence but has also started to promote a culture of \r\npeace through interfaith dialogue and talks among \r\ncommunities and their leaders. Peace and stability has \r\nbeen restored.\r\nAs I speak, more than 20 different aid organizations \r\nare providing humanitarian and other assistance in \r\nRakhine state. We thank the regional and international \r\npartners for their kind assistance to humanitarian, \r\nresettlement, reintegration and development needs. \r\nThe Interfaith Friendship Group in Myanmar has a \r\nnationwide set-up and is composed of representatives \r\nof all faiths. The Group holds monthly meetings and \r\nconveys messages of peace and harmony to the public. \r\nThey also make religious site visits and provide \r\nassistance to the needy as necessary. Various civil \r\n14/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nsociety organizations are also playing their part in \r\nbridging different communities.\r\nPeace is a prerequisite for national reconciliation \r\nand a cornerstone for building a new democratic society \r\nin Myanmar. Democracy will not f lourish in the absence \r\nof peace. Without peace, economic development will \r\nnot be sustained. In this strong conviction, President \r\nThein Sein extended an olive branch to armed groups \r\nshortly after taking office with the aim of building \r\nsustainable and lasting peace in Myanmar.\r\nNegotiations have been going on to determine the \r\ntiming and modality for the signing of a nationwide \r\nceasefire agreement. The Government, for its part, is \r\nfully prepared and patiently waiting for signature. We \r\nare hoping to sign the nationwide ceasefire agreement \r\nin the very near future. We will then continue \r\ndiscussions over the framework for a political dialogue. \r\nWe appreciate the interest in and support of the \r\ninternational community for our peace process.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights \r\nhave always been high on our agenda. Recent reforms \r\nin Myanmar have contributed to our people’s ability to \r\nbetter enjoy fundamental human rights and freedoms. \r\nThe Myanmar National Human Rights Commission, \r\nfirst established in 2011, was reconstituted in line with \r\nthe Paris Principles following the enactment of the \r\nMyanmar National Human Rights Commission Law in \r\n2014.\r\nWidening the space for people to express their \r\nviews and opinions has been one of the most visible \r\ndevelopments in Myanmar. Greater media freedom \r\nhas been granted throughout the country by abolishing \r\npress censorship and permitting the publication of daily \r\nnewspapers and weekly journals. Myanmar has also \r\nmade significant progress in expanding the rights to \r\nfreedom of peaceful assembly and of association.\r\nOur signing of the International Covenant on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights in July 2015 and \r\nthe Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights \r\nof the Child on the involvement of children in armed \r\nconflict on 28 September was clear testimony to rising \r\nhuman rights standards in Myanmar.\r\nMyanmar suffered a devastating natural disaster in \r\nlate July and August in the wake of Cyclone Komen. \r\nThe damage inflicted by f loods and landslides \r\nfrom torrential rains this year is more intense and \r\nwidespread than that of cyclone Nargis seven years ago. \r\nWe appreciate the kind assistance given to the affected \r\npeople by friendly countries near and far, the United \r\nNations and the international community.\r\nThis year, 2015, is vital for Myanmar as we will \r\nhold general elections on 8 November. The forthcoming \r\nelections will be transparent, free and fair. As such, the \r\nGovernment is working together with local stakeholders \r\nand international partners.\r\nOver the past four and a half years, we have been \r\nable to enhance peace, stability and the rule of law and \r\nsocioeconomic development in the country. Some may \r\nnot be content with the pace of our reform process. \r\nHowever, it is undeniable that we have been able to create \r\nbetter political and socio-economic conditions, foster \r\nnational reconciliation through a culture of dialogue, \r\nand expand space for civil societies in nation-building.\r\nIn closing, it is important to highlight that \r\nMyanmar’s democratic reform process is gaining \r\nmomentum and moving in the right direction. The \r\ninternational community should continue its support \r\nto Myanmar in an objective and constructive manner. \r\nWe shall remain fully committed and relentless in \r\nour efforts for peace, democracy and inclusive socio-\r\neconomic development for the people of Myanmar.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Aïchatou Boulama Kané, Minister of State, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation and African \r\nIntegration and Nigeriens Abroad of Niger.\r\nMs. Kané (Niger) (spoke in French): It is a real \r\npleasure and an immense privilege to take the f loor \r\nbefore the Assembly at this historic celebration of the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations. First, \r\nI wish to address my warm congratulations to you, \r\nSir, on your outstanding election to head the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth regular session. Your vast \r\nexperience of international and parliamentary issues, \r\ntogether with your eminent personal and professional \r\nskills, are a guarantee for the success of our work.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to your predecessor, \r\nMr. Sam Kahamba Kutesa, for having presided \r\nbrilliantly over the sixty-ninth session. To the Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, I reiterate the gratitude of my \r\ndelegation for the special interest he has always shown \r\nin seeking solutions to the many challenges that the \r\nUnited Nations and its Members have had to face.\r\nThis session in an historic one, as I said earlier, \r\nand the theme that you, Sir, have chosen for the general \r\n15-29822 15/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\ndebate this year — “The United Nations at 70: the \r\nroad ahead for peace, security and human rights” — is \r\nvery timely because it is both an appeal to take stock \r\nand a look to the future of the United Nations work \r\nin the service of international peace and security, \r\neconomic and social development and human rights. \r\nIn that respect, we welcome the fact that the principles \r\nenunciated in the Charter of the United Nations have \r\nstood the test of time and that the United Nations has \r\nmany successes to its credit. \r\nIn the area of international peace and security, \r\nour Organization has played an appreciable role in \r\nresolving conflicts and preventing others, in particular \r\nwith the establishment of preventive diplomacy in 1997. \r\nThe adoption in 2001 of the United Nations Programme \r\nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit \r\nTrade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All Its \r\nAspects; the adoption of the Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nStrategy in 2006; the relaunching of the Conference \r\non Disarmament with a view to recommendations on \r\nnuclear disarmament and practical confidence-building \r\nmeasures for conventional weapons; and most recently \r\nthe conclusion of the Arms Trade Treaty all attest to the \r\nUnited Nations progress towards its goals.\r\nWith regard to the maintenance or re-establishment \r\nof international peace and security, peacekeeping \r\noperations are increasingly carried out with the \r\nparticipation of regional organizations and have evolved \r\nsignificantly in scope and mandate in order to adapt \r\nto crisis and conflicts that have become increasingly \r\ncomplex. Moreover, in the weeks to come the General \r\nAssembly will discuss in-depth the new report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the future of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations (see A//70/95). In this respect, \r\nI should like to emphasize that Niger is the world’s \r\nseventeenth-largest troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountry, with 1,826 men and women in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations in 2015. \r\nWith regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nthe International Court of Justice, established by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations as the principal \r\njudiciary organ of the United Nations, has contributed \r\nto maintaining international peace by handing down \r\ndecisions and advisory opinions in resolution of a \r\nvariety of many disputes. The Niger trusts the Court \r\nand has resorted to it in two border disputes with \r\nneighbouring States, which not only allowed those \r\ndisputes to be permanently settled but also reaffirmed \r\ngood-neighbourliness and cooperation with these \r\ncountries.\r\nIn the same vein, the conclusion in July of \r\nnegotiations agreement between the five permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council and Germany, on the \r\none hand, and the Islamic Republic of Iran, on the other, \r\nwith regard to the nuclear programme of the latter, was \r\nin our opinion a real reason for satisfaction.\r\nIn the Middle East, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, \r\nwhich began several years after the creation of the \r\nUnited Nations, has not yet been resolved, despite its \r\nheavy toll in human lives, mainly civilians, and the \r\nmany initiatives of the United Nations and the peace \r\nplans initiated by other members of the international \r\ncommunity. The Niger continues to stand with the \r\nPalestinian people and supports all efforts that could \r\nlead to a comprehensive peace based on the two-State \r\nsolution, with an independent and viable Palestine \r\nliving side by side in peace and security with Israel and \r\nneighbouring countries. We were therefore pleased to \r\nattend on 30 September the raising of the Palestinian \r\nf lag alongside those of States Members at the United \r\nNations.\r\nAlso in the Middle East, the wars raging in Syria, \r\nIraq and Yemen are reasons for genuine concern. They \r\nhave inflicted terrible suffering on civilians, who \r\nhave been compelled to seek refuge elsewhere. This \r\nhas created humanitarian crises embodied in the daily \r\ntragedy of immigrants in the Mediterranean Sea and \r\nalong the eastern borders of Europe.\r\nIn Africa, the ongoing situation in South Sudan is yet \r\nanother source of great concern, despite the agreement \r\nsigned in August. In Burkina Faso, we welcome the \r\nsuccesful resolution of the situation and the relaunch \r\nof the democratic transition thanks to the efforts of the \r\nAfrican Union and the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States (ECOWAS). In the Central African \r\nRepublic, we welcome the Bangui Forum for National \r\nReconciliation and call on all parties to implement \r\nits outcome. We express our great concern, however, \r\non the subject of recent events that may undermine \r\nsecurity and respect for the agreed agenda.\r\nIn Mali, despite the presence of the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in Mali and Operation Barkhane, terrorist \r\ngroups continue to carry out criminal acts against \r\nthe civilian population and the peacekeeping forces. \r\nThe signing on 20 June at Bamako of the Agreement \r\n16/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nfor Peace and Reconciliation in Mali was a crucial \r\nmilestone in restoring peace, security and stability \r\nand in creating conditions conducive to economic \r\nand social development in that country. The effective \r\nimplementation of the Agreement must be supported by \r\nthe entire international community.\r\nIn Libya, the situation remains very alarming \r\nand require the international community to be \r\nfurther involved so as to persuade the Libyan people \r\nto reconcile and fight together against the terrorist \r\ngroups sowing despair throughout the country. We \r\nsee every day how their activities compromise efforts \r\naimed at genuine national reconciliation, which is a \r\nsine qua non condition to restore peace and stability \r\nand ensure the economic and social development that \r\nthe Libyan people legitimately deserve. That situation \r\nis also a serious threat to the security of the Niger, a \r\nneighbouring country, and the entire Sahelo-Saharan \r\nregion. In regard, we sincerely hope that the United \r\nNations-led peace process under Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General Bernardino León will be \r\ncrowned with success.\r\nTo those general situations of conflict are also \r\nadded violent extremism and international terrorism, \r\nwhich are increasingly taking on worrying dimensions \r\nwith the acquisition of heavy weapons and the desire \r\nto conquer territories and destabilize the area to an \r\nunprecedented degree. However, we have to be pleased \r\nby the awareness on the part of the international \r\ncommunity of the danger that represents, as well as \r\nby its commitment to face it. Whether it is the United \r\nNations through the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil or the actions of regional organizations and \r\nsubregional organizations such as the African Union, \r\nECOWAS, the Lake Chad Basin Commission, the \r\nEuropean Union and the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation, the international community is showing \r\ngreat mobilization to eradicate this scourge.\r\nAs for the Boko Haram sect, which is disturbing \r\nthe peace in the Lake Chad Basin, it will certainly be \r\ndefeated by the effective operation of the multilateral \r\nmixed force established by Cameroon, the Niger, \r\nNigeria, Chad and the members of the Lake Chad Basin, \r\nas well as Benin. We would like to thank the members \r\nof the Security Council for the statement issued in \r\nAugust that urged the international community to \r\ncontribute all the necessary support to the States of \r\nthe region, in particular the members of the Lake Chad \r\nBasin Commission plus Benin. For its part, Niger is \r\nactively committed to combating terrorism and, in \r\nclose cooperation with its partners, has strengthened \r\nits national committee to combat all forms of terrorism \r\nas part of a regional and international undertaking to \r\ncombat this scourge.\r\nAs the President of the Republic of the Niger, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, said on \r\nthe occasion of his speech to the audience at Harvard \r\nUniversity on 3 April,\r\n“The Clauswitz triad, people, government, \r\narmy, which has always been sought in the past in \r\nso-called industrial wars, functions very well in \r\nasymmetric wars conducted by terrorists. While \r\nsome claim to be carrying out jihad in the name of \r\nAllah, Islam is a religion of peace and tolerance. \r\nIslam asks Muslims to seek knowledge and, as the \r\nProphet has said, to do so as far as China, so as to \r\nlearn from the cradle to the grave. The terrorists \r\nof Boko Haram, like all other terrorists, are not \r\nMuslims. On the contrary, they are the worst \r\nenemies of Islam. For those reasons, Boko Haram \r\nhas no future and will be vanquished.”\r\nWith regard to human rights, since the adoption, \r\non 10 December 1948, of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights we have witnessed an impressive \r\ndevelopment of international law and human rights law \r\nthrough the conclusion of numerous international legal \r\ninstruments covering almost all aspects, including new \r\nrights. At the same time, important progress has been \r\nmade in the codification of international law.\r\nWith regard to the challenge of migration, we are \r\ndelighted that the international community is concerned \r\nwith dealing with this important issue appropriately \r\nand on a global basis. The Niger is a country of origin, \r\na host country and a country of transit. We believe that \r\nis imperative to find immediate palliative solutions \r\nthat will stop clandestine immigration, dismantle \r\nthe criminal economy that underlies it and solve the \r\nproblem by attacking the deep causes of migration \r\nin countries of origin, causes which are of a security \r\nnature, economic and climate and sometimes political \r\ndue to bad governance.\r\nIn the area of economic and social development, the \r\nUnited Nations system, through the operational activities \r\nof its agencies, funds, programmes and specialized \r\nagencies, has provided technical assistance, capacity-\r\nbuilding and development projects to developing \r\ncountries. I am pleased to note that the United Nations \r\n15-29822 17/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nsystem has acted as a neutral and trusted partner in \r\nsupporting Governments, while helping them with their \r\nleadership and to fulfil their international commitments \r\nand implement their development strategies.\r\nThe Niger acceded to the United Nations on \r\n20 September 1960 under the sponsorship of Tunisia, \r\nwhich we commend for its constant friendship as we mark \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of our common Organization. \r\nEver since, the Niger has been resolutely committed to \r\ninternational solidarity. On this solemn occasion, we \r\nwelcome the new turning point of the United Nations \r\nto go beyond the Millennium Development Goals and \r\nbring about the essential changes to our planet so that \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals do not just mean \r\nrhetoric, but a true commitment to sustainable global \r\ndevelopment.\r\nA new commitment to act is a commitment for the \r\npeoples of the world, to whom we must provide peace, \r\nstability and development. It is a commitment to heighten \r\nthe spirit of sharing and solidarity at the global level. \r\nIt represents a driving force break down the barriers \r\nof inequality between and within nations. Finally, it is \r\nabout building a more just and more human world. That \r\nis why the Niger believes that “Transforming our world: \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” must \r\nbe implemented effectively.\r\nThe commitments that we have all signed on to \r\nhave meaning only if they are part of active solidarity \r\nand renewed partnership. The United Nations system \r\nmust be an important actor in the implementation of the \r\n17 Sustainable Development Goals and the 169 targets, \r\nincluding the means of implementation and the follow-\r\nup review mechanism. I hope that they will allow for \r\nprogress beyond the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand contribute to meeting the challenges we face to \r\nreach the future we want, namely, economic, social and \r\nenvironmental well-being for all. I also hope that the \r\nAgenda’s implementation will take into account the \r\nclose link existing between security, development and \r\nclimate.\r\nI also welcome the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on \r\nfinancing for development, adopted in July, wherein \r\npartners reaffirmed their commitment to support \r\ndeveloping countries with a view to inclusive economic \r\nand social growth and sustainable development, in \r\nparticular via increased, predictable and steady official \r\ndevelopment assistance and other public and private \r\nfinancing sources.\r\nWhile the wounds left by the structural adjustment \r\nprogrammes of the 1980s and 1990s have not yet healed, \r\nthe 2008 economic and financial crisis has gravely \r\nundermined the growth achieved during the 2000s. \r\nThe economies of developing countries — in particular \r\nthe most vulnerable among them, such as landlocked \r\ncountries, least developed countries and small island \r\ndeveloping States — have been the most affected. In \r\nthat regard, I underscore the importance for us of the \r\nspeeding up the comprehensive implementation of the \r\ncommitments under the Istanbul Programme of Action \r\nfor the Least Developed Countries and the Vienna \r\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries. \r\nWe also hope that the Paris Climate Summit will \r\nproduce a binding legal instrument that includes \r\neffective steps to mitigage the effects of climate change, \r\nincluding adaptation measures for these countries in \r\nline with the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. At the same time, the commitments \r\nmade with regard for the Green Climate Fund should \r\nbe both respected stepped up. We welcome all the \r\nefforts that the French Government has made under the \r\nleadership of President François Hollande to guarantee \r\nthe success of the upcoming historic climate meeting.\r\nWe must also redouble our efforts with regard to \r\nthe commitments made under the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda on Financing for Development, the post-2015 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the measures \r\nto be decided at the twenty-first Conference of Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change.\r\nNiger is continuing to implement an economic and \r\nsocial development programme that runs through the \r\nend of this year. It aims at economic growth and access \r\nby all the people of the Niger to basic social services. A \r\nnew development programme, known as Vision 2035, \r\nwill follow thereafter, with a focus on inclusive growth. \r\nIt is therefore important that there be an appropriate \r\nmobilization of financial means and assistance for \r\ncapacity-building, the facilitation of trade, technology \r\nand private investment.\r\nOn the political front, we intend to entrench and \r\nenhance good democratic governance as an essential \r\nfactor for all development. In that connection, in early \r\n2016 we will hold a series of elections for the renewal \r\nof the mandates of our institutions. Our presidential, \r\nlegislative and local elections will be transparent, free \r\n18/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nand inclusive. I invite all of our partners to support the \r\nNiger in that undertaking of consolidating democracy \r\nin my country.\r\nThe international system also needs democratic \r\ngovernance. That is particularly necessary because it is \r\nclearly recognized that the problems we are facing are \r\non a worldwide scale, and therefore deserve responses \r\nof the same scope and through comprehensive \r\nmultilateralism. The seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations should be taken advantage of to examine \r\nhow it functions and make progress in determining the \r\nnecessary adjustments so that the Organization, and the \r\nSecurity Council in particular, will ref lect the current \r\nreality of the world. Africa, which was not present when \r\nthe United Nations was established because it was still \r\nunder colonial domination, has to correct the historic \r\ninjustice it has had with regard to its representation in \r\nthe Security Council. In accordance with the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus, and in line with deliberations of the African \r\nUnion, our continent should be represented in both \r\ncategories of membership, with two permanent and \r\nfive non-permanent seats. Furthermore, the General \r\nAssembly — the pre-eminent and most representative \r\norgan — should be revitalized so that it can play its \r\nrole in finding solutions to the different challenges in \r\naccordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter.\r\nThe Niger believes in multilateralism, sustained \r\nsolidarity among peoples and the virtues of dialogue \r\namong States. In line with those principles, we commend \r\nthe restoration of diplomatic relations between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba and hope that the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations will coincide with \r\nthe end of an economic embargo against Cuba’s people \r\nthat is so unfair.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nLyompo Damcho Dorji, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nBhutan.\r\nMr. Dorji (Bhutan): At the outset, I should like to \r\nconvey to the members of the General Assembly the \r\nwarm greetings of His Majesty the King of Bhutan. I \r\nshould also like to congratulate you on your election, \r\nMr. President, and to assure you of my delegation’s full \r\nsupport in the discharge of your responsibilities. I also \r\nthank Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session, for his able leadership over the past \r\nyear, in particular in steering to a successful conclusion \r\nthe complex negotiations on the post-2015 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Agenda (resolution 70/1). I also thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his team for their \r\ntireless efforts to advance the multifaceted work of the \r\nOrganization over the past year.\r\nAt 70, the United Nations, underpinned by \r\nmultilateralism and the sovereign equality of nations, \r\nremains indispensable. It embodies the collective will \r\nand conscience of humankind for a more peaceful, \r\nsecure and prosperous world. Its existence reflects our \r\nenduring commitment to the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. It unites all \r\nnations — big or small, rich or poor — to work together \r\nto realize our shared goals and aspirations.\r\nOver the last seven decades, the United Nations has \r\ndelivered much of what is promised in its Charter, and \r\nit is only fitting that we pay tribute to its achievements: \r\nfrom saving millions of lives through relief efforts, \r\nvaccinating children, eradicating smallpox and fighting \r\nAIDS to feeding millions every year in countries \r\naffected by war, conflict and natural disasters; from \r\nnegotiating peace deals and conducting peacekeeping \r\noperations to advancing democracy and creating an \r\ninternational human rights system; and from combating \r\nclimate change and reducing extreme poverty to \r\npreventing the spread and use of nuclear weapons. \r\nThose and other achievements of the United Nations are \r\nindeed noteworthy.\r\nHowever, even as we celebrate those achievements, \r\nit would serve us well to take stock of the state of \r\nour interdependent world and the road ahead for \r\nthe Organization. For every day we are confronted \r\nwith compelling evidence that shows we are far from \r\nachieving our quest for peace, security, prosperity and \r\nhuman dignity for all — whether it is conflicts and acts \r\nof terrorism, the unthinkable stockpiles of weapons of \r\nmass destruction, the inequalities that persist within and \r\namong nations, the rising expectations of billions living \r\nat the very margins of existence, or climate change that \r\nthreatens our very survival — failure to address those \r\ninterrelated global challenges is not an option.\r\nPeace, security and human rights must go hand in \r\nhand with sustainable development. Over the past few \r\nyears, we have taken stock of the state of our world, \r\nour peoples and our planet. We have undertaken \r\na comprehensive review of the challenges and \r\nopportunities. And in a spirit of cooperation that many \r\nthought impossible, we have adopted an ambitious and \r\ntransformative Agenda for Sustainable Development. It \r\n15-29822 19/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nis now time to translate the 2030 Agenda into concrete \r\nactions in earnest, individually and collectively.\r\nSince joining the United Nations, 44 years ago, \r\nunder the wise and able leadership of our monarchs \r\nthe people of Bhutan have endeavoured to fulfil the \r\nvision and goals set forth in the Charter. Guided by our \r\ndevelopment philosophy of Gross National Happiness \r\n(GNH), which is essentially development with values, \r\nwe have consistently worked to ensure that the peace, \r\nsecurity, happiness and well-being of our people always \r\nremain at the centre of our development efforts.\r\nBhutan has achieved most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goal targets. Poverty has been reduced \r\nto 12 per cent. Our primary school enrolment rate is \r\nnearly 100 per cent and life expectancy has increased \r\nto 68 years. We remain a bastion of environmental \r\nconservation with 72 per cent of our land under forest \r\ncover. Our effort to safeguard the environment is \r\nreinforced by a constitutional mandate to maintain a \r\nminimum of 60 per cent of our land under forest cover \r\nfor all time. Our achievements would not have been \r\npossible without good governance. Over decades, under \r\nthe enlightened leadership of our monarchs, we have \r\nsuccessfully embraced democracy. \r\nPeace, security and human rights depend on \r\nan all-inclusive approach to development that puts \r\npeople and the environment at the centre. In 2011, \r\nBhutan spearheaded the adoption of resolution 65/309, \r\nentitled “Happiness: towards a holistic approach to \r\ndevelopment”. A year later, we were gratified by the \r\ndecision of the General Assembly to observe 20 March \r\neach year as the International Day of Happiness. The \r\npursuit of happiness is a fundamental human goal and \r\nembodies the spirit of the 2030 Agenda. We stand ready \r\nto share our experience with GNH and to contribute \r\nto the growing discourse on holistic development \r\nparadigms and indicators. \r\nEven though we have contributed least to the \r\ncauses of climate change, we, like other least developed \r\ncountries, are among the most vulnerable to its adverse \r\nimpacts. Despite our limited resources and competing \r\ndemands of development, Bhutan remains committed \r\nto the conservation of our natural heritage, and in fact \r\nhas consistently contributed more than its fair share to \r\nglobal efforts to combat climate change. In 2009, Bhutan \r\npledged to remain carbon neutral for all time. We have \r\nkept that promise. Our expectation is that, through the \r\nsale of clean hydro-power, by 2025 Bhutan will have \r\nthe capacity to offset approximately 35 million tons \r\nof carbon per annum in the region. That is no small \r\nfeat, considering Bhutan’s emissions constitute less \r\nthan 7 per cent of that figure. I am pleased to state that, \r\nthis week, Bhutan ratified the Doha mendment to the \r\nKyoto Protocol and submitted its intended nationally \r\ndetermined contributions to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nTo support the work of the United Nations in \r\nthe area of international peace and security, Bhutan \r\nbegan contributing to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations in 2014. We remain a committed partner and \r\nare working to deepen and broaden our peacekeeping \r\nengagement with the United Nations. Today it is a \r\nmatter of great pride that Bhutanese peacekeepers are \r\ndeployed and serving in nine peacekeeping missions.\r\nWe have no doubt that implementing the 2030 \r\nAgenda within the next 15 years will be a daunting \r\nchallenge. Achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) will require countries, both developed \r\nand developing alike, to take stock of their existing \r\ndevelopment strategies and embark on far-reaching \r\nreforms to implement the Agenda. For a country like \r\nBhutan, which is least developed and landlocked, \r\naddressing the challenges will require innovative and \r\ncreative approaches to build on the progress we have \r\nmade thus far.\r\nA key challenge we face is to build a strong and \r\nsustainable green economy that ensures gainful \r\nemployment for our youth, inclusive growth and \r\npromotes self-reliance. With a narrow industrial \r\nbase and a high dependency on a single sector, our \r\neconomy is faced with unprecedented macroeconomic \r\nchallenges, despite otherwise prolonged periods of \r\nrobust economic growth. A careful reorientation of our \r\neconomy is imperative if we are to ensure that our future \r\ndevelopment is inclusive and sustainable as envisaged in \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. In that regard, the continued support \r\nand cooperation of our development partners will be \r\ncrucial as we seek innovative approaches to balance \r\nour environmental aspirations and developmental \r\nneeds. That takes on even greater importance as Bhutan \r\nprogresses towards graduation from the category of \r\nleast developed countries to ensure that hard-earned \r\ndevelopmental gains are sustained.\r\nI should like to underscore the vital importance \r\nof education to achieve our transformative agenda. \r\nMany of the SDGs will not be attainable if we do not \r\n20/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nrelentlessly invest in building a dynamic and relevant \r\neducation system in our countries, a system that \r\nnurtures our children and youth with the right values, \r\nknowledge and skills that reflect our aspirations and \r\ngoals. In that regard, we are happy to note that ensuring \r\ninclusive and equitable quality education for all is \r\na stand-alone Goal in the 2030 Agenda. In moving \r\nforward, SDG 4 must remain at the forefront of our \r\nplanning and implementation of national strategies to \r\nachieve the SDGs. The education sector, which has \r\nalways been accorded high priority by Bhutan, will \r\nbe given special emphasis as we mainstream the 2030 \r\nAgenda in our national strategies and plans. We hope \r\nthat our development partners will share our sense of \r\npriority and urgency in this vital area and support our \r\nefforts to ensure that it is relevant to achieve the 2030 \r\nAgenda.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda sets out a necessarily ambitious \r\nvision and SDGs. We have no doubt of the complexity \r\nand enormity of the tasks for its implementation. It \r\nwill require systemic new thinking and a long-term \r\nperspective in our planning. It will require sincere \r\nglobal partnerships, predictable resources and the \r\ncollaboration and commitment of all our people.\r\nThe first litmus test for our commitment to action \r\non the 2030 Agenda will be whether or not we reach an \r\nambitious and legally binding agreement at the twenty-\r\nfirst Conference of Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. That \r\nagreement must be firmly anchored in the principles of \r\nthe Convention, including the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities.\r\nMr. Fornell (Ecuador), Vice President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nOur decisions in Paris must be driven by the latest \r\nscience. The evidence is unequivocal. An emissions \r\npathway taking us beyond 1.5° C above pre-industrial \r\nlevels would have disproportionate and irreversible \r\nimpacts on the most vulnerable among us. A second \r\ntest of our commitment to action would be whether we \r\nare able to deliver on our promises and pledges on the \r\nmeans of implementation for the 2030 Agenda. And, \r\nfinally, are we able to make tangible progress in the \r\narea of United Nations reforms?\r\nReal progress in the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council \r\nis critical to ensure a robust mechanism for the \r\nimplementation of the Agenda. Furthermore, the \r\nSecurity Council must be reformed to reflect current \r\ngeopolitical realities, through the commencement of \r\ntext-based negotiations on the basis of decision 69/560, \r\nwhich was adopted by consensus.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda provides us a \r\nhistoric opportunity to truly awaken our spirit of global \r\nsolidarity and shared values for the sake of our children \r\nand our planet. In the words of His Majesty the King \r\nof Bhutan,\r\n“Let us place the interest of humanity, not \r\nnational populations and constituencies, above all \r\nelse. Let us take political risks and strong decisions \r\nin addressing the needs of humanity. The answer to \r\nglobal problems will come closer at hand when we \r\ngrasp that universal simplicity — that sense of a \r\nshared planet and a shared fate for those who walk \r\non it. We need shared human endeavour not just \r\nnegotiated change.” \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Taukelina Finikaso, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, Trade, Tourism, Environment and \r\nLabour of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Finikaso (Tuvalu): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Tuvalu, it is indeed a \r\ngreat honour and pleasure to deliver this statement \r\nat the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I \r\ncongratulate the President on his election and wish \r\nthe Assembly success and blessings under his able \r\nguidance and leadership. May the Good Lord bless and \r\nsustain him and our United Nations.\r\nI also wish to thank the former President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, Mr. Sam Kutesa, for delivering the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) and the many other core successes of 2015 in our \r\ntransition from the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) era to that of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). We applaud all the Chairs of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits — on disaster \r\nrisk reduction in Sendai, on financing for development \r\nin Addis Ababa and last week’s Summit for the adoption \r\nof the Agenda. We thank the entire membership and \r\nmembers of non-governmental organizations, civil \r\nsociety, the private sector and academia, who all \r\ncontributed to the dialogues, negotiations and drafting \r\nresponsibilities. Let me also pay tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and his managers, the Secretariat \r\nand all the specialized United Nations agencies, staff \r\nand peacekeepers, who are honouring the citizens of \r\n15-29822 21/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nthe world with the best of their service, energy and \r\ncommitment.\r\nIt has been 70 years of successful life for this \r\nsacred institution, and we have also exhausted the 15 \r\nyears of the MDGs. How we have fared is a key beacon \r\nof the relevance and effectiveness of multilateralism \r\nand this solemn union, the United Nations. The noble \r\nvisions and principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations remain pertinent and vital for \r\nsuccessive generations that long for peace, security \r\nand prosperity. The MDGs saved millions from hunger \r\nand poverty. We are more technologically advanced, \r\nmore connected, more cooperative and more aware \r\nof the global issues — and certainly have resisted the \r\ntemptation of an all-out world war.\r\nYet we must be honest with ourselves and note that \r\nthere are persisting inequities, recurring insecurities \r\nand planetary distress that require our urgent attention. \r\nA significant number of “we the people” globally \r\nare still homeless, jobless, with many more are \r\nbecoming displaced and stateless. Many are deprived \r\nof opportunities for education and health services, and \r\nmany still have a hopeless future, and as such, extremism \r\nhas become an alternative choice of existence for those \r\ndisoriented, if not lost, souls.\r\nIn short, there are still many left behind. As we \r\nare fully aware, it is usually the aged, women, youth, \r\nthe disabled and little children who are deprived and \r\nrobbed of their fundamental rights to be human in such \r\ndire situations. We must have a United Nations answer. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with \r\nits 17 Goals and 169 targets, must deliver for the \r\npeople. Every child, every woman, every citizen, every \r\ncommunity should know the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and own the rights under these Goals. The Goals \r\nmust be advocated as widely as possible to all global \r\ncitizens through the technological advances that we \r\nhave for information and communication so that they \r\ncan be understood, owned and adhered to by one and all. \r\nThe Goals must bring about accountability on the part \r\nof our leaders, our development partners, the private \r\nsector, religious bodies and the youthful generation.\r\nWe must aspire to deliver tangible outcomes in \r\nall countries and to be all-inclusive in participation, \r\ndesign, decision-making and implementation and in \r\nthe gains derived from them. Each country must take \r\nthe reins and drive its own pursuits befitting their own \r\ncircumstances and capabilities. The United Nations \r\nand our universal goals are only as effective as the sum \r\nof all our positive national and regional actions put \r\ntogether. What we do for our own people is what makes \r\nthe difference. The success of the United Nations is \r\nours to create.\r\nAs a least developed country and one of the smallest \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS), Tuvalu is fully \r\naware of its responsibilities under Agenda 2030, as it \r\nwas also with the MDGs. We are planning to host a \r\nnational summit to help develop our next development \r\nplan in November. Our national priorities, along with \r\nour framework for pacific regionalism, will be aligned \r\nto the interregional agenda of the SIDS Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action Pathway and mainstreamed into \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nOur small islands face multiple structural constraints \r\nand vulnerabilities. Sea-level rise continues to inundate \r\nmany of our small island coastlines and inundate our \r\nfood plantations. That is a security issue, an urgent \r\nand intergenerational one. It is an existential issue for \r\nTuvalu and other Pacific countries, and also bigger \r\npopulated countries in the f lood plains, and will \r\ndisplace many people. While many of our citizens \r\nare opting to migrate on their own terms because of \r\nexistential issues, migration does not solve global \r\nwarming, and the United Nations does not identify \r\nclimate change migrants as refugees. That is a dilemma \r\nfor us in Tuvalu.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda will be meaningless to many \r\nof us low-lying SIDS if a credible climate change \r\nagreement in Paris in December is not ambitious \r\nand action-oriented. The Paris agreement therefore \r\nmust reduce greenhouse gas emissions and keep the \r\nglobal average temperature rise to below 1.5° Celsius; \r\nrecognize that climate change is a human right issue \r\nfor Tuvaluans and many other millions and is an urgent \r\nsecurity and existential issue; be committed to a low-\r\ncarbon future; include a loss and damage architecture to \r\nrecognize that preventing climate change is a national \r\nobligation for those who pollute, and the polluters must \r\nreduce emissions or pay to clean, mitigate and aid \r\nthose most vulnerable and without the means to adapt; \r\nprovide credible, timely public finance and clarity from \r\ndeveloped countries to the pledges of $100 billion for \r\nclimate change finances; and it must be reassuring \r\nfor the private sector to transition and invest in clear \r\nenergy and climate-resilient approaches.\r\n22/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nTuvalu will submit its intended nationally \r\ndetermined contributions. We must all note that our \r\nobligation is not only to submit those contributions, but \r\nalso to ensure that we achieve those set targets. There \r\nmust be no backsliding. We must have a good review \r\nmechanism to gauge whether cumulatively we are \r\nreducing emissions and not increasing them.\r\nThe increasing unease from destabilizing conflicts, \r\nviolence, malicious brutality and related impunity \r\nthroughout the globe is worrisome. We have to provide \r\nhope and leadership to find lasting peace. We welcome \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General on the future of the \r\nUnited Nations peace operations (see A/70/95), which \r\ncalls for change and reform, and the Secretary-General’s \r\nplan of action to promote tolerance and reconciliation \r\nand counter violent extremism.\r\nTuvalu also welcomes the adoption by consensus \r\nof a text to advance the negotiation of reforms to the \r\nSecurity Council. The adopted resolution is long \r\noverdue giving much needed impetus to the recycling \r\nof known positions and statements repeated in the \r\nforegoing 23 years. We must advance with a Security \r\nCouncil that is more representative of a membership \r\nand a world with more nuanced and ominous security-\r\nrelated issues.\r\nRecent global social and economic tensions and \r\nmarket jitters remind us that we are of course not \r\nimmune to a repeat of the global financial crisis. The \r\ncost and prolonged painful recovery, even in the far \r\nremote small economies like Tuvalu, are still vivid in our \r\nmemories. The new SDGs framework must ensure that \r\naccountability measures are elaborated and enforced, \r\nespecially for the rich echelons that are untouchable \r\nand ignorant of the far-reaching repercussions of their \r\ngreed, especially to small genuine investors.\r\nAs custodians of the Pacific Ocean, Tuvalu fully \r\nsupports SDG 14. We are all oceanic States as our \r\nplanet and Mother Earth is more than 70 per cent blue. \r\nThe blue ocean is not a sink for radioactive spillovers \r\nof nuclear wastes. It is not a dump for industrial and \r\ngeneral garbage. It is not a carpet to sweep and hide our \r\ndirt under. We from the islands have a warning for our \r\nSDGs. Without a healthy ocean it would be a challenge \r\nto achieve many other sustainable goals. Do not give \r\na man a fish to satisfy his hunger just for a day, give \r\na whole generation a healthy ocean and all succeeding \r\ngenerations will be satisfied for eternity.\r\nThe successful implementation and outreach of the \r\nSecretary-General’s sustainable energy for all will be \r\na vital undertaking of the 2030 Agenda. Clean energy \r\nundergirds and empowers most other SDGs. We must \r\ncooperate in a shared quest for a smooth transition from \r\nfossil fuel to renewable alternatives and to ensuring \r\nthat energy security, accessibility and affordability is \r\napplied holistically.\r\nWe look forward to the smooth transfer of \r\ntechnology and technical skills, the development of the \r\ntechnology bank and data and capacity-building that is \r\ntailored to each country’s unique situation and context. \r\nWe would appreciate the facilitation of the means of \r\nimplementation and finance as discussed in the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda.\r\nFor vulnerable LDCs and SIDS, the timely \r\noperationalization and mobilization of the Green Climate \r\nFund, with minimal bureaucracy, will be most welcome. \r\nBut as much as we need capacity enhancement, science, \r\ndata and new technology, we must match this with \r\nleadership integrity. The recent papal encyclical of His \r\nHoliness Pope Francis agrees that our leadership roles \r\nmust be free of political wrangling, power squabbling, \r\nconflicts, trade imbalances, bad governance, race and \r\ngender differentiation, self-interests, greed and profit-\r\nonly mentality and ignorance of nature’s deterioration.\r\nWe the people need SDGs championed by good \r\naccountable leaders. In Tuvalu we have conducted \r\nleadership seminars for our parliamentarians and \r\napproved a leadership code for all in leadership positions \r\nnationwide. The independent Office of the Ombudsman \r\nis now fully engaged in its responsibilities.\r\nMonitoring and reviewing our progress on the \r\nSDGs throughout the next 15 years is vital to sustain \r\nand focus our transformative agenda per country. The \r\nrole of the High-level Political Forum will therefore \r\nbe critical to respond to the changing and evolving \r\ncircumstances of each member and region, ensuring \r\nthat Agenda 2030 is adding value, effective and fit for \r\npurpose.\r\nThe graduation criteria for least developed countries \r\nand their application require proper scrutiny and review, \r\nas they are biased towards statistical calculations rather \r\nthan SIDS vulnerable realities. Tuvalu will forever \r\nbe a small island developing State, with constrained \r\noptions for productivity, trade and economies of scale. \r\nIn fact, we are losing land because of sea-level rise. Our \r\neconomic and social and environmental vulnerabilities \r\n15-29822 23/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nare intrinsically interlocked. They cannot be perused \r\nanalytically in silos when computing graduation \r\ncriteria.\r\nEarly in March, Tropical Cyclone Pam devastated \r\nVanuatu, Tuvalu, Kiribati and Solomon Islands. \r\nGiven Tuvalu’s low elevation and small size, the \r\ndevastation was significant, further confirming our \r\nhigh vulnerability to the increasing occurrences and \r\nseverity of natural disasters. A high-level dialogue on \r\nTropical Cyclone Pam was held with our development \r\npartners last July in Funafuti to seek assistance for an \r\nAustralian $92 million bill for the recovery efforts. \r\nWe have also submitted a comprehensive project to the \r\nGreen Climate Fund to better safeguard and protect our \r\npeople, land and infrastructure in the long term when \r\nsuch disasters revisit in future.\r\nWe applaud the thawing of tensions between close \r\nneighbours the United States of America and Cuba. \r\nWe sincerely hope that the embargo against Cuba will \r\nbe lifted soon, and for continued dialogue, smooth \r\ntransition and a resumption of economic partnerships \r\nin the near future. We thank the Government of Cuba \r\nfor offering scholarships to many SIDS and developing \r\ncountries in the health sector, despite their economic \r\nrestraints because of the embargo. This year eight \r\nTuvaluan medical doctors graduated from Cuba. That \r\nspirit of cooperation gives the Charter of the United \r\nNations Charter real meaning and value.\r\nTuvalu also welcomes the efforts of the Government \r\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan in fostering peace and \r\nprosperity in the region and globally. The Government \r\nand non-governmental organizations of Taiwan have \r\nconsistently supported various developmental and \r\nhumanitarian undertakings directly and through many \r\nspecialized United Nations bodies, such as the World \r\nHealth Assembly, the World Health Organization, \r\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization and the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. Taiwan’s infrastructure projects, technology \r\ntransfer and capacity-building have produced genuine \r\nand tangible outcomes in Tuvalu. We can achieve the \r\nambitious goals we have set ourselves in Agenda 2030 \r\nonly if all the permutations of partnerships are utilized \r\nand honoured.\r\nFinally, Tuvalu pledges its full support for the new \r\nAgenda “Transforming Our World: the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development” and for the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session, under the theme of \r\nthe general debate, that is, “The United Nations at 70: \r\na new commitment to action”. Let us work together to \r\ncreate a future that is accommodating to the total human \r\nrace, and to heal and secure our planet for successive \r\ngenerations. If we are ambitious in all our 17 SDGs, let \r\nus not be any less ambitious with Goal 13 in Paris.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Denis Moses, Minister for \r\nForeign and Caribbean Community Affairs of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago.\r\nMr. Moses (Trinidad and Tobago): It is a signal \r\nhonour for me to address this body and to extend to the \r\nPresident on behalf of the Government and people of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago congratulations \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventieth session. We also express our appreciation \r\nto his predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa of \r\nUganda, for the many productive initiatives that he \r\npursued to good effect during his tenure.\r\nThe President has assumed the mantle of leadership \r\nof this body at a critical juncture in the life of the \r\nOrganization. Now is an opportune moment to reaffirm \r\nits founders’ guiding vision as enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and to rededicate ourselves to \r\nbe faithful in our joint pursuit of the goals of peace, \r\nsecurity, development and human rights.\r\nBut, as we assess the performance and impact of \r\nthe United Nations, we must also look ahead to the next \r\nphase in the life of this unique Organization, given the \r\nmany challenges that confront human civilization in \r\ngeneral and the international community in particular. \r\nConsequently, Trinidad and Tobago considers the \r\ntheme of this session — “The United Nations at 70: the \r\nroad ahead for peace, security and human rights” — to \r\nbe both most fitting and timely.\r\nA few days ago in this very Hall, Member States \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nthe overarching framework that will guide global \r\ndevelopment for the next 15 years. Trinidad and Tobago \r\nechoes the words of the Secretary-General that the \r\n2030 Agenda encompasses a universal, transformative \r\nand integrated agenda that heralds a historic turning \r\npoint for our world. The adoption of this landmark \r\nagreement is testament to the triumph, and indeed the \r\npower and possibilities, of multilateralism, especially \r\nas it emphasizes a people’s agenda, with the promise \r\nof leaving no one behind. This ambitious and inclusive \r\nAgenda must not be lost in lofty rhetoric.\r\n24/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nThe United Nations has as its main purposes to \r\nmaintain international peace and security, to promote \r\nand protect human rights and to effectively address \r\npressing international economic and social issues, such \r\nas development, through international cooperation.\r\nAlthough in the aftermath of the Second World War \r\nthe United Nations has succeeded in preventing another \r\nglobal war, peace still remains elusive in some parts \r\nof the world. Conflicts and tensions adversely affect \r\ncountries and regions well beyond their immediate place \r\nof origin, whether through forced migration, disruption \r\nof basic public services such as health, education and \r\nsanitation or through rendering impossible the normal \r\nconduct of business activity.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is a strong advocate for the \r\nreform of the Security Council to better enable that body \r\nto respond to the various security and other challenges \r\nthat currently confront the international community. \r\nThis is especially so having regard to the fact that, \r\nin the contemporary world, warfare is no longer the \r\nexclusive preserve of nation States. Other actors, \r\nwith pernicious designs, have acquired the capability \r\nto threaten States and to carry out dastardly deeds \r\ncalculated to intimidate, and continue to pose serious \r\nthreats to international peace and security. The United \r\nNations must therefore respond with alacrity to those \r\nthreats in a manner that is acceptable to all Member \r\nStates. That is achievable if the Security Council is \r\nreformed to genuinely reflect the diversity that today \r\ncharacterizes and embodies the United Nations.\r\nFor small States such as Trinidad and Tobago, the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security is of \r\nparamount importance. We are keenly aware that our \r\nprospects for achieving sustainable development are \r\ninextricably linked to the safety and security of our \r\npeople. However, our ability to provide such safety \r\nand security is increasingly being stretched, given \r\nthat Trinidad and Tobago is located in a region heavily \r\nimpacted by the trafficking of small arms and light \r\nweapons, as well as its attendant ills.\r\nThis illicit trade is transboundary in nature \r\nand is largely associated with the drug trade and \r\nits international criminal networks. Consequently, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago and the Caribbean Community \r\nfully subscribe to the aims and objectives of the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty as a critical vehicle to address the scourge \r\nof the illicit arms trade. We do so because we understand \r\nall too well that the continued presence of this menace \r\nin our region can, if left unchecked, undermine our \r\npeace and security and limit our progress towards \r\nsustainable development.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago recognizes that as we \r\ncelebrate the seventieth anniversary of the creation of \r\nthe United Nations, the international community still \r\ngrapples with the goal of the total elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons. Trinidad and Tobago and the other members \r\nof the Caribbean Community join with the countries of \r\nLatin America in celebrating our common commitment \r\nto denuclearization through the establishment of our \r\nregion as the first nuclear-free zone in the world. \r\nThe disastrous humanitarian consequences of the \r\nuse of the nuclear option today for a large number of \r\npeople from diverse regions of the world could result \r\nin widespread suffering, dislocation of populations \r\nand increased migration, thus undermining the peace, \r\nsecurity and development of many countries and \r\nregions. This reality should chasten all peoples, and \r\nespecially the leaders of countries possessing such \r\nweapons.\r\nAccordingly, we welcome the nuclear deal \r\nnegotiated by the United States, its partners and the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran. We wish to congratulate all \r\nthe parties involved on the tenacity and patience they \r\ndemonstrated in that complex and demanding process, \r\nand challenge both sides to honour their commitments.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda would not be fully implemented if \r\nthe most vulnerable members of our societies — women, \r\nchildren, persons with disabilities and indigenous \r\npeoples — are not placed at the very centre of the \r\ndevelopment paradigm. Regrettably, in some parts of \r\nthe world, women and children continue to be denied \r\nfundamental human rights and freedoms, receive less \r\npay for equal work as men and are systematically \r\nprevented from obtaining an education, all of which \r\nhinder their ability to participate in the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of their countries.\r\nSince its independence, in 1962, Trinidad and \r\nTobago has enacted several laws and administrative \r\nand other measures to promote and strengthen the \r\ngeneral well-being of women and girls in society. On \r\nthe international plane, we have committed to the full \r\nand effective implementation of our obligations under \r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women and the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child.\r\n15-29822 25/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nAdditionally, recognizing the progressive \r\ncontribution of women to peace and development, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago has since 2010 introduced, and \r\nbeen the main sponsor of, the General Assembly \r\nresolution on women, disarmament, non-proliferation \r\nand arms control since the year 2010.\r\nOur commitment to the safety and security of \r\nour citizens remains undiminished, and as we move \r\nforward it is the intention of the Government of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago to adopt a ‘whole of Government’ \r\napproach to national security, in which all ministries \r\nand national agencies will share responsibility and \r\nwill be accountable for the safety of the State. To \r\npromote such an integrated and resilient approach to \r\nnational security and to contribute to the attainment of \r\nsustainable development in line with the Government’s \r\nstrategic vision for developed country status by 2030, \r\nthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago will actively \r\npursue mechanisms to strengthen national capacities to \r\nreduce risk and to build community resilience to threats \r\nto national security.\r\nWhile time will not allow for a thorough review of \r\nour strategy, permit me to share some of the measures \r\ntargeted for implementation: the development of an \r\nadaptable defence and security posture to ensure \r\nthat the traditional role of the military is integrated \r\nwith new roles to ensure the security of the State; \r\nthe establishment of a joint border protection agency; \r\nthe adoption of an intelligence-led national security \r\narchitecture; and the enhancement of our disaster risk \r\nmanagement capability policy.\r\nThe international community now accepts that \r\nclimate change is a threat to our very existence. We need \r\nto be mindful, however, that this threat to humankind \r\nrecognizes no boundaries, cannot be contained through \r\nhigh-level diplomatic talks and mediation and will \r\nweigh heavily upon developing countries, particularly \r\nsmall island developing States and least developed \r\ncountries, thereby crippling their ability to react to \r\nexternal shocks to their social, economic and natural \r\nsystems.\r\nLike many other small island developing States, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago is at high risk of being severely \r\naffected by the devastating effects of climate change, \r\nand has therefore made mitigation measures a national \r\npriority, within the practical constraints of its limited \r\nfinancial capability. We recently witnessed the \r\ndestructive effects of Tropical Storm Erika on our \r\nfellow Caribbean State member, the Commonwealth \r\nof Dominica, which has set back that country’s \r\ndevelopment by many years.\r\nIt is undeniable, therefore, that climate change \r\nand development are closely interlinked. Recognizing \r\nthe need for bold and responsible action on the part \r\nof all Governments, albeit on the basis of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibility, Trinidad and Tobago \r\nhas adopted a proactive posture and has submitted its \r\nintended nationally determined contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange ahead of the 2015 Paris Climate Change \r\nConference. It is our expectation, in conformity with \r\nthat of the Caribbean Community, that any credible \r\nagreement from the Paris Conference must set the \r\nworld on a path to decarbonization of the global \r\neconomy before the end of the century. In order to \r\nachieve that, the agreement must be legally binding and \r\ncontain provisions on mitigation, adaptation, finance, \r\ntransparency and compliance that would ensure that the \r\nincrease in average global temperatures can be limited \r\nto less than l.5° Celsius above pre-industrial levels. \r\nAn ambitious agreement in Paris is therefore also an \r\nimperative for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security in the medium to long term. Trinidad and \r\nTobago is committed to work with all States to achieve \r\na new legally binding balanced framework for global \r\ncooperation on climate change.\r\nIn the area of governance of the oceans, it is well \r\nestablished in international law that the utilization \r\nof resources of any kind beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction must be consistent with the principles \r\nunder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea. In that regard, Trinidad and Tobago looks forward \r\nto active participation by all States in the Preparatory \r\nCommittee on the development of an international \r\nlegally binding instrument on the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity beyond \r\nareas of national jurisdiction, for the benefit of all \r\nhumankind.\r\nThe quest for economic and social justice for many \r\ncannot be divorced from the fervent desire of all peoples \r\nto live in freedom and without fear of persecution. In \r\nthat regard, the growing religious and ethnic diversity \r\nof our societies highlights the ever-present need \r\nfor mutual respect and appreciation for the value of \r\ndiversity that today is a defining characteristic of many \r\ncountries and communities. A lack of such tolerance \r\nand respect for human rights and human diversity has \r\n26/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\nfuelled once again in our lifetime the horrific crimes \r\nof genocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes \r\nand crimes of aggression. With a view to ensuring \r\naccountability for those accused of committing such \r\ncrimes, and in order to act as a deterrent to would-be \r\nperpetrators, the international community established \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC). Trinidad and \r\nTobago calls upon all States that have not as yet done so \r\nto support the ICC.\r\nWe applaud the initiation of steps towards full \r\nrapprochement between the United States and Cuba, \r\nwhich has so far, among other things, been exemplified \r\nthrough the re-establishment of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween the two States, thus reducing tensions in our \r\nhemisphere. Trinidad and Tobago hopes that, sooner \r\nrather than later, that process will mature with the \r\nlifting of the anachronistic economic embargo and \r\nblockade that for too long has undermined the economic \r\ndevelopment of Cuba.\r\nWhile we are very much encouraged by the \r\neasing of tensions in the northern Caribbean with the \r\nresumption of dialogue between the United States and \r\nCuba, we are concerned by the recent developments \r\nsurrounding the protracted border controversy between \r\nour neighbours, Venezuela and Guyana. Trinidad and \r\nTobago remains convinced that the controversy should \r\nbe settled by pacific means in keeping with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAt the same time, Trinidad and Tobago reiterates \r\nthe position of the Caribbean Community on the matter \r\nconcerning citizens of the Dominican Republic of \r\nHaitian ancestry and calls on the Dominican Republic \r\nto ensure that the human rights of these citizens do not \r\ncontinue to be infringed and are honoured in accordance \r\nwith international law.\r\nOnce again, the failure to find a permanent solution \r\nto the Israeli/Palestinian conflict remains of deep \r\nconcern to Trinidad and Tobago. That situation affects \r\nthe ability of both sides to live in peace and security \r\nand also impinges on the right of the Palestinians to \r\nself-determination. It is our hope that both sides will \r\nwork together with others in resolving this decades-old \r\nproblem, resulting in the establishment of a Palestinian \r\nState with clearly defined borders, coexisting in peace \r\nand security alongside the State of Israel.\r\nThe United Nations must adapt to the ever-changing \r\ngeopolitical environment as well as the emerging \r\neconomic and social landscape. Trinidad and Tobago \r\ntherefore emphasizes the imperative to move with \r\ngreater alacrity on the question of the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly in order to ensure the effective \r\nexecution of its mandate. The General Assembly is the \r\nonly institution or grouping of States that possesses \r\nthe inclusiveness, and indeed the legitimacy, to act \r\non behalf of the international community. We must \r\ntherefore spare no effort to make it a more effective and \r\ndynamic instrument in the service of all the peoples of \r\nthe world, elevating none about others and respecting \r\nand defending the rights of all.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago commits to continue to play \r\nits part at the regional and global levels to ensure that \r\nwe avoid the pitfalls experienced by the United Nations. \r\nWe will work faithfully with others to build on the \r\ntremendous progress made by this institution over the \r\nseven decades of its life in order to bring about a greater \r\ncommitment by all States to peace, security and human \r\nrights for all peoples of the world so that they may live \r\nin larger freedom and continuing prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Alva Romanus Baptiste, \r\nMinister for External Affairs, International Trade and \r\nCivil Aviation of Saint Lucia.\r\nMr. Baptiste (Saint Lucia): As I address this \r\nhistoric seventieth session of the General Assembly, I \r\njoin in the chorus of congratulations to the President \r\non assuming the high honour and Office of President \r\nof the General Assembly. Please permit me to take this \r\nopportunity to wish him a successful tenure, which I am \r\nsure will be guaranteed by his experience as Speaker of \r\nthe Parliament of Denmark.\r\nIt has been 70 years since this great vessel of peace \r\ntook f light following the atomic destruction of the \r\nSecond World War. At that time, people throughout the \r\nplanet were of one mind that the pursuit of peace was \r\nthe supreme objective. For 70 years we have grappled \r\nwith our mission in the midst of war and conflict and \r\nsometimes we have even questioned our effectiveness.\r\nFor 70 years we have been coming to the General \r\nAssembly to deliver statements of glorious intention, \r\nonly to be disappointed by inaction or adverse \r\ndecisions. After 70 years the time has come to confront \r\nour collective conscience and reconcile our words with \r\nour actions. As we subject ourselves and the global \r\nOrganization to new levels of critical examination we \r\nmust answer the question: are we still on course to \r\nsecuring a world of peace or are we evading the urgent \r\n15-29822 27/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\ncourse of duty which calls upon us to act with wisdom, \r\nhumility and love for humankind?\r\nWe must also focus on what we have achieved \r\nand the work that we need to do, now and in the \r\nfuture. As we engage in this process of introspection \r\nand reflection, we must seize the opportunity for \r\nrededication and regeneration for the United Nations to \r\ncontinue addressing the increasingly complex issues of \r\nhuman survival.\r\nThe President has assumed office at a time of \r\ntremendous trial for many people throughout the world. \r\nToday many of our Middle Eastern brothers and sisters \r\nin Iraq, Libya, Syria and elsewhere find their lives \r\ntransformed by graphic experiences of disturbance, \r\npersonal trauma and, in some instances, much physical \r\nand mental pain. That is a human tragedy of unthinkable \r\nproportions, and the people of Saint Lucia and other \r\nsmall countries look on in near disbelief at the huge \r\nexodus of people from those previously prosperous \r\ncountries.\r\nSuddenly, the leaders and peoples of the European \r\ncountries to which those migrants on the move have \r\nsought refuge find themselves gripped by surprise and \r\nconcern as they search to find the correct reaction to \r\nthis humanitarian crisis. We can well understand the \r\ndilemma faced by receiving countries, which have to \r\nbalance their particular national interests against their \r\nwider global responsibility. They know that the more \r\nnew immigrants they accept, the more they will have \r\nto accept as others desperate to escape those situations \r\nof suffering and trauma flock to friendlier fraternal \r\nnations.\r\nWe note that this huge migration f low is towards \r\nEurope, some of whose countries border or face the \r\nMiddle East zone. Although we are geographically far \r\naway from the crisis, the human suffering burns our \r\ncollective Caribbean heart. And even as we see the \r\ninevitability of Europe’s responsibility to bear the brunt \r\nof this tragedy, we recognize the long history of the \r\ninterplay between Europe and the Middle East.\r\nAs we see and hear some in Europe express \r\nconcern about the magnitude of the challenge, we want \r\nto encourage and assure them that the right thing can \r\nand must be done. Smaller and poorer nations have \r\ndemonstrated a humanity and generosity that has made \r\na big difference whenever and wherever they assisted.\r\nIn the Caribbean we offer the example of Cuba, \r\nwhich despite being saddled with a United States \r\neconomic embargo for more than 50 years has been \r\nable to provide scholarships to train thousands of \r\nprofessionals from the Caribbean and Latin America \r\nevery year. In addition, Cuba’s support in combating \r\nvarious medical epidemics throughout the world, \r\nincluding the recent Ebola crisis in Africa, has been \r\nexemplary and legendary. Therefore Europe, despite \r\nthe magnitude of the challenge, as a group of powerful \r\ncountries can respond effectively within the framework \r\nof its integrated whole and be comforted and inspired \r\nby the example of Cuba.\r\nAs a global community our interests cannot be \r\nserved in the morbid scenario of conflict and war. It is \r\nin that context that Saint Lucia extends commendation \r\nto both the United States Administration and the \r\nGovernment of Iran for working out a diplomatic \r\nsolution that will manage the nuclear threat in the \r\nregion for the next 15 years. That is certainly in keeping \r\nwith the peacebuilding mission of the United Nations. \r\nThis approach will not only lead to a general lessening \r\nof tension but may set the stage for the West and the \r\nMiddle East to work out a rational and convincing \r\nstrategy to tackle the root causes of conflict in that \r\narea, thereby re-establishing peace and tranquillity in \r\nthat part of the world.\r\nIn that connection, Saint Lucia appeals for a \r\nsimilar approach to the continuing Israeli/Palestinian \r\nconflict, one that will result in the resolution of \r\nthat longstanding issue. In our seventieth year, we \r\nmust assert the supremacy of international law and \r\ndiplomacy. Resolution 181, of 29 November 1947, calls \r\nfor the establishment of both the State of Israel and \r\nthat of Palestine. My country reiterates its call for the \r\nrecognition of the statehood of Palestine and its full \r\nmembership of the Organization.\r\nClearly, a powerful byproduct of conflict and war \r\nis the displacement of people — physically, socially and \r\neconomically. Nonetheless, Saint Lucia and other small \r\nStates expect that present events will reinforce the \r\nnotion that we now live in one world where your troubles \r\nare mine and my troubles are yours, and that there will \r\nbe a greater concern to have problems resolved through \r\ngenuine diplomatic engagement rather than through the \r\nforce of power.\r\nCountries like my own are acutely aware that the \r\nproblems of others far away throughout the world can \r\n28/29 15-29822\r\nA/70/PV.26 02/10/2015\r\neasily wash on to our shores. We are very mindful, \r\ntherefore, that even when we do not feel directly \r\nimpacted there is the very real possibility that the \r\nconsequences may spill over into our region. We have \r\noften experienced that through the volatile prices of oil \r\nand petroleum products. It has also been spurred by \r\npolitical turmoil and financial disturbances in far off \r\nregions but which often have a substantial impact upon \r\nour own plans for development and economic progress. \r\nThe theatre of war is also present in our region.\r\nFrom an economic perspective, small States like \r\nSaint Lucia are literally terrorized by the constant \r\nattacks of the rich and powerful on any economic \r\nadvances by the poor and powerless, which place our \r\nfuture in persistent peril. How can we be expected \r\nto be stable and secure if our vulnerabilities as small \r\nisland developing States are constantly ignored and \r\noverlooked? How is our war on poverty supposed \r\nto succeed and be sustained if at every turn it is \r\nsystematically undermined by the regressive imposition \r\nof policies by the international community, whether in \r\nthe form of illogical economic graduation, insensitive \r\nerosion of trade preferences or inexplicable black \r\nlisting of our financial jurisdictions?\r\nThis geographic and economic insecurity has \r\nbecome the central source of domestic instability. To \r\nincrease the specific gravity of our economic problems, \r\nfrom an environmental standpoint small States like \r\nSaint Lucia face growing insecurity as climate change \r\nunleashes increasingly deadly and destructive disasters \r\nupon us. We are now all aware of the recent devastation \r\nof Dominica by Tropical Storm Erika, which caused \r\ndamage amounting to almost 100 per cent of its gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP). As I speak now, Joaquin \r\ncontinues its decimating march across the economic \r\nand environmental fabric of the Bahamas. These two \r\nmost recent examples, only weeks apart, are vivid \r\ntestimony to the ferocity of the threats that confront us.\r\nIn addition, small States like my own find ourselves \r\ntoday trapped in a situation where the erosion of trade \r\npreferences and a decline in official development \r\nassistance and foreign direct investment have caused \r\nus to engage in increased borrowing to meet our \r\ncurrent social and economic obligations resulting in \r\nhigh debt to GDP ratios. That has narrowed the room \r\nfor fiscal policy f lexibility and fiscal manoeuvring. \r\nThis is further compounded by the increased security \r\ncosts of responding to the negative impacts of the illicit \r\ntrade in small arms and illegal narcotics, as well as \r\nreconstruction costs following natural disasters. \r\nThe new global partnership for sustainable \r\neconomic and social development provides a platform \r\nfrom which to tackle human security in all its facets. \r\nWe firmly support theinternational community \r\nconsistently working to minimize the causes of global \r\nand regional insecurity.\r\nIn that vein, 2015 provides a once-in-a-generation \r\nopportunity to set a transformational global agenda \r\nfor sustainable development. The quartet of global \r\nagreements forged towards that end — on disaster \r\nrisk reduction, financing for development, the post-\r\n2015 development agenda and the new climate change \r\nagreement yet to be finalized — are intended to usher \r\nin a new era of sustainable development for all. The \r\nadoption of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals \r\nsuggests that we have progressed our understanding of \r\nthe profound challenges that face developing countries. \r\nHowever, the economic, social and environmental \r\nsecurity of small island developing States like my \r\nown rests in the effective implementation of these \r\nagreements.\r\nSmall countries like Saint Lucia can hardly \r\nwithstand externally induced insecurity. We require for \r\nour development a context of regional and international \r\nharmony, which is dependent on linkages far from \r\nour immediate environments. So there is substantial \r\nconcern that small States with limited material or \r\ndiplomatic outreach do not have access to arrangements \r\nthat allow them to speedily draw support from outside \r\nto inhibit or minimize environmental insecurity.\r\nThe major countries of the globe, and indeed the \r\nmembers of the Security Council, would no doubt be \r\nsensitive to the issues of insecurity. But what small \r\ncountries have always known, and larger Powers are \r\nnow beginning to recognize, is that harmful events \r\nin particular sections of the globe have the potential \r\nto affect and draw in all of us as members of today’s \r\nintegrated global system.\r\nSaint Lucia maintains its position that expansion \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nof membership of the Security Council is imperative \r\nto better reflect the contemporary world realities \r\nand achieve a more accountable, representative, \r\ntransparent — and more important— relevant Security \r\nCouncil. We applaud what we have achieved during \r\nthe past year by moving the process now to text-based \r\n15-29822 29/29\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.26\r\nnegotiations, and look forward to the realization of that \r\nprocess.\r\nIn Saint Lucia, and in the other members of the \r\nWestern Hemisphere, there is a general sense of relief \r\nand welcome at the diplomatic reconciliation that has \r\nbeen taking place between the United States and the \r\nRepublic of Cuba. The Government of Saint Lucia \r\nbelieves that this initiative opens the way to a full-scale \r\nreconciliation of hemispheric relations. It removes \r\nunnecessary impediments to our efforts at regional and \r\nhemispheric cooperation. It consolidates the channels \r\nthat are necessary for pursuing viable paths of regional \r\neconomic integration, and it allows small countries \r\nlike Saint Lucia to utilize the scale of the regional \r\nplatform to initiate plans and processes that can be \r\nmutually beneficial in the Caribbean region and in the \r\nhemisphere as a whole.\r\nFurthermore, it is another indication of the removal \r\nof situations and stratagems that serve only to create \r\nsources of insecurity. We are firmly of the view \r\nthat countries in our hemisphere committed to this \r\nperspective now have an opportunity, on the basis of \r\nthe initiative taken by Pope Francis and by the President \r\nof the United States of America, to promote the path \r\nof peaceful resolution of disputes in full awareness of \r\nthe fact that national or regional conflicts are inhibitors \r\nto persistent economic growth and therefore social \r\nstability.\r\nThe normalization of relations within our \r\nhemisphere is also an indication that old conflicts and \r\ndisputes kept frigid by the era of the Cold War, are giving \r\nway to new avenues of cooperation and collaboration \r\namong countries. In addition, the post-world-war period \r\nhas begun to give way to new arrangements or efforts at \r\nreconciliation that permit peaceful relations in various \r\nparts of the world.\r\nThe Government of Saint Lucia, which has official \r\nrelations with the Government of the Republic of China \r\non Taiwan, notes the continuing interchange between \r\nthat State and the People’s Republic of China, which \r\nis defined in particular by the economic relations in \r\nwhich they are mutually involved. We believe tha,t as \r\nwe retain the status quo of accrediting recognition to \r\nTaiwan, it is not for us but for themselves to indicate \r\nthe appropriate template in the relations between the \r\ntwo countries.\r\nAs I prepare to bring my presentation to its logical \r\nconclusion, I want to return to a reflective mode on \r\nthe 70 years of the United Nations. There have been \r\nproblems, of course, but there have also been successes. \r\nIn the words of the late President John Fitzgerald \r\nKennedy “Let us not curse the remaining dark. Let us \r\ncontinue to gather the light.”\r\nThere will continue to be challenges and difficult \r\nissues that test the resolve of members, as well as those \r\ncited by many academics that are important to our \r\ninternational relations — for example, the resolution \r\nof national identity and self-determination issues; \r\nthe increasing importance of non-State actors; great \r\nPower involvement in the third world; the role of \r\nreligion in international politics; global militarization; \r\nand the perceived impotence of international law and \r\ninternational organizations such as the United Nations \r\nin dealing with very complicated forms of violent and \r\nnon-violent conflict resolution.\r\nBut we must continue to advance the principles of \r\nreasoned discussion, dialogue and discourse, and the \r\nunswerving pursuit of peace. In the 31 years between \r\n1914 and 1945, the world experienced two world wars, \r\nbut in the 70 years since the end of the Second World \r\nWar the United Nations has kept the world away from \r\nwidespread war.\r\nLet us work, hope and pray that we remain true to \r\nour peaceful character and that, even in the midst of \r\nprovocation, we seek to keep the world safe, projecting \r\nan orientation of enforcing peaceful relations and \r\nshedding no innocent blood. Therefore, from Saint \r\nLucia to the President I convey once again our warmest \r\ncongratulations as he guides our proceedings over the \r\nnext year.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.10 p.m.\r\n"
