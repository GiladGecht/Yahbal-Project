I also wish \r\nto greet each of the participants in today’s meeting and \r\nto express my hope that its work will prove fruitful \r\nand give new impetus to the commitment for creating \r\na world of peace and security, the respect for human \r\nrights and the promotion of the necessary conditions \r\nfor integral human development. Significantly, on \r\n24 October, we will celebrate the entry into force of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe recently concluded summit of the Heads \r\nof State and of Government adopted a plan of action \r\nfor the prosperity of peoples and the planet and for \r\nstrengthening peace in greater freedom. In the General \r\nAssembly’s adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), it has undertaken the \r\ntask of proposing a stable and sustainable pace for \r\nthe world economy. The Holy See can only express \r\nits satisfaction, as must the Governments that took \r\npart in the process of drawing up the new Agenda \r\nfor their citizens. In that regard, I wish to mention \r\nthat, even before the completion of the negotiations, \r\nPope Francis stated that the new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development is an important sign of hope \r\nfor humankind.\r\nIn contrast to the promising hopes generated \r\nby the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda (resolution 69/313, annex), adopted at the \r\nthird International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, there is the sad panorama of war. It is \r\nobvious that, unless conflicts are properly resolved, \r\nall efforts to overcome poverty will fail. The Holy \r\nSee is therefore seriously concerned about the global \r\nconsequences of conflicts; above all, it expresses deep \r\nregret for the countless victims of those wars and joins \r\nits voice to the plea of all those who suffer.\r\nWe must acknowledge that, over the past 70 years, \r\nthe United Nations has succeeded in avoiding a great \r\nglobal conflict and the outbreak of many wars between \r\nMember States. At the same time, it has also halted \r\nor resolved many regional conflicts and complex \r\ninstances of civil war. Nonetheless, there are at present \r\nat least 50 conflicts or situations of latent conflict, to \r\nsay nothing of the actions of international terrorist and \r\ncriminal organizations set up as quasi-States and as a \r\nsort of alternative international community. We have \r\nbefore us, unfortunately, the immense tragedy of the \r\nwar in Syria with its thousands of dead, its millions of \r\ndisplaced persons and its tremendous consequences for \r\nthe stability of the region.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.27\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n27th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 2 October 2015, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\nSimilarly, the troubles in Libya, Central Africa, the \r\nGreat Lakes region and South Sudan must remain at \r\nthe centre of the international community’s attention. \r\nNor can the tragic situation in Ukraine be overlooked \r\nor many other smaller or more contained conflicts, \r\nviolations of humanitarian law or the atypical warfare \r\nwaged by drug traffickers and other criminal groups. \r\nThen there is the grave conflict in the Middle East, \r\nwhich has been going on since the first years of the \r\nUnited Nations. That region, a cradle of civilizations, \r\nis immersed in a situation that combines every form \r\nof conflict and every possible subject — State and \r\nnon-State combatants, ethnic and cultural groups, \r\nterrorism, criminality and so on.\r\nThe atrocities and unspeakable human rights \r\nviolations that characterize today’s conflicts are \r\ntransmitted live by the media, and with wide diffusion \r\nand repetition they risk generating a numbing familiarity \r\nand indifference. The international community, for its \r\npart, must feel a grave responsibility to act resolutely \r\nand renew its political and juridical structures, so as \r\nto limit and overcome, as quickly and effectively as \r\npossible, the consequences of the current war-related \r\ncrises.\r\nIt is a bitter irony that the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations is accompanied by an exodus of \r\npeoples that is the greatest such migration seen since \r\nthat caused by the Second World War. Entire populations \r\nare being displaced, as they f lee from war, persecution, \r\nexploitation and poverty. Sadly, however, those waves \r\nof migrants are seen more in terms of the additional \r\nburden of unforeseen problems that they cause for the \r\ncountries of passage or destination than in terms of the \r\ncost of human life paid by millions of innocent people. \r\nFurthermore, as a response to such mass migrations, \r\nthe fear of terrorism and other local problems, there \r\nhas been a return to the practice of building walls and \r\nbarriers between peoples. That is a sad example of \r\ninhumanity, a hasty and ineffective solution to security \r\nand one that we thought the events of the late 1980s had \r\ndefinitively consigned to oblivion.\r\nAt the same time, the Holy See urgently appeals \r\nto States to overcome every form of nationalistic self-\r\ninterest and, above all, to recognize the unity of our \r\nhuman family and to have faith in the human person. \r\nDistant and more recent history teaches us that migrants, \r\neven in the most dramatic situations of displacement, \r\nhave always made a positive contribution to their host \r\ncountries. More importantly, however, the migrants are \r\nwomen and men who, by virtue of their humanity, are \r\nentitled to the universal rights to life and dignity.\r\nIn addition to offering hospitality, the present \r\ndramatic situation urgently demands a commitment to \r\naddress the causes that force peoples to f lee and thereby \r\nto take real, effective and generous decisions in favour \r\nof peace and integral human development. The solemn \r\ncommitment to implement the 2030 Agenda is more \r\ntimely than ever and must be advanced with courage. At \r\nthe same time, we must recognize that, without peace \r\nbetween peoples and nations, it will be impossible to \r\nimplement that Agenda.\r\nTo that end, the Holy See wishes to suggest four \r\nareas of reflection that should be borne in mind when \r\nconsidering the best possible course. They are the \r\nresponsibility to protect, the respect for international \r\nlaw, disarmament and the protection of the environment. \r\nThe first two, the responsibilities to protect and to \r\nobserve existing international law are to be considered \r\nnecessary instruments for discharging the immediate \r\nobligation to welcome exiles without putting up unjust \r\nbarriers for the universal enactment of the 2030 Agenda, \r\nand likewise for the protection of the environment. \r\nToday, the principle of the responsibility to \r\nprotect all peoples from massive atrocities, instances \r\nof genocide, war crimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes \r\nagainst humanity is recognized and accepted by all. \r\nThat responsibility, as has been noted, first obliges \r\nnational Governments, and then the international \r\ncommunity and regional groups of States, to act \r\nin accordance with international law. Yet it is not \r\nalways easy to carry out that duty in practice, not \r\nthe least because its observance often conflicts \r\nwith a strict literal interpretation of the principle of \r\nnon-intervention, as sanctioned by paragraph 7 of \r\nArticle 2 of the Charter of the United Nations. There \r\nis also the suspicion, historically founded, that under \r\nthe guise of humanitarian intervention, the principle of \r\nthe sovereign equality of the Members of the United \r\nNations, established in paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the \r\nCharter, could end up being overridden.\r\nNonetheless, owing to the unacceptable human \r\ncosts of inaction, the search for effective juridical \r\nmeans for the practical application of the principle of \r\nthe responsibility to protect must be one of the most \r\nurgent central priorities of the United Nations. To that \r\nend, it would be most useful if the Member States could \r\ndetermine clear and effective criteria for applying \r\n15-29940 3/18\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27\r\nthe principle and for the corresponding integration \r\nof Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nFurthermore, drawing on the significant experience of \r\nthe United Nations and various dependent agencies in \r\npeacekeeping, peacebuilding and other humanitarian \r\ninterventions, rapid and effective means should be \r\nfound for implementing eventual decisions relative to \r\nthe responsibility to protect.\r\nThe great purposes and principles expressed in the \r\nPreamble and in Article 1 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations serve as a sure guide to the interpretation \r\nand application of all successive provisions of the \r\nCharter. Therefore, the solemn duties spelled out in \r\nthe Preamble “to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war” and “to reaffirm faith in fundamental \r\nhuman rights, in the dignity and worth of the human \r\nperson” and in paragraph 3 of Article 1, to promote \r\nand encourage “respect for human rights and for \r\nfundamental freedom for all” not only justify the \r\nimplementation of the responsibility to protect, but also \r\nbind the international community in the duty to find the \r\nappropriate means to do so. Otherwise, the great edifice \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations would be reduced \r\nto a mere tool for maintaining global equilibrium and \r\nfor resolving controversies. That would betray not only \r\nthose who drafted the Charter, but also the millions of \r\nvictims whose blood was shed in the great wars of the \r\nlast century.\r\nThe second element that today’s conflicts, and the \r\nhumanitarian crises they cause, force us to consider \r\nis what we might call the responsibility to observe \r\nthe existing law in responding to global and regional \r\ncrises. That requires, first of all, a genuine and \r\ntransparent application of Article 2 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. The principle of non-intervention, \r\nsanctioned in paragraph 7 of that Article, together with \r\nparagraphs 3 and 4, excludes all unilateral use of force \r\nagainst another Member of the United Nations and \r\ndemands full respect for Governments that are lawfully \r\nconstituted and recognized.\r\nArticle 2 cannot, however, become an alibi for \r\nexcusing gross violations of human rights. The 70-\r\nyear experience of the United Nations has amply \r\ndemonstrated that grave violations of human dignity on \r\nthe part of Governments can be redressed and resolved \r\npeacefully through denunciation and persuasion by \r\ncivil society and Governments themselves. Where \r\ngross violations of human rights persist and further \r\nintervention is considered necessary, the only other \r\nrecourse is to apply the measures set forth in Chapters \r\nVI and VII of the Charter. In addition, adherence to \r\nthe Charter, as well as to the cardinal principle of \r\ninternational law, namely, pacta sunt servanda, which is \r\nno tautology but rather the affirmation of the rule of law \r\nitself, has definitively banned concepts such as that of \r\npreventive war and, even more so, attempts to redesign \r\nentire geographic areas and redistribute populations \r\nunder the pretext of a principle of security. At the same \r\ntime, the most evident and reasonable understanding of \r\nparagraph 4 of Article 2 of the Charter excludes any \r\nintervention by third-party States in favour of one side \r\nor another in a situation of civil conflict.\r\nA serious examination of conscience is needed, \r\nso that we can accept responsibility for the role that \r\ncertain unilateral interventions have played in the \r\nhumanitarian crisis that is causing so much hurt in our \r\nworld today. As Pope Francis recently said,\r\n“[W]e do not lack for hard evidence of the negative \r\nconsequences of military and political interventions \r\nundertaken without coordination among the \r\nmembers of the international community.” \r\n(A/70/PV.3, p. 5)\r\nThe current crisis calls us, therefore, to renew efforts to \r\napply the law that is in force and to develop new norms \r\nthat are also aimed at combating the phenomenon of \r\ninternational terrorism, in full respect for the law.\r\nMultilateral action for peace and collective \r\nsecurity can be effectively advanced with the help of \r\nanother instrument recognized by the Charter and often \r\nconsidered in the Assembly, namely, disarmament. \r\nHere, too, we find ourselves in an area of light and \r\nshadows, with the latter, unfortunately, prevailing. \r\nThere is the telling example of the failure in May of \r\nthe Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. In view \r\nof that impasse, it is all the more important that the \r\ninternational community and the individual States \r\nmost involved clearly signal a real desire to pursue the \r\nshared objective of a world free of nuclear arms, in full \r\napplication of the Treaty, in letter and spirit, with the \r\ngoal of a complete prohibition of such weapons.\r\nAs Pope Francis has noted in various forums, \r\nnuclear deterrence and the threat of mutually assured \r\ndestruction are irreconcilable with and contrary to an \r\nethic of fraternity and peaceful coexistence between \r\npeoples and between States. In the final analysis, \r\nthe nuclear arms race, and indeed the arms race in \r\n4/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\ngeneral, with its expenditure of human and economic \r\nresources, is based on a denial of the human dignity \r\nof one’s potential enemies and even the denial of one’s \r\nown dignity and survival. A process aimed at a deeper \r\nunderstanding of the grave humanitarian effects of the \r\nuse of weapons of mass destruction, and nuclear arms \r\nin particular, should therefore not only be encouraged \r\nbut should be considered necessary.\r\nWith regard to the humanitarian dimension, I \r\nshould also mention the Anti-Personnel Mine Ban \r\nConvention and the Convention on Cluster Munitions, \r\ntwo instruments for disarmament and for adapting \r\nhumanitarian law to the complexities of today’s world. \r\nThey are aimed at stigmatizing and banning those \r\ndreadful ordnances, which have such a devastating and \r\nindiscriminate impact on civilian populations. The Holy \r\nSee joins all those who are working for their effective \r\nimplementation in expressing the hope that they will \r\nsoon be signed by those States that have not yet done so.\r\nEffective and full enactment of the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations calls for replacing a \r\nmindset of thr rejection of others, of distrust and fear, \r\nwith an ethic of responsibility. That, too, demands that \r\nwe reflect on the meaning of the concept of collective \r\nsecurity, which has to do not only with war and military \r\nactions but also with broader economic, financial, \r\nethical, social and humanitarian dimensions.\r\nLooking ahead, we see another grave responsibility, \r\nboth for the effective implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda and for peace itself. That is the hoped-for \r\nagreement on climate change, which is to be adopted \r\nat the Paris Conference in December. The climate is \r\na global common good, a responsibility that we all \r\nbear, particularly towards the most vulnerable groups \r\nof present and future generations. It is a responsibility \r\nthat is necessarily transversal, requiring effective \r\nmultilateral and interdisciplinary cooperation on the \r\npart of individuals, based on their own abilities and \r\ncharacteristics, but united in the face of the challenging \r\nquestion as to the kind of world we want to leave to \r\nthose who come after us, to children who are now \r\ngrowing up.\r\nThe Paris Conference represents an important phase \r\nin the process of re-establishing a balance between \r\nglobal greenhouse-gas emissions and the Earth’s \r\ncapacity to absorb them. To that end, we urgently need \r\nto adopt a fair, transformational and legally binding \r\nglobal agreement. That would send a meaningful \r\nsignal to the entire international community, by \r\npromoting a rapid transition to development marked \r\nby a low carbon footprint and by providing a powerful \r\nimpetus to reinforcing the intrinsic link between \r\ntwo objectives — eradicating poverty and easing the \r\neffects of climate change. That link shows that the \r\nthreat of climate change and our responses to it can \r\nbe a promising opportunity for improving health, \r\ntransportation, energy security and new opportunities \r\nfor employment. An effective accord on those issues, in \r\naddition to the important value they possess in and of \r\nthemselves, can only contribute to general agreements \r\nbetween States regarding integral human development, \r\nthe responsibility to protect, peace, disarmament and \r\nrespect for international law.\r\nTo acknowledge the limitations of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations with regard to new crisis situations \r\nor, sadly, in the face of evidence of a failure to observe \r\nits prescriptions, is not the same thing as stating or \r\nlamenting the failure of the Organization itself. Such \r\nlimitations are rather the inevitable shadows of the \r\ngreat framework of the first global project for peace and \r\ninternational cooperation, which has, happily, endured \r\nfor 70 years and is an incentive to achieving full respect \r\nfor the law in force and to promoting greater trust and \r\ncooperation. The Holy See thus expresses the hope \r\nthat this seventieth anniversary, marked by the solemn \r\nadoption of the 2030 Agenda, may be the beginning of a \r\nharmonious and ever fuller cooperation for the benefit \r\nof all humankind.\r\nPope Benedict XVI, in 2008, and Pope Paul VI, \r\nduring his visit 50 years ago for the Organization’s \r\ntwentieth anniversary, both pointed out that the United \r\nNations is called increasingly to serve as a sign of unity \r\namong States and an instrument of service to the entire \r\nhuman family, and that, consequently, the Organization \r\nrepresents the obligatory path of modern civilization \r\nand world peace. The United Nations must, therefore, \r\nbecome a place where a true family of nations and \r\npeoples can meet and prosper, a place where all forms \r\nof war and unilateral intervention will be forever \r\nprohibited, not only in words, but above all in the spirit \r\nand intentions of every governmental authority.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the representative of the Socialist Republic of \r\nViet Nam.\r\nMrs. Nguyen Phuong Nga (Viet Nam): On behalf \r\nof the Vietnamese delegation, I would like to warmly \r\n15-29940 5/18\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27\r\ncongratulate Mr. Lykketoft upon his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. I believe that, with his wisdom and experience, \r\nhe will guide our session to a very successful outcome. \r\nMy delegation also applauds the important contributions \r\nmade by Mr. Sam Kutesa, President of the sixty-ninth \r\nsession, and Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, during \r\nthe past year.\r\nBorn from the ashes of the Second World War, \r\nthe United Nations has grown, during the past seven \r\ndecades, to embrace 193 States and has become the most \r\nrepresentative global organization and the true centre \r\nfor the coordination of global efforts to tackle common \r\nchallenges. As a beacon of hope, the United Nations has \r\nindeed helped make the world a better place by playing \r\nan increasingly important role in maintaining peace \r\nand security, in protecting and promoting human rights \r\nand in advancing development and progress.\r\nGuided by its Charter, the United Nations has \r\nworked to uphold the principles of respect for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of States and of \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other nations. \r\nThe Organization has promoted the non-use of force \r\nor of threats to use force in inter-State relations and \r\nhad provided guidance for peaceful and amicable \r\nrelations among nations, underlining, in particular, \r\nthe importance of mutual respect, good faith and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. It is in that spirit that \r\nwe welcome the recent progress made in addressing the \r\nIranian nuclear issue, which is a first step towards a \r\nlong-term solution that could bring peace, security and \r\nstability to the broader region. We also welcome the \r\nnormalization of relations between the United States \r\nand Cuba and call for the timely lifting of the embargoes \r\ncurrently imposed upon the brotherly Cuban people.\r\nWe can all look back on the past 70 years and the \r\naccomplishments of the United Nations with pride, \r\nbut we must also recognize what the Organization \r\nhas been unable to do and what challenges lie ahead. \r\nWars and conflicts have not been uncommon during \r\nthe past decades and still rage today. Terrorism, violent \r\nextremism, and religious and ethnic intolerance pose \r\nserious threats to regional and international peace and \r\nsecurity. Territorial and maritime disputes endanger \r\npeace and stability in many regions. Threats to the \r\nvery survival of humankind persist. Nuclear weapons \r\narsenals, though reduced, are still capable of destroying \r\nour home planet many times over. Climate change \r\nis threatening the livelihoods of billions of people \r\nand even the existence of many countries. Poverty \r\nremains one of the greatest challenges to sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Violence, discrimination, social injustice \r\nand humanitarian crises plague everyone’s enjoyment \r\nof their human rights.\r\nImmense challenges require equally immense \r\nefforts, and the United Nations must continue to play \r\na central role in those endeavours. Viet Nam welcomes \r\nthe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), which sets the vision and \r\ncreates the framework for all nations as they strive to \r\neliminate hunger and poverty, develop more sustainable \r\npatterns of production and consumption and work for \r\nthe improved preservation of our shared planet, which \r\nis faced with the threats of climate change and over-\r\nconsumption. The full and effective implementation \r\nof the new Agenda, with a global partnership at its \r\ncore, will address the deep-rooted causes of our \r\npresent problems and guide the world towards a more \r\nsustainable future. \r\nIn order to transform our world, the United Nations \r\nneeds to transform itself. The work of the General \r\nAssembly needs to be revitalized so as to make it more \r\nfocused, efficient and relevant. The Security Council \r\nneeds to be more representative, democratic, transparent \r\nand effective. The United Nations development system \r\nneeds to be strengthened. Institutional reforms must \r\ngo alongside substantive innovations, while ensuring a \r\nbalance among various aspects of the United Nations \r\nwork. Our experience with the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals has shown that peace \r\nand stability are the prerequisites for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In the words of the 2030 Agenda,\r\n“Sustainable development cannot be realized \r\nwithout peace and security, and peace and security \r\nwill be at risk without sustainable development” \r\n(resolution 70/1, para. 35).\r\nIt is therefore incumbent upon each and every \r\nState and the United Nations to do their utmost to \r\nensure peace and security at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels. Each State needs to act responsibly \r\nin accordance with the basic principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law. Regional \r\nand international organizations, with the United \r\nNations in the lead, also need to act accordingly and \r\nassist the States concerned to find amicable solutions \r\nto their differences and disputes by peaceful means, as \r\nprovided for in the Charter. Only by doing so, can we \r\n6/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\nhope for a future free from violence, the threat or use \r\nof force, intimidation, coercion and inequities, which \r\nwould create an enabling environment for our common \r\ndevelopment. At the same time, in order to succeed, \r\nsustainable development must truly be of the people, by \r\nthe people and for the people. In other words, the people \r\nmust be at the centre of the new Agenda, as the owners, \r\ndrivers and beneficiaries of all development efforts.\r\nAnd no agenda can succeed without a strong global \r\npartnership for sustainable development. Viet Nam \r\nhas always believed that domestic resources play the \r\ndecisive role in the development of any nation, but we \r\nalso believe that no individual country can do it alone. \r\nWe call on the developed countries to take the lead in \r\nassisting developing countries in the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, especially in the fields of financing, \r\ntechnology transfer and human resources development. \r\nWe also support and participate in South-South \r\ncooperation activities, which, we believe, provide an \r\neffective channel for sharing experience, technical \r\nsupport and capacity-building.\r\nLike the United Nations, Viet Nam is celebrating \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of its founding this year. \r\nImmediately after regaining its independence after \r\nnearly a century of colonialism, Viet Nam associated \r\nitself with the principles and values of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Our late President Ho Chi Minh, \r\nthe founder of modern Viet Nam, wrote on several \r\noccasions to world leaders to request recognition of the \r\nnew Viet Nam and its admission to the United Nations. \r\nAnd, since becoming a Member of the United Nation in \r\n1977, Viet Nam has always done its best to uphold the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter and contribute \r\nconstructively and responsibly to the work of the \r\nOrganization. \r\nViet Nam has always put people at the centre of \r\nall development strategies. Comprehensive human \r\ndevelopment encompasses physical and mental well-\r\nbeing, including human rights. Viet Nam has introduced \r\nlaws and policies to ensure that all of the human rights \r\nof its people, including economic, social, civil and \r\npolitical rights, are respected, protected and promoted. \r\nViet Nam is today party to seven out of the nine core \r\ninternational human rights treaties. It has most recently \r\njoined the Convention on the Rights of Persons with \r\nDisabilities.\r\nViet Nam is strongly committed to the successful \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. At the national level, we will mobilize \r\nall available resources, engage all relevant Government \r\nagencies and other stakeholders, and involve the people \r\nand their communities in that major undertaking. \r\nViet Nam pledges its support for the conclusion of a \r\nmeaningful agreement at the upcoming meeting of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change in Paris. For \r\nits part, Viet Nam has recently submitted its Intended \r\nNationally Determined Contributions.\r\nAt the regional level, we have joined efforts with \r\nour brothers and sisters of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to work towards strengthening \r\nthe ASEAN community. As an integral part of the \r\ndynamically growing Asia-Pacific region, ASEAN \r\nplays a crucial role in regional development. But for our \r\nregion to thrive, peace and stability must come first. It \r\nis therefore of vital importance that peace and stability \r\nbe maintained and that maritime safety and security \r\nand the freedom of navigation and overflight in the \r\nSouth China Sea be secured. Viet Nam is working \r\ntirelessly with other ASEAN members and all parties \r\nconcerned to that end, including by calling upon all \r\nparties to refrain from the threat or use of force and \r\nto settle all disputes by peaceful means in accordance \r\nwith international law, including the 1982 United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We are also \r\nengaging with partners to ensure the full and effective \r\nimplementation of the Declaration on the Conduct of \r\nParties in the South China Sea and to work for the early \r\nconclusion of a code of conduct.\r\nAt the international level, Viet Nam is prepared \r\nto further its active contributions to world peace and \r\nsecurity and the well-being of all. That is why we \r\nare stepping up our participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations and have put forward our \r\ncandidatures for the Economic and Social Council for \r\n2016-2018, the UNESCO Executive Board for 2015-\r\n2019 and the Security Council for 2020-2021. We look \r\nforward to receiving Members’ continued support.\r\nTo free our people from fear and want and to \r\nleave no one behind, let us all join our actions on this \r\npath towards a better and more sustainable future. \r\nLet the Charter of the United Nations be our source \r\nof inspiration and the 2030 Agenda be our guide in \r\nbuilding a world of peace, security and prosperity for \r\nour people and succeeding generations.\r\n15-29940 7/18\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Turkmenistan.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nIt gives me great pleasure to join previous speakers in \r\nwarmly congratulating Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventieth session and to wish him success. Allow \r\nme also to express my appreciation to Mr. Sam Kutesa \r\nfor the tremendous work that he carried out as President \r\nof the Assembly at its sixty-ninth session. I also \r\ncongratulate the United Nations and all delegations on \r\nthe seventieth anniversary and wish our Organization \r\ncontinued success, universal recognition and respect.\r\nIn its approach to the major themes of the current \r\nsession, Turkmenistan believes there is a need to take \r\nconcrete and targeted measures aimed at supporting \r\nStates and regions where, for various reasons, the issues \r\nof sustainable development are particularly acute. \r\nWith regard to Central Asia, there is currently \r\ndiscussion about the creation of the conditions enabling \r\nits successful integration into modern global processes \r\nand its rebirth as a region that provides a stable and \r\nstrong link in intercontinental partnerships. I am \r\nconvinced that that is an achievable goal, if we can \r\nensure peace, tranquillity and security, which are key \r\nfactors for the development, progress and prosperity \r\nof the Central Asian States. That has been the focus \r\nof Turkmenistan’s major efforts and the projects and \r\ninitiatives that it is carrying out, which it invites the \r\ninternational community, represented by the United \r\nNations, to join.\r\nOne of the projects is the idea of  establishing a \r\nUnited Nations regional centre in Central Asia for \r\ntechnology related to climate change. The large-scale \r\nenvironmental problems that exist in that region are, I \r\nthink, well known. They directly or indirectly affect the \r\noverall atmosphere in the region, as well as the standard \r\nof living and the quality of life of the inhabitants, and \r\nsometimes have a negative impact on relations between \r\nStates. Under those conditions, it is becoming clear \r\nthat there is a need for a specialized international body \r\nthat would be able, with a United Nations mandate, to \r\ncarry out monitoring and an objective analysis of the \r\nenvironmental processes and trends occurring there and, \r\non that basis, be able to issue relevant recommendations \r\nto the Governments of the Central Asian States. The \r\nvision for the functions and directions of the activities \r\nof such a centre already exist. Turkmenistan is ready to \r\nprovide all the necessary infrastructure for the centre \r\nin Turkmenistan and to ensure the most favourable \r\nconditions for its staff. I therefore call for an in-depth \r\nconsideration of our proposal on the creation of a \r\nUnited Nations regional centre for technology related \r\nto climate change in Central Asia.\r\nThe achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals in the region will not be possible without the \r\nparticipation of our closest neighbour, Afghanistan. \r\nThe brotherly Afghan people and Government are \r\ntoday particularly in need of the political and moral \r\nsupport of the international community. They also need \r\nreal, tangible economic assistance. Time has shown \r\nthat the resolution of the situation in Afghanistan is \r\npossible only through peaceful, political means on the \r\nbasis of a broad national dialogue with the participation \r\nof all responsible and constructive forces representing \r\nthe Afghan people. Moreover, we are convinced that \r\nthe process of reconciliation must be accompanied by \r\neffective international economic assistance, targeted \r\nmeasures aimed at creating social infrastructure and \r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nWe believe that the most important factor in the \r\nstability, progress and prosperity of Afghanistan is the \r\nintegration of the country into regional and international \r\nenergy and transportation projects. Projects such as \r\nthe Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India Pipeline \r\nand the railway from Turkmenistan to Afghanistan are \r\ndesigned to ensure economic growth and the creation \r\nof new jobs in Afghanistan and favourable conditions \r\nfor foreign investment. Not least important, their \r\nimplementation will have a significant stabilizing effect \r\non the political climate in Afghanistan itself, as well as \r\non the surrounding area. It will also restore the Afghan \r\npeople’s confidence in their own strength and capacity \r\nto build a modern, stable and dynamic State, one that \r\nis an equal and like-minded partner with neighbouring \r\ncountries and the entire international community. As an \r\ninitiator and participant in those international projects, \r\nTurkmenistan will continue to provide assistance to \r\nAfghanistan at the bilateral level for the construction \r\nof economic and social facilities, as well as to supply \r\nenergy at a discounted rate and to provide training for \r\nAfghan professionals in our educational institutions.\r\nIn the context of Afghanistan’s restoration, the \r\nsupport provided to both developing and the least \r\ndeveloped countries, on which the effectiveness \r\nof today’s entire system of international relations \r\ndepends, is of over-arching importance. Therefore, \r\n8/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\nfor Turkmenistan, the main goal and essence of post-\r\n2015 sustainable development should be to overcome \r\nthe serious — and I would even say borderline \r\ndangerous — imbalance between States, regions and \r\nentire continents, in terms of industry, the economy, \r\ntechnology and the environment, as well as with respect \r\nto people’s quality of life and in the areas of health care, \r\neducation and in the standards and structures of food \r\nsystems. It is obvious that humanitarian assistance \r\nalone, as well as supplies of medicine and provisions, \r\nalong with one-time financial infusions by the United \r\nNations and individual States, while extremely \r\nimportant, will not solve the problem.\r\nToday, there is a need for a long-term, in-depth and \r\nwell thought-out strategy for support for developing \r\nand the least developed countries that includes a \r\nwide range of political, legal, economic, social \r\nand investment measures. An action-oriented and \r\ncoordinating role should be played here by the United \r\nNations, in particular its Economic and Social Council \r\nand the United Nations Development Programme, as \r\nwell as other specialized agencies. A more important \r\nfactor for such support is, in our view, the participation \r\nof such countries in international economic projects, \r\nin particular in the area of the transport of energy to \r\nglobal markets, as well as the creation of transport \r\ncorridors between regions and across continents.\r\nTurkmen initiatives for the development of such \r\nsectors of the global economy have received unanimous \r\napproval from the General Assembly through the \r\nadoption of relevant resolutions. We expect meaningful \r\nfollow-up through their implementation. I would also \r\nlike to emphasize the readiness of our country to both \r\ncontinue and strengthen cooperation with the World \r\nHealth Organization, the United Nations World Food \r\nProgramme, the United Nations Population Fund and \r\nother entities.\r\nThe current session should provide us with clear \r\nguidelines for the future. It is natural and appropriate \r\nthat it is the United Nations, the international entity \r\nwith a universal mandate, that will act as the leader in \r\npromoting and achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. The tremendous potential of the United Nations, \r\nwhich has been acquired over seven decades of unique \r\nexperience of dealing with the challenges and threats \r\nand providing solutions for many global problems, \r\nproves that only together, by joining forces, will it be \r\npossible for us to achieve the goals we have set, no \r\nmatter how difficult they may be.\r\nTurkmenistan believes that today, within these \r\nwalls, significant momentum will be given to our \r\nforward movement and to the new, more humane and \r\nmore just world order. Together with the family of \r\nnations we are prepared to participate in that work.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the respresentative of Peru.\r\nMr. Meza Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): It is \r\nan honour for me to address the General Assembly and \r\nto convey my congratulations to President Lykketoft on \r\nhis election. Peru is ready to contribute to the success \r\nof his mandate.\r\nSeventy years ago, we established the United \r\nNations Organization so as to maintain international \r\npeace and security, promote and protect human \r\nrights and cooperate at the international level for \r\nthe development of our peoples. We now renew our \r\ncommitment to its purposes and principles and affirm \r\nthe need to continue working to ensure that its vision \r\nbecomes a tangible reality for all and that we leave \r\nfuture generations a sustainable planet.\r\nMy country is particularly proud to have been \r\na founding member of the Organization and to have \r\nsteadfastly been committed to its Charter and to \r\nmultilateralism. We would like now to recall three \r\nillustrious Peruvians who held three high-ranking \r\nposts: Ambassador Javier Pérez de Cuéllar, who was \r\nSecretary-General; the former President of Peru, José \r\nLuis Bustamante y Rivero, who was President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice; and Mr. Víctor Andrés \r\nBelaúnde, who was President of the General Assembly.\r\nThere is no doubt that the United Nations system \r\nhas contributed, and continues to contribute, a great \r\ndeal to the progress of humankind. We must realize that, \r\nfor over 70 years, we have not seen another major war \r\nsuch as the ones that beset the world in the first half of \r\nthe twentieth century, nor has there been an economic \r\ncrisis of the magnitude of the Great Depression. \r\nHowever, there is no doubt that the achievements of the \r\nUnited Nations have not reached everyone equally. The \r\nworld compels us to rethink what kind of Organization \r\nit is that we need and to redouble our efforts to ensure \r\nthat peace and security, human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment are truly universal. \r\nPeru attaches the greatest importance to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). \r\nWe have agreed to transform the world in a single \r\n15-29940 9/18\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27\r\ngeneration in a process throughout which our people \r\nhave been heard and our cultural diversity has been \r\nacknowledged as a catalyst for development. For \r\nthe first time in history, humankind has a universal \r\ninstrument through which we have committed \r\nourselves to eradicating poverty in all its forms and \r\ndimensions and to achieving sustainable development \r\nover the next 15 years without leaving anyone behind. \r\nIn fact, we have decided to strengthen and renew the \r\nglobal partnership for sustainable development. In \r\nline with Peru’s priorities for social inclusion, we are \r\nhappy to see that the 2030 Agenda reflects that same \r\ntransformational character throughout.. We must be \r\ninclusive in order to grow, and we must give priority \r\nto the economic and social groups that have been left \r\nbehind and those that are most vulnerable, which, more \r\noften than not, include indigenous peoples, the elderly, \r\npersons with disabilities and migrants.\r\nIn order to implement the new Agenda it is essential \r\nto allocate sufficient resources. We need to increase the \r\nbudgets for programmes that involve social inclusion, \r\nespecially in the fields of health and education, giving \r\npriority to the care of our children, gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment of women. Peru considers it vital to \r\nadopt at the twenty-first meeting of the Conference of \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Conference \r\non Climate Change, to be held in Paris in December, a \r\nuniversally binding, ambitious and balanced agreement \r\nto address climate change. As the current Acting \r\nPresident of that Conference, Peru is sparing no effort \r\nto reach that goal, in accordance with the Lima Call \r\nfor Climate Action. Climate change and environmental \r\nchallenges are endless. The experts say that we will be \r\nfacing a particularly serious situation with regard to \r\nEl Niño over the next few years. We must invest more \r\nin disaster prevention and risk reduction as part of \r\nour development plans. Peru, a country of stupendous \r\nbiodiversity, would also like to call attention to the great \r\npotential of biodiversity for development. In that regard, \r\nwe are particularly concerned about the preservation \r\nand sustainable use of land and sea ecosystems. \r\nAs is the case with sustainable development, \r\nthe United Nations must make strides in the area of \r\ninternational peace and security in order to ensure \r\nrespect for and promotion of human rights. Peru \r\ncommends the important progress that has been made \r\ntowards achieving peace in the sister Republic of \r\nColombia. We also welcome the restoration of relations \r\nbetween the Republic of Cuba and the United States, \r\nand we again appeal for an end to the economic and \r\nfinancial blockade.\r\nConcerning the question of Palestine, the Security \r\nCouncil must be proactive in promoting a dialogue that \r\nleads to direct negotiations. Palestinians and Israelis \r\nshould live together in peace and should prosper in two \r\nStates within secure and internationally recognized \r\nborders. The status quo is unsustainable. Peru \r\nreaffirms its commitment to defending and promoting \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law, the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes and conflict prevention.\r\nWe believe that the jurisdiction of the International \r\nCourt of Justice and the International Criminal Court \r\nshould be universally recognized. We therefore \r\nencourage States that have not yet done so to fully \r\naccede to their respective statutes. We must strengthen \r\nour ability to react to humanitarian crises and prevent \r\nimpunity for atrocities. No State can ignore the \r\nresponsibility to protect human beings. Peru deplores \r\nthe situation that has developed in Syria and the evil \r\ncrimes of the so-called Islamic State.\r\nWe must ensure the continued legitimacy of the \r\nSecurity Council. It is vital that we work to achieve \r\nits comprehensive reform, both in its composition \r\nand working methods and by restricting the use of \r\nthe veto, if we are to ensure its representativeness \r\nand effectiveness. In that regard, Peru has been \r\nworking within the Accountability, Consistency and \r\nTransparency group on the adoption of a code of \r\nconduct that can guide the Security Council’s action \r\nwhere heinous crimes are concerned.\r\nAware of the new tasks included in the mandates \r\nof peacekeeping operations, Peru will be sending \r\nan engineering company to the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission \r\nin the Central African Republic, the first time that a \r\nPeruvian company has deployed outside our region.\r\nPeru has been working to deal decisively and \r\neffectively with the global drug problem. In that regard, \r\nwe have been implementing a successful strategy with \r\na comprehensive approach that includes actions aimed \r\nat prevention, control and interdiction, as well as \r\nsustainable alternative development programmes for \r\nfarmers. In the past year, as a result of that strategy, we \r\nrecorded a net reduction in illicit crops that was almost \r\n14 per cent greater and cocaine seizures that were \r\n40 per cent higher than the fugures for 2013. In the past \r\nyear alone, we expanded our alternative development \r\n10/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\nprogrammes to cover more than 50,000 hectares, and \r\nwe have reforested about 15,000 hectares that had been \r\naffected by illicit crops. The special session in 2016 that \r\nthe General Assembly will devote to the scourge of drugs \r\nshould reaffirm full enforcement of the international \r\nconventions relating to drugs and the commitment to \r\naddressing the problem through national strategies.\r\nWe also consider it very important to continue \r\npromoting an environment conducive, at every level, to \r\neffective arms control, including limiting conventional \r\nweapons and enforcing the non-proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction. We reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nArms Trade Treaty and the principles of disarmament \r\nand nuclear non-proliferation, without prejudice to the \r\ninalienable right of all States to research and produce \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\r\nAs I noted at the beginning of my statement, the \r\ninternational community is taking on the ambitious \r\ntask of transforming the world by eradicating poverty \r\nand achieving sustainable development through its \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda. In order to \r\nachieve the new Agenda’s Goals, States will have to \r\nsignificantly increase the resources that they dedicate \r\nto the implementation of the Goals and strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation in every way. A renewed \r\nglobal partnership should also strengthen cooperation \r\nin the field of disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nand promote confidence-building measures aimed \r\nat preventing conflicts, arms races and humanitarian \r\ncrises, because without peace there can be no \r\ndevelopment. Seventy years after its creation, this \r\nOrganization can and should contribute to making a \r\nreality of the future we all want.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the representative of Honduras.\r\nMs. Flores (Honduras) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nare speaking in the Assembly today, as His Holiness \r\nPope Francis said, as an afterthought. The President \r\nof Honduras, Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, \r\nappeared a few days ago in this Hall, addressing the \r\nSustainable Development Summit (see A/70/PV.5). \r\nAt this final stage of the debate we are not going to \r\noverwhelm the Assembly with long speeches, when so \r\nmany renowned leaders, speaking on behalf of their \r\nStates, have already delivered more informed views on \r\nthe contentious issues that concern us.\r\nAll of us who have the singular privilege of using \r\nthis unique platform in this unique forum, where we \r\ndiscuss feelings, opinions, criticisms and reflections \r\non the world’s most important issues, are influenced \r\nby the places that we come from and our particular \r\nperspectives on the world. It could not be otherwise, for \r\nwe are the products of our origins and environment. It \r\nis natural that those of us who come from places of dire \r\ndeprivation, pressing needs and miserable exclusion, \r\nsee things differently from those from areas of wealth, \r\nabundance, power and superiority. We even differ in \r\nhow we understand the universal terms of law, justice \r\nand equity. It is even true that we can question what \r\nis the truth itself, if we are not familiar with another’s \r\nperception of the truth.\r\nWe all react according to our own reality. How \r\ncan victims who have to leave their homes and embark \r\non terrible migrations for reasons of extreme poverty \r\nor situations of overwhelming violence, in search of \r\na better life and an unclouded future for their loved \r\nones, understand the concept of law and justice in the \r\nsame way as those who enjoy all possible assurances \r\nand opportunities and who do not want their comfort \r\ndisrupted by inconvenient strangers? Perhaps what we \r\ndo not see in this dichotomy in the interpretation of \r\nessential human values is that there can be no peace \r\nor security for anyone unless there is peace and well-\r\nbeing for all. There is no stone wall, no human law, \r\nno physical obstacle that can contain the movement of \r\nhuman beings being compelled by the right to life.\r\nOf course, it is our homelands that we belong to and \r\nthat our hearts return to, our inalienable lands with their \r\ntears and smiles, setbacks and celebrations, hardships \r\nand riches, boundaries and expanses, reservations and \r\ndreams, gaps and opportunities. We all want to be born \r\nand die in our homelands. But for many, the cradle can \r\nsometimes also be the fence that limits us and constrains \r\nour yearning for the possible. The shadows of fear created \r\nby insecurity and the struggle for survival provoked \r\nby scarcity are powerful forces that can drive anyone \r\nto leave their homes and undertake a terrible journey \r\nto the unknown. Serious and desperate circumstances \r\ncompel people to leave what they cherish the most. The \r\nurge to survive and the attachment to freedom know \r\nno borders. Mass migrations are only a symptom of \r\nother acute problems that must be addressed. And we \r\nall have a responsibility to address those problems, but, \r\nfirst and foremost, we need to produce results rather \r\nthan just promises, because despair saps even the most \r\nlong-suffering patience.\r\n15-29940 11/18\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27\r\nThe answer to that serious dilemma is not something \r\nthat we have to invent. It lies at the foundation of the \r\nnatural values of civilization, in the divine principles of \r\nspirituality where all religions converge, in the doctrines \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations that inspired the \r\nvery existence of the United Nations — harmonious \r\nand respectful coexistence among brothers and sisters \r\nof the same world family, where all of us are citizens \r\nof a common home, regardless of race, gender, creed \r\nor origin; and where there is, of course, universal \r\nsolidarity, so that no one abuses resources that others \r\nlack, and the offer of a fraternal hand where it is needed.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on the representative of the Republic of Kiribati.\r\nMr. Baaro (Kiribati): It is an honour and a \r\nprivilege to address this historic seventieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of the President, the \r\nGovernment and the people of Kiribati. In Kiribati \r\nwe begin all formal events such as this by conferring \r\nblessings on all. I therefore wish to begin by sharing \r\nwith the Assembly all our traditional Kiribati blessing \r\nof peace and good health, “Kam na bane ni Mauri”.\r\nI echo the sentiments conveyed by previous \r\nspeakers in congratulating the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventieth session on his \r\nelection and for presiding over the recently concluded \r\nhistoric Summit for the adoption of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, held from 25 to 27 September. On \r\nhis assumption of the presidency for the first year of \r\nthe implementation the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), I wish to assure him of \r\nthe full support and cooperation of Kiribati. Let me also \r\ntake this opportunity to acknowledge with appreciation \r\nthe commendable leadership of his predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his stewardship over \r\nthe past year as the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session and for guiding the massive \r\ntask of shaping the recently adopted Agenda.\r\nI also wish to commend the unwavering commitment \r\nand hard work of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho has served as an able navigator of our family ship, \r\nsteering the United Nations through the diverse and \r\ncomplex realities and the myriad challenges facing our \r\npeoples and nations around the world. In particular, I \r\nwish to commend his sterling leadership in guiding the \r\ndevelopment of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, recently adopted by the membership, \r\nand his personal unwavering commitment to focusing \r\nglobal attention on those who are most vulnerable and \r\nwho are directly targeted by the many major challenges \r\nfacing us today as a global community.\r\nWe meet at a critical time in the history of \r\nmultilateralism. The global community very recently \r\nendorsed a new post-2015 development agenda \r\n“Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development”. We are also celebrating the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the founding of the United \r\nNations. In two months, leaders from around the \r\nworld will meet in Paris for the twenty-first session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) \r\nto finalize an agreement on climate change. As we \r\ncelebrate, we should also reflect on the needs of the \r\nmost fragile and vulnerable peoples and ensure that \r\nthe premier global Organization remains responsive to \r\nthem. That will be the real litmus test for its relevance.\r\nIf we as a family of nations do not act, if we fail \r\nto focus on the challenges faced by those in the front \r\nline, whatever those challenges may be, then we would \r\nhave failed the millions who are looking to the United \r\nNations to assume leadership. I would like to reiterate \r\nour deepest appreciation to the Secretary-General for his \r\ndemonstrated commitment and leadership in focusing \r\nthe attention of the United Nations and the world on \r\nsuch issues as mitigating the plight of the most needy \r\nand alleviating poverty, addressing the Ebola pandemic, \r\nhearing the views of young people and women and \r\nenabling their participation in development, ending \r\ngender-based violence, achieving peace and security, \r\nand dealing with the question of climate change.\r\nThe challenges facing us as we gather again in \r\nNew York for this historic session are perhaps greater \r\nthan they were a year ago. Security challenges posed \r\nby climate change, conflicts, terrorism, cybercrime, \r\ntransnational organized crime and the mass movement \r\nof refugees now seen in Europe are among the looming \r\nchallenges that continue to undermine our efforts as \r\na global family to achieve sustainable development, \r\npeace and security for our communities.\r\nIf we were to ask what the root causes of those \r\nmajor challenges were, we would be able to find many \r\nof the answers in the fact that too little attention has \r\nbeen paid to the problems addressed in the Goals \r\nrecently endorsed in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. The Goals are not new. Most, if not all, \r\nare in our national development plans and strategies. \r\n12/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\nWhat is new is the global call for the international \r\ncommunity to act together to do things differently in \r\norder to effect the transformational changes necessary \r\nto achieve the prosperous, peaceful, just and equitable \r\nsocieties that will benefit all. That is crucial in an \r\nincreasingly interdependent world in which decisions \r\nmade and actions taken in one country will have ripple \r\neffects elsewhere in the globe.\r\nBut in adopting the new Agenda, we must not leave \r\nundone the unfinished business of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs). Many countries, Kiribati \r\nincluded, do not have a strong scorecard with respect \r\nto the implementation of the MDGs, for a compelling \r\nreason. We, like all small island developing States, face \r\nmajor challenges in our development efforts, challenges \r\nwhich are well documented and which I will not repeat \r\nhere. Those challenges are further compounded by \r\nclimate change.\r\nMy people live on low-lying atoll islands that are no \r\nhigher than 3 metres above sea level. With the changes \r\nin our climate system and with sea-level rise, our \r\nislands are now facing major challenges never before \r\nfaced in our history. We have experienced climate \r\nextremes, not only from sea-level rise but also from \r\ndisastrous natural events, such as cyclone Pam which \r\nhit Vanuatu and other low-lying Pacific islands, mine \r\nincluded, earlier this year, soon followed by typhoons \r\nMaysak and Dolphin.\r\nHigh tides combined with strong winds wreaked \r\nhavoc on our islands, our homes, our villages and our \r\npeople. What is particularly alarming is the increasing \r\nfrequency and severity of such events. In some parts \r\nof the country, whole villages have had to relocate \r\nbecause of severe coastal erosion and f looding. Food \r\ncrops have been destroyed and the freshwater lakes, our \r\nmajor source of drinking water, are increasingly being \r\ncontaminated by the intruding seawater. Our people are \r\nworried as they watch those events grow in intensity. The \r\nmost vulnerable are the already vulnerable — women, \r\nchildren, the disabled, the sick and the aged.\r\nAll those events have put pressure on our already \r\nstressed national systems and limited national resources \r\nand will continue to do so. Kiribati and other low-lying \r\natoll countries such as Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, \r\nMaldives and Tokelau, as well as the millions of people \r\nliving in coastal areas in the Pacific and around the \r\nglobe, have first to address the critical and pressing \r\nhere-and-now challenges from climate change, before \r\nwe can even begin to talk of sustainable development \r\nor a new development agenda.\r\nThe first real test of our commitment to the new \r\ndevelopment agenda adopted by the international \r\ncommunity will be the Paris climate summit. The \r\nSustainable Development Agenda will mean nothing if \r\nthe Paris climate summit in December fails to come up \r\nwith an ambitious and legally binding agreement that \r\naddresses the predicament of those on the front line of \r\nclimate change and saves humankind by halting global \r\nwarming. For us on the front line of climate change, \r\nthe Paris outcome document must include a long-term \r\ntemperature goal to limit global average temperature \r\nincrease to below 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels. It \r\nmust also include provisions on loss and damage as a \r\nstand-alone element that is separate and distinct from \r\nadaptation.\r\nWe must all step up our national and collective \r\nefforts to mitigate global greenhouse-gas emissions. \r\nWe must urge major greenhouse-gas emitters to do their \r\npart. Last week, my country, one of the countries with \r\nthe lowest level of emissions, submitted an ambitious \r\nintended nationally determined contribution to the \r\nUNFCCC secretariat. We must call with urgency on our \r\ndevelopment partners, on philanthropic partners and on \r\nprivate businesses to assist us on the front line of the \r\nclimate calamity to deal with the impacts of climate \r\nchange and sea-level rise now being experienced in \r\nour countries and to support our efforts to build the \r\nresilience and preparedness of our people as they face \r\nan uncertain future. It is high time we recognize that the \r\nnew challenges require us to draw on all the resources \r\navailable to the global community and to accept that \r\nsustainable development and global challenges such as \r\nclimate change should not be confined to the sphere of \r\nGovernments alone.\r\nLet us call on all those with the ability to assist \r\nand with a contribution to make to join in the global \r\ndialogue and, more important, to take part in urgent \r\naction to address this major challenge. Let us bring in \r\nour young people, our women, civil society, the private \r\nsector, churches, universities, traditional institutions \r\nand indigenous populations. Let us bring everyone \r\non board. Let us be inclusive. Let all who have a \r\ncontribution to make make it. \r\nWe welcome the inclusive approach taken in \r\ndeveloping the post-2015 development agenda. We \r\nalso welcome the participation of Taiwan in the World \r\n15-29940 13/18\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27\r\nHealth Assembly — for example, its inclusion in the \r\nfight against Ebola — and we would like to see a \r\nsimilar inclusive approach prevail in respect of other \r\ninternational institutions and United Nations processes \r\nin implementing the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand in the call for urgent climate action, where Taiwan \r\nand all who can participate and contribute meaningfully \r\nfor the good of humankind must be brought in to do so. \r\nEveryone needs to be brought in.\r\n“Business as usual” can no longer be our approach. \r\nLet us not confine ourselves to our comfort zones and \r\nour usual economic arguments; let us stop avoiding \r\nour political taboos. The challenge of climate change \r\nmakes a larger demand on us. It requires that we \r\nrise above national priorities and think with a global \r\nconsciousness. We must go outside the bounds of \r\nconventional thinking — outside the norm — because \r\nthe challenge before us is extraordinarily serious and \r\ntherefore calls for extraordinary and unconventional \r\nsolutions.\r\nIt is most gratifying to note that there is an emerging \r\nglimmer of hope, that there is a shift in the wind in the \r\ndialogue on climate change. We welcome the opinion of \r\nHis Holiness Pope Francis on climate change, together \r\nwith the messages and expressions of commitment from \r\na growing number of quarters, including capitals around \r\nthe globe and civil society, in which climate change is \r\nrecognized as posing a major challenge and requiring \r\nurgent action. We welcome this most gratifying shift \r\nas a very positive development in the right direction, \r\nimplying that the international community has at last \r\nheard our messages and the stories we have shared \r\nabout the plight of our people.\r\nBut hearing our story and recognizing that climate \r\nchange is a major challenge is not enough; we need to \r\nact on it with urgency. We islands may be on the front \r\nline, but so are the millions of people around the world \r\nliving in low-lying areas. They are just as vulnerable. \r\nSo are the millions of others facing prolonged droughts, \r\nhigher temperatures and melting glaciers. For them, like \r\nus, sustainable development and the recently adopted \r\nnew Agenda will not mean anything, unless the global \r\ncommunity steps up, and steps up substantially, its \r\nefforts to combat climate change.\r\nWe take full responsibility for the future of our \r\npeople and we will do our part. In Kiribati, we have \r\nadopted a multi-pronged strategy to ensure the survival \r\nof our people. We have bought land offshore. We have \r\nlooked at f loating and artificial islands and options for \r\nraising our islands from their current heights to heights \r\nabove the predicted sea-level rises. We have embarked \r\non a major education reform programme designed \r\nto upgrade the skills of our people in line with our \r\nprogramme on migration with dignity.\r\nBut we cannot do it alone. There needs to be a \r\ncollective global effort. We call for new and accessible \r\nfinancial resources to assist the most vulnerable to adapt \r\nand build resilience to climate change. We welcome the \r\ncontinued assistance of our partners, including Taiwan, \r\nbut much, much more needs to be done. While it is \r\ncommendable that there have been significant pledges \r\nfor the Green Climate Fund, there remain the challenge \r\nof accessibility and the translation of these pledges into \r\ncontributions where they matter the most. We welcome \r\nthe assistance provided by various agencies with the \r\ncapacity to provide the needed conduit, but it is equally \r\nimportant that such assistance not get eroded in the \r\nprocess.\r\nIn celebrating the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nunited family of nations, we must have confidence that, \r\nas we pledge in the preamble to the 2030 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Agenda, no member nation will be left \r\nbehind. It is simply not sufficient to acknowledge that \r\nclimate change is an existential challenge. It is about \r\nour response as the global community and what actions \r\nwe take as a community of moral human beings.\r\nI reiterate that the real test of the effectiveness and \r\nrelevance of the new Sustainable Development Agenda, \r\nand indeed the relevance of the united family of nations \r\nas it celebrates its seventieth anniversary, is in ensuring \r\nthat no one is left behind. Yet my people and those on \r\nthe front line of climate change face the real possibility \r\nof being left behind. I therefore call on the General \r\nAssembly to lend its support to the voice of the most \r\nvulnerable and call on the international community to \r\ncraft an ambitious legally binding agreement that can \r\nbegin to heal our one shared home and planet. I further \r\ncall on the General Assembly to join those on the front \r\nline of climate change in requesting the Conference of \r\nthe Parties in Paris to agree that the increase in global \r\naverage temperature should be held below 2°C or 1.5°C \r\nabove pre-industrial levels. The climate agreement must \r\nalso include provisions on loss and damage and, most \r\nimportant, a special mechanism to fast-track urgent \r\nassistance to the millions of people who are at the front \r\nline of climate change and who need that assistance \r\nimmediately. \r\n14/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Guinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. Da Gama (Guinea-Bissau) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Mario Vaz, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, has honoured me with the \r\ntask of conveying his congratulations to Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its historic seventieth session and wishes \r\nhim great success. We would also like to commend his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa of Uganda, for the wise \r\nand dignified manner in which he conducted the work \r\nat the sixty-ninth session. The President’s election to \r\nthe General Assembly at the seventieth session takes \r\nplace at a time when the nations of the world decided \r\nto adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), thereby leading humankind in a new \r\ndirection and promoting a more just world for all. We \r\nbelieve that with his extensive experience and under his \r\nleadership, we can begin effectively implementing the \r\nAgenda.\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations, which coincides with the forty-second \r\nanniversary of our country’s own independence, \r\nGuinea-Bissau continues to experience instability. That \r\nis reflected in its vulnerabilities and its difficulties in \r\nestablishing the foundations necessary for the creation \r\nof a stable State. Those foundations are primarily geared \r\nto development, in fulfilment of the dream of Amílcar \r\nCabral, the father of the nation. While other nations in \r\nthe world are able to seize this moment to strengthen \r\ntheir statehood and consolidate their institutions, \r\nGuinea-Bissau continues to look for solutions to our \r\nvarious domestic problems. The current political \r\nsituation in Guinea-Bissau shows that our country is \r\nstill striving to move from fragility to stability.\r\nDespite the recurrent instability, the people of \r\nGuinea-Bissau have never doubted the viability of our \r\ncountry, as we believe in our ability to overcome that \r\nchallenge once again. Our determination to build the \r\nviable State we dream of is and will always remain \r\nintact. Our ability to overcome difficulties and perform \r\ngreat feats was gloriously demonstrated by our fighters \r\nfor the freedom of the homeland, who brought about our \r\nindependence 42 years ago in an exemplary manner, \r\nunder the wise leadership of our much missed Amílcar \r\nCabral and in the context of his minimum programme.\r\nToday, more than ever, we are determined to achieve \r\nthe maximum programme in that glorious struggle \r\nand to promote social and economic development \r\nand environmental conservation. Since our return \r\nto constitutional normality with the installation of \r\nthe Government that emerged from the April 2014 \r\nlegislative elections, together with the establishment \r\nof other institutions of sovereignty, we have striven to \r\nprovide the basic conditions required to relaunch our \r\ncountry’s economy and to address the new challenges \r\nfor peacebuilding and security.\r\nTo that end, the 2015-2025 Terra Ranka development \r\nstrategy, presented in March 2015 in Brussels, \r\nwas fully discussed and approved at the national \r\nlevel and strongly supported by the international \r\ncommunity. It will provide continuity for the actions \r\nof the Government, which is currently led by Carlos \r\nCorreia. That development strategy is also consistent \r\nwith the Goals established in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, adopted one week ago by \r\nthe General Assembly. We are convinced that the full \r\nimplementation of the Agenda will greatly contribute, \r\nnot only to our country’s sustainable development, but \r\nalso to establishing, once and for all, the necessary \r\nconditions for peace and stability in our country. In \r\nthat regard, once again, from this rostrum, I appeal to \r\nthe partners and friends of Guinea-Bissau to honour \r\nthe commitments undertaken in Brussels and not to \r\nfrustrate the enormous expectations of the people \r\nof Guinea-Bissau, who have mobilized around that \r\nstrategy.\r\nConflict resolution was one of the primary goals \r\nthat led to the establishment of our Organization in 1945. \r\nAnd today, that same goal continues to be a priority and \r\none of our greatest challenges. Current conflicts have \r\nemerged for a variety of reasons and taken on ever more \r\ncomplex forms, making them even more difficult to \r\nresolve. There is no political or geopolitical justification \r\nfor the United Nations to find itself in an impasse when \r\naddressing the tragedies caused by the conflicts in the \r\nMiddle East and other regions of the world, which have \r\ncreated one of the greatest refugee crises ever recorded. \r\nWe have the moral responsibility to find a solution. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to commend the European \r\nUnion and other countries for the solidarity that they \r\nhave shown in providing the required humanitarian \r\nassistance and welcoming those refugees.\r\nIssues related to the African continent continue to \r\npredominate on the agenda of the Security Council, and \r\n15-29940 15/18\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27\r\nnine of the 16 United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nare in African countries. Therefore, the views of \r\nthat continent and its 54 countries must be heard \r\nand considered when decisions on the management \r\nof conflicts are taken. Our legitimate claim for \r\ntwo permanent seats and broader representation as \r\nnon-permanent members on the Security Council must \r\nbe heeded. We call again for a reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, based on our belief that the historical reasons \r\nfor the establishment of the Organization are no longer \r\nvalid as they do not reflect the current political reality \r\nin the world. We also express our support for permanent \r\nseats for Brazil, India, Japan and Germany.\r\nWe continue to believe that preventive diplomacy \r\ncan be more efficient in preventing and resolving \r\nconflicts. We believe that the best way to prevent \r\nconflicts would be to invest more in combating poverty, \r\npromoting gender equality, education and the struggle \r\nagainst social discrimination, and preserving the \r\nenvironment.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is without a doubt a step in the right \r\ndirection, and Guinea-Bissau reiterates its commitment \r\nto achieving the Agenda in accordance with its \r\nprecise terms. To this end, the fulfilment of the \r\ncommitments undertaken by our partners with respect \r\nto official development assistance and other funds for \r\ndevelopment becomes critical for the most vulnerable \r\ncountries, including the least developed countries and \r\nsmall island developing States, such as Guinea-Bissau.\r\nFor many years, it has been a tradition for our \r\ncountry to appeal from this rostrum for the lifting of the \r\neconomic and financial embargo imposed by the United \r\nStates of America against Cuba. Today, we would like \r\nto welcome the restoration of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween the two countries, which had been broken off \r\nsince 1961. Since the Cuban people should be able to \r\ntake full advantage of their potential and freely pursue \r\neconomic and financial relations with other States and \r\npeoples of the world, we encourage the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba to proceed with negotiations towards \r\nthe normalization of their relations and the total lifting \r\nof the embargo.\r\nWe hope and wish that the main actors in the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian peace process can draw inspiration from \r\nthat example and engage in diplomatic negotiations \r\nwith a view to the peaceful coexistence of two States.\r\nWe welcome the nuclear agreement between the \r\ninternational community and Iran and hope that it will \r\nresult in the normalization of relations with the rest \r\nof world and the international community. We firmly \r\nbelieve that the world will be totally secure only if there \r\nis general and complete nuclear disarmament.\r\nClimate change is an undeniable reality and is a \r\ndangerous threat to the existence of humankind. In that \r\nregard, it is important that we all pledge to fulfil our \r\nresponsibilities with respect to the environment and that \r\nwe all commit to protecting the planet in accordance \r\nwith the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibilities. The session of the Conference of the \r\nParties that will take place in Paris in December will \r\nundoubtedly offer a new opportunity for the world to \r\nrectify its behaviour with respect to nature. We are \r\nlooking for robust commitments on the part of Member \r\nStates to reducing greenhouse gas emissions and \r\nproviding the necessary funds for developing countries \r\nto address environmental challenges.\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without expressing \r\nour gratitude to all our development partners, the United \r\nNations in particular, for their continued follow-up on \r\nthe situation in our country, and for the commitments \r\nthey made at the Brussels round table last March on \r\nfinancing our strategic operational programme of \r\ndevelopment. Guinea-Bissau and its people are counting \r\non all of you.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this \r\nmeeting. \r\nI now call on those representatives who have asked \r\nto speak in exercise of the the right to reply. I remind \r\nmembers that statements in exercise of the right of reply \r\nmust be limited to 10 minutes for the first statement and \r\n5 minutes for the second, should there be one, and that \r\ndelegations should speak from their seats.\r\nMr. Milanović (Serbia): My delegation would like \r\nto exercise its right of reply in response to the statement \r\nthat was made today by the Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Albania, Mr. Edi Rama,\r\nAt this historic seventieth session of the General \r\nAssembly, as the States Members of the United Nations \r\ninvest maximum efforts in solving the problems and \r\nchallenges that face the international community, \r\nI would like to underline that the consolidation of \r\ninternational peace, security and stability continue to \r\n16/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\nbe a priority issue for the Republic of Serbia as well. \r\nIn order to achieve those goals, my country invests \r\nmaximum efforts in strengthening regional cooperation, \r\nstabilization and reconciliation, efforts for which it has \r\nbeen widely recognized and acclaimed.\r\nUnfortunately, the Prime Minister of Albania \r\nagain misled the Assembly in his statement today by \r\ncontending that dialogue is being conducted between \r\ntwo States — namely, Serbia and Kosovo — and not \r\nbetween Belgrade and Pristina, as is really the case. \r\nKosovo is not an independent State and is not a Member \r\nof the United Nations. Mr. Rama also called on the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to recognize \r\nthe so-called independent State of Kosovo, contrary \r\nto international law and the principles on which the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and Security Council \r\nresolution 1244 (1999) are based. The call was made at a \r\ntime when we are witnessing a significant improvement \r\nbetween Serbia and Albania, as evinced by the first \r\nvisit of the Prime Minister of Albania to Belgrade after \r\n68 years.\r\nI would like to underline that all the outstanding \r\nissues in the process of normalization of relations \r\nbetween Belgrade and Pristina are being addressed in \r\nthe dialogue conducted in Brussels, with the facilitation \r\nof the European Union. Needless to say, statements such \r\nas those made by Prime Minister Rama may jeopardize \r\nthe positive results of the dialogue and set back its \r\nprogress in the future.\r\nResolving the status of Serbia’s southern province \r\nbelongs among my Government’s top priorities. We \r\nhave demonstrated time and time again our readiness \r\nto make an active contribution in the efforts to reach \r\na solutions that would be acceptable to all, taking into \r\naccount the legitimate interests of all communities in \r\nKosovo and Metohija.\r\nMr. Idrizi (Albania): I am taking the f loor in \r\nresponse to the statement just made by the representative \r\nof Serbia in reaction to the statement that the Prime \r\nMinister of Albania, His Excellency Mr. Edi Rama, \r\nmade this morning in the general debate. I wish I were \r\nnot compelled to do so, but I deem it very important to \r\nsay a few words to set the record straight.\r\nKosovo is an independent State recognized by 110 \r\ncountries. It is a member and active participant in all \r\nregional initiatives in South-East Europe and, like all \r\nthe other countries of the region, is part of the European \r\nUnion association and stabilization process. Since its \r\nindependence in 2008, Kosovo has firmly established \r\nand strengthened its worldwide geopolitical identity and \r\nhas been a much-praised contributor to peace, stability \r\nand cooperation in the region. Furthermore, Kosovo \r\nand Serbia are engaged in a successful dialogue that \r\nhas enabled the two countries to find common solutions \r\nfor a series of issues for both of their peoples. \r\nThere is so much to say on the fact that, with \r\nKosovo’s independence, our region closed once and for \r\nall the most bitter chapter in its modern history. That \r\ndevelopment has generated the most welcome positive \r\nenergy in the Balkans, including in our own relations \r\nwith Serbia, and raised the hopes of the people, \r\nespecially the young, in both countries. For the sake \r\nof time, however, I will limit myself to quoting from \r\nthe statement made by the Prime Minister at an earlier \r\nmeeting. \r\n“After 100 years of frozen or live conflicts and \r\nconfrontations in the Balkans, no guns were pointed \r\nat anyone’s window. After a century scarred by \r\nconflict, we have finally seen a year of cooperation \r\naimed at making the peace we have achieved a \r\npeace worth living.” (A/70/PV.25)\r\nThis is what Kosovo independence has brought \r\nto our region, to our part of the world, and certainly \r\nbeyond. We fully subscribe to this climate and have \r\ncontributed to it with dedication and perseverance, and \r\nwe will continue to do whatever we can for peace to \r\nprevail and further develop.\r\nMs. Demirel (Turkey): I am taking the f loor in \r\nresponse to the base allegations made by one delegation \r\ntoday, which we categorically deny. I shall refrain from \r\ntaking valuable time, but I would like to emphasize that \r\nTurkey will continue to stand by the people of Syria.\r\nMr. Li Yongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nChina would like to exercise its right of reply in regard \r\nto the statement made by the representative of the \r\nPhilippines.\r\nChina’s claim over the sovereignty of islands is \r\nbased on an adequate historical and legal foundation. \r\nThe illegal occupation and invasion of some islands and \r\nreefs and Nansha Islands in China by the Philippines \r\nis the root cause of the dispute between China and the \r\nPhilippines. I would like to explain that another name \r\nfor the Nansha Islands is the Spratly Islands.\r\nWithout the prior consent of China, the Philippines \r\nunilaterally and forcefully initiated arbitration. That \r\n15-29940 17/18\r\n02/10/2015 A/70/PV.27\r\nis against international law and an encroachment on \r\nthe legal rights and interests of China. China is firmly \r\nopposed to the practice by the Philippines of initiating \r\narbitration and has repeatedly indicated its position of \r\nnon-acceptance and non-participation. Our position has \r\nan adequate legal foundation that will not change.\r\nThe Philippines broke its own promise to seek a \r\nsettlement through consultations and negotiations \r\ndirectly. It unilaterally initiated and stubbornly \r\npressed for arbitration in an attempt to deny China’s \r\nterritorial sovereignty over the South China Sea and \r\nChina’s maritime rights in an attempt to force China \r\nto compromise. That is unrealistic and will not yield \r\nany results. China’s basic position on the South China \r\nSea issue is to seek a peaceful settlement on the basis \r\nof respecting historical facts and in accordance with \r\ninternational law through dialogue, consultations and \r\nnegotiations. China and the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) countries have already \r\nagreed on a dual-track approach in the matter; namely, \r\nsettlement should be sought through direct negotiations \r\nand consultations by the countries directly concerned. \r\nThe peace and stability of the South China Sea should \r\nbe jointly maintained by China and the ASEAN \r\ncountries. That is the most realistic and most effective \r\nway to properly address the South China Sea issue.\r\nInternationalizing and judicializing the South China \r\nSea issue will not be conducive to finding a settlement. \r\nOn the contrary, it will only make it more difficult \r\nand will jeopardize regional peace and security. China \r\nis firmly committed to maintaining regional peace \r\nand security in the South China Sea and will remain \r\ncommitted to turning the South China Sea into a sea of \r\npeace, friendship and cooperation. Meanwhile, China \r\nis firmly opposed to the practice of a small number \r\nof countries of stirring up the situation for selfish \r\npurposes and jeopardizing peace and stability in the \r\nSouth China Sea. China urges the Philippines to return \r\nto negotiations and consultations on the right track as \r\nearly as possible.\r\nMr. Meek (United Kingdom): I wish to exercise \r\nthe right of reply to some of the comments made by \r\nthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Mauritius earlier \r\ntoday. \r\nThe British Government has no doubt about the \r\nsovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, which has been \r\nBritish since 1814 and which it administers as the British \r\nIndian Ocean territory. No international tribunal, \r\nincluding the recent arbitral tribunal constituted under \r\nannex VII to the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea, has ever cast doubt on the United Kingdom’s \r\nsovereignty over the territory. \r\nMoreover, the United Kingdom does not recognize \r\nthe claim of the Republic of Mauritius to the sovereignty \r\nof the Chagos Archipelago. It has repeatedly undertaken \r\nto cede it to Mauritius when it is no longer required \r\nfor defence purposes. We maintain that commitment, \r\nalthough it is for the United Kingdom to determine \r\nwhen that condition is met. In the meantime, the \r\ndefence purposes contribute significantly towards \r\nglobal security and are central to efforts for countering \r\nregional threats, including those from terrorism and \r\npiracy. \r\nIt is clear that the recent Arbitral Tribunal award does \r\nnot have the effect of rendering the marine-protected \r\narea illegal. The tribunal found that there had been no \r\nimproper motive in its creation and explicitly stated that \r\nit took no view on the substance of the marine-protected \r\narea , a measure that preserves the Indian Ocean’s fish \r\nstocks and safeguards their importance for the economy \r\nand food security of the region. The tribunal’s finding \r\nwas actually more narrow — that the United Kingdom \r\nshould have consulted the Republic of Mauritius more \r\nfully about the establishment of the marine-protected \r\narea so as to give due regard to its rights.\r\nAs the tribunal noted in its final observation, it is \r\nopen to both parties to enter into such negotiations now \r\nand to do so without reference to matters of sovereignty \r\nunder a sovereignty umbrella. The United Kingdom \r\nhas made extensive efforts to engage the Republic \r\nof Mauritius about conservation matters. Following \r\nthe award, it has once again invited the Republic \r\nof Mauritius to join in bilateral consultations. We \r\nhope that the consultations will begin shortly and are \r\ncommitted to working with the Republic of Mauritius \r\nto explore all aspects of its interests in relation to the \r\nmarine-protected area .\r\nMr. Dery (the Philippines): We are exercising the \r\nright of reply. In response to China’s great concern for a \r\npeaceful settlement in the South China Sea, we observe \r\nthat the South China Sea is an international waterway \r\nand that that is an even stronger reason to settle any \r\ndisputes at the international level, under international \r\nlaw, including arbitration, pursuant to annex VII of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. We \r\ntherefore reiterate our invitation to the People’s Republic \r\n18/18 15-29940\r\nA/70/PV.27 02/10/2015\r\nof China to join us in the deliberations of the arbitral \r\ntribunal and to let the merits of the case be decided on \r\nthe basis of international law and with transparency, \r\nrather than recourse to coercion and intimidation.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nrepresentative of Serbia has asked to make a second \r\nstatement. \r\nMr. Holovka (Serbia): I will take further time at \r\nthis late hour only to set the facts straight. Kosovo \r\nis neither an independent State nor a Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Prime Minister of Albania is the \r\nonly speaker in the General Assembly who has called \r\nfor the recognition of part of a sovereign country. That \r\nis a hostile act. We take it very seriously. It is a hostile \r\nact not only towards a neighbouring country, Serbia, \r\nbut also towards his own people, some of whom inhabit \r\nthe province of Kosovo. Furthermore, it is a hostile \r\nact in relation to the dialogue held under the auspices \r\nof the European Union, where all outstanding issues \r\nin the process of normalization of relations between \r\nBelgrade and Pristina are being addressed. Let me be \r\nclear and stress once again that Serbia will continue to \r\nuse all diplomatic means to preserve its sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nrepresentative of China has asked to speak a second \r\ntime in exercise of the right of reply. \r\nMr. Li Yongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nI only wish to reiterate that the illegal invasion and \r\noccupation of some islands and reefs in the Nansha \r\nIslands of China is the root cause of the dispute between \r\nChina and the Philippines over the South China \r\nSea. Regarding the arbitration case initiated by the \r\nPhilippines, China’s position is that of non-acceptance \r\nand non-participation. Its position will not change.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8 p.m.\r\n"
