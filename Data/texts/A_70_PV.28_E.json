We must move forward \r\nin the still-pending reforms of the Organization. We \r\nmust work with renewed vigour on that task, especially \r\nwith regard to the Security Council. The adoption of \r\nthe new Agenda imposes on our countries numerous \r\nchallenges to which we are committed, but it also \r\nimposes challenges on the Organization, particularly \r\nwith regard to providing us with timely support to fulfil \r\nthe historic responsibility that we have assumed.\r\nWe have concluded a stage in world history marked \r\nby important progress in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. However, that progress has \r\nnot been sufficient. The fight against poverty and \r\ninequality goes on. Economic and financial crises \r\nhave aggravated the vulnerability of the poorest. In \r\naddition, the proliferation of conflicts throughout the \r\nworld and natural and human-made disasters have had \r\nan impact on the living conditions of many people in \r\nvarious parts of the world. Those conditions demand \r\nthat we bring about a genuine and sustainable global \r\ntransformation, which must include the restructuring \r\nof the international financial architecture, as well as \r\na rethinking of cooperation mechanisms with a view \r\nto transforming them into transparent and efficient \r\nmechanisms that meet the needs of human development.\r\nI believe that we must pay special attention to the \r\nissue of sovereign debt. The negative impact of debt \r\nservicing on development needs and on the effective \r\nenjoyment of human rights in our countries is enormous, \r\nbecause it directly affects the capacity of the State \r\nto generate public investment and stimulate private \r\ninvestment. That in turn impedes the fulfillment of the \r\ngoals related to development. It is therefore a priority to \r\nestablish a debt restructuring mechanism that promotes \r\na just and shared distribution of responsibility between \r\ndebtors and creditors by adopting an approach centred \r\non human needs. \r\nWe know that for the success of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, a new vision of international \r\ncooperation is required. To that end, we must work to \r\nchange the current structure of development financing \r\nand strengthen South-South cooperation without delay.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.28\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n28th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 3 October 2015, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nMy country recognizes the importance of the fact \r\nthat in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), adopted by the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Summit, special mention is made of \r\nmigrants as a vulnerable group, and of their undoubted \r\ncontribution to sustainable development in the \r\ncountries in which they live. El Salvador insists that the \r\ninternational community, the organizations involved \r\nin migration issues, those defending migrants and \r\nhuman rights in general — but especially the United \r\nNations — should take up the challenge with courage \r\nand guide the actions of their agencies, resources and \r\nprogrammes to strengthen cooperation initiatives in \r\nthe field of international migration in all its facets. In \r\nthe various migration crises we face, we must not lose \r\nsight of the fact that we are dealing with human beings, \r\nwhose rights and development we should guarantee.\r\nI take this opportunity to highlight the special \r\ncontribution that Latin America and its regional \r\norganizations have made to multilateralism. Their \r\nvaluable proposals and initiatives have contributed to \r\npromoting and making progress on issues that are very \r\nrelevant to the international agenda, such as migration, \r\nthe environment, disarmament, human rights, \r\ngender empowerment and equality, and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, among others. All of the efforts that \r\nwe have undertaken as a region have been extremely \r\nvaluable in the progress of the multilateral agenda, and \r\nthey have been aimed at strengthening solidarity and \r\ncooperation among the peoples of the world. \r\nIn that context, we should mention the regional \r\nefforts made by the Central American Integration \r\nSystem, particularly in the area of security, which \r\ncomplement the regional efforts and the national efforts \r\nundertaken by each of our countries.\r\nIn the area of security, as members know, El \r\nSalvador is waging an unprecedented war against \r\norganized crime through its El Salvador Seguro plan, \r\nwhich, like the Central American Security Strategy, \r\nhas four main components: crime prevention, crime \r\nprosecution, rehabilitation and reintegration, and the \r\nstrengthening of the institutions that fight crime. We \r\nhave committed a major part of our national resources \r\nto this effort, but the scope of the challenge forces us \r\nto come to the international community to request its \r\nstrong support and solidarity, so that we may win this \r\ngood fight against criminal groups that threaten the \r\npeace of our families.\r\nMoreover, in relation to the global drug problem, \r\nI wish to emphasize the coming special session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on drugs, to be held next April in \r\nthis Hall. The special session in 2016 will give us an \r\nopportunity to revitalize the dialogue and exchange \r\ngood experiences so that we can assess the progress \r\nmade in complying with our international obligations \r\nto combat drugs and to work at the same time on the \r\nchallenges to be overcome at the global level. \r\nEl Salvador is pleased and honoured, as the \r\ncoordinator of the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nGroup, to have the opportunity to represent the Latin \r\nAmerican region at meetings of the preparatory \r\ncommittee for that event. We will seek close and \r\neffective coordination so that the debates and dialogues \r\nmove towards the definition of a comprehensive vision \r\nof an international policy against drugs based on the \r\nwelfare of the individual and respect for his or her \r\nrights.\r\nFurthermore, in the context of the importance that \r\nmy country attaches to controlling the arms trade as \r\nan effective means of reducing the violence plaguing \r\nCentral America, El Salvador supportsrelevant \r\ninternational regulation to combat organized crime \r\nso as to prevent the human suffering caused by \r\nirresponsible transfers of weapons. I fervently appeal \r\nto the international community to work together \r\non the effective implementation of the Arms Trade \r\nTreaty and its universalization. Let us not forget that \r\ndecisive action in that area means nothing less than \r\nthe difference between life and death for thousands of \r\nindividuals in the world.\r\nAt the same time, El Salvador, as a country that has \r\nbenefited from peacekeeping operations, recognizes \r\nthat mechanism as a legitimate and effective measure \r\nfor ending conflicts in countries and regions. On that \r\ncount and as part of our staunch commitment to peace \r\nand international security, my country will continue to \r\nparticipate in United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\nthrough its contributions of military and police \r\npersonnel. We will continue to work to strengthen our \r\nparticipation by deploying units under their own flag. \r\nWe also support all the initiatives aimed at ensuring the \r\nparticipation of women in the various contingents, as \r\nprovided for in Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \r\nand subsequent Council resolutions.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to recall the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\n15-29946 3/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nmust be aware that they are still valid and should be \r\nrespected by  all Member States in the process of \r\nchange that we have begun. \r\nIn that context, we should also mention the \r\nprocess of detente that has begun between Cuba and \r\nthe United States of America, a process that has had a \r\npositive impact not only on the relations between the \r\ntwo countries, but also on the continent as a whole. \r\nEl Salvador is pleased with the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States \r\nof America and trusts that in the current favourable \r\nclimate, the will expressed to lift the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba will \r\nbecome a reality as soon as possible.\r\nI am convinced that with a will and with effort, we \r\ncan all build an international order based on promoting \r\npeace, security and sustainable development, protecting \r\nhuman rights, eradicating poverty and reducing \r\ninequalities. E1 Salvador stands ready to face that \r\nchallenge and is committed to working to that end.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Yousef Bin Al-Alawi Bin Abdulla, Minister of \r\nState for Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of Oman.\r\nMr. Abdulla (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate you, Sir, and your \r\ncountry, the Kingdom of Denmark, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. We trust that your diplomatic experience will \r\ngreatly impact the success of this session. We are ready \r\nto work with you, Sir, and all the delegations of Member \r\nStates so as to accomplish our goals and objectives, \r\nparticularly in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and in the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nWe are also pleased to express our appreciation to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the friendly Republic of Uganda, for his able \r\nstewardship of the Assembly at the previous session. \r\nI would also like to take this opportunity pay tribute \r\nonce again to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ntireless efforts to improve the work of the Organization \r\nin order to meet the aspirations of all Member States.\r\nThis session coincides with the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the establishment of the United Nations. \r\nThe occasion represents an opportunity to renew our \r\nconfidence in joint international action through the \r\nadoption of positive initiatives that could contribute to \r\nthe creation of an international economic order based \r\non justice for all States and nations.\r\nSince the dawn of the Omani renaissance on \r\n23 July 1970, we in the Sultanate of Oman have \r\nembraced peace and dialogue as basic principles. \r\nThat is because we are convinced that dialogue is \r\nthe most logical foundation upon which all forms of \r\nconflict can be resolved. Throughout the history of the \r\nUnited Nations, humankind has sought to strengthen \r\nconfidence through agreed and conciliatory ideas and \r\nthe principles of the United Nations Charter, which \r\nhelp to deepen and widen common interests and mutual \r\nbenefits. We also believe that dialogue is a peaceful \r\nmeans of settling disputes, and its use is preferable to \r\nresorting to confrontation and conflict.\r\nFrom that perspective, my country welcomed the \r\nagreement reached between the P5+1 and the friendly \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on the Iranian nuclear \r\nprogramme. Despite the fact that that breakthrough \r\ntook great effort and a considerable amount of time, \r\nit can serve as a model for solving controversial and \r\ncomplicated issues among countries through dialogue, \r\nnegotiation and the balancing of international interests. \r\nWe hope that that historic agreement will have a positive \r\nimpact on regional and international peace and security \r\nand pave the way for a new era of relations based on \r\ncooperation, respect and mutual trust.\r\nThe raising of the f lag of the State of Palestine as an \r\nobserver State at the United Nations, though a symbolic \r\ngesture, reminds us of the tragedy of the Palestinian \r\npeople and their aspirations to attain fulfilment of \r\ntheir legitimate rights. We call on the Palestinians and \r\nthe Israelis alike to return to the negotiating table and \r\nwork on achieving the vision of two independent States \r\nliving side by side, through steps that would secure \r\nthe interests of both parties, based on the pillars of the \r\nArab Peace Initiative and the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions. We also call upon the United Nations and \r\nthe parties sponsoring the peace process in the Middle \r\nEast to make greater efforts to reach an agreement \r\nfor the settlement of the crisis, instead of merely to \r\nmanaging it.\r\nMy country also follows with great concern the \r\ndevelopments in the crisis in the brotherly Republic of \r\nYemen, which has resulted in disastrous humanitarian \r\ntragedies. While we understand the circumstances \r\nthat provoked the crisis, we continue to believe that \r\nthe political parties in Yemen are capable of restoring \r\nsecurity and stability to the country. We are deeply \r\n4/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nconcerned that the continuation of violence in Yemen \r\nhas enabled several terrorist organizations, including \r\nthose on United Nations watch lists, to use Yemen as \r\na base for their terrorist activities. That poses a direct \r\nthreat to the region’s security and stability.\r\nWe call upon all political forces in Yemen to \r\nsupport the efforts of the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nEnvoy, Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, to contribute to \r\nthe restoration of peace and stability in the Republic of \r\nYemen and to enable the achievement of the aspirations \r\nof the brotherly Yemeni people to a safe and dignified \r\nlife. My country also expresses its strong condemnation \r\nof the targeting of diplomatic and consular premises in \r\nYemen’s capital, Sana’a. We call on all parties to respect \r\nthe rules of international law and refrain from any acts \r\nthat violate their international obligations, particularly \r\nthose set forth in the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \r\nRelations of 1961 and the Vienna Convention on \r\nConsular Relations of 1963.\r\nAs the Syrian crisis has now entered its fifth year, \r\nthe Syrian people continue to suffer; hundreds of \r\nthousands have left their homes and risked their lives \r\nin circumstances unprecedented in modern history. \r\nWe call upon all Syrian parties and neighbouring \r\ncountries to support the mission of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Special Envoy, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, to \r\nrestore security and stability to that brotherly country \r\nand contribute to the eradication of the terrorism that \r\nhas been able to find a foothold in Syria and currently \r\nposes a threat to regional and international security. My \r\ncountry reiterates its firm and uncompromising stance \r\nin condemning all forms of terrorism, without regard to \r\ntheir causes and motivations.\r\nWhile we commend the humanitarian efforts by \r\ncountries and regional and international organizations \r\nto alleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, we \r\nappeal to the international community to do even more \r\nto protect the brotherly Syrian people at home and \r\nabroad. In that respect, we would like to emphasize the \r\ncontinuation of the humanitarian programme offered \r\nby the Sultanate of Oman to help Syrian refugees.\r\nMy country stresses the importance of maintaining \r\nthe universality of the nuclear non-proliferation regime. \r\nThat can be achieved only by strengthening the three \r\npillars of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT), namely, nuclear disarmament, nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation and the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy. In that context, we call upon the sponsors of \r\nthe Treaty to fully implement the resolution of the 1995 \r\nNPT Review Conference on making the Middle East a \r\nregion free from nuclear weapons and other weapons \r\nof mass destruction. That would help safeguard the \r\ncredibility and universality of that important treaty.\r\nResolution 55/2, containing the Millennium \r\nDeclaration, is considered an important document, \r\nas it sets forth an ambitious international programme \r\nto assist countries achieve high levels of economic \r\nand social development. However, the weakness of \r\nthe global economy over the past 20 years has had \r\nserious social repercussions, including an increase \r\nin number of unemployed, which has crippled the \r\nability of many countries to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Bearing that in mind, we call upon \r\nthe international community to put the issues of the \r\neconomy, trade and the environment at the forefront of \r\nthe urgent issues that need to be addressed. The first \r\nand foremost of those issues is the international energy \r\ntrade, since it is crucial that the international trade in \r\nenergy, specifically the price of oil and its by-products, \r\nbe properly organized.\r\nMy country looks forward to the convening of the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Paris. We hope that participating countries \r\ncan agree on a balanced international programme that \r\ntakes into account the concerns and interests of all \r\ndeveloping and developed countries.\r\nWe are facing real challenges that we must tackle \r\nresolutely if we are to ensure that we are not hindering \r\ndevelopment but encouraging it in a way that helps \r\nus to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nWe therefore believe that the next phase of joint \r\ninternational action requires that the members of the \r\ninternational community expand their concept of \r\ngenuine partnership and shared destiny. We hope that \r\nthis session succeeds and that the goals of the United \r\nNations will be accomplished.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Péter Szijjártó, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade of Hungary.\r\nMr. Szijjártó (Hungary): I am pleased to be \r\naddressing the General Assembly on the occasion of \r\nthis seventieth anniversary. \r\nSeventy years ago, the United Nations was founded \r\nto promote cooperation among its Member States and \r\n15-29946 5/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nto establish international peace and security. That \r\nwould be a good reason to celebrate, but here we are, 70 \r\nyears later, and if we are frank with one another —and \r\nwe should be — it is obvious that there are no major \r\nreasons to be satisfied or to celebrate. That is because, \r\non the seventieth anniversary of the foundation of the \r\nUnited Nations, it is not an exaggeration to say that in \r\nthe years since the end of Second World War, Europe, \r\nwhere I come from, has not had to face at any one time \r\nchallenges as numerous and as serious as those that it \r\nis facing now. And if we are talking about the world as \r\nthe whole, putting things in a global context, we can \r\nsay that since the end of the Cold War, the world has \r\nnot had to face as many simultaneous difficulties as it \r\nis facing now.\r\nOver the past five years, we have seen 15 wars \r\nand armed conflicts launched or renewed. And now \r\nEurope is facing a war as well. A couple of years ago, \r\nwe would not have thought that Europe would have to \r\nface a war again in the twenty-first century, but now \r\nthat has happened. There is a war going on in Ukraine, \r\nin our neighbourhood; and if we look at the eastern \r\nregion of Europe, we see a series of frozen conflicts \r\nand territorial disputes. The European Union runs a \r\nprogramme called the Eastern Partnership, through \r\nwhich we promote cooperation with six former Soviet \r\nrepublics that would like to have some type of European \r\nperspective. But Belarus is the only country of the six \r\nthat is not involved in some kind of territorial dispute \r\nor frozen conflict.\r\nAnd Europe still faces economic challenges. I do \r\nnot want to discuss that in detail, since another entire \r\ngeneral debate would not be enough to lay out all the \r\neconomic and trade challenges that we have been \r\ndealing with, but what I can say is that Europe, whose \r\nshare of the world’s population is between 7 and 8 per \r\ncent, produces 15 to 16 per cent of the world’s gross \r\ndomestic product and at the same time contributes \r\n50 per cent of the world’s spending on social welfare. \r\nOne does not have to be an economist to see that that is \r\nan unsustainable situation.\r\nCurrently, however, the European Union is \r\nconfronting the most complicated challenge that it \r\nhas seen since its foundation, namely, mass migration. \r\nUnfortunately, we have not been able to find the right \r\nanswers — yet. That is because we have no consensus \r\nin Europe, or worldwide either, about the nature, size \r\nand volume of this mass migration. \r\nIn that regard, I should underline that what we are \r\nfacing is not a refugee crisis. It is much greater and \r\nmore complicated than that. We are situated on the \r\nmost travelled migration route, and I have to say that \r\nthis mass migration is composed of asylum seekers, \r\neconomic migrants and also, unfortunately, some \r\nforeign fighters.\r\nAs far as its size is concerned, this mass migration \r\nhas an unlimited supply of people, and if we cannot \r\nstop the influx soon, the problem will stay with us for \r\na long time. I totally agree with the statement made by \r\nthe Secretary-General at the start of the general debate \r\nto the effect that there have never been so many people \r\non the move as there are right now (see A/70/PV.13). \r\nThere are 60 million people all over the world who have \r\nhad to leave their homes because of armed conflicts or \r\nwars, and in 2014 we saw the biggest increase of all \r\nin the numbers of migrants and refugees. There have \r\nnot been this many refugees, migrants and internally \r\ndisplaced persons (IDPs) at one time since the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\nwas established.\r\nThere are two reasons for that. One is that there has \r\nbeen a series of bad international political decisions, in \r\nwhich Europe was not the only participant. The other \r\nis that the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) \r\nhas been gaining additional territory. If we are honest \r\nwith one another, we have had only limited success \r\nso far in fighting ISIS. Owing to those two reasons, a \r\nsignificant part of the Middle East and North Africa \r\nhas been destabilized. As a result, more than 8 million \r\npeople in Iraq and more than 12.2 million in Syria now \r\nlive on humanitarian aid. \r\nIn Afghanistan, after the mission of the International \r\nSecurity Assistance Force concluded, the international \r\nmilitary presence there was to be reduced by 90 per \r\ncent. There are already 1 million Afghan refugees in \r\nIran and 1.5 million in Pakistan. We have not even \r\nmentioned the struggles in Libya and the lack of a unity \r\nGovernment there; we have not mentioned Boko Haram \r\nor sub-Saharan Africa, where there are already more \r\nthan 12.5 million IDPs.\r\nIn the meantime, we also need to focus on the fight \r\nagainst climate change, in which our success so far \r\nhas also been limited, since the average temperature \r\non Earth has increased by almost 1 per cent since the \r\nlast century. Global warming leads to rising sea levels, \r\nwhich lead to extreme weather conditions, which lead \r\n6/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nto droughts, a lack of food, and because of that, to \r\nfurther migration movements. Today, there are between \r\n25 and 30 million people who are migrants because of \r\nenvironmental conditions, and some forecasts say that \r\nby 2050 there could be around 100 million. \r\nThe overall picture we are seeing is one of a \r\ndestabilized region in the Middle East and North Africa, \r\nwith 15 new armed conflicts and wars in the past five \r\nyears and limited success in combating climate change \r\nand water shortages. And it is obvious that for those \r\nthree reasons, a mass global migration has begun.\r\n“Global” is the most important word here. We have \r\nto agree that this is a global challenge. And if mass \r\nmigration is a global challenge, we need a global answer, \r\na global solution with global participation. Currently, \r\nit is Europe, or more precisely the European Union, \r\nthat is bearing most of the burden of the latest waves \r\nof mass migration. I have to say that if that does not \r\nchange, if we cannot regain control over our borders, if \r\nwe cannot reduce the influx and the pressure, Europe \r\ncould be destabilized as well, first at the periphery and \r\nthen even at the centre. I would therefore like to stress \r\nagain that this is a global challenge that needs a global \r\nanswer, a global solution based on global participation.\r\nWhat should be done? In principle, instead of \r\naddressing only the consequences, we should handle \r\nthe root causes. That is the key issue. For that we have \r\na five-point proposal. First, we have to increase our \r\ninternational efforts to combat ISIS. Secondly, we have \r\nto stabilize the situation in the region of North Africa \r\nand the Middle East. Thirdly, we have to create a system \r\nof world quotas for the relocation of migrants. Fourthly, \r\nwe have to continue and strengthen United Nations \r\nmissions. And fifthly, we have to fully implement the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. If we are not able to \r\ncomply with those five requirements, I doubt that we \r\nwill be able to address the challenges entirely.\r\nWith respect to ISIS, we need to take into account \r\nthat, although we have put together a very broad \r\nmilitary coalition, we have so far achieved only limited \r\nsuccess. ISIS is still acquiring additional territory, \r\nkilling people and committing brutal crimes. We have \r\nall seen the videos. ISIS has caused more damage to our \r\ncommon historical heritage than all armed conflicts in \r\nthe world since the end of the Second World War. So we \r\nhave to increase our efforts and take coordinated action. \r\nThere also needs to be close cooperation between the \r\ntransatlantic community and the Russian Federation.\r\nHungary has already done its homework. We have \r\ndeployed 112 troops in Iraqi Kurdistan. Our original \r\nmission was to act as a force protection unit but, \r\nbased on a request from the United States, we are now \r\nparticipating in training Peshmerga troops as well. We \r\nmust not forget that ISIS has committed crimes against \r\nhumanity, so we urge the International Criminal Court \r\nto investigate and sanction those brutal crimes properly.\r\nMy second point was that we have to create stability \r\nin the region of the Middle East and North Africa. The \r\nmajor challenge there is Syria, but it is obvious that if we \r\nfail to make peace in Syria, then the migration pressure \r\non Europe will not decrease. The only acceptable \r\nmeans, and maybe the only successful means, is \r\nthrough negotiations. There I agree with the German \r\nChancellor, who said that we have to ensure maximum \r\npolitical inclusiveness. That might be the successful \r\nway to settle the conflict in Syria. That returns us to \r\nthe critical point that there will be no forward progress \r\nand no possibility for resolving the crisis in Syria \r\nunless there is agreement and cooperation between the \r\ntransatlantic community and the Russian Federation. \r\nIf we study the nature of mass migration, we see that \r\nmigrants are usually transported by human traffickers. \r\nThat is why I urge the international community to \r\ntake international action to harmonize and tighten its \r\nlegislation against human trafficking.\r\nThirdly, there should be a system of world quotas. \r\nFor that reason, we ask the Secretary-General to prepare \r\na proposal to ensure that we address the challenge \r\nglobally and that all major players in global politics and \r\neconomics do their part to share the burden.\r\nMy fourth point was that we have to maintain and \r\nincrease the efforts of United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions. If we are successful in peacekeeping missions \r\nand if we are capable of creating peace in unstable parts \r\nof the world, then we can hope to successfully handle \r\nthe migration crisis. Hungarian troops have taken part \r\nin missions in Cyprus, Western Sahara and Lebanon. \r\nWe support those missions, and we urge the United \r\nNations to increase its efforts in that regard. However, \r\nuntil long-term solutions are in place, we Europeans \r\nwill have to take effective short-term measures to avoid \r\nbecoming unstable ourselves as a result of the heavy \r\npressure.\r\nOur first task in that regard is to regain control over \r\nour borders. If we cannot regain control over Europe’s \r\nborders, we will not be able to stop the influx of migrants \r\n15-29946 7/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nand we will be defenceless. It is our responsibilty to \r\nestablish a joint European Union force to protect the \r\nexternal borders of the European Union. Our second \r\ntask is that we must pay tribute to all those countries, \r\nsuch as Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, that have been \r\nbearing enormous burdens to properly supply and treat \r\nrefugees. We cannot, of course, expect them to bear that \r\nburden on their own. They are now caring for hundreds \r\nof thousands or even millions of migrants and refugees. \r\nSo we propose that the European Union take over the \r\nfinancing of the refugee camps and, if more camps are \r\nnecessary, then we must finance them. Here we would \r\nlike to ask the Secretary-General to consider how the \r\nUnited Nations can increase its efforts to help Turkey, \r\nJordan and Lebanon and how it can share the burden \r\nrelating to migrants and refugees.\r\nFinally, I would like to draw members’ attention to \r\nthe danger of anti-Muslim policies spreading throughout \r\nEurope or even beyond. We must stress that the Muslim \r\nfaith has nothing to do with the root causes of this mass \r\nmigration. I come from Hungary, a Christian country, \r\nand a Christian approach does not tolerate anti-Muslim \r\npolicies. We honour and respect the Muslim faith, and \r\nwe would like to cooperate, as we must, in addressing \r\nthe root causes of mass migration.\r\nTo summarize, mass migration is a global challenge. \r\nWe must respond globally. All major players must \r\ncontribute. The burden must be shared. The United \r\nNations should play a leading role in that initiative. \r\nWe are ready to work together according to the agreed \r\nSustainable Development Goals, which call for action \r\nto ensure that migration is safe, orderly and regulated.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Osman Mohammed Saleh, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the State of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Saleh (Eritrea): It is my pleasure, at the outset, \r\nto warmly congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. I also wish to extend my deep appreciation to \r\nyour predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for \r\nhis commendable efforts in conducting the business of \r\nthe sixty-ninth session of the Assembly.\r\nSeventy years after the birth of the United Nations, \r\nwith its promise of peace, justice and development \r\nfor all and its call for all nations to act in concert for \r\nthe common good, it is undeniable, however, that we \r\ncontinue to live in an unfair and unequal world — a \r\nworld where conflicts and wars rage, where extreme \r\npoverty persists in the midst of plenty, where children \r\ndie from easily preventable diseases and where justice \r\nis routinely trampled.\r\nThe United Nations is itself a reflection of the \r\nunfair, unequal and undemocratic global order. In the \r\nUnited Nations, the overwhelming majority of Member \r\nStates are marginalized. The General Assembly, which \r\nshould be the most powerful organ, is bereft of real \r\npower and influence. Power and decision-making are \r\ndominated by a few among the few. Two decades of talk \r\nto reform the Organization have yielded zero results. \r\nThe resistance of those who believe that they benefit \r\nfrom the current configuration is so stiff and the ranks \r\nof those who seek change are so divided by approaches \r\ndriven by narrow national interests that the enthusiasm \r\nfor reform is giving way to a disquieting paralysis.\r\nYet all Member States, peoples and political and \r\nsocial forces that thirst for peace, justice, equitable \r\nsocioeconomic development and the protection and \r\nenhancement of the environment must not give up. We \r\nneed to persist in our efforts to rebuild and revitalize the \r\nUnited Nations. We need to strengthen our solidarity \r\nand defend the time-tested principles of the equal \r\nsovereignty of nations, respect for territorial integrity, \r\npeaceful coexistence, the right of nations to choose \r\ntheir social and economic path of development, respect \r\nfor the dignity and rights of citizens and migrants, \r\nand fidelity to the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law. We need to work and cooperate \r\nat the national, regional and global levels to achieve \r\nsustainable and equitable development, a lofty goal that \r\nunderpins peace and social justice.\r\nWe need to fight to avert an environmental \r\ncatastrophe that awaits humankind and threatens \r\nhuman civilization. That will require more than human \r\ningenuity and advances in science and technology. We \r\nmust realize that there can be no technological fix to the \r\nenvironmental challenge. It will require radical change \r\naway from economic and social systems based on \r\ngreed, the maximization of profits for the few, massive \r\ninequality, and unsustainable and unhealthy patterns of \r\nconsumption and gross wastage.\r\nEritrea is committed to striving for a fair, just, \r\ntruly representative and effective United Nations, \r\nbecause it was and still is a victim of the United Nations \r\nand the Powers that have dominated the Organization. \r\nSix decades ago, we were denied our inalienable right \r\nto self-determination and independence. For three \r\n8/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\ndecades, we were savagely bombed from the air and \r\nthe ground, with the aim of crushing our liberation \r\nstruggle; and today we are being subjected to unfair \r\nand illegitimate sanctions and baseless accusations. \r\nThe United Nations and its Security Council continue \r\nto countenance the illegal occupation of our sovereign \r\nterritory in violation of international law and several \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nDespite that hostility and injustice, Eritrea achieved \r\nindependence by dint of a heroic struggle against \r\ntremendous odds. Today, Eritrea is making remarkable \r\nprogress in building a nation based on citizenship and \r\ninclusiveness and respect for human dignity and rights. \r\nIt is peaceful, stable, secure and harmonious, achieving \r\nunity in diversity, with its people animated by a common \r\nstruggle and committed to a common future. It has \r\navoided the pitfalls of sectarianism, radicalization and \r\nterrorism that have infected the surrounding region and \r\nmany other areas in the world.\r\nMr. Alyemany (Yemen), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nOn another front, Eritrea is building a solid \r\nbasis for sustainable development with social justice \r\nby prioritizing education, health, agriculture, \r\nindustrialization, infrastructure, science and technology, \r\nall within a framework of regional cooperation and \r\nintegration in the Horn of Africa and the Gulf region \r\nacross the Red Sea. Eritrea welcomes the adoption of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals contained in the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), which are in accord with its development vision \r\nand priorities, and is determined to achieve them ahead \r\nof the 2030 deadline.\r\nMaintaining its focus on development, Eritrea is \r\nfighting human trafficking and is working to stabilize \r\nillegal migration and give youth and women adequate \r\nopportunities to pursue a high quality of life and build \r\ntheir nation. Eritrea is also making its contribution to \r\nregional peace, stability and security in the Red Sea \r\nregion and the Horn of Africa. Eritrea sees its own \r\nefforts to promote peace, justice, development and \r\nenvironmental protection as part of the global struggle \r\nfor a better, fairer and more equitable world and for \r\na strong, effective and truly representative United \r\nNations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now give \r\nthe f loor to His Excellency Mr. François Louncény Fall, \r\nMinister of State and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nGuineans Abroad of the Republic of Guinea.\r\nMr. Fall (Guinea) (spoke in French): Seventy \r\nyears ago, the United Nations was born with the aim of \r\ncreating a world of peace, security and economic and \r\nsocial progress. Transformed by those noble ideals, we \r\nhave together extinguished many hotbeds of tension, \r\nsown the seeds of trust among peoples, restored hope \r\nto the people and paved the way for prosperity for all \r\nnations. Beyond those undeniable achievements, the \r\nstate of the world motivates us to consider the way \r\nforward to assure our people of true tranquillity that \r\nwill enable them to thrive in harmony in a safer and \r\nmore equitable environment.\r\nIndeed, peace, security and human rights remain \r\nthe foundation of our prosperity. We must, therefore, \r\nrecognize that the prosperity we wish to share is \r\nseriously threatened by new barriers to stability and \r\nuniversal progress. Violence is resurfacing, driven by \r\nextremism and intolerance. Development for all remains \r\na struggle owing to entrenched extreme poverty and its \r\ncorollaries. Exclusion, a source of frustration, threatens \r\ndemocracy and good governance. There are so many \r\naspects that feed the tragic migration f lows — a true \r\nbleeding of the productive forces of the South that \r\nrequires an urgent, comprehensive and lasting response.\r\nOur commitment to peacekeeping materialized \r\nfirst in the Middle East, but that region is today once \r\nagain being subjected to shocks that inflict the worst \r\nsort of suffering on its peoples by denying them their \r\nfundamental rights to freedom, dignity and well-being.\r\nPalestine is still occupied. Its people should enjoy \r\nall their rights within the limits of a State with secure \r\nand internationally recognized borders, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. We urge the international \r\ncommunity to do everything possible for the \r\nresumption of negotiations between Israel and the State \r\nof Palestine, which are fated to live side by side. That \r\nis the way to ensure security in that part of the world, \r\nwhich is plunged into the throes of a many-sided crisis \r\nwith tragic humanitarian consequences.\r\nAfrica, which is gradually emerging from its \r\nstagnation to enjoy renewed growth, is investing in \r\nmechanisms for capacity-building in the defence \r\nand security sectors in the framework of responsible \r\nautonomy for the stability of its States. It goes without \r\nsaying that our efforts will seek to eliminate all the \r\nhotbeds of tension that stand in the way of democratic \r\n15-29946 9/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nprogress at a time when we are witnessing a f lare-up of \r\nterrorism whose ramifications from now on will leave \r\nno region untouched. We must find the ways and the \r\nmeans to check that scourge, which strikes our peoples \r\nat their very core, attacks our national symbols and \r\nleads to profound humanitarian crises.\r\nIt is clear that this wager can be won only with \r\na participatory, concerted approach on the part of \r\nour peoples and countries to defining inclusive \r\ndevelopment policies and programmes as a bulwark \r\nagainst marginalization, which causes frustration \r\nand withdrawal. This wager also depends on our \r\ndetermination to eliminate economic inequalities and \r\nsocial disparities in order to maintain global stability. \r\nThe challenge is therefore to dedicate democratic \r\nculture as a guarantor of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms as the foundations of more just and more \r\nequitable international relations.\r\nWe have just adopted the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, which integrates the economic, social and \r\nenvironmental dimensions of sustainable development. \r\nAchieving the 17 Goals of that ambitious programme \r\nwill clearly demand the mobilization of resources \r\nsufficient to guarantee, inter alia, decent jobs for young \r\npeople and to equip women with the skills necessary for \r\ntheir full potential and empowerment. \r\nHowever, that will be possible only in a healthy, \r\nprotected environment. That is why we hope that the \r\nupcoming twenty-first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Paris will lead to a binding \r\nagreement that ensures the survival of our planet. We \r\nurge all Member States and partners to contribute to the \r\nGreen Climate Fund.\r\nProsperity cannot be built on instability. The \r\ninternational community has the obligation to assume \r\nthe responsibilty for making our planet a safe place \r\nwhere the creative genius of humankind can f lourish. \r\nIt is up to us, under the umbrella of global partnership, \r\nto strengthen our collective action to spread peace \r\nacross the universe in order to crystallize the ideals that \r\ninspired the creation of our Organization. To do that, \r\nwe must adapt our vision of the management of global \r\naffairs to the current reality. \r\nIt cannot be said often enough: the international \r\nsystem must be reformed. It must allow us all to fully \r\nparticipate in the world’s evolution. The time has come \r\nto make  the United Nations the springboard for the \r\nemergence and spread of a truly global society. The time \r\nhas come to turn this prestigious place into a mold for \r\nshared solidarity. It is high time to turn this marvellous \r\ntool into a temple for the promotion of peace, equity \r\nand justice.\r\nGuinea remains convinced of the need to strengthen \r\nthe role of the General Assembly and to democratize the \r\nSecurity Council. That is why we welcome the initiative \r\nof France and Mexico to limit the use of the right of veto \r\nin cases of mass atrocities. Still, that measure aimed at \r\npreserving peace and respect for human rights must be \r\nuniversal, equitable and applicable to all regions of the \r\nworld.\r\nDétente, a key concept in international relations, is \r\nindispensable to the global equilibrium. The peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Iranian nuclear issue and the long-\r\nawaited rapprochement between the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba that should lead to the lifting of \r\nthe embargo constitute important steps in establishing \r\na climate of peace and security conducive to the \r\npromotion of mutually advantageous cooperation. \r\nHistory has demonstrated once again that by choosing \r\nthe virtues of negotiation and dialogue over the use of \r\nforce it is possible to work through the most serious \r\ndifferences.\r\nOur firm belief in the efficiency of multilateralism \r\nremains unshakeable. It is the only option for addressing \r\nthe ever more numerous and complex challenges that \r\nstand in the way of the progress our peoples so deeply \r\nyearn for. Our country will spare no effort to participate \r\nin that uplifting endeavour, above all at a moment when \r\nGuinea is joining the democratic dynamic by holding \r\na transparent presidential election on 11 October. \r\nIn that regard, I would like to commend the leading \r\nrole of the United Nations and all our partners in the \r\ndialogue process that led to the signing on 20 August of \r\nthe comprehensive agreement between the presidential \r\nmovement and the opposition. For our country, this \r\nelection will mark a new beginning towards genuine \r\neconomic and social development.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nMoreover, Guinea welcomes the goodwill of the \r\ninternational community, which has consistently \r\nsupported us in our efforts to realize the legitimate \r\nhopes of our people. The exceptional mobilization of \r\nthe international community in the fight to eradicate \r\nthe Ebola epidemic, along with its commitment to \r\n10/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nsupporting our reconstruction programme, is part of \r\nthat spirit of solidarity. \r\nThat is why, as we express our warmest \r\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, we already \r\ncomprehend the immense task that awaits you, for which \r\nGuinea will provide unstinting support. You will surely \r\nbenefit from the positive actions of your predecessor, \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa, whose dedication and accomplishment \r\ngave greater impetus to our collective commitment. \r\nAlong with the activity of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, who has earned our congratulations and \r\nencouragement because of his invaluable contribution \r\nto strengthening multilateralism, your actions, \r\nMr.  President, will help to make the United Nations \r\nmore responsive to the legitimate hopes of humankind.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Francine Baron, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nCaribbean Community Affairs of the Commonwealth \r\nof Dominica.\r\nMs. Baron (Dominica): Several weeks ago, as we \r\nprepared to address this historic seventieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly on the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and in the general debate, we pondered issues \r\nof significance to our country, our region, small \r\nisland developing States (SIDS) and our planet. We \r\ndecided then, as we have done in the past, that we must \r\nhighlight the challenges brought about by the increasing \r\nconcentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere \r\nand the resulting changes in global climate. That is \r\na major threat to our planet, with a disproportionate \r\nimpact on SIDS.\r\nOur concerns have been magnified since \r\n27 August, when Tropical Storm Erika brought with it \r\nup to 18 inches of rain in 16 hours in Dominica, with \r\na concentration of heavy continuous rainfall over a \r\nfive-hour period. The intensity of the rainfall led to \r\nrapid f lash f looding and numerous landslides in several \r\ncommunities. Dominica was severely impacted, with \r\n13 people confirmed dead and 17 still missing, while \r\nroads, bridges, houses, public buildings and the main \r\nairport were devastated. Two communities in the south \r\nof Dominica had to be evacuated, displacing hundreds \r\nof families.\r\nAccording to an initial assessment conducted by \r\nthe World Bank, the Government of Dominica and \r\nother partners, Tropical Storm Erika caused losses \r\nand damage to infrastructure in the amount of up to \r\n1.3 billion East Caribbean dollars, or $483 million. In \r\nless than 24 hours, 90 per cent of Dominica’s gross \r\ndomestic product was wiped out, and over 7,000 \r\npeople were severely affected. Most of the damage \r\nwas sustained in the transport, housing and agriculture \r\nsectors. \r\nOwing to the magnitude of the damage and the \r\nlimited resources of our country, we had to depend on \r\nsupport from outside Dominica to provide immediate \r\nrelief to those who were affected. The outpouring of \r\nsupport allowed us to bring emergency relief to all \r\npeople in a timely manner. On behalf of the people \r\nand Government of the Commonwealth of Dominica, \r\nand on my own behalf, I wish to extend our profound \r\ngratitude to all the countries, governmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations and Dominicans, at \r\nhome and abroad, for their tremendous support during \r\nour time of need.\r\nWe also thank those partners that have pledged \r\ntheir commitment to workingYay!! with us during the \r\nrebuilding of a stronger and more climate-resilient \r\nDominica. My Government and people will forever be \r\ngrateful to those who extended the hand of friendship to \r\nus. With the help of God, the international community \r\nand the resolve and resilience of the Government \r\nand people of the Commonwealth of Dominica, we \r\nwill build a stronger and more resilient Dominica. In \r\nbuilding a better and stronger Dominica, we will, of \r\nnecessity, have to factor into our constructions and \r\nsettlements measures that will provide resilience and \r\nadaptation to the impact of climate change.\r\nWe therefore expect that replacing and restoring \r\ndamaged infrastructure will be more expensive than \r\nit has been in the past. That extra cost undermines \r\nour progress inY achieving sustainable development, \r\nbecause of the constant need to re-allocate resources \r\nfrom nationally identified priority areas to address the \r\nchallenges — challenges brought about, to a large extent, \r\nby climate change. Those are factors that contribute to \r\nthe high debt burden of small island developing States \r\nsuch as Dominica.\r\nAt times like these, in order to respond effectively \r\nto the disaster, we urgently need the assistance of the \r\ninternational community, to make available, in a timely \r\nmanner, access to grants, concessionary financing and \r\ndevelopment assistance. That is of critical importance \r\nto ensure that the gains we have made in achieving \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals are not reversed \r\nand that we are able to meet the agreed Sustainable \r\n15-29946 11/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). Beyond the immediate \r\npresent, the Commonwealth of Dominica calls for an \r\ninternational natural-disaster-risk fund to provide \r\nfinancial resources to small island developing States \r\nthat have been impacted by natural disasters. In the case \r\nof the Caribbean States, that could be in collaboration \r\nwith or an extension to the catastrophic risk fund that \r\nexists in the Caribbean Development Bank. We propose \r\nthat that special natural-disaster-risk fund should be \r\ncapitalized by the annex I parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, other major \r\ngreenhouse-gas emitters and voluntary contributions \r\nby other countries.\r\nOver the past decade, the impact of climate \r\nchange has wreaked havoc on Caribbean SIDS. In \r\n2004, Hurricane Ivan, a category 3 system, wiped \r\nout twice the value of the gross domestic product of \r\nGrenada — approximately $1 billion — and left 18,000 \r\npeople without shelter, food and personal belongings. \r\nOn 24 December 2013, we were violently reminded \r\nof the impact of slow-moving weather systems on the \r\nlives of our Caribbean people. Dominica, Saint Lucia, \r\nand Saint Vincent and the Grenadines were set back by \r\n3.4 per cent, 1.4 per cent and 12.8 per cent of their gross \r\ndomestic products, respectively. \r\nWe in the Caribbean have been on the receiving \r\nend of the impact of climate change for decades. We \r\ntherefore know from our own experiences that the \r\nimpact of climate change represents a real and present \r\ndanger to the existence of small island States like \r\nDominica. We are living the effects of climate change. \r\nEven as recently as yesterday, our sister Caribbean \r\nisland country of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas \r\nwas impacted by Hurricane Joaquin. We stand in \r\nsolidarity with the Government and people of the \r\nBahamas, as they struggle to deal with the devastation \r\nthat it has caused.\r\nAs we move closer to the twenty-first session of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change (COP21) \r\nlater this year, we trust that all States parties are \r\nheeding the warnings of the scientific community \r\nand the plea of those of us who experience the impact \r\nof climate change on a daily basis, and that they are \r\npreparing to make serious commitments to reducing \r\nglobal warming. It will be crucial at COP21 to put in \r\nplace a system that makes possible the achievement of \r\nthe not-more-than 1.5°C goal, by agreeing to the highest \r\npossible levels of mitigation, ambition, finance and a \r\nvery rigorous system for transparency, complemented \r\nby a compliance regime.\r\nHowever, while such commitments are commendable \r\nand should reduce and hopefully reverse the trend of \r\nincreasing global mean temperature, the slow onset of \r\nevents of climate change will continue to have severe \r\nimpacts on developing countries. We therefore call for \r\nthe establishment at COP21 of a new loss and damage \r\nmechanism that will take into account the impact \r\nof climate change and provide resources for SIDS to \r\nrespond to those challenges.\r\nThe recently concluded Summit on the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda laid out a highly robust and \r\npeople-centred framework that we must all commit to \r\nimplementing for the sake of a better tomorrow for our \r\ncitizens and future generations. We must participate \r\nand play our individual and collective roles in ensuring \r\nthat all 17 of the Agenda’s Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and its 169 targets are not merely aspirational \r\nbut also achievable. We were gratified to see several of \r\nour priority issues reflected in the text, such as a need \r\nto build resilience and to conserve and sustainably use \r\noceans and seas; food security; water and sanitation; \r\naffordable, reliable and sustainable energy; crime; \r\nclimate change; and sustainable consumption and \r\nproduction, among others.\r\nIt is up to all of us, individually and collectively, to \r\nensure the realization of the SDGs. The Commonwealth \r\nof Dominica is therefore encouraged by the strides that \r\nsmall island developing States are making towards \r\nthe attainment of SDG 7, on affordable and clean \r\nenergy. Just a few days ago, on 27 September, SIDS \r\ndemonstrated their leadership, by creating the first-ever \r\nintergovernmental organization for SIDS, the Small \r\nIsland Developing States Sustainable Energy Initiative \r\n(SIDS DOCK). The statute came into force with a \r\nmembership of 32, creating a sustainable energy and \r\nclimate-resilient organization. SIDS DOCK is intended \r\nto provided a collective voice, financial leverage and \r\nimplementation mechanisms to transform our national \r\nenergy sectors into catalysts for sustainable low-carbon \r\neconomic development and help us meet the urgent \r\nneed to mitigate, adapt and build resilience to climate \r\nchange. The Government of the Commonwealth of \r\nDominica is proud to have had the opportunity to serve \r\nas the Chair of the steering committee responsible for \r\nthe establishment of this first-ever intergovernmental \r\norganization of SIDS.\r\n12/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nOn behalf of the States members of SIDS DOCK, we \r\nwish to express our gratitude to our partners, Denmark \r\nand Japan, which have made our initiative possible. We \r\nalso extend our thanks to the Government of Austria \r\nand the United Nations Development Programme \r\nfor being genuine partners in the spirit of the SIDS \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway \r\nand establishing the earliest centres for renewable \r\nenergy and energy efficiency in the Caribbean and \r\nPacific. We also thank the Government of Sweden for \r\nits support for the development of the project pipeline. \r\nWe look forward to their continued partnership in that \r\nand other initiatives aimed at achieving the SDGs.\r\nSIDS are equally concerned about sustainably \r\nutilizing and conserving local resources, such as our \r\noceans, seas and marine resources, for the benefit of \r\nall our people. SDG 14 creates an opportunity for SIDS \r\nto have more control over the vast marine area, which \r\nwhen combined is six times larger than the land mass of \r\nthe European Union. For small island States — or, more \r\nappropriately, large ocean States — we are the oceans. \r\nWe therefore endorse the We Are the Ocean initiative \r\nbeing developed and co-chaired by the Marshall Islands \r\nand Grenada, with the Commonwealth of Dominica \r\nplaying a major coordinating role. As a response to \r\nthat need, a few days ago, at the annual meeting of \r\nthe Clinton Global Initiative, SIDS DOCK, together \r\nwith partners, launched the Blue Guardians. We look \r\nforward to participating in that initiative.\r\nThe Commonwealth of Dominica is encouraged \r\nby the emphasis that the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\nhas placed on the mobilization of support for the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. A combination of financing \r\nmodalities and sources is essential to assist developing \r\ncountries meet their development goals by providing \r\naccess to essential public services, ending hunger, \r\nreducing poverty and enhancing the lives of all people. \r\nDominica is therefore committed to and supports the \r\ncall for us to incorporate sustainable development and \r\nthe pursuit of equity, including gender equality, women \r\nand girls’ empowerment, and social inclusion, in our \r\ndomestic policies. Those policies are consistent with \r\nthe goals my Government has been committed to and \r\nhas been promoting since the dawn of the century.\r\nOur efforts notwithstanding, middle-income SIDS \r\nlike Dominica are a special category that must be \r\nrecognized and dealt with in a manner that reflects \r\nour realities. The measure of per capita income \r\nas a qualifier for determining access to official \r\ndevelopment assistance and concessionary financing \r\ndistorts the true situation of SIDS and ignores our \r\nspecial vulnerabilities. The public debt stock is another \r\nessential indicator that must be factored in when the true \r\nstate of middle-income SIDS is considered. High debt \r\noverhang makes it difficult for SIDS to provide essential \r\npublic services. That is compounded by the fragility of \r\nour economies and the constant threat and impact of \r\nnatural disasters, which make us especially vulnerable. \r\nIn fact, according to a recent report by the United \r\nNations Economic Commission for Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean, it is estimated that the economic cost of \r\nnatural disasters in Caribbean countries over the 2000-\r\n2014 period exceeded $30.7 billion.\r\nFurthermore, I am advised that at least 40 per \r\ncent of the debt burden of Caribbean States is due to \r\ndebt incurred in responding to natural disasters. A \r\nsingle major natural disaster can set back one of our \r\nsmall islands for more than a decade by obliterating \r\nthe country’s gross domestic product overnight. The \r\nrecent cases of Grenada and Dominica illustrate that \r\npoint vividly. In order for financing for sustainable \r\ndevelopment to be effective, durable and genuine, \r\nthere must be partnerships based on mutual respect. \r\nDevelopment partners, especially intergovernmental \r\nagencies and financial institutions, must be more \r\nresponsive to the needs of SIDS. Interventions therefore \r\nmust reflect the aspirations of the people and be \r\ninformed by genuine participation and local ownership.\r\nThe traditional North-South relationship must be \r\nreset to embrace collaboration and cooperation rather \r\nthan prescription and dictation. The new approach \r\nshould be enhanced by South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation. We therefore encourage countries in the \r\nSouth that have the means to do so to support South-\r\nSouth and triangular cooperation, to build essential \r\npublic infrastructure, to provide financing and to \r\nparticipate in science and technology innovation and \r\ncapacity-building.\r\nThe People’s Republic of China, for example, \r\nhas emerged as a leader in South-South cooperation. \r\nThe South has been benefiting from China’s role in \r\neconomic and social development through bilateral \r\ncooperation. We commend the efforts by the People’s \r\nRepublic of China for its role in establishing the Asian \r\nInfrastructure Investment Bank, thereby creating a \r\nmultilateral platform for South-South cooperation as \r\nan extension to its excellent bilateral cooperation. Our \r\ncooperation with the People’s Republic of China has \r\n15-29946 13/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nbrought about major improvements in our country’s \r\ninfrastructure, education, health care, sports, national \r\nsecurity and agriculture. We thank China for its \r\ncontribution to the people of Dominica.\r\nSouth-South cooperation in some cases has \r\ncreated economic space for our countries to implement \r\ninfrastructure and social programmes for the benefit \r\nof our people. A case in point is the PetroCaribe \r\narrangement by the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, \r\nin which Latin American and Caribbean countries are \r\nprovided with a reliable supply of oil and oil products \r\nunder favourable terms and conditions. That spirit \r\nof solidarity is a shining example of South-South \r\ncooperation. The leadership of Venezuela has also led \r\nto the creation of the Bolivarian Alternative for the \r\nPeoples of Our America (ALBA). ALBA has funded \r\nand continues to fund development programmes in \r\nagriculture, infrastructure, education and health care \r\nin Dominica and its other member States, especially in \r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nSimilarly, the Republic of Cuba has been a leader \r\nin South-South and triangular cooperation. Cuba has \r\nprovided tremendous support to countries in the Latin \r\nAmerica and Caribbean region and as far away as Africa, \r\nthanks to its vast pool of human resources, especially in \r\nhealth care and education. At the same time, Cuba has \r\nprovided capacity-building and technology transfer in \r\nessential areas.\r\nWe applaud the actions taken by President Barack \r\nObama to normalize relations between Cuba and the \r\nUnited States. The removal of Cuba from the United \r\nStates list of countries that sponsor terrorism is an \r\nendorsement of the call that Dominica, the Caribbean \r\nCommunity and the majority of the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations have been making for almost two \r\ndecades. Those steps are undoubtedly steps in the right \r\ndirection, that is, towards the full integration of Cuba \r\ninto the international, economic, financial and trading \r\nsystems. We appeal to the legislative branch of the \r\nUnited States Government to allow President Obama to \r\ncomplete the process by lifting all sanctions on Cuba.\r\nAlmost 70 years ago, on 24 October 1945, the \r\nUnited Nations came into existence when 29 nations \r\nratified the Charter of the United Nations. The impact \r\nof two major wars in short succession had devastated the \r\nworld, leaving millions dead. The world vowed “never \r\nagain”. The world of today is far different than it was \r\n70 years ago. There are far more Member States and the \r\nbalance of power has shifted slightly, with the South \r\nplaying a greater role. Human development has been \r\nunprecedented, moving more people out of poverty, \r\nand yet so much more needs to be done. We have \r\nplaced our planet in peril from the existential threat of \r\nclimate change. The rise of terrorism and radicalization \r\nthroughout the world, especially in Iraq and Syria, is an \r\nattack on peace and security everywhere.\r\nWe therefore must resolve to enhance the role of \r\nthe United Nations in resolving matters that go beyond \r\nborders and affect all of humankind and our planet. That \r\nrequires changes to the working methods of the General \r\nAssembly and a more representative Security Council \r\nto reflect today’s realities. We must continue to call \r\nfor the protection of our planet. We must listen to and \r\nheed the cries of those who are suffering throughout the \r\nworld. We must create and adopt policies that address \r\nthe pressing needs of the most vulnerable among us. \r\nAbove all else, we must continue to work to resolve \r\nthe issues that threaten the peace and stability of our \r\nnations.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Dunya Maumoon, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Maldives.\r\nMs. Maumoon (Maldives): The first three words \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations reads “We the \r\npeoples”. Those words make it clear that human life is \r\nat the heart of the Charter of the United Nations. It must \r\nremain the key principle guiding our work.\r\nThis year, we mark the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the Charter, 70 years since the establishment \r\nof the United Nations. There is not a more opportune \r\ntime to ask ourselves, “Have we served ‘we the peoples’ \r\nwell?” The answer to that question is probably “yes”. \r\nI say that because succeeding generations have been \r\nsaved from the scourge of inter-State war. \r\nYet we remain unable to counter intra-State conflict. \r\nOur faith in fundamental human rights is reaffirmed in \r\nprinciple, yet the equal rights of men and women and of \r\nnations large and small are ignored. The rule of law and \r\nthe values of good governance are advocated for some \r\nbut ignored for others. We promised to promote social \r\nprogress and better standards of life, and, yes, extreme \r\npoverty has been reduced significantly; more children \r\nthan ever are going to school. Yet the gap between \r\nthe rich and the poor is widening, and ignorance and \r\nintolerance are rampant. The Charter failed to recognize \r\n14/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nthe environment as an issue of importance, and we fail \r\nthe environment every day.\r\nDespite all that, the United Nations is the best hope \r\nfor humankind. And it must remain relevant. If we want \r\nthe United Nations to become more resilient, face the \r\nemerging challenges of our time, give hope to the many \r\nwho perish in dire situations, inspire courage in the face \r\nof adversity and protect the rights of nations regardless \r\nof size, then the United Nations must be reformed.\r\nLast week, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which \r\nrecognizes at its core that development must be holistic, \r\nthat poverty is a multidimensional problem, and that \r\nwhat matters is the human being, whose rights must be \r\nprotected and promoted. Yet here in the United Nations \r\nwe remain trapped in silos, hiding away behind the \r\nexcuse of mandates. Why is it that the only issue the \r\nSecurity Council can discuss is guns and bombs, that \r\nthe Economic and Social Council cannot discuss war \r\nand peace, that development and war cannot have a \r\nhuman rights dimension, that specific issues have to be \r\nconfined to a specific body?\r\nWe believe that every problem can and should be \r\nlooked at from every angle. That is the only way of \r\nresponding to crises in a sustainable manner. In the real \r\nworld, neither real problems nor real solutions fit neatly \r\ninto separate compartments. A new way of approaching \r\nthe global challenges of our time is necessary, so let us \r\nstart organizing our work differently. \r\nOne important way of doing that is to redefine the \r\nconcept of security: to include all issues that threaten \r\nall of humankind, including climate change. For us in \r\nthe Maldives, climate change is a security threat. It \r\ndamages our economy, deprives us of our rights, our \r\nland and our way of life and threatens the very existence \r\nof our nation. When young children play by the beach, \r\nthe waves lapping at their feet, when a fisherman looks \r\nto the sea for the day’s catch and when we feel the cool \r\nbreeze of the ocean caressing us, it seems inconceivable \r\nthat those same waters may become our watery grave.\r\nThe Maldives is ready to act. We have always \r\nbeen the first in line. Together with other small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS), we have taken urgent action \r\nto keep the rise of global temperature below 1.5°C . We \r\nare reducing our emissions. We are working in good \r\nfaith towards a legally binding agreement in Paris this \r\nyear. If we, the smallest can act, why cannot the biggest?\r\nThe health of the oceans is another issue that \r\ndemands attention. The oceans are intimately linked \r\nwith our lives and livelihoods. Oceans and their wealth \r\nare the drivers of our economy, the source of our food \r\nand the backbone of our heritage and traditions. Unless \r\nwe sustain the wealth of the oceans, we can achieve \r\nnothing. That is why the Maldives banned turtle \r\npoaching in the early eighties, declared a biosphere \r\nreserve in 2012 and made its entire area a shark \r\nsanctuary. We understand the value of our oceans and \r\nall the treasures they contain. Our oceans are home \r\nto some of the most valuable marine habitats in the \r\nworld, yet the illicit exploitation of natural resources, \r\nmaritime piracy and other criminal activities threaten \r\nand undermine the peace and security of our countries.\r\nBuilding the resilience of our people must remain \r\nat the centre of all our efforts, abroad and at home. That \r\nis why President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom’s \r\nGovernment has embarked on a national development \r\nprogramme based on empowerment, especially of the \r\nyoung and of children and women. We believe that \r\ninvesting in people is the best way to promote human \r\nrights, to guarantee a brighter future for the generations \r\nto come and to ensure that the democratic gains we have \r\nmade are consolidated and further enhanced. \r\nThe Maldives is a nation that is governed by the rule \r\nof law. Our strong commitment to upholding the rule of \r\nlaw will continue, regardless of a person’s position in \r\nsociety and even in cases where it is most inconvenient \r\nto do so. I can assure Member States that we will not \r\nfail in that endeavour.\r\nThe United Nations rose from the ashes of war and \r\ndestruction at a time when swarms of refugees were \r\ncrossing borders and seas, leaving everything behind \r\nto seek safety and security and to save their own lives \r\nand their children’s. We have gone through those times \r\nand built a better, more integrated, more tolerant world. \r\nFear of the other did not overtake humankind. \r\nToday, as we see similar pictures of girls and \r\nboys, women and men seeking safety from war and \r\ncertain death, I urge everyone to show compassion. A \r\ngood start can be made by using the right term: it is a \r\nrefugee, not a migrant, crisis. The refugees are running \r\naway from senseless violence — barbarism that is being \r\ncarried out by terrorist groups in the name of Islam. \r\nThe Maldives condemns the acts of those groups, which \r\nare not only un-Islamic but also anti-Islamic. They are \r\nfuelling the rise of Islamophobia around the world. \r\n15-29946 15/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nThe international community must not let those groups \r\nredefine our beautiful religion of peace, tolerance and \r\ncompassion.\r\nWe thought that apartheid had been dismantled, yet \r\nIsrael pursues apartheid policies in occupied Palestine \r\nand the world remains indifferent. Three days ago, \r\nwe witnessed the raising of the Palestinian f lag here \r\nat the United Nations. That was indeed a historic step, \r\nbut if Palestine were to attain full membership in the \r\nUnited Nations that would be a much more significant \r\nstep. A permanent solution would involve the complete \r\nwithdrawal of Israel and the establishment of the State \r\nof Palestine, with East Jerusalem at its capital, within \r\nthe 1967 borders.\r\nThe small island developing States of the world are \r\ndifferent from the large States. We face different kinds \r\nof challenges that require very different responses. \r\nThat is a fact that everyone now recognizes. However, \r\nthe international architecture, including the United \r\nNations system, is not designed to accommodate the \r\nunique features of small States. That needs to change, \r\nand changes need to happen now. We, the small States, \r\ndo not want to be defined only by our vulnerabilities. \r\nWe are ready to be part of the solution. In Samoa last \r\nyear, the SIDS called for the building of partnerships as \r\nthe way forward. Alone we might be weak, but united \r\nwe can move mountains.\r\nWe in the Maldives have always believed that we \r\ncan do anything we set our mind to, as long as we \r\nremain sincere in our intention and unwavering in our \r\ncommitment. And the United Nations has never failed \r\nto inspire us in our resolve. That is why the Maldives \r\njoined the United Nations less than two months after \r\ngaining independence. Just a few days ago, we celebrated \r\n50 years of our membership. The United Nations has \r\nserved us well, and we are committed to expanding and \r\nfurther strengthening that valuable partnership. \r\nThough short of finances, we have no shortage \r\nof smart ideas. Our former President, Mr. Maumoon \r\nAbdul Gayoom, was the first to speak about the issue \r\nof sea-level rise from this rostrum. We were the first \r\nto introduce the concept of the security of small States \r\nto the United Nations and the first to start advocating \r\nhere in the Assembly for the link between human rights \r\nwith climate change. And we remain relentless in our \r\npursuit of those issues, not only because it is good for \r\nthe Maldives, but because it is also good for humankind.\r\nFifty years ago, when we applied for United Nations \r\nmembership, some doubted our ability to survive and \r\nquestioned our capacity to contribute. After 50 years of \r\nUnited Nations membership, I say to those sceptics that \r\nwe are not only willing, we are also able. We are not \r\nonly viable, we are also valuable. And as Maldivians, \r\nwe are proud of what we have achieved.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Niermala Badrising, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Suriname.\r\nMs. Badrising (Suriname): On behalf of President \r\nDesiré Delano Bouterse and the Government and \r\nthe people of the Republic of Suriname, I would \r\nlike to congratulate you, Sir, on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession, a landmark anniversary for our global body \r\nof nations. We pledge our full support to you in the \r\nsuccessful execution of your duties. We also wish to \r\ntake this opportunity to salute your predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his skilful leadership \r\nand commitment in helping to shape the new global \r\nagenda, and we wish him well in his future endeavours. \r\nAnd we would like to pay tribute to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his sterling efforts in guiding our \r\nOrganization through these challenging times for \r\ninternational peace, prosperity and security.\r\nAt its inception 70 years ago, the United \r\nNations made a commitment to saving succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, reaffirming faith \r\nin fundamental human rights, establishing global \r\njustice and promoting social progress. The ensuing \r\nseven decades have unquestionably brought many \r\nachievements. The United Nations, in collaboration \r\nwith its Member States, specialized organizations and \r\nother relevant stakeholders, including civil society, has \r\npromoted and assured access to education for boys and \r\ngirls around the world, brought humanitarian relief to \r\nthose in need, assisted societies in restoring democracy \r\nand supported defenders of human rights. It has given \r\na voice to marginalized groups, especially the elderly, \r\nwomen, young people, indigenous peoples and persons \r\nwith disabilities, and played a crucial role in the fight \r\nagainst racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance.\r\nHowever, despite such advances, there still \r\nremain challenges such as armed conflicts, the rise \r\nof fundamentalism, disregard for fundamental human \r\nrights and freedoms and global health concerns such as \r\n16/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nHIV/AIDS and non-communicable diseases, as well as \r\nthe devastating effects of climate change and natural \r\ndisasters. My Government therefore applauds the timely \r\nand inspiring themes chosen for this general debate and \r\nfor the session as a whole: “The United Nations at 70: \r\na new commitment to action” and “The United Nations \r\nat 70: the road ahead for peace, security and human \r\nrights”. Given that context, it was only fitting that we \r\nshould adopt our new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). In that spirit, therefore, \r\nwe, the global community, must recommit to the ideals \r\nof peace and security, human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nCombating climate change is high on my \r\nGovernment’s national agenda. Last Wednesday, my \r\nPresident reiterated its importance for our country’s \r\ndevelopment and future in his address to Parliament on \r\nthe occasion of the presentation of our annual budget \r\nand our Government policy statement for the period \r\n2015-2020. \r\nAlthough Suriname is South America’s smallest \r\ncountry, we are home to about 8 per cent of the world’s \r\nuntouched tropical forest. With around 94 per cent \r\nof the country covered by rainforest, we can proudly \r\ninform the Assembly that we are the greenest nation on \r\nEarth. Approximately 12 per cent of our total acreage, \r\nincluding the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, a \r\nUNESCO World Heritage Site, has been designated a \r\nnatural protected area. Our rivers carry between 10 and \r\n15 per cent of the world’s supply of fresh water. We can \r\nbe seen as almost unique, since we are one of the few \r\ncarbon-negative countries in the world.\r\nDespite such wondrous natural blessings, my \r\ncountry continues to see the first effects of climate \r\nchange. Suriname has 239 miles of low-lying coastline \r\nand is listed as one of the seven countries in the world \r\nmost vulnerable to the effects of the rising sea level. My \r\nGovernment looks forward to the establishment of a new \r\nglobal agreement on climate change in Paris later this \r\nyear. It should include specific actions aimed at meeting \r\nmitigation and adaptation commitments. It will be \r\nnecessary to make the provision of financial resources \r\na priority, especially for small island developing \r\nStates and countries with low-lying coasts, if we are \r\nto implement the necessary measures effectively. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome the further implementation of \r\nthe Green Climate Fund, including the ongoing efforts \r\nto create a logical framework model for financing for \r\nReducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest \r\nDegradation in Developing Countries, or REDD-plus. \r\nIn the context of its intended nationally determined \r\ncontribution, the Republic of Suriname will submit \r\na new climate action plan to the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change.\r\nThe Americas are committed to peace and security \r\nas a precursor of sustainable development. The \r\nproclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean as a \r\nzone of peace is testimony to our use of a multifaceted \r\napproach to assure the long-term development of our \r\ncontinent and peoples. My Government underscores \r\nthe critical importance of the processes of dialogue \r\nand diplomacy as essential contributing elements \r\nto democracy, peace, stability and security. My \r\nGovernment therefore supports the peaceful and \r\nnegotiated settlement of various types of dispute, \r\nincluding border disagreements.\r\nMy Government welcomes the positive steps taken \r\ntowards normalizing bilateral relations between the \r\nRepublic of Cuba and the United States of America. \r\nSuriname has a longstanding friendship with the people \r\nof Cuba, and we are of the view that the ongoing process \r\nof strengthening relations will help to enhance peace, \r\nstability, unity and development in the Americas. We \r\nagree with the international community that lifting the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba \r\nshould be a top priority.\r\nDecades ago, the United Nations adopted the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, a cornerstone \r\ndocument that has inspired the adoption of various \r\nstandard-setting human rights instruments at the \r\ninternational and regional levels. \r\nMy Government is concerned about the loss of \r\nlife and destruction resulting from current violence \r\nand ongoing armed conflict. We are also concerned \r\nabout the current humanitarian crisis caused by the \r\nhuge numbers of refugees f leeing the Middle East and \r\nAfrica.\r\nIssues related to gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women, particularly that of increasing \r\nwomen’s political participation at all levels, continue to \r\nbe of particular interest to the international community. \r\nMy Government applauds the commitments made \r\nin that regard by the Heads of State and Government \r\nat last week’s global leaders’ meeting here in New \r\nYork. It is vital that we undertake the necessary \r\nmeasures to prevent all forms of discrimination at all \r\n15-29946 17/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nlevels, including establishing relevant legislative and \r\nadministrative frameworks.\r\nDespite the many positive developments with \r\nrespect to shaping the international agenda over the \r\npast seven decades, the socioeconomic development of \r\nand existing social inequality in a number of regions \r\nstill remain alarming. My Government is of the view \r\nthat human-centred economic development policies are \r\ninstrumental in guaranteeing the realization of social \r\ndevelopmental goals for the benefit of our peoples and \r\ncountries. My Government emphasizes that there is an \r\nurgent need for an international enabling environment, \r\nincluding access to financing for development, in order \r\nto alleviate all forms of poverty and to create economic \r\nopportunities that enable all peoples and countries to \r\nprosper.\r\nIndeed, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\ncan fulfil a critical role in gradually advancing \r\nsustainable development and equality. At the national \r\nlevel, my Government adopted the integrated Strategy \r\nfor Sustainable Development, which emphasizes the \r\ncentrality of the human being in our developmental \r\nefforts.\r\nThe United Nations at 70 is at a critical stage to \r\nbecome a more efficient and effective global institution, \r\nadequately resourced and fit for the challenges ahead. \r\nWe the peoples of the world have to carry forward the \r\nrenewed hopes and aspirations of the Organization. \r\nSuriname stands ready to play its part in strengthening \r\nmultilateralism in partnership with other States and \r\ncivil society to protect and preserve the planet and to \r\nensure that everyone has a fair chance to develop his or \r\nher fullest potential for a better life.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Daniel Jean, Deputy Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Canada.\r\nMr. Jean (Canada): I am honoured to appear before \r\nthe Assembly today to deliver these remarks on behalf \r\nof the Government of Canada in this, the seventieth \r\nanniversary year of the United Nations.\r\nAs a founding Member of the United Nations, \r\nCanada played a constructive role in drafting the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and creating the \r\nOrganization before, during and after the 1945 San \r\nFrancisco Conference. There can be little doubt that \r\nover the past seven decades, through the General \r\nAssembly, other United Nations bodies and the myriad \r\nof agencies, funds and programmes associated with \r\nthe United Nations, the Organization has often helped \r\nto improve the lives and prospects of people around \r\nthe world. It has done so even as Member States and \r\nthe United Nations itself have struggled to realize the \r\nOrganization’s most fundamental aspirations. Since \r\nthat time, Canada and Canadians have been steadfast \r\nsupporters of the United Nations and deeply engaged in \r\nits work to deliver results for the benefit of our common \r\nfuture.\r\nOne of the ways in which the United Nations led \r\nthe way in its early years, and in which it continues \r\nto light the path ahead, has been in the vital area of \r\ninternational development. Canada is proud to support, \r\nin word and deed, the commitments in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). \r\nThe Organization and the international community it \r\nrepresents deserve our praise for aiming to eliminate \r\npoverty on a global scale. It is an objective that \r\nwill require innovative new approaches and new \r\npartnerships. We will also need to promote fundamental \r\nfreedoms, the rule of law and accountable governance \r\nin those parts of the world where the critical building \r\nblocks for sustainable development are weak or absent.\r\nCanada looks forward to collaborating with others \r\nto sustain the momentum already underway as a result \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals and to move \r\nforward with renewed determination. The Government \r\nof Canada has identified maternal, newborn and child \r\nhealth as a priority for development, in support for which \r\nwe have committed $3.5 billion over the next five years. \r\nThere has been progress, to be sure, but there remains \r\nmuch to do. Canada welcomes the inclusion of maternal, \r\nnewborn and child health in the 2030 Agenda as a means \r\nto follow through on the commitments made under the \r\n2010 Group of Eight Muskoka Initiative, adopted at the \r\nSaving Every Woman, Every Child Summit, held in \r\nToronto in 2014, and the renewed Global Strategy for \r\nWomen’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health.\r\nAs the international community commits to \r\nimplementing the 2030 Agenda, one of the most critical \r\nquestions we still face is how to finance the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. While current official development \r\nassistance will retain its important role, current and \r\nprojected levels fall well short of the trillions of dollars \r\nrequired to implement the Goals. We need to find new \r\nways to blend financing from donors, foundations, the \r\nprivate sector and other sources to fill the gap. \r\n18/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nThe Global Financing Facility (GFF) in support \r\nof Every Woman, Every Child is an excellent model \r\nof how the private sector can be brought on board to \r\ncollaborate with national Governments to sustainably \r\nfinance maternal, newborn and child health initiatives. \r\nThe additional investment generated through the GFF \r\nand other innovative financing mechanisms will set the \r\ncourse for increasing funding from the current billions \r\nof dollars allocated for development finance to the \r\ntrillions required if we want to achieve the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. Canada will continue to play a \r\nleading role in helping to establish those mechanisms to \r\nsecure sustainable financing and leverage the expertise \r\nand resources of the private sector in support of the \r\ndevelopment outcomes.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nHumanitarian assistance is even more important, \r\nas progress in development can be wiped out overnight \r\nby natural disasters, political violence and international \r\nconflicts or crises linked to acute food insecurity or \r\nthe spread of disease. When considering the first-ever \r\nWorld Humanitarian Summit, to be held in May 2016, \r\nwe all must strive to increase countries’ determination \r\nto respect international humanitarian law, to protect \r\ncivilians and to strengthen resilience when faced with \r\npossible crises, in particular by ensuring that national \r\nGovernments will be equipped to deal with those crises.\r\nIn responding to the needs of humankind, Canada \r\nalways strives to act with generosity, speed and \r\nefficacy to save lives, to alleviate suffering and to \r\npreserve the dignity of the people most affected. In \r\n2014, Canada increased by 32 per cent its financial \r\ncontribution to humanitarian assistance in response to \r\nthe ever-increasing needs in the world, especially for \r\ncountries in crisis, such as Iraq, Syria, the Philippines, \r\nUkraine, the Central African Republic, South Sudan \r\nand Yemen. Similarly, Canada has played a leading role \r\nin the prompt and effective action by the international \r\ncommunity to the Ebola epidemic in certain regions of \r\nWest Africa.\r\nAs shown at numerous times in the past, Canada \r\nhas the capacity and the will to assist and deal with \r\nthe crisis of refugees and migrants currently affecting \r\nEurope. Since the establishment of the United Nations, \r\nthe international community has been confronted with \r\nmany situations brought about by the voluntary and \r\ninvoluntary displacement of people. In some cases, \r\nsuch as those of individuals trying to escape the crisis \r\nin Syria, the issue is urgent. In others, it is part of a \r\nlong-term phenomenon. We work in collaboration with \r\nour partners to address those difficulties, including by \r\naccelerating the resettlement process of Syrians and \r\nIraqis in our own country this year.\r\nWe know that Canadians will support those efforts \r\nwith the same spirit of generosity that has characterized \r\nthe assistance they have provided when others were in \r\ndistress and affected by disasters. However, we cannot \r\nstop there; we must also take on together human rights \r\nviolations and promote stability, peace and prosperity \r\nin regions subjected to instability or violent conflicts. \r\nThe United Nations, rooted in respect for fundamental \r\nrights and freedoms, democracy and the rule of law, \r\nwas established specifically for that purpose. \r\nWithout the strong and collective commitment of \r\nall Member States to those principles, the edifying \r\nwords of the Preamble to the Charter risk becoming \r\nsimply hollow and meaningless words. In the words of \r\nthe Prime Minister of Canada:\r\n“Where human misery abounds, where grinding \r\npoverty is the rule, where justice is systematically \r\ndenied, there is no real peace — only the seeds of \r\nfuture conflict.” (A/69/PV.11, p. 11)\r\nCanada continues to support a wide range of initiatives \r\nand measures established by the United Nations to \r\npromote peace and security, including the most recent \r\nefforts to combat terrorism and to identify new ways to \r\ncombat violent extremism.\r\nInnocent civilians suffer the most in internal and \r\ninternational conflicts, as we see today in Iraq and \r\nSyria, where the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS) and other terrorist groups are sowing destruction. \r\nWe are concerned by the resurgence of the Taliban in \r\nnorthern Afghanistan, by the scale of the ambition \r\nshown by Daesh and their expanding networks in South \r\nAsia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Sahel, \r\nas well as by their subsidiaries, such as Boko Haram. \r\nThe international community must continue to take \r\nsignificant steps to combat terrorism together. \r\nFaced with that situation, Canada’s action includes \r\nnot only its role in the military coalition that is fighting \r\nagainst the immediate threat posed by Daesh, but also \r\nefforts to provide humanitarian assistance. Canada \r\nwill continue to support ethnic and religious minorities \r\nwhose very existence is threatened.\r\n15-29946 19/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nWe are committed to drawing everyone’s attention \r\nto the consequences of sexual violence and other \r\nbarbaric abuses perpetrated by ISIS against women and \r\ngirls. Last July, we hosted the Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in \r\nConflict, Ms. Zainab Bangura, who presented graphic \r\nand detailed conclusions of her assessment mission to \r\nthe Middle East to members of the Global Coalition to \r\nCounter ISIL, gathered in Quebec City. At that meeting, \r\nCanada announced an additional financial contribution \r\nfor the survivors of abuses committed by Daesh and \r\nin support of the essential work being carried out by \r\nMs. Bangura.\r\nCanada has long been determined to work for the \r\nindependence of women and girls and for greater respect \r\nfor their rights in conflict situations. That is why we \r\nsupport a high-level review of the implementation of \r\nthe programme on women and peace and security, as \r\nwe have done for the past 15 years, that is, since the \r\nadoption of Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), \r\nthe first resolution on that issue. Canada has played \r\na leading role in the global campaign to eliminate \r\nchild marriage, early marriage and forced marriage, \r\na widespread and harmful practice that threatens the \r\nlives and the future of girls around the world, with \r\ndevastating consequences not only for them but also for \r\ntheir communities.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOur rules-based international system must be \r\npreserved. International guarantees lose their meaning \r\nif rules are f lagrantly violated. We must face acute \r\nchallenges to security and human rights, such as in \r\nIraq and Syria, as well as the abuses that follow in \r\nthe wake of acts of aggression, such as the Russian \r\ninvasion of Ukraine, the illegal annexation of Crimea \r\nand the continued interference in eastern Ukraine. This \r\nrostrum must not be used by leaders to subvert the \r\nprinciples on which this Organization was established. \r\nThis platform should be used to respond to, and tackle, \r\nthese global threats.\r\nTwo countries that persistently violate international \r\nstandards in this area and whose Governments oppress \r\ntheir own people and threaten their neighbours, \r\nas well as global peace are Iran and North Korea. \r\nNon-compliance over the course of decades raises \r\nquestions about ambitions and intentions. Verbal \r\npledges or paper promises are not enough. There must \r\nbe verifiable evidence of compliance and meaningful \r\npenalties for continued defiance. \r\nIn that regard, while we appreciate the efforts of \r\nthe P5+1, the real test of the Joint Comprehensive Plan \r\nof Action concerning Iran, or any similar agreement, \r\nwill be in its concrete implementation and independent \r\nverification. Actions speak louder than words. To \r\nthat end, it is vital to support, sustain and, where \r\nnecessary, enhance the monitoring capabilities of the \r\nrelevant agencies, such as the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency, and ensure that verifiable deeds match \r\nconciliatory words. Nothing less than the credibility of \r\nthe United Nations is at stake on such matters.\r\nAs with any organization, it is vital for the United \r\nNations to reassess what it does and how it pursues its \r\ngoals in the light of the remarkable changes since its \r\nfounding. Canada wholeheartedly supports the high-\r\nlevel review of peace operations. We cannot always rely \r\non the instruments of the past to deal with the crises of \r\ntoday.\r\nFreedom, peace and stability pave the way to \r\nlasting prosperity. As we all know, the path to real \r\nsustainable development requires action at many levels \r\nand with many partners. Private-sector-led growth is a \r\nkey ingredient for achieving that goal and for reducing \r\npoverty. Trade and investment are at the heart of that \r\neffort. That is why Canada is a firm supporter of a free \r\nand open trading system that fosters growth, contributes \r\nto development and supports poverty reduction in all \r\nregions of the world.\r\nPerhaps no issue reminds us that we are all part of \r\none world more than the threat to our collective well-\r\nbeing posed by climate change, a global challenge that \r\nrequires global solutions. Canada takes the challenge of \r\nclimate change seriously and is working with all parties \r\nunder the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change to reach an effective post-2020 climate \r\nchange agreement at the twenty-first session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the Framework Convention, \r\nto be held later this year in Paris. For Canada, an \r\neffective agreement must address both mitigation and \r\nadaptation, and, most importantly, such an agreement \r\nmust include a commitment to mitigation actions by all \r\nof the world’s major emitters of greenhouse gases. \r\nOn 15 May, Canada announced its post-2020 \r\nclimate change target — an economy-wide reduction of \r\ngreenhouse gas emissions by 30 per cent below 2005 \r\nlevels by 2030. That is an ambitious target that is in line \r\n20/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nwith other major industrialized countries and reflects \r\nour national circumstances, including Canada’s position \r\nas a world leader in clean electricity generation.\r\nCanada recognizes that financing is a key part of \r\nthe discussion and, moving forward with our partners, \r\nwe will, as we have done in the past, continue to support \r\ninternational climate-change financing. Canada has \r\nalready pledged $300 million to the Green Climate \r\nFund, in addition to a previous investment of $1.2 billion \r\nthat we provided under quick-start climate-change \r\nfinancing, which has supported a number of beneficial \r\nprojects in more than 70 developing countries.\r\nMr. Alyemany (Yemen), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nFrom the beginning, Canada has been one of the \r\nlargest and most reliable financial contributors to the \r\nUnited Nations. In the light of that support, it should \r\ncome as no surprise that the Government of Canada and \r\nCanadians expect that money to be spent wisely and \r\nthat the United Nations should be held accountable for \r\nits expenditures.\r\nAs I said at the outset, the overarching aims of the \r\nUnited Nations since its creation have been remarkably \r\nconsistent, namely, to help achieve greater prosperity \r\nand security, to advance mutual respect, fairness and \r\ngood international conduct, and, ultimately, to inspire \r\nand sustain the hopes of people everywhere for a better \r\nfuture. With our friends and partners in the global \r\ncommunity, we have striven to make this world a \r\nbetter place and to make the United Nations a better \r\ninstrument for achieving those goals. We look forward \r\nto working together with other nations, as we have done \r\nfor seven decades, in pursuit of that common purpose.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ngive the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Daniele Bodini, \r\nChair of the Delegation of the Republic of San Marino.\r\nMr. Bodini (San Marino): I would like to \r\ncongratulate the President on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session. I \r\nalso wish to commend the work of His Excellency \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa, President of the General Assembly at \r\nthe sixty-ninth session, and to express sincere thanks to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts \r\nin leading the United Nations. The result of such efforts \r\nculminated in the very successful United Nations \r\nSummit for the adoption of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda and this general debate, as well as the historic \r\nvisit of the Holy Father, Pope Francis, to the General \r\nAssembly (see A/70/PV.3). Moreover, San Marino \r\nappreciates the constant and impartial attention that the \r\nSecretary-General has paid to all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAfter 70 years, the United Nations has not only \r\npassed the test of time, but it continues to represent a \r\nshining beacon of hope for all our countries. I believe \r\nthat in future we will have to be even more willing and \r\ninspired to strengthen and improve the role that this \r\ngreat institution plays. In fact, the first and last line of \r\ndefence for San Marino, a small State without an army \r\nand with limited territory and resources, is the United \r\nNations.\r\nEven the strongest and largest countries cannot \r\ndeal with the complexity and the multitude of today \r\nproblems all by themselves. They need the United \r\nNations too. With the help of the United Nations \r\nsystem, we, the Member States, have over the years \r\nbuilt the foundations for peace by preventing and \r\nending numerous disputes. We have been able to free \r\nmillions of people from extreme poverty and have made \r\nimportant progress in advancing human rights and \r\ndemocracy and in promoting justice and international \r\nlaw.\r\nUnfortunately, despite all our efforts and successes, \r\nthe international community continues to face the same \r\nchallenges: wars, poverty, inequality, discrimination \r\nand violence against women and children. In addition, \r\ntoday we face new global challenges, such as climate \r\nchange, economic and financial crises, unrelenting \r\nunemployment, international migration and terrorism. \r\nThose new threats are interdependent, and we should \r\nwork together with the United Nations to take them on \r\nand defeat them.\r\nAround the world, our people look to the United \r\nNations for leadership. That is why reform of the United \r\nNations is fundamental and must remain at the core of \r\nour collective efforts during the seventieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. We must make the Organization \r\nmore effective, while preserving its integrity and \r\nenhancing its status.\r\nEvery day, we witness the tragic migration from \r\nAfrica and Asia towards Europe. Those desperate people \r\nhave left their countries and their families behind, \r\nf leeing from conflicts, violence and persecution. \r\nThousands of them have died in the Mediterranean \r\nSea. We are pleased that, a few days ago, the high-\r\n15-29946 21/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nlevel side event here at Headquarters on strengthening \r\ncooperation on migration and refugee movements in \r\nthe perspective of the new development agenda was \r\norganized.\r\nSan Marino cannot remain silent about what is \r\nhappening in Iraq and Syria, where an ongoing inhuman \r\nethnic and religious cleansing is being carried out with \r\nunprecedented ferocity. We hope that under the able \r\nstewardship of Mr. Staffan de Mistura, a diplomatic \r\nsolution will be found in the near future.\r\nSan Marino believes that one of the most important \r\ntasks for us to deal with is the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons, thousands of which are ready to be \r\nemployed at any time. We cannot afford to wait any \r\nlonger.\r\nSan Marino strongly believes in further revitalizing \r\nand empowering the General Assembly, the forum \r\nwhere solutions to today’s challenges can be found and \r\nwhere consensus on issues of common interest must be \r\nreached. We commend the Security Council for all the \r\ndelicate and challenging work that it has accomplished \r\nover the years in favour of peace and security. \r\nNevertheless, it is time for a reform. We believe that \r\nSecurity Council reform should include an enlargement \r\nof the category of non-permanent members and a more \r\nbalanced geographical distribution. We are convinced \r\nthat, for that reform to be legitimate, it must be achieved \r\nwith the widest possible consensus.\r\nWe welcome the new post-2015 development \r\nagenda adopted a few days ago as the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1). It represents \r\na unique opportunity to prepare a brighter future for \r\nour citizens. The Goals at the core of the new Agenda \r\nare ambitious; they will guide our efforts in pursuit \r\nof poverty eradication, the empowerment of people, \r\nthe safeguarding of human dignity, shared prosperity, \r\ndecent jobs for all, and the protection of our planet. It is \r\nimportant that each country, after adopting its national \r\nagenda, assume responsibility for its own citizens and for \r\nthe international community in working to implement \r\nthe new Agenda. San Marino welcomes the fact that the \r\nhigh-level political forum on sustainable development \r\nand the Economic and Social Council will be assessing \r\nthe progress of that implementation. However, it is \r\ncritical that a comprehensive and effective mechanism \r\nfor review and accountability be established.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino has always paid \r\nspecial attention to the most vulnerable groups, such as \r\nwomen, children, the elderly and the disabled. Today, \r\nwomen are still the victims of discrimination and \r\nviolence in many parts of the world, including in the \r\nmost developed countries. Trafficking in women is an \r\nissue that is far from having been solved. Women living \r\nin conflict and post-conflict situations are often subject \r\nto sexual violence, torture and summary execution. \r\nChildren, the most vulnerable group, are also subject \r\nto violence, abuse and exploitation. A large number \r\nof children all over the world do not yet have access \r\nto basic services, health care and education. We have \r\nthe duty to protect and help our children. Moreover, \r\nthe international community must strive for the full \r\ninclusion and participation of the elderly and people \r\nwith disabilities in the economic, social and cultural \r\nlife of our communities.\r\nFreedom and peace have always represented the \r\ncore values of the Republic of San Marino over its \r\ncenturies-old history. San Marino is a small country, \r\nbut one strongly committed to the implementation \r\nof the universal values of the United Nations and the \r\nprinciples enshrined in its Charter. We are honoured to \r\noffer our contribution to the United Nations community.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Carlos Raúl Morales \r\nMoscoso, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Guatemala.\r\nMr. Morales Moscoso (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I come before this highest forum of the \r\nUnited Nations as the representative of the Government \r\nof Guatemala and of the President of the Republic, \r\nAlejandro Maldonado Aguirre. I greet Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session. With his vast experience and well-\r\nknown skill he can lead ably.\r\nI want to begin my statement by expressing the \r\ngrief and sorrow of the people and the Government of \r\nGuatemala after the tragedy that occurred last Thursday \r\nnight, 1 October, when a landslide buried at least 125 \r\nhomes, and in two hours killed 33 people and caused \r\nthe disappearance of approximately 600 other citizens, \r\nas well as a considerable number of injured, in a town \r\nnear Guatemala City. The landslide occurred as the \r\nresult of the heavy rains that have plagued Guatemala \r\nafter nearly 12 weeks of extreme drought, which caused \r\nserious damage to the country’s agricultural sector. Our \r\nrescue teams are now searching for survivors. More \r\nthan 616 rescuers are participating, and the citizenry \r\n22/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nis providing invaluable and exemplary support. We are \r\ngrateful for the international solidarity that the world \r\nhas shown following that tragedy.\r\nDuring the United Nations Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Summit, the Vice-President of Guatemala \r\ndescribed the momentous events that have taken place \r\nin our country over the past several months, which \r\nrepresent a watershed in our political history (see A/70/\r\nPV.6). He described how, beginning in April, the people \r\nof Guatemala took to the streets in huge numbers to \r\ndemonstrate their complete rejection of corruption and \r\ntheir indignation at the collapse of an economic, social \r\nand political system that was incapable of overcoming \r\npoverty and segregation of all kinds that revealed grave \r\nf laws in our system of governance. \r\nIt is important to stress the pluralistic, mass nature \r\nof the civic movement and especially its peaceful \r\ncharacter. There was not a single incident of violence \r\nduring four months of protest. In fact, the protests lasted \r\n22 weeks, during which the collective civic behaviour \r\nwas exemplary, without incidents of any sort, without \r\nvandalism and without a single act of aggression of any \r\nkind.\r\nThat great popular movement led to the resignation \r\nand trial of the Vice-President and, subsequently, the \r\nPresident of the Republic, along with other Government \r\nofficials and individuals. In that regard, it is important \r\nto stress the role that the United Nations played through \r\nthe International Commission against Impunity in \r\nGuatemala — known as CICIG —in support of the \r\nPublic Prosecutor’s Office. As a result of the foregoing, \r\nand with our Political Constitution as its framework, \r\na process was developed that culminated in the \r\nappointment of President Alejandro Maldonado Aguirre \r\non 3 September and the election of Vice-President Juan \r\nAlfonso Fuentes Soria on 16 September. They now have \r\nthe responsibility of leading the country towards the \r\ntransfer of presidential power on 14 January 2016.\r\nI would like to underscore that despite the \r\nserious challenges that arose, our laws and legally \r\nconstituted institutions responded. The constitutional \r\norder remained intact and no laws were violated. The \r\nconstitutional mechanisms, the system of justice, the \r\nelectoral system and the social media all functioned, \r\nand in general terms, our participatory democracy \r\nproved its strength.\r\nAll of these factors affected the results of the \r\ngeneral elections held on 6 September and had an \r\nimpact on voter turnout, which was the highest it \r\nhas been since the return to democracy 30 years ago. \r\nThose important gains belong to all Guatemalans, who \r\nare demanding deep and immediate changes. Their \r\nexpectations are high, and they hope to see concrete \r\nresults benefiting citizens in a short time, both from the \r\ncurrent transitional Government and from the one that \r\nwill be elected in the second round of voting, which we \r\nwill hold on 25 October.\r\nThe various sectors of Guatemalan society are \r\ndemanding the urgent reform of certain laws, including \r\nthose governing the civil service, the electoral process \r\nand political parties, legal education and State contracts. \r\nBut perhaps the most important aspect is the social \r\nimpact of the collective realization that Guatemala \r\nneeds to aim for a future built on a genuine, solid rule \r\nof law. As we stated when we took the f loor during \r\nthe Summit to adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1):\r\n“The invisible Guatemala, made up of \r\nindigenous peoples and peasants who have been \r\nmarginalized by the system, has not been satisfied \r\nwith the resigned approach taken by their leaders; it \r\nhas f looded the streets to warn that the amendment \r\nof a few laws is not enough. They demand reforms \r\nof the State for a profound transformation of the \r\neconomic, social and political system that would \r\nallow them to overcome poverty, exclusion and \r\nracism, thereby developing a true concept of \r\nnational and international solidarity, an essential \r\nelement of peace and security.” (A/70/PV.6, p. 4)\r\nIt is therefore important for the Guatemalan State \r\nto respond appropriately to the population’s demands to \r\nbe able to consolidate our democracy on the foundation \r\ncreated by that extraordinary movement and to achieve \r\na more peaceful, less exclusionary and more equitable \r\nsociety.\r\nAnother of the main challenges facing the State of \r\nGuatemala is to create better living conditions for its \r\ncitizens in order to avoid the exodus of so many who \r\nmust seek better horizons abroad. Migration should be \r\nan option, not aan obligation. Approximately 2 million \r\nGuatemalans currently live outside the country, most \r\nof them in the United States of America. That is a \r\nlong-standing phenomenon, but now one of the biggest \r\nconcerns is the growing migration of boys and girls \r\nwho travel by themselves, primarily with the goal of \r\nfamily reunification. Our countries should do their \r\n15-29946 23/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nbest to see that such children remain at home instead of \r\nrisking their lives.\r\nGuatemala, Honduras and El Salvador make up \r\nCentral America’s Northern Triangle. With the support \r\nof the Inter-American Development Bank and the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America, we have \r\nbeen developing the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity, \r\nwhose goal is to deal with the deepest roots of migration \r\nand to serve as a framework that offers new and better \r\neconomic prospects; build the conditions for better civil \r\nsecurity; create a social safety network for the most \r\nvulnerable groups of our societies; and strengthen our \r\ndemocratic institutions. In our draft budgets for 2016, \r\nthe three countries have planned for approximately \r\n$2.8 million to implement the Plan. \r\nThere is shared responsibilty among the countries \r\nof origin, transit and destination. Comprehensive \r\nimmigration reform in the United States of America is \r\ninevitable. It is a matter of principles and respect for \r\nhuman rights. We appreciate the efforts of President \r\nBarack Obama, and I take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nmy Government’s call for the approval of Temporary \r\nProtected Status, known as TPS, for Guatemalan \r\nimmigrants. The State of Guatemala, for its part, needs \r\nto broaden its consular network as soon as possible, \r\nespecially in the countries of North America, in order \r\nto offer protection and consular services to its citizens.\r\nOne of the main causes of migration is natural \r\ndisasters. This year again, the long drought and the delay \r\nin rains in the first harvest have impacted food security \r\nin the most vulnerable homes. More than 120,000 \r\nfamilies are currently affected, reprepresenting more \r\nthan 600,000 people who lack food for subsistence. We \r\nare grateful for the cooperation that we have received \r\nand call for more, basically because on top of chronic \r\npoverty come natural disastres, and now the effects of \r\nthe man-made crisis, which the citizens have rejected. \r\nNevertheless, our great strength is without a doubt the \r\ndesire for civic participation, which the transitional \r\nGovernment must support and respond to effectively \r\nwith an extreme shortage of resources.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to reiterate the \r\nState’s commitment to the communities affected by the \r\ndevelopment of the Chixoy Hydroelectric Dam. We are \r\ncommitted to making reparations to the affected groups \r\nand expect to begin making the first payments in the \r\ncoming weeks as part of a process that we hope to bring \r\nto a successful conclusion.\r\nI would like now to mention a few subjects relating \r\nto our foreign policy. First, I am pleased to report that \r\nwe have continued to make progress in our bilateral \r\nrelations with our neighbouring countries. \r\nWith respect to Belize, we have committed to \r\nappearing before the International Court of Justice to \r\nseek definitive resolution of our territorial, island and \r\nmarine dispute, as both countries have agreed. We \r\nlook forward to the entry into force of the 13 bilateral \r\nagreements signed in December 2014 and the protocol \r\nto the special agreement of 2008, signed in May.\r\nWith Mexico we maintain a robust, significant \r\nagenda and an unprecedented dynamic of cooperation. \r\nRecently 12 agreements were signed on economic \r\nissues, trade, border modernization and energy, in \r\naddition to addressing jointly challenges such as \r\nmigration and organized crime. \r\nWith Honduras, we have made progress on a \r\ncustoms union, a commitment  that has been pending \r\nfor many years in the Central American integration \r\nprocess. It will be the first customs union of the \r\nAmerican hemisphere.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nMoreover, Guatemala welcomes the restoration \r\nof diplomatic relations between the United States and \r\nCuba as an important step towards the strengthening of \r\nhemispheric cooperation. In that connection, we trust \r\nthat the embargo imposed on Cuba for over 50 years \r\nwill end.\r\nWe also applaud the reconciliation and the \r\ngrowing climate of cooperation generated among the \r\nparties separated by the Taiwan Strait. We hope that \r\nthat atmosphere of cooperation can be extended to the \r\nglobal effort to fight climate change.\r\nTurning now to our position on some of the \r\nchallenges facing the United Nations as this session \r\nbegins, I want to reiterate our deep concern over the \r\ninstability in the Middle East, above all the protracted \r\nconflict in Syria. It has had a huge cost in human life \r\nand suffering, as demonstrated by the terrible images of \r\nthe current migration exodus.\r\nAt the same time I would like to highlight the \r\ncentral role played by peacekeeping operations and to \r\nreiterate our full support for their basic principles, which \r\nremain relevant and should be preserved. Guatemala’s \r\ncontribution to such missions is a testament to our \r\nstrong commitment to international peace and security. \r\n24/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nWe believe that an imortant step has been taken in \r\nthe review and assessment of those operations through \r\nthe work of the High-level Independent Panel on all \r\naspects of United Nations peace operations, as well as \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on the implementation \r\nof the Panel’s recommendations (A/70/357), and we \r\nstand ready to start a serious discussion of all measures \r\nthat could improve our contribution to peacekeeping \r\nand the success of such operations.\r\nWe agree with other delegations that the adoption \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) was an important step to carry into \r\nthe future the unfinished tasks of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We join in the clamour for a \r\nresponse in the Paris Climate Summit to the enormous \r\nchallenges posed by climate change and hope that it will \r\nproduce a legally binding instrument. I wish to share \r\nwith the Assembly the fact that Guatemala has already \r\nplayed its part. It has already approved some important \r\nlaws and national documents to present at the Summit.\r\nWe have followed the debate on reforming the \r\nprincipal organs and reviewing their working methods. \r\nWe recognize that the international community is faced \r\nwith limited resources and a plethora of needs and \r\nvulnerable populations to deal with. While recognizing \r\nthe invaluable role played by the United Nations for \r\nhumankind, we warn that the Organization has been \r\nlagging in adapting to the conditions of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. Let us unite efforts to advance this ambitious \r\nagenda for future generations.\r\nFaced with the loss of so many lives in conflicts \r\naround the world, as well as new threats, it is timely \r\nfor  Member States to ask ourselves whether we are \r\nfulfilling the promise on which the Organization was \r\nfounded — “to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war”. But we reiterate our faith in the United \r\nNations as we commemorate its 70 years, and we trust \r\nthat it is in the hands of all the Member States to secure \r\nits growing relevance for the future so as to focus on \r\npeace, security and human rights.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the Chair of \r\nthe Delegation of the Republic of Palau.\r\nMr. Otto (Palau): On behalf of President Tommy \r\nEsang Remengesau Jr., President of the Republic of \r\nPalau, I have the honour to make the following remarks \r\nbefore the General Assembly at its seventieth session.\r\nAt the outset, Palau would like to congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on your election to lead our work during the \r\nseventieth session. We pledge our support for the work \r\nahead. May we also take the opportunity to express our \r\nsincere gratitude to Mr. Sam Kutesa, for his sterling \r\nleadership during the sixty-ninth session.\r\nWe meet here today in perilously challenging, yet \r\nstill hopeful, times. The principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations are more critical to our \r\ncommon future than ever before. We must not only \r\nreaffirm our faith in fundamental human rights and the \r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large \r\nand small, but also redouble our efforts to uphold those \r\nrights. Our collective determination to promote social \r\nprogress and better standards of living must be matched \r\nby our on-the-ground partnerships to fight poverty, \r\nprotect the most vulnerable among us and protect the \r\none planet we call home.\r\nSo while the challenges — violence and war, \r\npoverty and disease, rising seas and wildfires as well \r\nas droughts caused by climate change — are enormous, \r\nso too is the resolve that I share with all here today \r\nto make good on our commitment to transforming our \r\nworld through the urgent and effective implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1).\r\nI would like to congratulate the Secretary-General, \r\nthe co-facilitators and the thousands of people whose \r\ndedicated work made the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals in the 2030 Agenda a strong set of imperatives \r\nfor transformational change that all of our peoples so \r\nurgently need to preserve our cultures, our economies \r\nand our environment and to ensure a sustainable and \r\nprosperous future for our children.\r\nLet me also briefly express my President’s sorrow \r\nat the plight of the countless refugees who are seeking \r\nhavens of peace and prosperity for themselves and for \r\ntheir families as they search for refuge and protection \r\naway from their motherlands, which have been torn \r\nby strife that was sparked and worsened by internal \r\nconflict and/or environmental degradation and climate \r\nchange.\r\nThe theme of the general debate at the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations, “The United \r\nNations at 70: a new commitment to action”, is very \r\nappropriate for this year’s high-level event, the United \r\nNations Summit for the adoption of the new post-\r\n2015 development agenda. It took place just before the \r\n15-29946 25/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\ngeneral debate and adopted resolution 70/1, entitled \r\n“Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development”, containing the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nJust prior to the Summit, His Holiness Pope Francis \r\naddressed the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.3), \r\nreiterating the theme of his papal encyclical, Laudato \r\nsi’, wherein he criticized the careless use of our planet’s \r\nresources leading to environmental degradation and \r\nglobal warming. Let his commentaries serve as an \r\ninspiration to us all that will change hearts, minds and \r\nactions for a better future that will focus the world’s \r\nattention on the most vulnerable among us and on our \r\nMother Earth.\r\nMy friends, we can only hope that a generation \r\nfrom now, this session of the General Assembly will be \r\nremembered as the defining event when the nations of \r\nthe world decided, with the greatest resolve, to reverse \r\nthe tide of the unchecked development and exploitation \r\nof our planet and redouble their efforts to end poverty \r\nand protect the most vulnerable among us and truly \r\ncommitted to transformative action.\r\nFifteen years ago, 189 nations and 23 international \r\norganizations committed to moving forward with \r\nthe eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). \r\nThe Goals served as the framework for a new global \r\ncommitment to reducing extreme poverty, improving \r\nhealth, enhancing environmental sustainability and \r\naddressing gender equality. We now know that progress \r\ntowards achieving these Goals has been impressive but \r\nuneven. Our work to augment these Goals and adopt a \r\nnew set of 17 Sustainable Development Goals reflects \r\na very clear recognition that the results of the MDGs \r\nwould have been more impressive had they addressed \r\nthe underlying causes of poverty and environmental \r\ndegradation, and had Goal 8, on partnerships, been \r\nbetter realized.\r\nThrough 15 years of experience, we now recognize \r\nthat it is only through international cooperation and \r\npartnership with a wide variety of stakeholders that we \r\ncan scale up the urgent action needed to realize the full \r\npotential of sustainable development for our people and \r\nfor the oceans, forests and coastal areas that sustain our \r\ncultures and livelihoods. I am hopeful that now, in 2015, \r\nwe will all embrace the overarching goal represented \r\nby the new Sustainable Development Goals, that is, our \r\ncommitment to revitalizing the global partnership for \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe third International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, held in Addis Ababa in July, was the \r\nfirst test of the degree of commitment on the part of the \r\ndeveloped countries to endowing the new sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda with the means needed to meet \r\nthe new proposed level of ambition. Unfortunately, the \r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda merely reiterated, by and \r\nlarge, the commitments made to the outgoing agenda of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and failed to bridge \r\nthe gap between grand speech-making and down-to-\r\nearth expanded financial commitments.\r\nA more ambitious and reinvigorated global \r\npartnership is clearly required. The annual report \r\nof the MDG Gap Task Force, including the recently \r\nreleased 2015 report, highlighted several shortfalls in \r\ninternational efforts to achieve the MDGs and provided \r\nsobering reminders of the need to substantially \r\nstep up efforts to meet long-standing international \r\ncommitments.\r\nOver four and a half decades ago, the international \r\ncommunity committed to transferring 0.7 per cent of \r\nthe gross national income of the rich countries to the \r\npoorer countries in the form of official development \r\nassistance. To date, the rich nations of the world have \r\ngenerally fallen short of that commitment. In the \r\ncoming decades, affordable and equitable access to \r\ntechnology will be ever more critical if we are to attain \r\nthe designated levels of human progress and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in many areas, including enhancing food \r\nsecurity, improving health, including mental health \r\nand well-being, and preventing non-communicable \r\ndiseases. Technology will be the bedrock for aggressive \r\naction in climate-change mitigation and adaptation, \r\nwhich remain urgent.\r\nLet me reiterate an important point. If our collective \r\nwill to implement the 2030 Agenda is sincere, then it is \r\nessential to greatly enhance the means and mechanisms \r\nof implementation on a much greater scale than those \r\nrecommended in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. \r\nThat is the only way to achieve the promise of a more \r\ninclusive and sustainable world free from hunger and \r\nwhere poverty is eradicated. Let me say it again. That \r\nwill be achieved only through expanded, genuine and \r\ndurable partnerships.\r\nFortunately, my country has a history of strong \r\npartnerships. The United States continues to support \r\nPalau in its development and movement toward economic \r\nindependence. We continue to be strong friends, and \r\n26/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nwe recognize the unique relationship that we share. \r\nWe look forward to completing our Compact of Free \r\nAssociation agreement with the United States, which \r\nreflects that close and special relationship. We wish to \r\nexpress our special gratitude to the United States and \r\nour many other global partners for their support of Goal \r\n14, on oceans, and for the ongoing support towards the \r\npreservation of our largest global resource through the \r\nset-aside of 10 per cent of our global oceans as marine \r\nprotected areas. Finally, we thank the United States \r\nfor its continued and increased assistance to Palau’s \r\nexpanded marine surveillance and enforcement efforts. \r\nThat is critical if we are to successfully protect the \r\nproposed new Palau National Marine Sanctuary.\r\nPalau would also like to acknowledge the great \r\nfriendship that it has with Japan and the very significant \r\neconomic support that we have received from Japan \r\nover the years. We also wish to express our sincere \r\ngratitude for Japan’s generous support and enhanced \r\npublic and private assistance to our marine surveillance \r\nand enforcement efforts. We continue to express our \r\nsupport for the expansion and reform of the Security \r\nCouncil and for Japan’s permanent membership in the \r\nCouncil.\r\nPalau would also like to thank the Republic of \r\nChina on Taiwan for its friendship and economic \r\nsupport in assisting Palau to achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. Palau also wishes to recognize \r\nTaiwan’s commitment to lowering carbon emissions \r\nby 50 per cent by 2050, compared to 2005 levels. We \r\nurge the United Nations system to involve Taiwan in \r\nthe process of implementing the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. Additionally, we advocate \r\nin favour of Taiwan’s participation in the relevant \r\ninternational environmental mechanisms, such as the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. Taiwan possesses technical capacities in \r\nmany areas that can be shared with the world. It \r\nshould therefore also participate in other international \r\nmeetings, mechanisms and frameworks such as \r\nthe World Health Organization, International Civil \r\nAviation Organization, the Trans-Pacific Partnership \r\nAgreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic \r\nPartnership, among others. \r\nThe success and implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals will rest, in great part, on the \r\nstrength of partnerships, which means inclusion rather \r\nthan exclusion. Taiwan has been a valuable partner to \r\nPalau in achieving our MDGs, and we look forward \r\nto our continued partnership with that country as we \r\nembark upon the great challenge of implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nWe would like to express our special gratitude to \r\nIndia for its recent efforts to expand relations with the \r\nPacific Community and to enhance regional cooperation \r\naimed at achieving mutual goals of environmental \r\nrecovery and economic development. Palau reiterates \r\nits support for the reform of the Security Council so \r\nas to allow the Council to reflect more closely the \r\nissues of today’s world, including the security needs \r\nand concerns of the Asia-Pacific region. In that respect, \r\nexpanding the permanent membership category to \r\ninclude India would be welcome.\r\nFinally, we would like also to recognize the very \r\nbroad list of partners across the globe that make our \r\nefforts towards a sustainable future possible, including \r\nthe Governments of Australia and New Zealand \r\nand the European Union, private organizations, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and civil society.\r\nWith the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, we have reaffirmed the \r\ncommitment enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations to fundamental human rights. Inherent in that \r\ncommitment is an obligation to provide appropriate \r\nsupport for the realization of that commitment. As my \r\nPresident often says, at the end of the day the success \r\nof the 2030 Agenda will depend on the strength of the \r\npartnerships we develop.\r\nIt is now time for the world community to develop \r\nthose partnerships and, through them, to commit \r\nto a much expanded and more accessible financing, \r\ntechnology and human-resource capacity. We must \r\nnow match our collective determination to promote \r\nsocial progress and better standards of living with \r\non-the-ground partnerships to fight poverty, protect the \r\nmost vulnerable among us and protect the one planet \r\nthat we call home.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Claude Stanislas Bouah-Kamon, Chair \r\nof the Delegation of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\nMr. Bouah-Kamon (Côte d’Ivoire) (spoke in \r\nFrench): On behalf of His Excellency Mr. Alassane \r\nOuattara, President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, and \r\nmyself, I, like the Heads of State and Government who \r\nhave preceded me in this Hall, would like to congratulate \r\nyou warmly, Mr. President, on your election to the \r\n15-29946 27/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession and to assure you of our support as you carry \r\nout your important and noble mission. I also wish to pay \r\ntribute to your predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Sam \r\nKutesa, for the excellent work accomplished during \r\nhis tenure. And I am especially pleased to salute His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General \r\nof our Organization, for his continued commitment to \r\npeace, security and development around the world.\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations, which coincides with the adoption of \r\na new cycle of development — a bearer of hope — it is \r\nimpossible not to feel moved by the intolerable human \r\ntragedy of migration that is taking place before our \r\neyes, and I take this opportunity to bow to the memory \r\nof so many who have been lost in the Mediterranean. \r\nIn the face of that unprecedented humanitarian drama, \r\nthe international community must take a concerted, \r\ncomprehensive and coherent approach to finding a \r\nhumane response to the crisis of the migrants and \r\nrefugees who are risking their lives to f lee poverty, \r\nmisery, violence and wars. We must all share in that \r\ncommon responsibility.\r\nIn 1945, when the world was still just emerging \r\nfrom the greatest military and humanitarian tragedy of \r\nour time, a few States, joined later by others, brought \r\nthe United Nations to the baptismal font. The adoption \r\nof our Organization’s founding Charter inspired a great \r\nhope in the nations and peoples of the world, a hope \r\nof seeing humankind freed from the scourge of war to \r\nable to build a new world of peace, security and social \r\nprogress. The theme of this year’s general debate, “The \r\nUnited Nations at 70: a new commitment to action” \r\noffers us an excellent opportunity to take stock of the \r\nOrganization’s achievements in relation to its Charter, \r\nand to consider its future in a world assailed by every \r\npossible kind of change.\r\nThe United Nations enjoys enormous authority \r\nand plays an irreplaceable role in helping humankind \r\nto progress on the basis of the Organization’s three \r\nessential pillars: peace, security and development. The \r\n70 years of its existence have unquestionably been \r\nmarked by its continually growing involvement in \r\npromoting democracy and the independence of nations. \r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted \r\nin 1948, called the world’s attention to cases of torture \r\nand massive violations of human rights and created \r\nunprecedented international pressure for greater \r\nrespect for human rights on a global scale.\r\nWhen considering the Organization’s major \r\nachievements, it is also important to note the end of \r\napartheid in South Africa, in which the United Nations \r\nwas one of the main architects. It has played a similar \r\nrole in promoting the rights of women, and in that regard, \r\nwe should emphasize the historic World Conference on \r\nWomen, held in Mexico in 1975, and the memorable \r\nFourth Conference in Beijing in 1995, which enabled \r\nus to define priorities and standards for women’s rights \r\nand gender equality.\r\nIn the area of peace and security, peacekeeping \r\noperations around the world have helped save many \r\nlives and restore stability. In that connection, I would \r\nlike to reiterate the Ivorian people’s gratitude for the \r\ninvaluable role that the United Nations played and \r\ncontinues to play at our side. Thanks to its valuable \r\nsupport, Côte d’Ivoire has begun to make progress \r\nagain, once again finding itself on the road to stability, \r\ngrowth and economic and social development.\r\nThe successes that have been achieved under the \r\nleadership of the United Nations should not blind us to \r\nthe many challenges still facing the Organization and \r\nhumankind. Indeed, peace and security are everywhere \r\nunder threat. Transnational crime is expanding \r\nand threatening international trade. Incitement to \r\nextremism, including by terrorist groups, is gaining \r\nground. Boko Haram, which has become what amounts \r\nto the Islamic State in West Africa, continues to sow \r\ndesolation and terror. Cybercrime is growing, and \r\npoverty, despite efforts to eradicate it, remains an \r\nabiding concern and an obstacle to the development and \r\nwell-being of peoples.\r\nBesides such threats, we are witnessing the \r\npersistence of internal and regional conflicts in many \r\nparts of the world. The international community must \r\nbe vigilant regarding the conflicts in the Middle East \r\nand the situations in Syria, Libya and Western Sahara. \r\nConcerning the issue of Western Sahara, Côte d’Ivoire \r\nwould like to affirm its support for the negotiation \r\nprocess being conducted under the auspices of the \r\nUnited Nations, and we call on the parties to display \r\na spirit of compromise in order to settle the dispute \r\nwithin the framework of the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and Morocco’s autonomy plan.\r\nOur peoples have great and urgent expectations, \r\nand they believe that it is up to the United Nations \r\nto demonstrate a new commitment to action. That \r\ncommitment should be embodied in the implementation \r\n28/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nof the programmes of the new post-2015 development \r\nagenda in the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), which the Assembly \r\nadopted at the special Summit devoted to promoting the \r\nnew Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nThe new 2030 Agenda gives us a historic opportunity \r\nto promote an ambitious development programme aimed \r\nat significantly reducing poverty and hunger around \r\nthe world, improving people’s health and education and \r\nfighting the adverse effects of climate change together. \r\nIt should also promote good governance measures, \r\nwhich will help to redistribute wealth to the poor and \r\nvulnerable and bring back a genuine partnership for \r\ndevelopment so that we can build a world of prosperity, \r\nequality, security and peace, in the spirit and letter of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. \r\nPoverty, terrorism, epidemics, food and climate \r\ninsecurity — today’s new threats to international peace \r\nand security — make fertile ground for the intolerance, \r\nfundamentalism and extremism of every sort that \r\nthreaten the fragile edifice of world peace to which our \r\npopulations legitimately aspire.\r\nWe cannot deny that the world is facing a time \r\nof great challenges, but it is also true that we have a \r\nhistoric opportunity to strengthen the foundations \r\nfor inclusive development and a better world for both \r\ncurrent and future generations. I am therefore delighted \r\nthat this seventieth anniversary coincides with a year \r\nthat gives us hope. Indeed, the third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development, held in \r\nAddis Ababa from 13 to 16 July, enabled us to agree on \r\nways to implement the 2030 Agenda that we have just \r\nadopted. We need to finish the job at the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nto be held in December in Paris, in order to achieve a \r\nbinding global commitment that will enable us to fight \r\neffectively against global warming.\r\nThe new development programme that we have just \r\nadopted capitalizes on the experience of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and holistically integrates the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development, namely the \r\neconomic, social and environmental dimensions. It puts \r\nus on the right path to make the transition to a better \r\nworld for all humankind. \r\nWhile we are justified in celebrating the new \r\nAgenda and its Sustainable Development Goals as the \r\nnew consensual paradigm for development, the most \r\ndifficult task is still ahead of us. Each State needs to \r\noperationalize all of those programmes through the \r\nestablishment of appropriate policies and reforms at the \r\nnational level.\r\nThat is the underlying purpose of the national \r\ndevelopment plan that has been drawn up by the \r\nIvorian Government for the period 2016-2020 with \r\na view to making Côte d’Ivoire an emerging country \r\nby 2020. Our objective is to halve the poverty rate in \r\nour country. With regard to the economy, according \r\nto the World Bank’s report Doing Business 2015, for \r\nthe second consecutive year Côte d’Ivoire is among \r\nthe 10 countries in the world that have implemented \r\nthe largest number of reforms to improve the business \r\nenvironment.\r\nAs a result of those reforms, Côte d’Ivoire has \r\nbeen among the front-runners of high-growth countries \r\nin Africa and throughout the world since 2012. The \r\naverage growth rate of the gross domestic product for \r\nthe period 2012-2014 was above 9 per cent. During the \r\npast three years the per capita income has improved by \r\nabout 20 per cent. In education, after introducing free \r\nschooling in 2011, the Government has made school \r\nattendance compulsory for all children aged from 6 \r\nto 16 years, beginning with the current school year, \r\nin order to translate into reality the right of all girls \r\nand boys in our country to high-quality education and \r\ntraining. With regard to health, in order to provide \r\nmedical coverage for all Ivorians, we have initiated a \r\nsystem of universal health coverage, thereby enabling \r\nthe most disadvantaged to be treated in the various \r\nhealth units of our country.\r\nThe year 2015, which is slipping rapidly away, \r\nis pivotal also because on 25 October our open \r\nand inclusive general elections will begin. In that \r\nconnection, I welcome the decision of the Security \r\nCouncil in resolution 2226 (2015), of 25 June 2015, to \r\nauthorize the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire \r\nto provide logistical support to Côte d’Ivoire during \r\nthe elections. For its part, the Government of Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, which has established a permanent framework \r\nfor dialogue with the opposition, will do everything \r\npossible to ensure the credibility of the electoral process \r\nin order to consolidate the newly found peace.\r\nWith regard to the national reconciliation process, \r\nthe National Commission for Reconciliation and \r\nCompensation for Victims, which the Government \r\n15-29946 29/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nestablished to complete the work of the Dialogue, \r\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission, is currently \r\nin the process of compensating victims. The \r\ndemobilization, disarmament and reintegration process \r\nhas been successfully completed with an 85 per cent \r\nreintegration rate of ex-combatants. All those results \r\nwill be sustainable only if the economy performs well. \r\nThe economic recovery we have seen over the past four \r\nyears, with a constantly increasing growth rate, has \r\nbenefited from the support of our partners, and I would \r\nlike to thank them.\r\nI would like to conclude by emphasizing that the \r\nimage of a better world conjured up by the founding \r\nfathers of our Organization is more compelling than \r\never. Our adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment opens up new prospects for development, \r\nfor the benefit of peoples everywhere. We therefore \r\nappeal to the proven leadership of the United Nations \r\nand call for the decisive impact it can make in helping \r\nto push back the frontiers of poverty and to provide \r\nhumankind with better access to safe drinking water, \r\na rapid reduction in infant mortality, enhanced food \r\nsecurity and a healthy environment.\r\nTime is of the essence. The time has come for \r\naction.\r\nThe President: We have now heard the last speaker \r\nin the general debate.\r\nI should like to make some closing remarks as we \r\nconclude our debate.\r\nWe have reached the end of a historic nine days \r\nat the United Nations and a historic, comprehensive \r\ngeneral debate. This year we saw the highest number \r\nof Heads of State and Government ever gathered here \r\nto discuss challenges and opportunities relating to \r\nglobal peace, security, development and human rights. \r\nAs we commemorated the seventieth anniversary, the \r\nfact that leaders recalled and reaffirmed the spirit and \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nconfirmed their faith in the central role of the United \r\nNations in international cooperation was fitting and \r\nappropriate. The fact that a meeting with His Holiness \r\nPope Francis and the Summit at which Member States \r\nadopted the universal 2030 Agenda on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) preceded the general \r\ndebate was also apt. The 2030 Agenda is a truly seminal \r\ncommitment by our community of nations.\r\nAt the outset, let me thank all the speakers who \r\naddressed generous words and congratulations to me \r\nand promised their support. The seventieth session will \r\nbe an exceptionally busy one, and the general debate has \r\nhelped to identify the specific issues that the Member \r\nStates feel deserve our dedicated attention. Since the \r\nSummit had focused on sustainable development, I \r\nsuggested that the general debate should focus on the \r\nroad ahead for peace,security and human rights. \r\nOne of the matters most consistently raised over \r\nthe past six days was the plight of refugees, internally \r\ndisplaced persons and migrants right across our \r\nworld. Speakers stressed again and again that this \r\nunprecedented crisis of global dimensions calls for an \r\nunprecedented global response rooted in international \r\nlaw and international solidarity. Building on the \r\nSecretary-General’s meeting this week, therefore, I \r\nwill attend the 2015 annual meetings of the World Bank \r\nGroup and the International Monetary Fund in Lima \r\nnext Friday, at which finance ministers will be present. \r\nThere, I will highlight the need for an immediate focus \r\non financing the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and the even more urgent need for \r\na comprehensive financing response to the ongoing \r\nhumanitarian crisis. Furthermore, in mid- to late \r\nNovember I will hold a meeting dedicated to the global \r\nrefugee crisis.\r\nThe tragic humanitarian emergency in many parts \r\nof the world, not least in Syria and its neighbouring \r\ncountries, was repeatedly highlighted in the general \r\ndebate. In relation to the Syrian conflict, many called \r\nfor a renewed effort from global and regional Powers \r\nto find the necessary peaceful political solution. The \r\nsituation in other parts of the Middle East, including \r\nthe now stalled Middle East peace process, was also \r\nhighlighted as a major source of concern. In addition, \r\nmany Member States stressed the need to address the \r\nparticular obstacles to peace in Africa, parts of Europe \r\nand beyond that stemmed from instability, violent \r\nconflict and the spread of extremism and terrorism. \r\nThe radical actions of the Islamic State in Iraq and the \r\nLevant, Boko Haram, Al-Shabaab and other extremist \r\ngroups were unanimously denounced and rejected as an \r\naffront to our common humanity.\r\nWith regard to the capacities of the United Nations \r\nitself for maintaining international peace and security, \r\nmany acknowledged the Secretary-General’s initiative \r\nlaunching a review of United Nations peace operations, \r\nstressing the importance of prevention as key to \r\npreserving peace and stability and the need to address \r\nthe root causes of conflict. The growing role of regional \r\n30/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nand subregional organizations in safeguarding peace \r\nand security was highlighted.\r\nNumerous Member States also highlighted the \r\ncritical importance of addressing challenges related \r\nto disarmament, ranging from threats posed by \r\nsmall arms and light weapons all the way to nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation. In that connection, the nuclear \r\nagreement between Iran, the five permanent members \r\nof the Security Council, Germany and the European \r\nUnion was widely recognized as an important step and \r\na significant diplomatic achievement. Similarly, many \r\nwelcomed the re-establishment of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States.\r\nThe pressing need to address climate change by \r\nreaching an agreement in Paris at the forthcoming \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange was repeatedly raised by delegations, not least \r\nthose of small island States and others particularly \r\nvulnerable to the effects of climate change. Indeed, \r\nsince the beginning of the Summit last week, more than \r\n70 countries have submitted their intended nationally \r\ndetermined contributions, bringing to 146 the number \r\nof parties that have demonstrated their belief that Paris \r\ncan and must succeed, and that it can and must bring \r\nhope and opportunity to millions of people across the \r\nglobe.\r\nLooking ahead, many leaders identified the need \r\nfor a successful conclusion to the 10-year review of the \r\nWorld Summit on the Information Society. They also \r\nexpressed hope that the special meeting on the global \r\ndrug problem will be able to deliver concrete outcomes.\r\nConcerning the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nnumerous leaders recalled that universal implementation \r\nis now imperative, and that financing — including the \r\nneed for developed countries to meet their minimum \r\ntarget of 0.7 per cent of gross national income for \r\naid — as well as technology and the fight against \r\ncorruption are essential pieces of the puzzle.\r\nIn the field of health, we heard encouraging news \r\nfrom West Africa, where the Ebola epidemic, while \r\nnot yet over, has been addressed with courage and \r\ndetermination by the affected countries, with assistance \r\nfrom the United Nations and the wider world.\r\nIn the area of human rights, some recalled the \r\nchallenges around the world related to discrimination \r\nagainst various groups and to the protection of the \r\nspace in which civil society operates. Many also noted \r\nthe importance of making further progress in realizing \r\nthe rights of women and girls. The high-level review \r\nand global study of the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace \r\nand security, were highlighted by many as an important \r\nprocess for the coming year.\r\nTurning to organizational and institutional matters, \r\nnumerous interventions stressed the pressing need \r\nto reform the Security Council if it is to be able to \r\neffectively fulfil its mandate and reflect the geopolitical \r\nrealities of the world of today and tomorrow. In the \r\nsame vein, hopes were expressed about the possibility \r\nof establishing a transparent process over the coming \r\nyear in order to identify the next Secretary-General.\r\nThat is merely a synopsis of the many issues raised \r\nin the past six days. The breadth and depth of the \r\ndiscussions demonstrate once again that the task ahead \r\nof our Organization is enormous. As President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its historic seventieth session, I \r\nwould like to assure members that I will do all I can \r\nto help everyone make real and significant progress \r\nacross each of the three pillars.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express my sincere \r\nappreciation to all the staff of the United Nations who \r\nhave made this week such a success. In particular, I \r\nwould like thank our colleagues in the Department \r\nof General Assembly and Conference Management, \r\nincluding the interpreters, and the security, catering \r\nand maintenance staff and others. Their professionalism \r\nhas been outstanding and a credit to themselves and \r\nthis great Organization.\r\nSeveral representatives have asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. I would like to remind \r\nmembers that statements in exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention \r\nand five minutes for the second, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Gae Luna (Indonesia): My delegation is taking \r\nthe f loor to exercise its right of reply to statements \r\nmade by the delegations of Tonga and Solomon Islands \r\non 29 September and 1 October, respectively (see \r\nA/70/PV.18 and A/70/PV.23). My delegation objects \r\nstrongly to references made in those statements to \r\nthe so-called human rights issue in West Papua. They \r\nare dangerously misleading and therefore compel my \r\ndelegation to set the record straight.\r\n15-29946 31/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nThe protection and promotion of human rights \r\nhas always been one of my Government’s priorities. \r\nIndonesia’s Constitution and national laws provide \r\na solid guarantee of respect for the human rights of \r\nevery person in Indonesia. It is my delegation’s firm \r\nconviction that no country, big or small, developed or \r\nless developed, is free from human rights problems, \r\nand Indonesia is no exception. However, as a mature \r\ndemocracy, the fourth largest in the world, Indonesia has \r\nput in place a robust national human rights protection \r\nsystem and continues to strengthen its human rights \r\ninstitutions and legislation.\r\nIt has also been the long-term practice of the \r\nGovernment of Indonesia to work together with \r\nits vibrant national civil society and human rights \r\ninstitutions to promote and protect human rights. \r\nThose institutions provide the checks and independent \r\nreviews necessary to ensure that human rights are \r\nproperly monitored and protected. In other words, the \r\nevolving national mechanisms in Indonesia are reliable \r\nand capable of addressing in a democratic manner \r\nany human rights issues whenever they may emerge, \r\nincluding those that persist. Indonesia also remains \r\nactively engaged regionally and globally, and continues \r\nto make meaningful contributions in the field of human \r\nrights, including by sharing its experiences in the areas \r\nof capacity-building and best practices in the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights.\r\nWe respect expressions of concern made by \r\nany party about human rights situations anywhere, \r\nincluding in Indonesia generally or in certain parts \r\nof the country. My delegation is not convinced, \r\nhowever, that the references in the statements by the \r\naforementioned delegations are appropriate or have \r\nany merit. Indeed, they contain inaccurate allegations \r\nconcerning the human rights situation in certain parts \r\nof Indonesia and indicate political motivation beyond \r\nhuman rights considerations. Furthermore, they include \r\na misrepresentation of the facts.\r\nThe Government of Indonesia continues to invest \r\nsignificant resources in and to pay close attention to the \r\ndevelopment of all areas of life in its provinces of Papua \r\nand West Papua, and this includes the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. The two provinces enjoy \r\nwide-ranging autonomy, guaranteed by national laws, \r\nincluding in the election of governors and other heads \r\nof regional governments. The Government continues to \r\ndo its utmost to be accountable to the peoples of Papua \r\nand West Papua, including in the areas of human rights.\r\nThe Government of Indonesia attaches great \r\nimportance to its relations with Pacific Island countries, \r\nas some peoples of Indonesia have strong commonalities \r\nwith the peoples of the Pacific Islands region. It has \r\nbeen our national policy to cherish commonalities as \r\na way of bridging diversity. Therefore, let me reiterate \r\nthat the Government of Indonesia is committed to \r\ncontinuing its engagement, in good faith, with Pacific \r\nIsland countries for common peace and prosperity in \r\nthe region.\r\nMr. Va’inga Tone (Tonga): I thank you, \r\nMr. President, for giving me the opportunity to \r\nrespond to the comments made by the representative \r\nof Indonesia.\r\nAt the outset, let me state that Tonga values its \r\ndiplomatic relations with Indonesia. It recognizes the \r\nsovereignty of Indonesia over its population and its \r\naffairs. However, Tonga, having received reports of \r\nalleged human rights violations, has concerns about \r\nthese reports. It proposes the holding of a friendly \r\ndialogue among Indonesia, Tonga and other Pacific \r\nIsland countries to improve understanding and to \r\nconduct a fact-finding mission, with the cooperation of \r\nIndonesia, to learn more about these allegations.\r\nTonga holds Indonesia and its diplomatic relations \r\nwith Indonesia in high regard and simply would like \r\nto register, as has been said by my Prime Minister, \r\nits concerns about the allegations concerning human \r\nrights violations. However, there is room for further \r\ndialogue. As part of the proposed solution for this and \r\nto address its concerns, Tonga would like to engage in \r\nfurther dialogue with Indonesia.\r\nMrs. Vadiati (Islamic Republic of Iran): I \r\nrequested the f loor to speak in exercise of the right of \r\nreply in reaction to the baseless remarks made by the \r\nrepresentative of Bahrain in his statement yesterday in \r\nthis Assembly (see A/70/PV.25). He repeated fabricated \r\nallegations, accusing Iran of intervening in the domestic \r\naffairs of Bahrain. We reject these allegations and \r\nreiterate that they are illusory and fabricated.\r\nThe accusations that the Bahraini representative \r\nlevelled against Iran are all the more worthless in \r\nthat they amount to desperate efforts to cover up the \r\nviolation by his Government of the basic rights of the \r\nmajority of the Bahraini people. In those efforts, he also \r\nsought to justify the rule of the minority on the island \r\nand the blatant trampling of the rights of the majority, \r\nwho are deprived of any meaningful participation in the \r\n32/33 15-29946\r\nA/70/PV.28 03/10/2015\r\nrunning of the country. There should be no doubt that \r\nas long as a minority continues to suppress the right of \r\nthe majority of the population, no attempt, including \r\nputting the blame on outsiders, will ever help to resolve \r\nthe problems.\r\nMore outlandish and bizarre were the comments \r\nby the representative of Bahrain and later by the \r\nrepresentative of the United Arab Emirates (see A/70/\r\nPV.26) in reaction to Iran’s remarks about the way the \r\nHajj pilgrimage was organized in Mecca this year and \r\nthe way the pilgrims were treated. It is obvious that \r\nthe statements made by those two representatives are \r\nunwarranted and certainly unhelpful, as that issue is \r\nnone of their business.\r\nA wrong appellation was used by the representatives \r\nof Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates in their \r\nstatements, apparently in reference to the body of water \r\nsituated between the Arabian peninsula and the Iranian \r\nplateau. They should know, as the entire world does, \r\nthat the historical and formally recognized appellation, \r\nincluding by the United Nations, for that body of water \r\nis the Persian Gulf. It has been so since the fifth century \r\nB.C. and has remained the same to the current day. The \r\nsame proper name was also used by the Arab people of \r\nthat time and in all Arab texts up through the political \r\nturmoil in the 1960s. It is unfortunate that, despite the \r\nfading of the political rationale behind this distortion, \r\nsome Arab officials still continue to use this outdated \r\nand Cold War-tainted term. Needless to say, that \r\npolitically motivated change in geographical names is \r\nrejected by the relevant United Nations committees and \r\nconferences, as it creates tension and has many other \r\nadverse consequences. \r\nSimilarly, with respect to the remarks on the issue \r\nof the three Iranian islands, the Government of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran reiterates its full sovereignty \r\nover the Iranian islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tunb \r\nand Lesser Tunb in the Persian Gulf and underlines \r\nthat decisions and measures applied in those islands by \r\nthe Iranian authorities have always been based on the \r\nprinciple of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nIran. Therefore, any claims to the contrary are deemed \r\nas interference in the internal affairs of Iran, which is \r\ncategorically rejected.\r\nThe Government of Iran has always pursued a \r\npolicy of friendship and good neighbourliness with all \r\nneighbouring countries and, in this context, once again \r\nexpresses its readiness to engage in bilateral talks with \r\nthe United Arab Emirates with a view to continuing \r\nto strengthen bilateral relations and removing any \r\nmisunderstandings that may exist between the two \r\ncountries. Meanwhile, it is obvious that the territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran over the said islands is not negotiable.\r\nIran categorically rejects the allegations that the \r\nrepresentative of Canada levelled againt my country \r\nearlier in this meeting. From his remarks, it is clear how \r\ndeeply Canada’s conservative Government grieves the \r\nloss of the smokescreen it needed to hide its years of \r\npursuing a policy of distorting facts directed against \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and how deeply they resent \r\nthe nuclear deal between Iran and the P5+1, because \r\nit undermines their policy of Iranophobia. It is no \r\nwonder that Canada, with a very questionable human \r\nrights record — in particular with regard to the rights \r\nof immigrants, African Canadians and indigenous \r\npeople — and also as a relentless supporter of the \r\nIsraeli crimes against the Palestinians, has pursued \r\nthe old, worn-out policy of the so-called champion of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nMr. Beck (Solomon Islands): In response to the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Indonesia \r\nin right of reply, Solomon Islands would like to first \r\nreiterate our deep respect for Indonesia’s sovereignty \r\nand our relations with that country. We also take note of \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Indonesia.\r\nWe would like to reiterate that the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations is based on three pillars: peace \r\nand security, human rights, and development. My \r\ndelegation also wishes to reiterate that all States have a \r\nlegal duty and a moral responsibility to uphold, respect \r\nand promote human rights and, when necessary, take \r\npreventive, protective and punitive measures against \r\nhuman rights abuses and violations, in accordance with \r\nthe Charter and applicable international law.\r\nOn the issue of human rights violations in Papua \r\nand West Papua, we have made it clear in our prior \r\nstatement to the General Assembly (see A/70/PV.23) \r\nthat we would like to work with Indonesia and with \r\nall members of the United Nations Human Rights \r\nCouncil — that is, within the multilateral system —\r\non this particular issue. We therefore welcome what \r\nhas been said by the representative of Indonesia. We \r\nwelcome Indonesia’s commitment to work in good \r\nfaith not only with Solomon Islands, not only with the \r\nPacific Islands Forum countries, but with all of us in \r\n15-29946 33/33\r\n03/10/2015 A/70/PV.28\r\nterms of addressing human rights violations wherever \r\nthey may occur.\r\nIn this respect, I wish to underscore that we seek \r\ndialogue and cooperation with Indonesia, as alluded to \r\nby the leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum, and would \r\nlike to work with that country in order to address some \r\nof these issues within the framework of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and international law.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 8?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 7 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items\r\nSecond report of the General Committee \r\n(A/70/250/Add.1)\r\nThe President: In paragraph 1 (a) of its second \r\nreport, the General Committee decides to recommend \r\nto the General Assembly that an additional sub-item \r\nentitled “Appointment of the Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Internal Oversight Services” be included \r\nin the agenda of the current session under heading I, \r\n“Organizational, administrative and other matters”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides \r\nto include this sub-item in the agenda of the current \r\nsession under heading I?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 1 (b), the General \r\nCommittee further recommends that the sub-item be \r\nconsidered directly in plenary meeting.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to \r\nconsider this sub-item directly in plenary meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members \r\nthat the sub-item entitled “Appointment of the Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Internal Oversight Services” \r\nbecomes sub-item (i) of item 114 on the agenda of the \r\ncurrent session.\r\nIn paragraph 2 (a) of the report, the General \r\nCommittee recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nan additional item entitled “Observer status for the \r\nUnion for the Mediterranean in the General Assembly” \r\nbe included in the agenda of the current session under \r\nheading I, “Organizational, administrative and other \r\nmatters”.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to \r\ninclude this item in the agenda of the current session \r\nunder heading I?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In paragraph 2 (b), the General \r\nCommittee further recommends that the item be \r\nallocated to the Sixth Committee. May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides to allocate this item to the \r\nSixth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to inform Members \r\nthat the item “Observer status for the Union for the \r\nMediterranean in the General Assembly” becomes item \r\n174 on the agenda of the current session. The Chair of \r\nthe Sixth Committee will be informed of the decision \r\njust taken by the General Assembly.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.35 p.m.\r\n"
