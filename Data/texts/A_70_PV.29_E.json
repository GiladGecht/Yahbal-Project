That official should be appointed by \r\nthe Secretary-General, following consultations with \r\nMember States, and approved by the General Assembly. \r\nFor that purpose, the Secretary-General should appoint \r\nthe Under-Secretary-General for Internal Oversight \r\nServices with due regard for geographic rotation and, in \r\ndoing so shall be guided by the provisions of paragraph \r\n3 (e) of resolution 46/232, of 2 March 1992, whereby the \r\nAssembly decided in particular that, as a general rule, \r\nno national of a Member State shall succeed a national \r\nof that State in a senior post and that there should be \r\nno monopoly on senior posts by nationals of any State \r\nor group of States. The official should serve for one \r\nfixed term of five years without possibility of renewal \r\nand may be removed by the Secretary-General only for \r\ncause and with the approval of the General Assembly.\r\nIn the light of the provisions of resolution 48/218 B, \r\nthe Secretary-General proposes to appoint Ms. Heidi \r\nMendoza as Under-Secretary-General for Internal \r\nOversight Services for one fixed term of five years, \r\nbeginning on 15 November 2015 and ending on \r\n14 November 2020.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to approve that appointment?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Thöresson (Sweden): I have the honour today \r\nto speak on behalf of the five Nordic countries, namely, \r\nDenmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and my own \r\ncountry, Sweden.\r\nThe Nordic countries warmly welcome the \r\nappointment of Ms. Heidi Mendoza as Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Internal Oversight Services. We would like \r\nto congratulate her on her new functions, and we look \r\nforward to working closely with Ms. Mendoza over the \r\ncoming five years.\r\nThe Nordic countries attach great importance to \r\nthe oversight functions at the United Nations. Those \r\nfunctions are crucial to the whole United Nations system \r\nand to the Member States in ensuring an efficient, \r\neffective, transparent and accountable United Nations. \r\nOver the past few months, we have been concerned \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.29\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n29th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 12 October 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nby the negative attention that the Office for Internal \r\nOversight Services has attracted as a result of the \r\nUnited Nations handling of the situation in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. Independence and transparency are \r\nprerequisites for effective oversight. An operationally \r\nindependent Office for Internal Oversight Services is \r\nkey to fulfilling the many important tasks assigned \r\nto the Office as well as to rebuilding the confidence \r\namong Member States that the Office can play a role \r\nin protecting the integrity of the United Nations and \r\npromoting accountability within the Organization.\r\nOn the eve of the United Nations seventieth \r\nanniversary, and with several large transformative \r\nreform initiatives on the table, the importance of \r\noversight cannot be overestimated. The Nordic \r\ncountries are confident that Ms. Mendoza will lead the \r\nOffice for Internal Oversight Services effectively and \r\nefficiently through these important times at the United \r\nNations, and she can count on our full support in that \r\nendeavour.\r\nMs. Yparraguirre (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nwelcomes the appointment by the Secretary-General \r\nof Ms. Heidi Mendoza as Under-Secretary-General \r\nfor Internal Oversight Services. We would like to \r\nexpress our deep appreciation for the endorsement of \r\nthat appointment by the regional groups and for the \r\naffirmation it received today from Member States. It is \r\na great honour for the Philippines that a highly qualified \r\nwoman from the developing world has been chosen to \r\nserve in a senior position in the United Nations. We \r\nare fully confident that she will serve with the highest \r\nstandards of efficiency, competence and integrity and \r\nwill continue the good work of her predecessor in the \r\nOffice for Internal Oversight Services, Ms. Carman \r\nLapointe.\r\nMs. Mendoza will leave her post as Commissioner \r\nin the Philippine Commission of Audit, where she \r\nhas served for over 20 years in the areas of audit, \r\ninvestigation, fraud examination and good governance. \r\nHer vast experience as Chairperson of the Audit \r\nCommittee of the Public Sector Standards Board \r\nand External Auditor for the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations, the World Health \r\nOrganization and the International Labour Organization \r\nrenders her most able to take on that important new \r\nportfolio.\r\nHer qualifications and wealth of experience, \r\ncoupled with her commitment to excellence and \r\nintegrity, make her a wise choice for the job. Those \r\nqualifications are crucial at this juncture in the history \r\nof the United Nations, which is celebrating its seventieth \r\nanniversary, moving forward with the ambitious 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \r\nand pursuing a platform for reforms in various fields of \r\nUnited Nations work.\r\nGood governance, the rule of law and effective, \r\naccountable and transparent institutions within the \r\nUnited Nations itself are necessary for ensuring that \r\nthe United Nations continues to be a credible champion \r\nin the global fight against corruption and achieves its \r\nlofty goals. We are fully confident that Ms. Mendoza \r\nwill live up to those challenges as she steps into the \r\nrole of assisting the Secretary-General in fulfilling the \r\noversight responsibilities over the resources and staff \r\nof the Organization through internal audit, monitoring, \r\ninspection, evaluation and investigation services.\r\nMs. Coleman (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States welcomes the appointment of Heidi \r\nMendoza as the next Under-Secretary-General for \r\nInternal Oversight Services. We extend our warm \r\ncongratulations to her and take this opportunity to \r\nunderscore the importance of the Office for Internal \r\nOversight Services (OIOS) and its independent role in \r\nproviding critical oversight over the United Nations. \r\nThe United States is committed to ensuring a strong \r\nOIOS that is able to carry out robust audits and \r\neffective investigations to ferret out waste, fraud and \r\ncorruption. The Office must have the ability to conduct \r\nperformance evaluations of key programmes, thereby \r\nenabling management and Member States to ensure \r\neffective use of resources. We look forward to working \r\nwith Ms. Mendoza and engaging with Member States to \r\nstrengthen OIOS.\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded its consideration of sub-item (i) of agenda \r\nitem 114.\r\nAgenda item 138\r\nScale of assessments for the apportionment of the \r\nexpenses of the United Nations\r\nDraft resolution (A/70/416)\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now take a \r\ndecision on the draft resolution recommended by the \r\nFifth Committee in paragraph 6 of its report.\r\nThe Fifth Committee adopted the draft resolution, \r\nentitled “Scale of assessments for the apportionment \r\n15-30802 3/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nof the expenses of the United Nations: requests under \r\nArticle 19 of the Charter”, without a vote. May I take it \r\nthat the Assembly wishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 70/2).\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 138.\r\nAgenda item 122\r\nStrengthening of the United Nations system\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/70357)\r\nIdentical letters dated 17 June 2015 from the \r\nSecretary-General addressed to the President \r\nof the General Assembly and the President of \r\nthe Security Council (A/70/95)\r\nThe President: Peace operations are the heart \r\nof the United Nations global engagement. They are \r\namong the major innovations since the inception of the \r\nUnited Nations that have enabled the Organization to \r\nbetter fulfil its mandate and have contributed to peace \r\nand security in our world. But peace operations, like \r\nany tool, are in constant need of refinement. Evolving \r\nchallenges and threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity make it necessary for the United Nations to \r\nstrengthen its role, capacity, efficiency and, more \r\nparticularly, the effectiveness of its field operations.\r\nToday’s debate is both necessary and timely. The \r\ndramatic global refugee crisis and other humanitarian \r\nand ongoing security crises demonstrate just how \r\ncomplex today’s conflicts have become. In the light \r\nof those new realities, we must review our practices \r\nand instruments, how we approach policy and \r\noperational questions and how we address budgetary \r\nand management issues. I therefore commend the \r\nSecretary-General for having taken the initiative to \r\nlaunch this review. The High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations consulted rigorously, and its work \r\nresulted in a number of concrete recommendations. \r\nSubsequently, Member States have received the \r\nSecretary-General’s implementation report (A/70/357).\r\nHaving examined those important contributions, it \r\nis now up to the membership to consider how that key \r\ninitiative can be transformed into concrete steps that \r\nwill ensure that the United Nations peace operations \r\ncan adequately respond to our changing world. That \r\nis a unique opportunity and, at the end of today’s \r\ndebate, I will return to the question of how best to offer \r\nprocedural clarity on the next steps. It is of course also \r\nworth bearing in mind that that review of the United \r\nNations peace operations is complemented by the \r\n10-year review of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture and a global study on the implementation \r\nof Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women \r\nand peace and security. An effort to ensure the synergy \r\nand coherence generated by those three reviews will \r\npromote a holistic reflection on matters that are clearly \r\ninterconnected. Facts on the ground, including threats \r\nto global security, such as epidemics, violent extremism \r\nand proliferation, among others, are powerful evidence \r\nthat a comprehensive and more integrated approach \r\nto peace and security is urgently needed. On 10 and \r\n11 May 2016, I will convene a high-level thematic debate \r\nin order to advance synergies generated by those three \r\nreviews. The participation of Member States and all \r\nstakeholders in the preparations for that debate, in the \r\nevent itself and in its possible follow-up will be crucial. \r\nWe have a common interest to have a United Nations \r\nthat is truly equipped to translate the objectives of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations into concrete reality, and \r\na shared responsibility to make that happen.\r\nI now give the f loor to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon to start the discussion.\r\nThe Secretary-General: I thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for bringing us together for a \r\nparticularly timely debate on how to best to strengthen \r\nUnited Nations peace operations.\r\nIn recent years, all of us have grown deeply \r\nconcerned about the escalating challenges confronting \r\nUnited Nations peace operations, both peacekeeping \r\nand special political missions. One year ago today, I \r\nappointed a High-level Independent Panel on Peace \r\nOperations to assess our operations and suggest ways to \r\nmeet those tests. President José Ramos-Horta of Timor-\r\nLeste, with wide-ranging national and United Nations \r\nexperience, was uniquely suited to lead that effort. \r\nMs. Ameerah Haq, who has served as Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations and as Vice-Chair \r\nof the Panel, has also had extensive exposure to the \r\nrealities that the United Nations faces in the field. I \r\nam very pleased that both are with us today. The task \r\nwas ambitious and the timing was short, yet the Panel \r\ndelivered its report, entitled “Report of the High-level \r\nIndependent Panel on Peace Operations on uniting our \r\nstrengths for peace: politics, partnership and people” \r\n(see A/70/95). The Panel’s report is wise and bold and \r\nreflects the results of consultations with the diverse \r\nstakeholders in every region of the world. I thank the \r\n4/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nPanel for its outstanding service on behalf of all those \r\naround the world living under the threat or the reality \r\nof conflict.\r\nLast month, I submitted to Member States my \r\nimplementation report (A/70/357). It conveys my strong \r\nsupport for the Panel’s recommendations and identifies \r\nthose areas where I believe we can move forward \r\nimmediately. My report calls for the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council to consider a number of \r\nimportant recommendations directed at Member States \r\nand which I fully endorse. It deliberately leaves some \r\nof the structural proposals to my successor, but I \r\nwholeheartedly support the need for those changes to \r\nbe given serious consideration.\r\nUnited Nations peace operations are a global \r\ninstrument. Making them fit for purpose is a collective \r\nresponsibility. I hope that today will mark the start of \r\nearly and concerted efforts to strengthen a set of vital \r\ntools at this time when they are most in need. The \r\nhistoric adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nlast month, underscores a long-standing truth — there \r\nwill be no peace without development, no development \r\nwithout peace, and neither without respect for human \r\nrights.\r\nThe case for renewed investment in United Nations \r\npeace operations is urgent and clear. We are living in \r\na time of global turmoil. Large-scale conflicts have \r\ntripled since 2008. More than 60 million people have \r\nbeen forcibly displaced, the most since the Second \r\nWorld War. Violent extremism is on the rise. I fully \r\nendorse the Panel’s call for a focus on politics, people \r\nand partnership. United Nations peace operations are \r\npolitical tools. Their objective is to pursue and sustain \r\nnegotiated political settlements. They cannot substitute \r\nfor a clear political strategy to bring an end to conflict. \r\nNor should they be used to give the appearance of \r\naction, or given mandates without the means. Peace \r\noperations must be used responsibly. United Nations \r\npeace operations must be judged by their impact on \r\npeople. They must make every effort to protect civilians \r\nand defend the rights of people in conflict. And they \r\nmust never abuse that trust.\r\nThe United Nations cannot tackle today’s challenges \r\nalone. We must strengthen partnerships to meet the \r\ngrowing complexity of conflicts. In my implementation \r\nreport I set out an agenda for action to translate those \r\npriorities into concrete steps over the next 18 months.\r\nFirst, we need to bring prevention and mediation \r\nto the centre of our efforts to promote international \r\npeace and security. Early action saves lives and money. \r\nEffective prevention and mediation keep politics at the \r\nfore. As the toll of human lives rises and humanitarian \r\nneeds and costs escalate dramatically, I am calling for a \r\nconcerted prevention agenda that makes greater use of \r\nthe full range of tools, including my good offices.\r\nSecondly, we need to change the way we plan and \r\nconduct United Nations peace operations. We need to \r\nbecome faster and more agile in limiting the spread of \r\nviolence and seizing opportunities to resolve a conflict. \r\nWe need to move away from template-determined \r\napproaches to a more targeted approach with mandates \r\ntailored to specific demands on the ground. We need \r\na shared understanding of the tasks involved so as to \r\nstrengthen coordination between the Security Council \r\nand troop- and police-contributing countries. And we \r\nneed to work hand in hand with national actors and local \r\ncommunities. We also need capabilities, uniformed and \r\ncivilian, that can deploy quickly and operate effectively \r\nin challenging environments. We must ensure \r\nthat administrative procedures are systematically \r\nconfigured to support dynamic field environments. \r\nI thank those Member States that came forward with \r\ntheir commitments of scarce and valuable resources \r\nat the summit on United Nations peacekeeping held \r\non 28 September. That is a significant step forward in \r\nequipping United Nations peace operations for today \r\nand tomorrow.\r\nUnited Nations personnel, civilian and uniformed, \r\nmust always uphold the highest standards of conduct \r\nand be held accountable when they do not do so. It \r\nis shameful that that has not always been the case. \r\nWe must work together to eliminate the scourge of \r\nsexual exploitation and abuse, which tarnishes the \r\nreputation of the United Nations and detracts from the \r\ncontributions of so many brave men and women. We \r\nmust also do everything in our power to enhance the \r\nsafety and security of our personnel. Those courageous \r\nmen and women often work in difficult and dangerous \r\nconditions to help make the world a better place. We \r\nshould do our utmost to keep them safe.\r\nThirdly, we need stronger and more partnerships. \r\nEffective peace operations are those in which \r\nmultiple actors — United Nations bodies, troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries, regional organizations, \r\nhost countries and others — pull together and take \r\n15-30802 5/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nadvantage of each other’s strengths. Each partnership \r\nwill be distinct, thus reflecting the overall strategy and \r\nspecific demands.\r\nIn our partnerships with regional organizations, \r\nwe will aim to prioritize standing arrangements for \r\nearly consultation and rapid response, including \r\nbridging arrangements. The African Union is bearing \r\nan increasingly heavy burden, along with several of \r\nthe continent’s subregional organizations. It is time \r\nto take United Nations-African Union ties to a new \r\nlevel, including through predictable and sustainable \r\nfinancing for African Union peace operations. We must \r\nalso deepen our ties with the European Union and other \r\norganizations that can contribute.\r\nUnited Nations peace operations are an essential \r\ntool, but they are not the only international tool. I \r\nwelcome the ongoing intergovernmental reviews on \r\npeacebuilding and on the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000), on women and peace \r\nand security. My report has drawn on those reviews \r\nand identified the links among them. There is far more \r\nwe can do to sustain peace and help post-conflict \r\nsocieties avoid a relapse into violent conflict. And \r\ndespite important gains in advancing the women and \r\npeace and security agenda, we have still not done \r\nenough to involve women in peace processes and other \r\ndecision-making processes.\r\nThe coming World Humanitarian Summit, to \r\nbe held in Istanbul in May 2016, is a further piece of \r\nthe picture. That will be an opportunity to reinforce \r\nour common endeavour to save lives and prevent and \r\nalleviate suffering. Taken together, those efforts can \r\nenable us to renew the instruments available to the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe do not have many opportunities to reform \r\nUnited Nations peace operations comprehensively. \r\nThe last major effort of that kind was 15 years ago. Yet \r\nwe all understand how much the world has changed \r\nsince that time. It is essential that we act urgently and \r\ncollectively and not wait, as in the past, for crisis or \r\ntragedy to propel reform. I stand ready to work with \r\nMember States in the months ahead.\r\nI thank members for their presence here today. Let \r\nour actions speak louder than our words on behalf of the \r\npeople around the world who look to us for leadership \r\nand support.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement.\r\nMr. Halfaoui (Morocco): I have the honour of \r\ndelivering this statement on behalf of the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries (NAM).\r\nI thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nhis initiative, the Secretary-General for the presentation \r\nof his report (A/70/357) and the Chair of the High-\r\nlevel Independent Panel on Peace Operations and its \r\nmembers for their comprehensive report (see A/70/95).\r\nAs the group representing 90 per cent of the troop-\r\ncontributing countries, the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries has a clear and well-known position on all \r\naspects of peacekeeping, which I will not reiterate at \r\nthis stage. I will focus my intervention on the following \r\npoints.\r\nThe Movement is of the view that both the report of \r\nthe High-level Panel and that of the Secretary-General \r\nshould be studied carefully, as they will enable us to \r\ncover all critical aspects of peace operations.\r\nOn the procedural front, NAM reiterates that the \r\ndevelopment of concepts, policies and strategies should \r\nbe part of an intergovernmental process and that the \r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations is the \r\nsole body in charge of policymaking in peacekeeping. \r\nTherefore, all recommendations relating to peacekeeping \r\nshould be addressed to the Special Committee. In \r\nthat connection, recommendations relating to special \r\npolitical missions should be addressed to the Fourth \r\nCommittee, and those with financial implications \r\nshould be addressed to the Fifth Committee.\r\nTo conclude, I wish to assure the Assembly that \r\nNAM is following the review process closely and \r\nwill engage constructively with the Secretariat and \r\nthe relevant bodies of the United Nations. However, \r\nin order to ensure a successful interaction among all \r\nof the relevant stakeholders, transparency, clarity and \r\ninformation-sharing are essential.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the former \r\nHead of Delegation of the European Union to the United \r\nNations.\r\nMr. Mayr-Harting (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; as well as the Republic of Moldova and \r\nArmenia, align themselves with this statement.\r\n6/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nLet me first thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis report (A/70/357), which gives us a valuable and \r\ncomprehensive picture of the state of play with regard to \r\npeace operations today and the challenges that we need \r\nto address collectively. We are grateful for the work done \r\nby the Secretariat and by the High-Level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations, led by President Ramos-\r\nHorta. It is a pleasure for me to welcome both him and \r\nthe members of his Panel here today. We equally value \r\nthe consultative approach that underpinned the process.\r\nIn adopting the 2030 Agenda on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), the General Assembly \r\nagreed on a development framework that will ultimately \r\ncontribute to global stability. The link between security \r\nand development is unquestionable. We very much \r\nwelcome the inclusion of Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 16, on peaceful societies, in the 2030 Agenda. The \r\nsecurity-development-human rights nexus is critical to \r\nachieving long-lasting stability, and in that sense, the \r\nglobal 2030 Agenda and the global peace and security \r\nagenda cannot be separated.\r\nThe global security environment has changed \r\ndramatically in recent years. The report of the \r\nSecretary-General clearly identifies the challenges \r\nthat need to be tackled. That can be done only in a \r\ntruly global partnership, as the Secretary-General \r\nhas just underlined. We are happy to attest that the \r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations enjoy such a \r\npartnership. We have recently identified joint priority \r\nareas for strengthening the strategic partnership \r\nbetween the United Nations and the European Union on \r\npeacekeeping and crisis management up to 2018.\r\nAt the same time, we are encouraged by the \r\nopportunities provided by the review of the United \r\nNations peace and security architecture. Business as \r\nusual is no longer an option. With the imminent release \r\nof the global study on the implementation of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1325 (2000) and the launch of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture, we now have all the three building \r\nblocks needed for efforts to enhance United Nations \r\neffectiveness in the global security environment. \r\nThe outcome of the ongoing reviews should be bold \r\nin ambition and propose concrete steps to enhance \r\neffectiveness. No one reform should be undertaken in \r\nisolation from the others. The search for coherence, \r\nsynergies and complementarities among those reviews \r\nshould guide our work ahead.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s report on \r\nthe future of United Nations peace operations. Many \r\nof the suggestions of the High-level Independent Panel \r\nhave been picked up and further developed. Key issues \r\nthat the European Union and its member States have \r\nidentified have found a place in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, such as the need for coherence, for linking \r\ndevelopment and security efforts, for making use of the \r\nfull spectrum of responses, for placing the protection \r\nof civilians up front, for mainstreaming gender aspects \r\nthroughout and for better and more clearly defined \r\nmandates and transition arrangements. Allow me to \r\nreflect on some of those aspects.\r\nFirst, we fully support the notion that the full \r\nspectrum of peace operations should be used in a \r\ncontinuum of responses. We encourage all within the \r\nSecretariat to work collaboratively to ensure a coherent \r\nresponse.\r\nSecondly, even the most successful peace operations \r\ncannot be a substitute for political processes. Prevention \r\nand mediation, making full use of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s good offices, the early deployment of United \r\nNations special political missions, United Nations \r\nregional and bilateral peacebuilding and mediation \r\ntools and public diplomacy must become a priority. That \r\nwould show that the global system is intent on reducing \r\narmed conflict. Likewise, consolidating peacebuilding \r\nefforts must be on the agenda throughout, and the \r\npeacebuilding agenda must be fully synchronized with \r\npeacekeeping efforts. Wider peacebuilding activities \r\nmust be given the means to be effective.\r\nThirdly, the protection of civilians and the \r\nprevention of atrocity crimes must be at the core of any \r\npeace operation’s mandate. We welcome the emphasis \r\non a regular assessment of the mission’s political and \r\nprotection effect, the extent to which the mission has \r\nthe capabilities to fulfil its protection mandate and the \r\nadditional political and practical support required.\r\nCrucially, the protected must not be harmed by \r\nthose meant to protect them. We welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s emphasis on increased accountability and his \r\nefforts to strengthen the system’s ability to deal with \r\nsexual exploitation and abuse swiftly and decisively.\r\nLocal ownership is an important factor in \r\nprotecting civilians. We welcome the suggestion for \r\nmission-wide strategies and guidance to engage with \r\nthe local populations. Similarly, corruption should also \r\nbe recognized as a driver of conflict and instability.\r\n15-30802 7/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nFourthly, we are committed to advancing the \r\nwomen and peace and security agenda, both internally \r\nand in relations with third countries. The focus on \r\ngender mainstreaming in mission settings is welcome, \r\nas is the intention to strengthen gender expertise in \r\nmissions.\r\nFifthly, United Nations peace operations need to be \r\nequipped with clear, coherent and achievable mandates \r\nthat include a strong human rights component. Adequate \r\nresources needed for peace operations, including \r\nspecial political missions, should be ensured so that \r\nthey can deliver on their mandated tasks. Operations \r\nshould make the most efficient use of human, political \r\nand financial resources.\r\nWe are keen to understand better the benefits of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal that the dedicated \r\ncapacities for child protection and conflict-related \r\nsexual violence should cease to exist as separate entities \r\nin peace operations and should instead be consolidated \r\nwithin the human rights components of missions. The \r\nEuropean Union attaches great importance to those \r\nspecial protection mandates, and changes in mission \r\nstructures should not curtail missions’ ability to \r\neffectively protect women and children in situations of \r\narmed conflict.\r\nIn the light of the complex and dangerous \r\nenvironments in which such missions are operating, \r\nwe underline the important role of information and \r\nintelligence for delivery on mandates and personnel \r\nprotection. We support efforts by the United Nations to \r\nfurther develop those capacities for current and future \r\nmissions.\r\nFinally, we welcome the reference to reinforcing \r\nglobal-regional partnerships. As stated earlier, our \r\ntwo organizations recently agreed to cooperate more \r\ndeeply on topics of mutual interest, ranging from rapid \r\nresponse to facilitating the contribution of European \r\nUnion member States to United Nations peacekeeping, \r\nsecurity-sector reform, mutual support and enhanced \r\ninformation exchange.\r\nWe also conduct missions and operations in support \r\nof United Nations objectives and United Nations \r\npeacekeeping across the world. Currently, 17 European \r\nUnion crisis missions are deployed, of which 6 are \r\nmilitary and 11 civilian. They allow for burden-sharing \r\nand support for United Nations activities, notably in \r\nMali, the Central African Republic, Somalia and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, as well as in the \r\nBalkans.\r\nWe also remain committed to giving full support \r\nto Africa’s efforts to manage its own security. I would \r\nalso underline that fact in response to the comments \r\nmade by the Secretary-General in his presentation. \r\nThe European Union has agreed to increase funding \r\nfor its African Peace Facility from €750 million to \r\n€900 million for the period 2014-2016.\r\nThe role of regional organizations within United \r\nNations-led interventions could be better defined, \r\nwhether it entails facilitating rapid deployment when \r\nappropriate, acting as a complement to United Nations \r\noperations or being deployed in a bridging capacity \r\ngaps.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating our commitment to \r\na strong global order and to an effective United Nations. \r\nMore than ever, Europe is ready to play its part. Those \r\nwords — “more than ever, Europe is ready to play its \r\npart” — are probably the last words I have the honour \r\nto pronounce in my capacity as Head of Delegation of \r\nthe European Union in the Assembly, and I am very \r\npleased that it was precisely those words.\r\nMr. Koroma (Sierra Leone): Let me by thanking \r\nyou, Mr. President, for giving me the f loor to make a \r\nstatement on behalf of the Group of African States.\r\nThe African Group holds in high regard the report of \r\nthe High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations \r\n(see A/70/95). That is understandable, given the fact \r\nthat a high proportion of United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations are concentrated in Africa. It is for that \r\nreason that Africa has taken the High-level Panel’s \r\nwork very seriously. We acknowledge the great length \r\nto which the Panel went to consult with Member States, \r\nregional and subregional bodies and other stakeholders. \r\nThe common African position on the United Nations \r\nreview of peace operations was adopted by the Peace \r\nand Security Council of the African Union at its five \r\nhundred and second meeting, held on 29 April, in which \r\nAfrica as a region articulated its position regarding the \r\nwork of the Panel.\r\nHaving reviewed the High-level Panel’s report, we \r\nwish to underscore that it provides a comprehensive \r\napproach to strategic and operational aspects of peace \r\noperations. In that respect, we welcome the four \r\nstrategic shifts identified in the report that would be \r\nrequired so as to enable the international community to \r\n8/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nsuccessfully adapt to the changing nature of conflict, \r\nnamely, the need for a political approach, the need to \r\nview peace operations as encompassing a continuum of \r\noptions ranging from the appointment of special envoys \r\nto the deployment of peacekeeping operations, the need \r\nto forge partnerships with regional organizations in \r\norder to exploit fully the comparative advantages of \r\neach organization, and the need to adopt a field-focused \r\nand people-centred approach.\r\nWe wish to express our deepest appreciation to the \r\nHigh-level Panel for taking into account many of the \r\nviews expressed in the African common position, as \r\ntransmitted to the United Nations for the consideration \r\nof the Panel in the preparation of its report.\r\nWe wish in particular to emphasize, first \r\nof all, that the core principles of peacekeeping \r\noperations — consent, impartiality and the limited use \r\nof force — remain relevant but need to be interpreted \r\nwith f lexibility in the face of the new, emerging \r\nchallenges to peacekeeping.\r\nSecondly, conflict prevention and mediation should \r\nbe given paramount importance; hence the primacy of \r\npolitical solutions.\r\nThirdly, partnerships with regional and subregional \r\norganizations are key to operating in future in order to \r\nbe able to address some of the constraints facing the \r\nUnited Nations. The legislative basis for partnership lies \r\nin Chapter VIII of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nFourthly, the strategic partnership that has been \r\nforged with the African Union should be identified as \r\na template for the relations of the United Nations with \r\nregional organizations generally.\r\nAnd, fifthly, in the light of the slow deployment \r\nof forces into the field, the United Nations should bear \r\nin mind the capacities being developed by the African \r\nUnion to speed up the deployment of peacekeeping \r\noperations.\r\nWe wish to express support for the principles that \r\nshould underpin that partnership, namely, consultative \r\ndecision-making, a division of labour based on \r\nrespective comparative advantages, joint analysis, \r\nplanning, monitoring and evaluation, an integrated \r\nresponse to the full conflict-cycle, including prevention \r\nand transparency, accountability and respect for \r\ninternational standards, in consonance with the \r\nprinciples endorsed in the African common position \r\nand other documents relating to the partnership between \r\nthe United Nations and the African Union.\r\nWe express our particular appreciation to the \r\nHigh-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations for \r\nits resuscitation of the recommendations of the Prodi \r\nreport (see A/63/666), entitled “Report of the African \r\nUnion on the African Union-United Nations panel on \r\nmodalities for support to African Union operations”, \r\nwith regard to the founding of the Security Council-\r\nauthorized African Union-led peace support operations.\r\nWe acknowledge that the recommendation made \r\nby the High-level Panel for the use of United Nations \r\nassessed contributions on a case-by-case basis, \r\nincluding the costs associated with the deployment \r\nof uniformed personnel, marks a significant step. We \r\ntherefore urge that that proposal be endorsed by the \r\nUnited Nations decision-making organs, and we hold \r\nourselves ready to follow up on that recommendation \r\nwith the relevant organs, committees and interested \r\nparties within the United Nations.\r\nWe also take note of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “The future of United Nations peace \r\noperations: implementation of the recommendations \r\nof the High-level Independent Panel on Peace \r\nOperations” (A/70/357). We are willing to engage with \r\nthe Secretariat on how to implement the important \r\nrecommendations made by the High-level Panel, \r\nincluding the lessons learned in the transitions from \r\nAfrican Union peacekeeping operations to United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in the Central African \r\nRepublic and Mali.\r\nWe take particular note of the following \r\nrecommendations. First, there is the conduct of the \r\nlessons-learned exercise aimed at reviewing and \r\nassessing the various mechanisms available to improve \r\nthe predictability, sustainability and f lexibility of the \r\nfinancing for African Union peacekeeping operations, \r\nauthorized by the Security Council. Secondly, there is \r\nthe joint identification of context-specific benchmarks \r\nthat could be used to determine the conditions under \r\nwhich a transition should take place, given the needs \r\nin the country and the situation on the ground. Thirdly, \r\nthere is the development of a creative and f lexible \r\ntransition tool box, embodying a common vision that \r\nthe African Union and the United Nations would \r\nemploy, when and where appropriate, to inform future \r\ntransition processes.\r\n15-30802 9/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nWe once again express appreciation to the \r\nSecretary-General for his wisdom in establishing such \r\na high-profile panel with the requisite mandate.\r\nMs. Bird (Australia): I have the honour to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of the group of countries made \r\nup of Canada, Australia, and New Zealand (CANZ).\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his candid \r\nassessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the \r\nUnited Nations peace operations architecture. Let \r\nme also acknowledge today the presence of President \r\nRamos-Horta, Ms. Ameerah Haq and other members \r\nof the High-level Independent Panel on Peacekeeping \r\nOperations, and to thank them for their excellent work.\r\nAs the peace operations review report (see A/70/95) \r\nmakes clear, the nature of global conflict has changed. \r\nUnited Nations peace operations are operating in \r\nincreasingly difficult environments and must adapt \r\nto meet those new challenges, with the protection of \r\ncivilians remaining the core priority. The CANZ group \r\nagrees with the Secretary-General’s assertion that \r\npolitical solutions must be paramount in the design \r\nof peace operations. Comprehensive approaches that \r\nutilize all of the United Nations conflict prevention and \r\nresolution tools are needed if political solutions and \r\nsustainable peace are to be achieved. The recent leaders \r\nsummit on peacekeeping has provided much-needed \r\nfocus on, and new commitments aimed at, the enhanced \r\ncapability of United Nations peace operations.\r\nThe CANZ group strongly supports the initiatives \r\nwithin the Secretariat, outlined by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral today, to tangibly improve the performance \r\nof United Nations peace operations. The CANZ \r\ngroup supports improved strategic force generation \r\nand capability development, better operational and \r\nstrategic planning, enhanced safety and security \r\nassessment and management tools, strengthened United \r\nNations policing and the use of new technologies for \r\neffective mandate implementation. The CANZ group \r\nencourages the Secretariat to continue its efforts to \r\nimprove contingent training and performance through \r\nmeasurable, effects-based and performance-focused \r\nmeasures.\r\nConsistent with the High-level Panel’s report, \r\nwe also support improved systems, approaches and \r\nstructures in the Secretariat with a view to becoming \r\nmore field-oriented in its peace operations preparation \r\nand supporting better operability in the field. We \r\nbelieve that involving women in peace operations \r\ngreatly contributes to missions’ performance and \r\nsuccess. Accordingly, we strongly support the \r\nongoing efforts to promote women’s participation \r\nin peace and security, in particular participating \r\nin the brokering of ceasefires, peace negotiations, \r\nconflict resolution and monitoring of peace. Women’s \r\nparticipation must be central to all processes, not just \r\non women’s issues. Operational effectiveness will be \r\nenhanced through the implementation of the review’s \r\nrecommendations, such as the call to conduct gender-\r\nsensitive analysis throughout the mission-planning, \r\nmandate-development, implementation, review and \r\nmission-drawdown processes. The CANZ group also \r\nencourages the Secretariat to continue to forge ahead \r\nwith its implementation of a robust, transparent and \r\naccountable zero-tolerance policy on sexual exploitation \r\nand abuse.\r\nMember States are key to the effective \r\nimplementation of the review’s recommendations. \r\nTo that end, we must all engage constructively in \r\nUnited Nations negotiating forums to make that a \r\nreality, including in the Fourth Committee and the \r\nFifth Committee negotiations and within the Security \r\nCouncil Working Group on Peacekeeping Operations. \r\nAs others have mentioned, the parallel reviews of the \r\nUnited Nations peace operations, the peacebuilding \r\narchitecture and Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) \r\nprovide an opportunity for broader and transformative \r\nchange in the United Nations engagement in fragile \r\nand conflict-affected States. The CANZ group urges a \r\ncoherent and the holistic approach to implementing the \r\nreviews and initiatives already under way, as outlined \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report (A/70/357) on the \r\npeace operations review, and we look forward to the \r\nhigh-level thematic debate that will be convened by the \r\nPresident in May.\r\nWe all provided substantial support over the course \r\nof the peace operations review. It will now be important \r\nfor Member States to collectively reach an early and \r\nclear understanding of what we wish to achieve. More \r\nthan ever, we must ensure that our work reflects a \r\nrealistic and contemporary understanding of United \r\nNations peace operations and of the ever-evolving \r\nchallenges faced in the field to help those who need us \r\nmost.\r\nMr. Kandeel (Egypt): Egypt aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representative of Morocco \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, and by the \r\n10/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nrepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the African \r\nGroup.\r\nWe thank the President for conducting this \r\nimportant debate on the report of the Secretary-General \r\non the future of peace operations (A/70/357). We thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his initiative in setting up the \r\nHigh-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, and \r\nwe take note of the Panel’s report (see A/70/95) and its \r\nrecommendations. We believe that this is an opportunity \r\nto develop a common understanding of peacekeeping \r\nand create an effective coordination mechanism among \r\nthe main stakeholders in peacekeeping, including \r\nregional actors and troop-contributing countries. As \r\nwe deliberate on the future of peacekeeping, let me \r\nhighlight the following points.\r\nFirst, it is crucial to re-emphasize the three main \r\npillars of peacekeeping, namely, consent, impartiality \r\nand limiting the use of force. Secondly, peacekeeping \r\nshould ordinarily follow the signing of a peace \r\nagreement. Peacekeeping forces are not universal armed \r\nforces that are entitled to impose peace agreements on \r\nparties to the conflict. Thirdly, it is crucial to ensure \r\nthe robust nature of peacekeeping operations so as to \r\nensure sufficient deterrence and achieve the necessary \r\nlevel of protection of civilians.\r\nThe lessons of history have taught us that \r\npeacekeeping, and the use of force for that matter, \r\ncannot on their own achieve everlasting peace. The \r\ninternational community needs a holistic approach to \r\ntackling threats to international peace and security. \r\nTherefore, peacekeeping efforts should be closely \r\ncoordinated with other peace missions, starting with \r\nthe necessary efforts prior to peacekeeping, such as \r\nprevention, mediation and conflict management, all the \r\nway to post-conflict efforts to sustain peace, including \r\npeacebuilding, State-building and tackling the root \r\ncauses of conflict. It is also necessary to consider any \r\npossible nexus between peacekeeping operations and \r\nsanctions regimes.\r\nIt is important, however, to distinguish between \r\nprevention and premature intervention. Our discussions \r\nshould draw the fine line between them. While \r\nprevention efforts are recommended at an early stage, \r\nforeign intervention could, in many instances, be \r\npremature and sometimes worsen the situation rather \r\nthan resolve it, especially when some parties to the \r\nconflict use international attention and pressure to \r\nreach political goals.\r\nWe commend efforts to establish global regional \r\npartnerships for peacekeeping. It is important to \r\nrecognize regional peacekeepers as the first responders \r\nwhen conflicts erupt in the region. It is therefore \r\nimperative to establish concrete mechanisms for \r\ncooperation between the Security Council and regional \r\nand subregional actors on peacekeeping. We look \r\nforward to a thorough discussion in the relevant General \r\nAssembly committees on the implementation report \r\nof the Secretary-General, which should be a starting \r\npoint for further developing ideas to strengthen United \r\nNations peacekeeping efforts.\r\nMs. Coleman (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiative to reform the United Nations peace operations. \r\nThat effort comes at a critical time, with over 125,000 \r\npersonnel deployed and 27 peacekeeping, political \r\nand peacebuilding missions. United Nations peace \r\noperations remain an indispensable tool for preventing \r\nand responding to conflict.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAs we know, peacekeeping operations and the \r\nessential prevention and peacebuilding work performed \r\nby special political missions face immense challenges \r\ntoday. They are deployed in increasingly dangerous \r\nenvironments, as demonstrated most starkly by the \r\nnumber of casualties among peacekeepers in Mali. \r\nThey are performing diverse mandates and complex \r\noperations, such as protecting civilians in the midst of \r\nSouth Sudan’s civil war, supporting Liberia during the \r\nEbola crisis and assisting Haitians after the earthquake. \r\nAmid those challenges, the United Nations systems, \r\npolicies and procedures are again straining to keep \r\npace.\r\nWe welcomed the widely consultative process of the \r\nHigh-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and \r\nits efforts to complement parallel reviews on the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture and on women and \r\npeace and security, as well as its inclusion of strategic \r\nas well as tactical-level recommendations. Building on \r\nthe High-level Panel’s recommendations, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s implementation report (A/70/357) identifies \r\nproposals to address long-standing, chronic challenges \r\nfacing peace operations, including a renewed focus \r\non prevention and mediation, stronger regional-global \r\npartnerships and new ways of planning and conducting \r\nUnited Nations peace operations. Let me briefly \r\nhighlight three priorities for the United States:\r\n15-30802 11/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nFirst, on the protection of civilians, we welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s emphasis on the need for United \r\nNations peace operations to protect civilians, one of the \r\nmission leadership’s critical responsibilities. Essential \r\nto that are mission-wide strategies to assess civilian \r\ninsecurity and to make use of all available tools, from \r\nmediation and non-military means to the use of force, \r\nwhere appropriate and necessary, to support protection. \r\nIn addition, we welcome the establishment of an \r\nassessment and planning cell in the Executive Office \r\nof the Secretary-General, and we urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to ensure that strategic assessments and \r\nplanning incorporate protection and atrocity risks in an \r\neffective and systematic way.\r\nSecondly, on empowering missions in the field, \r\nadministrative and financial policies and procedures \r\nmust be configured to support dynamic field \r\nenvironments. That will require a change of culture, \r\npolicies and approaches, including aligning authorities \r\nwith responsibilities and empowering missions, while \r\nensuring accountability. That includes enabling \r\nmissions to recruit and rapidly deploy the right \r\nexpertise at the right time, giving force commanders \r\nmore control over medical and casualty capabilities and \r\nensuring that planning is aligned with capacities.\r\nThirdly, on preventing and addressing sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse, which is the collective \r\nresponsibility of the United Nations and all its Member \r\nStates, we welcome the Secretary-General’s recent \r\ninitiatives to combat such behaviour. We urge him to \r\ncontinue his efforts on sexual exploitation and abuse \r\nprevention, while enforcing the zero-tolerance policy, \r\ntransparency, accountability and remedial measures.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s implementation report \r\nfocuses on reforms that can be implemented over the \r\ncoming 12 months. Some of the reforms he sets out \r\nhave already received prior authorization from the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Others will require Member States’ \r\napproval, and still others call upon the membership \r\nto act. In that regard, I would ask that the General \r\nAssembly consider early action to acknowledge the \r\nSecretary-General’s initiative before consideration in \r\nthe relevant bodies.\r\nThe United States stands ready to work with the \r\nSecretary-General and Member States to ensure that the \r\nmomentum generated by the High-level Independent \r\nPanel’s review is not lost. As the Assembly knows, \r\nand as President Obama said at the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping summit on 28 September,\r\n“We know that peace operations are not the solution \r\nto every problem, but they do remain one of the \r\nworld’s most important tools to address armed \r\nconflict.”\r\nFor peace operations to remain an effective and efficient \r\nmeans of addressing threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity, we must seize this opportunity together.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): I wish to thank the President \r\nof the General Assembly for organizing this plenary \r\nmeeting on the report of the Secretary-General entitled \r\n“The future of United Nations peace operations: \r\nimplementation of recommendations of the High-level \r\nIndependent Panel on Peace Operations” (A/70/357). \r\nIt is significant that this meeting has been organized \r\nby the President among the first agenda items on the \r\nimportant issue of United Nations peace operations.\r\nWe align our statement with that made by the \r\nrepresentative of Morocco on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement earlier today.\r\nMy delegation’s views on today’s topic are based \r\non our experience in both the peacekeeping and the \r\npeacebuilding operations of the United Nations. India \r\nis the largest cumulative troop contributor to United \r\nNations peace operations, with over 185,000 troops \r\nhaving served in 48 of the 69 missions mandated so far. \r\nThe recommendations of the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations, appointed by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in October 2014, carry great importance for \r\nus. We have expressed our satisfaction with the report \r\n(see A/70/95) earlier and warmly welcome the presence \r\nhere today of the High-level Panel’s Chair, Mr. Ramos-\r\nHorta, and the Vice-Chair, Ms. Ameerah Haq.\r\nThe most important issue — the elephant in the \r\nroom — is the big picture, namely, the way in which \r\nmandates for peace operations are formulated by the \r\nSecurity Council. We are dismayed at the opaque \r\nmanner in which the Council continues to mandate peace \r\noperations without any accountability or transparency. \r\nThe human costs of that failing are evident in both \r\nthe rising number of casualties among United Nations \r\npeacekeepers and the alarming growth in the number of \r\ncivilians — now reaching, according to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, 60 million — whose lives are being disrupted \r\nby conflicts that an ineffective Security Council is \r\npowerless to resolve. As a declared advocate of human \r\nrights, we believe that the President of the General \r\nAssembly must take the lead to prioritize agreement on \r\nan early reform of the Council during the seventieth \r\n12/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nsession of the General Assembly in order to bring hope \r\nto millions of ordinary men, women and children.\r\nThe Secretary-General has proposed three pillars \r\nfor conducting United Nations peace operations. Of \r\nthem, primacy must be given to the pacific settlement \r\nof disputes as the core objective of United Nations \r\npeace operations, as set out in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which will enable every peace operation to \r\nhave a clear implementation time frame. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral has recommended that sustained dialogue \r\namong the Council, the Secretariat and troop and police \r\ncontributors is essential for shared understanding of \r\nappropriate responses and their implications for the \r\nmandate and conduct of a peace operation. He has \r\nfurther stated that such a dialogue should begin before \r\na mission is established, something that we strongly \r\nsupport.\r\nThe Secretary-General, in his report, and the \r\nHigh-level Panel have rightly recognized that United \r\nNations peace operations are not designed or equipped \r\nto impose political solutions through the sustained use \r\nof force, and that United Nations peace operations are \r\nnot an appropriate tool for military counter-terrorism \r\noperations. We endorse that view, since United \r\nNations peacekeepers are not deployable for targeted \r\noffensive action against armed militias, non-State \r\nactors or terrorists. We should not abandon the cardinal \r\nprinciples of United Nations peacekeeping, which have \r\nwithstood the test of time, namely, the consent of the \r\nparties, impartiality and the non-use of force except \r\nin self-defence and defence of the mandate. We urge \r\nthat the current allocation of resources within United \r\nNations peace operations be reviewed with the aim of \r\nsupporting political efforts to bring about a peaceful \r\nsettlement of conflicts, which would considerably \r\nmitigate the growing resource constraints facing United \r\nNations peace operations.\r\nThe Secretary-General has reaffirmed his \r\ncommitment to informing and briefing the Security \r\nCouncil about situations where there is an escalating \r\nrisk for civilians or a serious shortfall in a mission’s \r\nability to fulfil its protection mandate. That is a welcome \r\nstep. As a troop-contributing country, we look forward \r\nto participating in such briefings in an interactive \r\nmanner. United Nations peacekeepers are not only the \r\nOrganization’s boots on the ground, they are its eyes \r\nand ears, and by interacting directly with Member \r\nStates, the Security Council can only benefit from the \r\nground-level assessments that the troop-contributing \r\ncountries can provide. Such interaction will contribute \r\nto more effective implementation of the mandate for the \r\nprotection of civilians. That is why we are calling for \r\nArticle 44 of the Charter to be implemented in letter \r\nand spirit.\r\nThe Secretary-General has reported that sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse by a small minority of United \r\nNations personnel continue to shame our Organization. \r\nSuch abuse scars the lives of men, women and children, \r\nand we take such cases extremely seriously. The United \r\nNations must apply one standard, that of zero tolerance, \r\nwhen dealing with all cases of sexual exploitation and \r\nabuse in its field operations, whether peacekeeping, \r\npeacebuilding or others.\r\nWe request that all issues referred to in our \r\ndebate today be referred to the Special Committee on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations for consideration along with \r\nthe High-level Panel’s report.\r\nDuring the recently concluded leaders’ summit \r\nheld in New York on 28 September, the Prime Minister \r\nof India announced a 10 per cent increase in our \r\ntroop contributions to existing and new operations, \r\nwhich is already more than 8,000; an additional three \r\npolice units, with a higher representation of female \r\npeacekeepers, and a commitment to providing critical \r\nenablers, deploying technical personnel in United \r\nNations missions and providing additional training for \r\npeacekeepers, both at our facilities in India and in the \r\nfield. Such commitments show that India is willing \r\nto walk the walk when it comes to supporting United \r\nNations peace operations.\r\nMr. Wang Min (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nwould like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nbriefing.\r\nPeace is a shared aspiration and noble goal of all \r\nhumankind. United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nwere born of the desire for peace, and they continue \r\nto exist for the same reason. Sixty-seven years have \r\npassed since the first United Nations operation was \r\nestablished. Such operations have brought about peace in \r\nregions of conflict, and hope for the people living there. \r\nPeacekeeping operations were an innovative aspect of \r\nmultilateralism for the international community and \r\nhave become an important way of maintaining peace \r\nand security around the world.\r\nToday, people continue to suffer severe hardships \r\nas a result of conflicts and wars in many parts of the \r\nworld, and their desire for peace and their hopes and \r\n15-30802 13/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nexpectations of the United Nations and its peacekeeping \r\noperations are all the more anxious and intense. At the \r\nsame time, issues such as the threat of terrorism, the \r\nexpansion of peacekeeping operations’ mandates and \r\nthe absence, in some cases, of a peace to maintain are \r\nposing new challenges for peacekeeping operations. \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations must innovate \r\nif they are to evolve.\r\nChina supports the Secretary-General’s initiative in \r\nlaunching a review of the Organization’s peacekeeping \r\noperations and his report (A/70/357) based on the \r\nrecommendations of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations (see A/70/95). It is China’s hope \r\nthat the review will enable us to further improve the \r\nphilosophy behind peacekeeping operations, optimize \r\ntheir mandates, strengthen their capacity-building and \r\nenhance their efficiency. In that regard, I would like to \r\nstress the following four points.\r\nFirst, the basic principles for peacekeeping \r\noperations should be observed. Peacekeeping \r\noperations should abide by the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the principles \r\nespoused by Dag Hammarskjöld. They should respect \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of the countries \r\nconcerned, have due respect for their leadership and \r\ntake great care where the use of forceful measures is \r\nconcerned. The Security Council should be realistic \r\nand avoid overreaching, make clear the priorities and \r\nfocus at various stages of peacekeeping missions, \r\nand adjust the mandates and scale of peacekeeping \r\noperations according to the realities on the ground. In \r\nimplementing Security Council resolutions, operations \r\nshould not exceed their mandates and should formulate \r\nand implement exit have withdrawal strategies in a \r\ntimely fashion based on local circumstances and needs.\r\nSecondly, the peacekeeping operations system \r\nshould continually be improved; it should be connected \r\nvertically to the processes of preventive diplomacy \r\nand peacebuilding and horizontally to the exercise of \r\npolitical good offices and the institution of the rule of \r\nlaw, national reconciliation processes. and improvement \r\nof people’s lives. The Council should hear the views \r\nof the countries concerned and troop-contributing \r\ncountries more often, and should be better coordinated \r\nwith regional organizations and take the best possible \r\nadvantage of the assistance of the World Bank, the \r\nAfrican Development Bank and other relevant financial \r\ninstitutions in order to create synergies.\r\nThirdly, we should increase the rapid-response \r\ncapabilities of operations, shorten the deployment \r\ncycle and speed up the rate of deployment, which \r\nmay improve operations’ image and credibility, with \r\na view to improving the efficiency and effectiveness \r\nof the implementation of Security Council provisions. \r\nConsiderable efforts should be made to improve the \r\nprocess of establishing and deploying peacekeeping \r\nand special political missions and optimize logistics-\r\nsupport systems in order to ensure a force’s timely \r\ndeployment, as well as the transfer of the necessary \r\nresources so as to avoid waste. We should improve \r\npeacekeepers’ discipline. China welcomes the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations to establish the new Peacekeeping \r\nCapabilities Readiness System, and we call on other \r\nMember States to participate in it.\r\nFourthly, we should give greater support to Africa, \r\nwhere more than half of United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations are deployed. The Organization should give \r\ngreater attention to the important role that regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, such as the African Union, \r\nplay in the maintenance of peace and security in Africa. \r\nThe United Nations and international community \r\nshould strengthen their coordination and cooperation in \r\npeacekeeping with regional organizations in Africa, and \r\nhelp Africa build its peacekeeping capacity. We should \r\ngive full play to the strengths of regional organizations, \r\nsuch as the African Union, in peacekeeping operations \r\nand help Africans solve African issues in African ways.\r\nAs one of the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil and the world’s largest developing country, \r\nChina has always provided appropriate support to \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and has duly \r\ncontributed to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Last month, when President Xi Jinping \r\nattended the United Nations summit on peacekeeping \r\noperations, he made six commitments aimed at \r\nsupporting and enhancing United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations.\r\nFirst, China will participate in the new United \r\nNations peacekeeping standby mechanism and, in \r\naddition to a regular peacekeeping police force, will \r\nbuild an 8,000-strong standby peacekeeping force. \r\nSecondly, at the request of the United Nations, China \r\nwill favourably consider sending more engineers, \r\nas well as transport and medical personnel, to \r\npeacekeeping operations. Thirdly, during the next five \r\nyears, China will train 2,000 peacekeepers for other \r\ncountries and will engage in 10 de-mining assistance \r\n14/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nprojects, including through the provision of training \r\nand equipment. Fourthly, over the next five years, \r\nChina will provide $100 million in cost-free military \r\nassistance to the African Union to support the building \r\nof regular forces and rapid-response crisis forces in \r\nAfrica. Fifthly, China will deploy its first helicopter \r\ncontingent to a peacekeeping mission in Africa. \r\nSixthly, part of the China-United Nations Peacekeeping \r\nDevelopment Fund will be earmarked for United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations have become an important \r\nmeans of maintaining peace and security at the global \r\nlevel. They must be strengthened, not weakened.\r\nChina will make every effort to implement the \r\nsix commitments made by President Xi Jinping. We \r\nare ready to work unremittingly with the Secretariat, \r\nthe countries concerned, the troop contributors, the \r\nAfrican Union and the other stakeholders to make a \r\ngreater contribution to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nMr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): The \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania aligns itself with the \r\nstatements made on behalf of the African Group and \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe also join in welcoming the report (A/70/357) \r\nof the Secretary-General on the future of peacekeeping \r\noperations based on the recommendations of the High-\r\nlevel Independent Panel on Peace Operations, led by \r\nformer President José Ramos-Horta. As noted by \r\nthe African Group, the issues raised in both reports \r\nshould be accorded ample space for discussion in the \r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and in \r\nthe Fourth and Fifth Committees. We shall state our \r\npositions further in the deliberations of those bodies.\r\nIn the meantime, it is beyond doubt that the demands \r\nfor fulfilling the promise and vision of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, namely, to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, are proving more \r\nchallenging today than at any other time in the history of \r\nthe Organization. It is therefore not surprising that the \r\nlimitations of the Organization’s global engagements \r\nare increasingly reflected in its peace operations. \r\nThose limitations or shortcomings are not attributable \r\nsolely to the Organization. As Member States, we bear \r\nthe larger responsibility. Consequently, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s call for an urgent change in the way peace \r\nand security instruments are conceived and applied to \r\nmaximize impact is an appeal that should be heeded \r\nwith the urgency it deserves.\r\nWe support the primacy of politics over military and \r\ntechnical engagements. We have underscored on several \r\noccasions, including in our statement (see A/70/PV.17) in \r\nthe recent general debate of the Assembly, the essential \r\nrole of increased investment in conflict prevention. \r\nWe therefore agree with the Secretary-General and the \r\nPanel on the importance of early engagement by the \r\nSecurity Council, of supporting national and regional \r\nprevention and mediation efforts and of bolstering the \r\nSecretariat’s prevention and mediation capabilities.\r\nThe three core pillars that the Secretary-General \r\nproposes in his action plan — focusing on prevention and \r\nmediation, strengthening regional/global partnerships \r\nand devising new ways of planning and conducting \r\npeace operations to make them faster, more responsive \r\nand more accountable to the needs of countries and \r\npeople in conflicts — require priority attention. We \r\nview those three pillars as the main supports of a \r\nframework that corresponds to Africa’s peacebuilding \r\nlandscape, which has undergone a dramatic evolution \r\nin terms of conflict dynamics and the emergence of \r\nnew conflict actors.\r\nIt is often pointed out that Africa has served \r\nas the laboratory for many of the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding initiatives since the end of the Cold \r\nWar. That also holds true with respect to the post-2005 \r\npeacebuilding architecture, which has increasingly \r\nfocused on State-building and technocratic capacity-\r\nbuilding in post-conflict situations. In addition, the \r\nfocus on holding so-called democratic elections, \r\nwithout addressing the root causes of conflicts, is not \r\nconducive to successful undertakings. The lack of \r\nresources and political will for long-term peacebuilding \r\nhave also undermined its sustainability. Better and \r\nmore innovative ways of tackling those challenges need \r\nto be developed and supported.\r\nWe must also be modest enough to concede that, in \r\ncertain circumstances, there are limits to what can be \r\nachieved by foreign intervention and global institutions, \r\ndespite their best intentions. In that regard, the African \r\nUnion (AU) is striving to become a more prominent \r\nactor in the crises that aff lict the continent. We believe \r\nthat there are situations where regional and subregional \r\ninstitutions may prove to be the best first responders. \r\nCredible partnerships with such institutions and actors \r\nmust be central to our common effort.\r\nThat is the essence of the appeal launched by \r\nthe African Union Peace and Security Council at \r\nits high-level meeting held at the United Nations on \r\n15-30802 15/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\n26 September. In welcoming the Panel’s report (see \r\nA/70/95), the meeting reaffirmed the importance of \r\nstrengthening the relationship between the United \r\nNations and regional and subregional organizations \r\nin the context of Chapter VIII of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. We are encouraged that that constitutes \r\na vital component of the Secretary-General’s plan of \r\naction. We also welcome the Secretary-General’s intent \r\nto carry out, jointly with the AU and in consultation \r\nwith other partners, a review and assessment of the \r\nvarious mechanisms currently available for financing \r\nand supporting the AU peace operations authorized by \r\nthe Council. We are confident that the outcome of the \r\nreview will bridge one of the critical gaps that the AU \r\nhas often brought to our collective attention.\r\nWe note with great concern that peacekeepers \r\nare operating in hostile environments with little or no \r\npeace to keep. Attacks against peacekeepers and other \r\nUnited Nations personnel in the field are perpetrated by \r\nnefarious elements that perceive them as an obstacle to \r\ntheir objectives. We must ensure the safety and security \r\nof United Nations personnel. We welcome the proposals \r\nput forward by the Secretary-General in that regard. \r\nWhile strengthening United Nations peace operations, \r\nwe must also endeavour to ensure that peacekeepers are \r\nheld accountable for their misdeeds. We must not allow \r\nthe transgressions of a few to sully the reputation of the \r\nOrganization and the courageous work of many other \r\nvaliant peacekeepers.\r\nFinally, as a country with several contingents in \r\nthe field, we wish to recognize the valuable work being \r\ndone by the Secretary-General and the Secretariat, \r\nespecially through the Department of Field Support \r\nand the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. \r\nTheir work and timely responses have been a source of \r\nvaluable operational support and backstopping for our \r\nforces.\r\nWe are therefore delighted to note the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s directive to undertake a comprehensive \r\nreview of issues related to in-mission mobility, as well \r\nas command and control of military-enabling assets, by \r\nthe spring of 2016. We strongly encourage actions to \r\nensure greater effective performance in the field.\r\nMr. Pedersen (Norway): This important debate \r\nis timely, as it is taking place just after the high-level \r\nweek, during which a main theme was the proliferation \r\nof violent conflicts and their grave humanitarian \r\nconsequences.\r\nA clear message that came from our leaders at the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the Organization is that a \r\nstrong United Nations is more vital than ever in tackling \r\ncritical global challenges to international peace and \r\nsecurity. The diverse range of United Nations peace \r\noperations has become an essential means of upholding \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. As we speak, United \r\nNations peacekeepers are in stronger demand than \r\never before, and they operate in increasingly hostile \r\nenvironments. Millions of people count on them to \r\nprovide a minimum of protection and stability and to \r\nlay the foundations for a better life.\r\nIn addition to the uniformed peacekeepers, \r\nthe United Nations has developed a whole range \r\nof tools for conflict prevention, mediation support \r\nand peacebuilding that have become indispensable. \r\nHowever, as important as those instruments are, they \r\nhave proved incomplete and unable to meet the growing \r\nneeds in ever more complex situations on the ground. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s initiative last year to launch a \r\nprocess to reform United Nations peace operations was \r\ntherefore timely and important, and Norway has been \r\na strong supporter of the initiative from the very start.\r\nThe High-level Independent Panel on Peace \r\nOperations, under the able leadership of Mr. Ramos-\r\nHorta — and let me also pay a compliment to the other \r\nmembers of the Panel here — has been widely praised \r\nfor its consultative approach. The Panel travelled \r\nextensively and received input from Governments, \r\nregional organizations, think tanks and civil society \r\nfrom all regions of the world. Through that inclusive \r\nprocess, it has vastly increased our collective \r\nunderstanding of the challenges confronting United \r\nNations peace operations.\r\nThere seems to be broad consensus on the urgency \r\nof reform, adequately summed up as the four essential \r\nshifts: first, the need for a political strategy in all \r\nmissions; secondly, the need for more responsive and \r\ntailored operations; thirdly, the need for stronger \r\npartnerships; and, fourthly, the need to make United \r\nNations peace operations more field-focused and \r\npeople-centred. The strong commitments to United \r\nNations peacekeeping demonstrated during the recent \r\nsummit on United Nations peacekeeping is also a sign \r\nof that political momentum. That is good news as we \r\nnow move forward to implementation.\r\nThe Panel’s report (see A/70/95) and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/70/357) together represent a \r\n16/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nunique opportunity. We now need to discuss them in \r\ndetail and to act on the proposals. The two reports are \r\ncomplementary: together they constitute a whole. Their \r\nrelationship is explained in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport, which focuses on reforms that can be enacted \r\nover the short term. Other proposals require a longer-\r\nterm perspective. Both are equally important. Together \r\nthe reports give us the best opportunity in a long time \r\nto implement necessary changes. We are responsible \r\nfor making the United Nations peace operations fit for \r\npurpose for the coming decades. The General Assembly \r\nand its committees have a crucial role to play. We agree \r\nthat the time has now come to establish a clear procedure \r\nand a road map for the follow-up phase in the General \r\nAssembly, and our support can be counted on as we \r\nmove ahead under the leadership of the presidency.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): Brazil has a \r\nlong history in peacekeeping operations. Since 1948, \r\nwe have participated in more than 50 United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions through the deployment of \r\ntroops, police and military experts and have provided \r\nmore than 46,000 Blue Helmets in four continents. Our \r\nexperience has shown us first-hand the value of United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations as one of the main \r\ninstruments available to the international community \r\nto address threats to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nBrazil welcomed the intiative by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to appoint a High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeace Operations to conduct a comprehensive review \r\nof the peacekeeping operations and special political \r\nmissions. I take this opportunity to commend the Panel \r\nand its Chair, Mr. Ramos-Horta, for their serious work.\r\nThere is no doubt that nowadays peacekeeping \r\noperations are more complex than they were when the \r\nfirst missions were established by the Organization. \r\nThe Security Council is resorting to peacekeeping \r\nin ever more volatile environments, while conferring \r\nincreasingly ambitious mandates. Against that \r\nbackground, we must learn from the past and build on \r\npositive experiences.\r\nWe welcome the strong emphasis placed by the \r\nPanel on the primacy of politics and on preventive \r\ndiplomacy, as they are approaches that Brazil has long \r\nsupported. Those recommendations must be translated \r\ninto concrete strategies. We also congratulate the \r\nPanel on addressing crucial funding issues. The \r\nestablishment of a special account for special political \r\nmissions separate from the regular budget would boost \r\nefficiency and alleviate budgetary pressures on other \r\ncritical activities financed under the regular budget, \r\nsuch as development and human rights. However, we \r\nare concerned about the f lexible interpretation given \r\nto the basic principles of peacekeeping operations, \r\nas paragraph 9 of the Secretary-General’s report \r\nseems to imply. It is true that innovative solutions are \r\nrequired to cope with the challenges of contemporary \r\nconflicts, but they cannot come at the expense of the \r\nfundamental principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and underpinning United Nations \r\npeacekeeping practice.\r\nThe United Nations should not deviate from its \r\ncentral goal, which is to promote peace and development \r\nthrough diplomacy and cooperation. Brazil endorses \r\nthe Panel’s conclusion regarding peacekeeping missions \r\nand counter-terrorism activities. It is not the role of \r\npeacekeeping missions to perform such activities, and \r\nthey are not equipped to do so. The militarization of \r\npeacekeeping operations would deflect the United \r\nNations from its purpose, which is to promote peace \r\nthrough peaceful solutions. It will therefore be \r\nnecessary to examine how to conceptualize counter-\r\nterrorism tasks, not only in pragmatic terms but also in \r\ntheir doctrinaire and political implications.\r\nBrazil believes more emphasis should be placed on \r\nthe interdependence between security and development \r\nand its impact on peacekeeping operations. Progress \r\nin the area of economic and social development can \r\nhelp foster a greater and more lasting commitment to \r\nstability on the part of the local population, which in \r\nturn is crucial to achieving conditions for sustainable \r\npeace allowing for the successful drawdown of a \r\npeacekeeping mission.\r\nBrazil favours the institutionalization of consultations \r\namong the Secretariat, the Security Council and the \r\ntroop- and police-contributing countries before the \r\nrenewal of the mandates of peacekeeping missions. The \r\nexperience of the Friends of Haiti is one to be borne in \r\nmind in that respect. We need to overcome the illusion of \r\nsequencing between peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \r\nAt the earliest possible stage of the drafting of a \r\nmandate, the Security Council should look into the \r\nroot causes of the conflict, including its economic and \r\nsocial dimensions, and incorporate key peacebuilding \r\nobjectives into the mission’s mandate. In that context, \r\nwe encourage the Assembly to undertake the review \r\nof peacekeeping operations in conjunction with the \r\nreview of the peacebuilding architecture, with a view to \r\n15-30802 17/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\ntheir increased synergy. It is of the utmost importance \r\nthat the recommendations of the Panel be discussed in a \r\ncomprehensive manner by the broad membership under \r\nthe auspices of the General Assembly.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s recently released report \r\non the Panel’s recommendations, entitled “The future of \r\nUnited Nations peace operations: implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations” (A/70/357), reiterates points made \r\nby the Panel and mentions initiatives to be undertaken \r\nby the Secretariat during the remainder of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon’s term. The report suggests that \r\nthe initiatives to be favoured are those which may, in \r\nthe opinion of the Secretariat, be implemented without \r\nthe need for the express authorization of the Member \r\nStates, namely administrative endeavours aimed at \r\nimproving the methods, planning and overall efficiency \r\nof the system.\r\nIn our view, the general membership, and the Special \r\nCommittee on Peacekeeping Operations (C-34) in \r\nparticular, should be given the opportunity to pronounce \r\nthemselves on those opinions. At the same time, we \r\nare disappointed to note that the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport gives scant attention to a key administrative \r\nrecommendation contained in the Panel’s report (see \r\nA/70/95) that a significant majority of Member States \r\nendorses. I am referring to the creation of a separate \r\naccount for the financing of special political missions.\r\nIn sum, improving efficiency is a collective effort \r\nthat depends on the collaboration of all 193 Member \r\nStates. We look forward to discussing all aspects of the \r\nHigh-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations and \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reports within the framework \r\nof the C-34 and the Fourth and Fifth Committees.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): Let me start by thanking \r\nthe Secretary-General for his briefing this morning and \r\nacknowledging the presence of several Panel members \r\nat this important debate.\r\nThe work of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations was seminal in nature. The \r\nSecretary-General’s initiative in convening the Panel \r\nto review peacekeeping did not come a day too soon. \r\nPeacekeeping operations have been a critical instrument \r\nin the toolkit of the United Nations. Blue Helmets have \r\nbecome the most significant and visible contribution of \r\nthe United Nations to international peace and security. \r\nOver the years, they have adapted to the changing \r\nnature and dimensions of conflict, and that process of \r\nchange continues. We hope that the report of the Panel \r\n(A/70/95) and the Secretary-General’s implementation \r\nreport (A/70/357) will take that process forward.\r\nThese reports outline key priority areas for United \r\nNations peacekeeping, along with an agenda for action. \r\nThe recommendations provide a pathway for much-\r\nneeded reform endeavours, including assessments of \r\nplanning capabilities, leadership and training, as well \r\nas more focused mandates. Let me briefly put forward \r\nPakistan’s view on the reports.\r\nThe overall tone of the reports is rightly \r\noptimistic and forward-looking. We are gratified to \r\nsee several of our ideas find resonance in the reports. \r\nThey include the importance of consultations with \r\ntroop-contributing countries, the provision of better \r\nresources for peacekeeping missions, a two-phased \r\nmandate formation process and the non-deployment \r\nof peacekeepers for counter-terrorism operations. We \r\nbelieve the principles of peacekeeping should retain \r\ntheir primacy. The edifice of peacekeeping has been \r\nbuilt on those principles. Adherence to them should \r\nremain the norm. Reform has taken place in the past \r\nwithout affecting the fundamental principles of \r\npeacekeeping, and so it should in the future.\r\nWe agree that political processes should take \r\npre-eminence in conflict prevention. Peacekeeping \r\nmust be accompanied by a clear political track and \r\npolitical objective, on whose successful pursuit should \r\nrest the success of the peacekeeping mission. Increasing \r\nthe Secretariat’s capabilities in the fields of prevention \r\nand mediation should be supported, as that would \r\nenhance its conflict prevention role. Complex mandates \r\ncan be implemented only if peacekeeping operations \r\nare provided with adequate resources. Where mandates \r\nand capabilities are out of sync, the Secretariat should \r\ncandidly counsel the Security Council on remedial \r\nmeasures, and those proposals should be given due \r\nweight by the Council.\r\nOn the issue of the protection of civilians, the Panel \r\nhas proposed laying down requirements for reporting \r\nand accountability to the Security Council. That \r\nconcept needs to be explored and further clarified, as it \r\nis not entirely certain what would be entailed. The core \r\nprinciples of peacekeeping are not an impediment to the \r\nprotection of civilians mandate. The Security Council \r\nframes those mandates, and the use of force in defence \r\nof the mandate is an integral part of the principles. \r\nAdequacy of resources is critical to the fulfilment of \r\nmandates. When mandating enforcement tasks, caution \r\n18/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nis needed, as such operations should be on an exceptional \r\nand a time-limited basis. In that regard, mandates need \r\nto be carefully crafted to retain the distinction between \r\npeacekeeping and peace enforcement. The concept of \r\nproactive defence needs further elaboration.\r\nRapid deployment and standby capabilities need \r\nresources and the streamlining of Secretariat \r\nprocedures, some of which cause delays. Compensation \r\nand the reimbursement of troop costs should continue \r\nto get the focus they merit. A periodic mechanism for \r\nthat purpose needs to be established. We do not support \r\nmorphing the concept of peacekeeping into peace \r\noperations. We believe that is a recipe for confusion \r\nand ambiguity.\r\nThe safety and security of peacekeepers remains \r\nan absolute and overriding priority for my delegation. \r\nPakistani troops serving in peacekeeping operations \r\nare highly motivated, trained and professional. They \r\ncertainly do not shy away from mandated tasks. The \r\ncautious approach that we advocate is merely that \r\nthe United Nations carefully study the impact of \r\nthose changes, including with regard to international \r\nhumanitarian law, the immunity of United Nations \r\npeacekeepers and the safety and security of \r\npeacekeepers when their neutrality is compromised.\r\nWe believe that the reports need thoughtful \r\nexamination and careful study. For that purpose, we \r\nbelieve that the Special Committee on Peacekeeping \r\nOperations (C-34) is the most appropriate body to \r\ndeliberate on the issue. The idea of convening a special \r\nsession of the C-34 to discuss the finer details and chart \r\nout an implementation plan might also be considered.\r\nPakistan has not only consistently been among \r\nthe world’s top troop-contributing countries to United \r\nNations peacekeeping, but is also at the forefront of \r\nnorm-setting on the subject. By way of reinforcing and \r\nreiterating our enduring commitment, Prime Minister \r\nNawaz Sharif co-hosted the leaders’ summit on \r\npeacekeeping last month and announced a series of new \r\npledges to support future endeavours. Let me assure \r\nMember States that our commitment to peacekeeping \r\nis as strong as our commitment to peace itself. Despite \r\nchallenging circumstances at home, we will continue \r\nto provide peacekeepers, as we consider it our sacred \r\nduty to do so. We will continue to support that common \r\ncause.\r\nMr. Cardi (Italy): Italy aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the observer of the European Union. \r\nI join others in thanking the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport (A/70/357) and the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations, led by Mr. Ramos-Horta, for its \r\nwork.\r\nAs the Panel’s report (see A/70/95) clearly highlights, \r\nthe global security challenge has dramatically changed \r\nover the years. We need renewed partnerships and \r\nupdated tools to face today’s challenges. As the foremost \r\nBlue Helmet contributor among Western countries, \r\nItaly has a strong and direct interest in contributing to \r\nthe future of United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nThanks to our presence in the field, we have gathered \r\nconsiderable experience in peacekeeping through the \r\nyears, which we are ready and willing to share.\r\nBefore addressing the more detailed aspects, I want \r\nto stress the need for the United Nations as a whole \r\nto continue to work towards political responses to \r\ncrises. We need to engage much more in mediation and \r\nprevention. The report on peacekeeping operations, the \r\nreport of the Advisory Group of Experts on the Review \r\nof the Peacebuilding Architecture (A/69/968) and the \r\nglobal study on the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000) on women and peace and security \r\nall have a common denominator: the reinforcement \r\nof the tools pertaining to preventive diplomacy. We \r\nthink that we need to return such activities to the core \r\nbusiness of the United Nations.\r\nConflict prevention, confidence-building measures \r\nand mediation instruments must be given the necessary \r\nspace and resources. At the same time, those building \r\ntools are key to ensuring reconciliation and lasting \r\npeace and security and therefore must receive the \r\nproper political and financial support. We are of the \r\nopinion that as the United Nations reviews its tools \r\nwith a view to being more fit for purpose in addressing \r\nthe challenges, those three tracks must proceed in \r\nan integrated, coordinated way, encouraging every \r\npossible synergy.\r\nThe Italian contribution to peacekeeping is not \r\nlimited to supplying troops, as it is complemented \r\nby providing training, naval vessels, air assets and \r\nintelligence resources, integrated by an experienced \r\nmilitary leadership. Italy is not only engaged abroad; \r\nit is also providing training, education and logistical \r\nsupport to United Nations operations on Italian \r\nterritory, through the United Nations logistical base in \r\nBrindisi, which is the first permanent logistical base \r\nto support peacekeeping operations and has been in \r\noperation since 1994.\r\n15-30802 19/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nTraining is crucial to ensure the success and \r\nreputation of the missions. Italy has a strong record \r\nin training national personnel for peace operations. \r\nRespect for human rights, protection of civilians and a \r\ngender perspective are embedded in national military \r\ntraining curricula. Since 2005, the Centre of Excellence \r\nfor Stability Police Units, in Vicenza, run by our \r\nCarabinieri, together with the United States and other \r\nAfrican and European countries, has offered training \r\nprogrammes and developed standards and common \r\noperating procedures to be applied during robust police \r\nactivity. Twenty countries have already sent personnel \r\nto be trained at the Centre.\r\nItaly is also ready to strengthen its engagement \r\nin capacity-building, to support police and military \r\nunits of Member States willing to contribute to United \r\nNations missions. Our focus will be on predeployment \r\ntraining and other sectors where Italy’s expertise is \r\nwell established, such as civil military cooperation, \r\ncountering improvised explosive devices and protection \r\nof civilians. We are all conscious, of course, of the \r\nimportance of predeployment training.\r\nI confirm Italy’s full support for the zero-tolerance \r\npolicy against sexual abuse. Italy, as one of the major \r\ntroop-contributing countries and one of the original \r\nsignatories of the Kigali Declaration, has reaffirmed its \r\ncommitment to working to prevent abuse, from the level \r\nof the training phase in which we are involved, to the \r\ndeployment of more female peacekeepers. Italy can also \r\ncount on the specialized units within its contingents. \r\nThe Carabinieri units, acting as military police, are \r\nable to monitor and investigate any wrongdoing.\r\nThe protection of civilians is a growing challenge \r\nfor United Nations missions when the security context \r\nremains volatile and the reconciliation process is fragile. \r\nAs a relatively new task of the United Nations and its \r\nmissions, the review offers an opportunity to provide \r\na strategic vision on such a crucial topic. In order to \r\ndeliver the effective protection of civilians, strong unity \r\nof intent among the United Nations membership is \r\nneeded. Furthermore, greater effort should be invested \r\nin supporting regional organizations, especially on the \r\nAfrican continent, through training and assistance. The \r\nUnited Nations should seek closer synergies with the \r\nEuropean Union in that respect.\r\nThere is an emerging dimension to which I would \r\nlike to briefly draw attention. It concerns Italy’s belief \r\nabout what should be done to protect cultural heritage \r\nin a crisis situation and may provide a substantial \r\ncontribution to the prevention and reconciliation efforts \r\nled by the United Nations. The cultural dimension, which \r\nhas already been integrated into the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission \r\nin Mali, could represent an additional capability of \r\nUnited Nations peace operations. Based on our national \r\nexperience, we stand ready to promote that approach.\r\nWe live in challenging times and are confronted \r\nby the legitimate expectation, as expressed by public \r\nopinion on behalf of the most severely affected people, \r\nthat the international community should be able to \r\nimplement comprehensive policies, accompanied by \r\neffective tools. We must live up to that expectation \r\nwhile ensuring the credibility of the United Nations in \r\nthe maintenance of peace and security.\r\nMs. Rodríguez Pineda (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Let me begin by thanking the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for convening this important debate \r\nand for his leadership in initiating a process that will \r\nmark the starting point of the work to be carried out \r\nin the coming months. I also express my thanks to the \r\nSecretary-General for his comments.\r\nAs we have said on other occasions, Guatemala \r\nwelcomes many of the recommendations proposed by \r\nthe High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations \r\nin its report (see A/70/95) on the modernization of those \r\noperations. We have also taken note of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the implementation of the Panel’s \r\nrecommendations (A/70/357). We hope to be able to \r\ndiscuss and to implement the recommendations and \r\nproposals contained in both reports; we believe that \r\nthey are mutually complementary and should therefore \r\nbe examined as a whole.\r\nWe have taken note of the differences between the \r\ntwo reports and hope to have a substantive dialogue \r\non all of the issues, particularly regarding regional \r\npartnerships, innovative approaches to planning and \r\nleading peacekeeping operations, the focus on the \r\nground and the involvement of individuals, and the \r\nestablishment of a separate fund for the financing \r\nof special political missions. In that regard, it will \r\nbe necessary to discuss the question of terminology \r\nthat is acceptable to all Member States, including the \r\ndefinition of a peace operation.\r\nWe must all address the fundamental challenges \r\nfaced by United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\ntoday. We recognize that peacekeeping is not an end \r\nin itself, but rather a process. We must bear in mind \r\n20/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nall stages of a conflict, because the end of a conflict \r\ndoes not necessarily signal the establishment of peace. \r\nThe review process also provides an opportunity to \r\nreduce the fragmentation evident in the activities of the \r\nvarious United Nations bodies endowed with peace and \r\nsecurity mandates.\r\nIn addition, we must achieve greater coordination \r\nand cohesion with other review processes to be \r\nundertaken this year. We hope to better harmonize \r\nthe three agendas. Unlike in the process to review the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping architecture, where two \r\nfacilitators have already been appointed and where a \r\nroad map on moving forward already exists, we are not \r\nquite sure about how to proceed with the two reports \r\nbefore the Assembly. In that regard, we believe that \r\nin each of the spaces that exist to examine the various \r\nissues addressed in both reports, we can achieve the \r\nagreements necessary to advance the work of the United \r\nNations peacekeepers.\r\nWe recognize the value of the Special Committee \r\non Peacekeeping Operations in providing a forum \r\nfor countries such as mine to join in the discussion \r\non ways to improve and increase the effectiveness of \r\nthe peacekeeping operations. We also recognize the \r\nrelevance of the discussions in the Fourth Committee \r\non political issues associated with the special political \r\nmissions and in the Fifth Committee on budgetary and \r\nadministrative matters. This does not mean that we will \r\nsettle for any agreement, but we hope that it will be the \r\ntype of agreement that will lead to significant reforms \r\nfor a new collective vision of the Organization and what \r\nthe United Nations should be doing in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security.\r\nMy delegation is ready to actively participate to \r\nadvance the work of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Delattre (France) (spoke in French): The \r\nSecretary-General took the initiative to launch a \r\nstrategic review of peacekeeping operations, and today \r\nwe are considering his proposals on the basis of the \r\nwork done by the High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeace Operations, led by Mr. Ramos-Horta, to whom \r\nI am pleased to pay tribute. France is grateful to the \r\nSecretary-General for having taken this initiative and \r\ncongratulates the Independent Panel and the Secretariat \r\nfor carrying out this major undertaking under tight \r\ndeadlines. Allow me to make three observations.\r\nFirst, we support the conceptual framework \r\nproposed by the Secretary-General. France agrees that \r\npriority should be given to seeking political agreements \r\nin order to achieve lasting solutions to crises. That is \r\nthe very raison d’être of peacekeeping. Similarly, \r\nFrance welcomes the fact that the protection of civilians \r\nand human rights are recognized as fundamental goals \r\nin peacekeeping. In this connection, we support the \r\nHuman Rights Up Front initiative and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s intention to promote an active and early \r\nengagement by the United Nations where there is a \r\nthreat to civilians.\r\nThese two requirements call for dynamic, engaged \r\nand sometimes, when necessary, robust peacekeeping. \r\nWe believe the Secretary-General has found the right \r\nbalance in this regard. A United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperation cannot impose solutions by force, but must \r\nknow how to use force in support of the search for \r\npolitical solutions and the imperative of protecting \r\ncivilians when circumstances require it.\r\nMy second point is that France supports the main \r\nprinciples, such as the immediate measures identified \r\nby the Secretary-General, as a guide for United Nations \r\naction in crisis situations. First of all, there is the \r\nprinciple of being exemplary. The Blue Helmets embody \r\nthe values  of the Charter of the United Nations and our \r\nshared conscience. They serve the people. In this regard, \r\nthe recent cases of sexual abuse are unacceptable. \r\nFrance supports the proposals of the Secretary-General \r\nto further strengthen the zero-tolerance policy applied \r\nto the Blue Helmets and ensures that the same principle \r\napplies to our national troops when they are abroad.\r\nWe should also support the principle of \r\naccountability. It must be applied at all levels, from the \r\nlocal level of operations on the ground to the strategic \r\nlevel of the decisions taken by the Security Council. We \r\nbelieve it is important to strengthen the accountability \r\nof the heads of missions. France will continue to ensure \r\nthat this principle guides the decision-making by the \r\nCouncil, in particular in the development of targeted, \r\ncoherent and sequenced mandates. The principles \r\nof partnership and coordination are also compasses \r\nfor United Nations action. Partnership with regional \r\norganizations, on the basis of Chapter VIII, must be \r\nstrengthened. The principle of coordination should \r\nallow the various United Nations funds and agencies on \r\nthe ground to work together more effectively.\r\nThirdly, our main concern, ultimately, is that the \r\nUnited Nations be more effective and proactive on \r\nthe ground, as the Secretary-General has just stated. \r\nThis imperative of efficiency can be achieved quickly \r\n15-30802 21/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nthrough simple and inexpensive reorganization and \r\nprocedural reform measures. The first of these, in the \r\nspirit of the report before us, is to empower the actors \r\non the ground and make them accountable and to adapt \r\nthe procedures to enable the necessary f lexibility. \r\nCompetencies and capacities should be in place at \r\nHeadquarters and on the ground, and we count on the \r\nmobilization of the Secretariat on this subject. In the \r\nsame spirit, the Secretariat’s internal procedures must \r\nbe thoroughly reviewed. Some rules for hiring civilian \r\npersonnel are too cumbersome and slow. Similarly, \r\nsome rules allowing for the provision of support and \r\nequipment to troops should be improved in order to be \r\nmore responsive.\r\nFinally, as the Secretary-General has stated and as \r\nis indicated in the report (A/70/357), we must protect \r\nthe security of the staff of the peacekeeping operations \r\nand that begins with better governance of health-care \r\nissues in the operations. Better supervision and an \r\naccountability framework must be established. There \r\nare other priorities we could mention, such as the use \r\nof new technologies and a strengthening of intelligence \r\ncapacities, which also lead to important improvements \r\nin peacekeeping.\r\nFrance will continue to participate and support \r\nUnited Nations peace operations and participate fully \r\nin order to enhance their effectiveness.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): I thank the President for \r\norganizing this important meeting.\r\nCroatia aligns itself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe observer of the European Union, and I will make \r\nsome additional remarks in my national capacity.\r\nFirst, we thank and commend the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/70/357) on the future of the \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations. It is a very \r\ntimely report not only because it comes as we mark \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of our Organization, but \r\neven more so because it comes at a time when we are \r\nfaced with unprecedented challenges — more armed \r\nconflicts, terrorism and violent extremism, more than \r\n60 million refugees and internally displaced persons, \r\nmigration and humanitarian crises.\r\nFor many years United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations have helped to maintain international peace \r\nand security around the world. Croatia can bear witness \r\nto that. In the early 1990s, Croatia was the theatre of one \r\nof the largest United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nin history. Important lessons were learned during that \r\ntime, and we must constantly remain mindful of them, \r\nespecially when it comes to the clarity of mandates and \r\nthe means of implementing them.\r\nToday, with the growing complexity of challenges \r\nin the international order, United Nations peacekeeping \r\nis as important to international peace and stability as \r\never. Nothing short of a comprehensive and thorough \r\nanalysis is needed in order to help United Nations \r\npeacekeeping adapt to the realities of a globalized world \r\nand its regional specificities. For that reason Croatia \r\nstrongly welcomes and commends the excellent work \r\ndone by the High-level Independent Panel on Peace \r\nOperations led by Mr. Ramos-Horta, as well as the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General on the implementation \r\nof the recommendations of the Panel.\r\nWe are confident that the report will provide a strong \r\nbasis and guidance for increasing the effectiveness \r\nof United Nations peace operations and enhancing \r\nsynergy between all the components of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping. I would like to reiterate in particular \r\nthe following points that were raised by Croatia at the \r\nhighest level earlier this month. Rapid-deployment \r\ncapacity should be efficiently ensured. Mandates should \r\nbe clear, precise and realistic. They should be designed \r\naccording to specific circumstances in a given context. \r\nThere must be no ambiguity concerning the tasks that \r\nshould be accomplished.\r\nCreating more clarity in mandates is a way to \r\nimprove their outcome. Mandates must be focused \r\non protecting civilians and those most vulnerable in \r\nconflicts, namely, women, children and the elderly. In \r\nour view, the protection of civilians is one of the crucial \r\ndimensions of peacekeeping and is often decisive for the \r\nsuccess and legitimacy of United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. The failures and successes of the past must \r\nserve as lessons for the future. What happened in \r\nSrebrenica 20 years ago is a poignant example that must \r\nnot be repeated under any circumstances.\r\nWe stress the need for the active and meaningful \r\nparticipation of women in conflict prevention, conflict \r\nresolution and peace processes, including the need to \r\nincrease their role in decision-making in all areas. We \r\nall need to increase our efforts to mainstream gender \r\naspects into peace operations. Promoting respect for \r\nhuman rights also has to be an essential part of conflict \r\nprevention and peacekeeping and, as such, should be \r\nreflected in the mandates. One of our priorities should be \r\nthe prevention of sexual and gender-based violence. We \r\nare particularly concerned about accusations of sexual \r\n22/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nexploitation and abuse by several of the peacekeeping \r\ntroops. It has to be clearly stated that such conduct is \r\nunacceptable, that those cases should be thoroughly \r\nand rapidly investigated, that such actions must be \r\npublicly denounced and that their perpetrators must be \r\nheld accountable. United Nations personnel are there to \r\nprotect and help, and any misuse of that noble role must \r\nbe condemned unequivocally.\r\nThe link between security and development should \r\nconstantly remain in our focus. Once a conflict is \r\ncontained and the peacekeeping mission proves to \r\nbe operative in practice, it must be accompanied by \r\ntimely and clearly defined development efforts. In that \r\ncontext, we see a clear linkage between the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/70/357) and the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution A/70/1), as well \r\nas other review processes. We believe that the parallel \r\nreview processes of the peacekeeping operations and \r\npeacebuilding architecture and the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women \r\nand peace and security, will provide strategic and \r\noperational recommendations that should be read \r\ntogether to create constructive synergy.\r\nPeace operations today encompass a range \r\nof operations that take place in all phases of the \r\nconflict cycle, including prevention, peacekeeping, \r\npeacemaking and peacebuilding, and reconstruction \r\nand development roles. There is a clear linkage between \r\nall of those roles, all of which require our attention. \r\nNevertheless, we welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\ncall urging that prevention and mediation be put at the \r\ncentre of international peace and security efforts and \r\nthat United Nations tools to prevent and mediate crises \r\nbe strengthened in order to help create faster and more \r\ncost-effective responses to conflicts.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that the effectiveness \r\nof United Nations peacekeeping operations is the \r\nresponsibility of all Member States. On our behalf, I \r\ncan reiterate Croatia’s readiness and determination to \r\ncontinue to actively contribute to making United Nations \r\npeacekeeping even more effective and efficient. Croatia \r\nrecently participated in the peacekeeping summit \r\nhosted by President Obama, where we announced \r\nour new contribution to United Nations peacekeeping \r\nefforts, to which we remain committed.\r\nLastly, let me reiterate our words of gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General for his leadership in preparing the \r\nUnited Nations to rise to the challenges of the future.\r\nMr. Menelaou (Cyprus): Cyprus aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered earlier on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union, and would like to add the following in \r\nits national capacity.\r\nWe express our appreciation to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/70/357) and to the members of \r\nthe High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, \r\nchaired by Mr. José Ramos-Horta, for their invaluable \r\nwork and the inclusive and transparent way, in which \r\nthey accomplished their task.\r\nCyprus has served as host to a United Nations \r\npeacekeeping mission for over 50 years. We therefore \r\nhave first-hand experience of the evolving nature of \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping. We are also aware of \r\nthe fact that for every dimension of the work of the \r\nOrganization, peacekeeping needs to be harmonized \r\nwith contemporary challenges in order to effectively \r\nrespond to present-day needs, while upholding its \r\npurposes as defined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nFrom that angle, we wish to reflect on several aspects \r\nthat were identified and then developed in the report, \r\nwhich in our view, should be among the fundamental \r\ncomponents of effective peacekeeping.\r\nFirst, we fully share the position advanced in the \r\nreport that negotiated political settlements should be \r\nthe fundamental objective of United Nations peace \r\noperations and that such political solutions to conflicts \r\ndepend ultimately on a country’s people and leaders. \r\nThe United Nations role is, as the report also states, \r\nto assist parties to arrive at sustainable political \r\nagreements. Let us underline, in that regard, that in \r\ndischarging that role, the United Nations must be \r\nneutral but not neutralized, and that impartiality is not \r\nthe same as being equidistant between the Charter and \r\nresolutions, on the one hand, and illegality, on the other. \r\nIn the same vein, we consider that sequenced mandates \r\nconstitute an innovative notion that can strengthen the \r\nadjustability of peace operations without outweighing \r\npolitical primacy or overemphasizing methodological \r\nconsiderations.\r\nSecondly, Cyprus fully agrees that human rights, \r\ngender equality and the participation of women in \r\npeace operations, as well as the humanitarian role of \r\npeacekeeping, should be placed at the heart of peace \r\noperations and the security agenda. Specifically, with \r\nregard to the humanitarian aspects, efforts must be \r\nredoubled and resources increased in the area of truth \r\nand reconciliation for the purpose of discovering and \r\nrevealing past wrongdoing.\r\n15-30802 23/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nIn conclusion, let me once again express our \r\nappreciation to the Secretary-General for his efforts \r\nand reassure him of our support for more coherent, \r\ntransparent and effective United Nations peacekeeping.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): I would like to begin by \r\nexpressing my sincere appreciation for the President’s \r\nleadership in convening today’s timely meeting. I would \r\nalso like to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his report (A/70/357) and his briefing today. My \r\ngratitude also goes to Mr. José Ramos-Horta, Chair \r\nof the High-level Independent Panel on Peacekeeping \r\nOperations, who is present among us today, and to the \r\nother Panel members for their excellent report (see \r\nA/70/95).\r\nTwo weeks ago, leaders of more than 50 countries \r\nand organizations, including my own, discussed United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations at the United Nations, \r\nunder the chairmanship of President Obama of the \r\nUnited States. My hope is that the momentum created \r\nby the leaders’ summit on the issue will give a strong \r\nimpetus to our upcoming intergovernmental discussion \r\non the two reports on United Nations peace operations \r\ncurrently before of us. Before discussing the reports, let \r\nme say a few words about United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations.\r\nAlthough this is not stipulated in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, peacekeeping operations have been \r\nan integral part of United Nations activities on peace \r\nand security. Because of their excellent results, and \r\nthe high expectations placed in them, their roles and \r\nresponsibilities have been expanded. In fact, over the \r\npast decade, the number of deployed peacekeepers has \r\ndoubled, from 65,000 to 123,000. The peacekeeping \r\nbudget has also increased. For the biennium 2004-2005, \r\nit was approximately $4 billion; the budget 10 years \r\nlater has hit a historic high of $8.5 billion. While we can \r\nacknowledge the excellent work done by peacekeeping \r\noperations in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security in places like Cambodia and Timor-Leste, \r\nthe challenge we now face is how to make peacekeeping \r\noperations sustainable with the limited financial and \r\nhuman resources available.\r\nFifteen years ago, we were all involved in finalizing a \r\nvery comprehensive review of peacekeeping operations \r\nknown as the Brahimi report. I took part in that review. \r\nI believe that the most important sentence of the report \r\nis the one that says, “But force alone cannot create \r\npeace; it can only create the space in which peace may \r\nbe built” (A/55/305, p. viii). The primary role of military \r\noperations is to create space for the political process to \r\nachieve a viable peace.\r\nWe should conduct a thorough review of peacekeeping \r\noperations that examines the need for each mission \r\nbased on that criterion. In that context, military missions \r\nthat have been deployed for a long time should be called \r\ninto question. I would like to point out that six of the \r\ncurrent 16 peacekeeping missions have had military \r\ntroops deployed for more than a decade; three of those \r\nmissions have had troops deployed for more than three \r\ndecades. We all know which missions they are. Are so \r\nmany years of military presence not sufficient to give \r\nthe political leaders of the parties to those conflicts the \r\nspace in which to build peace? If not sufficient, then \r\nfor how many more years do the peacekeepers need to \r\ncontinue their work? We should continuously check \r\nwhether the current configuration of peacekeeping \r\nmissions and other United Nations instruments for \r\ninternational peace and security, including special \r\npolitical missions, are the most effective means for \r\nachieving sustainable peace.\r\nThe two reports before us today urge that each \r\nmission be more adaptive to the situation and needs \r\non the ground. To that end, we need to ensure that the \r\nmission’s mandate is elaborated in accordance with the \r\nreality on the ground and that it is responsive to the \r\nchanging field situation. The Secretary-General should \r\nkeep a close eye on developments on the ground and \r\nshould make timely and realistic recommendations \r\nto the Security Council. The Security Council should \r\nreview each mission’s mandate in a timely manner to \r\nensure the effectiveness of the mission’s activities. \r\nThe automatic renewal of mission mandates should \r\nbe avoided, and the mandates of prolonged missions \r\nshould be thoroughly reviewed.\r\nWe also need to enhance our human resources. \r\nEven though highly qualified personnel are necessary \r\nfor today’s peacekeeping operations, we all too often \r\nstruggle to meet that requirement. There is a pressing \r\nneed to increase the number of qualified personnel. \r\nTraining is an indispensable tool for creating qualified \r\npeacekeepers. The two reports welcome capacity-\r\nbuilding initiatives through so-called triangular \r\npartnership arrangements between the Secretariat, \r\ntroop contributors and third-party countries with \r\nspecific capabilities. The Department of Field Support \r\nand Japan jointly launched a pioneering project for \r\nAfrican troop-contributing countries, to which Japan \r\ncontributed approximately $40 million for funding \r\n24/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nthe project and for trainers. In September, the project \r\nstarted trial training in Kenya; full-scale training will \r\nfollow next year.\r\nBefore closing, I regret having to touch on one \r\nnegative aspect of United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. Recent allegations of reprehensible sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse by peacekeepers, particularly the \r\nlatest allegations in the Central African Republic, have \r\ndamaged the Organization’s integrity and credibility. \r\nThe bad news is that this is neither the only nor the first \r\nsuch case. Such unacceptable misconduct tarnishes \r\nthe noble contributions of the more than 100,000 \r\npeacekeepers being deployed today. Concrete and \r\nrobust measures against such unacceptable behaviour \r\nare necessary. To that end, Japan strongly supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s zero-tolerance policy and calls \r\nfor the immediate implementation of the measures \r\nrecommended in his report.\r\nFinally, I would like to mention one point regarding \r\nthe budgetary issues with respect to all categories \r\nof United Nations peace operations, including \r\npeacekeeping operations and special political missions. \r\nAlthough the two reports include numerous important \r\ninitiatives, we are concerned about their possible cost \r\nimplications. Every single dollar spent by the United \r\nNations comes from the taxpayers of the Member \r\nStates. We therefore urge the Secretariat to absorb \r\nany add-ons, to the greatest extent possible, within the \r\nexisting resources.\r\nIn line with the points that I have raised today, my \r\ndelegation will proactively contribute to subsequent \r\ndiscussions on the recommendations of the two reports \r\nin the relevant bodies of the General Assembly, such \r\nas the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations \r\nand the Fourth and Fifth Committees.\r\nIn closing, I would like to express my sincere \r\nappreciation to all field personnel serving in United \r\nNations peace operations and to offer my deepest \r\ncondolences for those personnel who have made the \r\nultimate sacrifice.\r\nMr. Skoog (Sweden): Sweden aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made this morning by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nSweden warmly welcomes the opportunity to \r\ndiscus the very timely review of United Nations peace \r\noperations. It has set out important steps, not just \r\ntowards strengthening United Nations peacekeeping \r\ncapabilities, but also towards reforming United Nations \r\nresponses to challenges to peace and security as a \r\nwhole. That review, together with the review of the \r\npeacebuilding architecture and the global study on \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), has created a \r\nreal momentum for reform, an opportunity that should \r\nnot be missed.\r\nWe would like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report (A/70/357) on the future of United \r\nNations peace operations, which takes up many of the \r\nrecommendations of the excellent work of the High-\r\nlevel Independent Panel on Peace Operations. We find \r\nthe report balanced, constructive and operational. In \r\nthat regard, we would like to highlight three aspects as \r\nwe move forward.\r\nFirst, we particularly welcome the focus on the \r\nentire conflict cycle of planning and executing peace \r\noperations. Operations should be designed not only \r\nto keep the peace but also to facilitate post-conflict \r\npeacebuilding, to help prevent lapses and relapses into \r\nconflict and to assist with progress towards sustainable \r\npeace and development. Also, peacebuilding activities \r\nneed to be given adequate resources to work effectively. \r\nWe support the concept of a continuum of peace \r\noperations, thereby moving away from the increasingly \r\nartificial distinction between traditional peacekeeping \r\noperations and special political missions.\r\nSecondly, it is crucial that a gender perspective \r\nand the conclusions of the review of resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) be integrated into all aspects of United Nations \r\npeace operations, throughout mission life cycles and \r\nacross mandated tasks. Unfortunately, we have a long \r\nway to go to achieve that objective, but we nonetheless \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General’s resolve to increase \r\naccountability and root out sexual exploitation and \r\nabuse among the ranks of United Nations personnel in \r\nthe field.\r\nThirdly, partnerships with regional organizations \r\nare central to effective international peace and security \r\nengagements. As recent history has shown, not least in \r\nAfrica, regional forces are often faster to deploy and \r\nbetter able to act swiftly and decisively. The African \r\nUnion (AU) has led the way with its efforts to fully \r\noperationalize its African Standby Force. Sweden is \r\nalready a major supporter of institution and capacity-\r\nbuilding endeavours within the African Union and \r\nremains fully committed to facilitating further \r\nintegration between United Nations and AU capabilities.\r\n15-30802 25/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nIn conclusion, we must be realistic about the \r\nchallenges ahead but ambitious in our responses, and \r\nwe all have a responsibility to see the process through. \r\nThe Secretary-General’s leadership in implementing \r\nthe recommendations in his report that fall within his \r\nremit is crucial, but we would also like to call on the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to seize this \r\nopportunity to reform the United Nations peace and \r\nsecurity architecture in all relevant forums and make \r\nit fit to tackle the security challenges of today and \r\ntomorrow. Sweden stands ready to do its part in that.\r\nMr. Toro-Carnevali (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We align ourselves with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the representative of \r\nMorocco on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. We \r\nare very grateful for the convening of today’s meeting \r\nto discuss the two reports before us.\r\nThe report of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations (see A/70/95) — the “Nyakhat \r\nreport” — provides us with a profound reflection on the \r\nfuture of the United Nations peacekeeping architecture. \r\nWhile the report makes specific recommendations on \r\nhow to reform and improve the work of the Organization, \r\nits greatest contribution lies in having put on paper the \r\ncomplexity, challenges and the contradictions that face \r\nany agenda for reform in this area.\r\nTurning to some concrete examples of such \r\nchallenges, the report stresses the importance of \r\ngiving priority to political solutions in the design and \r\ndeployment of peacekeeping operations, but at the same \r\ntime recognizes that most conflicts today are more \r\nintricate and less conducive to political resolution than \r\nformerly. The report urges that peacekeeping operations \r\nleave behind the culture of white sport utility vehicles \r\nand armoured trucks and focus more on people, on \r\nshowing a more human face and interacting more with \r\nlocal communities in order to better understand their \r\nneeds and aspirations. At the same time, however, the \r\nreport stresses that 90 per cent of political missions and \r\ntwo thirds of peacekeeping operations are deployed in \r\nhigh-risk situations where conflicts are still ongoing \r\nand there are serious security concerns for personnel.\r\nThe report sees prevention and mediation as playing \r\na key role, with an emphasis on discreet preventive \r\ndiplomacy that by its nature will go unrecognized if \r\nit is successful. At the same time, the report stresses \r\nthat precisely because such preventive mediation and \r\ndiplomacy is discreet and quiet, it does not attract \r\ndonors’ attention and suffers from chronic budget \r\nshortfalls.\r\nThe report agrees with the view of humanitarian \r\nworkers that peacekeeping operations must be \r\ncommitted to an maintaining an open dialogue with \r\nall parties to a conflict, State and non-State actors \r\nalike, and should explore all alternatives to violence. \r\nHowever, it indicates that at times some peacekeeping \r\noperations with exceptional mandates can themselves \r\nbecome parties to a conflict, with serious consequences \r\nfor their impartiality and for the Organization’s \r\nhumanitarian tasks. There are many examples such \r\nas these that highlight the deep complexity of peace \r\noperations. The Secretary-General’s report (A/70/357) \r\nmakes a significant effort to take the more operational \r\naspects of the Panel’s report and translate them into \r\nconcrete policies, although it does not always follow the \r\nPanel’s recommendations and sometimes introduces \r\nnew elements. Both reports are important and should \r\nbe carefully considered. Privileging one report over \r\nthe other as the sole source for intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation processes would be a serious error. Both \r\nhave much to contribute.\r\nThe work on the High-level Panel’s report was \r\ndone transparently and was the product of extensive \r\nregional consultations, but its legitimacy, and that of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, will depend on the \r\ndecisions to be adopted by the Special Committee on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations, the only body charged with \r\ndesigning the policies and doctrines that govern those \r\noperations, and by other relevant committees of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Alday González (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation is grateful for the convening of this \r\nmeeting to discuss the Secretary-General’s report on the \r\nfuture of United Nations peace operations (A/70/357). \r\nThe recommendations of the Secretary-General and of \r\nthe High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, \r\nskilfully led by Mr. José Ramos-Horta, along with \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the Organization, have \r\ngiven us a unique opportunity to reflect on the role we \r\nbelieve the United Nations should play in international \r\nrelations in the future. Mexico sees it as a test of the \r\nwill and commitment of Member States to finding \r\nsolutions to the multidimensional problems we face, \r\nand to formulate and implement solutions to political, \r\nsecurity, development, human rights and humanitarian \r\nissues.\r\n26/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nThe world increasingly demands more of the staff \r\nof our peacekeeping operations and special political \r\nmissions, and we the Member States have not been able \r\nto agree on providing the Organization with all the \r\nresources it needs to discharge its mandate. We believe \r\nthat, in order to be effective and efficient, the future of \r\npeacekeeping operations cannot continue to be subject \r\nto unpredictable resource allocation. We therefore \r\nurge that immediate steps be taken to improve the \r\nsituation. We strongly support the clear and convincing \r\nrecommendation of the High-level Independent Panel \r\nfor the immediate adoption of measures to set up a \r\nspecial separate account for special political missions, \r\nand we regret that the Secretary-General has not placed \r\nmore emphasis on that proposal in his report (A/70/357).\r\nIn our collective efforts, we must acknowledge \r\nthe growing importance of the role that regional and \r\nsubregional organizations play in conflict resolution, as \r\nwell as the relevance — emphasized by the Independent \r\nPanel and the Secretary-General — of prevention, \r\nproviding mediation and favouring political over \r\nmilitary solutions, which has been one of the historical \r\npillars of Mexican foreign policy. The General \r\nAssembly, the Fourth Committee, the Fifth Committee, \r\nand the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations \r\nshould, in Mexico’s opinion, play an important role in \r\nthe discussion of all proposals presented in efforts to \r\ndefine any implementation process.\r\nWe believe that the innovative solutions referred \r\nto by the Secretariat should not contravene the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, and \r\nin that regard, we strongly support, for example, the \r\nIndependent Panel’s recommendation that the mandates \r\nfor peacekeeping operations not include anti-terrorist \r\nactivities. At the same time, we cannot allow current \r\nconflicts to continue to wreak havoc and past conflicts \r\nto return with renewed violence. For my delegation, \r\nthere is no better investment than to invest in the peace \r\nand security of our societies; we all have a global \r\nresponsibility.\r\nIn our discussion, as we carry out an analysis of the \r\nfuture of peacekeeping operations and special political \r\nmissions, it is essential that we take every possible \r\nmeasure to prevent the recurrence of sexual abuse \r\nperpetrated by United Nations personnel and bring to \r\njustice all those who have committed it. The most visible \r\nface of the United Nations around the world cannot \r\nserve as a cover-up for that minority. Accountability \r\nmust be an imperative, not just an aspiration or a goal. \r\nIt is essential that the civil and military personnel of \r\nthe United Nations behave in a manner consistent with \r\nthe values of the Organization and that all States that \r\ncontribute personnel to United Nations operations \r\nassume our responsibilities in that matter.\r\nThe exercise on which we are embarking today \r\nought to help us to clearly define the road map that \r\nwill enable us to strengthen the performance and \r\nthe influence of the Organization in confronting the \r\nchallenges to international peace and security so that \r\nwe can save succeeding generations from the scourge \r\nof war. The delegation of Mexico will continue to \r\nparticipate constructively in the review process \r\nas well as in other areas that are being conducted \r\nsimultaneously, such as the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nand the high-level review of resolution 1325 (2000). We \r\nhope that those processes generate synergies and will \r\nreinforce each other so as to enable the United Nations \r\nsystem to offer the best possible response.\r\nMs. Faizunnesa (Bangladesh): Bangladesh aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nMorocco on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe consultation process carried out by the High-\r\nlevel Independent Panel on Peace Operations kicked \r\noff in the capital of Bangladesh, Dhaka. Today, we are \r\nindeed pleased and encouraged to see that its report (see \r\nA/70/95) has been issued in a timely manner. We wish \r\nto thank the High-level Panel and welcome its report. \r\nWe are also particularly thankful for and welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/70/357) presented this \r\nmorning.\r\nWe look forward to the recommendations of the \r\nHigh-level Panel being implemented in an effective \r\nway. Bangladesh remains committed to supporting \r\nthe Secretary-General’s initiative in implementing the \r\nHigh-level Panel’s report and in addressing the existing \r\nand projected gaps in United Nations peace operations. \r\nAs one of the largest troop-contributing countries \r\n(TCCs) and police-contributing countries (PCCs), we \r\nconsider the High-level Panel’s report very important. \r\nThe Secretary-General has provided a pragmatic \r\nroad map for implementing the recommendations in \r\nthe report. We would like to see a full and effective \r\nimplementation of those recommendations in a \r\ntransparent manner through the due involvement of the \r\nrelevant United Nations committees and bodies.\r\nOn 28 September, Her Excellency Sheikh Hasina, \r\nPrime Minister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh, \r\n15-30802 27/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nin her capacity as a host of the 2015 leaders’ summit \r\non United Nations peace operations, underscored \r\nBangladesh’s strong and steadfast commitment to United \r\nNations peace operations. We shall support efforts \r\naimed at bringing into effect the recommendations of \r\nthe High-level Panel. We are ready to further engage \r\non the constructive ideas that the Secretary-General \r\nhas put forward in his report. We would also like to \r\nurge that all the TCCs and PCCs be taken on board to \r\nparticipate in discussions and consultations during the \r\nimplementation process.\r\nWe reiterate our full support for the effort to \r\nstrengthen the hands of the United Nations by providing \r\ncapable, well-trained and equipped peacekeepers to fulfil \r\nthe mandated tasks. In that regard, let me share with the \r\nAssembly that Bangladesh has a state-of-the-art centre \r\nin situ for peace-support operations and training, which \r\nis called the Bangladesh Institute of Peace Support \r\nOperation Training. We are developing it as a centre \r\nof excellence for training peacekeepers, particularly \r\nfemale peacekeepers. With the evolving nature of \r\npeace operations, Bangladesh has constantly updated \r\nits deployment capabilities. We have demonstrated the \r\ncapacity to respond to the needs of missions in high-\r\nrisk conflict nations on very short notice. In Mali, \r\nthe eastern Congo and the Central African Republic, \r\nBangladesh was the quickest to deploy troops under \r\nthe Blue Helmets. We aim to promote the protection of \r\ncivilians and the mainstreaming of gender and human \r\nrights issues, as well as to offer language skills to our \r\npeacekeepers, through training.\r\nThere is an imperative need to have a better \r\nsystem in place to ensure the safety and security of \r\npeacekeepers. As the Secretary-General’s remarks \r\nindicated this morning, we must show zero tolerance \r\nfor sexual misconduct by peacekeepers.\r\nLastly, we wish to highlight that Bangladesh \r\nlooks forward to the high-level thematic debate to be \r\nconvened in May 2016 by the President of the General \r\nAssembly. We reiterate our full commitment to the \r\nimplementation of the High-level Panel’s report.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to thank the President for \r\nconvening this meeting on an issue of importance to the \r\ninternational community, namely, that of strengthening \r\nthe United Nations system, and for enabling Member \r\nStates to express their views on the outcome of the \r\nSecretary-General’s High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeace Operations. My thanks also go to Mr. Ramos-\r\nHorta, Chair of the High-level Panel, and to the \r\nSecretary-General for their valuable reports, contained \r\nin documents A/70/95 and A/70/357, respectively.\r\nI align myself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Morocco on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nWhile we are grateful to the troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries of the United Nations \r\nfor their efforts to assist countries in crisis, we should \r\nnot ignore the shameful actions of some individuals \r\nthat have tarnished the efforts of tens of thousands \r\nof United Nations peacekeepers and other personnel. \r\nWe must do more to tackle such profound challenges, \r\nand we therefore need new approaches, solutions and \r\ninitiatives to deal with those problems. We appreciate \r\nthe initiative of the Secretary-General in establishing \r\na high-level panel to review the past practices of the \r\nUnited Nations in its peace operations.\r\nWhile we attach great importance to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report and respect his views on how to \r\nimplement the recommendations in the High-level \r\nPanel’s report, the Government of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran would like to emphasize the following points.\r\nFirst, we should avoid hasty implementation of the \r\nrecommendations. Giving them sufficiently careful \r\nthought in an appropriate forum is a must if we want to \r\nhave successful peacekeeping operations in the future.\r\nSecond, we stress the importance of the General \r\nAssembly’s role as the most democratic organ of the \r\nUnited Nations where peacekeeping operations are \r\nconcerned. The Assembly has the primary role and \r\nresponsibility for formulating concepts, policies \r\nand budgetary decisions relating to peacekeeping \r\noperations. In that regard, I would like to point out \r\nthat, in accordance with paragraph 20 of the report of \r\nthe Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations \r\n(A/68/19), the Special Committee is the only United \r\nNations forum mandated to review comprehensively \r\nthe whole question of peacekeeping operations in all \r\ntheir aspects.\r\nThird, the Government of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran fully supports strengthening and enhancing \r\nthe capacity of the United Nations in the fields of \r\npeacemaking, peacebuilding, peacekeeping, mediation \r\nand so forth, with the aim of maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\n28/29 15-30802\r\nA/70/PV.29 12/10/2015\r\nFourth, in all United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, we must respect the principles of the \r\nsovereign equality, political independence and \r\nterritorial integrity of all States and of non-intervention \r\nin matters that are essentially within States’ domestic \r\njurisdiction.\r\nFifth, it is vital that we observe the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations in all \r\npeace operations, along with the basic principles for \r\nsuch operations that have guided them thus far, namely, \r\nthe consent of the parties, impartiality and the non-use \r\nof force except in self-defence. They remain valid and \r\nrelevant, and must be fully preserved.\r\nSixth, we must take great care when considering \r\nthe adoption of any new concepts aimed at addressing \r\nemerging needs and demands emanating from the \r\ncomplexity of peacekeeping operations. Any such \r\nconcepts should be formulated and agreed on by the \r\nentire United Nations membership through a relevant \r\nintergovernmental process.\r\nSeventh, any contribution in support of a host \r\ncountry in its restoration or establishment of the rule of \r\nlaw should take into account national ownership as well \r\nas the cultural diversity and specificity of each country.\r\nEighth, the role of host countries in formulating and \r\nimplementing activities relating to the peacebuilding \r\nprocess should be fully recognized.\r\nNinth, the protection of civilians is the primary \r\nresponsibility of the host country and should not be \r\nused as a pretext for military intervention in countries \r\nthat are in a state of conflict or emerging from conflict.\r\nTenth, primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security rests with the \r\nUnited Nations, and the role of regional arrangements \r\nand agencies in that regard should accord with Chapter \r\nVIII of the Charter.\r\nEleventh, we need to take full account of the \r\nprinciple of equitable geographical distribution \r\nin the staffing and structure of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations and the Department of Field \r\nSupport.\r\nTwelfth, the United Nations should use the \r\navailable capacities of the whole membership in peace \r\noperations, including in the areas of the military, \r\npolice, civilians and logistics. Any requests from the \r\nSecretariat for contributions from Member States to \r\npeacekeeping missions should, therefore, be transparent \r\nand be extended to all current and potential troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries.\r\nThirteenth, the Islamic Republic of Iran fully \r\nsupports efforts to restore the quest for peaceful \r\npolitical settlements to the centre of United Nations \r\nefforts to prevent and resolve conflicts.\r\nLastly, it is also essential that we give full attention \r\nto the root causes of conflicts, since it is clear that \r\nprevention is possible only if the root causes are known.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my \r\ndelegation’s commitment to supporting any endeavour \r\naimed at peacemaking, peacebuilding, peacekeeping \r\nand mediation and to fully cooperating and working \r\nconstructively with the President of the General \r\nAssembly, the Secretary-General and all Member \r\nStates in that regard.\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank the President for organizing this \r\nimportant debate. In the wake of the work of the High-\r\nlevel Independent Panel on Peace Operations (see \r\nA/70/95) and the publication of the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on the recommendations of the High-level Panel \r\n(A/70/357), it is essential that we maintain the current \r\nmomentum in order to strengthen the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping and conflict-prevention architecture. \r\nAt this point, instead of deeply into the rich subject \r\nmatter before us, Switzerland we will simply make \r\nsome general remarks on the two reports and on the \r\nway forward.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the report of the High-level \r\nIndependent Panel on Peace Operations and looks \r\nforward to the implementation of its recommendations. \r\nThe High-level Panel was able to provide a balanced \r\nanalysis and a set of recommendations that should \r\nbe carefully examined. That was made possible, in \r\nparticular, by extensive consultations among all of the \r\nstakeholders involved in peace operations, including \r\nMember States.\r\nSwitzerland also welcomes the report of the \r\nSecretary-General, which further elaborates the \r\nfundamental challenges that often significantly impede \r\nthe effective functioning of peacekeeping operations \r\nand special political missions, which include, inter alia, \r\nthe lack of resources in certain areas and the lack of \r\nadequate structures and procedures. We welcome the \r\nconclusion of the Secretary-General expressed in his \r\nthree priorities. They pave the way forward for both \r\npolitical solutions and improved administration.\r\n15-30802 29/29\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.29\r\nTo implement the recommendations effectively, it \r\nis advisable to develop a road map that appropriately \r\nsets out the tasks of the various United Nations bodies, \r\nincluding the Secretariat, and the areas of responsibility \r\nof the Security Council and Member States in the \r\nimplementation of the recommendations. Such a road \r\nmap would outline the various stages of implementation \r\nof the recommendations.\r\nIn that context, Switzerland shares the view \r\nexpressed in the report that only a joint approach \r\nwill lead to the effective implementation of the \r\nrecommendations. Indeed, no single entity will be able \r\nto address the current challenges to peace and security. \r\nClose cooperation throughout the United Nations \r\nsystem and the establishment of ongoing partnerships \r\nbetween the various competent agencies and actors is \r\nessential.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
