Let me also express our \r\ngratitude to the High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeace Operations for its comprehensive and inclusive \r\nreview (see A/70/95), and the Secretary-General for \r\nhis valuable report (A/70/357) on the future of peace \r\noperations.\r\nTurkey aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe observer of the European Union this morning (see \r\nA/70/PV.29).\r\nToday, we are confronted with increasingly complex \r\nchallenges to international peace and security, which \r\nsurpass the individual response capacity of any one \r\nMember State. The transnational threats against \r\nMember States, especially terrorism, constitute the \r\nmajor challenge in that regard.\r\nThe latest terrorist bombings in Turkey have been \r\na stark reminder of that threat. I would like to express \r\nour sincere gratitude to you, Mr. President, and to those \r\nwho expressed their solidarity after those heinous \r\nterrorist attacks.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, we must acknowledge that \r\nthe United Nations is also facing difficulties. We are \r\naware that some of the difficulties that the United \r\nNations is currently encountering stem not only from \r\ninadequate resources or organizational problems, but \r\nalso from the deficit in political will among Member \r\nStates for undertaking the necessary reforms. We must \r\ntherefore adopt more effective strategies in order to \r\nstrengthen our collective response capability without \r\nprejudice to the traditional bedrock principles of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn that sense, both the key findings and the \r\nrecommendations of the High-level Panel’s review \r\nand the road map set out in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport need to be thoroughly examined, as they offer \r\nclear guidance on a number of cross-cutting issues. \r\nMoreover, taken together with other review processes, \r\nnotably the review of the peacebuilding architecture \r\nand the global study on resolution 1325 (2000), the \r\noverlapping findings of those reports may serve as an \r\neffective remedy for the long-standing problems in the \r\nUnited Nations peace and security architecture.\r\nWe acknowledge the importance of peacekeeping \r\noperations, as they have become the f lagship activity \r\nof the United Nations, and we concur with the idea that \r\nmore has to be done to improve the effectiveness of \r\nthose peacekeeping missions. We should devote more \r\nenergy and, if necessary, more resources to that end, if \r\nwe really want to live up to our commitmentsvis-à-vis \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.30\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n30th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 12 October 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/14 15-31011\r\nA/70/PV.30 12/10/2015\r\nthe protection of civilians and human rights. With that \r\nunderstanding, Turkey made a new and solid pledge, \r\nin addition to its existing contributions, to support \r\npeacekeeping missions at the leaders’ summit on \r\npeacekeeping operations on 28 September.\r\nOn the other hand, as one of the Co-Chairs of the \r\nGroup of Friends of Mediation, we would also like to see \r\nthe United Nations pay more attention to the growing \r\nneed for effective mediation and conflict prevention. \r\nThat would be the natural outcome of the primacy that \r\nthe review of peace operations attributed to political \r\nengagement. The entire United Nations membership \r\nand its principal organs should see that obvious linkage \r\nas the crux of both the High-level Panel’s and the \r\nSecretary-General’s messages, if we really want to go \r\nbeyond the narrow perspective of crisis management in \r\nan age where crises are turning out to be more and more \r\nunmanageable. At the sixth ministerial meeting of the \r\nGroup of Friends of Mediation, which took place two \r\nweeks ago, we reaffirmed our commitment to address \r\nthat need.\r\nIn line with that approach, I want to touch very \r\nbriefly on special political missions. Such missions \r\nshould be seen as key mechanisms, given their proven \r\nrelevance and cost effectiveness in the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts and the prevention of the relapse \r\ninto crises. Let me therefore reiterate Turkey’s firm \r\nconviction that adequate funding for special political \r\nmissions, as well as a clear-cut definition of their \r\nmandates in any transitional process, must be ensured \r\nin order to strengthen their performance.\r\nFully aware of the divergent opinions among \r\nMember States, we acknowledge the difficulties \r\nimpeding concerted action, even in efforts merely to \r\nprocedurally advance that agenda. However, we believe \r\nthat it would be a big missed opportunity if the reports \r\nin question were not given due attention and if they \r\nsimply faded away owing to inaction. To the contrary, \r\ngiven the genuine interest among Member States, their \r\nconsensual elements must be further examined with a \r\nsense of ownership. To that end, I would like to express \r\nTurkey’s readiness to support any course of action that \r\nwill generate consensus.\r\nMr. Sauer (Finland): Finland aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made earlier today by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union (see A/70/PV.29).\r\nToday we have before us the excellent report of the \r\nHigh-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations (see \r\nA/70/95), led by the former President of Timor-Leste, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. José Ramos-Horta, as well as the \r\nfollow-up report of the Secretary-General (A/70/357). \r\nFifteen years ago, the Brahimi report (see A/55/305) \r\nintroduced the concept of integrated peacekeeping \r\noperations, thereby changing the very nature of \r\npeacekeeping. Now Mr. Ramos-Horta and his High-\r\nlevel Panel are again shifting the United Nations peace \r\nand security landscape by elevating conflict prevention \r\nand political operations to the fore, together with \r\npeacekeeping. We welcome that timely approach. We \r\nalso commend the Secretary-General for appointing the \r\nHigh-level Panel to assist peace operations, not merely \r\npeacekeeping.\r\nThe key observation of the Ramos-Horta Panel \r\nis the paradigm change. First, politics have primacy \r\nand we must not lose sight of the search for political \r\nsolutions. Secondly, conflict prevention and mediation \r\nmust be given renewed focus in United Nations peace \r\noperations.\r\nNow we need to translate the findings of the High-\r\nlevel Panel into practice. In doing so, we wish to recall \r\ntwo existing tools in the United Nations peace and \r\nsecurity toolkit, namely, special political missions and \r\nmediation. Special political missions have become an \r\nintegral part of United Nations efforts to build and \r\nmaintain peace. However, they lack the financial and \r\nadministrative support needed to ensure the full use \r\nof their potential. We have to adopt a comprehensive \r\nand balanced consensus solution to such problems. The \r\nUnited Nations also needs more sustainable and reliable \r\nresourcing for its core mediation activities. Investing \r\nin prevention and mediation is a wise investment. A \r\ndime spent on prevention today can save us a dollar \r\nin peacekeeping in the future. Even more important \r\nare the lives that effective prevention and mediation \r\nefforts can save. We also have to work to strengthen \r\npartnerships in the field of mediation.\r\nI would also like to stress the obvious need for \r\nthe participation of women in peace processes and \r\npeace operations. That is not just a question of gender \r\nequality; there is undisputed evidence that women’s \r\nparticipation contributes to the sustainability of peace.\r\nIn our view, the protection of civilians is clearly a \r\ncore task in peacekeeping. United Nations peacekeepers \r\nmust be ready and able to engage in robust action and \r\nuse force, if that is needed, to protect innocent civilians \r\nand prevent further casualties. We need better planning \r\nand analysis, support for force-generation processes, \r\n15-31011 3/14\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.30\r\ntraining and clear command structures. Support \r\npractices need to be more field-focused, so as to ensure \r\nthe effective delivery of mandated tasks. The use of \r\nmodern technology can help to protect civilians and \r\nimprove the safety of troops. In rapidly changing and \r\nchallenging conflict situations, we need to find more \r\nagile, effective and innovative ways of doing business. \r\nFuture operations should be more nimble and f lexible, \r\ndiverse and limited in length.\r\nThe recent cases of sexual exploitation and \r\nabuse have cast a shadow on the United Nations. It is \r\nunacceptable that those who wear the United Nations \r\ncolours — civilian or military — abuse the people \r\nthey are sent to protect. Both the United Nations and \r\nits Member States must take more robust measures to \r\ntackle such cases and make the zero-tolerance policy \r\ninto a zero-case reality. We commend both reports for \r\naddressing that issue.\r\nThe three ongoing reviews of peace operations, \r\npeacebuilding and Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) offer us an excellent opportunity to rethink the \r\nUnited Nations peace and security architecture. That \r\nopportunity should be seized, and we need to strive for \r\ncoherent implementation.\r\nThe United Nations, with its structures and tools \r\nand with its legitimacy, is uniquely positioned to \r\nplay a central role in sustaining peace and preventing \r\nhuman suffering through its peace operations. It is \r\nimportant now to sustain the momentum gained in the \r\npeace operations review and to advance the process \r\nfurther, with a view to reaching results that can be put \r\nin practice. That calls for leadership from the current \r\nand future Secretaries-General and a sense of common \r\npurpose from his or her departments. It also calls for \r\nstrong political commitment from Member States.\r\nMr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We have studied with interest the conclusions \r\nand work of the High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeace Operations (see A/70/95), led by His Excellency \r\nMr. Ramos-Horta, on the activities of peacekeeping \r\noperations and special political missions, as well \r\nas the recommendations that the Secretary-General \r\nhas provided in that regard. We think that document \r\nwill set the tone for developments in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping, including within the conceptual and \r\noperational spheres.\r\nWe share the conclusions of the High-level Panel \r\nthat, in order to fully realize the potential and to improve \r\nthe effectiveness of United Nations missions, we must \r\nhave reform in four areas. First, we must strengthen \r\nthe political tools for resolving crisis situations. \r\nSecondly, we must define the forms of United Nations \r\nintervention, be it peacekeeping operations or special \r\npolitical missions, depending on the situation in each \r\nspecific country. Thirdly, we must strengthen global \r\nand regional cooperation in the maintenance of peace \r\nand security. Fourthly, we must reinforce the missions’ \r\nfocus on the interests and needs of the populations in \r\nthe countries where they are deployed through closer \r\ndialogue with local communities.\r\nWe share the High-level Panel’s recommendations \r\non the need to use political dialogue as a priority \r\nmeasure in settling conflict situations and on the \r\nimportance of strengthening regional mechanisms for \r\nsettling crises. In modern times, it is necessary to also \r\ntake into account the regional dimension of conflicts \r\nand the transnational nature of the threat when an \r\noutbreak of violence in one country threatens to spill \r\nover into neighbouring States, or even into the whole \r\nregion. In that context, it is important to develop a \r\nformat for cooperation among the countries of a region, \r\nas well as with regional and subregional organizations, \r\nincluding exchanging information and best practices \r\nand providing resources with a view to ensuring quick \r\nand effective responses to existing and emerging \r\nchallenges.\r\nIt is encouraging that the High-level Panel’s report \r\nhas confirmed the traditional principles of United \r\nNations peacekeeping, but we cannot agree with the \r\nneed, posited in the report, for f lexible interpretations \r\ndepending on the changing circumstances on the ground, \r\nabove all in the context of the possible use of force by the \r\nBlue Helmets. Furthermore, we fully agree that United \r\nNations peacekeeping forces should never be used for \r\ncombating terrorism or violent extremism. However, \r\nwe believe that the set of issues relating to preventive \r\nmeasures, the principles of peacekeeping, the structural \r\nchanges in the Secretariat and financial aspects require \r\nextremely close attention and substantive consideration \r\nby Member States, in particular within the framework \r\nof the Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations \r\nand the Fifth Committee.\r\nWe cannot allow a reduction in the role of Member \r\nStates with regard to United Nations peacekeeping \r\nreform. That also applies to the use and reallocation \r\nof human and financial resources, where a lack of \r\noversight by Member States could lead to a weakening \r\n4/14 15-31011\r\nA/70/PV.30 12/10/2015\r\nof budgetary transparency and discipline and could \r\nnegatively impact the quality of the delivery of Security \r\nCouncil mandates and the principles of neutrality and \r\nimpartiality in the provision of services by the United \r\nNations.\r\nWe believe that it is also important to maintain \r\na balanced approach and restrain the excessive focus \r\non human rights issues, including references to the \r\nSecretary-General’s Human Rights Up Front initiative, \r\nand to gender issues. In that connection, there is \r\nnothing to be gained from artificially narrowing the \r\ncircle of troop- and police-contributing countries, \r\nunder various pretexts, including accusations of human \r\nrights violations. We must also approach with caution \r\nthe proposal to give the Secretariat broader powers \r\nin its recruitment policy, including with regard to \r\nrapid deployment and the administration of civilian \r\npersonnel.\r\nWe remain convinced that the United Nations \r\npresence, regardless of what form it takes, must \r\nbe of a supportive nature and provide assistance \r\nto host countries on the basis of the priorities set by \r\nhost Governments themselves. In that context, it is \r\nimperative to establish constructive daily cooperation \r\nbetween peacekeepers and local authorities and to \r\nprovide capacity-building support to host States.\r\nWith regard to improving strategic planning during \r\nthe deployment of United Nations missions, we would \r\nlike to note that, although the High-level Panel’s report \r\nand the Secretary-General’s recommendations do not \r\nspecifically refer to the Military Staff Committee, \r\nwe believe that stepping up that body’s activities and \r\nconducting systematic analysis of the military-political \r\nsituations in problematic regions of the world could \r\nsignificantly increase the level of the Security Council’s \r\nmilitary expertise.\r\nWe intend, for our part, to thoroughly analyse \r\nand discuss in detail in intergovernmental forums the \r\nrecommendations of the Secretary-General, including \r\non such issues as improving command and control \r\nfunctions, discipline and logistical support.\r\nMr. Alemu (Ethiopia): At the outset, I would like to \r\nthank you, Mr. President, for convening this debate on \r\nthe review report of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations (see A/70/95) and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s implementation report (A/70/357). Let me \r\ntake this opportunity to express my appreciation to \r\nthe Secretary-General for taking the initiative to \r\nappoint the High-level Panel to review peacekeeping \r\noperations in all their aspects. That was indeed timely \r\nand important in the light of the changing political and \r\nsecurity dynamics and the need to make peacekeeping \r\noperations fit for purpose.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the remarks \r\ndelivered by the representative of Sierra Leone on \r\nbehalf of the African States and by the representative \r\nof Morocco on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement \r\n(see A/70/PV.29).\r\nWe are pleased to note that the High-level Panel \r\nconducted wide-ranging consultations, both in New \r\nYork and in various corners of the world, to engage \r\nMember States and other relevant stakeholders. It is \r\nin that context that consultations also took place at the \r\nheadquarters of the African Union in Addis Ababa. \r\nNo doubt, strengthening the cooperation and \r\npartnership between the United Nations and the African \r\nUnion in the area of peacekeeping is absolutely critical, \r\nas most of the United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nare deployed in the African continent. That is why \r\nAfrica came up with a common position on the review, \r\nand we are happy that the High-level Panel seriously \r\ntook into account the views and concerns of Africa \r\nas reflected in our common position. We commend \r\nthe Chair of the High-level Panel, His Excellency \r\nformer President José Ramos Horta of Timor-Leste, \r\nand the members of the Panel for their hard work and \r\nthe important recommendations they have made to \r\nstrengthen United Nations peacekeeping operations in \r\nall their aspects. They did so in a wise and balanced \r\nmanner, taking into account the various views and \r\nconcerns of Member States.\r\nThe implementation of those recommendations is the \r\nkey to achieving the objective of strengthening United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations in a comprehensive \r\nmanner. Accordingly, we find ourselves at an important \r\njuncture in the evolution of the role played by the United \r\nNations in discharging its responsibilities for regional \r\nand global peace and security. That is why we thank the \r\nSecretary-General for presenting his implementation \r\nreport, which should be considered holistically together \r\nwith the High-level Panel’s report.\r\nNot only are we considering the review and the \r\nimplementation report 15 years after the Brahimi report \r\n(see A/55/305) and at a time when we are marking the \r\nseventieth anniversary of our Organization, but we \r\nare also doing so at a very opportune time in that we \r\n15-31011 5/14\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.30\r\nhave entered into a morally binding commitment to \r\neradicate extreme poverty in 15 years and to be faithful \r\nto a transformative agenda, which is embodied in the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1).\r\nThere is no better way to lay a firm foundation for \r\nthe realization of the 2030 Agenda than to carry forward \r\nthe reform of United Nations peace operations. Peace \r\nand development can never be conceived separately, as \r\nthe history of Africa, including that of my own country, \r\nEthiopia, makes abundantly clear, as neither can \r\nsucceed without respect for human rights. However, \r\nthey must not be politicized. Double standards will \r\nnever help us to make progress in any area. They will \r\nonly impede what we need most, namely, the building \r\nof mutual trust and mutual confidence.\r\nIn conclusion, permit me to say that we have \r\nbeen encouraged by what we witnessed during the \r\nsummit on peacekeeping, where Member States made \r\nstrong commitments to strengthen United Nations \r\npeacekeeping. We need to sustain that momentum as \r\nwe embark on the important phase of implementation. \r\nIt is in that spirit that we look forward to the discussion \r\nthat will take place in the various intergovernmental \r\ncommittees to examine the reports of the High-level \r\nPanel and of the Sectary-General.\r\nMr. Bosah (Nigeria): The Nigerian delegation \r\ncongratulates you, Mr. President, on your election to \r\nsteer the affairs of the General Assembly in this historic \r\nperiod marking the seventieth year of the inception of \r\nthe United Nations. We commend your initiative to \r\nconvene this meeting, which affords us an opportunity \r\nto share views on strengthening the United Nations \r\nsystem.\r\nWe are especially thankful for the presentation by \r\nthe Secretary-General (see A/70/PV.29) of his report \r\n(A/70/357) containing his proposals for implementing \r\nthe recommendations of the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations. The insights that his \r\npresentation has afforded us bears out the wisdom and \r\nimportance of this discourse.\r\nAt the outset, let me state that Nigeria aligns \r\nitself with the statements made this morning by the \r\nrepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the African \r\nStates and by the representative of Morocco on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement (see A/70/PV.29).\r\nAs we take stock of the activities and reflect on \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations to meet the challenges \r\nconfronting the global community, we note the innovative \r\nevents coinciding with the seventieth anniversary of the \r\ninception of the United Nations. Those events include \r\nthe transition from the Millennium Development Goals \r\nto the post-2015 development agenda, as set out in the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), the proposals for the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly and the reform of the Security Council and \r\nthe review of the United Nations peace operations and \r\nthe peacebuilding architecture.\r\nI would like to share our perspective on the \r\nrecent review of United Nations peace operations \r\nundertaken by the High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeace Operations. That review is opportune given the \r\nincreased number of conflicts and new challenges in \r\npeacekeeping since the last significant assessment of \r\nUnited Nations peace operations was conducted in \r\n2000 under the chairmanship of Lakhdar Brahimi of \r\nAlgeria. We commend the extensive consultations \r\nundertaken by the High-level Panel, which has led to \r\nthe broad acceptance of its report (see A/70/95).\r\nEfforts to meet the new challenges facing United \r\nNations peace operations should draw from the array \r\nof suggestions raised in the High-level Panel’s report, \r\nincluding lessons learned from past and present \r\npeacekeeping operations. The ultimate goal should be to \r\ncreate resilience by identifying the conditions for peace \r\noperations that will effectively meet the challenges on \r\nthe ground.\r\nAs the majority of United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations have been deployed in Africa, Nigeria \r\nwelcomes the High-level Panel’s recommendations \r\naimed at enhancing the cooperative relationship \r\nbetween the United Nations and the African Union \r\n(AU). Partnership is indeed the cornerstone of Africa’s \r\neffort to stabilize its vast region and shoulder its share \r\nof the global responsibility to maintain peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nIt is important to highlight the funding challenges \r\nfacing the African Union, as well as the need for the \r\nUnited Nations to assume the primary responsibility \r\nfor the African Union-led operations initiated as \r\nbridging measures. That should not be misunderstood \r\nas unwillingness on the part of the African Union \r\nto manage its own operations. Rather, it is an \r\nacknowledgement that today’s armed conflicts require \r\ncomplex, nuanced and often high-technology responses \r\nthat demand a particular level of infrastructure that the \r\nAU simply cannot afford. The need for support does not \r\n6/14 15-31011\r\nA/70/PV.30 12/10/2015\r\namount to dependency. Instead, it must be viewed as \r\na vital partnership in the global quest for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the High-level Panel’s \r\nrecommendations regarding the use of United Nations-\r\nassessed contributions on a case-by-case basis to \r\nsupport Security Council-authorized African Union \r\nsupport operations, including the costs associated with \r\ndeployed uniformed personnel to complement funding \r\nfrom the African Union and/or African Member States. \r\nWe also welcome the Secretary-General’s decision \r\nto prioritize the implementation of the High-level \r\nPanel’s recommendation regarding the development \r\nof stronger regional-global partnerships. That will \r\nrequire improving institutional collaboration between \r\nthe United Nations and the AU by going beyond \r\ncontext-specific to more predictable mechanisms for \r\ncooperation between the two organizations. African \r\nnations can, and should, leverage the reforms to create \r\nthe requisite stability and social order and to advance \r\ntheir developmental goals.\r\nSignificant importance has been given to the \r\nprotection of civilians in conflict areas. However, \r\nthe different operating methods of the mission \r\ncomponents — military, police and civilian — involved \r\nin the protection of civilians in conflict environments \r\nraise a number of issues. The autonomy to act and make \r\ndecisions differs greatly among the components in the \r\nlight of their different mandates, standard operational \r\nprocedures, agendas and rules of engagement. Hence, \r\nthere is the crucial need for strategic coordination \r\namong the various mission components for effective \r\ndelivery on the protection-of-civilians mandate. \r\nThat can be achieved through the development of \r\ncomprehensive training on strategic coordination for \r\nthe protection of civilians for all mission components. \r\nIt is also expedient that greater attention be given to \r\ncoherence among mission components.\r\nWe welcome the High-level Panel’s suggestions \r\nunderscoring the significance of protective measures to \r\nbe adopted by local communities for the protection of \r\nvulnerable persons in conflict zones. We call for the \r\ndevelopment of strategies that reinforce those efforts \r\nand ensure that national institutions are empowered to \r\nenable the discharge of their primary responsibility to \r\nstrengthen security and the rule of law in post-conflict \r\nareas.\r\nThe tenuous stability and evolution in many post-\r\nconflict States underscore the need for invigorated \r\nefforts and concrete measures to prevent a relapse into \r\ncrisis. In that regard, we appreciate the significance of \r\nthe continued reforms undertaken by the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission to ensure stability in post-conflict \r\nsettings. The 2015 review process would benefit from \r\ntaking note of the peacebuilding efforts in Africa. \r\nLessons may be drawn from the accomplishments in \r\nreforms in the security sector and the justice sector, \r\nfood security, domestic resource mobilization, the \r\ncurbing of illicit financial f lows and the negotiation of \r\nbalanced natural-resource contracts.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Nigeria’s abiding \r\ncommitment to the tenets of the United Nations and its \r\npersustent efforts towards ensuring global peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Dalo (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nthank the Secretary-General for presenting his report \r\n(A/70/357) on the implementation of the measures set \r\nout in the report of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations (see A/70/95). We hope to have \r\nan opportunity to discuss those reports together in the \r\nframework of the discussions in the Fourth Committee, \r\nand in particular in the Special Committee on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations, and in the Fifth Committee \r\nwith regard to their administrative and budgetary \r\naspects.\r\nArgentina welcomes the recommendations contained \r\nin the report of the High-level Panel, led by His \r\nExcellency Mr. José Ramos-Horta. While we may \r\ndiffer on certain points, we recognize that they are \r\npart of a balanced perspective reflecting the differing \r\npositions taken by the various parties with regard to \r\nthe many topics covered by peacekeeping operations \r\nand special political missions, defined as a whole as \r\npeace operations. With that in mind, we underscore \r\nthe scope of the consultations that were held and the \r\nindependence and intellectual honesty that the High-\r\nlevel Panel’s members and the Secretariat team have \r\nshown, and we congratulate them on their important \r\nwork.\r\nThe High-level Panel’s report is extensive and \r\nspecific on each of the issues that it deals with, so I will \r\nrefer only briefly to some issues to which my country \r\nattaches particular importance.\r\nFirst, we agree with the general perspective of the \r\nreport aimed at giving greater importance to conflict \r\nprevention, mediation and the use of political tools in \r\nthe design and implementation of peacekeeping tools. In \r\n15-31011 7/14\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.30\r\nthat connection, the Secretariat’s efforts for prevention \r\nand mediation should be strengthened through a better \r\nallocation of resources in the regular budget.\r\nMoreover, we thank the High-level Panel for \r\nhaving assumed the responsibility of addressing the \r\ndelicate issue of the use of force in peacekeeping \r\noperations. We believe that the three key principles \r\nof such operations — the consent of the parties, \r\nimpartiality, and the use of force in self-defence and \r\nto defend the mandate — should continue to be the \r\nguide for the success of the missions, without being an \r\nobstacle to acting, in extreme cases, for the protection \r\nof civilians and to defend the mission. In that context, \r\na clear understanding of the rules of engagement and \r\na deepening of the triangular cooperation among \r\nthe Security Council, the Secretariat and the troop- \r\nand police-contributing countries are essential. We \r\nalso emphasize that extreme caution must be used in \r\nassigning exceptional peace-enforcement tasks to \r\npeacekeeping operations, as we are aware that they \r\nwere not designed or trained for such purposes. We \r\nalso agree with the High-level Panel that peacekeeping \r\noperations should not be involved in counterterrorism \r\ntasks.\r\nAnother area in which the High-level Panel \r\nhas made a valuable contribution is the protection \r\nof civilians in peacekeeping operations. There was \r\nagreement not to consider that issue from a purely \r\nmilitary perspective, but from a broader political \r\nand humanitarian perspective focused on creating an \r\natmosphere of safety and security in which force would \r\nbe used only in extreme cases to avoid a repetition of \r\nsad experiences such as those of Srebrenica or Rwanda, \r\nand as a last resort following the failure of other \r\nnon-military alternatives. We share the High-level \r\nPanel’s recommendation aimed at giving top priority \r\nto strategies not requiring force for the protection of \r\ncivilians, and we underscore the need to work together \r\nwith the authorities of host States and with humanitarian \r\norganizations, which are carrying out important work \r\non the ground. Furthermore, in line with the High-level \r\nPanel, we assert that the delicate task of the protection of \r\ncivilians by participating contingents in peacekeeping \r\nmissions requires special training and equipment, for \r\nwhich appropriate financial resources are required.\r\nMy delegation attaches vital importance to the task \r\nof promoting and protecting human rights, since we \r\nare dealing with an increasing number of peacekeeping \r\noperations. We agree with the High-level Panel’s \r\nrecommendations regarding the integration of human \r\nrights concerns into such missions, in particular so that \r\nthe Secretariat can have resources to recruit and deploy \r\nspecialized personnel in the field during the early \r\nstages of the missions to provide support to the human \r\nrights components and special envoys.\r\nWe also support all measures aimed at implementing \r\nthe agenda on women and peace and security, pursuant \r\nto Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), and at \r\nstrengthening measures to combat cases of sexual \r\nabuse and exploitation in peacekeeping operations.\r\nFinally, I wish to address the issue of the financing \r\nof special political missions. It is worth remembering \r\nthat both the Secretariat and the Advisory Committee \r\non Administrative and Budgetary Questions have \r\nrecommended timely measures to improve the funding \r\narrangements and support from Headquarters, \r\nincluding the establishment of a specific and separate \r\nfund for special political missions. We welcome the \r\nHigh-level Panel’s recommendation, also contained \r\nin the Secretary-General’s report, calling for the \r\nimmediate implementation of those measures, which \r\nwill increase the efficiency and transparency of the \r\nbudgetary process of the entire Organization, not only \r\nfor the missions referred to.\r\nI conclude by emphasizing once again the work \r\naccomplished by the High-level Panel and the relevance \r\nof its recommendations. The responsibility now falls \r\nupon us, the Member States, with the Secretariat’s \r\nassistance, to work in harmony and transform those \r\nrecommendations into concrete measures that will \r\nachieve effective results for the work of the 120,000 \r\npeacekeepers, various personnel and the special \r\npolitical missions on the ground and, above all, in \r\nshaping the reality and the destiny of the countries \r\nwhere they are deployed.\r\nMr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): The United \r\nKingdom is committed to supporting the United Nations \r\npeace operations architecture. I hope that we can all \r\nwork together to ensure the continual improvements \r\nin the United Nations ability to deliver in this crucial \r\nfield. \r\nThe demand for effective United Nations peace \r\noperations has never been greater. That is why the \r\nUnited Kingdom warmly welcomed the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s announcement last year of an independent \r\npanel to conduct a comprehensive review of United \r\nNations peace operations. The review has been an \r\n8/14 15-31011\r\nA/70/PV.30 12/10/2015\r\nimmensely valuable exercise. We commend the report of \r\nthe High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations \r\n(see A/70/95) and welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nresponse (A/70/357). We must take the opportunity now \r\nto push ahead with the vital reforms outlined.\r\nSome of the recommendations in the report may \r\nincrease the United Nations peacekeeping budget. We \r\nare prepared to pay more for better peacekeeping, but \r\nwe must avoid duplication, streamline processes and \r\nsharpen mandates. Peace operations must be efficient \r\nand effective. The United Kingdom has three priorities \r\nfor reform, and we want to see rapid action on each of \r\nthem. \r\nFirst is better protection of civilians. We need more \r\ntransparency and accountability where missions have \r\nfailed to protect civilians, so that we can learn from our \r\nmistakes and ensure that missions have the capabilities \r\nand the training to deliver. We support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s intentions to initiate regular reporting to the \r\nSecurity Council on risks posed to civilians and on \r\nany capability gaps that might impede the protection \r\nof civilians. We support full disclosure to the Council \r\nof protection-of-civilian failures, and we support \r\nthe appointment of protection-of-civilian advisers in \r\nmissions.\r\nWe were pleased to see the prominence given  to \r\nwomen and peace and security, especially as we look \r\nforward to tomorrow’s high-level review in the Security \r\nCouncil. We must ensure that women are part of political \r\nand protection solutions. This is not about sectioning \r\noff women’s issues and placing them in a separate \r\ncategory when managing or addressing conflict; it is \r\nabout an integrated approach. We therefore endorse the \r\nSecretary-General’s call for all senior United Nations \r\nstaff to have specific job-performance indicators \r\non gender and on women and peace and security, \r\nagainst which they should be held accountable. We \r\nalso encourage the Secretariat to establish immediate \r\nresponse teams to gather and preserve evidence of \r\nsexual exploitation and abuse for use in investigations, \r\nwhich should be completed within six months. On that \r\nnote, we fully support the Secretary-General’s position \r\non the recent allegations of sexual exploitation and \r\nabuse. States must take action. Zero tolerance means \r\nzero tolerance.\r\nOur second priority is better planning of missions \r\nand more targeted and focused mandating. The United \r\nKingdom is committed to supporting the Secretariat in \r\nimproving the way missions are planned and deployed. \r\nWe are encouraged by the Secretary-General’s plans to \r\nestablish a new strategic analysis and planning capacity. \r\nThat unit will draw together expertise across the \r\nSecretariat and offer the strategic planning focal point \r\nthat United Nations peace operations need. We must get \r\nbetter at understanding the situation on the ground, and \r\nwe must be clear on what we want and on what we can \r\nachieve before we start mandating new missions. We \r\nmust heed the advice that peace operations are led from \r\nthe field and that policies and processes support that \r\napproach rather than work against it.\r\nOur third priority is a more strategic approach \r\nto force generation. The United Kingdom supports \r\ncalls for a more f lexible approach to deployments, \r\nembracing offers of specific technical assistance from \r\nMember States. As my Prime Minister, David Cameron, \r\nannounced at the leaders’ summit on peacekeeping, \r\nthe United Kingdom will make additional military \r\ndeployments to the United Nations Support Office for \r\nthe African Union Mission in Somalia and the United \r\nNations Mission in South Sudan. Those pledges are \r\npart of the United Kingdom’s commitment to playing \r\na greater role in supporting United Nations peace \r\noperations. We also fully endorse the establishment of \r\nthe Strategic Force Generation and Capability Planning \r\nCell in the Department of Peacekeeping Operations. \r\nThe United Kingdom has provided donor support to \r\nthe Cell and would encourage other Member States to \r\ndo likewise. Following the many generous pledges we \r\nheard last week, there is much work for the new Cell to \r\ndo so as to ensure that there is a smooth transition from \r\npledges to deployments.\r\nOur top three priorities are, then, the protection of \r\ncivilians, planning and mandating, and force generation. \r\nI would like to conclude by noting the great work \r\ndone by the more than 100,000 peacekeepers and \r\nmission staff across the world and by honouring the \r\nsacrifices that so many have made in the quest for \r\npeace. Let us work together to make United Nations \r\npeace operations the best that they can be. The United \r\nKingdom is ready and willing to play its part.\r\nMr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): My delegation \r\nthanks the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening this timely debate. We also thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his comprehensive briefing this \r\nmorning (see A/70/PV.29), as well as for his report \r\n(A/70/357), which has set out an agenda for the future \r\n15-31011 9/14\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.30\r\nof United Nations peace operations, based on the \r\nrecommendations of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations (see A/70/95)\r\nThe Republic of Korea shares the view, set out in \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report, that the world today \r\nurgently needs new and stronger ways to address the \r\ninternational peace and security challenges. We strongly \r\nsupport the idea that, when designed and conducted \r\nin more people-focused and targeted ways — in \r\nother words, fit for purpose — United Nations peace \r\noperations can make a significant contribution to \r\naddressing the ever more complex challenges facing the \r\ninternational community. As a Member State that was \r\naided by United Nations forces when our own peace and \r\nsecurity were threatened 65 years ago, the Republic of \r\nKorea is fully committed to maintaining international \r\npeace and security together with United Nations peace \r\noperations.\r\nIn that vein, we are a consistent supporter of United \r\nNations peace operations around the world today, in terms \r\nof both troop deployment and financial contributions to \r\nthe budget for peacekeeping operations. The Republic \r\nof Korea is a member of the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nthrough which our contribution to conflict prevention \r\ncontinues to increase. Two weeks ago, my President \r\nparticipated in the leaders’ summit on peacekeeping \r\nand made pledges to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, including a new assistance package to the \r\nAfrican Union to enhance its peacekeeping capacities.\r\nRegarding the aforementioned report of the \r\nSecretary-General on United Nations peace operations, \r\nwe believe that it will be essential for Member States to \r\nsustain the political momentum for the implementation \r\nof the recommendations made in the reports, as well \r\nas to build on synergies with the parallel reviews on \r\npeacebuilding architecture and the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and \r\npeace and security. \r\nTo that end, I am happy to inform the Assembly \r\nthat the Republic of Korea is organizing an expert \r\nmeeting in Seoul later this month to develop and refine \r\na practical and shared understanding of key aspects \r\nof the reform agenda with regard to peace operations \r\nand to start thinking about a way forward for its \r\nimplementation. We hope that that meeting will make a \r\nmeaningful contribution to the ongoing discussions on \r\npeace operations for the remainder of this year.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): Denmark aligns itself \r\nwith the statement made by the observer of the European \r\nUnion earlier today (see A/70/PV.29). Please allow me \r\nto make a few additional comments.\r\nIn today’s world, the need for strong and effective \r\nUnited Nations peace operations has never been greater, \r\nand Denmark welcomes the review of such operations \r\ninitiated by the Secretary-General last year. Denmark \r\nfully supports the report of the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations (see A/70/95) and the \r\nSecretary-General’s report on the implementation of \r\nthe High-level Panel’s recommendations (A/70/357). \r\nCombined, the reports represent a very timely, \r\ncomprehensive and relevant basis for reforming and \r\nstrengthening our common efforts at a time when we \r\nare faced with ever more complex security crises and \r\nthreats. To counter those growing challenges, more \r\nneeds to be done. United Nations peace operations \r\nremain absolutely essential in the world of today. \r\nCoherence must be a guiding principle in our reform \r\neffort. The peace operations review must be seen in \r\nconnection with the review of the implementation of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000), on women and \r\npeace and security and the peacebuilding architecture \r\nreview (see A/69/968).\r\nSupport for United Nations peace operations has \r\nbeen and will continue to be a central pillar of Denmark’s \r\nforeign policy. We have been actively participating in \r\nseveral United Nations peace operations as well as in \r\ncapacity-building missions in countries affected by \r\nconflict and fragility. Our development cooperation \r\nseeks to contribute to stability and development and \r\nthus ultimately to prevent conflicts from evolving in \r\nthe first place. \r\nDuring the high-level thematic debate on the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security two \r\nweeks ago, my Government announced its intention \r\nto make a number of new commitments to supporting \r\nUnited Nations peace operations.\r\nFirst, we have offered to deploy a military \r\ncontribution to the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) \r\nin order to address critical shortfalls there, as well as a \r\npolice contribution to the same force of up to 12 officers. \r\nDenmark is also planning to make a $3 million \r\ncontribution to trust funds managed by MINUSMA \r\naimed at facilitating, among other things, the provision \r\nof quick impact projects for the population. Secondly, \r\n10/14 15-31011\r\nA/70/PV.30 12/10/2015\r\nwe have offered to make a contribution of $1.5 million \r\ntowards improving and strengthening United Nations \r\nefforts to protect civilians in peace operations, including \r\npredeployment training of troops focused on effective \r\nmandate implementation. Thirdly, we have offered a \r\ncore contribution of $2.7 million to the Department of \r\nPolitical Affairs for the next three-year period.\r\nDenmark fully agrees with the High-level Panel \r\nand the Secretary-General that the United Nations role \r\nin conflict prevention, mediation and the provision of \r\npolitical solutions to conflicts must be strengthened \r\nas an integral element in a coherent United Nations \r\napproach to peace operations.\r\nWe fully support the Secretary-General’s call for \r\nthe General Assembly to take early action in response \r\nto the report’s recommendations. In our work over the \r\ncoming months, our ultimate goal must be to ensure \r\nthat the United Nations can effectively provide security \r\nin the world of today. That means ensuring that the \r\nUnited Nations has the right instruments at its disposal \r\nfor addressing today’s difficult security situation. \r\nWe must take an honest look at the shortcomings \r\nand inefficiencies of the current peace and security \r\narchitecture and carry forward bold and ambitious \r\nreforms.\r\nMr. Makharoblishvili (Georgia): Georgia welcomes \r\nthe report of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace \r\nOperations (see A/70/95) as a timely effort to provide \r\na comprehensive assessment of the United Nations \r\nexperience in peace operations. We hope that today’s \r\ndiscussion will make a positive contribution to the \r\nsuccessful streamlining of the United Nations peace \r\noperations agenda.\r\nGeorgia experienced the unfortunate termination \r\nof the United Nations Observer Mission in Georgia \r\n(UNOMIG), which played a crucial role in maintaining \r\npeace and stability in the Georgian region of Abkhazia, \r\nby a single veto exercised by a permanent member of \r\nthe Security Council in the spring of 2009. That action \r\nset a dangerous precedent in the history of the United \r\nNations. There is therefore a need to analyse the case \r\nof UNOMIG, including its successes and shortcomings, \r\nso as to provide the United Nations community with \r\nthe appropriate lessons learned and to identify possible \r\ntools needed for the Organization to avoid similar \r\nfailures in the future. The abolition of that important \r\nUnited Nations Mission was used by a permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council as a means to achieve \r\nits expansionist geopolitical goals.\r\nDespite extensive consultations on all levels at \r\nthe United Nations and elsewhere, on 15 June 2009 \r\nthe Security Council failed to extend the mandate of \r\nUNOMIG for another term, as Russia vetoed a rollover \r\ndraft resolution aimed at providing more time for \r\nnegotiations on a new mandate. Nearly six years later, \r\nthere is no adequate replacement for that dismantled \r\ninternational presence, namely, its main pillars: \r\nUNOMIG and the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe mission in Georgia. And while \r\nthe European Union Monitoring Mission continues its \r\nduties, further efforts to provide an independent, neutral \r\nand effective international presence on the ground for \r\nthe purpose of peacekeeping has proven unsuccessful \r\nso far.\r\nUNOMIG represents a unique case in the history \r\nof the United Nations when a mission was terminated \r\npermanently, prematurely and against the will of the \r\nhost nation prior to the achievement of the main goals \r\nset out in its mandate. Nevertheless, a comprehensive \r\nanalysis of the causes and consequences of that \r\nunfortunate development has never been made in the \r\nUnited Nations. The presence of UNOMIG in Georgia \r\nwas in accordance with Chapter VI of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, and the deployment of peacekeepers \r\nfrom the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)\r\npeacekeeping force, with the Security Council’s \r\nauthorization, was conducted in accordance with \r\nChapter VIII of the Charter, as peacekeeping involving \r\nregional organizations acting in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations civilian monitors.\r\nEach time the Security Council has adopted \r\na resolution on Georgia, it has reaffirmed the \r\ncommitment of all Member States to supporting the \r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity of \r\nGeorgia within its internationally recognized borders, \r\nand reiterated the fundamental right of return for all \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons to Abkhazia, \r\nGeorgia and their individual property rights. \r\nUnfortunately, UNOMIG’s role  was limited to \r\nmonitoring the CIS forces. The latter entity, consisting \r\nexclusively of Russian military personnel, violated \r\nthe acceptable principles of peacekeeping outlined \r\nby Secretary-General’s 1994 report (S/1994/253). The \r\nreport required that the regional force, under Chapter \r\nVII of the Charter, show respect for the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of Georgia, the consent of \r\nthe parties, impartiality, an international character, \r\na clear mandate, transparency, an integral link to a \r\n15-31011 11/14\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.30\r\npolitical process for the resolution of the conflict and \r\na plan for orderly withdrawal. Nonetheless, the Russian \r\nFederation, by hijacking the peacekeeping part of the \r\nUnited Nations mandate, has been in serious material \r\nbreach of all those requirements for years. \r\nUnfortunately, Georgia’s every proposal aimed \r\nat making the CIS modus operandi multinational, \r\ntransparent, impartial and accountable — that is, \r\nin accordance with the provisions of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s 1994 report — was met with fierce objection \r\nby the Russian Federation. While the political segment \r\nof the United Nations operation in Georgia in the form \r\nof UNOMIG was highly effective and acted strictly \r\nin accordance with its mandate, as outlined in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report, the peacekeeping part of \r\nthe operation, formally the CIS peacekeeping force but \r\nin reality a Russian military force, was extensively used \r\nby the Russian Federation to serve its geopolitical ends. \r\nThe most significant demonstration of that conclusion \r\nwas the transformation of the CIS peacekeeping force \r\ninto a Russian occupation force, in itself a unique \r\nprecedent in United Nations history, and the continued \r\nillegal Russian military occupation of Georgian \r\nterritories, including the Abkhaz region.\r\nIn the light of that experience, here are some of our \r\nrecommendations. \r\nFirst, the effectiveness of monitoring of \r\npeacekeeping and other stabilizing institutions and \r\narrangements depends on the trust and confidence in \r\nwhich they are held by the parties to the conflict. No \r\nparty to the conflict, or party that is considered to be \r\nstrongly supportive of any of the sides, should assume \r\na position of command or serve as chair or arbiter or \r\nexercise any other control of an operation that depends \r\non the notions of impartiality and even-handedness in \r\norder to be effective.\r\nSecondly, particular attention has to be paid to \r\nthe ability of the international community to adjust \r\nthe relevant security arrangements to the changing \r\nenvironment, as the needs on the ground may change \r\nwith new developments. The international community \r\nmust be prepared to reassess, readjust and reinforce the \r\nstabilizing arrangements and institutions that were put \r\nin place during or immediately after the crisis situation.\r\nThirdly, special attention must be paid and support \r\nextended to the affected Member States, which, \r\nas they evolve into able and responsible players in \r\nthe international arena, should be assisted in their \r\ntransformation from mere recipients of security to \r\nproviders of security in all its dimensions, including \r\nhuman rights and development.\r\nMr. Rivas (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nof all, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for \r\norganizing today’s meeting, which enables us to \r\nexchange points of view, especially on the reports on \r\npeacekeeping operations, and to than the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his presentation this morning (see A/70/\r\nPV.29). My delegation is also grateful to the High-\r\nlevel Independent Panel on Peace Operations and \r\nthe Secretary-General for their respective reports \r\n(see A/70/95 and A/70/357). They represent a key \r\ncontribution to the intergovernmental discussions to \r\nbe held. In that connection, we believe that discussions \r\nin the relevant forums on the reviews of resolution \r\n1325 (2000), of peacekeeping operations and of the \r\npeacebuilding architecture should be carried out with \r\na holistic focus that establishes synergies among the \r\nvarious processes.\r\nUruguay, as a troop-contributing country, notes \r\nwith particular interest the processes under way. \r\nWe recently co-hosted the summit on peacekeeping \r\noperations, at which we committed to making more \r\nconcrete contributions to the system, including, to use \r\njust one example, a mechanized infantry company. We \r\nalso support the Kigali Principles on the Protection \r\nof Civilians — the outcome of the International \r\nConference on the Protection of Civilians, organized by \r\nRwanda last May — because the protection of civilians \r\nis so important today for maintaining the physical and \r\nmoral integrity of people during conflict situations, \r\nespecially the most vulnerable.\r\nOur troops have been protecting civilians in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo for a number of \r\nyears. From our experience on the ground, we know \r\nthat that is one of the activities that brings the United \r\nNations closest to local populations suffering from the \r\nimpact of violence. Uruguay is strongly committed to \r\nthe zero-tolerance policy in cases of sexual exploitation \r\nand abuse and therefore recently approved a protocol \r\nfor action in dealing with reports of sexual abuse and \r\nexploitation and paternity communicated by the United \r\nNations that was considered by a disciplinary unit \r\nas a model for other States to follow. That protocol \r\nseeks to provide guarantees, responses and support \r\nto persons who have been victims of situations of \r\nsexual exploitation and abuse because of the possible \r\nmisconduct of Uruguayan forces. A focal point has been \r\n12/14 15-31011\r\nA/70/PV.30 12/10/2015\r\nappointed within the Uruguayan Foreign Ministry for \r\nthe treatment and handling of possible cases of sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse, and we have also appointed a \r\nfocal point on the ground for any such cases that could \r\noccur.\r\nGiven our commitment to peacekeeping, we will \r\nmake the most of the opportunity and the momentum \r\nto engage in discussions in the appropriate forums \r\nwith a view to improving the efficiency to the system. \r\nUruguay will continue to bring its constructive vision \r\nto the General Assembly, and also, if the membership \r\nso decides, on 15 October, to the Security Council for \r\nthe period 2016-2017.\r\nMr. Van der Vliet (Netherlands): The Netherlands \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the observer \r\nfor the European Union and its member States earlier \r\ntoday. \r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands is grateful for \r\nthe Secetary-General’s initiative last year calling for \r\na review of the way the United Nations does business \r\nwhen it comes to its peace operations. We welcomed the \r\nsubsequent establishment of the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations under the able leadership of \r\nMr. Ramos-Horta, and we have actively supported the \r\nwork of the Panel.\r\nToday’s debate in the General Assembly on the \r\nHigh-level Panel’s report on United Nations peace \r\noperations (see A/70/95) and the Secretary-General’s \r\nimplementation report (A/70/357) is very timely. With \r\nconflicts on the rise and more refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced people than ever, we need a United Nations \r\nthat can deal with the demands of today. Successful \r\npeace operations in a broad sense are the core of what \r\nthe United Nations is expected to deliver in that regard. \r\nWe endorse the valuable and concrete recommendations \r\nin the report of the High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeace Operations, and we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, which sets firm and specific priorities \r\nfor conflict prevention, partnerships, planning and \r\nthe support of peace operations. Let me highlight four \r\naspects.\r\nThe first priority should be better protection \r\nof civilians in situations of conflict. The effective \r\nprotection of civilians is what should make the headlines. \r\nLack of protection — or worse, crimes being committed \r\nby peacekeepers — is detrimental to the reputation \r\nof the United Nations and to the people involved, not \r\nbecause it harms the Organization’s image, but because \r\nthe United Nations then fails to deliver on its core \r\nbusiness. The Security Council and the States Members \r\nof the United Nations should respond more consistently \r\nand more proactively to requests for support to protect \r\ncivilians and should engage at an earlier stage of \r\nconflict prevention. Also, a comprehensive approach \r\nand close coordination with the relevant actors, such as \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nof Human Rights, are essential. The firm and proactive \r\ncommitment of all involved to working closely with \r\nlocal communities, non-governmental organizations \r\nand especially with women is equally essential. We \r\nwitnessed that ourselves during the training at the \r\nEuropean Union Police Mission in Afghanistan.\r\nSecondly, we welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nproposals regarding the further institutionalization of \r\nand more integrated approaches by regional and global \r\npartnerships, in particular with regard to the African \r\nUnion.\r\nThirdly, it is particularly urgent for the United \r\nNations, with the support of Member States, to improve \r\nthe planning and implementation of mandates and \r\nmissions. We need a comprehensive approach, including \r\nclose consultation with troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries. The Security Council has an important \r\nresponsibility in this regard. We also need field-based, \r\nf lexible and people-centred missions, with strong \r\nleaders and well-trained troops.\r\nFourthly, numerous conferences on and reviews of \r\nthe women and peace and security agenda have taken \r\nplace. The time for the implementation of that agenda \r\nhas come. We all have a responsibility here.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations are \r\nalso responsible for international peace and security. \r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands has been and \r\nremains an active partner worldwide, helping to build \r\na safer, more peaceful and more sustainable world. \r\nSince 1947, our country has been involved in more \r\nthan 60 United Nations-mandated missions in over \r\n30 countries, deploying more than 125,000 men and \r\nwomen.\r\nIn 2013, the Netherlands returned to United \r\nNations peacekeeping with a large and innovative \r\ncontribution to the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali, focusing on \r\nhigh-value intelligence capabilities. Our contribution \r\nconsists of 450 military personnel, who are working \r\non the Mission’s intelligence capability, and civilian \r\n15-31011 13/14\r\n12/10/2015 A/70/PV.30\r\nexperts and police officers. Our experience shows that \r\nthe effective use of information and intelligence can \r\ncontribute meaningfully to achieving the mandated \r\ngoals and can save the lives of peacekeepers and \r\ncivilians.\r\nWe stand ready to help modernize United Nations \r\nmissions and make them more effective. To achieve those \r\nobjectives, the United Nations needs Member States to \r\nprovide more resources. To encourage other countries, \r\nthe Kingdom of the Netherlands hosted a European \r\nregional conference on peace operations in Amsterdam \r\nlast February. Together with Bangladesh, Ethiopia, \r\nIndonesia, Japan, Pakistan, Rwanda and Uruguay, the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands was co-host of the recent \r\nleaders’ summit on peacekeeping, organized by the \r\nUnited States and the Department of Peacekeeping \r\nOperations. The Kingdom of the Netherlands has also \r\nmade a considerable donation to the Department’s \r\nStrategic Force Generation and Capability Planning \r\nCell in order to further improve planning and outreach \r\nto Member States.\r\nAs mentioned earlier, we welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s implementation report as a follow-up to the \r\nreport of the High-level Independent Panel on Peace \r\nOperations. We call on all States Members of the United \r\nNations to collectively support its swift implementation.\r\nWith the report on the peacebuilding architecture \r\n(see A/69/968), the global study on the implementation \r\nof Security Council resolution 1325 (2000), and the \r\nreports on peace operations, we have an important and \r\nnot-to-be-missed opportunity to strengthen and improve \r\nthe United Nations peace and security architecture in \r\nan integrated and comprehensive way. In that context, \r\nlet me quote from the statement of the observer for the \r\nEuropean Union this morning: \r\n“No one reform should be undertaken in isolation \r\nfrom the others. The search for coherence, synergies \r\nand complementarities among these reviews should \r\nguide our work ahead.” (A/70/PV.29, p. 6)\r\nLet me assure you, Mr. President, that the Kingdom \r\nof the Netherlands will continue to be a constructive \r\npartner in the process ahead of us.\r\nMr. Coloma Grimberg (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMr. President, I thank you for giving me the \r\nopportunity to address such an important issue as the \r\nreview of peacekeeping operations. This review comes \r\nat a time when peacekeeping operations have tripled \r\nsince the year 2000. In other words, it is obvious that \r\nwe are going through complex times in international \r\nrelations. We therefore welcome the report of the High-\r\nlevel Independent Panel on Peace Operations (see \r\nA/70/95), headed by former President Ramos-Horta of \r\nTimor-Leste, and the subsequent report of the Secretary \r\nGeneral (A/70/357).\r\nWe align ourselves with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Morocco on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (see A/70/PV.29). We no wish to set out a \r\nfew thoughts on behalf of Chile.\r\nThe report of the Secretary-General covers many \r\nareas in which we can improve peacekeeping operations. \r\nChile values the emphasis placed on mediation and \r\nfacilitation. We believe that they are important tools that \r\ncan prevent the outbreak of conflicts and consequently \r\nsave lives. We also deem important the focus on the \r\npolitical aspect, since initiatives in peacekeeping \r\noperations must not be centred solely on the military \r\naspect. There is a need for a comprehensive strategy \r\nthat covers social and economic aspects and full respect \r\nfor human rights — in short, a road map that will lead \r\nto lasting peace.\r\nChile also notes with much interest the aspect of \r\npreparation in improving the training of the troops \r\nof peacekeeping operations. We are prepared to \r\ncooperate in that area. Furthermore, we think that \r\nthe participation of women is indispensable, not only \r\nin terms of numbers, but also in terms of occupying \r\nhigher-ranking posts.\r\nWe were present when Mr. Jan Eliasson presented \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General a few weeks ago. \r\nIn so doing, he constantly refered to the need for the \r\ninternational community to have the will to make \r\nsuccessful the review process that we are now initiating. \r\nWe believe that the success of that process will depend \r\nto a great extent on its being discussed in an open and \r\ntransparent fashion; in other words, all States Members \r\nof the United Nations must be able to participate. Only \r\nin that way will we get a solid and legitimate mandate \r\nthat will enable us to operate more easily in the new \r\ncontext of peacekeeping operations.\r\nMr. Isnomo (Indonesia): My delegation extends its \r\nappreciation to you, Sir, to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe initiative and presentation of his report (A/70 357), \r\nand to the Chair of the High-level Independent Panel \r\non Peace Operations. Indonesia extends its appreciation \r\nto President Ramos-Horta and his outstanding team for \r\ntheir exemplary work.\r\n14/14 15-31011\r\nA/70/PV.30 12/10/2015\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered this morning by the representative of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement (see A/70/PV.29).\r\nDuring the high-level week, Indonesia took \r\npart in the leaders’ summit on peace operations that \r\nwas chaired by President Barack Obama. During the \r\nsummit, Indonesia pledged to deploy by 2016 a military \r\ncomposite battalion and a formed police unit that \r\nincludes 100 individual police officers, including 40 \r\nfemale police officers. That pledge was made when \r\nwe co-hosted the Asia-Pacific regional meeting on \r\npeacekeeping operations held in Jakarta this year. In \r\nthat regard, Indonesia remains steadfastly committed \r\nto realizing our vision of 4,000 peacekeeping troops by \r\nthe year 2019.\r\nWe concur with the view that the report of the \r\nHigh-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations \r\n(see A/70/95) and the Secretary-General’s report must \r\nbe addressed because of the ever-increasing demand, \r\nchange and developments in peacekeeping operations. \r\nMy delegation believes that both reports should be \r\nimplemented by all Member States with a view to \r\nstrengthening ownership by all Member States in a \r\ntransparent manner. We therefore support further \r\nintergovernmental deliberations in the areas of concepts, \r\npolicies and strategies within the framework of the \r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations, which \r\nis mandated to formulate policymaking in peacekeeping. \r\nRecommendations related to peacekeeping should be \r\naddressed at the Special Committee.\r\nWith regard to the recommendations related to \r\nspecial political missions, we consider it appropriate \r\nthat they be addressed in the Fourth Committee, while \r\nissues pertaining to financial implications should \r\nremain within the purview of the Fifth Committee.\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nfoundation of the United Nations, we are cognizant \r\nthat fulfilling its mandate remains a challenge. Each \r\ncountry may contribute differently to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping. Even the smallest contributions matter, as \r\nthey can make a difference in maintaining international \r\npeace and security. First and foremost, deploying a \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping mission is a reflection of \r\ninternational commitment in the face of current threats \r\nto international security. We must work hard to enhance \r\ninternational cooperation and mutual trust between \r\ncountries. Indonesia continues to be committed to \r\npeacekeeping operations in all their aspects, and stands \r\nready to take that process forward within the United \r\nNations, through an intergovernmental process.\r\nThe President: We have now heard the last speaker \r\nin the debate on agenda item 122. I thank all of you \r\nfor your contributions, and for the candid and positive \r\nspirit in which you have engaged in that debate. Many \r\nwelcomed the work of the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations and the subsequent report \r\nof the Secretary-General as useful contributions to our \r\ndiscussions on how best to ensure that United Nations \r\npeace operations are as effective as possible.\r\nIn the light of today’s debate, I intend to explore \r\nwith Member States the notion of advancing a \r\nprocedural resolution that should recall in particular \r\nthat relevant bodies will assess the recommendations in \r\naccordance with established procedures. I look forward \r\nto the General Assembly’s further active consideration \r\nof those proposals.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.25 p.m.\r\n"
