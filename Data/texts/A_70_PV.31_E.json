It \r\nis with great pleasure that I wish him a successful term \r\nof duty. I am also happy to be able to have an active part \r\nin furthering the theme of his presidency “The United \r\nNations at 70: a new commitment to action”.\r\nAs the United Nations celebrates its seventieth \r\nanniversary and as the ICTR passes the torch to \r\nthe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals, we, as representatives of the ad hoc tribunals, \r\ncan once again reaffirm our commitment to action, to \r\nthe prevention of atrocities such as those that took place \r\nin Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia and continue to \r\nreinforce our message to the international community \r\nthat no longer will such crimes go unpunished.\r\nIt remains an immense honour for me to address the \r\nmembers of the Assembly and to present the twentieth \r\nand final annual report of the ICTR (see A/70/218). \r\nThe report details the progress made in the past year \r\ntowards the completion of the Tribunal’s mandate and \r\nthe transition to the Mechanism. \r\nI will now begin by providing a brief overview of the \r\nwork undertaken throughout the reporting period, from \r\n1 July 2014 to 30 June 2015, during which the Tribunal, \r\ndespite a very high workload, has made significant \r\nprogress towards the goals of the completion strategy, \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.31\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n31st plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 13 October 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nkeeping us on track for completion of the remaining \r\njudicial work by the end of 2015.\r\nOne of the most important accomplishments of the \r\nICTR in completing its mandate is that the Appeals \r\nChamber has now completed its work in all but one \r\ncase. The sole remaining judgement on appeal in the \r\nNyiramasuhuko et al. (Butare) case is expected to be \r\ndelivered in December. The date of formal closure of \r\nthe Tribunal is planned for 31 December, shortly after \r\nthe return of the final appeal judgement. Thereafter, \r\nthe Tribunal will be comprised of only a small team to \r\ncomplete the required liquidation activities, which are \r\nprojected to be completed in the first half of 2016.\r\nAs we begin to prepare for life after the ICTR, I \r\nwant to thank the Tribunal’s Division of Administrative \r\nSupport Services, which, among others, continues \r\nto play an important role in the significant progress \r\nthat the Tribunal has made in the ongoing transfer \r\nof responsibilities to the Mechanism, while at the \r\nsame time ensuring the efficient management of the \r\nTribunal’s downsizing process and providing assistance \r\nto departing staff members.\r\nAs the Assembly is aware, the Tribunal has \r\ncompleted its work at the trial level with respect to all \r\nof the 93 accused, and since January 2013 its remaining \r\njudicial work has been in the Appeals Chamber. During \r\nthe reporting period, the Tribunal issued three appeal \r\njudgements concerning four persons in the Karemera \r\nand Ngirumpatse, Nizeyimana and Nzabonimana cases, \r\nbringing the total number of persons whose judgements \r\nhave been completed at the appellate level to 55. \r\nLitigation in connection with the Butare case, the \r\nTribunal’s final appeal, generated an unexpectedly high \r\nvolume of motions before the Appeals Chamber during \r\nthe reporting period. The motions in the Butare case, \r\ncomprised of six defence appeals and one prosecution \r\nappeal, were disposed of prior to the oral hearings, \r\nwhich were held from 14 to 22 April in Arusha. Since \r\nApril the Appeals Chamber has been engaged in \r\nintensive deliberations and judgement drafting, the \r\nresult of which is a plan for delivery of the judgement \r\nbefore 31 December.\r\nTurning to the cases transferred from the ICTR \r\nto national jurisdictions, I wish to inform members \r\nthat there are now four cases pending in national \r\njurisdictions — two in Rwanda and two in France. The \r\nfunction of monitoring the referred cases now rests \r\nwith the Mechanism. During the reporting period, \r\nhowever, the Tribunal provided staff to assist the \r\nMechanism with monitoring these four cases. Staff \r\nfrom the Tribunal based in Arusha acted as interim \r\nmonitors of the proceedings in Rwanda during part of \r\nthe reporting period, and an Appeals Chamber staff \r\nmember in The Hague acted as interim monitor for the \r\ncases transferred to France throughout the reporting \r\nperiod. Both have submitted regular reports to the \r\nMechanism, and the ICTR has followed the progress \r\nclosely and will continue to provide support as required \r\nuntil its closure.\r\nI should like to express my deep gratitude to \r\nthe staff members from both the Tribunal and the \r\nMechanism who agreed to take on these important roles \r\nin addition to their core duties, and to commend them \r\nfor performing their service as monitors while ensuring \r\nthat this function did not cause any detriment to their \r\nregular workload.\r\nConsidering the work completed by the Tribunal \r\nduring the reporting period, I feel that it is incumbent \r\nupon me to take this opportunity to commend the \r\nmembers of the Appeals Chamber, together with the \r\nentirety of the staff of the ICTR, for their continued \r\nhard work. I should like once more to emphasize that \r\nthe significant progress made towards the completion \r\nof our mandate and the transition to the Mechanism \r\nwould not have been possible without their persevering \r\nefforts.\r\nAs we near the end of our mandate and continue to \r\nwork to complete the final appeal without delay, the staff \r\nwho remain at the ICTR are among the most dedicated \r\nand professional individuals in the organization. This \r\nis evidenced by the fact that many have sacrificed \r\nopportunities for more secure and lucrative employment \r\nprospects in order to see their work through until the \r\nend. I sincerely hope that Member States will continue \r\nto encourage the Secretariat and other United Nations \r\nentities to give favourable consideration to applications \r\nfrom qualified ICTR staff members, especially those \r\nwho remain with the Tribunal until the completion of \r\ntheir contracts.\r\nDespite persistent staffing challenges, the ICTR \r\nhas made substantial progress in the preparation and \r\ntransfer of the paper, electronic, and audio-visual \r\nrecords for preservation and management by the \r\nMechanism. This work was done in collaboration with \r\nthe Mechanism in order to ensure that the records \r\nwill be easily manageable after their transfer and also \r\naccessible to posterity. As of 1 October, the Mechanism \r\n15-30992 3/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nhas received approximately 78 per cent of the physical \r\nICTR records, which will be housed in the Mechanism’s \r\narchives, and the remaining records will be handed \r\nover to the Mechanism prior to the completion of the \r\nTribunal’s liquidation activities in 2016.\r\nIn addition to the inventory and appraisal of \r\nthe ICTR records, the Tribunal also worked on the \r\nredaction of audio-visual records of trial proceedings. \r\nThese records, which are vital to the ICTR’s goal of \r\nensuring that the events in Rwanda will never be \r\nforgotten, may also serve as road maps for the creation \r\nof future international tribunals and, possibly almost \r\nas important, can be used to further empower domestic \r\ncourts and educate the world on the importance of \r\nchallenging impunity.\r\nWhile the ICTR may shortly close, the records \r\ngenerated over the past two decades not only provide \r\nan account of the genocide, but also tell the story of the \r\nTribunal and the countless staff members and people \r\nfrom every corner of the world who, along with those \r\ninvolved with the trials themselves, have affected and \r\nbeen affected by the work of the ICTR. As the process of \r\ntransferring these records moves forward, I especially \r\nthank all the staff working on these important projects \r\nand commend them on the work they have completed \r\nwith distinction.\r\nDiscussing the transfer from the ICTR to the \r\nMechanism presents an opportune time for me to say a \r\nfew words about my dear friend and colleague, President \r\nMeron. Over the course of the years that we have worked \r\ntogether, I have been impressed by President Meron’s \r\nenergy, perseverance and dedication, especially when \r\none considers that he is balancing the responsibilities \r\nof President of the Mechanism and of the International \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY). Together, \r\nPresident Meron and I have been able to foster an \r\nenvironment whereby our two offices work in close \r\ncollaboration and he has been instrumental in the \r\nTribunal’s ability to complete its mandate and transfer \r\nits remaining residual functions to the Mechanism.\r\nAs I reflect upon our friendship and professional \r\nrelationship, I note with sadness that this will be the last \r\ntime that the two of us stand here together and provide \r\nour respective briefings to the Assembly. I further note \r\nthat this will also mark the final briefing by President \r\nMeron as President of the ICTY as his second term of \r\noffice will shortly expire. I wish to thank him on behalf \r\nof the entire Tribunal for his service as President of \r\nthe ICTY, which has included serving as the Presiding \r\nJudge of the ICTR and the ICTY Appeals Chamber, \r\nworking hard to retain the judicial integrity and highest \r\nprocedural safeguards, which are paramount to the \r\nlegitimacy and moral force of the Tribunals.\r\nI will now provide an update on the work of the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor. During the reporting period the \r\nOffice focused on the remaining appeals and providing \r\nassistance with other ongoing litigation, supporting the \r\ncore work undertaken by the Office of the Prosecutor of \r\nthe Mechanism and compiling various lessons-learned \r\nand best practices manuals. As part of its principal \r\nlitigation function, the Office of the Prosecutor \r\ncontinued to assist the Office of the Prosecutor of \r\nthe Mechanism with its judicial assignments and was \r\nfurther involved in the reviewing and updating of its \r\ndisclosure obligations in all the completed cases.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Office of the \r\nProsecutor also handed over the responsibility for \r\nthe tracking of the three remaining fugitives to the \r\nMechanism Office of the Prosecutor and continued to \r\ntransfer functions and responsibility for the management \r\nand preservation of its official records and archives to \r\nits Mechanism Office.\r\nThe Office of the Prosecutor has also been \r\nexemplary in its work on a number of projects related \r\nto the preservation of lessons learned and best practices \r\nthat will be pivotal in shaping the legacy of the ICTR. \r\nFor example, by creating a best practices manual for the \r\nprosecution of sexual and gender-based violence and by \r\nproviding a manual that identifies the lessons learned \r\nfrom the ICTR Prosecutor’s referral of international \r\ncriminal cases to national jurisdictions, the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor has strengthened and will continue to \r\nstrengthen the capacity of national criminal justice \r\nsystems to effectively prosecute international crimes. \r\nUpon closure, the Office of the Prosecutor will submit a \r\nformal closing report to the Security Council, detailing \r\nmany of the key challenges and accomplishments it has \r\nfaced over the past 21 years of operation.\r\nI now return to an important concern that the \r\nICTR has raised in both the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council for years, that of relocating \r\nacquitted persons and those released after serving their \r\nsentences. Since 2011, the Security Council has called \r\nupon Member States to assist the Tribunal with the \r\nrelocation of acquitted and released persons who are \r\ncurrently residing in Arusha. However, apart from the \r\nagreement of Belgium to accept one of the Tribunal’s \r\nacquitted persons and reunite him with his family in \r\n4/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nSeptember 2014, there have been few developments in \r\nthis area despite tremendous efforts by the Registrar \r\nand myself, who worked tirelessly until the end of 2014 \r\nto find solutions to this very troubling problem.\r\nWhile the Mechanism took over the formal \r\nresponsibility for relocation as of 1 January, the ICTR \r\nremains committed to assisting the Mechanism in its \r\nrelocation efforts until its closure. I once again reiterate \r\nthat the assistance of all Member States is essential \r\nto the Mechanism’s ability to relocate these acquitted \r\nand released persons, some of whom have remained in \r\nArusha for more than a decade.\r\nMore than twenty years ago, in November 1994, \r\nthe Security Council conferred on the ICTR the task \r\nof helping to bring peace and reconciliation to the \r\nGreat Lakes region through the prosecution of those \r\nresponsible for the atrocities in Rwanda in 1994. As I \r\nstand here today, two decades later and on the threshold \r\nof closure, I firmly believe that the Tribunal, along with \r\nmany others, assisted in rebuilding the trust between \r\nthe Rwandan people and the United Nations, and \r\nthat Rwanda, thanks to justice, along with numerous \r\noutreach and capacity building programmes, was able \r\nto put itself back together.\r\nAs we reflect on the work that the Tribunal has \r\naccomplished, I recall that November 2014 marked the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of the creation of the ICTR by the \r\nSecurity Council. To commemorate that occasion, the \r\nTribunal organized events to pay tribute to the victims \r\nand survivors of the genocide and to recognize those \r\nbrave souls who walked into a courtroom, most for the \r\nfirst time, and recalled events that, as former ICTR \r\nPresident Judge Navi Pillay so rightly put, “shocked the \r\ncollective conscience of mankind”.\r\nThe events held by the Tribunal included a \r\nsymposium on the legacy of the ICTR and the Seventh \r\nColloquium of International Prosecutors, and brought \r\ntogether hundreds of scholars and legal practitioners as \r\nwell as politicians, government officials, international \r\nand national prosecutors and judges, and media \r\nrepresentatives from across the globe. The Tribunal \r\nalso held satellite events in December 2014 in The \r\nHague, where its Appeals Chamber is seated, and here \r\nin New York, the place of its establishment by the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nTo ensure that the work that the ICTR has done in \r\nthe wake of the genocide is not forgotten and to ensure \r\nthat its continued battle against impunity lives on long \r\nafter its closure, the ICTR launched a new short film \r\non the occasion of its twentieth anniversary, which is \r\navailable on the Tribunal’s home page. The video has \r\nattracted more than 125,000 viewers, renewing public \r\ninterest in the events that took place in Rwanda in 1994 \r\nand reinforcing the message that the Tribunal has given \r\nby bringing those accused of the most heinous crimes \r\nto justice and, as stated in the film, coming even closer \r\nto a time when international law offers justice to all \r\npeople, everywhere.\r\nIt has been said, and I must echo this, that prosecution \r\nand judicial decisions alone cannot maintain peace or \r\nachieve reconciliation in a region devastated by such \r\nviolence. In order to ensure that affected communities \r\nunderstand not only the work of the Tribunal, but also \r\nthe ramifications of the genocide and the lessons learned \r\nin the fight against impunity, the ICTR continues to \r\nimplement outreach and capacity-building programmes \r\nand will do so until its closure.\r\nOne of the most important initiatives was the \r\ncreation of the Umusanzu Information Centre in Kigali \r\nand the ten additional provincial information centres \r\nlocated across Rwanda. These information centres, \r\nwhich provided library services, legal reference \r\nmaterials, trainings and notifications about ICTR-\r\nrelated activities, played a key role in information \r\ndissemination and improved communication and \r\naccess to the jurisprudence of the ICTR and other \r\nlegal materials. I am happy to announce that these \r\ninformation centres along with the materials contained \r\nwithin them have been handed over to the Rwandan \r\nGovernment, which has promised to continue to make \r\nthem available to the Rwandan people.\r\nThe ICTR has also engaged in various awareness-\r\nraising campaigns and conducted numerous trainings \r\nof legal professionals both in Rwanda and throughout \r\nAfrica. The sharing of developed practices and \r\nlessons learned remains a priority for the ICTR. In \r\naddition to the best practices and lessons-learned \r\nmanuals previously referenced, I want to note that the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor has also published a lessons-\r\nlearned manual for the tracking and arrest of fugitives \r\nfrom international justice and, in collaboration with \r\nother prosecution offices, created a guide entitled \r\n“Prosecuting Mass Atrocities: A Compendium of \r\nLessons Learned and Suggested Practices from the \r\nOffices of the Prosecutors”.\r\nThe sharing of developed practices between the \r\ninternational criminal tribunals and the International \r\n15-30992 5/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nCriminal Court has also been an important initiative \r\nlaunched by the Tribunal in 2013, and it saw significant \r\nprogress this past year. The goal of these developed \r\npractices workshops, two of which were held in The \r\nHague during the reporting period, is to bring together \r\nlegal officers from the international and hybrid criminal \r\ntribunals to discuss and share developed practices and \r\nlessons learned. By conducting these workshops and by \r\nproviding best-practices and lessons-learned manuals, \r\nthe Tribunal has provided tools for the continued \r\ndevelopment of international law as well as tools that \r\ncan be used by national jurisdictions to guide and \r\nstrengthen their existing judicial systems.\r\nBefore I conclude, I should like to mention that \r\nan event marking the Tribunal’s closure is planned \r\nfor 1 December, and it is my hope that many of the \r\nrepresentatives of United Nations Member States will \r\njoin us in Arusha as we make ready to pass the torch to \r\nthe Mechanism while recognizing the Tribunal’s two-\r\ndecade-long pursuit of international criminal justice. In \r\nthese final months, the focus remains on completing \r\nthe transition of functions to the Mechanism and on \r\nthe completion of the sole remaining appeal in an \r\nefficient and timely manner without compromising \r\nfair trial rights. By January 2016 the Tribunal will be \r\nin its liquidation phase and the Mechanism will have \r\nfully assumed jurisdiction and responsibility for all \r\nresidual functions and the archives of the ICTR. As \r\nthe end approaches, the Tribunal again calls upon \r\nthe international community to provide it with the \r\nnecessary support to allow the ICTR to close its doors \r\nwith a completed mandate.\r\nIt remains my honour to address this Assembly one \r\nlast time. With our mandate nearly complete, I wish, on \r\nbehalf of the entire Tribunal, to express our gratitude \r\nto the Governments of Member States for supporting \r\nthe work of the ICTR and helping in our collective \r\nfight to challenge impunity. However, there is still \r\nwork to be done. Embracing Mr. Lykketoft’s theme of \r\na new commitment to action, and with the support of \r\nMember States, I believe that the ICTR’s commitment \r\nto the development of international law and justice will \r\ncontinue to evolve in a meaningful way and lead to the \r\neventual realization of our goal to end impunity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I \r\nnow call on Judge Theodor Meron, President of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and \r\nof the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals.\r\nJudge Meron (International Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia and International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals): It is my privilege to appear before \r\nthe General Assembly, and to do so under the presidency \r\nof Denmark, in my dual capacity as President of the \r\nInternational Residual Mechanism for International \r\nCriminal Tribunals and of the International Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY).\r\nBefore I turn to specifics about the Mechanism and \r\nthe Tribunal, I take great pleasure in congratulating \r\nDenmark on its assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and I wish it every success during \r\nits term of office. I am also extremely grateful for \r\nthe efforts of the Security Council Informal Working \r\nGroup on International Tribunals throughout this past \r\nyear.\r\nAdditionally, it is an honour to acknowledge the \r\nenormous assistance that both the institutions I lead \r\nreceive from the Office of Legal Affairs and the Legal \r\nCounsel, Mr. Miguel de Serpa Soares, as well as from \r\nthe Assistant Secretary-General for Legal Affairs, \r\nMr. Stephen Mathias. Their steadfast support for \r\ninternational justice efforts and institutions are crucial \r\nto the success of our work. \r\nLast, but certainly not least, I would like to \r\nacknowledge that today marks the final annual report \r\nby the President of the Rwanda Tribunal. President \r\nJoensen has led that institution over all these years with \r\ngreat competence and integrity. It has been an honour \r\nand a privilege for me to serve along with him. I am \r\nalso very grateful to him for his extremely kind remarks \r\ntoday. I also salute all past and present principals, \r\njudges, staff members, and other stakeholders of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) \r\nfor their remarkable achievements. It is an honour to \r\ncontinue their work through the Mechanism.\r\nIn my remarks today I will focus on the highlights \r\nof the past year at the Mechanism and the ICTY, \r\nidentifying both successes and continuing challenges. \r\nA more detailed review of these matters is provided in \r\nthe written reports submitted on behalf of each of the \r\ntwo institutions I represent. I will first turn to the work \r\nof the Mechanism.\r\nThe past year has underscored once again that \r\nthe Mechanism stands at the forefront of international \r\njustice, demonstrating day in and day out that it is \r\npossible, with appropriate organization, infrastructure \r\nand leadership, to build on the lessons of the first \r\n6/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nmodern international courts and to operate efficiently \r\nand cost-effectively.\r\nFor example, in December last year I presided \r\nover the first appeal judgement of the Mechanism, in \r\nthe case of Augustin Ngirabatware v. the Prosecutor. \r\nThe judgement was delivered without any delays, \r\ndespite the complex nature of the case, an ambitious \r\nschedule, and the fact that all the judges were working \r\non it for no additional remuneration while carrying \r\nout their judicial responsibilities at the ICTR and the \r\nICTY. Based on our experience with this case, together \r\nwith the other complex judicial work the Mechanism is \r\nalready handling, I am confident that we can replicate \r\nthis success in future trials and appeals, significantly \r\nreducing costs by paying judges only for the time they \r\nspend on a case and reducing the time trials and appeals \r\ntake by increasing the efficiency of judicial processes.\r\nI am also pleased to report that the Mechanism will, \r\nby the end of the year, have assumed responsibility for \r\nall continuing ICTR functions. Over the next months, \r\nfinal administrative responsibilities, including security \r\nand building management, will be turned over on \r\nschedule to Mechanism control. We also continue to \r\nmake great progress in transferring, and preparing \r\nfor the transfer of, relevant ICTY functions, a process \r\nthat will be completed with that Tribunal’s closure in \r\n2017. This transfer of responsibilities is a tremendously \r\ncomplex process, and one we could not have achieved \r\nwithout the close cooperation of Judge Vagn Joensen, \r\nPresident of the ICTR, as well as the prosecutors, \r\nregistrars, judges and staff of the ICTR and ICTY. The \r\nMechanism is grateful for their crucial assistance and \r\ncooperation.\r\nWe are also grateful to States that have concluded or \r\nare considering entering into enforcement-of-sentence \r\nagreements with the Mechanism. The Mechanism relies \r\non the support of individual Member States to ensure \r\nthat sentences passed down by the ICTR, the ICTY and \r\nthe Mechanism itself are carried out, and the assistance \r\nof Member States in this regard is invaluable. \r\nAs the transfer of the remaining functions \r\ncontinues seamlessly and on schedule, the Mechanism \r\nis also focused on three additional challenges over the \r\nnext year.\r\nThe first of these challenges involves the \r\nconstruction of a new home for the Mechanism in \r\nArusha. Progress continues to be made in constructing \r\nthe premises, and this new facility will ensure that the \r\nMechanism can operate in Arusha with the necessary \r\nsecurity protection, a functioning courtroom, and \r\nappropriate areas for archive preservation. In July \r\nof this year we held a modest ceremony to unveil the \r\ncornerstone for the new building and were honoured \r\nby the attendance of the President of Tanzania, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete. President \r\nKikwete’s presence underscored the large-scale \r\nsupport that Tanzania has generously provided to the \r\nMechanism over the years.\r\nThe second major challenge we face is the \r\napprehension of the last remaining individuals indicted \r\nby the ICTR who are currently fugitives from justice. \r\nThe ICTY set an important precedent by accounting \r\nfor all of the individuals it indicted, a remarkable \r\nachievement. It is crucial that we ensure that the same \r\nholds true when it comes to ICTR-indicted individuals \r\nas well. I have full trust in the considerable work that \r\nthe Prosecutor of the Mechanism is undertaking to \r\napprehend these last fugitives from justice, and I call \r\nupon all Member States to cooperate in every way they \r\ncan with the Prosecutor’s Office.\r\nThe third challenge facing the Mechanism involves \r\nthe relocation of certain individuals who were indicted \r\nby the ICTR and then subsequently acquitted or released \r\nbut who are unable to return, or are afraid of returning, \r\nto their country of citizenship. The Mechanism \r\nassumed the responsibility for the relocation of these \r\nindividuals at the beginning of this year, and it has \r\nadopted a strategic plan to both guide efforts to relocate \r\nthem and reduce associated costs. The resettlement of \r\nthese individuals is a crucial challenge for international \r\njustice, and I would urge all representatives here today \r\nto liaise with the Mechanism on potential relocation \r\nopportunities.\r\nNaturally, even while addressing the specific \r\nchallenges I have outlined, and doing so in the most \r\nefficient and cost-effective manner, the Mechanism \r\ncontinues to focus on adopting best practices across a \r\nrange of areas. To that end, judges of the Mechanism \r\nrecently adopted a judicial code spelling out the ethical \r\nresponsibilities of judges and the high standards to \r\nwhich we hold ourselves. We are also engaging with our \r\nlocal, regional and national communities. For example, \r\nI recently secured outside funding to allow us to \r\nprovide training and support to Tanzanian law students \r\nand judges, thereby helping to share the Mechanism’s \r\nresources and expertise with our host State’s legal \r\ncommunity.\r\n15-30992 7/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nI will end my remarks on the specific activities \r\nof the Mechanism by reiterating how grateful the \r\njudges, my fellow principals, the staff and I are for the \r\nsupport of the international community, especially our \r\nhost States, the United Republic of Tanzania and the \r\nNetherlands. As we attempt to fulfil our mandate in the \r\nbest way possible, the support of the United Nations \r\nand its Members forms the essential foundation for all \r\nour efforts.\r\nI will now turn to the ICTY. I can report that the \r\nTribunal continues to make significant progress in \r\ncompleting the last of its trials and appeals. This year \r\nwe have already delivered two major judgements: in \r\nthe very large Prosecutor v. Vujadin Popović et al. case \r\ninvolving six appellants, and in the complex Tolimir \r\nappeal. One more appeal judgement in the Stanišić and \r\nSimatović case is expected by the end of this year. Only \r\nfour trials and two appeals will be ongoing as of the \r\nbeginning of 2016, with two trials completed by the \r\nfirst quarter of the new year, one additional trial and \r\none appeal completed during the remainder of 2016, \r\nand the two last cases completed before the end of \r\n2017. Accordingly, the ICTY is expected to complete \r\nits operations in about two years.\r\nAs the Tribunal completes its remaining judicial \r\nwork, it is rapidly downsizing and certain essential \r\nfunctions are being transferred to the Mechanism in \r\naccordance with the mandate of the Security Council. \r\nThe Tribunal is committed to completing its work as \r\nquickly and efficiently as possible. \r\nOf course, this continued downsizing, as I have \r\npreviously noted, inevitably has a negative effect on \r\nstaff morale, as employees of the Tribunal understand \r\nthat their jobs may soon cease to exist and seek other \r\nprofessional opportunities. In circumstances like these, \r\nindividuals’ understandable search for security can \r\nlead — and indeed has already led — to the departure \r\nof key drafting team members. Such attrition has \r\nalready caused delays to case completion. It has been a \r\ntop priority for me as President to take every possible \r\nstep to address this risk.\r\nI have been active in liaising with the Registrar \r\nand with the Office of Human Resources Management \r\nto obtain waivers to regulations that may constrain \r\noptimum recruitment and retention. In addition, I am in \r\nclose contact with the presiding judges of all trials and \r\nappeals and have instructed the Registrar to supply all \r\nthe resources they require in order to fully staff their \r\ncases and also to provide for promotion opportunities \r\nthat may prevent staff attrition. The Registrar has \r\nagreed to meet any request for resources from presiding \r\njudges. Adopting that approach will significantly reduce \r\nthe risk of delays to projected judgement delivery dates.\r\nMy remarks today mark the last time I will appear \r\nbefore the Assembly as President of the ICTY. I have \r\nbeen deeply honoured to serve in this position between \r\n2003 and 2005 and again between 2011 and November \r\nof this year, having been elected and re-elected by my \r\nfellow judges. On a more personal level, I wish to say \r\nthat, having lived through the Second World War and \r\nwitnessed some of its horrors as a child, it has been a \r\nparticular privilege for me to help guide the first of the \r\nmodern era’s international criminal tribunals.\r\nI am well aware that in recent times international \r\ncourts, including the ICTY, the ICTR and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, have been the subject \r\nof significant criticism. Some of these reproaches \r\ncan be explained as an inevitable by-product of the \r\ntribunals’ mandates to try cases of extraordinary \r\ndimensions, assessing the evidence before them and \r\nindividual criminal responsibility without regard \r\nto how these verdicts impact on particular political \r\nagendas or align with popular sentiment. However, \r\nother criticisms, about matters such as the slowness of \r\njudicial proceedings and the significant costs of trials \r\nconducted at the international level, can often be quite \r\nfair.\r\nIt is partly because of these latter critiques and the \r\nneed to address them in a substantive way that I am \r\nso delighted and honoured to still serve as President \r\nof the Mechanism. As I noted earlier, I believe that \r\nthis institution is already setting an influential and \r\nimportant example of best practices by preserving and \r\ncarrying forward the manifest strengths of the existing \r\ninternational criminal tribunals while reducing costs \r\nand increasing efficiency.\r\nBut even as we dedicate our efforts at the Mechanism \r\nto finding new ways to improve our work and our \r\nproductivity, and to serving as a new and vital model \r\nfor international justice, we must not let such efforts \r\nlead us to forget the ways in which the pioneers of this \r\nnew age of modern international criminal tribunals, \r\nwith all of their admitted f laws, have transformed \r\nour understanding of, and responses to, grave crimes. \r\nAs the first of the modern generation of international \r\ncriminal tribunals, the ICTY and the ICTR stand as \r\ninspirational examples of the international community’s \r\ncommitment to ending impunity and promoting the rule \r\n8/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nof law. Through their significant corpus of substantive \r\nand procedural judgements and decisions, the Tribunals \r\nhave played a pre-eminent role in broadening knowledge \r\nof, and compliance with, customary international law, \r\nincluding, notably, with regard to prohibitions on sexual \r\nassault, protections applicable in non-international \r\narmed conflicts, and jurisprudence on genocide and \r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nIn addition, by accounting for every single \r\nindividual it indicted, the ICTY has struck a blow \r\nagainst impunity that is difficult to equal, its example \r\nserving as a stern warning to those who would hope \r\nto escape the consequences of their actions. And by \r\ngiving rise to broader justice efforts, both national and \r\ninternational, the Tribunals have forever altered the \r\nglobal community’s response to future conflicts — as \r\nwell as those present and past — and increased the \r\nprotections afforded to the most vulnerable populations \r\naffected by conflict.\r\nIn celebrating these achievements, much credit \r\nis due to the judges, the United Nations staff and the \r\nattorneys who have worked tirelessly at and with the \r\nTribunals to deliver on and indeed exceed their initial \r\npromise. But this credit is, and must be, shared with \r\nall the Members of the United Nations. The material, \r\npolitical and many other types of assistance provided \r\nby the Member States have been essential to the success \r\nof the international criminal tribunals, and they will \r\nremain crucial to the efforts to make these courts even \r\nmore impactful and efficient in years to come. I cannot \r\nunderscore enough that without the partnership of the \r\nGovernments represented in the Assembly, none of the \r\naccomplishments I have discussed today would have \r\nbeen possible.\r\nOf course, there is a long path to travel until \r\nrespect for the rule of law is universal and the concept \r\nof impunity is relegated to history. But the ICTY, the \r\nICTR and their fellow courts have ushered in a new \r\nera of international law in just the past two decades \r\nalone — a new era of accountability that would have \r\nbeen almost impossible to imagine even 30 years ago, \r\nfar less in the dark days of the Second World War. \r\nI am confident that with the Assembly’s support, \r\ninternational criminal tribunals such as the Mechanism \r\ncan build upon these achievements in the years to come, \r\nserving as harbingers of a world reflecting the highest \r\naspirations of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the observer of the European Union.\r\nMr. Marhic (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries Turkey, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; and the European Free Trade Association \r\n(EFTA) country Liechtenstein, member of the European \r\nEconomic Area, as well as Ukraine, Armenia and \r\nGeorgia, align themselves with this statement.\r\nWe reaffirm our unwavering support for the work \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR), the International Tribunal for the Former \r\nYugoslavia (ICTY) and the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals. We praise both \r\nTribunals for their achievements and invaluable \r\ncontributions to our shared goal of ending impunity for \r\nserious international crimes. We welcome the fact that \r\nthe Mechanism increasingly assumes responsibility \r\nfor all aspects of the two Tribunals’ work. We thank \r\nPresident Meron and President Joensen for their reports \r\nand commend them for their efforts in completing the \r\nwork of the Tribunals and advancing the work of the \r\nMechanism. It is important that both Tribunals and the \r\nMechanism receive the necessary support to complete \r\ntheir mandates.\r\nThe Tribunals have played a key role in \r\nstrengthening the rule of law and promoting long-term \r\nstability and reconciliation. Since their establishment, \r\nboth Tribunals have embodied the need to fight impunity \r\nand the refusal by the international community to let the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern escape justice. They were forerunners in \r\ncreating jurisprudence in their field. They paved the \r\nway for the International Criminal Court (ICC).\r\nWe welcome the fact that the ICTR remains on \r\ncourse for closure by the end of 2015, while the closure \r\nof the ICTY is foreseen at the end of 2017, and we \r\nvalue the fact that both Tribunals have been taking \r\nsteps to ensure a smooth handover of functions to \r\nthe Mechanism. Such a smooth transition process is \r\nimportant in order for both branches of the Mechanism \r\nto carry on and protect the work of the Tribunals. \r\nFinally, we note with satisfaction that both Tribunals \r\nare committed to completing their proceedings in an \r\nefficient and timely manner, without compromising \r\nfair-trial rights.\r\nWe recall that the responsibility of States to \r\ncooperate with the Tribunals and the Mechanism, in \r\n15-30992 9/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nparticular in bringing those indicted to justice, remains \r\ncrucial to the ability of the judicial institutions to \r\ncomplete their mandates. With respect to the ICTR, \r\nwe recall that, despite continuing appeals by the \r\ninternational community, nine accused individuals \r\nremain at large, including six whose cases have been \r\nreferred to Rwanda. The failure to arrest these fugitives \r\nis a matter of grave concern. \r\nWe note with appreciation the new projects initiated \r\nby the Office of the Prosecutor of the Mechanism, \r\njointly developed with the Rwandan authorities, to \r\nfacilitate the tracking and arrest of the remaining \r\nfugitives. We also note with appreciation the support \r\nreceived from INTERPOL and some Member States, \r\nincluding through the War Crimes Rewards Program \r\nof the United States. We call upon all States concerned \r\nto intensify their efforts and cooperation with the \r\nArusha branch of the Mechanism in order to secure \r\nthe arrest and surrender of all remaining fugitives. The \r\nincreased cooperation of Member States is also needed \r\nwith respect to the efforts deployed by the Mechanism \r\nto relocate acquitted persons and convicted persons \r\nreleased in the United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nWith regard to the ICTY, we note that at the closure \r\nof the reporting period, four trials and three appeals \r\nwere pending, with all 161 indicted individuals being \r\naccounted for. We welcome the fact that the organs \r\nof the Tribunal have adopted measures to maximize \r\nthe efficiency of pending judicial proceedings and to \r\nminimize delays caused by the attrition of staff, the ill \r\nhealth of accused persons and unforeseen complexities \r\nin some proceedings. We note that the Office of the \r\nProsecutor has acknowledged the assistance it has \r\nreceived from the European Union and its member \r\nStates, and we will continue to support the Office \r\nof the Prosecutor. We welcome the fact that the joint \r\nEuropean Union/ICTY Training Project for National \r\nProsecutors and Young Professionals from the former \r\nYugoslavia remains a central component of the efforts \r\nof the Office of the Prosecutor to build national capacity \r\nin the national justice sectors. \r\nWe also note that the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nremains satisfied with the level of cooperation between \r\nthe Office and the authorities in the States concerned. \r\nCompleting the process of rendering justice for \r\ncrimes committed during the conflicts in the former \r\nYugoslavia is an essential contribution to lasting peace, \r\naccountability and the rule of law. Full cooperation with \r\nthe ICTY therefore remains an essential condition of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process in the Western \r\nBalkans and is an essential condition for membership \r\nof the European Union.\r\nWe welcome the work of the Tribunals and the \r\nMechanism on strengthening the capacity of national \r\nauthorities to handle the remaining war crimes \r\ncases effectively. We fully support the training \r\nand information exchanges as well as the access to \r\npublicly available investigating material and evidence \r\nfrom the Tribunals. In the context of the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the genocide in Srebrenica, which was \r\ncommemorated in July 2015, this is important for the \r\nTribunal’s legacy and for strengthening the domestic \r\ncapacity to adjudicate war crimes. In its Stabilization \r\nand Association Process for the Western Balkans, the \r\nEU is increasingly underlining the importance of local \r\nownership for handling war crimes cases in line with the \r\nneed to fight impunity. In this regard, the EU’s direct \r\nbudgetary support to domestic war crimes prosecution, \r\nin place since 2013 in some Western Balkan countries, \r\ncomplements the efforts to increase national capacities \r\nin tackling the backlog of war crimes cases. \r\nWe note that the Office of the Prosecutor continued \r\nto promote improved regional cooperation between \r\nStates of the former Yugoslavia in judicial matters, \r\nand we welcome the fact that meaningful results were \r\nachieved in this regard, even if key challenges remain. \r\nWe call on the States of the former Yugoslavia to \r\ncontinue regional cooperation in criminal matters, in \r\naccordance with the rules and principles of international \r\nlaw, including international criminal law. We note \r\nthe serious concerns expressed by the Office of the \r\nProsecutor in the parts of the report addressing national \r\nwar crimes prosecutions, in particular in relation to the \r\nfact that national prosecution offices have not yet fully \r\nadopted and implemented strategic approaches to the \r\ninvestigation and prosecution of war crimes, including \r\nprioritization of the most complex cases.\r\nWe note that the Arusha branch of the Office of the \r\nProsecutor of the International Residual Mechanism \r\ncontinued to monitor progress in cases transferred \r\nto national jurisdictions, and that work is ongoing on \r\na number of projects, including a regional training \r\nprogramme on the investigation and prosecution of \r\nsexual and gender-based violence. We welcome the fact \r\nthat the efforts of the ICTR regarding capacity-building, \r\ntraining and education have now expanded beyond East \r\nAfrica and include the sharing of best practices and \r\n10/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nlessons learned with other international tribunals and \r\ndomestic authorities.\r\nWe will continue to support both the principle and \r\nthe system of international criminal justice, together \r\nwith its essential role in bringing about lasting peace, \r\naccountability and the rule of law, and we call on all \r\nStates to do the same. \r\nWe urge all States to cooperate with both Tribunals \r\nand branches of the Mechanism, in full compliance with \r\ntheir obligations under the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions. It is indeed important that knowledge \r\ngained and lessons learned in the fight against impunity \r\nare not forgotten.\r\nMr. Norman (Canada): I have the honour of \r\nspeaking today on behalf of New Zealand, Australia \r\nand my own country, Canada (CANZ). \r\nLet me first thank Presidents Meron and Joensen \r\nfor their reports and their diligence and hard work.\r\nCANZ wishes to take the opportunity to reaffirm \r\nits strong support for the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. During \r\nthe more than 20 years since their establishment, the \r\nTribunals have developed the practice of international \r\ncriminal law through the administration and \r\nmanagement of complex criminal proceedings. They \r\nhave added breadth and depth to international criminal \r\nlaw jurisprudence, administering justice in cases \r\ninvolving some of the most horrific crimes in recent \r\nhistory. The many achievements and the enormous \r\ncontribution of the Tribunals towards ending impunity \r\ncannot be overstated.\r\nCANZ acknowledges the efforts of the Tribunals as \r\nthey work towards their completion strategy deadlines, \r\nall the while ensuring that fundamental procedural \r\nsafeguards are met. Significantly, there are no fugitives \r\nat large from the ICTY. The Tribunal has concluded \r\nproceedings against 147 of 161 indictees. Four trials \r\ninvolving four individuals and three appeals involving \r\nten individuals continue before the ICTY. Decisions are \r\nexpected before the end of this year in two of the trials.\r\nCANZ acknowledges that staff attrition is an \r\nincreasing challenge for the ICTY and that the loss of \r\nsenior staff and their extensive case-specific knowledge \r\nhas resulted in delays. We encourage the United Nations \r\nto look at creative solutions to meet this challenge and \r\nencourage the ICTY to continue in its efforts to ensure \r\nthat its remaining judicial proceedings are advanced \r\nboth efficiently and effectively.\r\nThe ICTR has completed its work on substantive \r\ncases at the trial level for all 93 indictees, including \r\nreferring ten accused to national jurisdictions for \r\nprosecution. Nine fugitives remain at large, three \r\nof whom will be tried by the Residual Mechanism if \r\napprehended. The cooperation of States is crucial to \r\nthe arrest and surrender of these individuals. CANZ \r\nwelcomes the Tribunal’s proactive approach and its \r\ncommitment to meeting its completion targets.\r\nWithout wishing to downplay the significant efforts \r\nof the Tribunals’ judges, staff members, prosecutors, \r\nand defence counsel, CANZ notes that States, too, have \r\na central role to play as facilitators of the Tribunals’ \r\nimportant work towards ending impunity. In this \r\nregard, we acknowledge that the final apprehension \r\nof outstanding fugitives for the ICTY was due in large \r\npart to the cooperative efforts of States and the ICTY \r\nProsecutor.\r\nCANZ encourages similar cooperation, including \r\nwith the Residual Mechanism pursuant to Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2150 (2014), by all States in relation \r\nto the nine outstanding fugitives of the ICTR. We must \r\nengage in dialogue on options to address the plight of \r\nthe persons acquitted and released by the ICTR who \r\nneed to be relocated from Arusha. The Tribunals’ work \r\ndoes not end with the delivery of a final judgement. Part \r\nof their legacy lies in the ongoing welfare of victims and \r\nwitnesses, as well as accused and sentenced persons.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nCANZ wishes to reiterate its support for the \r\nDecember 2010 decision of the Security Council to \r\nestablish the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals (Security Council resolution 1966 \r\n(2010), which is integral to ensuring that the rule of \r\nlaw, the practical application of criminal justice, the \r\nprotection of witnesses and the maintenance of the \r\nTribunal archives continue beyond the completion of \r\nthe Tribunals’ respective mandates. We welcome the \r\nfact that the most recent reports of the ICTY and ICTR \r\ndemonstrate the Tribunals’ commitment to ensuring \r\nthat their remaining activities are effectively transferred \r\nto the Residual Mechanism.\r\nThe Security Council emphasized that the Residual \r\nMechanism should be a small and efficient structure. \r\nFor this goal to be realized, close cooperation and \r\n15-30992 11/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nconsultation between the Mechanism and the Tribunals \r\nis essential, as is cooperation by Member States. \r\nCANZ notes the work being undertaken to ensure a \r\nsmooth transition and to share best practices. We look \r\nforward to the results of the 2016 review of the Residual \r\nMechanism.\r\nThe successful completion of the Tribunals’ work \r\nand their ultimate legacy for international criminal \r\njustice are dependent, in large part, on the individual \r\nand collective efforts of Member States. For our part, \r\nNew Zealand, Australia and Canada will continue to \r\noffer our full cooperation and support to the Tribunals \r\nand to the Residual Mechanism to give practical effect \r\nto our steadfast commitment to international criminal \r\njustice.\r\nMs. Stener (Norway): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland, \r\nIceland, Sweden and my own country, Norway.\r\nLet me first thank Judge Meron, President of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \r\n(ICTY) and the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals, and Judge Vagn Joensen, President \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR), for the informative annual reports they \r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nWe applaud the significant achievements of \r\nboth Tribunals over the past 22 years, which have \r\nincluded important contributions to the development \r\nof international criminal law during that period. In \r\nparticular, both Tribunals deserve praise for their work \r\nin the area of addressing sexual and gender-based \r\ncrimes. The important achievements of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda should be given special \r\nmention at this juncture, as the Tribunal is in its final \r\nmonths of functioning. Closure of the Tribunal is \r\nprojected for December, and only the liquidation of the \r\nTribunal’s assets is expected to continue after 2015. The \r\nimpact of the ICTR, in both the short term and the long \r\nterm, has been profound. The same can be said of its \r\nimpact at the local level and on the international stage.\r\nWith the Akayesu judgement in 1998, the ICTR \r\nbecame the first-ever international tribunal to convict \r\na person for genocide since the adoption in 1948 of the \r\nConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the \r\nCrime of Genocide. With the Kambanda judgement, the \r\nICTR became the first tribunal to convict a former head \r\nof State for such crimes. In providing a definition of \r\nrape and in recognizing rape as an act of genocide, the \r\nICTR has also been at the forefront of the development \r\nof international criminal law. Clearly, its legacy will \r\nplay an important role in preventing similar atrocities \r\nfrom taking place in the future. We also find particular \r\nreason to highlight the legacy of the Office of the \r\nProsecutor of the ICTR, which has contributed greatly \r\nto general capacity-building and to the sharing of best \r\npractices among practitioners in the field.\r\nAt the ICTY, there are now ongoing proceedings for \r\nonly 14 accused, of which four are at the trial level and \r\nten are before the Appeals Chamber. Work to ensure \r\na continued smooth transfer of the ICTY’s functions \r\nto the Residual Mechanism for International Criminal \r\nTribunals is continuing. No fugitives are at large. As \r\nfor other international criminal tribunals and courts, \r\ncooperation with national jurisdictions is an important \r\nmatter for the ICTY. We have noted the important work \r\nof the Office of the Prosecutor on this matter, including \r\nin support of domestic war-crimes prosecutions.\r\nThe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals plays a key role in the overall United \r\nNations system in dealing with the crimes committed \r\nin the Balkans and in Rwanda, as it is tasked with \r\ncontinuing the jurisdiction, rights and obligations, and \r\nessential functions of the ICTR and the ICTY and with \r\nmaintaining the legacy of both institutions after the \r\ncompletion of their mandates. During the past year, the \r\nAppeals Chamber of the Mechanism delivered its first \r\njudgement. The Mechanism’s Registry coordinated \r\na wide range of judicial services, including the \r\nprotection of witnesses, the enforcement of sentences \r\nand collaboration with the Tribunals on the preparation \r\nof records and archives for transfer to the Mechanism.\r\nLike the ICTY and the ICTR, the Mechanism \r\ndepends on the cooperation of national Governments \r\nto arrest three of the nine fugitives still at large from \r\nthe ICTR, who are to be tried before the Mechanism. \r\nAs United Nations Member States, we are all obliged to \r\ncooperate unconditionally and to comply with requests \r\nfor assistance and orders from the Mechanism. We take \r\nthis opportunity to encourage all States to intensify \r\ntheir efforts regarding that important matter.\r\nMr. Orellana Zabalza (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \r\n(ICTY) and of the International Residual Mechanism \r\nfor Criminal Tribunals, Judge Meron, and the President \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n12/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\n(ICTR), Judge Joensen, for their excellent statements. \r\nTheir briefings, together with the annual reports of the \r\nTribunals that we have before us, reflect the tireless \r\nefforts that the Tribunals have made to successfully \r\ncomply with their mandates.\r\nWith regard to the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda, we welcome the important progress made \r\nduring the past year towards the goals of its completion \r\nstrategy, in particular with regard to appeals and the \r\ntransition to the International Residual Mechanism \r\nfor Criminal Tribunals. The imminent closure of the \r\nTribunal is reason for great satisfaction, and we pay \r\ntribute to the President for leaving us a legacy of great \r\nlegal, political, historical and international value. That \r\nrepresents a success for the Tribunals and a success \r\nfor the United Nations and the entire international \r\ncommunity.\r\nAt the same time, much remains to be done before \r\nthe Tribunal can close its doors. I am referring in \r\nparticular to the urgent situation of the acquitted or \r\nreleased persons and those who have served their \r\nsentences and are living in safe houses in Arusha. \r\nThat must be a priority, and the Security Council must \r\nresolve that issue, since it is a major humanitarian issue \r\nwith major consequences for the Council’s credibility. \r\nIt seems practical to us for that issue to be dealt with by \r\nthe Residual Mechanism, and we hope that the strategic \r\nplan for relocation, introduced in June of this year in \r\norder to find a sustainable solution to the issue, will be \r\nsuccessfully implemented. \r\nLet us recall that the cooperation of States continues \r\nto be the cornerstone of the Tribunal’s ability to conclude \r\nits mandate and of the Mechanism’s continuing to \r\ncomply with its residual functions. Although it is true \r\nthat the transfer of cases to national jurisdictions has \r\nfacilitated the conclusion of the Rwanda Tribunal, that \r\ngoal will have been truly reached when all the fugitives \r\nhave been arrested and brought to justice, either before \r\nthe Residual Mechanism or before national tribunals. \r\nWe trust that Member States will continue to be united \r\nin that common effort. \r\nWe support the holding of an event next month on \r\nthe occasion of the closure of the Tribunal. Guatemala’s \r\nfull collaboration can be relied on so that the Tribunal \r\ncan complete its mandate and that the Mechanism \r\nwill then be able to fully assume jurisdiction and \r\nresponsibility for the residual functions and archives of \r\nthe Tribunal. \r\nThe main objective of the Tribunals is to punish \r\nperpetrators and respond to the victims. In the case of \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia, \r\nwe see that 161 accused were brought to trial, 80 \r\nsentences were passed, and the cases undergoing a first \r\ntrial and the three pending appeals are well under way. \r\nWe congratulate the members of the ICTY for their \r\ndetermination to implement the completion strategy. \r\nWe especially highlight the personal efforts of the \r\nPresident of the Tribunal to prevent delays.\r\nIt is fundamental to assist the Tribunal to conclude \r\nits work on time. We listened with close attention to \r\nthe concerns expressed by the President with regard to \r\nthe Tribunal’s capacity to maintain the pace of its work \r\nwhile it meets the timeline for the completion. In recent \r\nyears we have heard how staff shortages and the loss of \r\nstaff have affected trials and appeals. We share those \r\nconcerns, and we hope that the required support will be \r\nprovided so that the Tribunal can successfully complete \r\nits mandate.\r\nWe reiterate the risks in conducting a simple cost/\r\nbenefit exercise in order to measure the degree of justice. \r\nThe fight against impunity and the determination of \r\nthe truth are values that justify themselves, especially \r\nin such serious situations as those brought before the \r\nTribunals.\r\nIn July, 20 years had passed since the Srebrenica \r\ngenocide. For Guatemala, the commemoration of \r\nSrebrenica was important for two reasons: first, for the \r\nvictims and as a reminder of the situation in which the \r\nBalkan region finds itself; and secondly, the role that \r\ninternational criminal justice played and continues to \r\nplay especially through this International Tribunal.\r\nWe are pleased at the progress made in the transition \r\nto the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals. We welcome the support of both Tribunals \r\nto ensure a gradual, effective transition to the Residual \r\nMechanism. The Mechanism has conducted its judicial \r\nand other work with remarkable speed, while at the \r\nsame time upholding the highest standards. It is a model \r\nfor institutions of international criminal justice.\r\nThe Mechanism is also essential because beyond \r\nthe judicial proceedings, there is a central aspect behind \r\nthe creation of the Tribunals that we should never lose \r\nsight of. I am referring to the promotion of peace and \r\nreconciliation. Although the Tribunals have made \r\nconsiderable contributions towards that end, there are \r\nother important elements for supporting reconciliation, \r\n15-30992 13/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nsuch as the appropriate management of archives and \r\nassistance to national jurisdictions.\r\nWe want the legacy of the Tribunals to be \r\npreserved. As the work of both Tribunals draws to its \r\nend, there is no doubt that they have established a solid \r\nbasis for international peace and justice, thanks to their \r\ndevelopment and application of international criminal \r\nlaw.\r\nLastly, I wish to avail myself of this opportunity to \r\nexpress our unconditional support for the International \r\nTribunals and the Residual Mechanism and to encourage \r\nStates to continue supporting those institutions.\r\nMs. Butts (United States of America): The United \r\nStates thanks Presidents Meron and Joensen for their \r\nreports on the work of the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia (ICTY), the International Criminal \r\nTribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) and the International \r\nResidual Mechanism for Criminal Tribunals. Without \r\nthe diligence and hard work of the Tribunals and \r\ntheir determination to bring justice to the victims of \r\nthe atrocities committed in the former Yugoslavia \r\nand Rwanda, many of those responsible for those \r\natrocities would not have been held accountable for \r\ntheir crimes. Thanks to the Tribunals, the victims of \r\nhorrific atrocities have received a meaningful measure \r\nof justice, and the international community has greatly \r\nadvanced international peace and security during the \r\npast 20 years through the justice and accountability the \r\nTribunals have provided for the atrocities committed.\r\nAs the ICTR prepares to close in the next few \r\nmonths, the United States would like to extend \r\nits deep appreciation to the Tribunal’s many staff \r\nmembers, including judges, prosecutors, support staff, \r\ninvestigators and the defence attorneys, who took care \r\nover the past decades to be compassionate with victims, \r\nuphold the principles of international law and ensure \r\nthe legacy of the Tribunal.\r\nThanks to its hard work, the ICTR concluded all \r\nof its trials in 2012 and is close to completing all of \r\nthe appeals work, with just one appeals judgement in \r\na complex, multi-defendant case to be delivered by \r\nthe end of the year. Despite difficulties in replacing \r\nexperienced staff, the Tribunal is set for a smooth \r\nand efficient transition to the Residual Mechanism, as \r\nwell as to national courts, where proceedings against \r\nthe ICTR indictees who remain at large are set to take \r\nplace.\r\nWe also commend the ICTY for a productive year. \r\nJudgements have been issued in two appeals, plus an \r\nadditional six interlocutory appeals, and progress has \r\nbeen made on the four cases remaining at the trial \r\nlevel. We welcome the efforts by the Trial Chambers to \r\nexpedite judgements in those cases and to ensure that \r\nthey are delivered on time. Our appreciation also goes \r\nto the Victim and Witness Section, which has provided \r\nservices to the 206 witnesses who have appeared before \r\nthe Tribunal and has completed its goal of conducting \r\n300 witness interviews, all the while protecting the \r\nintegrity of the process and the human dignity of the \r\nwitnesses. We also express our deep appreciation and \r\nadmiration for Judge Theodor Meron, who will shortly \r\ncomplete his term as President of the ICTY and whose \r\nwise leadership has guided the Tribunal during the last \r\nfew years.\r\nInternational criminal law is one of the greatest \r\nvehicles we have for promoting peace and justice \r\nthroughout the world. As the grim events across the \r\nworld remind us, from Syria to the Central African \r\nRepublic, South Sudan and North Korea, the challenge \r\nof ending mass atrocities is greater than ever, but \r\ninstitutions such as the ICTY and the ICTR are \r\nresponsible for providing the necessary justice that is \r\nowed to victims who have suffered the greatest harm \r\nthat can be inflicted on humanity — genocide, war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity. By building an \r\nextraordinary legal edifice of international criminal \r\naccountability, the Tribunals have helped to lay \r\nthe groundwork for future generations to prosecute \r\nviolations of international law more efficiently and \r\nwith a better understanding of the law.\r\nBy this time next year, the ICTR will have \r\nsuccessfully completed its mandate and will have \r\ntransferred its remaining workload to the Residual \r\nMechanism. That will mark the end of an era that, \r\ncombined with the work of the ICTY, has thoroughly \r\nadvanced international law, showed how international \r\nad hoc tribunals can be successful, and revealed what \r\nthe international community can do on behalf of the \r\nvictims of atrocities. And so the United States would \r\nlike to thank all of those who worked with the ICTR to \r\nmake it such a successful endeavour. \r\nMay the victims in Rwanda and the former \r\nYugoslavia never be forgotten, and may the lessons \r\nlearned from the ICTR and the ICTY always be \r\nremembered.\r\n14/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nMr. Obradović (Serbia): I am very privileged and \r\nhonoured to speak here today as the representative \r\nof the Republic of Serbia. Before I proceed, I should \r\nlike to welcome Judge Theodor Meron, President of \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \r\n(ICTY) and the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals, and Judge Vagn Joensen, President \r\nof the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR), and thank them for their annual reports.\r\nAs a European Union candidate country, Serbia \r\naligns itself with the statement made earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of the European Union. As Serbia has \r\na very high stake in the ICTY proceedings, however, I \r\nfeel duty-bound to add a few observations on Serbia’s \r\nbehalf in my capacity as its representative to this \r\nmeeting.\r\nSerbia remains firmly committed to the principles \r\nand system of international criminal justice and its \r\nessential role in fighting impunity. It has followed \r\nthe ICTY activities with great attention and interest, \r\nespecially those concerning the completion of its long-\r\nlasting trials. However, it has seen its grave concerns \r\nborne out once again by the failure to determine the \r\ndate of the rendering of the trial judgement in the Šešelj \r\ncase. \r\nThe accused, Vojislav Šešelj, is a citizen of my \r\ncountry. He is the leader of an opposition party with \r\nsignificant right-wing leanings in domestic and \r\nregional politics. Charged with serious allegations \r\nfor crimes against humanity in his alleged role in \r\nevents that took place at the beginning of the armed \r\nconflicts in the former Yugoslavia, he has still not \r\nbeen sentenced. Waiting for the completion of the first-\r\ninstance proceedings for more than 12 years, he spent \r\n11 years and 8 months in United Nations detention. \r\nEven the Trial Chamber raised concern in his case \r\nwhen it said that the “very long provisional detention ... \r\nas time went on, became more and more irreconcilable \r\nwith the presumption of innocence and the guarantees \r\nof a fair trial”. \r\nBy an order of 6 November 2014, issued on \r\nhumanitarian grounds, the accused was provisionally \r\nreleased and transferred to Serbia, where he is receiving \r\ntherapy for a life-threatening disease. His case is an \r\nexample of the failure of the international criminal \r\njudiciary to fulfil its highest purposes and ambitions.\r\nMeanwhile, Serbia continues to be firmly \r\ncommitted to cooperating with the Tribunal and has \r\ndone its best to fulfil its international obligations. The \r\nsatisfaction of the Office of the Prosecutor with the level \r\nof cooperation shown by Serbia has been expressed \r\nin the ICTY report. Serbia, for its part, continues to \r\ngive its full support to the efforts being made by the \r\nPresident, the judges, the Office of the Prosecutor and \r\nthe Registry aimed at completing the activities of the \r\nInternational Tribunal in preparation for the transition \r\nto the Residual Mechanism. We trust and believe that \r\nthe transitional process can be carried out without any \r\nnegative effect on the procedural rights, either of the \r\naccused persons or of the victims.\r\nAt the domestic level, I am glad to inform the \r\nGeneral Assembly that the Serbian judiciary continues \r\nto investigate, prosecute and try persons suspected of \r\ncommitting the worst atrocities in the 1990s. The draft \r\nnational strategy on war crimes issues will be published \r\nat the end of this year. That document will contain a \r\nroad map for the future activities and improvements \r\nneeded in that field with regard to both domestic trials \r\nand regional cooperation. The Government of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia firmly believes that the domestic \r\nprosecution of the core international crimes committed \r\nduring the armed conflicts of the 1990s is one of the \r\nmost important steps in the process of reconciliation, \r\nas well as for the development of good neighbourly \r\nrelations and lasting peace in the region of the former \r\nYugoslavia.\r\nFurthermore, the efficient prosecution of war \r\ncrimes is a precondition for the full democratization of \r\nour society through the affirmation of the rule of law \r\nand respect for the principles of humanitarian law, which \r\nare the cherished achievements of modern humankind. \r\nIt is a joint duty for all of the countries of our region \r\nto investigate and prosecute persons responsible for \r\nthe most serious crimes, including those committed \r\nin Srebrenica, Sarajevo, Vukovar, Knin, Kosovo and \r\nMetohija or anywhere else in the former Yugoslavia. \r\nThose proceedings must be conducted without any \r\ndiscrimination on the basis of the national, ethnic or \r\nreligious origin of either the perpetrator or the victim.\r\nHowever, Serbia cannot be satisfied with the \r\nmanner in which that goal is being achieved. On the \r\ninternational level, we have noted that in almost all \r\nmajor ICTY cases in which the victims were groups \r\nor individuals of Serb ethnicity, the accused were \r\nacquitted. We were led to believe that remedies for \r\nsuch imbalances could be found in proceedings before \r\nnational courts. Yet that has not been the case. Although, \r\n15-30992 15/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nfor instance, both the ICTY and the International Court \r\nof Justice have recognized that the civilian population \r\nof Serb ethnic origin was exposed to random murders \r\nduring and after Croatia’s military Operation Storm in \r\n1995, only one person in that country has been finally \r\nconvicted for the war crime of murder so far.\r\nNonetheless, the ICTY report deals readily with \r\nthe trials in Serbia and in Bosnia and Herzegovina, but \r\nnot in Croatia. At the same time, Croatia denies the \r\njurisdiction of Serbian judicial bodies to prosecute war \r\ncrimes committed in the territory of another country. \r\nWhat is that, then, if not an attempt to establish impunity \r\nfor its citizens? A similar selective approach has become \r\never more visible in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and the \r\nfailure to prosecute Kosovo Albanians for war crimes \r\nhas been clearly recognized by the establishment of a \r\nnew internationalized judicial mechanism to prosecute \r\nsuch cases.\r\nThrough its cooperation with the ICTY over the \r\npast 15 years Serbia has made a significant contribution \r\nto the system of international criminal justice. Yet we \r\ndid not expect that justice would remain selective. \r\nSerbia fully supports that part of the ICTY report in \r\nwhich the States are called upon to improve regional \r\ncooperation in that field. Moreover, we believe that in \r\nthe interests of international justice, a mechanism is \r\nneeded for strict and constant international monitoring \r\nof such cooperation. My country has nothing to hide, \r\nand we expect other Governments to take the same \r\napproach.\r\nAnother open question for Serbia in that process is \r\nthe overall humanitarian status of its citizens who have \r\nbeen convicted by the ICTY and are serving sentences \r\nin various countries under differing penal regimes and \r\ntreatment programmes. While international criminal \r\nlaw has been highly developed by the ICTY case law, it \r\nis true that international penology does not exist today, \r\nas such.\r\nIt must be noted that the United Nations has \r\ndone almost nothing in that field. The first results of \r\nthe research conducted into that issue show that the \r\nconvicted persons, most often politicians, army generals \r\nand other Government officials, have not been accorded \r\nany special treatment reflective of the specific nature of \r\ntheir responsibility. Many of them serve their sentences \r\nin penitentiaries that are thousands of kilometres \r\naway from their countries and their societies. They \r\ndo not understand the language or the culture of the \r\nprison community. And, as stated in the reports of the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, they do not \r\nreceive regular visits by their families. It makes them \r\ndoubly isolated — from outside society and from prison \r\ninmates.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThey also frequently protest the medical treatment \r\nthat they receive, most often because they don’t \r\nunderstand the medical standards of the societies in \r\nwhich the prisons are situated. They also do not have \r\nlegal aid conforming to the specific international \r\njudicial procedure under which they have been \r\nconvicted. For that reason, in 2009 Serbia asked to sign \r\nthe agreement on the enforcement of ICTY sentences \r\nin order to be added to the list of countries in which the \r\nsentences are enforced. But, even though my country \r\nis a party to such an agreement with the International \r\nCriminal Court, its request to the United Nations with \r\nrespect to that matter has never been properly attended \r\nto. The failure to address those questions and provide a \r\nresponse to the request has had a negative effect on the \r\ngeneral attitude of Serbian society towards the ICTY, \r\nits work and its legacy.\r\nMr. Manongi (United Republic of Tanzania): At \r\nthe outset, the United Republic of Tanzania reaffirms \r\nits strong support for the International Criminal \r\nTribunals for Rwanda and the former Yugoslavia and \r\nthe International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals and wishes to extend its appreciation to \r\nJudge Vagn Joensen, President of the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR), and to Judge \r\nTheodor Meron, President of the International Residual \r\nMechanism for Criminal Tribunals, for their briefings \r\ntoday. We note with gratitude the progress achieved in \r\nthe activities of the Tribunals during the period under \r\nreview.\r\nThe United Republic of Tanzania acknowledges \r\nthe efforts of the ICTR and the International Tribunal \r\nfor the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to implement \r\ntheir completion strategies. We are gratified that the \r\nResidual Mechanism has now assumed responsibility \r\nfor many functions. While the transition is going well, \r\nsome critical work remains to be done. We are pleased \r\nto note that the formal closure of the ICTR is on track \r\nfor 31 December, with only liquidation activities \r\nremaining.\r\nHowever, as the closure of the ICTR approaches, \r\nwe must remain mindful of the plight of the persons \r\n16/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nreleased or acquitted by the Tribunal, who deserve \r\nrelocation as a legitimate entitlement of law and justice. \r\nWe are pleased to note that, in the bid to implement \r\nits completion strategy, the ICTY has continued with \r\nthe process of downsizing its operations and the \r\ntransfer of responsibilities to the International Residual \r\nMechanism. The fact that only seven cases — four \r\ntrials and three appeals —remain demonstrates the \r\nTribunal’s commitment to completing its mandate \r\nexpeditiously and in accordance with due process. My \r\ndelegation calls for the same levels of support at their \r\nclosure as we provided at their inception.\r\nWe also commend the support rendered by the \r\nLegal Counsel and the Office of Legal Affairs of the \r\nUnited Nations Secretariat, as well as the Security \r\nCouncil Informal Working Group on International \r\nTribunals, in ensuring the continued smooth transition \r\nof the Tribunal’s functions to the Residual Mechanism.\r\nLast year the Tribunal marked its twentieth \r\nanniversary, and as it prepares to close its work by \r\nthis year’s end, it would be remiss on our part as a host \r\ncountry if we failed to recognize the great legacy that \r\nthe Tribunal has left to international criminal law in the \r\nregion and the international community. The Tribunal \r\nhas not only enriched jurisprudence and law practice \r\nthrough its seminal work but has also served as a \r\nresearch, learning and educational hub for universities, \r\ncolleges, high schools and local and international courts \r\nin the area of international criminal law.\r\nThroughout its existence the ICTR has sustained its \r\nefforts to transfer expertise and information to national \r\nand regional authorities with a view to building capacity \r\nin national criminal justice sectors. It has also shared \r\nthe lessons learned and best practices developed from \r\nits work with national counterparts. That has added \r\ngreat value to international judicial practice not only in \r\nthe region but worldwide.\r\nThe report of the Residual Mechanism (see \r\nA/70/225) reflects its tireless efforts to develop a \r\nstructure to govern its activities, mindful of the \r\nneed to develop rules, procedures and policies that \r\nharmonize and build upon the best practices of both \r\nthe ICTR and the ICTY. We are pleased to note that \r\nthe Residual Mechanism has continued to operate \r\nfrom its two branches in Arusha and in The Hague. It \r\nis commendable that, as the Tribunals complete their \r\nwork and progressively downsize their operations, the \r\nMechanism is gearing up and relying less and less on \r\nthe support services of the two Tribunals and continues \r\nthe process of establishing its own small, standing \r\nadministration.\r\nObviously, the common administration of the \r\ntwo branches located in two continents poses unique \r\nchallenges. We urge the Residual Mechanism to \r\nbe sensitive to its operational costs, with a view to \r\ndischarging its mandate fully and efficiently. We also \r\ncall on the Mechanism to continue to work closely with \r\nthe Tribunals’ principals and staff so as to ensure a \r\nsmooth transition of the remaining functions.\r\nAs we commend measures taken by the Residual \r\nMechanism and the two Tribunals consistent with their \r\ntransitional arrangements, we wish to renew the appeal \r\nto the international community to continue cooperating \r\nwith both the Mechanism and the Tribunals to ensure \r\nthe arrest of the remaining fugitives and the timely \r\nreallocation of acquitted persons and those who \r\nhave completed their sentences. In the meantime, \r\nthe Government of the United Republic of Tanzania \r\nwill continue to extend the necessary support to the \r\nMechanism and the Tribunals.\r\nThe practical arrangements made by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral pursuant to Security Council resolution 1966 \r\n(2010) to ensure that the operations of the Residual \r\nMechanism commence are, in our view, quite \r\nadmirable. It is our firm conviction that, with the active \r\nsteps taken by the Secretary-General and the support of \r\nMember States, the resources necessary to implement \r\nthe projects must be approved and dispersed so that \r\nthe premises for the Arusha branch of the Mechanism \r\nwill be completed in a timely manner and occupied as \r\nplanned.\r\nFor our part, the Government of Tanzania has \r\nprovided the necessary infrastructure, including land \r\ncommissioned by His Excellency President Kikwete \r\nearly this July. We have also provided access roads and \r\nelectricity and have nearly completed the provision of \r\nwater and other services, including cable connections \r\nfor the Internet.\r\nIn closing, we wish to commend the ICTR, its \r\njudges and staff for their dedication and commitment. \r\nWe also want to reiterate our sincere appreciation to the \r\ninternational community for the trust and confidence \r\nbestowed upon Tanzania to host the ICTR for the past \r\n20 years since the tragedy of the genocide in Rwanda. \r\nThe establishment of the ICTR and the ICTY was a sad \r\nreminder of the worst instincts of the human being. It \r\n15-30992 17/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nmust also be a reminder that “never again” must mean \r\nwhat it says, and not “again and again”.\r\nMr. Gorostegui Obanoz (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nChile wishes once again to acknowledge the work of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and \r\nthe International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, as well \r\nas the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals, aware of their significant contributions to \r\ninternational justice and the progressive development \r\nof international law since the creation of the Tribunals. \r\nWe are grateful to the Presidents of the Tribunals \r\nfor their leadership, and through them we thank the \r\nProsecutors, Registrars and all those who have served \r\nthe Tribunals, which are already considered to serve as \r\na model in the fight for accountability and for ending \r\nimpunity.\r\nWe welcome with great satisfaction the news that \r\nthe work of the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda will conclude in Tanzania in December. Chile \r\nreiterates the need for international cooperation so \r\nthat a solution can be found, both for the 11 acquitted \r\nindividuals who are still in safe houses in Arusha and \r\nneed to be relocated, as well as for the nine indictees \r\nwho are still at large, six of them under the jurisdiction \r\nof Rwanda and three under the jurisdiction of the \r\nResidual Mechanism.\r\nIn the case of the International Tribunal for the \r\nFormer Yugoslavia, which is scheduled to close in \r\n2017, while we understand there are still some pending \r\nchallenges for its completion strategy, we are confident \r\nthat all members of the international community, \r\nin particular the Security Council, will provide the \r\nsupport needed for it to fulfil its mandate and to ensure \r\nthe proper functioning of the Residual Mechanism with \r\nregard to both Tribunals, as has been the case so far.\r\nLastly, we encourage the development of best \r\npractices in international criminal justice for all \r\nMembers of the United Nations, and we advocate \r\nappropriate support for and implementation of the \r\nprinciples of universal jurisdiction and complementarity.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): Croatia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union. In addition, I should like to add \r\nseveral remarks in my national capacity.\r\nAllow me to commend the Presidents of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \r\n(ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda (ICTR), Judges Meron and Joensen, on their \r\nwork and their continued efforts to ensure accountability \r\nand promote international criminal justice. As always, \r\nthey can count on Croatia’s continued and unwavering \r\nsupport. Croatia stresses the importance of the \r\ncompletion of the remaining ICTY trials in the cases of \r\nKaradžić, Mladić, Šešelj and Hadžić, and we encourage \r\nthe Tribunal to maximize its efforts in that regard.\r\nTogether, the ICTY and the ICTR represent a \r\nbreakthrough in the development of international \r\ncriminal law, in improving international criminal \r\nprocedure and in narrowing the impunity gap. The \r\nvoices of the victims are being heard, and historical \r\nrecords established. That in itself is not a small \r\nachievement. The two Tribunals have set high standards \r\nof responsibility for war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and genocide. And, equally important, they \r\nhave paved the way for the creation of the International \r\nCriminal Court, which Croatia strongly supports.\r\nAllow me to make a brief comment on the subject of \r\nVojislav Šešelj, who is notorious for his war-mongering \r\nand was indicted by the ICTY for war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity. He was provisionally \r\nreleased for humanitarian reasons, as provided by the \r\nRules of Procedure and Evidence. Upon his return \r\nto Serbia, Šešelj continued with his inflammatory \r\nspeeches and provocations. The fact that this indicted \r\nwar criminal recently appeared in a television reality \r\nshow is something that defies any legal logic and moral \r\ncomprehension. As we said in the Security Council \r\ndebate — and I will repeat it again today — it is utterly \r\nunacceptable and insulting.\r\nCroatia believes that international and regional \r\ncooperation in criminal matters, when pursued in \r\naccordance with the basic principles and rules of \r\ninternational law, including international criminal law, \r\nrepresents a sound basis for the successful investigation, \r\nprosecution and punishment of the perpetrators of core \r\ninternational crimes.\r\nAs regards universal jurisdiction, a powerful \r\nsubsidiary tool for ending impunity, a State \r\nimplementing universal jurisdiction needs, first and \r\nforemost, to observe its universal character. At the \r\nsame time, a State implementing universal jurisdiction \r\nshould also fully respect the principle of subsidiarity and \r\nimplement it in good faith, in a reasonable, predictable \r\nand responsible manner and in accordance with all \r\nthe applicable rules and fundamental principles of the \r\nvarious fields of international law and international \r\ncomity.\r\n18/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nIn that regard, we encourage Serbia to introduce \r\nin its legislation universal jurisdiction for core \r\ninternational crimes in its proper form and to follow \r\nthe aforementioned principles for its implementation. \r\nSerbia’s current legislation — the Law on the \r\nOrganization and Competences of Government \r\nAuthorities in War Crimes Proceedings — is, \r\nunfortunately, neither universal, since it applies only to \r\na specifically defined number of neighbouring States, \r\nnor subsidiary, since it applies irrespective of the basic \r\nprinciples for the application of universal jurisdiction. \r\nSerbia’s legally f lawed precedent — no other State \r\nhas ever extended or attempted to extend its criminal \r\njurisdiction in such a manner to only a limited number \r\nof its neighbours — hampers not only the desired \r\nregional cooperation but, ultimately, also its main \r\npurpose, namely, the effective fight against impunity.\r\nA genuine commitment to ending impunity for the \r\nmost serious violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw can take various forms — in this case, for example, \r\nby applying the principle of active personality, since \r\nmost of those accused of such crimes are Serbian \r\nnationals. Far less often, in those cases involving \r\nnationals of Serbia’s neighbouring countries, the \r\nproper application of the existing mutual assistance \r\nmechanisms between States in criminal matters — and \r\nin particular bilateral agreements and acts in force, as \r\nwell as international comity — is more than sufficient.\r\nAs has already been stated in previous debates on \r\nthis pivotal matter, the important legacy of the ICTY \r\nis not entirely without f laws. Nevertheless, that should \r\nin no way tarnish the Tribunal’s historical record but \r\nshould rather serve as an important lesson to be learned \r\nfor the benefit of international criminal justice in the \r\nfuture.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reiterate Croatia’s \r\nindisputable support for the work of the Tribunals. The \r\nwork of the ICTY is not over yet. Some of the indictees \r\nmost responsible for war crimes are still waiting for a \r\nverdict to be brought down in their cases. It has been \r\nsaid many times that justice delayed is justice denied. A \r\nspeedy trial resulting in a court decision, a conviction \r\nor an acquittal, represents not only one of the most \r\nessential rights of the accused, but is also an equally \r\nessential right of the victims. So we hope that the \r\nverdicts and justice still pending and long overdue will \r\nbe served soon.\r\nMr. Musikhin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I would like to thank the leadership of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia \r\n(ICTY) and the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nRwanda (ICTR) for the annual reports on their activities \r\n(see A/70/226 and A/70/218, respectively) submitted \r\nto the General Assembly and also for the third report \r\nof the International Residual Mechanism for Criminal \r\nTribunals (see A/70/225).\r\nWe acknowledge the information provided by \r\nthe leadership of the Tribunals and the Residual \r\nMechanism on the progress of proceedings, the rates \r\nof their completion processes, and their conversion \r\ninto the Mechanism. We are paying close attention \r\nto that information, given that, as is well known, \r\nneither Tribunal has been able to complete its work \r\nin accordance with the timelines set out in Security \r\nCouncil resolution 1966 (2010). In the light of that fact, \r\nwe welcome the confirmation that the Rwanda Tribunal, \r\nalthough its closure has been delayed, will close by the \r\nend of this year.\r\nAt the ICTY the situation remains more complex. \r\nHaving analysed the report, we have become even more \r\nconvinced that that Tribunal has the potential to further \r\nreduce the duration of its proceedings. However, in \r\nspite of the urgent appeals to the Tribunal to redouble \r\nefforts in that area, in Security Council resolution 2193 \r\n(2014), the expected reduction has not occurred. That \r\nstate of affairs is unacceptable. \r\nStaffing problems, to which we again see references \r\nin the ICTY report, are hardly adequate to explain the \r\nsituation. Indeed, there is an objective need to replace \r\nworkers with new staff members, but we believe that it \r\nis quite possible to arrange the transfer of cases without \r\ncausing harm to the quality and speed of the work. \r\nOther reasons for new delays, which are referred to in \r\nthe report, are also difficult to call force majeure.\r\nWe would like to comment separately on the \r\nsituation of the accused individuals who have serious \r\nhealth issues. The Trial Chambers and the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor of the ICTY could think about how \r\nnecessary and realistic it is to continue such trials. In that \r\nconnection they could take the appropriate decisions, \r\nbearing in mind humanitarian considerations. We hope \r\nthat, in the near future, the leadership of the ICTY will \r\nbe able to correct the situation and avoid new delays, \r\nas well as reduce the projected time periods needed to \r\nwrap up the trials. The progress achieved on that issue \r\nstill needs to be considered in the coming months by \r\nthe Security Council.\r\n15-30992 19/20\r\n13/10/2015 A/70/PV.31\r\nWe are still cautiously optimistic concerning the \r\nwork of the Residual Mechanism. During the reporting \r\nperiod, its first ruling was handed down, and there \r\nhas been progress in performing other functions \r\nnot completed by the Tribunals. We expect that the \r\nMechanism will show maximum efficiency in its \r\nactivities, given the temporary nature of its mandate \r\nestablished by Security Council resolution 1966 (2010).\r\nIn that context, the review of the Mechanism’s \r\nactivities over its first four years — which the Security \r\nCouncil is to complete by 1 July 2016, in accordance \r\nwith paragraph 17 of its resolution 1966 (2010) — is \r\nof great importance. There will be a serious analysis \r\nof the situation in the Mechanism, in connection with \r\nwhich the review should be conducted in conformity \r\nwith the directives of the resolution and the objectives \r\nset out therein.\r\nMr. Sana (Rwanda): I too thank Judge Meron and \r\nJudge Joensen for their presentations. At the outset let \r\nme acknowledge the important progress made by both \r\nTribunals towards their completion and transition to the \r\nMechanism.\r\nAs the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda \r\n(ICTR) is winding down, we express our belief that it \r\nplays an important role in the fight against impunity for \r\nmass atrocities, but that it also produced a substantial \r\nbody of jurisprudence, including a definition of the \r\ncrime of genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes, as well as support responsibility. Most \r\nimportantly, the Tribunal established that the genocide \r\nthat occurred in Rwanda was committed against the \r\nTutsi as a group and also ruled that acts of rape and \r\nsexual violence constituted a crime of genocide if \r\ncommitted with the intent of destroying the targeted \r\ngroup.\r\nDespite the progress made, much more still needs \r\nto be done. As we look forward to the conclusion of the \r\nButare cases by the Appellate Chambers, which were \r\ndelayed unnecessarily, we note that the 93 individuals \r\nindicted for genocide were mainly the masterminds \r\nof those crimes, as well as national and local leaders, \r\nwho were out of reach of Rwandan justice as they were \r\ninternational fugitives. We regret, however, that nine \r\nfugitives, among them the well-known Félicien Kabuga, \r\nare still at large, and we reiterate our call to Member \r\nStates, especially those in our region, to collaborate in \r\nensuring the arrest of all remaining genocide fugitives, \r\nas per Security Council resolution 2150 (2014).\r\nRegarding the monitoring of the four cases referred \r\nto national courts, we regret that the report under review, \r\nas well as the oral presentations made today, do not \r\nprovide enough details on the state of those cases. While \r\nthe procedures in the two cases referred to Rwanda in \r\n2012 and 2013 are well advanced and on the right track, \r\nwe are extremely concerned at the delays encountered \r\nin the investigation into the two cases referred to France \r\nin 2007. We especially regret and express our deepest \r\ndisappointment at the announcement of the dismissal \r\non 2 October this year of the case against Wenceslas \r\nMunyeshyaka. The diligence with which Germany, \r\non the other hand, has tried the case of the Rwandan \r\nleaders of the genocidal militia, Forces démocratiques \r\nde libération du Rwanda, is exemplary.\r\nOn many occasions Rwanda has expressed its view \r\nthat the ICTR archives, although the property of the \r\nUnited Nations, should be transferred to Rwanda upon \r\ncompletion of the Residual Mechanism’s mandate. \r\nIndeed, the ICTR records constitute an integral part of \r\nRwandan history and are vital to the preservation of \r\nthe memory of the genocide. They will play a critical \r\nrole in preserving current and future generations \r\nfrom genocide, denial and revisionism. We hope that \r\nall stakeholders will understand our request and act \r\naccordingly.\r\nI should like to conclude by again thanking the \r\nICTR and ICTY for their efforts to ensure justice and \r\naccountability for the most serious crimes. We hope \r\nthat the Residual Mechanism will, with the support \r\nof the international community, be able to arrest the \r\nremaining fugitives and bring them to justice.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on the agenda items before us.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the Assembly \r\nto take note of the twentieth annual report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for the Prosecution \r\nof Persons Responsible for Genocide and Other \r\nSerious Violations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of Rwanda and Rwandan \r\nCitizens Responsible for Genocide and Other Such \r\nViolations Committed in the Territory of Neighbouring \r\nStates between 1 January and 31 December 1994 (see \r\nA/70/218)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I also take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the Assembly to take note of the twenty-\r\n20/20 15-30992\r\nA/70/PV.31 13/10/2015\r\nsecond annual report of the International Tribunal for \r\nthe Prosecution of Persons Responsible for Serious \r\nViolations of International Humanitarian Law \r\nCommitted in the Territory of the Former Yugoslavia \r\nsince 1991 (see A/70/226)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the Assembly to take note of the third annual \r\nreport of the International Residual Mechanism for \r\nCriminal Tribunals (see A/70/225)?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: As this stage of the work \r\ncomes to a close, I should like to express my sincere \r\ngratitude to Judge Vagn Joensen for his service in the \r\nInternational Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda, and to \r\nJudge Theodor Meron for his service in the International \r\nTribunal for the Former Yugoslavia.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda items \r\n76, 77 and 128?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.15 p.m.\r\n"
