I would \r\nlike to make a few preliminary remarks in order to \r\nintroduce the report.\r\nThe Secretary-General presented his report prior to \r\nthe start of the general debate, which we all attended \r\nsome weeks ago. In his introduction to the report, the \r\nSecretary-General highlighted many of the overarching \r\nchallenges and concerns that confront the United \r\nNations in its seventieth year. The report speaks to \r\nmany of the points that Member States subsequently \r\nraised during the general debate. It is clear that its \r\nthemes resonate with Member States and will continue \r\nto dominate our work during the seventieth session. \r\nThe report covers the eight priority areas agreed \r\non by the Committee for Programme and Coordination, \r\nand I would like to briefly highlight the key themes in \r\neach area.\r\nIn the area of sustainable development, the report \r\nincludes a reminder of the gaps in and lessons of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals as we embark on the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), and a clear call for a meaningful, universal \r\nclimate agreement. \r\nThe report presents a sobering picture where \r\npeace and security are concerned, noting that we face \r\nincreasingly complex and interconnected threats. \r\nThe narrative on Africa is positive, noting the \r\nsignificant strides that the continent has made in \r\ndevelopment during the past year.\r\nIn the area of human rights, the report f lags the \r\nexposure of millions of innocent people to gross risks \r\nand violations, including the worst displacement of \r\npersons — we are talking about 51 million people — seen \r\nsince the Second World War, and reminds us of the \r\npriority the Secretary-General gives to the Human \r\nRights Up Front initiative. \r\nWith regard to humanitarian assistance, the \r\nreport laments that this year we hit several deplorable \r\nhumanitarian benchmarks, including the figure of \r\nmore than 76 million people in need of humanitarian \r\nassistance, and calls on us not just to meet humanitarian \r\nneeds but to reduce them.\r\nThe report reminds us of the importance of the rule \r\nof law at the national and international levels. \r\nAs for disarmament, the report shows a mixed \r\npicture, with multilateral disarmament forums \r\nstruggling to deliver results. In that regard, we all \r\nremember this year’s Review Conference of the Parties \r\nto the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.32\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n32nd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 14 October 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

However, we also witnessed a welcome \r\nagreement on Iran’s nuclear capacity and the entry into \r\nforce of the Arms Trade Treaty.\r\nThe report acknowledges the spread of international \r\nterrorism and the related problems of drug trafficking \r\nand organized crime, owing to a continuing failure to \r\nresolve the underlying conflicts and conditions that \r\ngive rise to violent extremism, as well as to the limits \r\nof conventional approaches to such problems.\r\nFinally, the report includes an update on steps \r\nbeing taken to strengthen the Organization in order \r\nto adapt it to new needs and realities, including the \r\nimplementation of the International Public Sector \r\nAccounting Standards and Umoja, as well as a decision \r\nto further consider internally how best to achieve the \r\nobjectives for which partnerships are proposed.\r\nThe report concludes that on the occasion of its \r\nseventieth anniversary, the United Nations is needed \r\nmore than ever before, and that will require an \r\nunprecedented spirit of cooperation among Member \r\nStates. The Secretary-General stands ready to do his \r\npart and looks forward to hearing the views of Member \r\nStates during our debate.\r\nMr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): I have the honour \r\nto deliver this statement on behalf of the 10 States \r\nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN): Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, the \r\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my \r\nown country, Malaysia.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his annual report on the work of the \r\nOrganization, contained in document A/70/1. It \r\nprovides a comprehensive and detailed overview of \r\nthe activities of the Organization, its achievements and \r\nchallenges, across a wide spectrum of issues relating to \r\nthe common interests and concerns of all humankind.\r\nThe ASEAN Charter has a provision expressing \r\nthe Association’s commitment to upholding the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law. Therefore \r\nASEAN attaches great importance to the work of the \r\nUnited Nations and greatly values its cooperation \r\nwith the Organization. The Joint Declaration on \r\nComprehensive Partnership between ASEAN and the \r\nUnited Nations, adopted in 2011, is a clear reflection \r\nof our commitment to strengthening our cooperation. \r\nIn that context, we welcome the success of the annual \r\nmeeting of the ASEAN Foreign Ministers with the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, on 29 September on \r\nthe sidelines of the general debate. \r\nASEAN looks forward to welcoming the Secretary-\r\nGeneral at the upcoming seventh ASEAN-United \r\nNations Summit, to be held on 22 November in Kuala \r\nLumpur, with the goal of further strengthening relations \r\nbetween the organizations and exploring other areas of \r\ncooperation. We view the Summit as an effective policy \r\ntool and another opportunity to give policy guidance \r\nfor strengthening our partnership.\r\nIn his report, the Secretary-General highlights \r\nthe substantial progress that has been made overall on \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, while stressing \r\nthe importance of moving forward with the universal \r\nimplementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), as well as the urgent \r\nneed for taking timely action on climate change.\r\nThe start of the seventieth session of the General \r\nAssembly is the precursor to a more challenging process. \r\nASEAN is encouraged that the aforementioned ASEAN \r\nForeign Ministers’ meeting recognized the importance \r\nof the implementation of the ASEAN community’s \r\npost-2015 vision alongside that of the 2030 Agenda. We \r\nshare the view that the two agendas will complement \r\neach other, particularly in the areas of reducing poverty \r\nand hunger, tackling inequalities and promoting \r\nwomen’s empowerment, fostering sustainable economic \r\ngrowth and equitable social development, protecting \r\nthe environment, ensuring access to clean water and \r\nair, minimizing the adverse effects of climate change \r\nand building effective institutions aimed at achieving \r\nsustainable and inclusive development, as well as \r\nin enhancing the collaboration between the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies with ASEAN’s \r\nvarious mechanisms and institutions.\r\nThere is no doubt that climate change, as the \r\nSecretary-General points out, is one of the greatest \r\nthreats we have to a sustainable future. ASEAN is \r\nalso working hard to address that challenge, including \r\nby strengthening its community’s resilience through \r\neffective implementation of its Climate Change \r\nInitiative and Action Plan on a Joint Response to Climate \r\nChange. We hope that the upcoming Climate Change \r\nConference, to be held in Paris between 30 November \r\nand 11 December, will produce a comprehensive and \r\nuniversal agreement on climate change under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\r\n15-31290 3/16\r\n14/10/2015 A/70/PV.32\r\nIn the area of human rights, ASEAN has made \r\nrapid progress with its institutional development since \r\nits Charter entered into force. Highlights include the \r\n2012 adoption of ASEAN’s milestone Human Rights \r\nDeclaration and its 2013 Declaration on the Elimination \r\nof Violence Against Women and Children, following \r\nthe establishment of the ASEAN Intergovernmental \r\nCommission on Human Rights (AICHR) and \r\nCommission on the Promotion and Protection of the \r\nRights of Women and Children.\r\nThe AICHR conducts various programmes and \r\nactivities in consultation and cooperation with ASEAN \r\nsectoral bodies, together with the relevant institutions \r\nand external partners concerned. The AICHR has \r\nlaunched various initiatives to promote awareness of \r\nhuman rights in 2015. Among them are the AICHR \r\nTraining of the Trainers for Journalists in ASEAN \r\nMember States, held in Thailand; the AICHR Youth \r\nDebates on Human Rights, held in Singapore; the \r\nRegional Workshop on the Role of Youth in Promoting \r\nHuman Rights in ASEAN, to be held in Malaysia; the \r\nAICHR Workshop on the Implementation of Human \r\nRights Obligations Relating to the Environment and \r\nClimate Change, held in Myanmar; and the AICHR \r\nWorkshop on the Development of ASEAN Legal \r\nInstruments on Human Rights, held in the Philippines.\r\nConcerning peace and stability, ASEAN also strives \r\nto maintain and promote the Association as a f lag-\r\nbearer for regional norms of good conduct, particularly \r\nthrough the Treaty of Amity and Cooperation in \r\nSoutheast Asia. The Treaty is regarded as the key \r\ncode of conduct governing inter-State relations in \r\nSouth-East Asia, and it provides the foundations for \r\nthe maintenance of regional peace and stability. We \r\nwelcome the growing interest of some non-ASEAN \r\nStates in acceding to the Treaty.\r\nFurthermore, ASEAN attaches great importance \r\nto strengthening the nuclear non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament regime in order to maintain peace, \r\nsecurity and prosperity in the region. We are \r\ncommitted to preserving South-East Asia as a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone and free of all other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, as enshrined in the ASEAN Charter. In \r\nthat regard, ASEAN is committed to working closely \r\nwith the nuclear-weapon States on their early signing \r\nand ratification of the Protocol to the Treaty on the \r\nSouth-East Asia Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone, without \r\nreservations. To that end, ASEAN encourages the full \r\nsupport of United Nations Member States, particularly \r\nthe nuclear-weapon States, for the ASEAN-sponsored \r\nbiennial resolutions on the Treaty during the seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nOn counter-terrorism, ASEAN shares the deep \r\nconcerns over the rising violence and brutality \r\ncommitted by terrorist and extremist organizations \r\nand radical groups in Yemen, Iraq and Syria. ASEAN \r\ndenounces all acts of destruction, violence and \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. Along \r\nthose lines, ASEAN adopted the Langkawi Declaration \r\non the Global Movement of Moderates at the twenty-\r\nsixth ASEAN Summit, held in April, which outlines \r\nmeasures to promote moderation and curb extremism \r\nthroughout the region.\r\nThis year, under Malaysia’s chairmanship and the \r\ntheme “Our People, Our Community, Our Vision”, \r\nwe are striving to make ASEAN people-centred. That \r\nmeans good governance, higher standards of living, \r\nsustainable development, the empowerment of women \r\nand greater opportunity for all people, in the spirit of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We \r\nbelieve that the collective efforts of ASEAN at the \r\nregional level will contribute to the work of the United \r\nNations in promoting peace, security and stability as \r\nwell as to inclusive and sustainable growth for all.\r\nI wish to conclude by reiterating ASEAN’s resolve \r\nto strengthen cooperation with the United Nations in \r\nthe areas of mutual interest.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/70/1).\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe founding of the United Nations. Over the past \r\n70 years, the United Nations has borne witness to the \r\nendeavours of Member States to explore and put into \r\npractice various ways of maintaining peace, promoting \r\ndevelopment and seeking cooperation. Reviewing the \r\njourney the United Nations has taken, we are extremely \r\nproud of its achievements. Looking forward, we are \r\nfully confident of the ability of the Organization to \r\nlaunch a new era of cooperation.\r\nOver the past year, the United Nations has \r\nproactively advanced multilateral cooperation \r\nand formulated the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) with a view to promoting \r\neconomic growth and sustainable development. It has \r\n4/16 15-31290\r\nA/70/PV.32 14/10/2015\r\nworked to find solutions so as to reach hotspot issues \r\nthrough diplomatic negotiations and made efforts in \r\nboth peacekeeping and peacebuilding. It has actively \r\ncoordinated humanitarian assistance and appropriately \r\naddressed the Ebola outbreak. It advanced the cause of \r\ndisarmament in a comprehensive manner and facilitated \r\nthe development of synergy in the international fight \r\nagainst terrorism. China wishes to thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and the Secretariat as a whole \r\nfor all their efforts.\r\nThe world we currently live in is far from \r\ntranquil, with ongoing regional conflicts, local wars \r\nand numerous difficulties on the path towards global \r\ndevelopment. The international community continues \r\nto face daunting traditional and non-traditional \r\nchallenges. In this especially significant year, we need \r\nto reflect on how to better address the major issues \r\nof peace and development in the twenty-first century, \r\nincluding how to promote the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of peoples throughout the world and \r\nadvance our common values of peace, development, \r\nequity and justice.\r\nDuring his attendance at various summits in the \r\ncontext of the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations, the President of the People’s Republic of \r\nChina, Mr. Xi Jinping, gave an in-depth account of \r\nChina’s policy view on the international order and \r\nissues concerning the future and destiny of humankind, \r\nas well as a comprehensive elaboration on the idea for \r\na new type of international relations with win-win \r\ncooperation at its centre.\r\nHe proposed the establishment of a partnership \r\nin which countries treat each other as equals; \r\nengage in mutual consultations; demonstrate mutual \r\nunderstanding; create a security architecture that \r\nstresses fairness, justice, joint contributions and \r\nshared benefits; seek inclusive and mutually beneficial \r\ndevelopment characterized by openness and innovation; \r\ncarry out intercivilizational exchanges to promote \r\nharmony, inclusiveness and respect for differences; \r\nand construct ecological systems that respect nature \r\nand favour green development. Based on these points, \r\nwe can draw up a blueprint and road map for building \r\na community for the common destiny of humankind. \r\nThose ideas preserve and further develop the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nprovide new thinking and a new vision for the future \r\nwork of the Organization.\r\nIn the political and security sphere, China believes \r\nthat all countries should have a role in determining \r\nthe future of the world, and that the principle of \r\nsovereignty should be respected and implemented. \r\nDisputes should be settled through dialogue and \r\ndifferences bridged through consultations. We must \r\nadhere to multilateralism and approach the idea of \r\nwin-win cooperation and winning for all. China has \r\nalso proposed an important initiative for strengthening \r\nthe United Nations peacekeeping operations and \r\noffered China’s programmes as contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations work in the area of peace and security.\r\nIn the area of development, China advocates \r\na development concept of equity, openness, \r\ncomprehensiveness and innovation at its core. We have \r\nput forward four policy proposals for building countries’ \r\ndevelopment capacities, improving the international \r\ndevelopment environment, optimizing development \r\npartnerships and boosting development coordination \r\nmechanisms, which also represent China’s philosophy \r\nfor its own development and reform.\r\nWe have expressed our views on the direction of \r\nclimate change negotiations and introduced our specific \r\nmeasures to conserve energy and reduce greenhouse gas \r\nemissions. That will facilitate the integration of China’s \r\ndevelopment with that of the world, thereby providing \r\nnew thinking and injecting new vitality into the efforts \r\nof the United Nations to promote global development.\r\nWith regard to women’s empowerment, China has \r\nput forward four ideas to promote gender equality and \r\nwomen’s all-around development: advancing women’s \r\ndevelopment in parallel with economic and social \r\ndevelopment, actively safeguarding women’s rights \r\nand interests, working to foster a harmonious and \r\nsocially inclusive culture, and creating an international \r\nenvironment favourable to women’s development. At \r\nthe joint initiative of the United Nations and China, \r\nthose commitments were made for the first time at the \r\nlevel of State leaders, which is of historic significance.\r\nChina has announced a series of major initiatives to \r\nsupport the work of the United Nations and advance the \r\ncause of global peace and development. China will join the \r\nnew United Nations peacekeeping standby mechanism \r\nand has established standing formed police units and an \r\n8,000-strong standby peacekeeping contingent. China \r\nwill set up a South-South cooperation assistance fund \r\nwith an initial funding level of $2 billion to support \r\ndeveloping countries in implementing the 2030 Agenda \r\n15-31290 5/16\r\n14/10/2015 A/70/PV.32\r\nfor Sustainable Development. China will donate \r\n$10 million to UN-Women to implement 100 mother-\r\nand-child health projects in developing countries over \r\nthe next five years. China has also decided to establish \r\na 10-year, $1 billion China-United Nations development \r\nfund. All these initiatives demonstrate China’s sense of \r\nresponsibility for multilateral cooperation.\r\nThe outcomes of the United Nations summits have \r\nset out the direction for our efforts to build a better \r\ntomorrow and for the future of the world and the United \r\nNations. China is ready to work with all Member States \r\nto turn the outcomes of the summits into concrete \r\naction and to jointly strive for a bright future in which \r\nall people will be free from want and enjoy development \r\nand dignity.\r\nChina believes that in the area of peace and security, \r\nthe United Nations should, during the Assembly’s \r\nseventieth session, resolutely uphold the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, respect \r\nthe choices made by countries themselves concerning \r\ntheir development path and social system, persist \r\nin seeking the settlement of inter-State disputes by \r\npeaceful means through dialogue and consultations, \r\nand strive for progress in addressing regional hotspot \r\nissues, such as the Middle East.\r\nIn the area of development, the United Nations \r\nshould seize this historic opportunity to advance global \r\ndevelopment. It should focus on the follow-up to the \r\n2030 Agenda, adhere to the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities, and push for coordinated \r\ndevelopment in the economic, social and environmental \r\nspheres in an effort to narrow the gap between North \r\nand South so that all countries can embark on the \r\npath towards equitable, inclusive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nAs a permanent member of the Security Council \r\nand the world’s largest developing country, China has \r\nalways considered the maintenance of world peace, the \r\npromotion of global development and the safeguarding \r\nof the world order to be its duties. For years, China has \r\nactively contributed Chinese wisdom, Chinese ideas \r\nand Chinese proposals to the international community, \r\nthereby contributing to the work of the United Nations. \r\nWe are willing to work with other Member States to \r\nuphold and develop the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter, build a new type of international relationship \r\nwith win-win cooperation at its centre, and create a \r\ncommunity of the common destiny of humankind, \r\nthereby making further and greater contributions to the \r\ncontinuing advance of the cause of peace, development \r\nand progress.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): We appreciate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/70/1), which presents a substantive assessment of \r\nthe activities of the United Nations over the past year \r\nand contains many reflections that we need to heed.\r\nThe world has been transformed fundamentally \r\nsince the United Nations was created 70 years ago. \r\nGeopolitics has changed; the nature of conflict has \r\nchanged; and so have the demands of peacekeeping. The \r\ndevelopment challenges of our time are qualitatively \r\ndifferent, while environmental threats have escalated to \r\nan unprecedented level. A review of the Organization, \r\nboth in the way it is structured and in the way it \r\noperates, was therefore much needed.\r\nOn development, Member States have, over the \r\npast few years, jointly reviewed the achievements \r\nand failures of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs). Lessons learned have informed the paradigm \r\nshift represented by the post-2015 development \r\nAgenda. In his report, the Secretary-General has \r\nacknowledged progress on the MDGs, while identifying \r\nthe significant gaps that have remained. Advances in \r\nmany areas have bypassed the poor; sometimes they \r\nhave even exacerbated inequities. Having collectively \r\ncommitted ourselves at last month’s historic summit \r\nto achieving a series of specific goals to promote \r\nequitable and inclusive development, focused action is \r\nnow needed to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. The challenge ahead is to summon and mobilize \r\nthe collective political will and resources to ensure the \r\ncomprehensive implementation of those Goals.\r\nIn the realm of peace and security, reviews of \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding are being undertaken \r\nin the same spirit of introspection. That is necessary in \r\na world that is in increasing turmoil. Peacekeeping has \r\nto respond to that and also adapt to the changing nature \r\nof conflict.\r\nPakistan believes that reform of the Organization \r\nis necessary to reflect the dynamics and demands of \r\nthe twenty-first century and to respond effectively to \r\nthe current and emerging challenges that confront us \r\nall. Pakistan supports comprehensive reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, including of the Security Council, \r\nbut such reform must make the Security Council \r\nmore democratic, representative, accountable and \r\ntransparent. As Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif said \r\n6/16 15-31290\r\nA/70/PV.32 14/10/2015\r\nduring the general debate: “We need a Security Council \r\nthat ... ref lects the interests of all Member States ... not \r\nan expanded club of the powerful and the privileged.” \r\n(A/70/PV.19, p. 40)\r\nThe primary purpose for the creation of the United \r\nNations was to save future generations from the \r\nscourge of war. Yet today we find a world under strain, \r\nwith peace elusive in many regions and security threats \r\nmagnifying or escalating in other parts. Confrontation \r\nhas returned between major Powers in Europe and \r\nthreatens to engulf Asia. Large parts of the Middle \r\nEast are in f lames. Terrorism is spreading. Violent \r\nextremism is on the rise. Indeed, the Middle East is \r\nconfronted with unprecedented security challenges as \r\nan increasing number of countries are being sucked into \r\nthe vortex of conflict and instability. Massive human \r\ndislocation and a growing refugee crisis threaten the \r\nstability of many parts of the world.\r\nDealing with all those threats and challenges \r\nrequires new and collective thinking, as well as \r\ncollaborative action at the regional and global levels. \r\nMeanwhile, the long-standing tragedy of Palestine has \r\nintensified. The intransigent stance of the occupying \r\nPower has dimmed any chances of progress towards the \r\nwidely accepted avenue for peace between Palestine \r\nand Israel, namely, a two-State solution.\r\nIn our ongoing battle against terrorism, Pakistan’s \r\ncommitment to eliminating that scourge is unwavering. \r\nWe have lost tens of thousands of lives to terrorism, \r\nbut the blood that has been shed, including that of our \r\ninnocent children, has only reinforced our resolve \r\nand our commitment to continuing the fight until the \r\nlast terrorist is eliminated from our country. Pakistan \r\nhas adopted a multi-pronged strategy that envisages \r\na comprehensive national action plan and a military-\r\nled law enforcement operation called Zarb-e-Azb \r\nto fight against terrorists. Zarb-e-Azb is the largest \r\nanti-terrorism campaign against terrorists anywhere in \r\nthe world and has already made substantial progress in \r\ncleansing my country of terrorism.\r\nIn our neighbourhood, we seek constructive \r\ndiplomatic engagement to resolve differences, \r\npromote stability and foster economic cooperation and \r\nconnectivity. Pakistan remains committed to promoting \r\npeace and stability in Afghanistan. We believe that a \r\npeace process aimed at intra-Afghan reconciliation \r\nis the only viable way to bring a political end to the \r\nlong-running conflict there. A promising start was \r\nmade in initiating such a process two months ago, but \r\nthat effort has since stalled. We stand ready to help \r\nrevive that process when requested to do so, and are \r\nencouraged that the international community wants to \r\nsee a resumption of the peace process in Afghanistan.\r\nIn South Asia, long-standing disputes have to be \r\naddressed boldly and decisively if enduring peace and \r\nstability are to be established. The unresolved Jammu \r\nand Kashmir dispute remains the root cause of tensions \r\nand instability in our region. For over half a century, \r\nthat dispute has remained unresolved. United Nations \r\nresolutions pledging a plebiscite to allow the Kashmiri \r\npeople to exercise their right to self-determination have \r\nnot been implemented. Instead, the people of Kashmir \r\nhave suffered brutal oppression.\r\nThe urgency of peacefully settling the dispute \r\nis even more compelling today. Consultations with \r\nKashmiris, who are an integral part of the dispute, \r\nare essential to evolving such a peaceful solution. \r\nCalling for the termination of those consultations as \r\na precondition for dialogue is unacceptable as well \r\nas counterproductive. Escalating tensions on the Line \r\nof Control in Kashmir and the working boundary \r\nalso require Pakistan and India to take all possible \r\nmeasures to avert further escalation. It was against that \r\nbackdrop that Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif announced \r\na four-point peace initiative in the General Assembly \r\non 30 September. That should have evoked a positive \r\nresponse from India, but so far that has not been \r\nforthcoming. Nevertheless, my country stands ready to \r\nengage in a dialogue on all outstanding issues.\r\nThe world certainly faces many complex and \r\ndaunting challenges, but today an interdependent and \r\ninterconnected world also possesses the capabilities \r\nand means to meet those challenges. We are confident \r\nthat through cooperative endeavours we can turn our \r\nshared aspirations for peace and progress for all our \r\npeoples into concrete actions and into reality.\r\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike at the outset to offer the congratulations of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on his \r\naccession to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nand to assure him of our full support as he conducts our \r\nwork in the year ahead.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/70/1), which outlines the very \r\nimportant and rapid changes that have occurred, from \r\nrising inequalities among peoples and violence against \r\n15-31290 7/16\r\n14/10/2015 A/70/PV.32\r\nwomen and girls to the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange, armed conflicts and terrorism.\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations, my delegation welcomes the fact that \r\nthe eradication of poverty has been identified as the \r\nmain objective of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and that the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development are reflected \r\nin a balanced way. My delegation also welcomes \r\nthe inclusion of economic objectives with respect \r\nto achieving sustainable and shared growth and the \r\npromotion of infrastructure and industrialization, \r\nwhich represent a significant step forward with respect \r\nto the Millennium Development Goals.\r\nSince we are living in a globalized world where \r\nactors are increasingly interdependent, global \r\npartnership for development and the means to attain the \r\nSustainable Development Goals are critical to ensuring \r\neconomic, social and political stability throughout the \r\nworld. It would also be wise for that global partnership \r\nto give greater consideration to Africa, which should \r\nremain the centre of concern. Our continent, which has \r\nindeed made remarkable progress towards stabilization, \r\nstill faces a combination of growing security threats. \r\nPeace and development there continue to face many \r\nproblems and challenges that urgently require a \r\ncollective national, regional and international response.\r\nTransnational organized crime, food insecurity, \r\nthe radicalization of young people, the outbreak of \r\npandemics and the exacerbation of terrorism and \r\nviolent extremism are mutually reinforcing scourges in \r\na context of fragile State institutions and unstructured \r\nsocieties. As stressed in the message that His Majesty \r\nthe King sent to the current session of the General \r\nAssembly,\r\n“Africa must be at the heart of international \r\ndevelopment cooperation in order to help the \r\ncontinent free itself from its colonial past and \r\nunlock its potential. Morocco therefore calls on \r\nthe United Nations and regional and international \r\nfinancial institutions to draft an action plan for \r\nthe economic transformation of Africa and the \r\nprovision of steady resources for its financing ... We \r\ncall for peace and stability to be made top priorities \r\nin order to prevent conflicts, tackle extremism \r\nand terrorism, and resolve the migration problem \r\nthrough an approach that takes into account the \r\ndignity of migrants, preserves their basic rights, \r\nand addresses the root causes of this phenomenon.” \r\n(A/70/PV.21, p. 11)\r\nRecognizing that no State alone can successfully \r\ncombat the threats to stability in Africa, the Kingdom of \r\nMorocco has consistently proclaimed loudly and clearly \r\nthat no one can defeat such threats without expanded \r\nregional cooperation and coordination, political will \r\nand more effective, concrete and active solidarity. . The \r\nUnited Nations system will always find in the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco a committed and tirelessly determined \r\npartner in supporting all constructive initiatives or \r\nactions on behalf of Africa.\r\nWith regard to question of peace and security, my \r\ndelegation fully shares the sincere concerns expressed \r\nby the Secretary-General in his report with regard to the \r\nthreats that continue to weigh on those matters due to \r\nthe new conflicts emerging every day and the new forms \r\nof violence aff licting several countries, particularly in \r\nAfrica and the Middle East. My delegation calls on the \r\ninternational community to invest more in efforts aimed \r\nat resolving disputes that poison the relations among \r\nneighbouring States and undermine their economic \r\nintegration, in particular on the African continent. \r\nSimilarly, the proliferation of terrorism is a great \r\nsource of concern for the international community and \r\nrequires shared efforts to thwart it.\r\nThus, in the context of its ongoing commitment \r\nto strengthening global action to fight terrorism, in \r\nparticular violent extremism, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\nhas consistently shared its know-how and experience \r\nacquired in that area by actively contributing to \r\nstrengthening bilateral, regional and international \r\ncooperation. At the meeting convened by the \r\nCounter-Terrorism Committee on 30 September 2014, \r\nMorocco’s experience in combating radicalism and \r\nviolent extremism was shared by high-level Moroccan \r\nofficials and friendly countries that had benefitted \r\nfrom Moroccan cooperation in that area. That meeting \r\nenabled us to highlight His Majesty the King’s decision \r\nto train imams and preachers from a number of African \r\ncountries in the Muslim religion’s precepts of tolerance, \r\nmoderation and respect for others.\r\nRegarding the fight against climate change, the \r\nKingdom of Morocco has been working to develop \r\na national policy on environmental issues. That has \r\nresulted in our adoption of a national environmental \r\ncharter, the launch of a green plan for Morocco and the \r\nstart of construction on an ambitious solar and wind-\r\n8/16 15-31290\r\nA/70/PV.32 14/10/2015\r\nturbine renewable energy programme designed to meet \r\n42 per cent of the country’s energy needs by 2020. I \r\nshould note here that in Marrakesh in 2016, Morocco \r\nwill host the twenty-second session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, which has always \r\nsubscribed to efforts based on dialogue and consultation, \r\nis making a substantial contribution to initiatives aimed \r\nat the peaceful settlement of conflicts. My delegation \r\ncalls for an end to the violence in Syria and Libya \r\nand hopes that a political transition in line with their \r\npeoples’ aspirations can ensure territorial integrity, \r\nnational unity and stability throughout the region. \r\nMorocco also calls for the mobilization of international \r\nsupport for a solution to the Palestinian question and \r\nthe establishment of an independent Palestinian State \r\nliving side by side in peace and security with Israel.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate that Morocco \r\nremains committed and ready to work with all Member \r\nStates in order to build a strong United Nations, capable \r\nof executing the difficult tasks it is burdened with and \r\nthe multiple challenges it has to face. We must all work \r\ntirelessly, collectively and in a coordinated fashion in \r\norder to make it an effective instrument for achieving \r\npeace and security and spreading the values of tolerance \r\nand coexistence in the service of all humankind.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his annual report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/70/1). We are fortunate that today’s \r\nmeeting is taking place shortly after the high-level \r\ngeneral debate, during which our leaders addressed \r\nthe General Assembly. We therefore have not only the \r\nreport’s perspective but also our leaders’ views to guide \r\nus in our meeting today.\r\nBefore going into some aspects of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report, it is worth noting that in paragraph \r\n4 it itemizes as many as 13 specific areas of conflict \r\nor crisis that currently scar the international landscape, \r\nalong with emerging new threats that terrorist \r\ngroups pose to international peace and security. The \r\ncumulative impact of those conflicts and crises is being \r\nfelt by almost 60 million people — innocent men, \r\nwomen and children. Yet section B of chapter II of the \r\nreport is strangely silent on why the Security Council, \r\nwhich is serviced by the Secretariat and has primary \r\nresponsibility under the Charter of the United Nations \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nhas allowed so many crises to mushroom.\r\nMy delegation has repeatedly stated at the highest \r\nlevel that the Security Council’s ineffectiveness is \r\ndue to its unrepresentative composition, particularly \r\nits permanent membership. We were all party to our \r\nleaders’ unanimous decision at the 2005 World Summit \r\nto work for speedy reform of the Council to make it fit \r\nfor purpose. Paragraph 102 of the report tries to reflect \r\nthe significant progress we made in the Assembly \r\non 14 September (see A/69/PV.104) but buries this in \r\nbusiness-as-usual statistics.\r\nThe context for our deep concern about the steady \r\nerosion of international peace and security is our leaders’ \r\nrecent adoption of the ambitious 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1). The report \r\ngives many details about the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and their integration \r\ninto the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), which \r\nare at the heart of the 2030 Agenda. We have expressed \r\nour support for the Secretary-General’s vision in those \r\nparts of the report, including in the area of climate \r\nchange. For many of the SDGs we have just adopted, \r\nIndia has announced national development initiatives \r\nwith specific time frames for implementation.\r\nWe would like our national effort, involving almost \r\none sixth of humankind, to help to accelerate and \r\nlead the way to achievement of the 2030 Agenda in a \r\nsubstantive manner. However, we are also cognizant \r\nof the importance of the ways in which a supportive \r\nand stable political environment is linked to and \r\nimpacts successful implementation of the Agenda. It \r\nis self evident that political instability is an obstacle \r\nto the f low of investments, technology and trade, and \r\nconsequently it severely restricts prospects for sustained \r\nsocioeconomic growth. In a globalized world, our \r\noverarching objective of eradicating poverty by 2030 \r\nwill be jeopardized unless we adopt a holistic approach.\r\nWe would like to touch on three issues covered \r\nin the report. The first is United Nations peace \r\noperations. The report provides a detailed account of \r\nthe Security Council’s efforts to draw up mandates for \r\nboth peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations. The \r\ntwo have been synergized in the public mind through \r\nthe Secretary-General’s appointment of the High-level \r\nIndependent Panel on Peace Operations. We endorsed \r\nthe Panel’s recommendations (see A/70/95) in the \r\nGeneral Assembly and look forward to contributing to \r\n15-31290 9/16\r\n14/10/2015 A/70/PV.32\r\ntheir implementation during this session, especially in \r\nthe Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. \r\nIn order to implement the Panel’s recommendations, \r\nIndia has committed significant additional resources, \r\nincluding an increase of 10 per cent to our existing \r\ncontribution of almost 8,000 troops and the provision of \r\nadditional female peacekeepers, highly skilled enablers \r\nand facilities for training peacekeepers from other \r\nMember States.\r\nThe second issue is terrorism, and it is one on \r\nwhich the United Nations has appeared ineffective, \r\nalthough both the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly have adopted resolutions, sanctions regimes \r\nand strategies to counter terrorism over the past \r\n15 years. As far as the Organization itself is concerned, \r\nwe note that as many as 31 entities within the United \r\nNations deal with some aspect of countering terrorism. \r\nAgreement on a coordinator for these entities’ work \r\nis a priority that we cannot postpone. Our public \r\nconsciousness is being ravaged daily by incessant \r\nacts of terrorism targeting innocent people, our \r\ncivilizations’ heritage and, increasingly, our societies’ \r\nsocioeconomic infrastructure, especially in vulnerable \r\ndeveloping countries. We look forward to the launch \r\nof the Secretary-General’s initiative on countering \r\nterrorism, mentioned in paragraph 96 of the report, \r\nduring this session of the Assembly. We hope it will \r\ninclude a road map to help us to adopt the long-pending \r\ncomprehensive convention on international terrorism, \r\nat the heart of which is the legal principle of “prosecute \r\nor extradite”.\r\nThe third issue that we would like to comment on \r\nis reflected in section C of the report, on Africa. India \r\nis organizing the third India-Africa Forum Summit, \r\nstarting on 26 October, with plans for all 54 African \r\ncountries to participate. It will be the single biggest \r\ndiplomatic event held in India since 1983. We aim \r\nto build on the bonds of our traditional political and \r\nsocioeconomic relations with Africa and take advantage \r\nof new technologies that can enable us to accelerate our \r\nefforts to achieve our shared development aspirations. \r\nThe success of the Pan-African E-network project, with \r\na focus on telemedicine and tele-education, is a good \r\nexample of how we can contribute, as a responsible \r\nMember State, to our Organization’s commitment to \r\nAfrica’s rapid development.\r\nIndia has steadily increased its active participation \r\nin issues on the Organization’s humanitarian agenda \r\nin order to become a reliable early responder to \r\nhumanitarian crises. During the past year, in response \r\nto the Secretary-General’s appeal, we were the biggest \r\nfinancial contributor among developing countries to \r\nthe Ebola trust fund. Similarly, at the international \r\ndonor conference in Kathmandu, we made significant \r\ncontributions to the early relief and rehabilitation of \r\nthe thousands of victims of the devastating earthquake \r\nin Nepal. We have contributed quickly to relief for \r\ndevastation caused by cyclones and storms in both the \r\nPacific and the Caribbean. Through our participation \r\nin South-South cooperation structures such as the \r\nIndia Brazil South Africa Fund, we have shared our \r\ndevelopment experience with our partners in the \r\ndeveloping world, without making the partnership \r\nconditional or prescriptive.\r\nIn conclusion, I find it most unfortunate that my \r\ncolleague from Pakistan has chosen to refer to issues \r\nthat are extraneous to the debate we are having here \r\ntoday. We have diplomatic relations with Pakistan, and \r\nsuch issues should be addressed within the framework \r\nof those relations, rather than being aired elsewhere.\r\nMr. Minami (Japan): At the outset, I would like \r\nto convey to the Secretary-General Japan’s deep \r\nappreciation for his efforts in guiding the activities of \r\nUnited Nations and for his latest report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/70/1).\r\nDuring the week of high-level debate, we celebrated \r\nthe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) as a historic document. \r\nThis year will also mark the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations, and we look forward to the related \r\nevent on 23 October. However, we face huge challenges, \r\nsuch as climate change, the refugee and migration \r\ncrisis, terrorism and protracted conflict situations \r\nthroughout the world. How to address those challenges \r\nin a collective manner is the fundamental question for \r\nmultilateralism.\r\nAs we all know, the United Nations has three \r\npillars: peace and security, development and human \r\nrights. But we believe that peace and security have the \r\nmost significant importance in the light of many crises \r\nin the world. United Nations peacekeeping operations \r\nare the most important tool that the United Nations has \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nWe should also recognize the challenge in front of us, \r\nwhich is how to make United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations more sustainable in both financial and \r\nhuman resources aspects. That requires us to take \r\n10/16 15-31290\r\nA/70/PV.32 14/10/2015\r\nconcrete and holistic actions in order to improve that \r\ntool. \r\nIn that regard, Japan will contribute further to \r\npeacekeeping operations by broadening its involvement \r\nbased on a proactive contribution to peace, through \r\nthe commitments announced by Prime Minister Abe \r\nat the second leaders summit on peacekeeping, held \r\nin September. Japan also continues to support the \r\nstrategic review process outlined in both the report of \r\nthe High-Level Independent Panel on Peacekeeping \r\nOperations (see A/70/95) and the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/70/357). Japan will proactively contribute to \r\npeacekeeping-related issues during this session through \r\nactive participation in the upcoming discussion in the \r\nSpecial Committee on Peacekeeping Operations and in \r\nthe Fifth Committee.\r\nWith respect to the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nJapan has been active in it since its establishment, in \r\n2005. This year, the Working Group on Lessons Learned \r\nheld a series of meetings on the challenges associated \r\nwith institution-building in post-conflict situations. We \r\nwill conclude that exercise with a report by the Chair, \r\nto be issued by the end of the year. We hope that that \r\nreport will benefit the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non the 2015 review of the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture, scheduled to commence this fall following \r\nthe issuance of the report of the Advisory Group of \r\nExperts (see A/69/968), by offering a useful perspective \r\non the role to be played by the PBC in the context of \r\ninstitution-building.\r\nAmong the organs of the United Nations, the \r\nSecurity Council should undoubtedly have the \r\nprimary responsibility for peace and security. The \r\nCouncil should reflect the realities of the international \r\ncommunity of the twenty-first century in order to \r\nmore effectively and promptly address ever-growing \r\nconflicts and crises. Allow me to draw the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the meeting on Security Council reform \r\nof the leaders of the group of four countries made up \r\nof Brazil, Germany, India and Japan that was held in \r\nNew York on 26 September. The group is determined to \r\nredouble its efforts towards securing concrete outcomes \r\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\r\nOur leaders have adopted the 2030 Agenda, and \r\nnow Member States need to start the implementation \r\nof that holistic and ambitious Agenda, in particular the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Japan is fully \r\ncommitted to the implementation of the Agenda, both \r\nat home and abroad, in order to ensure that no one is \r\nleft behind. All United Nations States Members have \r\na responsibility to ensure that the United Nations is \r\nfully equipped to succeed in achieving that ambitious \r\nAgenda. However, I must say that the process of \r\nits implementation will be a long and tough one. \r\nThe positive momentum created by the successful \r\nagreements this year — namely, in Sendai, Addis Ababa \r\nand at the recent summit here in New York — impels \r\nus to succeed at the twenty-first Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, to be held in Paris. We should not \r\nmiss that opportunity to establish a fair and effective \r\ninternational framework applicable to all parties.\r\nWhen we talk about the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda in the light of “no one left behind”, we \r\nmust not forget the development challenges faced by \r\nAfrican countries. The Tokyo International Conference \r\non African Development (TICAD) process has been up \r\nand running since 1993, in close cooperation among \r\nJapan, the Office of the Special Adviser on Africa, \r\nthe African Union Commission, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme and the World Bank. For \r\nover 20 years, Africa and Japan have shared both the \r\nconcept and practice of development rooted in the idea \r\nof ownership and partnership. To continue building on \r\nthat foundation, Japan will mobilize up to $32 billion \r\nbetween 2013 and 2017, in both the public and private \r\nsectors. Japan is determined to further enhance \r\nour efforts through the TICAD process to promote \r\ntransformative, resilient and inclusive growth across \r\nAfrica. We look forward to the forthcoming sixth \r\nTICAD Summit, to be held in Nairobi in 2016, which \r\nwill be the first ever to take place in Africa.\r\nSeventy years have passed since the atomic \r\nbombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. Although there \r\nare some developments that run counter to nuclear \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation, the international \r\ncommunity must continue to make steady progress in \r\norder to achieve a world free of nuclear weapons. In \r\nthat connection, Japan regrets that the final document \r\nof 2015 Review Conference of the Parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) \r\nwas not adopted. \r\nNotwithstanding that fact, Japan would like to \r\nstress that the NPT regime has played an extremely \r\nimportant role in maintaining peace and stability in \r\nthe international community, and that role remains \r\nunchanged even today. We must also not forget that \r\nthere were many useful discussions on the main \r\n15-31290 11/16\r\n14/10/2015 A/70/PV.32\r\nissues of the Review Conference, and Japan deems it \r\nimportant to further develop what was discussed during \r\nthe Conference. In that context, Japan will submit to the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventieth session a new draft \r\nresolution on the total elimination of nuclear weapons, \r\non the basis of the discussions held at the last Review \r\nConference.\r\nThe topic of human rights is one of the three pillars \r\nof the United Nations and is a matter of humanity and \r\ndignity. In the implementation of the SDGs, we believe \r\nthat the focus on human rights should be emphasized \r\nmore. Japan aims to create a society in which women \r\nshine, not only in Japan but also all over the world. \r\nJapan places particular emphasis on the women and \r\npeace and security agenda, pursuant to Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000). This year, Japan finalized its \r\nown action plan with regard to the participation and \r\nprotection of women, based on resolution 1325 (2000). \r\nJapan is determined to further promote that agenda in \r\ncollaboration with United Nations bodies.\r\nDespite the concerns reiterated by the international \r\ncommunity in various forums, the human rights \r\nsituation in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nremains unchanged. Grave human rights violations \r\ncontinue to be committed on a large scale. Therefore, \r\nJapan, together with the European Union, will once \r\nagain sponsor a draft resolution on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea at this session. We look forward to the continuous \r\nand active engagement of the Security Council on that \r\nissue.\r\nWith regard to administrative and budgetary \r\nissues, during the main session the Fifth Committee \r\nwill address both the scale of assessments and the \r\nbudget proposal for the 2016-2017 biennium. In order \r\nto ensure budgetary discipline and the United Nations \r\nability to deliver its mandate, Japan will carefully \r\nanalyse and judge the appropriateness and affordability \r\nof the proposed programme budget. Japan requests that \r\nthe Secretariat take a fresh look at the needs of the \r\nOrganization. Japan expresses its appreciation for the \r\nSecretary-General’s continuing and strong commitment \r\nto the better management of the Secretariat and United \r\nNations facilities.\r\nFinally, I would like to conclude my statement today \r\nby assuring the Assembly that Japan will continue to \r\nwork closely with the Secretary-General to ensure a \r\nmore effective and efficient United Nations. To that \r\nend, I would like to add that Japan is determined and \r\nready to serve as a new member of the Security Council \r\nbeginning in January 2016, if elected by the Member \r\nStates here in the Hall tomorrow.\r\nMr. Adamov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of Belarus read with interest the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/70/1). We share the report’s overall assessments \r\nof the international situation, which were highlighted \r\nby many speakers during the general debate at this \r\nseventieth session. \r\nBelarus notes with satisfaction the efforts of the \r\nOrganization on areas of priority for our country: \r\ndisarmament, including nuclear disarmament, and \r\ninternational security; the fight against human \r\ntrafficking; establishing an energy agenda for \r\nthe Organization; the problems of middle-income \r\ncountries; and advancing the interests of youth. We \r\nnote the positive changes in the working methods of \r\nthe Secretariat on such topics as the rule of law and the \r\nresponsibility to protect. We believe that it is necessary \r\nto continue work on those issues on the basis of open \r\nconsultations with Member States.\r\nIn spite of certain successes we have seen in the \r\nOrganization’s activities, we believe that it is necessary \r\nto pay attention to the need for further improvements \r\nin its work. Belarus continues to express its concern \r\nabout the format for the implementation of the Rights \r\nUp Front initiative. We oppose authorizing the \r\ninternational civil service to carry out human rights \r\nmonitoring functions on risk identification without the \r\nagreement of the States concerned, or placing excessive \r\nemphasis on the human rights aspect of United Nations \r\ncountry programmes.\r\nWe note with concern the Secreatariat’s unilateral \r\nand non-transparent promotion of confrontational \r\nideas on which Member States have not agreed and \r\nthat may even contradict their legislation and their \r\ncultural, religious and other foundations. Even if such \r\napproaches are set out in the internal documents of the \r\nSecretariat, they undermine trust in the Organization \r\nand are not coducive to unity among Member States. \r\nWe can find an example of that in the controversial \r\ndiscussion in March on the issue of defining the family \r\nstatus of Secretariat staff for the payment of benefits.\r\nThe issue of improving the situation with regard to \r\nensuring geographical balance in the Secretariat is still \r\nrelevant, first and foremost when it comes to appointing \r\nsenior officials. We must not forget that the goal is not \r\n12/16 15-31290\r\nA/70/PV.32 14/10/2015\r\nto entrench one’s representatives and hold on to posts, \r\nbut to ensure as broad a range of views and diversity of \r\napproaches and mindsets within the Secretariat.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the processes of \r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly and reforming the \r\nSecurity Council, Belarus must note the existence \r\nof systemic problems in the interaction between \r\npermanent representatives and the Secretariat. That has \r\nmade it necessary for the Non-Aligned Movement to \r\nadvance an initiative on holding an informal dialogue \r\non the issue under the aegis of the President of the \r\nAssembly at this session. We hope that the outcome of \r\nthe dialogue will be duly accepted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and his staff.\r\nWe also call for greater attention to issues \r\nconcerning the everyday operation of the Organization \r\nand further improving the forms and methods of the \r\nSecretariat’s work. Given the challenges and objectives \r\nfacing the Organization, that may seem insignificant, \r\nbut it is precisely such details that determine how the \r\ncontext and course of our work will affect the overall \r\nresults.\r\nMr. Reyes Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nsubmitting his report on the work of the Organization \r\n(A/70/1) and for his leadership as the helm of the \r\nOrganization. The consideration of this item coincides \r\nwith the commemoration of the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the founding of the United Nations, an ideal occasion \r\nto reflect on the achievements and challenges beyond \r\nthe past 12 months. \r\nWe agree with the Secretary-General that\r\n“through seven decades of profound turbulence \r\nand change, the vision articulated in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations has stood the test of time, \r\neven as the world has become transformed beyond \r\nanything our founders imagined” (A/70/1, para. 1).\r\nInternational peace and security are not \r\nfeasible without sustainable, equitable and inclusive \r\ndevelopment that benefits all individuals and all \r\npeoples. The purposes and principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nlaw have continued to serve as a fundamental guide \r\nfor international relations. However, they have been \r\nviolated by the conduct of certain States that resort to \r\nthe use and threat of force and serious actions against \r\nthe sovereignty of other nations, including through the \r\napplication of unilateral coercive measures.\r\nJust a few days ago, world leaders adopted a new \r\ndevelopment agenda with goals for the next 15 years. \r\nWe are beginning the most difficult phase — to make \r\na reality of the agreements embodied in that agenda. \r\nIt will not be easy. It will depend upon political will, \r\navailability  of and access to economic and financial \r\nresources, and international solidarity and cooperation, \r\nbearing very much in mind the asymmetries and \r\ndisparities in development among nations. Nor will it \r\nbe possible to fulfil the new sustainable development \r\nagendaby a[pplying coercive or unilateral measures or \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockades, nor by \r\nsubjugating entire peoples to colonialism or the rigours \r\nof foreign occupation.\r\nThe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, in Paris \r\nat the end of the year, will again test the capacity of \r\nhumankind to ensure its own survival and that of \r\nother species living on our planet. Our future depends \r\non making crucial changes to the current patterns of \r\nproduction and consumption, which reflect selfishness \r\nand the irrationality guiding neoliberal capitalism.\r\nThe terrible threat of destruction through the use \r\nof nuclear weapons continues to be an unresolved \r\nproblem. Its solution will also determine the survival of \r\nhuman beings. The only way to save humankind from \r\nthe terrible impact of nuclear weapons is their complete \r\nprohibition and total elimination. Cuba is firmly \r\ncommitted to the international efforts to achieve that \r\npriority objective. Sadly, the ninth Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons concluded without any concrete \r\nagreements, thus accentuating the shortcomings of the \r\ninternational legal regime to solve the challenge posed \r\nby nuclear weapons. New ideas and approaches are \r\nneeded, and we hope that Member States will succeed \r\nin speedily breaking the inertia in the disarmament \r\nmachinery of the United Nations.\r\nCuba rejects the existence of all kinds of weapons of \r\nmass destruction and firmly condemns the use of such \r\nweapons. Consolidating multilateralism  and, in that \r\ncontext, strengthening and implementing the provisions \r\nof the respective conventions against biological and \r\nchemical weapons are also priorities for Cuba.\r\nDuring the period covered by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report discussions continued on one of \r\nthe crucial components of the transformation of the \r\nOrganization: the reform of the Security Council. \r\nThe establishment of a genuinely fair, democratic and \r\n15-31290 13/16\r\n14/10/2015 A/70/PV.32\r\nequitable new international order remains an illusion. \r\nThe democratization of the Security Council based on \r\na radical reform remains a pending task. \r\nWe need a more democratic and effective United \r\nNations, one whose organs respect their separate \r\nmandates and with a revitalized, strengthened General \r\nAssembly at its centre that is fully able to exercise \r\nthe functions assigned it by the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe Security Council should fulfil its obligation to \r\npromote a negotiated settlement to the Israeli occupation \r\nof Palestinian territories, set a definitive datae for the \r\nend of that occupation and make a reality of the will \r\nof the international community with regard to the \r\npeaceful coexistence of two independent States. Cuba \r\nreaffirms its unwavering solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople and its firm, decisive support for all actions that \r\nwill lead to recognition of the State of Palestine on the \r\nbasis of the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, as well as to the right of the State of Palestine to \r\nbecome a full Member of the Organization.\r\nThe new information and communication \r\ntechnologies are tools created by human beings \r\nthat hold immense potential for their well-being \r\nand development, if they are used for peaceful ends \r\nand noble goals. Closer international cooperation is \r\nneeded to combat the harmful use of the Internet, in \r\nparticular cyberterrorism, cybercrime, xenophobia and \r\nracism, among other scourges. At the same time, it is \r\nessential to respect sovereignty in cyberspace and to \r\nreject hegemony in that regard. The militarization of \r\ncyberspace is unacceptable, as is the covert and illegal \r\nuse of information and communication technologies to \r\nattack other States.\r\nCuba immediately answered the call of the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations and the \r\nExecutive Director of the World Health Organization \r\nto address the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, \r\nconfirming the validity of the principles of solidarity \r\nand internationalism that the Cuban Revolution has \r\npractised since its own triumph. Cuba is honoured \r\nto belong to a region — Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean — that moves in the vanguard of promoting \r\npeace and the peaceful resolution of disputes, having \r\nbeen proclaimed by its leaders as a zone of peace \r\nduring the second Summit of the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, held in Havana.\r\nTo conclude, I support the words of President Raúl \r\nCastro Ruz, taken from his address to the Assembly at \r\nthe end of September:\r\n“Cuba is celebrating with profound commitment \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations. \r\nDespite the efforts that have been made throughout \r\nthose years, not enough has been done to save \r\npresent and future generations from the scourge \r\nof war and to protect their right to sustainable \r\ndevelopment without exclusions. The United \r\nNations should be defended from unilateralism and \r\nshould be deeply reformed to democratize it and \r\nbring it closer to the peoples.” (A/70/PV.14, p. 6)\r\nMr. Khoshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): Let me \r\nstart by thanking the Secretary-General for his report \r\non the work of the Organization (A/70/1).\r\nSeventy years after the establishment of the \r\nOrganization, the vision of its founders set out in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations is still the beacon for \r\nour collective efforts to achieve the goals of the United \r\nNations. In the course of those 70 years, so many things \r\nhave changed, but not the aspirations of “We the peoples \r\nof the United Nations”, who want to live together in \r\npeace and who have faith in fundamental human rights \r\nand the dignity and worth of every human being. Today \r\nmore than ever, we need to achieve the purposes of the \r\nOrganization and to respect and reaffirm its principles.\r\nThe world today is full of perils and hopes. The \r\nideals of the Charter have never been so within reach, \r\nyet at the same time the challenges to them have never \r\nbeen so grave. Through our collective endeavours, we \r\nhave achieved a lot, but much more remains to be done.\r\nThe past year provides a typical example of \r\nthe history of the Organization, a year of great \r\nachievements and big disappointments. On the one \r\nhand, the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) was finalized and the \r\nJoint Comprehensive Program of Action between Iran \r\nand the P5+1 was concluded. On the other hand, the \r\npeople of Palestine still live under occupation, while \r\nmany people in our region, from Syria to Yemen, are \r\nliving under miserable conditions, and the brutality of \r\nextremist groups like Daesh, the Al-Nusra Front and \r\nBoko Haram continue.\r\nLet me briefly reflect on some of the main areas of \r\nthe activity of the Organization.\r\n14/16 15-31290\r\nA/70/PV.32 14/10/2015\r\nIn the field of international peace and security, \r\nthe successful conclusion of negotiations between \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the P5+1 countries, \r\nwhich resulted in the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction, endorsed by the Security Council, proved that, \r\nwith seriousness, good faith and a win-win approach, \r\ndiplomacy can unlock even one of the most complex \r\nissues. We believe that the deal not only transforms the \r\ndynamics of interaction between my country and the \r\ninternational community, but that it also has important \r\npositive ramifications for the entire region and can \r\nhelp facilitate more cooperation in various fields, from \r\nsecurity to development to the environment. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran is consistent and \r\nsincere in its call to establish in our region a platform \r\nfor dialogue, which should be conducted on the basis \r\nof common goals and principles as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, namely, respect for \r\nthe sovereignty, territorial integrity and political \r\nindependence of all countries, non-intervention in \r\nthe domestic affairs of other countries, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, refraining from the threat of or \r\nthe use of force, the promotion of peace and stability, \r\nand the achievement of progress and prosperity for all.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran underlines the \r\nimperative of the total elimination of nuclear weapons \r\nas a requirement for international security and an \r\nobligation under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weaopns (NPT), which is long overdue. \r\nWe regret that as a result of the opposition of a small \r\nminority, the 2015 NPT Review Conference could not \r\nachieve its objectives.\r\nWe are grateful to Member States for their support, \r\nwhich enableed the Assembly to adopt by consensus \r\nresolution 68/127, entitled “A world against violence \r\nand violent extremism”. As the current situation and \r\nthe escalation of violent extremism and terrorism in our \r\nregion attest to the pertinence of that resolution and the \r\nidea behind it, we need to revisit that resolution during \r\nthis session. We earnestly await the draft comprehensive \r\nplan of action on combating violent extremism that the \r\nSecretary-General is to present to the Assembly in the \r\ncoming months.\r\nWe believe that the issue of development \r\nshould always enjoy priority on the agenda of the \r\nOrganization. Let me commend all those involved in \r\nthe process to finalize the outcome document entitled \r\n“Transforming our world: The 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development” (resolution 70/1), which our \r\nleaders adopted two weeks ago in this organ. As the \r\nAgenda has been adopted, our undertakings can begin. \r\nThe challenges ahead of us should be met collectively, \r\nin a resolute and coordinated manner. Implementing \r\nthe ambitious Sustainable Development Goals demands \r\nmore inclusive and non-discriminatory provisions, \r\nparticularly regarding the financing and transfer of \r\ntechnology and associated know-how for moving \r\ntowards a truly global partnership. The Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran is committed to engaging constructively in the \r\nimplementation of the Agenda at all levels, and in that \r\nregard we welcome cooperation with the public and \r\nprivate sectors.\r\nThe situation in our region shows how our \r\nchallenges in the globalized world are interconnected \r\nand mutually reinforcing. Our region is not only facing \r\ndire climate conditions due to climate change, but is \r\nalso grappling with the scourge of terrorism and violent \r\nextremism. While terrorists damage the environment, \r\nthey also force sustainable development objectives from \r\nthe agendas being pursued by countries, forcing them \r\nto spend their national resources on fighting insecurity. \r\nWe are extremely concerned about the situation in \r\nparts of the region, especially Syria, Yemen and Libya, \r\nwhich has inflicted untold misery upon the people and \r\nenabled the extremists to continue their savagery. The \r\nUnited Nations system should assume a more active \r\nrole and do everything in its power to find peaceful \r\nsolutions to those situations and to end those tragedies.\r\nBefore concluding, let me reiterate the relevance \r\nof the principles on which the Organization was \r\nfounded. The sovereign equality of all Member States, \r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes \r\nand refraining from the threat or use of force in \r\ninternational relations are cornerstones upon which the \r\nOrganization was built and continues to function. The \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, reiterating its unwavering \r\nsupport for the work of the United Nations based on its \r\nCharter, is ready to engage with all Member States to \r\nfurther the United Nations goals and collectively tackle \r\nthe challenges facing humankind as a whole.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker on the debate on this item.\r\nSeveral representatives have asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. May I remind members \r\nthat statements in exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\n5 minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\n15-31290 15/16\r\n14/10/2015 A/70/PV.32\r\nMr. Singh (India): I take the f loor in exercise of \r\nour right of reply in respose to a reference made by the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan to the Indian state of Jammu \r\nand Kashmir, which is, has always been and will remain \r\nan integral part of India. It is all the more ironical \r\nthat those comments should come from a country that \r\ncontinues to illegally occupy part of the Indian state \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir. Those references are entirely \r\nout of context and constitute a clear interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of India. Therefore, we reject them in \r\ntheir entirety.\r\nIt is also a matter of deep regret that Pakistan has \r\nviolated the ceasefire on a number of occasions in the \r\npast several weeks, leading to the loss of civilian lives \r\non the Indian side. Indian armed forces and paramilitary \r\nforces have responded to those provocations. We would \r\nlike to remind the delegation of Pakistan of what the \r\nhonourable Minister for External Affairs of India \r\nsaid during her address to the General Assembly on \r\n1 October.\r\n“None of us can accept that terrorism is a legitimate \r\ninstrument of statecraft. The world shared our \r\noutrage at the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in \r\nwhich citizens of many nations were helplessly \r\nbutchered. That the mastermind behind the attack is \r\nwalking free is an affront to the entire international \r\ncommunity. Not only have past assurances in this \r\nregard not been honoured, but new cross-border \r\nterrorist attacks have taken place recently, and \r\ntwo terrorists from across the border have been \r\ncaptured alive. We all know that these attacks are \r\nmeant to destabilize India and legitimize Pakistan’s \r\nillegal occupation of parts of the Indian state of \r\nJammu and Kashmir and its claim to the rest of it.” \r\n(A/70/PV.22, p. 44).\r\nThe honourable Minister for External Affairs of \r\nIndia then added,\r\n“Let me use this occasion to spell out our \r\napproach clearly. India remains open to dialogue \r\nbut finds talks and terrorism to be incompatible ... \r\nWe do not need four points. We need just one — give \r\nup terrorism and let us sit down and talk ... That \r\nwas precisely what was discussed and decided by \r\nthe two Prime Ministers in Ufa this July. Let us \r\nhold talks, at the level of national security advisers, \r\non all issues connected to terrorism and arrange an \r\nearly meeting of our Directors-General of Military \r\nOperations to address the situation on the border. \r\nIf the response is serious and credible, India is \r\nprepared to address all outstanding issues through \r\nbilateral dialogue.” (ibid.)\r\nMr. An Myong Hun (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): I would like to respond to the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Japan. I will try to be \r\nbrief because we have raised the issue of Japan on other \r\noccasions throughout this session.\r\nThis year, we celebrate 70 years since the founding \r\nof the United Nations. This is a moment to reflect \r\non the peace and security issues facing the world. \r\nThe United Nations was created to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, but that scourge \r\nof war still lingers after 70 years and has not been \r\ncompletely eliminated. The sufferings and miseries \r\nof all sorts inflicted upon the Korean nation and other \r\nAsian peoples by Japanese militarism, with its illegal \r\nand military occupations, remain vivid in the people’s \r\nmemories. During the occupation of Korea alone, Japan \r\ncommitted such crimes against humanity as forcing \r\ntens of thousands of Korean women into what is called \r\nmilitary sexual slavery, exploiting them by inflicting \r\nall kinds of inhuman pain and humiliation.\r\nAs demonstrated by the statement made by the \r\nJapanese Prime Minister in August, on the occasion of \r\nthe defeat of Japanese militarism, Japan still denies its \r\npast crimes of aggression, even after 70 years. This is \r\na very important moment to reflect upon that case. The \r\ndenial by any country of its past crimes means that it \r\nwill repeat the same crimes. \r\nCurrently, we are seeing an open attempt to revive \r\nmilitarism in the recent moves of the Japanese political \r\nauthorities. Those are very dangerous moves that should \r\nconcern the international community. On this occasion, \r\nmy delegation once again strongly urges Japan this \r\nyear, which marks the seventieth year of the victory of \r\nthe Second World War, to thoroughly repudiate its past \r\ncrimes inflicted upon humanity.\r\nMs. Sayed (Pakistan): I am taking the f loor to \r\nexercise my right of reply with regard to the remarks \r\njust made by the representative of India. The Indian \r\nrepresentative has talked about the importance of \r\ndialogue. I want to remind him that it was not Pakistan \r\nthat stopped the dialogue process; it was India that \r\ncancelled the Foreign Secretary-level talks with \r\nPakistan scheduled for August 2014.\r\nWith regard to Kashmir, no matter what the Indian \r\nrepresentative says, the issue of Jammu and Kashmir \r\n16/16 15-31290\r\nA/70/PV.32 14/10/2015\r\nhas to be resolved in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolutions. \r\nWith regard to terrorism, let me point out that \r\nPakistan itself is the biggest victim of terrorism planted \r\non its soil, some of it emanating from our immediate \r\nneighbourhood. Terrorism is a common threat, and we \r\nmust all work together to eliminate it.\r\nIndia’s insistence on limiting the talks to a \r\none-point agenda proves that it is neither interested in \r\nnor serious about engaging in a genuine dialogue. Using \r\nthe issue of terrorism, India has not only managed to \r\nstall the bilateral dialogue but also vitiated the overall \r\natmosphere between the two countries. Pakistan’s \r\ncommitment and its role and sacrifice in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism, including the success of our ongoing \r\ncounter-terrorism operations, have been acknowledged \r\nand praised by the entire international community.\r\nIndia has also failed to bring to justice the \r\nperpetrators of terrorism against innocent civilians in \r\nthe Samjhauta Express bombing. That raises serious \r\ndoubts about India’s willingness to convict its nationals \r\ninvolved in terror incidents against Muslims.\r\nMr. Minami (Japan): My delegation would like to \r\nexercise its right of reply in response to the statement \r\nmade by the representative of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. I attentively listened to that \r\nstatement.\r\nThroughout the 70 years since the end of the Second \r\nWorld War, the Japanese people have established a free \r\nand democratic nation that respects human rights and \r\nthe rule of law. As a peace-loving nation, Japan has \r\ncontributed to the peace and prosperity of the Asia-\r\nPacific region. Japan will continue to walk the path \r\nof a peace-loving nation and to further contribute to \r\nthe peace and prosperity of the world. Such a position, \r\nas articulated by previous Cabinets, will remain \r\nunshakeable.\r\nThis year, in a Cabinet decision, Prime Minister \r\nShinzo Abe made a statement on 14 August on the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the end of the war. In his \r\nstatement, the Prime Minister articulated that Japan \r\nhas repeatedly expressed its feelings of deep remorse \r\nand heartfelt apologies for its actions during the \r\nSecond World War. He clearly stated that the positions \r\narticulated by previous Cabinet decisions will remain \r\nunshakeable. In the same statement, the Prime Minister \r\nalso stated that we must never forget that there were \r\nwomen behind the battlefields whose honour and \r\ndignity were severely injured during the wars in the \r\ntwentieth century, and we have engraved that past into \r\nour hearts.\r\nMr. An Myong Hun (Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea): I listened very carefully to what \r\nthe representative of Japan said. History itself cannot \r\nbe denied and cannot be erased. All of what he said \r\njust now serves as camouflage and a cover-up designed \r\nin an attempt to hide the heinous crimes that were \r\ncommitted against humanity. That crimes were \r\ncommitted against humanity during the Second World \r\nWar is an historical fact that has not yet been clearly or \r\ncompletely eliminated. That is why the Korean nations \r\nand other Asian nations still talk about them. We urge \r\nthe Japanese authorities to strongly heed what the \r\ninternational community has called for.\r\nMr. Minami (Japan): I again attentively listened to \r\nthe statement by the representative of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. I refrain from entering into \r\na detailed rebuttal to that statement, but I just want to \r\nstress that the human rights situation in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is a matter of grave concern \r\nto the international community. That is why many \r\nresolutions on that issue have been adopted by the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Human Rights Council. \r\nThe meeting at which the Security Council took up the \r\nsame issue last December is still fresh in our minds. \r\nAccordingly, I would like to stress again that the matter \r\nof human rights in the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea is an ongoing matter and not a historical one.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on the work of the Organization \r\ncontained in document A/70/1?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded this stage of its consideration of item 109.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.50 a.m.\r\n"
