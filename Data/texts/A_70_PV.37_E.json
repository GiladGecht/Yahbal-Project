The \r\nnames of these 36 States should therefore not appear on \r\nthe ballots.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2847 \r\n(XXVI), of 20 December 1971, and taking into account \r\nthe number of States that will remain members of the \r\nCouncil after 1 January 2016, the 18 members should be \r\nelected as follows: five from African States, four from \r\nAsia-Pacific States, two from Eastern European States, \r\nthree from Latin American and Caribbean States and \r\nfour from Western European and other States. The \r\nballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that those \r\ncandidates — their number not exceeding the number \r\nof seats to be filled — that receive a two-thirds majority \r\nand the greatest number of votes by members present \r\nand voting, will be declared elected. Consistent with \r\npast practice, in the case of a tie vote making it necessary \r\nto determine the candidate to be elected or that will \r\nproceed to the next round of restricted balloting, there \r\nwill be a special restricted ballot limited to those \r\ncandidates that have obtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election shall be held by secret \r\nballot, and there shall be no nominations.\r\nRegarding candidatures of the respective regional \r\nGroups, the Secretariat has been informed that for the \r\nfive vacant seats from among the African States, the \r\nGroup has endorsed five candidates: Algeria, Nigeria, \r\nRwanda, Somalia and South Africa. For the four vacant \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.37\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n37th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 21 October 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

For the two vacant seats from among \r\nthe Eastern European States, the Group has endorsed \r\ntwo candidates: the Czech Republic and the Republic \r\nof Moldova. For the three vacant seats from among the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, the Group has \r\nendorsed three candidates: Chile, Guyana and Peru. \r\nFor the four vacant seats from among the Western \r\nEuropean and other States, the Group has endorsed four \r\ncandidates: Australia, Belgium, Italy and the United \r\nStates of America.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of procedure, \r\nwe shall now proceed to the election by secret ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s name plate.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the \r\nelection. Please be reminded that during the voting \r\nprocess, all campaigning should cease in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. This means in particular that once the \r\nmeeting has begun, no more campaign material can \r\nbe distributed inside the Hall. All delegations are also \r\nrequested to remain at their seats so that the voting \r\nprocess can proceed in an orderly manner. I thank the \r\ndelegations for their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now \r\nbe distributed. I request representatives to use only \r\nthose ballot papers and to write on them the names of \r\nthe States for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be \r\ndeclared invalid if it contains more names of Member \r\nStates from the relevant region than the number of seats \r\nassigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if \r\nnone of the names of the Member States on that ballot \r\nbelongs to the relevant region. If a ballot paper of a \r\nregion contains both the names of Member States that \r\nbelong to and that are outside that region, the ballot \r\nremains valid but only the names of the Member States \r\nthat belong to the relevant region will be counted. The \r\nnames of Member States that do not belong to that \r\nregion will not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mrs. Vassil (El \r\nSalvador), Ms. Jeske (Germany), Mrs. Bowoleksono \r\n(Indonesia), Mr. Miró Weeden (Panama), \r\nMs. Magnon (Togo) and Mr. Varganov (Russian \r\nFederation) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.25 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.40 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  188\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  188\r\nAbstentions:  0\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  188\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  126\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nAlgeria  185\r\nNigeria  184\r\nSomalia  183\r\nRwanda  181\r\nSouth Africa  180\r\nBurundi  1\r\nCôte d’Ivoire  1\r\nEthiopia  1\r\nGroup B — Asia-Pacific States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  188\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  188\r\nAbstentions:  1\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  187\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  125\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nLebanon  182\r\nViet Nam  182\r\nAfghanistan  179\r\nIraq  179\r\nMongolia  1\r\nPhilippines  1\r\nSaudi Arabia  1\r\nUnited Arab Emirates  1\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  188\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  188\r\nAbstentions:  4\r\n15-32625 3/3\r\n21/10/2015 A/70/PV.37\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  184\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  123\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nCzech Republic  179\r\nRepublic of Moldova  179\r\nSlovenia  1\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  188\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  188\r\nAbstentions:  2\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  186\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  124\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nGuyana  182\r\nChile  180\r\nPeru  180\r\nBahamas  1\r\nEcuador  1\r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)  1\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  188\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  188\r\nAbstentions:  6\r\nNumber of members present and voting:  182\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  122\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nItaly  178\r\nAustralia  172\r\nBelgium  170\r\nUnited States  169\r\nIreland  1\r\nSan Marino  1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nAfghanistan, Algeria, Australia, Belgium, Chile, \r\nthe Czech Republic, Guyana, Iraq, Italy, Lebanon, \r\nNigeria, Peru, the Republic of Moldova, Rwanda, \r\nSomalia, South Africa, the United States of \r\nAmerica and Viet Nam were elected members of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for a three-year term \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2016.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the States that have \r\nbeen elected members of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in \r\nthis election.\r\nThis concludes this stage of our consideration of \r\nsub-item (b) of agenda item 112.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.50 a.m.\r\n"
