The African \r\nGroup is particularly inspired by his years of service, \r\nas reflected in his trail of public service, both national \r\nand international, here at the United Nations and in his \r\ncountry of origin. We note his service as the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of his country to the United Nations, \r\nas Chair of the Special Political and Decolonization \r\nCommittee (Fourth Committee) and as Vice-President \r\nof the General Assembly at its thirty-seventh session. \r\nHis work here at the United Nations culminated in his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-fourth session, in 2009.\r\nOn my personal behalf and on behalf of the African \r\nGroup, I wish to extend our deepest condolences to the \r\npeople of Libya and to the family of the late Mr. Ali \r\nTreki for their great loss, and we encourage them as \r\na group to find solace in his legacy of national and \r\ninternational service.\r\nSome of us here at the United Nations recall his \r\npowerful acceptance speech (see A/64/PV.1) on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session. In that speech he pointed \r\nout quite clearly that, while the Second World War had \r\ngiven victory to certain States and while the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations had allowed those victorious States \r\ncertain rights not accorded to the general membership, \r\nthe world had changed since then. It was therefore \r\nno longer possible for the United Nations, with a \r\nmembership of more than 190 countries, to remain the \r\nOrganization it had been when it had only 50 Members. \r\nThose are words to bear in mind as we address the \r\nquestions of the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nand the reform of the Security Council. He has left us \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.39\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n39th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 26 October 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\na legacy to build upon as we continue to advocate for a \r\nreformed United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Cambodia, who will speak on behalf \r\nof the Group of Asia-Pacific States.\r\nMr. Tuy (Cambodia): At the outset, I would like, \r\nas Chair of the Group of Asia-Pacific States, to extend \r\nour deepest condolences to the bereaved family of the \r\nlate Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, former President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.\r\nAmbassador Treki was a man of deep knowledge \r\nand a veteran in the field of diplomacy and international \r\nrelations. He was Libya’s Foreign Minister from 1977 \r\nto 1980 and served several times as his country’s \r\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations. In \r\n1982, he served as one of the Vice-Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its thirty-seventh session and later \r\npresided over the Fourth Committee. During his tenure \r\nas Libya’s Secretary of African Union Affairs, he played \r\na significant role in the creation of the African Union.\r\nAmbassador Treki’s candidacy to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session \r\nwas supported by 53 African nations. When he \r\nassumed office, on 15 September 2009, it was a very \r\nbusy year. It was a time when the world was facing \r\na number of challenges ranging from economic \r\nand food security crises, political instability, issues \r\nconcerning the protection of human rights, as well as \r\nthose related to the Millennium Development Goals \r\nand global health. It was during his presidency that the \r\nAssembly consolidated the four bodies working for the \r\nadvancement of women into a single new entity, which \r\nis UN-Women today.\r\nLet us remember Ambassador Treki’s first speech \r\n(see A/64/PV.1) upon assuming the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly. President Treki referred to \r\nhis determination to put an end to wars and to their \r\ncauses and consequences. He stated that dialogue and \r\nmutual understanding paved the way towards resolving \r\nour problems, and that embargoes and blockades \r\nwere fruitless. He also said that embargoes and \r\nblockades exacerbated antagonism and rebellion, while \r\nundermining respect for the international community. \r\nWe believe that the Ambassador’s words still resonate \r\ntoday, as dialogue and mutual understanding are indeed \r\nsome of the best ways to resolve the conflicts of the \r\nworld.\r\nAmbassador Treki’s passing away is felt not only \r\nby the African States, but by many Member States of \r\nthe United Nations. As such, I would like to conclude \r\nmy brief statement by once again conveying the deepest \r\ncondolences of the Asia-Pacific States. Our prayers go \r\nto the bereaved family members of the late Ali Treki. \r\nMay his soul rest in peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Slovakia, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Galbavý (Slovakia): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Group of Eastern European States.\r\nIt was with a great sense of loss that we received \r\nthe news of the passing away of His Excellency \r\nMr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session. On behalf of the \r\nEastern European States, I would like to express to the \r\nGovernment and the people of Libya, as well as to the \r\nfamily of Mr. Treki, our deepest sympathy and most \r\nsincere condolences.\r\nPresident Treki was an experienced diplomat well \r\nacquainted with United Nations issues, having served \r\nthree times as his country’s Permanent Representative \r\nto the world Organization. President Treki played a \r\nsignificant role in the creation of the African Union \r\nand contributed significantly to international efforts \r\nto promote peace and stability, mediating several \r\nconflicts in Africa, Cyprus and the Philippines, as well \r\nas in other parts of the world, including in countries \r\nmembers of our regional group.\r\nPresident Treki was his country’s Secretary for \r\nAfrican Union Affairs when he became the sixty-\r\nfourth President of the General Assembly, in 2009. As \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, he is remembered \r\nfor cultivating a spirit of cooperation, consensus-\r\nbuilding, enlightened leadership and dedicated service \r\nto our Organization. May God rest his soul.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nthe representative of Saint Kitts and Nevis, who will \r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States.\r\nMr. Condor (Saint Kitts and Nevis): On behalf of \r\nthe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States, I \r\nexpress our condolences on the passing away of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Abdussalam Treki, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its sixty-fourth session.\r\n15-33386 3/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\nPresident Treki had an extensive background in \r\ndiplomacy and multilateralism, including his long \r\ncareer in the service of his country. He served as Libya’s \r\nSecretary for African Union Affairs, Ambassador to \r\nFrance, Permanent Representative to the League of \r\nArab States in Cairo and Minister for Foreign Affairs.\r\nPresident Treki also served as his country’s \r\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations three \r\ntimes. He presided over the General Assembly’s Fourth \r\nCommittee and represented Libya on the Commission \r\non Human Rights. Notably, Mr. Treki was elected \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession, from 2009 to 2010, the culmination of a career \r\ndedicated to international relations. During his time as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Treki reiterated \r\nthe call for the Assembly to focus on three essential \r\nelements for its success, namely, support, coordination \r\nand innovation. Those are elements that we can all \r\ncontinue to champion as we move forward in attempting \r\nto strengthen the role of the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Treki will also be remembered for his \r\ndedication to the African Union, the League of Arab \r\nStates and the Non-Aligned Movement. His education \r\nin history and political history prepared him well for his \r\nservice to the international community and the United \r\nNations family. We extend our sincerest sympathy to \r\nhis family, friends and colleagues. The United Nations \r\ncommunity mourns his passing.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Ireland, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Western European and Other States.\r\nMr. Mawe (Ireland): On behalf of the Group \r\nof Western European and Other States, I extend to \r\nthe people and the Government of Libya our deepest \r\ncondolences on the death of His Excellency Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki, former President of the General \r\nAssembly at its sixty-fourth session.\r\nPresident Treki is remembered for his tireless \r\nwork in advancing the ideas of the United Nations as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession. A distinguished Libyan diplomat, he served as \r\nthe Minister for Foreign Affairs of Libya several times \r\nand as the Permanent Representative of Libya to the \r\nUnited Nations no fewer than three times. In 2009, after \r\na distinguished career in the Libyan Foreign Service, \r\nMr. Treki served as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-fourth session, and throughout his career \r\nhe consistently sought to promote Libyan cooperation \r\nwith the international community. The members of \r\nthe Group of Western European and Other States \r\nexpress their gratitude for what President Treki gave \r\nto the United Nations and offer our sympathies and \r\ncondolences to his family. Our thoughts and prayers are \r\nwith them during this difficult time.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United States of America, who \r\nwill speak on behalf of the host country.\r\nMs. Coleman (United States of America): I have \r\nthe sad task today to speak on behalf of the host \r\ncountry, the United States, on the loss of our colleague \r\nand former President of the General Assembly, Mr. Ali \r\nAbdussalam Treki. We wish to convey our sincere \r\ncondolences to his family, extended family and friends \r\nand all the people of Libya, whom he served. As we all \r\nknow, Ambassador Treki was a distinguished diplomat \r\nand an esteemed member of our community at the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nHis many posts, including representing Libya at the \r\nUnited Nations, serving as Libya’s Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, its Ambassador to France and, most recently, \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its sixty-fourth \r\nsession, speak to his distinguished career in the service \r\nof his nation, his continent and the broader global \r\ncommunity. Among his diplomatic achievements, \r\nAmbassador Treki also played a significant role in the \r\ncreation of the African Union and in mediating several \r\nconflicts across Africa and in other regions of the \r\nworld.\r\nI would like to reiterate, on behalf of the United \r\nStates, our deep regret for the loss of a husband and a \r\nfather, as well as a colleague and a friend.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Libya.\r\nMr. Dabbashi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, allow me to thank you, Sir, and the representatives \r\nof the regional groups and the representative of the host \r\ncountry for the heartfelt condolences expressed today \r\nand extended to the bereaved family members and \r\nfriends of our countryman, the late Mr. Ali Abdussalam \r\nTreki. We would also like to thank all those who have \r\nextended their condolences to the Libyan Permanent \r\nMission to the United Nations, whether through letters \r\nor phone calls. Naturally, we would also like to thank \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, and we would like \r\n4/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\nto inform the Assembly that all condolences will be \r\nforwarded to the bereaved family of the deceased.\r\nAllow me to personally extend my sympathy to \r\nthe wife of Mr. Treki, to his children, his family and \r\nindeed all of his friends. We are greatly saddened by his \r\nabsence, and we pray to God that He accepts him and \r\nthat He bestows mercy upon him.\r\nMr. Treki enjoyed a long career, which spanned \r\nmore than 40 years. He held a number of positions \r\nand posts, including serving at the head of Libya’s \r\ndiplomatic service, namely, as Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs. He also represented the African Union and \r\nwas secretary of the League of Arab States. He served \r\nthree times as the Permanent Representative of Libya \r\nto the United Nations in New York, and he was also the \r\nAmbassador of Libya to France and Libya’s permanent \r\nrepresentative to the League of Arab States in Cairo.\r\nIn addition, Mr. Treki chaired the Fourth \r\nCommittee of the General Assembly in 1983, at a time \r\nwhen a number of States were still under the yoke \r\nof apartheid and colonialism. He was also one of the \r\nVice-Presidents of the General Assembly at its thirty-\r\nseventh session, in 1982, and was elected President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-fourth session, for the \r\nperiod 2009-2010. Mr. Treki always strove to strengthen \r\nand bolster joint Arab and African diplomacy. He \r\nalways served international peace and security. He \r\nplayed a major role in creating the African Union and \r\ncontributed directly to mediation efforts in a number of \r\nconflicts, both within States and between States, such \r\nas conflicts in Africa, in the Sudan, in Chad, between \r\nEthiopia and Eritrea, between Djibouti and Eritrea, as \r\nwell as in other regions of the world, such as Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Cyprus, the Philippines and that between \r\nIraq and Iran.\r\nMr. Ali Treki, as head of Libyan diplomacy, \r\nworked in very difficult conditions, but always in a \r\nhighly professional manner, displaying exemplary \r\npatience, because he had to deal with the whims and \r\nchanging moods of the dictator at the head of Libya and \r\nwas also forced to manage the situation, the reality of \r\ninternational relations and, at the same time, protect \r\nLibya’s interests. He was able to ensure that Libyan \r\ndiplomacy and good standing were preserved. Of \r\ncourse, he always worked to further Libya’s interests. \r\nLibya today pays tribute to one of the greatest symbols \r\nof its diplomacy.\r\nAll those who knew Mr. Ali Treki will remember \r\nhim as an outstanding statesman, a patriot, one who \r\nwas very jealous of the prerogatives of his country, who \r\nalways fought for the rights of his country and Africa, \r\na man of peace who worked for peace, security and  the \r\nwell-being of humankind as a whole.\r\nAgenda item 12\r\nSport for development and peace: building a \r\npeaceful and better world through sport and the \r\nOlympic ideal\r\nDraft resolution (A/70/L.3)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Brazil to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/70.L.3.\r\nMr. Nuzman (Brazil): It is a privilege as an \r\nOlympian and President of the Organizing Committee \r\nfor the Rio 2016 Olympic Paralympic Games to address \r\nthe General Assembly and introduce draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.3, entitled “Building a peaceful and better \r\nworld through sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nI come to this house of dialogue to talk about truce, \r\nthe Olympic Truce. That is the greatest honour of all \r\nin this temple of consensus, where the Olympic f lag \r\nis raised with the goal of embracing diversity. Our \r\nmission is to organize the Olympic Games, and through \r\nthat effort to create a better world for the coming \r\ngenerations, to help them to see life through sport and \r\nto see sport as a way for all of us to build a fairer society \r\nin a healthier planet.\r\nSport brings a brighter future to athletes and to \r\nthe wider athletic family, which includes doctors, \r\ncoaches, sponsors, teachers, journalists and supporters. \r\nSix years ago, in Copenhagen, I asked my friends and \r\ncolleagues at the International Olympic Committee \r\n(IOC) meeting to vote for Rio de Janeiro. It opened \r\na gateway to 180 million passionate young people in \r\nSouth America, embracing a continent of 400 million \r\npeople, and offered exciting new opportunities for the \r\nOlympic movement.\r\nSouth America is a new region for the Olympic \r\nmovement: we will host the games for the first time. \r\nThat is an inspiration. Doors have been opened to other \r\nregions of the world. Sport could boost solidarity and \r\nimprove education, social inclusion, understanding, \r\npeace and hope for generations to come. We are looking \r\nfor a new set of opportunities that will allow the young \r\n15-33386 5/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\nto build the future they deserve. The International \r\nOlympic Committee supported our dream. The frontiers \r\nof the Olympic movement have expanded. When we \r\nthink about the true meaning of the IOC agenda and \r\nwe see Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and our IOC \r\nPresident Thomas Bach working together, we realize \r\nthat our future is in very good hands. Rio de Janeiro is \r\nready to deliver history. The city is being transformed. \r\nThe legacy of the 2016 Games will be tangible and \r\nperennial. We are talking about sport as a part of the \r\ncity’s education programme — a new urban mobility \r\nsystem, multiple job opportunities and a sustainable \r\ndrive for the future.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe Olympic spirit has had a unique power. It has \r\ntransformed cities, regions, countries and the lives \r\nof millions of people. It has changed the course of \r\nhistory. We dream of achieving the overarching goal. \r\nWe dream of humankind advancing towards a fairer, \r\nmore peaceful world with many more opportunities for \r\nyoung people. The Olympic Truce should not be only \r\na dream. We are here today to promote transformation \r\nthrough sport. We ardently desire peace.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nPeace is the only fair future for humankind, \r\nso our aim is to create a lasting legacy of peace for \r\nyoung people — a message of hope for the future, by \r\nreinforcing the rights of the world’s boys and girls. \r\nThat message includes the right to education, access \r\nto sport, access to health care, and protection from \r\nabuse and neglect. I have pointed out that this will be \r\nkey at the Rio 2016 Games, as 50,000 volunteers and \r\n11 million young students, who could potentially be \r\ninvolved in our education programme, will be lending \r\ntheir assistance. Those boys and girls are also part of \r\nthe school games organized by the Brazilian Olympic \r\nCommittee every year, with sport as a framework \r\nfor a better life. We have 284 days until the Olympic \r\ntorch arrives at the Maracana stadium for the opening \r\nceremony of the XXXI Olympiad. Today is the perfect \r\nday for all of us to make an even greater contribution to \r\na brighter future for generations to come.\r\nOn behalf of Brazil, the city of Rio de Janeiro and the \r\nOrganizing Committee, with its partners and the strong \r\nsupport of the federal, state and city Governments, \r\nI would like to thank the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session and ask for its support for the draft \r\nresolution.\r\nMr. Purevsuren (Mongolia): It gives me distinct \r\npleasure to address the General Assembly today on the \r\nrole of sport and the Olympic ideal in promoting peace \r\nand development.\r\nBy its very nature, sport is about participation. \r\nSport is about inclusion and equality. It stands for human \r\nvalues such as respect for the opponent, acceptance of \r\nbinding rules, teamwork and fairness — principles that \r\nare also embedded in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nSport has the potential to help overcome conflicts, both \r\nwithin and between States. It promotes rapprochement, \r\nbridges social, economic and cultural divides, and \r\nbuilds a sense of shared identity. Hence it is important \r\nto use sport as a tool to promote peace, dialogue and \r\nreconciliation in areas of conflict and disturbance, \r\nboth during and beyond the period of international \r\nsporting events. To that end, today we will vote for \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.3, sponsored by Brazil as host \r\nof the XXXI Olympic Games and of the XV Paralympic \r\nGames, to be held next year.\r\nWe commend the work done by the United Nations \r\nOffice on Sport for Development and Peace and other \r\nrelevant agencies in implementing the Olympic Truce \r\nand the Action Plan on Sport. World leaders have \r\nrecognized sport as an important enabler of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, as envisaged in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1), adopted at \r\nthe historic Summit last month.\r\nMongolia welcomes the decision of the General \r\nAssembly to designate 6 April as the International \r\nDay of Sport for Development and Peace. Sport is \r\ndeeply rooted in the traditional way of life of Mongols. \r\nWrestling, horse racing and archery are the three \r\nage-old competitions traditionally used to measure \r\nthe courage and strength of nomads. The development \r\nof sport has therefore been high on the agenda of the \r\nGovernment of Mongolia.\r\nSince 2011, we have been implementing a \r\ncomprehensive national programme to promote sports. \r\nThe programme seeks to promote public sports and \r\neducation aimed at instilling a healthy lifestyle and \r\nincreasing the longevity of the population, supporting \r\nsportsmen and athletes, building sport and fitness \r\ncentres for the general public, especially youth, \r\nchildren and people with disabilities, and encouraging \r\npublic-private partnerships in sport development. It \r\nalso envisages, inter alia, strengthening the national \r\ncapacity in sport and the skills of athletes, so that \r\n6/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\nthey can perform at a high level in world tournaments. \r\nWe also wish to expand the types of sports in which \r\nwe participate in the Olympic Games and other \r\ninternational championships.\r\nSport brings about new opportunities for \r\nindividuals, communities and States. It expands global \r\ncommitments to strengthening physical, mental and \r\nemotional health, social welfare and cohesion, while \r\nalso promoting team spirit, solidarity and adherence to \r\nstandards and the rules of the game, and also raising \r\nawareness and increasing the understanding of human \r\nrights.\r\nSport is important in promoting human rights \r\nworldwide through the interactions that it generates \r\namong people from different backgrounds and cultures. \r\nThrough its universal nature, sport can instil in people \r\nthe values of respect, diversity, tolerance and fairness, \r\nthereby serving as a tool to combat all forms of \r\ndiscrimination.\r\nAs a candidate country for the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in the upcoming elections to be held in a \r\nfew days, Mongolia stands strongly committed to the \r\npromotion of human rights, including through sport. \r\nSport has a unique power to convene, mobilize and \r\ninspire. Let us all therefore use sport to help create a \r\nhealthier, happier and more prosperous world, a world \r\nwhere no one is left behind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Whiteley (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States.\r\nToday’s draft resolution A/70/L.3, entitled \r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport \r\nand the Olympic ideal”, highlights the indispensable \r\ninteraction between peace and sport. The EU and its \r\nmember States remain committed to the values of the \r\nOlympic ideal and will spare no effort to promote the \r\nancient, but always timely, concept of the Olympic Truce \r\nas an invaluable means towards peace and solidarity.\r\nThe Olympic Games have historically been \r\nassociated with the ideal of a truce. We consider sport \r\nan invaluable tool to encourage dialogue and mutual \r\nunderstanding among people of different backgrounds. \r\nThe concept of the Olympic Truce provides us with a \r\nunique opportunity to achieve a cessation of hostilities, \r\neven temporarily, and to promote the peaceful resolution \r\nof conflicts. In particular today, when violent extremism \r\nis on the rise, the ideal of the Olympic Truce could serve \r\nas a perfect historical example for reconciliation and \r\npeaceful coexistence, even for a short period of time.\r\nWe warmly thank Brazil for facilitating this year’s \r\ndraft resolution and wish that country every success \r\nfor the 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games. We \r\nparticularly welcome the fact that this year’s draft \r\nresolution includes several positive references to the \r\nprotection of human rights and recognizes that sport \r\ncan be used to promote human rights and strengthen \r\nuniversal respect for them.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to underline once again \r\nour commitment to support the peaceful resolution \r\nof conflicts. I wish to use this opportunity to urge all \r\nMember States to send a message of unity by observing \r\nthe Olympic Truce during the 2016 Olympic Games in \r\nRio de Janeiro.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): Accustomed \r\nto major international events, the city of Rio de Janeiro \r\nis on the verge of again hosting another global event, this \r\ntime from 5 to 21 August 2016 for the Olympic Games \r\nand from 7 to 18 September 2016 for the Paralympic \r\nGames, which are being organized for the first time in \r\na South American country.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco wishes to fully \r\nassociate itself with the commitment to build a peaceful \r\nand better world through the Olympic ideal. This year, \r\nwe welcome draft resolution A/70/L.3, which we \r\nco-sponsored and which will certainly be adopted by \r\nconsensus.\r\nOver 20 years after the inclusion of this item on the \r\nagenda of our Organization, this meeting is another stage \r\nin the process of recognizing sport as an “important \r\nenabler of sustainable development” (resolution 70/1, \r\npara. 37). We are entirely convinced of the\r\n“contribution of sport to the realization of \r\ndevelopment and peace in its promotion of tolerance \r\nand respect and the contributions it makes to the \r\nempowerment of women and of young people, \r\nindividuals and communities, as well as to health, \r\neducation and social inclusion objectives” (ibid.).\r\nThose words, drawn from the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, rightly underscore the role \r\nthat sport plays at all levels.\r\nAllow me to draw attention to the approach of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee (IOC), which has \r\n15-33386 7/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\nmade sustainability the central principle of its work. \r\nIn that respect, the IOC and its various committees \r\nwork with the host country in the process of preparing \r\nfor the Games and ensure that athletes have adequate \r\ninfrastructure for the competitions, but above all and \r\nbeyond the Games, they seek to ensure that there will \r\nbe an improvement in the quality of life of the millions \r\nof inhabitants of Rio de Janeiro. That is reflected in the \r\ncreation of jobs, the provision of training for the host \r\ncity’s inhabitants and the renovation and construction \r\nof new urban sport infrastructure, not to mention the \r\nparticipation of women. As the host city of the Olympic \r\nand Paralympic Games, Rio de Janeiro will be at the \r\ncentre of our planet’s attention next summer. However, \r\nthe heritage of that event will last beyond the intense, \r\nbut f leeting, duration of the Games themselves.\r\nWe wish to pay tribute to the IOC and its President \r\nfor the Olympic Agenda 2020, as well as the numerous \r\nactions that have been taken on the ground, which have \r\nmade the IOC an essential partner. The strengthened \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the IOC \r\nwould not have developed to its current extent without \r\nthe confident and collective commitment of the \r\nSecretary-General and the President of the IOC, which \r\nis enshrined in a framework agreement that forges a \r\nsolid and effective partnership aimed at promoting \r\nthe common ideals and values of the charters of both \r\norganizations. I would also like to pay tribute to the \r\nconstant efforts of the Special Adviser on Sport for \r\nPeace and Development.\r\nWe note that sport’s intrinsic values reflect, in \r\nmany ways, those of our Organization, and that its \r\nvocabulary can easily be adapted to the pledge we \r\nmade in September in adopting the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, namely, to leave no one \r\nbehind in achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. Similarly, the ideals of the Charter of the United \r\nNations — those of the dignity and value of the human \r\nindividual, the equality of the human rights of men and \r\nwomen, social progress and tolerance are all ref lected \r\nin sport. The values of sport that are incorporated into \r\nour daily life enable us to build a more harmonious, \r\nhealthier, calmer and more united society.\r\nBeyond words, how can we realize in practice the \r\nbenefits that sport offers? Sport is the act of transcending \r\noneself to achieve fixed goals by focusing on one’s \r\nskills and strength. Sport also serves communities \r\nby enhancing people’s skills and reducing individual \r\nfailings. We will be able to go farther together in \r\novercoming challenges than we would be able to as \r\nunorganized individuals.\r\nAt a time when there are 70 million displaced \r\npersons and refugees around the world, I would like to \r\npay tribute to the IOC, which is invested in and working \r\ntowards, through the commitment of its Honorary \r\nPresident, the empowerment of those millions of men, \r\nwomen and children and providing them a better life \r\nthrough sport.\r\nThe practice of sport and the Olympic Games \r\nare not only about setting new records. Sport brings \r\ntogether the peoples of the world around three main \r\nvalues, namely, excellence, friendship and respect. \r\nPractising sports and the Olympic ideal are not only \r\nabout winning a medal, but also means participating \r\nside by side, in a spirit of friendship, in the most notable \r\nsports competition that exists, that is, the Olympic \r\nGames and Paralympic Games. We are therefore \r\nimpatiently waiting to see the f lags of the United \r\nNations and the IOC fly together again above the four \r\nOlympic sites in Rio de Janeiro, which will illustrate \r\nthe full synergy between the two organizations. But \r\nbefore that always magical moment when the Olympic \r\nf lame is lit in Rio de Janeiro, the Olympic f lame will \r\nhave travelled to 500 cities, including 300 in Brazil, \r\nallowing the world to become more familiar with that \r\nlarge country. The enthusiasm and hospitality of Rio de \r\nJaneiro will mean that we will soon become familiar \r\nwith the names of Barra da Tijuca, Deodoro, with the \r\nsoccer temples of Maracanã and Copacabana, which \r\nare globally renowned. We wish Brazil every success \r\nin Rio de Janeiro.\r\nMr. Khiari (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme, at the outset, to pay tribute to the United Nations \r\nsupport of sports. I would also like to pay tribute to \r\nMr. Wilfried Lemke, Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace. I would \r\nalso like to welcome Mr. Thomas Bach, President of \r\nthe International Olympic Committee (IOC), and to \r\nreiterate our support for the efforts of the IOC, which \r\nseeks to promote peace and understanding among \r\npeoples through sport and the Olympic ideals, including \r\nthe Olympic Truce.\r\nSport has played a very important role historically \r\nin all communities. That is why nations and peoples \r\nhave promoted sport as part and parcel of their daily \r\nlifestyle and as one dimension of society and culture. \r\nAccordingly, sport has become one of the fundamental \r\nUnited Nations principles and a human right that \r\n8/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\ndeserves to be respected, applied and recognized \r\nas a low-cost and high-impact tool for human aid, \r\ndevelopment and peace, whether in the United Nations, \r\nin non-governmental organizations or in other agencies. \r\nSport is not only practiced in any given community, \r\nbut represents a very important and significant \r\ninvestment in the present and future, especially in \r\ndeveloping countries. Sport plays a very prominent \r\nrole in supporting social integration and economic \r\ndevelopment. Given the pioneering role of sport and \r\nits impact on individuals, sport should be part and \r\nparcel of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), adopted during the exceptional United \r\nNations Summit on sustainable development, because \r\nthe link between sport and development and peace is \r\ngrowing. That translates into an increasing awareness of \r\nthe importance of sport and its linkage to humankind’s \r\naspirations to enjoy its universal rights without any \r\ndiscrimination, thereby according everyone equality of \r\nopportunity.\r\nIn the spirit of using sport as a tool for peace and \r\nsocial development, I would like to express the support \r\nof Tunisia for draft resolution A/70/L.3, which Brazil \r\nsubmitted this year. That draft resolution reiterates the \r\ninternational community’s determination to continue \r\nits efforts to make sport a tool for communication, \r\nreconciliation and human rights. That also promotes \r\nthe importance of the notion that Member States accord \r\npriority to sports in their national policies as a tool for \r\npeace, sustainable development, education and health.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Tunisia’s \r\nsupport to the IOC, noting that the Winter Olympics \r\nwill be held in Pyeongchang, South Korea, in 2018 and \r\nin Tokyo in 2022. That will also be an occasion for \r\npromoting the culture of peace and harmony.\r\nMr. Okamura (Japan): Sport has the power to \r\nnurture dreams and bring people hope. Sport has the \r\npower to change the world, and even the future of \r\nhumankind. High respect must therefore be accorded \r\nto sport. In the spirit of peace, the international \r\ncommunity should once again join together by adopting \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.3, entitled “Building a peaceful \r\nand better world through sport and the Olympic ideal”, \r\nwhich has been adopted biennially since 1993. As \r\nvarious United Nations documents indicate, this draft \r\nresolution has become an expression of humankind’s \r\ndesire to build a world based on the rules of fair \r\ncompetition, peace, humanity and reconciliation, \r\nwhich Japan deeply respects and firmly supports. Japan \r\nappreciates the initiative and leadership of Brazil, \r\nwhich will host the Olympic and Paralympic Games \r\nnext year and has submitted this year’s draft resolution. \r\nAs a co-sponsor, Japan strongly supports the draft \r\nresolution. We firmly believe that next year’s Games, \r\nto be hosted in Rio de Janeiro, will realize the draft \r\nresolution’s ideals and objectives.\r\nJapan will host the Olympic and Paralympic Games \r\nin Tokyo in 2020. It is our great pleasure to set the stage \r\nfor the international community to view the outstanding \r\nperformances of top athletes from all over the world. We \r\nwill also have the privilege of welcoming many diverse \r\nguests to our country from every corner of the world. \r\nJapan is determined to do its best to make that occasion \r\na great success. Japan wants the Tokyo 2020 Games to \r\nrealize the following three ideals: first, achieving one’s \r\npersonal best; secondly, unity in diversity; and, thirdly, \r\nconnecting to tomorrow.\r\nAchieving one’s personal best means that the Tokyo \r\n2020 Games aim to deliver events where every athlete \r\ncan realize his or her greatest athletic performance and \r\nachieve his or her personal best.\r\nUnity in diversity means accepting and respecting \r\ndifferences in race, colour, gender, sexual orientation, \r\nlanguage, religion, political or other opinion, birth, \r\nlevel of ability or other status in support of peace, so \r\nthat society can continue to develop and f lourish. The \r\nTokyo 2020 Games will foster a welcoming environment \r\nand raise awareness of the concept of unity in diversity \r\namong the citizens of the world.\r\nLast but not least, there is connecting to tomorrow. \r\nI recall that half a century ago, the Tokyo 1964 Games \r\ncompletely transformed Japan, enhanced the Japanese \r\npeople’s awareness of the outside world and helped \r\nbring about the rapid growth of Japan’s economy. We \r\nhope the 2020 Games will enable Japan to promote \r\nconstructive changes throughout the world and leave a \r\npositive legacy for future generations. In the lead-up \r\nto 2020, the Japanese Government has been steadily \r\nimplementing various programmes under our Sport for \r\nTomorrow Programme, which is targeted at reaching \r\nover 10 million people in more than 100 countries. \r\nSpecifically, we intend to concentrate on improving \r\nsport facilities and cooperating in sport curriculums \r\nand on design and human-resource development.\r\nJapan will continue promoting sport in collaboration \r\nwith the United Nations Office on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace, other United Nations bodies, Member States \r\n15-33386 9/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\nand non-governmental organizations, so that the 2020 \r\nTokyo Games will inspire people around the world and \r\nleave positive legacies in Japan and in the world.\r\nMs. Vraila (Greece): Greece aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered a few minutes ago by the observer \r\nof the European Union. For reasons that should be clear, \r\nmy delegation wishes make some additional remarks in \r\nits national capacity.\r\nAs far back as the eighth century B.C., the ancient \r\nOlympic Games were meant to be a force for peace \r\nand solidarity among the ancient Greek city-States, \r\nwhich declared a truce starting seven days before the \r\nbeginning and ending seven days after the end of the \r\nGames. The ultimate goal was the peaceful conduct \r\nof the Games by protecting the city from invasion and \r\nby ordering individuals and State authorities to refrain \r\nfrom interfering with the safe passage of the athletes. \r\nAs the historian Thucydides claimed, if States violated \r\nthe truce, their athletes were banned from participating \r\nin the Games.\r\nThe concept of the Olympic Truce was born and \r\ncarried out for 1,200 years back in antiquity. Greeks \r\nsaw the Games as a chance to replace conflict with \r\nfriendly competition. However, the ideal of the \r\nOlympic Truce was also of great importance for the \r\nrevival of the Olympic Games in the modern era, as an \r\ninvaluable tool to advance international understanding \r\nand promote world peace.\r\nIn today’s world, the emphasis on Olympic peace has \r\nbecome a major feature of modern Olympic ideology. \r\nThe foundation of the International Olympic Truce \r\nCentre, in whose creation Greece was actively engaged \r\nalong with the International Olympic Committee, \r\ngave new dynamism to the pursuit of peace. Most \r\nimportantly, the inclusion of the Olympic Truce into \r\nthe United Nations framework, through the adoption of \r\nrelevant resolutions, granted a distinct role to the ideal. \r\nWe should bear in mind that, in a world of differences, \r\ninequalities and conflicts, even an agreement on a \r\ntemporary truce represents an achievement on the part \r\nof the international community. We feel, therefore, \r\nresponsible for continuing to promote the Olympic \r\nTruce, and we will spare no effort to ensure its actual \r\nimplementation.\r\nIn 2016, Brazil will host the XXI Olympic Games \r\nand the XV Paralympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. I \r\nseize this opportunity to wish Brazil every success in \r\nthat demanding endeavour. The task of the rest of us is \r\nto meet our responsibilities by observing the Olympic \r\nTruce and making peace an attainable goal, at least \r\nthis once. We should all find inspiration in next year’s \r\nOlympic Games, and reflect on how sport could be used \r\nas a useful tool to prevent or reduce tensions and build \r\nbridges between nations.\r\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation is pleased with the holding of this debate \r\non the creation of a peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal. Morocco wants to accord \r\nspecial importance to all international organizations \r\nthat promote sport throughout the world. We are \r\nalso pleased at the activities of the International \r\nOlympic Committee and the International Paralympic \r\nCommittee aimed at promoting and strengthening the \r\nculture of peace based on the spirit of the Olympic \r\nTruce. My delegation also welcomes the proclamation \r\nby the General Assembly of the International Day of \r\nSport for Development and Peace on 6 April, which \r\nis intended to highlight the contribution of sport and \r\nphysical exercise to education, human development, \r\nthe adoption of healthy lifestyles and the building \r\nof a more peaceful world. We are also pleased to be \r\nco-sponsoring draft resolution A/70/L.3, presented this \r\nyear by Brazil, which we hope the General Assembly \r\nwill adopt by consensus.\r\nSince the dawn of human civilization, sport \r\nhas always made a major contribution to bridging \r\npoints of view and bringing countries closer together. \r\nSport has the unique ability to attract, mobilize and \r\ninspire people throughout the world. It knows neither \r\ngeographic borders nor social classes. It is an important \r\nelement of social inclusion and fulfilment that enables \r\nthe strengthening of relations and the promotion of the \r\nideals of peace, fraternity, solidarity, non-violence, \r\ntolerance and justice.\r\nMorocco is pleased at the similarity of principles \r\nunderlying both the United Nations and the Olympic \r\nspirit. The Olympic ideals are very similar to those of \r\nthe United Nations, whether we are talking about civil, \r\npolitical, economic, social or cultural rights. Moreover, \r\nwe are pleased at the presence of the United Nations f lag \r\nat all Olympic events, which brings to mind the common \r\nobjective of the United Nations and the International \r\nOlympic Committee. During sports events we have a \r\nreal opportunity to promote knowledge, understanding \r\nand the enforcement of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights. That is an ideal opportunity to convey \r\nmessages of peace and tolerance — educational \r\n10/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\nmessages that correct stereotypes and clichés, call \r\nfor the fight against ignorance, intolerance and \r\ndiscrimination, and encourage the bridging of cultural \r\ndifferences. My delegation highlights the crucial \r\nrole and the important and long-lasting contributions \r\nof sport to the dissemination and realization of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals announced in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco has a national programme \r\nfor sport and development. Since 2008, Morocco has \r\nhad in place a strategy that makes it possible to ensure \r\nthat the practice of sports and its values are part of \r\ndaily life, to affirm sport as a fundamental right and \r\na crucial element of social integration, and to extend \r\naccess to sport while encouraging the creation of \r\nsport associations. His Majesty the King believes in \r\ngiving a strong impetus to development, with sport as \r\na fundamental element assisting in the development of \r\nthe capacities and personal skills of young people. That \r\nhas always been one of the strategic priorities of the \r\nKingdom of Morocco, whether it be youth education, \r\ntraining, access to the labour market, the participation \r\nof young people in political life or their contribution to \r\nthe economic, social and cultural areas of life. Every \r\nindividual must have the possibility of practising \r\nsport without any discrimination. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation emphasizes the particular importance of \r\nensuring the participation of women, girls and persons \r\nwith disabilities in all sports activities in order to \r\nenshrine the principle of equality between men and \r\nwomen and to end stereotyping.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\nreiterate its determination to strengthen international \r\nbrotherhood, friendship, goodwill and unity among \r\npeoples through sport, for there is no better way \r\nto inculcate and encourage the values of respect \r\nfor diversity and tolerance among communities, \r\ncivilizations and cultures. Furthermore, peace and \r\nnon-violence are some of the basic values that we are \r\nworking to defend.\r\nMs. Liew (Singapore): Singapore looks forward to \r\ntoday’s adoption of draft resolution A/70/L.3, entitled \r\n“Building a peaceful and better world through sport and \r\nthe Olympic ideal”. We are pleased to be a sponsor of \r\nthe draft resolution, introduced by Brazil, and welcome \r\nthe ideals represented by the Olympic Truce.\r\nSport brings many benefits to societies. Besides \r\nencouraging healthy lifestyles, it helps to build social \r\ncapital and inspires the human spirit. More important, \r\nit is a profound way of bringing people together in the \r\npursuit of excellence, while transcending differences in \r\nsocioeconomic backgrounds, cultures and nationalities. \r\nThe Olympic Games, the pinnacle of sporting \r\nachievement, have helped to promote peace, tolerance \r\nand solidarity all over the world. The Olympic Agenda \r\n2020, approved by the International Olympic Committee \r\nin December 2014, is a strategic road map for our global \r\nefforts to promote the Olympic movement, safeguard its \r\nideals and strengthen the value of sport in sustainable \r\ndevelopment. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank Mr. Thomas Bach, President of the International \r\nOlympic Committee, for his foresight and leadership in \r\ndriving these reforms.\r\nThe Olympic Games have been a source of \r\ninspiration for us in building a strong sporting culture \r\nin Singapore. Our Vision 2030 master plan is best \r\ndescribed as the story of how sport can be used as a \r\nnational strategy for developing healthy and resilient \r\npeople, forging strong, united communities, instilling \r\ncore values, creating shared memories and building a \r\ndynamic society and economy. The attributes that sport \r\nembodies — tenacity, discipline, teamwork, leadership \r\nand a love of country — are what we need as we compete \r\nin a more globalized environment while maintaining \r\nSingapore’s social cohesion and sense of identity. These \r\nare principles that we want to be firmly rooted not just \r\nin our athletes but throughout our society. We believe \r\nwe can live better through sport.\r\nLast June, Singapore hosted the twenty-eighth \r\nSoutheast Asian Games, a biennial multisport event \r\nwith the participation of more than 4,000 athletes. The \r\ngames echo the timeless Olympic values of excellence, \r\nfriendship and respect. What shone through was \r\nthe spirit of friendship among the peoples of South-\r\nEast Asia. While athletes competed intensely and \r\nspectators cheered vociferously, spectators and athletes \r\nalike exemplified sportsmanship and were gracious \r\neven in defeat. It is heartwarming to see how sport \r\nforges common bonds and brings peoples of different \r\nnationalities closer together, building a more peaceful \r\nand better world.\r\nIn December, Singapore will have the honour of \r\nhosting the Para Games of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations for the first time. The event celebrates \r\nthe triumph of the human spirit against all odds and \r\nexemplifies the Paralympic values of determination, \r\ninspiration, courage and equality. The theme of the \r\nGames, “Celebrate the extraordinary”, pays tribute \r\n15-33386 11/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\nto the tremendous courage and spirit of para-athletes, \r\nwho have overcome great challenges not just to lead \r\nactive lives but to excel in their various domains. \r\nThrough the Games, we hope to inspire more persons \r\nwith disabilities to overcome challenges and blaze new \r\ntrails, and help to produce a society that is as inclusive \r\nas possible.\r\nThe role of sport as an enabler of sustainable \r\ndevelopment is duly recognized in the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). As the \r\nUnited Nations and its Member States embark upon the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda, Singapore firmly \r\nbelieves that we should harness the value of sport as \r\nan inspiration to aim higher and do development better \r\nin our race to build a more inclusive, sustainable and \r\nprosperous future for our peoples.\r\nMr. Al-Sowaidi (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): Qatar is \r\nalso pleased to be a sponsor of today’s draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.3, entiled “Building a peaceful and better world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nThe outcome document of the United Nations \r\nsummit for the adoption of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development” (resolution 70/1), cites sport \r\nas an important enabler of sustainable development. \r\nIt recognizes sport’s growing contribution to the \r\nrealization of development and peace through its \r\npromotion of tolerance and respect and the contributions \r\nit makes to the empowerment of women, young people, \r\nindividuals and societies.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to highlight \r\nour national experience in this area. Qatar is a firm \r\nbeliever in the role that sport plays in promoting \r\npeace, development and dialogue among civilizations. \r\nWithin the framework of anchoring the 2030 Agenda in \r\nQatar’s national vision, and with the goal of achieving \r\nthat vision of a healthy, active society both physically \r\nand psychologically, Qatar proclaimed 2 February an \r\nannual national day of sport, beginning in 2012. It is a \r\npublic holiday in Qatar, ref lecting an initiative that is \r\nunique in the world. Its aim is to focus on and deepen \r\nunderstanding of sport in the community and increase \r\npopular participation in various sporting activities. We \r\nare working to that end by ensuring best practices and by \r\npromoting and encouraging the effective participation \r\nof all members of society in celebrating the holiday and \r\nin sports activities.\r\nThe General Assembly has addressed the issue \r\nof building a more peaceful and better world through \r\nsport and the Olympic ideal on many occasions, \r\nhighlighting the important role of sport in enhancing \r\neducation, health, development and peace. The work of \r\nQatar’s Ministry of Youth and Sport is based on similar \r\naims, and it oversees the curriculums for students aged \r\nbetween 15 and 18 in many areas of sport. To date, \r\nmore than 26,000 students have benefitted from such \r\nactivities.\r\nOur national Olympic committee has signed a \r\nmemorandum of understanding with the Alliance for \r\nCivilization of the United Nations whereby it takes part \r\nin programmes and activities aimed at promoting peace \r\nand development through sport. In Geneva in 2013, we \r\nalso had the honour of co-chairing, with Costa Rica, the \r\nGroup of Friends of Sport for Development.\r\nWe attach particular importance to sport at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. As we are \r\ndiscussing this item today, Qatar has successfully \r\nhosted the Paralympic Games in order to integrate all \r\nmembers of society and to promote the advancement of \r\ncommunities. We also underscore the importance of the \r\nDoha GOALS Forum, which since 2012 has served as a \r\nforum for international development initiatives through \r\nsports, sponsored by His Excellency Sheikh Tamim \r\nbin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar. The \r\nQatar Olympic Committee is playing an important role \r\nin preparing Qatar to host the FIFA World Cup in 2022, \r\nwhich will be an exceptional occasion to reinforce the \r\nvalues of peace, development and understanding among \r\nall peoples of the world. It will be the first time that an \r\nevent of such scale will be hosted in the Arab world. In \r\nthis regard, we are also planning to organize a high-\r\nlevel event, with the participation of other countries, \r\nat the United Nations on the economic, social and \r\ndevelopment role played by sport. We plan to share the \r\nlessons learned and experiences with other countries \r\nthat have hosted other major sporting events in the past. \r\nIn conclusion, we would like to emphasize the \r\nimportance of sports in building a world of peace and \r\nunderstanding with a view of promoting harmony and \r\ndevelopment, nationally and globally.\r\nMr. Kaganda (United Republic of Tanzania): We \r\ncongratulate Brazil, host of the 2016 Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games, for the excellent facilitation of \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.3, which we are about to adopt \r\nand which Tanzania has gladly co-sponsored. We \r\n12/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\nwould also like to acknowledge the great work being \r\nundertaken by the International Olympic Committee, \r\nthe International Paralympic Committee and the United \r\nNations Office on Sport for Development and Peace in \r\npromoting peace and understanding through sport and \r\nthe Olympic ideal.\r\nThe 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games will \r\ncoincide with the commemoration of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations. This meeting \r\ntherefore presents a unique opportunity to assess \r\nthe contribution of sport in advancing the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nespecially in building an atmosphere of tolerance \r\nand understanding among peoples and nations, as \r\nenvisioned in the outcome of the 2005 World Summit. In \r\naddition to the commemoration, the meeting coincides \r\nwith the adoption of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), which recognizes sport \r\nas an important enabler of sustainable development. \r\nDespite that recognition, however, many people in \r\ncountries across the world, especially in developing \r\ncountries, have yet to realize the full benefits of sport. \r\nMany are trapped in situations, including conflicts and \r\ncolonial occupation, which inhibit their enjoyment of a \r\nsocial activity that dates back to ancient times. Those \r\npeople deserve better. They must not be left behind. \r\nThat is why we welcome and support the work being \r\nundertaken by all national, regional and international \r\nstakeholders in promoting and strengthening a culture \r\nof peace based on the Greek tradition of the Olympic \r\nTruce. We call for the full cooperation of all Member \r\nStates in realizing the objective of that just endeavour. \r\nWe also call upon Member States and other stakeholders \r\nto include sport, where appropriate, as a complement to \r\nconflict-prevention and peacebuilding efforts.\r\nTanzania believes that sport is an important \r\ntool for building national unity, fostering gender \r\nequality and women’s empowerment, education, \r\nhealth, development, peace and conflict prevention \r\nand resolution. Consequently, since the birth of our \r\nnation, sport has been accorded ample attention, \r\nincluding through the promulgation of policies and \r\nlegislation as well as through the establishment of the \r\nMinistry of Youth, Culture and Sport. Among the chief \r\npreoccupations of the newly independent Tanzania \r\nwas the restoration of several traditional sports, \r\nwhich, inter alia, served as a symbol of national pride. \r\nGames and sports such as archery, Bao — a form of \r\nMancala — wrestling, swimming, running, tug-of-\r\nwar, javelin, stick fighting, rope skipping and oxen \r\nracing, which were prevalent in pre-colonial Africa, \r\nwere either altered or eliminated entirely, as they \r\nwere perceived as either primitive or pagan in nature. \r\nWe therefore ensured that all persons, irrespective of \r\ntheir age, sex, religion or tribe, participated in sporting \r\nactivities, which were and are still conducted at the \r\nprimary, secondary and higher education levels, as well \r\nas among Government employees, through the annual \r\ninter-ministerial sports competition.\r\nLike the United Nations, the strength and uniqueness \r\nof the Olympic establishment is its diversity, reflected \r\nby the participating nations that are united in support of \r\nits ideals. We are very satisfied that the organizers have \r\nmade every effort to involve persons with disabilities, \r\nthrough the Paralympic Games. We are concerned, \r\nhowever, by the uneven representation of developed \r\nand developing countries that are participating. It is \r\nimperative, therefore, that we foster partnerships and \r\nenhance cooperation to bridge that gap. We need to \r\nbuild lasting and mutually beneficial partnerships to \r\npromote sport among youth, for we know too well that, \r\nin addition to other benefits, sport can be an important \r\nsource of livelihood. Tanzania’s doors are open to \r\nsuch partnerships, including in the development of the \r\nnecessary infrastructure for training young persons \r\nin different sports. Only recently, His Excellency \r\nMr. Jakaya Mrisho Kikwete, President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, inaugurated a state-of-the-art \r\ncommunity-based sports park, which was developed in \r\npartnership with the Symbion Power Company of the \r\nUnited States of America and Sunderland Association \r\nFootball Club/A.F.C. of the United Kingdom.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to voice our dismay \r\nat the continued racism and xenophobic tendencies in \r\nsport. We note that such tendencies run counter to the \r\nspirit and principles of both the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the Olympic Games. We recall paragraph \r\n218 of the Durban Declaration and Programme of \r\nAction, which urges Member States, in cooperation \r\nwith the relevant Olympic bodies, to intensify the fight \r\nagainst racism in sport, including through education \r\nand raising awareness of the Olympic spirit, which \r\ncalls for human understanding, tolerance, fair play and \r\nsolidarity. We believe that the International Day of \r\nSport for Development and Peace, to be observed on \r\n6 April, should be used to address some of those thorny \r\nand regrettable issues.\r\nMr. Narang (India): We welcome the emphasis \r\nthe General Assembly has laid on sport as an agent of \r\n15-33386 13/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\npeace and an instrument of development. India strongly \r\nconcurs with the recognition of sport as an ideal to be \r\npursued for several noble objectives that are at the heart \r\nof the Organization’s work.\r\nIn ancient Indian tradition, exercise and sport \r\nwere considered an inseparable part of good health. \r\nAs an old proverb in Sanskrit emphasizes, the virtue \r\nof health is the basis of all achievements. The author \r\nof the proverb is extolling the benefit of exercise and \r\nsport for health, long age, strength, freedom from \r\ndisease and ultimately, happiness. Sport plays an \r\nimportant role at both the individual and social levels. \r\nAt the individual level, as the Sanskrit proverb notes, \r\nsport is directly linked with good health, an important \r\nobjective of development policy and, needless to say, \r\nnow a dedicated Sustainable Development Goal.\r\nAt the same time, sport also builds character. It \r\nhelps motivate children and youth, inculcating in them \r\nthe much-needed esprit de corps, a sense of partnership \r\nwith others. It also develops leadership skills, a spirit of \r\nsharing, of competing fairly and of respecting others. \r\nAt the social level, on the other hand, there can indeed \r\nbe no more powerful tool than sport to inspire and bring \r\npeople together for a common purpose. Principles such \r\nas non-discrimination and equality, including gender \r\nequality, and the foundation of all human rights can \r\nbe taught through sports. Sport also helps foster peace \r\nand a feeling of friendship among all nations and all \r\npeoples.\r\nWe are happy that the contribution of sport as an \r\nimportant enabler of sustainable development has been \r\nduly noted by our leaders in the Declaration of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), which has correctly recognized the growing \r\ncontribution of sport to the realization of development \r\nand peace in its promotion of tolerance and respect \r\nand the contributions it makes to the empowerment of \r\nwomen, young people, individuals and communities, \r\nas well as to health, education and social inclusion \r\nobjectives.\r\nIndia wholeheartedly recognizes the invaluable \r\ncontribution of the Olympic Movement in establishing \r\nsport as an ideal means for the promotion of peace, \r\ngood neighbourliness and development. We welcome \r\nthe upcoming Summer Olympic Games and Paralympic \r\nGames, to be held in Rio de Janeiro. We wish our friends \r\nfrom Brazil every success in hosting this remarkable \r\ncelebration of the human spirit. In the same vein, we \r\nalso would like to commend the efforts of the organizers \r\nof several such events earlier this year. To mention \r\nonly a few, there were the Special Olympics World \r\nSummer Games in Los Angeles, the Cricket World \r\nCup in Australia and New Zealand, the Fédération \r\ninternationale de football association Women’s World \r\nCup in Canada, the Universidad in the Republic of \r\nKorea and the European Games in Azerbaijan.\r\nAt the national level in India, sports, games and \r\nphysical fitness have been an integral part of the Indian \r\nheritage, evident even today not only in the highly \r\nevolved system of yoga, but also in the vast range of \r\nindigenous games and martial arts practised in different \r\nparts of India. A young and resurgent India has once \r\nagain embraced sport. That is evident in the revival \r\nof several sports, not to mention hockey and kabaddi, \r\nwhich are today competing with cricket for prime-time \r\ntelevision viewership. Yet India is a developing \r\ncountry where the sporting infrastructure has not \r\nbeen able to match the growing demand. Our higher \r\npopulation density has also meant a comparative lack \r\nof open access, especially in urban areas. The Indian \r\nGovernment is actively engaged in these issues to make \r\nsure that sport remains available to every Indian.\r\nAllow me to also highlight the important role of \r\nyoga as a practice for both physical and mental health. \r\nRecognizing the rich and proven expertise of this \r\nancient practice for building healthy individuals and \r\ncommunities, the Government of India has redoubled \r\nits efforts to promote yoga as an important health \r\nand sporting activity throughout the country. In that \r\ncontext, the Assembly’s decision in the past year to \r\ncommemorate 21 June as the International Day of \r\nYoga and the unprecedented celebration of the first \r\nInternational Day of Yoga, right here at the United \r\nNations earlier this year, are particularly gratifying for \r\nmy delegation. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto thank the General Assembly, and indeed the entire \r\nmembership, for their valuable support.\r\nThe former President of South Africa, Nelson \r\nMandela, who famously used sport for social harmony \r\nand peace, could not have put it better when he said of \r\nsport, “It speaks to youth in a language they understand”. \r\nWe would therefore do well to use this tool that speaks \r\na universal language in the pursuit of our universally \r\nrecognized goals of peace and development.\r\nAllow me to conclude by again emphasizing \r\nIndia’s sincere belief that sports and all sporting \r\nevents strengthen the cherished ties of goodwill and \r\nunderstanding that unite us as one family.\r\n14/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\nMr. Lambertini (Italy): Italy aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered by the observer of the European \r\nUnion at the beginning of this meeting and wishes to \r\nmake the following additional remarks in its national \r\ncapacity.\r\nMy country welcomes the imminent adoption of \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.3 and is proud to be among its \r\nsponsors. The clear consensus of the General Assembly \r\non this issue demonstrates that the ideal of the Olympic \r\nTruce is alive and powerful. We must now translate \r\nthat commitment into reality. In a time of persistent \r\ninstability and increasing challenges, we applaud \r\nthe message sent by the draft resolution of sport as a \r\nmeans of prevention. In effect, its universal language \r\ncan bridge gaps and promote the core values necessary \r\nfor tolerance and lasting peace. On the playing field, \r\ncultural, linguistic, religious, social and ideological \r\ndifferences disappear. We also highly appreciate \r\nthe emphasis this year on vulnerable groups, such as \r\nchildren, persons with disabilities, women and girls, as \r\nwell as the need to engage them in the practice of sports \r\nfor peace and development.\r\nItaly is a strong believer in sport as a powerful tool \r\nand vehicle to promote peace and development and \r\nis proud to be part of the Group of Friends of Sport \r\nfor Development and Peace. That is also why in 2009 \r\nwe actively supported the adoption of resolution 64/3, \r\nwhich granted observer status to the International \r\nOlympic Committee in the General Assembly, and we \r\nwelcome President Bach and Vice-President Pescante.\r\nMore recently, in 2014, we organized at the United \r\nNations in New York an event on children, sport and \r\ndevelopment, with an inter-campus programme, a \r\nnon-profit social event that instituted the famous Italian \r\nsoccer team Internazionale Milano, which provides \r\nassistance to needy children and young people in 29 \r\ncountries around the world. Its aim is to give back to \r\nchildren the right to play through football programmes, \r\nteach youths team work and the meaning of fair play \r\nand give them access to health and education services, \r\nwhich are very often absent from their villages. The \r\nmain message of the event was that sport is a crucial \r\nmeans to promote sustainable development. It has \r\nalready proved to be a cost-effective and f lexible tool \r\nin promoting peace and security objectives.\r\nSince the inception of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, in 2000, sport played a vital role in advancing \r\neach of the eight goals. We are convinced that sports \r\nwill also be a powerful tool to achieve the 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals that we have recently adopted.\r\nAs Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon once said, sport \r\nhas become a world language, a common denominator \r\nthat breaks down all the walls, all the barriers. It is in \r\nthat spirit that we wish the best success to Brazil for \r\nthe organization of the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de \r\nJaneiro.\r\nMs. Kasese-Bota (Zambia): I thank the President \r\nfor according my delegation an opportunity to contribute \r\nto this very important agenda item, which focuses on \r\nthe role of sport in the promotion of development and \r\npeace. The introduction of this year’s draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.3) is very timely, coming just one month after \r\nour Heads of State and Government adopted the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \r\nand the commemoration of 70 years of existence of the \r\nUnited Nations during the high-level debate, in which \r\ncountries recommitted to the ideals of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, espousing international peace and \r\nsecurity. Zambia recognizes the valuable role that sport \r\nplays in the promotion of peace, dialogue, reconciliation, \r\nnational and regional cooperation and solidarity, \r\neducation, health and sustainable development.\r\nAs a sport-loving country, Zambia reaffirms \r\nits commitments to the provision of the necessary \r\nlegal framework as well as financial support for the \r\nintegration of sport in the national development agenda. \r\nIn that regard, physical education has been incorporated \r\nas part of our country’s educational curriculum starting \r\nfor students at a very early age. Zambia acknowledges \r\nthat sport is an important medium for the promotion of \r\nharmony and a unifier of people of all political, social \r\nand religious affiliations. Sport has been used as a \r\nmeans of recreation, healthy life style and as a crowd-\r\npulling medium for the dissemination of life-saving \r\nmessages, including those concerning HIV/AIDS in \r\nboth primary and secondary schools. Consequently, a \r\nnumber of community projects have been implemented, \r\nand they have successfully revealed the power of sport \r\nin bringing positive social transformation. The projects \r\ninclude the Go Sisters! programme, which focuses on \r\nempowering girls and women between the ages of 12 \r\nand 25 to take on leadership roles in their communities, \r\nwith peer-leaders creating self-managed, organizing \r\ncommittees to plan and lead educational and sports \r\nprogrammes. A number of street kids, orphaned \r\nchildren and those affected by HIV/AIDS have been \r\n15-33386 15/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\nenrolled in those programmes, which have yielded very \r\npositive results.\r\nSport has furthermore been identified as an \r\nimportant skill and career pursued by young people, \r\nwhich provides meaningful and very sustainable income \r\nacross all age groups. Therefore, young people are being \r\nmade aware of the profitability of pursuing sport as a \r\nprofession. In that regard, the Zambian Government, \r\nin conjunction with sports associations, has embarked \r\nupon enhancing talent identification and promoting \r\nexcellence in that field. Zambia remains committed \r\nto the promotion of sport for development and peace \r\nby supporting, among other things, the national \r\nParalympic Committee, an institution that coordinates \r\nsports programmes for people with disabilities. The \r\nGovernment is also making efforts to construct user-\r\nfriendly sports facilities to accommodate various \r\ndisciplines in sport.\r\nZambia is a beneficiary of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee’s pilot programme Sports for Hope, which \r\nbuilt a multi-purpose centre for the Olympic Truce \r\nin Lusaka. The Olympic youth development centre \r\nhas served sportsmen and sportswomen from all \r\nover Africa. The centre houses modern facilities for \r\nfootball, hockey and other athletics. It also attracts \r\nunderprivileged youth within Lusaka and gives them a \r\nchance to unleash and fulfil their potential for sports by \r\nparticipating and training at the centre.\r\nOur modern sports infrastructure enabled Zambia \r\nto successfully host the 2012 under-20 youth games \r\nof the Supreme Council for Sport in Africa, zone 6 \r\nunder the confederation of sports associations. The \r\nsuccessful hosting of those tournaments at the centre \r\nhas prompted the Government to consider larger-scale \r\ncontinental games in the future. Zambia also uses the \r\npractices of the International Olympic Committee as \r\na model throughout the country. The Government has \r\naccordingly embarked upon the construction of sports \r\nfacilities in all the provinces of Zambia.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to underscore Zambia’s \r\ncommitment to youth sport in fostering peace and \r\nsustainable development at national, regional and global \r\nlevels. Zambia stands ready to work with all cooperating \r\npartners to promote various sport disciplines in order to \r\nmaintain peace and achieve sustainable development.\r\nMr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba has traditionally been a co-sponsor of the draft \r\nresolution (A/70/L.3) before us, presented by Brazil. \r\nWe will continue to back efforts to promote sport as \r\na way to promote the development of peace and well-\r\nbeing, as well as the achievement of goals in health, \r\neducation, social inclusion and the empowerment of \r\nwomen, young people and communities, in general, \r\nin compliance with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1).\r\nCuba has put the development of mass sport \r\nat the service of improving the quality of life for \r\nthe population, and practising sport is free for all \r\ncitizens. Guaranteeing the enjoyment of sport as a \r\nconstitutional right for all Cubans is one of the most \r\nimportant achievements of the Cuban Revolution in the \r\nfield of human rights. Today, the practice of sport is \r\nwidespread throughout the country, thereby allowing \r\nthe Cuban population to achieve high fitness levels, \r\nwith the majority of beneficiaries being women. The \r\ninclusion of physical education as a subject within \r\nthe national education system and the establishment \r\nof specialized education centres that provide specific \r\nphysical education programmes have played a vital role \r\nin achieving those goals.\r\nCuba has trained a considerable number of men and \r\nwomen teachers and professors who are specialized in \r\nphysical education. They implement our strategy to \r\npromote a culture of physical well-being and health \r\nin the community, including via fitness and therapy \r\ncentres. The are also responsible for our programmes \r\nto promote good health and prevention within groups \r\nrepresentative of the elderly, pregnant and nursing \r\nwomen, as well as community aerobic groups and basic \r\ngymnastic groups for women, all of which make up \r\nour development strategy. Cuba has a broad network \r\nof sports facilities with services in all municipalities of \r\nthe country, which encourage the the practice of sport \r\nwithin the general population.\r\nThe broad coverage of sport education is supported \r\nthrough the system of sport education established \r\nby the Cuban State. Each province has a university \r\ndepartment/faculty for physical culture. There is \r\nan institute of physical culture at the national level, \r\neight schools that train physical education teachers at \r\nthe intermediary level and an international school of \r\nphysical education and sport. The latter school was \r\ninaugurated in 2000, opening its doors to the first \r\nstudents coming from the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. Today, it is still graduating thousands of young \r\npeople hailing from developing countries. One of the \r\nachievements of the training within the institutions of \r\n16/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\nthe sports education system has led to the establishment \r\nof specialized centres for training athletes, including \r\ntop-level professional athletes. Cuba has developed one \r\nof the most advanced sports medicine systems, including \r\none of the best-equipped anti-doping laboratories, as \r\nrecognized by the International Olympic Committee. \r\nThat modern laboratory reflects Cuba’s commitment to \r\ncombating doping in sport.\r\nCuban sport is currently in very good health and \r\nenjoys widespread recognition at both the regional and \r\ninternational Olympic levels, as evidenced not only in \r\nthe outcome of every competition at every level, but also \r\nin the solidarity and cooperation that Cuba provides \r\nto countries that so request, by dispatching sports \r\nprofessionals to them. Cuba’s presence, expressed \r\nthrough its global solidarity with trainers and physical \r\neducation teachers, upholds the prestige of Cuban sport. \r\nCuba has supported the sporting achievements of many \r\ncountries and will continue to do so to the best of its \r\nabilities.\r\nAll those achievements, both at the national level \r\nand in terms of cooperation, have been made possible \r\nthanks to the will of the Cuban Government and people. \r\nHowever, our efforts aimed at the full exercise of that \r\nright have been thwarted for more than 50 years by \r\nthe genocidal policy of the economic, financial and \r\ncommercial blockade imposed on Cuba. To give just \r\none example, Cuban sporting institutions have been \r\nprevented from acquiring in the American market tools, \r\nequipment and uniforms such as pole- and high-jump \r\nmats, Multimarc folding hoops for artistic gymnastics, \r\nCanondale bicycles and electronic measuring equipment \r\nfor athletic training, among other things.\r\nFinally, Cuba reaffirms its commitment to \r\npromoting sport both for the Cuban people and for the \r\nbrotherly countries that need our modest contribution \r\nand experience in that realm.\r\nMr. Crilchuk (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, allow me to commend the work being done at \r\nthe United Nations by the Group of Friends of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, which aims to promote sports \r\nas a means for promoting citizenship and friendship. \r\nWe also commend the expected adoption of draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.3, which was sponsored by Brazil \r\nand co-sponsored by my country. Furthermore, I would \r\nlike to highlight Brazil’s crucial work in organizing the \r\nupcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games to be held in \r\n2016, for the first time in our region. We are convinced \r\nthat the Games will be successful and that they will \r\nbring together many athletes from across the world.\r\nMuch has been said about how sports can play a key \r\nrole in the United Nations efforts to improve the lives of \r\npeople around the world. Sports build bridges between \r\npeople and communities and prepares fertile soil for \r\npeace. By promoting a philosophy of life based on \r\nthe Olympic Game of exerting oneself for excellence, \r\ndemonstrating respect and celebrating friendship, the \r\nOlympics show that sport can help to build a better \r\nworld. Those efforts are closely related to the initiatives \r\nand important programmes that many Member States \r\nand international organizations have undertaken in \r\norder to advance sport in a comprehensive fashion \r\ncomparable to achievements in the social realm. \r\nThe importance of sport in the new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) provides an \r\nexample of that.\r\nIn Argentina, we have implemented a national sport \r\npolicy, and we promote healthy practices that foster \r\nthe values that promote people’s holistic development, \r\nincluding commitment, solidarity, fellowship and \r\nrespect for diversity. In that regard, for the past decade \r\nArgentina has been developing the concept of social \r\nsport, by which we mean the practice of physical and \r\nsporting activities geared to the population as a whole, \r\nirrespective of age, gender, physical condition or social \r\nor ethnic origin, and which in its various guises generates \r\ninclusion, thereby making sports an endeavour that \r\nencourages comprehensive human development. We \r\nsee with satisfaction that those elements are reflected \r\nin the draft resolution that we are about to adopt.\r\nAs members of the Assembly know, the city of \r\nBuenos Aires was chosen for the third Summer Youth \r\nOlympics, which will be held in 2018. We believe that \r\nthe selection of Buenos Aires expresses the international \r\ncommunity’s recognition of Argentina’s achievements \r\nin sport and the socioeconomic development of our \r\ncountry in recent years.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to indicate that by adopting \r\nthis draft resolution, we propose to continue sending \r\na clear message of peace and international goodwill \r\nto the inhabitants of the world. As a sponsor of the \r\ndraft resolution, we call upon everyone to observe \r\nthe Olympic Truce, an ancient tradition that makes \r\nit possible for athletes and others to take part in the \r\nGames under secure conditions, mobilizing the peoples \r\nof the world in the name of peace.\r\n15-33386 17/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\nMr. Yaremenko (Ukraine): Ukraine fully \r\nsupports the adoption by consensus of draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.3, on building a peaceful and better world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal. Traditionally, \r\nUkraine is one of the States that have co-sponsored \r\nthat resolution. However, the draft resolution contains a \r\nprovision noting the successful conclusion of the XXII \r\nOlympic Winter Games and the XI Paralympic Winter \r\nGames held in Sochi, the Russian Federation, from \r\n7 to 23 February 2014 and from 7 to 16 March 2014, \r\nrespectively. We believe that this provision directly \r\ncontradicts the ancient Greek tradition of ekecheiria, \r\nthe Olympic Truce. During those games, the Russian \r\nFederation cynically violated the Olympic Truce. \r\nIt illegally occupied and annexed the autonomous \r\nrepublic of Crimea, Ukraine, and still continues its \r\naggression against my country. Taking those facts into \r\nconsideration, this year Ukraine regrettably had to \r\nabstain from co-sponsoring the draft resolution.\r\nNevertheless, I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto wish Brazil every success and to stress our full and \r\nsincere support for its hosting of the 2016 Olympic \r\nGames and Paralympic Games, as well as promoting \r\nand strengthening a culture of peace based on the spirit \r\nof the Olympic Truce.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 64/3, of 19 October 2009, I now \r\ncall on the President of the International Olympic \r\nCommittee.\r\nMr. Bach (International Olympic Committee) \r\n(spoke in French): The International Olympic \r\nCommittee (IOC) is honoured to take the f loor today \r\nbefore the General Assembly.\r\nThe IOC would like to thank the Government \r\nof Brazil and its representatives to the United \r\nNations for having submitted to the Assembly draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.3. We would also like to express \r\nour sincere gratitude to the Group of Friends of \r\nSport for Development and Peace, co-chaired by the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco and Tunisia, and to all the \r\nStates that sponsored the draft resolution, as well \r\nas the Special Adviser of the Secretary-General for \r\nSport for Development and Peace for supporting the \r\nincorporation and integration of sport into the work of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nBoth the United Nations and the IOC are built on \r\nthe shared values of tolerance, solidarity and peace. \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon described this in the \r\nbest way, namely, that “Olympic principles are United \r\nNations principles”.\r\nThe IOC applauds the General Assembly once \r\nagain for recognizing sport as an important enabler to \r\nfoster peace and understanding in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1). As during \r\nthe most recent United Nations sustainable development \r\nsummit, I want to emphasize that the United Nations \r\nand all its Member States can count on the unwavering \r\nsupport of the IOC to achieve our common goal of the \r\npeaceful development of humankind.\r\nWith our Olympic Agenda 2020, we are fully \r\naligned with the United Nations 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. In particular, that is \r\ntrue of Sustainable Development Goal 16, which is \r\nabout building accountable, effective and inclusive \r\ninstitutions. The IOC, with its Olympic Agenda 2020, \r\nhas ensured that we are in compliance with the highest \r\nstandards of good governance and transparency. In that \r\nrespect, we are asking other major sports organizations \r\nto undertake the necessary swift reforms in order to \r\nrestore their reputations.\r\nThe Olympic Truce stands for our shared values \r\nof tolerance, solidarity and peace. Sport is in a unique \r\nposition to put the spirit of the Olympic Truce into \r\npractice. Sport is the only area of human experience \r\nthat has achieved universal law. Regardless of where in \r\nthe world we practice sport, the rules are the same and \r\napply to everyone. They are based on our shared values. \r\nSport is always about building bridges — it is never \r\nabout erecting walls.\r\nWe can only build bridges if our autonomy and \r\nour neutrality are respected. In the mutual interest of \r\nboth sport and politics, I urge the Assembly to continue \r\nto protect and strengthen the autonomy of sport, as \r\nit did in adopting resolution 69/6 last October, which \r\nrecognizes the autonomy of sport.\r\nIn Olympic sport, all people are equal regardless \r\nof their race, gender, social status, cultural or political \r\nbackground, faith or belief. That fundamental principle \r\nof non-discrimination allows sport to promote peace \r\nand understanding among all people. The Olympic \r\nGames are the culmination of that vision. The Olympic \r\nGames is the time when the values of tolerance, \r\nsolidarity and peace are brought to life. It is the time \r\nwhen the international community comes together for \r\npeaceful competition.\r\n18/20 15-33386\r\nA/70/PV.39 26/10/2015\r\nIn the Olympic Village, we see tolerance and \r\nsolidarity in their purest form. Athletes from all 206 \r\nNational Olympic Committees are living together \r\nin harmony, without any kind of discrimination. It \r\nrepresents the true spirit of the so-called “Olympic \r\nUnity in Diversity”, with athletes from every corner \r\nof the world living together under one roof. In what is \r\nliterally a global village, the athletes get to know and \r\nunderstand each other, not just on a human level by \r\nsharing their experiences, emotions and meals. They \r\nalso share their respect for excellence, for victory and \r\nfor defeat. In that way, the Olympic athletes set an \r\nexample to the whole world that it is possible to engage \r\nin competition while at the same time live peacefully \r\ntogether.\r\nIn this Olympic spirit of peace and solidarity, the \r\nIOC, together with the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, is assisting refugees \r\nall over the world by providing activities, hope and \r\nself-confidence through sport. The Secretary-General \r\nappointed our Honorary President, Jacques Rogge, as \r\nSpecial Envoy for Youth Refugees and Sport in 2014. \r\nThe IOC is happy to support those activities financially \r\nand has created an additional fund of $2 million to \r\nbring hope to refugees through sport. At the same time, \r\nwe are assisting high-level refugee athletes to continue \r\ntheir sports careers. We help them to make their dream \r\nof sporting excellence come true, even when they have \r\nto f lee from violence and hunger. I would like to appeal \r\nto all United Nations Member States to help us to \r\nidentify such hopeful, great athletes.\r\nAt present, however, none of those athletes would \r\nhave the chance to participate in the Olympic Games, \r\neven if they qualified from the sports point of view, \r\nbecause with their refugee status they are left without \r\na home country, or a National Olympic Committee \r\nto represent them. Today, I am happy to announce \r\nbefore this meeting of the General Assembly that the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee will invite the highest \r\nqualified refugee athletes to participate in the Olympic \r\nGames in Rio de Janeiro 2016. Having no national team \r\nto belong to, having no f lag to march behind, having no \r\nnational anthem to be played for them, those refugee \r\nathletes will be welcomed to the Olympic Games with \r\nthe Olympic f lag and the Olympic anthem. They will \r\nhave a home, together with all of the other 11,000 \r\nathletes from 206 National Olympic Committees in the \r\nOlympic Village. That will be a symbol of hope for all \r\nof the refugees in the world, and will make the world \r\nbetter aware of the magnitude of the crisis.\r\nAnother wonderful example of how sport can \r\npromote peace and inclusion happened recently \r\nwith the IOC recognition of the National Olympic \r\nCommittee of South Sudan. With that recognition, we \r\nwanted to send a signal of hope to a young nation and \r\nits people — a signal of hope because sport always \r\nbuilds bridges among all peoples and all cultures. The \r\nPresident of the newly recognized National Olympic \r\nCommittee of South Sudan thanked the IOC session by \r\nsaying, “Now we will arm our young people with sport, \r\nand not with guns.” That is the spirit of the Olympic \r\nTruce that the Assembly will uphold in supporting \r\ntoday’s draft resolution.\r\nThe Olympic Games are the moment when the \r\ninternational community comes together to celebrate \r\nour common humanity. There is no doubt in my mind \r\nthat the upcoming Olympic and Paralympic Games in \r\nRio de Janeiro in 2016 will provide a spectacular stage \r\nto showcase the best of the human spirit. We can look \r\nforward together to inspiring Olympic Games.\r\nI would like to reiterate the warm-hearted \r\ninvitation to the international community to come \r\ntogether in Rio de Janeiro in 2016 extended by the \r\nOrganizing Committee, so ably led by our friend and \r\ncolleague Carlos Nuzman. Brazil and the Brazilians \r\nwill enthusiastically welcome the world and overwhelm \r\nus with their joy of life and their passion for sport. \r\nThrough the Olympic Games, the Brazilian people \r\nwill remind the world of their unique combination of \r\npassion and efficiency.\r\nHistory will speak of a Rio de Janeiro before the \r\nOlympic Games and a much better Rio de Janeiro \r\nafter the Olympic Games. Rio de Janeiro is building \r\na legacy of the Olympic Games through very concrete \r\nmeasures. Much-needed improvements to the public \r\ntransportation system and education programmes for \r\nall will benefit generations to come. The Olympic \r\nGames in Rio de Janeiro are already now a symbol for \r\nthe efforts of Brazil to build a better future for all its \r\ncitizens.\r\nThe values of tolerance, solidarity and peace are a \r\ncentral part of Rio de Janeiro’s legacy to the people of \r\nBrazil. They will showcase sport as a key tool for peace, \r\nsocial inclusion and tolerance in the fight against racial, \r\nethnic and gender discrimination.\r\nI would like to commend the efforts of Brazil, the \r\nOrganizing Committee and the Paralympic Movement \r\nto promote the rights and inclusion of persons with \r\n15-33386 19/20\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.39\r\ndisabilities at the Paralympic Games and beyond. This \r\nis another example of how sport can inspire social \r\nprogress. Still another example is the cooperation \r\nbetween the IOC and UN-Women. Our joint initiative \r\ntargets girls between the ages of 12 and 14 in schools \r\nacross the state of Rio de Janeiro. Using a series of \r\nsports programmes, we are empowering those girls to \r\nbecome future leaders.\r\nThe mission of the IOC is to put sport at the service \r\nof humankind. We are aware that we can reach this goal \r\nonly in partnership with others, which is why today we \r\nare reaffirming our strong commitment to the United \r\nNations and its Member States to work in partnership \r\ntowards making our shared goals a reality. The Olympic \r\nTruce can give hope for a better future for all. With the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s support for the draft resolution on \r\nthe Truce today, it is my hope that the Olympic Games \r\nRio de Janeiro 2016 will become synonymous with \r\nthe efforts of the international community to build a \r\npeaceful and better world for all through sport.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 12.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.3, entitled “Building a peaceful and \r\nbetter world through sport and the Olympic ideal”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should like \r\nto announce that, since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution and in addition to those delegations listed \r\nin document A/70/L.3, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Afghanistan, \r\nAlbania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Azerbaijan, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, \r\nBarbados, Belize, Benin, Bhutan, the Plurinational \r\nState of Bolivia, Botswana, Brunei Darussalam, \r\nBurundi, Cabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Chad, \r\nColombia, the Comoros, the Congo, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo, the Dominican Republic, El Salvador, \r\nEquatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gabon, the \r\nGambia, Ghana, Grenada, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, \r\nGuyana, Honduras, India, Indonesia, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, Iraq, Kiribati, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, Lebanon, Lesotho, \r\nLiberia, Libya, Liechtenstein, Madagascar, Malawi, \r\nMaldives, Mali, Mauritania, the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, Montenegro, Morocco, Namibia, Nauru, \r\nNepal, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Oman, Palau, Panama, Papua \r\nNew Guinea, Peru, the Philippines, Qatar, the Republic \r\nof Moldova, Rwanda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint \r\nLucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San \r\nMarino, Sao Tome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, \r\nSerbia, Sierra Leone, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South \r\nSudan, Sri Lanka, the Sudan, Swaziland, Sweden, the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, \r\nTurkmenistan, Uganda, the United Arab Emirates, the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, Vanuatu, Yemen, Zambia \r\nand Zimbabwe.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the Assembly to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.3?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 70/4).\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded its consideration of agenda item 12.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.20 p.m.\r\n"
