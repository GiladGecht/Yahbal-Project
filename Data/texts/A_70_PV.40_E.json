Last year, 188 Member States voted in favour of \r\nresolution 69/5 on that subject.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement has always reiterated \r\nits strongest opposition to unilateral coercive measures \r\nwith extraterritorial effect. NAM has repeatedly \r\nreiterated its call on the Government of the United States \r\nof America to put an end to its unilateral economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba, which \r\nis contrary to international law, the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the norms and principles governing \r\npeaceful relations among States. It also violates Cuba’s \r\nright to interact with the international community.\r\nThe embargo has had and continues to have \r\nextremely adverse impacts on the well-being of the \r\nCuban people. The direct and indirect damage caused \r\nby the undeserved embargo against Cuba is enormous. \r\nIt affects all crucial sectors of the economy, including \r\npublic health, nutrition and agriculture, as well as \r\nbanking, trade, investment and tourism. It denies Cuba \r\naccess to markets, development aid from international \r\nfinancial institutions and technology transfers, and it \r\ncreates impediments for the socioeconomic development \r\nof the country. The embargo is also the main obstacle \r\nto broader access to the Internet, the exchange of ideas \r\nand the development of cultural, sport and scientific \r\nrelations. The continuation of the embargo is totally \r\nunjustifiable and hampers Cuba’s efforts to achieve \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe cumulative economic damage to the Cuban \r\npeople due to the application of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade of the United States \r\nagainst Cuba, taking into account the depreciation of the \r\ndollar in relation to the price of gold on the international \r\nmarket, amounts to $833.7 billion. At current prices, \r\nover all those years the blockade has caused damages \r\nof over $121 billion.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.40\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n40th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 26 October 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nNAM considers the establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States to \r\nbe an initial positive step in the process towards the \r\nnormalization of bilateral relations. At the same time, \r\nit should be noted that the implementation of the \r\nblockade against Cuba remains unchanged. Indeed, \r\nunder the current Administration of the United \r\nStates, the blockade has been further tightened and its \r\nterritorial implementation further intensified through \r\nthe imposition of 42 fines on United States and foreign \r\nentities amounting to more than $13.2 billion, the most \r\nnotorious of which are the $1.7 billion fine imposed on \r\nthe German bank Commerzbank and the $7.6-million \r\nfine imposed on the United States company PayPal. \r\nWhile the regulations issued by the United States \r\nDepartments of Commerce and the Treasury on \r\n15 January were steps in the right direction in areas such \r\nas travel to Cuba, telecommunications and remittances, \r\nthey are limited in scope and modify only certain \r\naspects related to the implementation of the blockade.\r\nDespite the historic decision of the United States \r\nPresident to notify the United States Congress of his \r\ndecision to remove Cuba from the so-called list of State \r\nsponsors of international terrorism — a list on which \r\nCuba should have never been included — that has not \r\nmeant an easing of the intricacies of all the prohibitions \r\nand restrictions established by the blockade laws and \r\nregulations imposed against that country. For its part, \r\nthe United States Congress has not approved any of \r\nthe bills seeking to eliminate some of the blockade \r\nregulations.\r\nBased on all this, NAM upholds its call for an end \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial blockade \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba. We recall \r\nthat, last year, 188 States Members of the United \r\nNations voted in favour of the resolution on this \r\nitem. That number signifies near unanimity within \r\nthe international community in demanding an end to \r\nthe five-decade embargo and full adherence to the \r\nprinciples of mutual respect and non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of Cuba. Currently, over 190 nations \r\nengage economically and politically with Cuba, while \r\nthe United States stands alone in pursuing its unjustified \r\neconomic sanctions policy.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement once again urges the \r\nUnited States of America to yield to the will of the \r\noverwhelming majority of the international community \r\nand to rectify its failed polices by fully complying \r\nwith all General Assembly resolutions that call for an \r\nimmediate and complete end to the embargo imposed \r\non Cuba.\r\nMr. Morejón Pazmiño (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI have the special honour to address the General \r\nAssembly today on behalf of the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States (CELAC).\r\nCELAC welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States and \r\nCuba, which opens a new chapter in the history of \r\npeace and coexistence between American States. We \r\nacknowledge the intention expressed by President \r\nObama to end the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade that the United States has maintained against \r\nCuba for 56 years.\r\nHowever, the embargo remains a reality for the \r\nCuban people. It undeniably remains the primary \r\nobstacle to Cuba’s normal development. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/70/120) confirms the cost to \r\nCuba of that policy, which causes immeasurable and \r\nunjustifiable damage to the well-being of the Cuban \r\npeople. It runs counter to the desire for peace of the \r\nLatin American people, expressed in the proclamation \r\nof Latin America as a zone of peace. In our opinion, the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade imposed \r\nagainst Cuba contravenes the letter and spirit of the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and international law.\r\nCELAC reiterates its vigorous rejection of the \r\napplication of laws and measures that contradict \r\ninternational law, such as the Helms-Burton Law, \r\nincluding its extraterritorial provisions, and urges the \r\nGovernment of the United States of America to end its \r\nimplementation. The United States Congress has the \r\nauthority to completely end the blockade against Cuba. \r\nWe note the executive orders issued by President Obama \r\nas of January, including the removal of Cuba from the \r\nlist of countries that sponsor terrorism, on which it has \r\nnever belonged, which attest to broad powers of the \r\nUnited States President to modify the unjust policy of \r\nthe blockade.\r\nCELAC reiterates its special declaration on the need \r\nfor the United States to end its economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade against Cuba, adopted at the \r\nthird Summit of the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States, held in Belén, Costa Rica, on \r\n28 and 29 January, calling on the Government of the \r\nUnited States to comply with the series of resolutions \r\nadopted by the General Assembly and to respond to the \r\n15-33534 3/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nrepeated demands of the countries of Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean to end its economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade of Cuba. CELAC reiterates its grave \r\nconcern about and rejection of the intensification of \r\nthe extraterritorial dimension of the blockade and the \r\ngrowing hindrance of Cuba’s international financial \r\ntransactions, which contradict the political will of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations enshrines rights, \r\nobligations and principles that have become part of the \r\nlegal heritage not only of international law but of all \r\nhumankind, and must not be the object of violations \r\nor undermining by any Member. Member States must \r\nadapt their national legislation in accordance with \r\nthe rights, obligations and principles enshrined by \r\nour founding Charter. For those reasons, CELAC will \r\ndecisively support draft resolution A/70/L.2, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”, and commends the effort of the \r\nsister Republic of Cuba to draft language adapted to \r\ncurrent circumstances.\r\nWe stress the inconsistency between the imposition \r\nof unilateral measures that are not supported by \r\ninternational law and the letter and spirit of the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We reiterate our call on the United States to \r\naccept the call of the countries of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean and all regions of the world, as well as \r\nof its own people, to put an end once and for all to its \r\nunjust blockade of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nWith those words I close my remarks on behalf of \r\nCELAC. I will now speak in my national capacity.\r\nEcuador would like to add that it is cause for sadness \r\nto hear the Government of the United States claim to \r\nhave ended its 50-year embargo. The United States is \r\nproposing to change its 50-year blockade not because it \r\nhas violated inter-American law, international law, the \r\nrights of the Cuban people or human rights, but because \r\nthe embargo has not worked. Ecuador believes that this \r\nimplies no concession. This is about justice and the \r\ndignity of the Cuban people, who have put up 50 years \r\nof heroic resistance.\r\nOur peoples will never again accept trusteeship, \r\ninterference or intervention. Our memory is lacerated \r\nby the abuses and violence of the past, even if we are \r\nasked to forget them and look only to the future as if \r\nnothing had happened. For that reason, Ecuador will \r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution before us not only \r\nbecause it is a just cause. It is deplorable that in the \r\ntwenty-first century some continue to undermine the \r\nfounding principles of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law, and to hinder the inclusive \r\nsustainable economic development of other peoples and \r\nStates.\r\nEcuador looks forward with hope towards the \r\nrestoration of diplomatic relations between Cuba and \r\nthe United States and hopes that the process will lead \r\nto the end to the blockade and the closing of the base \r\nat Guantanamo. That will not constitute a concession \r\non the part of any Power; instead, it will represent the \r\ntriumph of justice and the dignity of the Cuban people, \r\nas expressed by the President of the Republic of Ecuador \r\nin the general debate of this session (see A/70/PV.15). \r\nWe reiterate and restate that view today.\r\nMr. Mamabolo (South Africa): Allow me to register \r\nthe following remarks on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina. I wish also to acknowledge the presence of the \r\nhonourable Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Cuba, His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China welcomes the \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between the \r\nRepublic of Cuba and the United States. In that context, \r\nwe welcome the bold initiative of President Raúl Castro \r\nand President Barack Obama. That joint initiative is a \r\nsignificant first step towards the full normalization of \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States. However, \r\nit needs to be followed by the immediate lifting of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States against Cuba. Since it has been \r\namply recognized that the blockade is harmful to the \r\nCuban people, it is high time for the Congress of the \r\nUnited States to put an end to the embargo. The Group \r\nof 77 and China supports Cuba’s decision to embrace \r\nthis rapprochement, despite the illegal nature of the \r\nimposition of the blockade and the immense human and \r\neconomic suffering and hardship endured by the Cuban \r\npeople for over 50 years.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China is of the view that, \r\nalthough President Obama performed an act of historical \r\njustice when he notified the United States Congress of \r\nhis decision to remove Cuba from the list of so-called \r\nState sponsors of international terrorism — a list on \r\nwhich Cuba should have never been included in the \r\nfirst place — that has not meant an easing of all of the \r\nprohibitions and restrictions established by the blockade \r\nlaws and regulations imposed against that sister \r\n4/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\ncountry. It is disheartening to note that the United States \r\nCongress has not approved any of the bills seeking to \r\neliminate some of the remaining blockade regulations. \r\nHowever, so far, 10 legal initiatives have been presented \r\nin Congress to reinforce several fundamental aspects \r\nrelated to the implementation of that policy and to \r\nprevent the approval by President Obama of new \r\nexecutive measures and the implementation of those \r\nalready adopted.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China would like to submit \r\nthat, following 17 December 2014, the implementation \r\nof the blockade against Cuba has remained unchanged. \r\nThe most notorious proof of that fact are the $1.71 billion \r\nfine imposed on the German bank Commerzbank and the \r\n$7,658,300 fine imposed on the United States company \r\nPayPal. Despite some of the positive overtures that have \r\nbeen extended to date by Washington, D.C., it remains \r\na cause for concern that, under the Administration \r\nof President Obama, the blockade has been further \r\ntightened and its territorial implementation and grip \r\nintensified through the imposition of 42 fines on United \r\nStates and foreign entities totalling $13,279,148,196.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China joins the international \r\ncommunity in condemning the unilateral blockade of \r\nCuba and calls on the United States to initiate measures \r\nto immediately repeal those inhumane actions designed \r\nto illicitly punish a nation. Such measures are contrary \r\nto the principles, purposes and spirit of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, especially the principle of the \r\nsovereign equality of States and non-intervention in \r\nthe domestic affairs of Member States. The severe \r\neconomic and financial restrictions that stif le the \r\neconomic and social development of Cuba further \r\nexacerbate the hardships and suffering of the people of \r\nCuba. That must come to an end.\r\nThe Group reiterates its unconditional support \r\nfor the implementation of the recommendations of \r\nresolution 69/5 and takes this opportunity to appeal \r\nonce again to the international community to redouble \r\nits efforts to promote constructive and transparent \r\ndialogue between the two countries, with a view to \r\nachieving the objectives of all the resolutions already \r\nadopted by the United Nations on the matter and to \r\nensure the sustainable and further progress of the \r\npeople of Cuba.\r\nWhile the regulations issued by the United \r\nStates Departments of Commerce and the Treasury \r\non 15 January were steps in the right direction in \r\nareas such as travel to Cuba, telecommunications \r\nand remittances, those measures are limited in scope \r\nand will address only the tip of the iceberg. More \r\ncommitments are therefore needed. We must also \r\ndenounce the constraints placed on Cuba’s right to \r\ncarry out financial transactions abroad. All countries \r\ndeserve to be allowed to do business in an open and just \r\nenvironment, which is a sovereign right that needs to \r\nbe recognized.\r\nDespite the difficulties that Cuba has experienced \r\ndue to the economic, commercial and financial embargo, \r\nthat country, in demonstration of its international \r\nsolidarity, has consistently supplied medical assistance \r\nof the highest quality at the international level. More \r\nthan 50,000 health workers trained in Cuba are \r\nproviding services in 66 countries, including in Sierra \r\nLeone, on the front lines of the Ebola crisis.\r\nThroughout all these years, the embargo and \r\nblockade have caused damages estimated at more than \r\n$121.19 billion. Therefore, in conclusion, the Group of \r\n77 and China reiterates yet again its call for the embargo \r\nand blockade against Cuba to cease. It is the most \r\nunjust, severe and longest-lasting system of unilateral \r\nsanctions ever applied to any country. Failure to do so \r\nwould cause history to judge harshly the players that are \r\ncontinuing to perpetuate the aforementioned system. \r\nThis historical injunction remains ever more relevant \r\nand timely as we move towards the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1). We also need to make a commitment \r\nin this forum not to leave the Cuban people behind.\r\nMr. Minah (Sierra Leone): It is indeed an honour \r\nfor me to speak on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates on draft resolution A/70/L.2, entitled “Necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”.\r\nAt the outset, the African Group welcomes the \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba, which we view as a significant \r\nstep in fostering closer bilateral ties between the two \r\nnations. While noting such positive achievements, \r\nthe Group continues to reaffirm its condemnation of \r\nthe ongoing economic and financial embargo against \r\nCuba. We note that it has been over 50 years since those \r\ncrippling sanctions were imposed and that it has been \r\ntwo decades since this item was first placed on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly.\r\n15-33534 5/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nThe African Group is aware that the economic \r\nsanctions continue to cause great economic hardship \r\nfor the people of Cuba, particularly the poor and \r\nmost vulnerable. We call for an immediate end to the \r\neconomic embargo and reaffirm that it is imperative \r\nfor the promotion of better standards of living for the \r\npeople of Cuba, particularly in view of the theme of \r\n“leaving no one behind”, as enshrined in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). \r\nWe encourage and fully endorse the ongoing spirit of \r\ndialogue that continues between Cuba and the United \r\nStates, aimed at resolving all outstanding issues \r\nbetween the two nations. While reaffirming our full \r\nsupport for the draft resolution that we have gathered \r\ntoday to consider, we continue to reiterate our call on \r\nthe Government of the United States to lift the long-\r\nstanding embargo against Cuba.\r\nSpeaking in my national capacity, on this day in \r\nthis Hall, let me say that Sierra Leone adds its voice \r\nto all of those who call for a new beginning and a new \r\nchapter in the relationship between the two States \r\ninvolved. In particular, Sierra Leone joins its voice with \r\nall those asking that the shackles of the past be cut and \r\nthe promise of a truly diplomatically and economically \r\nliberated Cuba be allowed to stand. Beyond consensus, \r\nbeyond majority and by near unanimity, the Assembly \r\nhas called for a lifting of the embargo and this year, \r\nSierra Leone believes that we will stand on the right side \r\nof history and make that call loudly and emphatically.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait): I have the honour to make \r\nthis statement on behalf of the States members of the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\r\nAt the outset, the States members of the OIC \r\nwelcome the significant step of the restoration of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the Governments of the \r\nUnited States and Cuba, and the importance of that \r\nstep in furthering the normalization of the bilateral ties \r\nbetween both nations. Nevertheless, and in spite of the \r\naforementioned positive step, the issue of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba remains. Such unilateral \r\naction taken by the United States has done harm not \r\nonly to the Cuban economy, but also to the well-being \r\nof the Cuban people and Cuban nationals living abroad, \r\nthereby creating unnecessary economic hardship for \r\nthem.\r\nFurthermore, the decades-long embargo has \r\nimpeded socioeconomic and development progress. \r\nIn addition, the unilateral blockade affects not only \r\nCuba, but also extends to third countries, and entities \r\nand companies that face imposed fines for engaging in \r\ncommercial activity with Cuba. The OIC believes that \r\nsuch unilateral actions run counter to the principles \r\nand purposes of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nOIC reiterates its deep concern regarding the negative \r\nimpact of the unilateral blockade on the Cuban people \r\nand believes that the continuation of the embargo is \r\nunjustifiable and hinders Cuban efforts to achieve \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe OIC recalls that the text before us has, over the \r\npast few years, garnered the overwhelming support of \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations. Continuing \r\nto disregard the international community’s collective \r\nwill weakens multilateralism and undermines the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations. The OIC supports \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.2 and calls upon the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to vote in favour of it.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): I have the honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the 14 States \r\nmembers of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM). \r\nCARICOM aligns itself with the statements made on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States.\r\nThe Caribbean Community continues to reiterate \r\nits unequivocal opposition to the United States’ \r\nimposition of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba, which has been opposed by the \r\noverwhelming majority of the international community \r\nfor the past 23 consecutive years. The unilateral \r\nimposition of extraterritorial laws on third States is \r\ncontrary to both the letter and the spirit of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, and the embargo itself runs counter \r\nto the principles of multilateralism, international law, \r\nsovereignty and free trade that this body consistently \r\nchampions.\r\nThe punitive embargo is of particular concern \r\nto CARICOM, which shares a history, culture and \r\nbrotherhood with the people of Cuba. Cuba is the most \r\npopulous State of the Caribbean region and an integral \r\npart of the Pan-Caribbean process. Caribbean ties with \r\nCuba have historical significance, cemented by years of \r\nactive cooperation at various levels. The States members \r\nof CARICOM continue to maintain close relations \r\nwith Cuba through a wide range of programmes of \r\ncooperation in areas including trade, health care, \r\ninfrastructure and human resource development. Our \r\nfuture regional development is in many ways reliant \r\n6/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nupon our collective advancement and progress. In that \r\ncontext, we view the embargo as not only a punitive \r\nact against Cuba, but as an impediment to our shared \r\nregional development.\r\nCARICOM welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates. We believe that this is an important positive step \r\nin the process towards the normalization of bilateral \r\nrelations between the two States. We also applaud \r\nPresident Barack Obama’s expressed intention to open \r\na new chapter in the relations between both nations. \r\nWe commend him for recognizing that the blockade is \r\nharmful to the Cuban people and for urging the United \r\nStates Congress to put an end to the punitive policy.\r\nWhile the regulations issued by the Departments of \r\nCommerce and the Treasury on 15 January concerning \r\ntravel to Cuba, telecommunications and remittances \r\nare steps pointing in the right direction, they are \r\nstill limited in scope and only modify some aspects \r\nrelated to the implementation of the blockade. We \r\nremain guardedly optimistic that the recent overtures \r\nmade by the United States will be complemented by \r\nan increased willingness to consider the opinions and \r\nconcerns of its international friends and partners. On \r\nthat issue, global opinion could hardly be conveyed in \r\na more convincing or consistent manner. Our welcome \r\nof the recent pronouncements and actions of the United \r\nStates Government carries with it the expectation \r\nthat the remaining historical wrongs will be righted \r\nexpeditiously.\r\nCARICOM reiterates its support for the right of \r\nthe Cuban people to self-determination in a manner \r\nbeneficial to their social and economic development. \r\nIndeed, Cuba’s peaceful, generous and cooperative \r\ninternational stance merits nothing less. We therefore \r\ncall once more for an end to the embargo, which has \r\npreserved a state of tension between two neighbouring \r\ncountries and generated great concern and widespread \r\nunease throughout our subregion.\r\nCARICOM continues to enjoy friendly relations \r\nwith both Cuba and the United States. Our two \r\nneighbours — a mere 90 miles apart — have produced \r\ngreat scholars, scientists and global leaders. They \r\npossess proud and noble histories and are populated by \r\nfriendly, open and loving peoples. Recent developments \r\nhave renewed our hope for the full normalization of \r\nCuba-United States relations. However, we consider \r\nthe lifting of the embargo to be a prerequisite for any \r\nmeaningful rapprochement. It is within this context that \r\nCARICOM States declare our unstinting support for \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.2 on the necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba.\r\nMr. Scappini Ricciardi (Paraguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I am honoured to speak in this debate on \r\nbehalf of the States members of the Southern Common \r\nMarket (MERCOSUR) and associated States. At the \r\noutset, I wish to extend a warm welcome to Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, and his delegation.\r\nLike many States represented here, MERCOSUR \r\nand its associated States, having closely followed \r\nregional and international political developments, \r\nwelcome the re-establishment of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States of America, and \r\ncannot but recognize that they represent a positive \r\ninitial first step towards the normalization of relations, \r\nleading to greater stability in Latin America and the \r\nworld. MERCOSUR congratulates both parties on \r\ntheir bold initiative. However, nine months after the \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between the \r\ntwo States, the embargo imposed unilaterally by the \r\nUnited States of America continues to incur significant \r\nhumanitarian and economic costs that prevent the \r\nnormal development of Cuba.\r\nSince the signing of the Treaty of Asunción, \r\nMERCOSUR has continued to defend the principles \r\nof respect for sovereignty and good-neighbourliness \r\nand rejected unilateral, extraterritorial and coercive \r\nmeasures, which in this particular case have caused \r\nirreparable damage to Cuba and its people. In that \r\nlight, MERCOSUR considers that the economic, \r\ntrade and financial blockade constitutes a violation \r\nof the principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe norms of international law, non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in internal affairs, the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and freedom of international \r\ntrade and navigation.\r\nMERCOSUR and its associated States reaffirm \r\ntheir commitment to multilateralism as a legitimate tool \r\nin resolving disputes and an effective way to promote \r\ninternational cooperation and understanding among \r\npeoples. We believe, now more than ever, that in this \r\nnew context, the time has come to put an end to the \r\nunilateral embargo.\r\nIn conclusion, MERCOSUR again supports and \r\nendorses the draft resolution entitled “Necessity \r\n15-33534 7/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”, which has been submitted for the twenty-\r\nfourth consecutive time to the General Assembly, and \r\nurges all Member States to vote for it.\r\nMr. Ibrahim (Malaysia): I have the honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly on behalf of the 10 States \r\nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN): Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, the \r\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my \r\nown country, Malaysia.\r\nWe express our support for draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.2, on ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against the Republic of Cuba. ASEAN aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and that made by the representative of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nSince this text was first introduced in 1992, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has consistently adopted it by an \r\noverwhelming majority. ASEAN member States have \r\nvoted unanimously in favour of the resolution for the \r\npast 14 years. It is our firm belief that differences \r\nbetween States should be settled through engagement, \r\nnot confrontation; by inclusion, not isolation; and in \r\naccordance with the fundamental principles of sovereign \r\nequality, non-interference and non-intervention as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn that regard, ASEAN welcomes the restoration \r\nof diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates. We also welcome the lifting of a number of \r\nrestrictions on travel and remittances by the United \r\nStates since 16 January. Those are important first \r\nsteps toward the normalization of bilateral relations, \r\nand have been rightly hailed as key to better regional \r\nrelations in the Americas. We believe that this positive \r\nmove will be mutually beneficial to the peoples of both \r\ncountries and contribute to peace, security and stability \r\nand enhanced cooperation in the region.\r\nGoing forward, an even more important step will be \r\nfor the United States to end its economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo on Cuba. This would significantly \r\nimprove the quality of life and living standards of the \r\nCuban people and contribute to the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of Cuba. Ending the embargo would also \r\nadvance the Assembly’s efforts towards achieving an \r\ninclusive post-2015 development agenda.\r\nASEAN strongly urges the United States and Cuba \r\nto take this opportunity to chart a new way forward. We \r\nrecognize that much remains to be done. We encourage \r\nthe United States and Cuba to commit to open and \r\nconstructive dialogue, without preconditions and \r\nunderpinned by mutual respect. ASEAN joins the other \r\nmembers of the Assembly in reiterating our strong \r\nsupport for the lifting of the unilateral embargo against \r\nCuba as soon as possible.\r\nMr. Montaño (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): Once \r\nagain, Mexico rejects the unilateral measures against \r\nthe Republic of Cuba, including the imposition for \r\nmore than 50 years of an economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo that runs counter to international \r\nlaw and relations among States. We firmly believe that \r\nmultilateralism is and will continue to be the best way \r\nto resolve disputes and to ensure peaceful coexistence \r\namong States.\r\nAs we have done in previous years, today we \r\nreiterate that the only organs that can impose political, \r\nmilitary or economic sanctions are the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly. No State should use force to \r\nimpose unilateral measures that affect the development \r\nand prosperity of other peoples. About a year ago, in \r\nVeracruz, Mexico, the Heads of State and Government \r\nof the Ibero-American Community of Nations reiterated \r\ntheir vigorous rejection of laws and measures that run \r\ncounter to international law, and urged the Government \r\nof the United States to comply with the 23 resolutions \r\nadopted by the General Assembly with a view to ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba. The third Summit of \r\nHeads of State and Government of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States issued a similar \r\ndeclaration urging the President of the United States to \r\nuse the powers granted him by the Constitution to make \r\nsignificant changes to the way in which the embargo is \r\nbeing imposed.\r\nWe recognize that each State is free and sovereign. \r\nIn line with the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, we must respect the self-determination of \r\nthe peoples of the world. Sustainable development for \r\nall peoples must be given priority over economic and \r\npolitical interests. We therefore welcome the measures \r\ntaken by the Cuban Government to meet its international \r\ncommitments in the area of development, which will \r\n8/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nbenefit its people. In spite of the adverse circumstances \r\nit has faced for over 50 years, the Republic of Cuba \r\nhas attained high levels of human development. Cuba \r\nwill no doubt be a strategic partner in implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), which will help to build fairer and more equitable \r\nsocieties in Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nMexico welcomes the re-establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States of America, \r\nwhich will lead to the full normalization of relations \r\nbetween the two neighbouring and friendly countries. \r\nWe firmly believe that a renewed relationship between \r\nthe two countries will also help to decisively strengthen \r\ndialogue and cooperation among all of the nations of the \r\nhemisphere. As part of this process, Mexico believes \r\nthat ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba would help to shift and improve \r\nits economy and ensure its full reintegration and access \r\nto financial f lows and international investment that \r\nwould indisputably benefit our region.\r\nMexico recognizes and supports the process of \r\nupdating Cuba’s economic and social model, which will \r\nallow us to support each other when needed. The visit to \r\nHavana this month by our Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nClaudia Ruiz Massieu, shows that both countries are \r\ninterested in strengthening dialogue and cooperation \r\nand deepening bilateral relations. The Government of \r\nMexico is consolidating its political and trade relations \r\nwith Cuba in an effort to strengthen the economic \r\ncomplementary agreement.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to underscore that Mexico \r\nhas always maintained brotherly bonds of friendship, \r\nsolidarity and respect with the people of Cuba, and we \r\nonce again reiterate our support for the draft resolution \r\nsubmitted for consideration by the General Assembly.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nColombia eagerly endorses the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China, Ecuador on behalf of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, and Paraguay \r\non behalf of the Southern Common Market. I welcome \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and his delegation to the \r\nGeneral Assembly today.\r\nLike others who have spoken today, we wish to \r\nhighlight the process leading towards the normalization \r\nof bilateral relations between Cuba and the United States \r\nof America. When the President of Colombia, Juan \r\nManuel Santos Calderón, visited New York last year, he \r\nsaid that he had faith that the United States and Cuba \r\ncould achieve a working relationship that would enable \r\nthe United States to lift the embargo. That is why my \r\ncountry welcomes the re-establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations between the two countries and is optimistic \r\nabout the willingness expressed by President Obama to \r\nend the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. We firmly believe that such political will \r\nwill serve as a basis to make this a reality that would \r\nbenefit the people of that sister Latin American nation.\r\nSince resolution 47/19 was adopted on 24 November \r\n1992, my Government, like all Governments of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean and the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the States Members of the Organization, has \r\nexpressed its support for Cuba and voted in favour of \r\nthe resolutions on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba. The 188 votes \r\ncast in favour of resolution 69/5 reflect the support and \r\nsolidarity of Member States and reaffirm the need to \r\nend a policy that has lasted for more than 50 years. My \r\ncountry believes, as we have said on previous occasions, \r\nthat the embargo runs counter to international law and \r\nthe spirit and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nIn line with the resolution, my country reaffirms \r\nits policy of respect for international law and \r\nadherence to the principles of political independence, \r\nthe self-determination of peoples, non-intervention \r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of other \r\nnations. Consequently, Colombia does not support \r\nsuch measures, which run counter to the economic \r\nand commercial development and the welfare of the \r\npopulation. My country considers it indispensable \r\nthat Member States make progress in building links of \r\ncooperation and friendship based on multilateralism \r\nand the principle of sovereign equality, enshrined in \r\nChapter I of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMrs. Nguyen Phuong Nga (Viet Nam): At the \r\noutset, I would to like to extend my warmest welcome \r\nto Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba.\r\nViet Nam endorses the statements made earlier \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group \r\nof 77 and China and the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations. We thank the Secretary-General for the \r\ncomprehensive report (A/70/120), which lays out the \r\n15-33534 9/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nposition of Member States on ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by \r\nthe United States of America against Cuba and the \r\nassessments by United Nations agencies of the impact \r\nof the embargo.\r\nSince the adoption of resolution 47/19, on \r\n24 November 1992, the General Assembly has \r\nrepeatedly adopted resolutions calling upon the United \r\nStates of America to end its economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba, the most recent of \r\nwhich is resolution 69/5, adopted on 28 October 2014 \r\nby 188 votes in favour. Viet Nam’s principled position \r\nopposes the imposition of any unilateral embargo and \r\ncoercive measures by one State on another, and today \r\nwe will vote unreservedly in favour of draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.2 in its entirety.\r\nThrough its vote, Viet Nam wishes to reiterate its \r\nfirm conviction that the United States of America’s \r\nblockade against Cuba for more than five decades is \r\ncontrary to international law and the fundamental \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ncauses untold hardship for the Cuban people. That \r\npolicy runs counter to the common desire of all nations \r\nin the world to build sound and equal international \r\nrelations, regardless of their political systems and based \r\non respect for each nation’s rights to choose its own \r\npath of development. Viet Nam joins other members \r\nof the Assembly in calling for the immediate lifting of \r\nthe unjustified unilateral economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), which our leaders adopted one month \r\nago, has established a new paradigm for development, \r\ncooperation and solidarity among the peoples of the \r\nworld. However, that ambitious Agenda will not be \r\nrealized if the fundamental freedoms and rights of \r\nStates Members of the United Nations are still being \r\ndisregarded.\r\nViet Nam welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America. We are encouraged by the United \r\nStates President’s explicit intention to open a new \r\nchapter in relations with Cuba, urging the United \r\nStates Congress to lift the blockade. We hope that this \r\nimportant historic opportunity will not be missed. \r\nThe continuation of the blockade against Cuba poses \r\nan essential obstacle to the normalization of relations \r\nbetween the two countries. Lifting the embargo would \r\nbe beneficial for the people of both Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America, as well as for peace, stability and \r\nprosperity in the region and the world.\r\nDespite the detrimental repercussions of the \r\nembargo, Cuba has overcome difficulties and made \r\nimportant contributions to the common efforts of the \r\ninternational community to address global challenges. \r\nMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nViet Nam’s friendship, cooperation and solidarity with \r\nCuba. We will continue to do our utmost to help the \r\nfraternal people of Cuba to overcome difficulties and \r\nchallenges caused by the embargo.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt): Let me start by welcoming \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba, and assure him of Egypt’s continued \r\nsupport and solidarity with the Government and people \r\nof Cuba.\r\nEgypt welcomes the establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica, and welcomes the United States President’s \r\nwillingness to work to lift the blockade imposed on \r\nCuba for more than five decades. We also recognize \r\nthe advancements made in the regulations issued by \r\nthe Government of the United States of America in \r\nsome areas. We hope that those steps will lead to the \r\nnormalization of bilateral relations in all their aspects \r\nbetween the two countries.\r\nHowever, while that progress constitutes a step \r\nin the right direction, it remains insufficient, as the \r\nimposition of the blockade has remained unchanged, \r\nand the laws and regulations underpinning it continue \r\nto be in force and implemented with the utmost severity. \r\nWe still believe that the United States of America \r\nneeds to take many steps and brave decisions towards \r\nthe immediate lifting of the embargo imposed against \r\nCuba for the full normalization of their relations. For \r\nfive decades, the United States of America has imposed \r\nstringent restrictions on the Cuban people’s access \r\nto food, medicines, education and high-technology \r\ngoods. The embargo has had detrimental repercussions \r\non many sectors of the Cuban economy, generating \r\nunnecessary shortages and suffering for the Cuban \r\npeople.\r\nWe believe that the embargo continues to be an \r\nabsurd and morally insupportable policy, which has \r\nnot served the purpose of breaking the Cuban people’s \r\ndetermination to control their own future. Despite all \r\nthe detrimental repercussions and adverse impacts \r\nof the embargo, the Government of Cuba has made \r\n10/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nenormous efforts to meet the needs of its people. \r\nThe more than 54 years of the embargo against Cuba \r\nhave proved that, in this globalized world, the Cuban \r\npeople can still survive, thanks to their perseverance, \r\nresistance and hope.\r\nFinally, Egypt hopes that the dialogue between the \r\ntwo countries, based on mutual respect and observance \r\nof the principles of international law and the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, will lead to the immediate lifting of \r\nthe embargo and normalization of the bilateral relations \r\nin all its aspects. In the current new context, we once \r\nagain urge the United States of America to avail itself \r\nof this historic opportunity and immediately and fully \r\ncomply with all 23 General Assembly resolutions on \r\nthe subject, which were adopted by the overwhelming \r\nmajority of the international community, and lift the \r\nunjustified embargo, which should never have existed \r\nand must cease once and for all. Egypt will continue its \r\nfull support and solidarity with the Government and the \r\npeople of Cuba.\r\nMr. Ramírez Carreño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): The Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela endorses the statements delivered by the \r\nrepresentatives of Ecuador, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran and South Africa on behalf of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and the Group of 77 plus China respectively.\r\nThe embargo imposed against Cuba by the United \r\nStates of America represents a system of unilateral \r\nsanctions that is the most unjust, severe and long-\r\nlasting embargo ever imposed against any country \r\nin modern history. It has inflicted a massive human \r\ncost on the Cuban population. It is also a f lagrant \r\nviolation of the principles of respect for sovereignty \r\nand non-interference in the internal affairs of States \r\nand the rights to self-determination and development \r\nof peoples.\r\nThe brutal blockade of Cuba was basically designed \r\nto break the Cuban people’s determination to build a free \r\nand sovereign homeland. In addition to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade, the sanctions \r\nsystem against Cuba has included a set of successive \r\nprohibitions and unilateral coercive measures that \r\nhave had a cumulative impact on our Cuban brothers \r\nover more than 50 years and have resulted in economic \r\nlosses totalling more than $830 million. The sanctions \r\nalso affect any organization or country, of which we are \r\none, that attempts to maintain fraternal and cooperative \r\nrelations — economic, technological, commercial \r\nor financial — with our sister republic of Cuba. The \r\nembargo on Cuba is, therefore, an effort not only to \r\ndamage its people’s development but also to isolate \r\nthem. The vote here today in the Assembly on draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.2, the text of which will undoubtedly \r\nbe adopted for the twenty-fourth time, will once again \r\nconfirm not only that the United States has failed in its \r\nattempt to isolate Cuba, but that it is the United States \r\nAdministration that has completely isolated itself \r\nthrough its own policy.\r\nConversely, today’s adoption of the draft resolution \r\nwill send a clear, strong message to the United States \r\nthat not only should it end the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo that it has imposed on Cuba, but \r\nit should also cease its long-term practice of claiming to \r\nbe the world’s policeman and imposing its political and \r\neconomic decisions and visions on the rest of the world \r\nextraterritorially, in violation of international law and \r\nof respect for other countries’ sovereignty. The United \r\nStates economic sanctions on Cuba are reprehensible, \r\nboth because they are illegal under international law \r\nand because they are examples of the punitive measures \r\nthat the United States often imposes in response to \r\npressures and interests from extremist groups outside \r\nits own political system.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela commends \r\nthe atmosphere of dialogue that has led to the restoration \r\nof bilateral relations between the Governments of Cuba \r\nand the United States of America, and we would like \r\nto highlight President Obama’s acknowledgement \r\nthat the sanctions policy has failed every American \r\nGovernment for more than 50 years. We should add \r\nthat the sanctions policy has not only been a failure for \r\nthe United States Government, but it has also led to an \r\nextraordinary political and moral victory for the Cuban \r\npeople in their resistance and steadfastness.\r\nWe would also like to emphasize that, if the United \r\nStates Government wishes to maintain cooperative, \r\nfriendly relations with the rest of the world, and with \r\nour region of Latin America and the Caribbean in \r\nparticular, it should stop interfering in our internal \r\naffairs, stop imposing sanctions as it has done for \r\n50 years to Cuba and is now doing to the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela, and stop attempting to impose \r\nits own political and economic ideas on others. Our \r\nrelations must be based on respect for our peoples’ self-\r\ndetermination and sovereignty.\r\nWe would like today’s draft resolution, aimed \r\nat ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\n15-33534 11/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nblockade of Cuba and certain to be adopted by an \r\noverwhelming majority in the Assembly today, to \r\nfunction as an instrument reflecting what is right and \r\nthe need to enforce international law that will contribute \r\nto ensuring that the United States Congress abolishes \r\nall of its coercive measures linked to the economic \r\nblockade of Cuba, such as the 1992 Cuban Democracy \r\nAct and the 1996 Cuban Liberty and Democratic \r\nSolidarity Act, and that the United States finally learns \r\nthe lesson that its national legislature does not have the \r\npower to legislate against the world.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela will vote in \r\nfavour of the draft resolution out of the conviction and \r\ndetermination that the Cuban embargo has been a huge \r\ninjustice and offence against the law that must end once \r\nand for all.\r\nFinally, we would like to welcome the presence \r\nhere today of Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Cuba’s \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs, and through him send \r\na message in the spirit of Chávez and Bolívar to the \r\nentire Cuban people and to former President Fidel \r\nCastro and President Raúl Castro, a message of \r\nsolidarity, recognition, brotherhood and friendship, in \r\nthe confidence that victory is ours. We shall overcome!\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): India associates itself with \r\nthe statements delivered earlier by the representatives \r\nof South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and of \r\nIran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. We also \r\nwelcome Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, to the Assembly today.\r\nAt the outset, I would first like to recall that today’s \r\ndebate is taking place in the context of some welcome \r\ndevelopments in the bilateral relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States. In that context, I would like \r\nto stress that India warmly welcomes the restoration \r\nof diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates. We congratulate the Governments and the \r\npeoples of both nations on that historic event.\r\nEvery year, for more than two decades now, \r\nthe General Assembly has considered the issue of \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States on Cuba. Each time, it \r\nhas consistently rejected the imposition of laws and \r\nregulations with extraterritorial impact and all other \r\nforms of coercive economic measures that hurt the \r\nprogress and prosperity of people all over the world. \r\nThe Assembly has also called on States, in conformity \r\nwith their obligations under the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law, to refrain from \r\npromulgating and applying, and to repeal and invalidate, \r\nany laws and measures that have extraterritorial effects \r\nthat impinge on the sovereignty of other States. There \r\ncan be little doubt that the continued existence of this \r\nembargo in opposition to world opinion, as expressed \r\nby the Assembly, undermines multilateralism and the \r\ncredibility of the United Nations itself.\r\nAs the world’s largest democracy, with an abiding \r\nfaith in multilateralism, India stands in solidarity \r\nwith the international community in its unambiguous \r\nrejection of domestic laws with extraterritorial impact. \r\nEmbargoes on a country are an obstacle to the full \r\nability of its people, particularly children and women, \r\nto achieve economic and social development. They also \r\nhinder their full enjoyment of human rights, including, \r\namong other things, the right to development, food, \r\nmedical care and social services.\r\nSuccessive reports of the Secretary-General — and \r\nthis year’s report (A/70/120) is no exception — have \r\nestablished that the United States embargo on Cuba, \r\nparticularly through its extraterritorial effects, has \r\nadversely affected the Cuban people and their country’s \r\ndevelopment efforts. It has also had a negative impact \r\non the Cuban economy, which has been forced to \r\nbear considerable extra costs in sourcing products, \r\ntechnology and services, and it has discouraged \r\ninvestment and technology collaboration between \r\nCuba and third countries. In that context, we would \r\nlike to acknowledge the Cuban people’s notable \r\nsocioeconomic and development achievements, in \r\nparticular Cuba’s high Human Development Index \r\nranking and its achievement of several Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals ahead of schedule, despite the \r\ndifficult conditions that the embargo has imposed on it. \r\nCuba’s acknowledged expertise in health care, achieved \r\ndespite those conditions, enabled it to respond quickly, \r\neffectively and substantively to the Assembly’s call on \r\nall nations to respond to the Ebola crisis in Africa. In \r\nthat context, the embargo is very ironic.\r\nWhile launching the transformative 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), world \r\nleaders have once again strongly urged all States to \r\nrefrain from promulgating and applying any unilateral \r\neconomic, financial or trade measures not in accordance \r\nwith international law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations. In view of that consensus on the part of world \r\nleaders, the international community should redouble \r\nits efforts to promote an environment free from \r\n12/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nsanctions and embargoes. In that context, and logically, \r\nIndia hopes that the recent positive developments in \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States will lead \r\nto a speedy end to the embargo. Until then, we support \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.2, submitted by Cuba, and wish \r\nour brothers in Cuba every success.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria): First of all, I warmly \r\nwelcome His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and wish to \r\nconvey through him the greetings of the people and the \r\nGovernment of Algeria to our sisters and brothers in \r\nCuba.\r\nAlgeria aligns itself with the statements delivered \r\nearlier by the representative of South Africa on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China, by the representative of \r\nIran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, by the \r\nrepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States and by the representative of Kuwait \r\non behalf of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. \r\nWe also support the statements delivered earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of Jamaica on behalf of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity and by the representative of Paraguay on \r\nbehalf of the Southern Common Market.\r\nAlgeria reiterates its stand concerning the continuing \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nunilaterally imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba for more than a half-century. The \r\nconsecutive annual adoption by an overwhelming \r\nmajority of the members of the General Assembly \r\nof a draft resolution calling for the lifting of the \r\nembargo against Cuba reflects the strong desire of the \r\ninternational community to put an end to that situation. \r\nLet me recall that Algeria has always stressed that \r\nCuba, like all other Member States, has the right to \r\nfreedom of trade and navigation and to expand trade \r\non a mutually agreed-upon basis with any economic \r\npartner. Algeria has also fully shared the position that \r\nhas regularly rejected the imposition of unilateral acts or \r\nextraterritorial regulations impeding the development \r\nof any country and all forms of coercive economic \r\nand trade measures. That position reflects the abiding \r\nprinciples of Algerian foreign policy.\r\nI would like to stress that a year ago, Algeria \r\nwelcomed the courageous and bold involvement of \r\nCuban doctors in the global fight against the Ebola \r\nepidemic. We thought that it was the right move and \r\nexample to follow, as well as an inspiration for the kind \r\nof standard relationship that we all strive for and benefit \r\nfrom. We were very happy to learn that all those who \r\nwanted to create the current more positive atmosphere \r\nhave supported that remarkable move. In that regard, I \r\nwould like to conclude by welcoming the resumption \r\nof diplomatic relations between the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba, and we see as extremely positive \r\nsigns other measures and actions taken recently that \r\nwill ultimately pave the way for a full normalization \r\nof relations.\r\nMr. Beck (Solomon Islands): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of my Pacific neighbour \r\nNauru and my own country, Solomon Islands, on agenda \r\nitem 42, in relation to draft resolution A/70/L.2, calling \r\nfor the lifting of the 53-year-old economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba.\r\nSeventy years ago, States made a solemn \r\ncommitment to stand up for the equal rights of big and \r\nsmall States. We ask our friend and partner, the United \r\nStates of America, to maintain an open policy and \r\nembrace trust and confidence in restoring the rights of \r\nCuba and its people that have been denied them by the \r\nblockade. Let us observe the principles and purposes of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the provisions of \r\ninternational law to promote good-neighbourly relations \r\nand make it possible for the Cuban population to freely \r\npractice their political and economic system. We must \r\nrecognize Cuba’s convictions, principles and values, \r\nwhich govern its progress and prosperity. We should \r\nallow the Cuban population to enjoy the same quality \r\nof life as all its neighbours. Only last month, leaders \r\nof the world adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution/70/1). Our new Agenda \r\ncalls for a genuine and durable partnership, a new \r\npolitical relationship and a new form of international \r\ncooperation, so that we can meaningfully transform our \r\nworld.\r\nEvery year, the Assembly adopts, by an \r\noverwhelming majority, a draft resolution that seeks \r\nto protect commercial freedom, economic rights \r\nand financial justice for the Cuban people. This is \r\nthe twenty-fourth year that the General Assembly is \r\ndealing with a more than five-decades-old issue that \r\nhas seen 11 United States Presidents and three Cuban \r\nPresidents. Given those facts, optimism and change \r\nare, nevertheless, in the air. There is a new dawn \r\nbreaking in Cuban and American relations, which \r\nNauru and Solomon Islands join all in welcoming. The \r\nrapprochement of the two Governments is a welcome \r\ndevelopment. The restoration of diplomatic relations \r\n15-33534 13/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nthis year between the two countries is an essential \r\nstep towards re-establishing full respect and civility \r\nbetween the two close neighbours, which are set 90 \r\nmiles apart from one another geographically.\r\nIt must be noted that the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial blockade by the United States on Cuba remains \r\nin place, although incremental changes are slowly \r\ntaking place. The United States has an opportunity to \r\nbreak with the past and better understand its neighbour, \r\nCuba. The United States of America must continue to \r\nput in place policies that allow for the full integration of \r\nCuba into the global system and eliminate obstacles that \r\nhamper cooperation. Allow me to suggest normalizing \r\nrelations by having the United States of America’s \r\nlegislative branch repeal laws that have been used to \r\nenforce the embargo.\r\nWhen the United States and Cuba cooperate, \r\nthe whole world stands to benefit. As others before \r\nme have stated, we have witnessed that fact in the \r\nfight against Ebola, and we know that the world will \r\nbenefit if the blockade is lifted. Let us have faith in \r\nour people working together to free themselves from \r\nfear and want and to live in dignity. On this occasion, \r\nthe Governments and the people of Nauru and Solomon \r\nIslands would like to thank the Government and the \r\npeople of Cuba for the medical scholarships provided \r\nto Pacific small island developing States students. In \r\nthe last three years, more than 60 Cuban-trained Pacific \r\nislands doctors have returned to serve their people. We \r\nthank Cuba for their solidarity and friendship with our \r\nsubregion of the Pacific. Solomon Islands and Nauru \r\nsupport draft resolution A/70/L.2 in its entirety, and we \r\ncall on all peace-loving countries to support the draft \r\nresolution as presented.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): First of all, we would like to express our \r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for having prepared \r\na comprehensive report (A/70/120), which outlines \r\nthe position of Member States in favour of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba.\r\nOur position of principle remains unchanged. \r\nWe believe that a swift lifting of the anti-Cuban \r\nembargo is an objective and long-overdue necessity. \r\nWe believe that unilateral economic pressure by the \r\nUnited States on Cuba, for purely political purposes, \r\nis not justified under current conditions and that it is a \r\nrelic of the past that causes significant damage to the \r\nsocioeconomic development of Cuba, as well as to the \r\ndevelopment of regional and international cooperation. \r\nThe continuation of sanctions, which is a vestige of the \r\ncold war, amounts to an effort to intentionally hinder \r\nthe Cuban people’s implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), which \r\ncontains a direct appeal to all States:\r\n“to refrain from promulgating and applying any \r\nunilateral economic, financial or trade measures \r\nnot in accordance with international law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations that impede the full \r\nachievement of economic and social development, \r\nparticularly in developing countries” (resolution \r\n70/1, para. 30).\r\nWe note the decisions of the Government of the \r\nUnited States to introduce a certain easing of the \r\nembargo regime. We consider that to finally end the \r\nembargo would be a logical outcome of the process \r\nthat began with the resumption of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba. The United States \r\nshould make all necessary efforts to comply with the \r\ndemands of its own domestic public opinion. That \r\nwould not only be in the interests of Cuba and the \r\nUnited States but would also contribute to improving \r\nthe situation around the island and allowing the Cuban \r\npeople to enjoy their legitimate rights to a life of \r\ndignity, and contribute to bolstering trade relations in \r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nGuided by the founding principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, which specify that any measures \r\nbased on discrimination or intervention in a country’s \r\ninternal affairs are unacceptable, the Russian Federation, \r\nlike the majority of Member States, is resolutely in \r\nfavour of a rapid lifting of the embargo against Cuba. \r\nGenerally speaking, Russia opposes any economic \r\npressure against sovereign States, which usually only \r\naggravates confrontational trends in international \r\nrelations. Bearing that in mind, Russia will vote, at this \r\nseventieth session of the General Assembly, in favour \r\nof the draft resolution on the necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, trade and financial blockade.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI, too, wish to welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Cuba, Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla. My delegation \r\nendorses the statements made by the representatives of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nof Ecuador on behalf of Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States, and of Paraguay on behalf of \r\n14/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nthe Southern Common Market and associated States. \r\nWe also wish to make the following comments in our \r\nnational capacity.\r\nBrazil heartily welcomes the restoration of \r\ndiplomatic relations between Cuba and the United States \r\nof America. We are pleased that the countries chose \r\nto engage in dialogue in order to reach that historic \r\ndecision and overcome anachronistic animosities. \r\nThat decision can have positive effects for the entire \r\nAmerican continent. Despite significant political \r\nadvances, the welfare of the people of Cuba continues \r\nto be affected by the economic, trade and financial \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba by the Government of the \r\nUnited States.\r\nBrazil reiterates its firm opposition to the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, as well as the extraterritorial application of \r\ndomestic trade laws and the adoption of discriminatory \r\ntrade practices. Such measures constitute a violation \r\nof the basic principles of international law, notably the \r\nrespect for sovereignty and the freedom of trade and \r\nnavigation. They also affect human rights, humanitarian \r\nlaw and refugee law, as they are detrimental to the \r\npopulations, especially to women and children, whose \r\nprotection ought to be a priority, especially the poorest \r\nand most vulnerable segments.\r\nWhile we acknowledge the statement made by \r\nthe President of the United States in regard to the \r\nneed to work towards putting an end to the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, as well as the measures that have been \r\nadopted to modify the application of the embargo, we \r\nare concerned about the upsurge in the extraterritorial \r\ndimension of the blockade, along with the increasing \r\nintimidation imposed in relation to Cuba’s international \r\nfinancial transactions.\r\nIt is vital that the United States Congress engage, \r\nas soon as possible, in a discussion on the elimination \r\nof the blockade against Cuba. In the meantime, we \r\ncall on President Obama to do everything within his \r\nexecutive powers to reduce the impact of the blockade. \r\nThat would not only be in line with the re-establishment \r\nof diplomatic relations between the two countries, but \r\nwould also constitute a measure that is necessary in \r\norder to ensure that the United States complies with the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s call urging Governments that have \r\nnot yet complied with resolution 69/5 to take the urgent \r\nmeasures necessary to eliminate discriminatory trade \r\npractices and put an end to the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargoes adopted unilaterally.\r\nBrazil welcomes Cuba’s progress in updating its \r\neconomic model. We wish to continue on that path, \r\nbut we need support from other partners near and far. \r\nCooperation with Cuba is systematically impeded \r\nby the illegal, illegitimate and inhumane economic \r\nembargo. My delegation votes in favour of taking \r\nadvantage of the space for dialogue and cooperation \r\nthat has been recently established, so as to bring an end \r\nto the embargo, which constitutes a f lagrant violation \r\nof the principles of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law. As we celebrate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations, putting an end to the \r\nembargo against Cuba would convey a strong message \r\nof renewed commitment to the founding principles of \r\nthe Organization in the sense of promoting a culture of \r\npeace and cooperation in the world.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China.\r\nIn September, the United Nations Summit on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda unanimously adopted \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), which has opened up new prospects \r\nand opportunities and defined new goals for \r\nglobal development and international development \r\ncooperation. We should strengthen cooperation in \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda, so as to \r\nembark on a development path that is equitable, open, \r\ncomprehensive and innovative with a view to achieving \r\ncommon development.\r\nUnder these new circumstances, it is necessary to \r\nimmediately put an end to the economic embargo and \r\nsanctions against Cuba. For 23 consecutive years, the \r\nGeneral Assembly has adopted, by an overwhelming \r\nmajority of votes, resolutions on the need to end the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. In those \r\nresolutions, the Assembly urges all countries to abide \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of \r\ninternational law and to repeal or invalidate any laws \r\nor measures that are of an extraterritorial nature and \r\ninfringe upon the sovereignty of other States or the \r\nlegitimate rights and interests of entities and individuals \r\nunder the jurisdiction of other State and have an adverse \r\nimpact on the freedom of trade and navigation.\r\nIt is regrettable that the resolutions have not been \r\neffectively implemented over the years and that the \r\n15-33534 15/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nAmerican economic, trade and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba remains in effect. That not only violates \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the relevant General Assembly resolutions, \r\nbut it has also inflicted enormous economic and \r\nfinancial losses on Cuba, impeding the efforts of the \r\nCuban people to eliminate poverty, promote economic \r\nand social development and achieve the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. It has hampered the right of the \r\nCuban people to exist and develop and has adversely \r\naffected economic, commercial and financial \r\ninteractions between Cuba and other countries.\r\nChina has always advocated respecting a country’s \r\nright to autonomously choose its social system and \r\napproaches to development and has opposed using \r\nmilitary, political, economic or other means to apply \r\nunilateral sanctions against other countries. China \r\nhas consistently strictly observed and implemented \r\nrelevant General Assembly resolutions. China and \r\nCuba have maintained normal economic and trade \r\nrelations and have exchanged mutual visits, which has \r\nled to mutually beneficial and friendly cooperation in \r\ndiverse areas. That has been in line with the wishes of \r\nthe peoples of China and Cuba and has been conducive \r\nto the economic and social development of Cuba.\r\nAgainst the background of multipolarity in a \r\nworld of economic globalization, cultural diversity \r\nand the democratization of international relations, \r\nthere has been a general trend for countries to carry \r\nout exchanges and cooperation on the basis of equality. \r\nDialogue based on equality and friendly consultations \r\noffers the best way to resolve disputes. In July, the \r\nUnited States and Cuba decided to restore diplomatic \r\nrelations, taking an important step in the normalization \r\nof relations between the two countries. We hope that \r\nthe United States and Cuba will maintain dialogue \r\nand consultation and strengthen the momentum of the \r\nefforts to improve relations between the two countries.\r\nChina has noted that the United States has started \r\nto partially lift bans on tourism, commerce and \r\ntelecommunication with Cuba and has the intention to \r\npush for the ultimate lifting of the trade embargo. We \r\nhope that the United States will completely abrogate \r\nits policy of economic blockade and sanctions against \r\nCuba as soon as possible and that the two sides will \r\ndevelop normal inter-State relations in accordance with \r\nthe purposes and principles set out in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the basic principles of international \r\nrelations. That will be in the common interests of the \r\nUnited States and Cuba, as well as of the peoples of the \r\ntwo countries, and will be conducive to the stability and \r\ndevelopment of the entire region of the Americas, as \r\nwell as to the common development of the international \r\ncommunity. China will again vote in favour of draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.2, submitted by Cuba under this \r\nagenda item.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): I would like to begin my statement \r\nby welcoming the presence here today of Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, and his delegation. At the same time, I would \r\nlike to welcome the presence of the Bolivian Minister \r\nof Mining and Metallurgy, Mr. Félix César Navarro \r\nMiranda.\r\nThe Plurinational State of Bolivia associates itself \r\nwith the statements delivered on behalf of the Group \r\nof 77 and China, the Non-Aligned Movement, the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\nand the Southern Common Market.\r\nToday, the Agence France-Presse news agency \r\nreported the dramatic case of Noemi Bernardez, \r\na 7-year-old cancer patient who needs the drug \r\ntemozolomide for her chemotherapy treatments. Noemi, \r\nwho lives in the Cuban province of Cienfuegos, has a \r\n70 per cent chance of surviving her disease if she can \r\nget that drug, but only 20 per cent if she cannot. As \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General (A/70/120) clearly \r\npoints out, because of the unilateral application of the \r\ncriminal blockade against Cuba, Noemi’s chances of \r\nsurvival are reduced.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s report once again makes \r\nplain the global rejection of the United States of \r\nAmerica’s arbitrary and unilateral imposition of an \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade against \r\nthe Cuban people — and against humankind. The \r\nembargo affects international cooperation, health and \r\nnutrition, education and culture, foreign trade and \r\nforeign investment in Cuba. It also has financial and \r\nbanking repercussions and restricts the potential for \r\nthe development of tourism, transport, civil aviation \r\nand other areas of the Cuban economy. The embargo \r\nis an example of the unilateralism with which the \r\nUnited States acts in the world. Notwithstanding the \r\nblockade, however, Cuba serves as an example of social \r\ndevelopment, cooperation and solidarity. Bolivia joins \r\nthe concert of nations in again repudiating, in the \r\nstrongest terms possible, the criminal blockade, which \r\n16/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nhas become one of the deepest open wounds affecting \r\nthe spirit of the whole human family.\r\nThe United States is unilaterally imposing an \r\nunjust blockade, an illegitimate blockade, an immoral \r\nblockade, an illegal blockade. The blockade violates \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nwhich all of us support, not only in word but in spirit. \r\nThe blockade violates the principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of States, the principle of non-intervention \r\nin the internal affairs of States, and the principles of \r\nindependence, multilateralism, respect for international \r\nlaw and self-determination. It violates every human \r\nright, and in particular economic, social and cultural \r\nrights.\r\nWe are all victims of that blockade owing to its \r\nextraterritorial character. It is not only Cuba but the \r\ninternational community that is attacked unilaterally in \r\nviolation of international law by the embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America. Today presents us \r\nwith an opportunity not only to vigorously condemn \r\nthis violation of international law, this genocidal \r\nblockade, but also to honour and express thanks for the \r\nsolidarity of Cuba. Bolivia continues to be a beneficiary \r\nof that absolutely unconditional solidarity, despite the \r\nconditions imposed by the blockade on Cuba. We now \r\nalso have an opportunity to honour the dignity and \r\nendurance of the valiant Cuban people.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by repeating \r\nthe words that Che Guevara uttered a few decades ago, \r\nrecalling a phrase from José Martí: “When one man is \r\nstruck, every true man should feel the blow on his own \r\nface”. In that light, Cuba, as a paragon of solidarity, \r\ngives the world a choice today. We must bear in mind \r\nthat girl Noemi. If homeland is synonymous with \r\nhumankind and if the embargo is synonymous with \r\ndeath, the choice has become homeland or death.\r\nWe shall overcome.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodriguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.2.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nLast 17 December, United States President Barack \r\nObama acknowledged that the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed on Cuba had failed, that \r\nit was obsolete and had not met the goals envisaged and \r\nhad harmed the Cuban people and isolated the United \r\nStates Government. Since then, President Obama has \r\nreiterated that the blockade must be lifted. He has asked \r\nthe American Congress to proceed in that direction \r\ninstead of acting against the will of American citizens, \r\nwho clearly support its repeal. He has committed to \r\nengaging in the debate for that purpose and to use his \r\nexecutive powers to modify its implementation.\r\nDuring the Summit on sustainable development \r\nleading to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and during \r\nthe recent general debate, more than 60 Heads of State \r\nor Government and delegations expressed appreciation \r\nand congratulations on the announcement of the new \r\ncourse in the relations between the United States and \r\nCuba, including the restoration of diplomatic relations \r\nand embassies, and many called for the embargo to be \r\ncompletely abolished. The interest and hopes aroused \r\nby those discussions and the subsequent vote, which \r\nwill take place under new circumstances, is therefore \r\nunderstandable.\r\nGiven the almost unanimous demand on the \r\npart of the international community, symbolized by \r\nthe favourable vote of 188 Member States last year \r\n(resolution 69/5), the participation of Cuba in the \r\nSummit of the Americas in Panama this year and \r\nthe call by a clear majority of American society and \r\nthe Cuban diaspora settled here, the United States \r\nGovernment has announced a new policy towards our \r\ncountry. But the measures adopted by the United States \r\nAdministration, which entered into force on 16 January \r\nand were later expanded on 18 September, although \r\npositive, only modified in very limited way certain \r\nelements related to the implementation of the embargo. \r\nMany of them cannot be implemented unless others \r\nare adopted that would finally allow Cuba to freely \r\nexport and import products and services to and from \r\nthe United States of America, to use American dollars \r\nin its international financial transactions and operate \r\naccounts in that currency in third countries’ banks, \r\nand to have access to credit and financing from private \r\nentities and international financial institutions.\r\nThe problem is not that the Cuban authorities \r\nhamper the implementation of those measures and \r\nthat the Cuban system would need to be modified in \r\norder to facilitate the process, as some United States \r\nofficials have asserted. The problem is the relentless \r\nand systematic existence of the embargo. We must not \r\nconfuse reality with the wishes and expressions of good \r\nwill. In such circumstances as we are now facing, one \r\ncan only judge based on the facts. And the facts show, in \r\n15-33534 17/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\na crystal-clear manner, that the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed against Cuba is still \r\nbeing fully and completely implemented.\r\nTen months after the announcements made on \r\n17 December 2014, no tangible, substantial modification \r\nhas been introduced in the implementation of the \r\nembargo. Cuba’s removal from the spurious list of State \r\nsponsors of international terrorism was the inevitable \r\ncorrection of an absurdity, but that has hardly had any \r\nimpact on the implementation of the embargo, which is \r\nbased on a far more comprehensive system of previously \r\nestablished laws and sanctions.\r\nJust a week ago, a $1.116 billion fine was imposed \r\non a French bank, Crédit Agricole, which must be added \r\nto the $1.71 billion fine imposed on the German bank \r\nCommerzbank last March for carrying out transactions \r\nwith Cuba and other States. In recent weeks, the secure \r\nmessaging system SWIFT cancelled a service contract \r\nthat covered the first payment by the American company \r\nSprint to initiate direct phone calls, and several other \r\nbank transfers to Cuba for the operation of charter \r\nf lights were withheld.\r\nThe meagre Cuban food purchases in the United \r\nStates of America, which were among the few exceptions \r\nto the embargo approved in 2000 by the United States \r\nCongress, have declined significantly in the past year, \r\nbecause they are subject to discriminatory and onerous \r\nconditions. Each purchase must be authorized by a \r\nlicense, and the granting of credits is prohibited. Cuba \r\nis forced to pay cash and in advance through banking \r\nentities of third countries and is prohibited from using \r\nits own vessels to transport those products.\r\nSomething similar has been happening with the \r\nimports of medicines and medical equipment that our \r\ncountry needs, and since 1992 United States legislation \r\nhas imposed conditions on them as well. Cuba is required \r\nto report on the final recipient of the medication it \r\npurchases. It is not allowed to make payments directly, \r\nbut only through third parties and in a currency other \r\nthan the United States dollar, which obviously entails \r\nadditional difficulties, delays and costs.\r\nNumerous other examples could be mentioned. \r\nThe example of the case of the Elekta company, \r\nwhich confirmed on 2 September that it will not be \r\nable to supply the National Institute of Oncology and \r\nRadiobiology nor any other hospitals in Cuba with the \r\nradioactive isotope iridium-192, which ensures the \r\nnormal operation of the brachytherapy equipment that \r\nis indispensable for higher quality treatments and more \r\naccurate cancer therapy. That is because its supplier, the \r\nUnited States company Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals, \r\nrefused to sell that isotope to Cuba. The American \r\ncompany, Small Bone Innovation, Inc., has refused to \r\nsupply prosthetic wrists and hand joints to the Frank \r\nPaís Orthopedic Hospital for patients with rheumatoid \r\narthritis. Last June, the United States company Sigma-\r\nAldrich refused to supply the company Quimimpex \r\nwith the products, services and technical information \r\nthat are indispensable to the chemical industry; and the \r\nNorth American company Columbiana Boiler Company \r\ninformed Quimpex that it was not allowed to export the \r\ncylinders needed to transport chlorine destined for the \r\ntreatment of drinking water.\r\nThe embargo is a f lagrant, massive and systematic \r\nviolation of the human rights of all Cubans. It \r\ncontravenes international law and has been described \r\nas an act of genocide under the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \r\nof 1948. It is the main obstacle to the economic and \r\nsocial development of our people. The human damage \r\nit has caused is inestimable. Seventy-seven per cent of \r\nCubans have been suffering from the embargo since \r\nthe day they were born. The shortages and deprivation \r\nthat it causes to all Cuban families are incalculable. \r\nAccording to rigorous and conservative estimates, the \r\neconomic damage it has caused after more than half \r\na century amount to $33,755,000,000, based on the \r\nprice of gold. At current prices, that amounts to more \r\nthan $121,192,000,000, which is a figure of enormous \r\nmagnitude for a small economy like ours.\r\nI hope the representative of the United States of \r\nAmerica will not come here now to tell us that draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.2 does not accurately reflect the spirit \r\nof dialogue or the generous attitude of his Government; \r\nor repeat the hackneyed line that the United States of \r\nAmerica is the social benefactor of the Cuban people, \r\nwhich wishes only to control its own destiny; or \r\ninflate the figure of $900,000 in donations that Cuban \r\ncivil society received in 2015, which the embargo \r\nhampered and our people appreciated; or refer to the \r\nfamily remittances, which are the result of difficult \r\nsavings on the part of Cubans living here, as if they \r\nwere Government funds; or consider as a commercial \r\nexchange the export licenses that have been granted but \r\nhave not actually led to any concrete exports.\r\nWhile it is up to the United States Congress to adopt \r\na decision ending the embargo, the President has broad \r\n18/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nexecutive powers to substantially modify the practical \r\napplication of the embargo and its humanitarian and \r\neconomic impact. We share the hope that the United \r\nStates Congress will change an ineffective, cruel and \r\nunjust policy, anchored in the past, and make decisions \r\nbased on the values  and feelings of its citizens.\r\nHistorically, the United States has tried to impose \r\nits domination and hegemony over our country and, \r\nsince 1959, to change the political, economic and \r\nsocial system that our people freely chose in the full \r\nexercise of their self-determination. Several voices \r\nfor the United States Government have stated that the \r\nannounced policy concerning Cuba means a change in \r\nmethods, rather than in objectives. If that is the case, \r\nthe process of normalizing relations between the United \r\nStates and Cuba will face serious obstacles. The lifting \r\nof the blockade will be the critical element that will \r\ngive meaning to the progress achieved over the past \r\nseveral months in relations between the two countries \r\nand set the pace on the road to normalization.\r\nAs President Barack Obama acknowledged, lifting \r\nthe blockade serves the national interests of the United \r\nStates and reflects the will of that country’s citizens. It \r\nwould be in no way acceptable or productive to require \r\nCuba to make internal changes as a precondition for \r\nlifting or lightening the embargo. Cuba is willing \r\nto accept the opportunities and face the challenges \r\nof a new era in relations between both countries, \r\nbut it will never negotiate its socialist system or its \r\ninternal affairs. Nor will it allow any blemish on \r\nits independence, which was won at the price of the \r\nblood of its finest sons and daughters and through the \r\nenormous sacrifices of many generations, dating back \r\nto our first wars of independence in 1868. As President \r\nRaúl Castro Ruz reiterated, both Governments must \r\nfind a way to coexist in a civilized manner, despite \r\ntheir profound differences, and, wherever possible, \r\ngo forward together, for the benefit of the peoples of \r\nthe United States and Cuba, through dialogue and \r\ncooperation based on mutual respect and sovereign \r\nequality. There is no enmity between the peoples of the \r\nUnited States and Cuba. The Cuban people expressed \r\ntheir solidarity with the American people during the \r\nterrible terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001 and the \r\ndevastating impact of Hurricane Katrina. We appreciate \r\nand recognize the progress that has been recently made \r\nand reflected in the reopening of the embassies, the \r\nvisits by the Secretary of State and the Secretary of \r\nCommerce to Cuba and the exchange of delegations. \r\nThat is in addition to the implementation of a bilateral \r\nsteering commission, the expansion of areas of dialogue \r\nand cooperation, particularly in the fields of aviation \r\nand aviation security, combating drug trafficking, \r\nillegal migration and human trafficking, cooperation in \r\nlaw enforcement, environmental protection and health, \r\namong others.\r\nWe are sincerely interested in developing fruitful \r\nrelations, including offering quality tourism to United \r\nStates citizens, who enjoy the freedom to travel to \r\nCuba, expanding cultural, sporting, scientific and \r\nacademic exchanges and multifaceted cooperation in \r\nareas of common interest, trade and investment. Based \r\non the premise of our significant differences and in the \r\nspirit of back-and-forth discussion, we have initiated \r\na bilateral dialogue on human rights. To that end, we \r\nhave been guided by the principles that are contained in \r\nthe Proclamation of Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nas a Zone of Peace, which was signed in January 2014 \r\nin Havana by the Heads of State and Government of \r\nthe Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, and by the principles and purposes enshrined \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations. That could also \r\nbe a modest contribution to the quest for an alternative \r\nway for all of us as human beings and nations to relate \r\nto one another in an era marked by global crisis, the \r\ninevitable impact of climate change, non-conventional \r\nwars that have unleashed ongoing atrocious conflicts, \r\nnew forms of terrorism, the existence of huge nuclear \r\narsenals, extraordinary spending on nuclear armaments \r\nand the risk of pandemics.\r\nFifteen years ago in this very Hall, the history-\r\nmaking leader of the Revolution Fidel Castro Ruz \r\nstated,\r\n“Humanity should be aware of what we have \r\nbeen so far and what we cannot continue to be. Our \r\nspecies has now enough accumulated knowledge, \r\nethical values and scientific resources to move \r\ntowards a new historical era of true justice and \r\nhumanism;\r\n“Nothing in the existing economic and political \r\norder serves the interests of humankind. Thus \r\nthis order is unsustainable and must be changed.” \r\n(A/55/PV.4, p. 20)\r\nThis year, 23 years after the adoption of the first \r\nof the resolutions emphasizing the necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America (resolution \r\n47/19), we have achieved remarkable progress. This \r\n15-33534 19/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\ncrowning achievement is due to the tireless resistance, \r\nthe self less efforts and firm convictions of our people \r\nand the leadership of the history-making generation \r\nof the Revolution, headed by Commander-in-Chief \r\nFidel Castro Ruz and President Raúl Castro Ruz. We \r\nare deeply grateful to all of the Governments and \r\ntheir peoples, parliaments, political forces, social \r\nmovements, representatives of civil society and \r\ninternational and regional organizations that, year after \r\nyear, especially in the General Assembly, have upheld, \r\nwith their voices and their votes, the fairness and \r\nurgency of lifting the embargo. We have made it this \r\nfar thanks to the ever-growing support of the American \r\npeople aimed at achieving that laudable goal, and we \r\nexpress our gratitude to them. We know that the road \r\nthat lies ahead of us is long and difficult. As long as the \r\nblockade continues, we will continue to put forward a \r\nsimilar draft resolution in the General Assembly. The \r\nCuban people will never renounce their sovereignty or \r\nthe path they have freely chosen to building a more just, \r\nefficient, prosperous and sustainable socialism, nor \r\nwill they abandon their quest for a more equitable and \r\ndemocratic international order.\r\nWe have sponsored draft resolution A/70/L.2, which \r\nrecognizes the reality of the rigorous and oppressive \r\nimplementation of the embargo against Cuba and, \r\nin new preambular paragraphs, also recognizes and \r\ncommends the progress achieved during the past year.\r\nOn behalf of the heroic, self less and supportive \r\nCuban people, I ask the Assembly to vote in favour of \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.2, entitled “Necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We shall \r\nnow proceed to consider draft resolution A/70/L.2.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in explanation \r\nof vote before the voting, may I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Godard (United States of America): Last \r\nyear, on 17 December, President Obama announced a \r\nnew direction in United States policy towards Cuba. \r\nAt the same time, President Castro Ruz spoke to the \r\nCuban people about beginning a new relationship with \r\nthe United States. Since then, the United States has \r\ntaken a range of historic measures designed to begin \r\nnormalizing United States-Cuban bilateral relations, \r\nincluding by adjusting United States regulations related \r\nto Cuba. Presidents Obama and Castro have met twice \r\nsince then. Although normalization will be a long and \r\ncomplex road, we have made considerable progress.\r\nWe regret, therefore, that the Government of Cuba \r\nhas chosen to proceed with its annual draft resolution \r\n(A/70/L.2). The text falls short of reflecting the \r\nsignificant steps that have been taken and the spirit \r\nof engagement President Obama has championed. As \r\na result, the United States cannot support it. If Cuba \r\nthinks this exercise will help move things forward in \r\nthe direction both Governments have indicated they \r\nwish, it is mistaken.\r\nOn 20 July, the United States and Cuba established \r\ndiplomatic relations and re-opened embassies in one \r\nanother’s capital cities. Secretary of State Kerry travelled \r\nto Havana on 14 August for the ceremonial f lag-raising \r\nat the United States Embassy, marking the first time \r\na United States Secretary of State had been to Cuba \r\nsince 1945. Secretary Kerry welcomed the occasion as \r\na day for pushing aside old barriers and exploring new \r\npossibilities. Indeed, he praised both President Obama \r\nand President Castro for “the courageous decision to \r\nstop being the prisoners of history and to focus on the \r\nopportunities of today and tomorrow”.\r\nSince that day, the United States has met with \r\nCuban Government officials in Havana to set a broad \r\nagenda for bilateral cooperation. We have agreed to \r\nhold dialogues in law enforcement, counter-narcotics \r\nand human rights. We have worked with Cuban \r\nhealth-care professionals to deliver improved care to \r\nthe poorest populations in our hemisphere. We have \r\ndiscussed ways to address the environmental and \r\nclimate change challenges we face in the years ahead. \r\nBy the end of the year, we hope to announce several \r\nconcrete accomplishments that will benefit both our \r\npeoples.\r\nAs we all know, President Obama has also called on \r\nCongress to lift the embargo as soon as possible and has \r\ntaken executive action to adjust regulations to facilitate \r\nmany transactions involving Cuba. President Obama \r\nhas argued that removing the embargo will increase \r\neconomic opportunities for the Cuban people through \r\nincreased trade and commerce and improve technology \r\nand information f low to the island, a goal we all share.\r\nWe do not expect Cuba or the United States to forget \r\nthe past overnight. We realize that fully normalizing our \r\nbilateral relationship will require years of persistence \r\nand dedication on both sides. We find it unfortunate \r\n20/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nthat despite our demonstrated bilateral progress, the \r\nCuban Government has chosen to introduce a draft \r\nresolution that is nearly identical to those presented in \r\nyears past. Nevertheless, the United States will not be \r\nbound by a history of mistrust. We remain committed to \r\nthe hard work of pursuing genuine bilateral cooperation \r\nwith Cuba for the benefit of both countries and for the \r\nhemisphere.\r\nThe United States also remains committed to \r\npromoting and encouraging respect for human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms for all in Cuba, as enshrined \r\nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We will \r\ncontinue to advocate for universal rights on the island \r\nand to build and strengthen connections between the \r\nCuban and the American people.\r\nMrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): Nicaragua would like to explain why it \r\nwill vote in favour of the people and the Government of \r\nCuba, together with the entire international community.\r\nWe wish to welcome our brother Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and \r\nhis delegation. He has provided us with extensive \r\ninformation about the impacts today of the criminal \r\neconomic, financial and commercial embargo against \r\nhis people and Government.\r\nWe reaffirm our unconditional support for and \r\nsolidarity with the people and the Government of \r\nCuba for their heroic gesture, the Cuban Revolution, \r\nwhich showed us the first steps towards dignity and the \r\nrestitution of rights to the peoples of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean. More than five decades of resistance, \r\nfull of bravery and sacrifice have elapsed since the \r\ninfamous day when a disgraceful imperialistic law \r\nauthorized the President of the United States to establish \r\nan economic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba, with the aim of provoking disillusionment and \r\ndiscouragement; creating economic dissatisfaction \r\nand hardship; denying access to supplies; and causing \r\nhunger, desperation, violence and the overthrow of the \r\nlegitimate Government of Cuba.\r\nYet Cuba stands before us. Its people and its \r\nGovernment, our brothers in solidarity, represent the \r\ndignity and sovereignty of our peoples. They were \r\nalways the first to respond to our needs in the face \r\nof disasters and emergencies. They taught us to read, \r\ntrained doctors and technicians, cured our diseases and \r\nhelped us to create conditions for our well-being and \r\nour happiness on Mother Earth.\r\nThe embargo, which has been increasing in terms of \r\nits measures and scope, is in fact a policy of genocide. It \r\nhas had a negative impact on the economic, social and \r\ncultural rights of the people of Cuba and amounts to a \r\nmassive, f lagrant and systematic violation of the human \r\nrights of an entire people.\r\nOur President, Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra, \r\nin referring to the embargo, has affirmed that the time \r\nhas come to end it. The situation has changed. Even \r\nin the United States, the majority of the population is \r\nagainst the embargo. Conditions have been established \r\nto enable President Barack Obama to decide to take this \r\nstep even if it goes against the system. We also recall \r\nthat the policy of embargo and sanctions has not led \r\nanywhere. The best proof of that is that, after 56 years, \r\nPresident Obama recognized that the embargo against \r\nCuba had been a failure.\r\nToday we welcome the fact that President Obama \r\nhas finally decided to take the first steps to begin the \r\nprocess of normalization and the re-establishment of \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States, which \r\nshould be done based on the legitimate interests of each \r\nparty, starting with the legitimate interests of the Cuban \r\npeople and of the international community, to put an \r\nimmediate end to the blockade. We firmly believe that \r\nglobal solidarity with Cuba and its people will continue \r\nto be resolute until this criminal embargo ends.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China, the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States, the Caribbean Community, \r\nthe Southern Common Market, the Association of \r\nSoutheast Asian Nations, the African Union, the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation and others have \r\nonce again reiterated their rejection and condemnation \r\nof the policy of the Government of the United States \r\nand shown their complete solidarity with Cuba and its \r\ndemand to put an immediate end to the blockade.\r\nDespite the re-establishment of relations, the \r\nUnited States has intensified its inhumane embargo \r\nand its measures with extraterritorial dimensions, \r\nheavily impacting exports and imports. The embargo \r\nhas resulted in a lack of access to foreign loans and \r\ninternational markets and has impacted the health and \r\neducation systems and the right to food. In short, it has \r\nadversely affected all aspects of Cuban life.\r\nNicaragua condemns the criminal blockade and \r\nall the measures and extraterritorial ramifications. \r\nNicaragua rejects any coercive and unilateral economic \r\n15-33534 21/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nmeasures to attempt to break the will and spirit of \r\npeoples and Governments. It is unacceptable to use \r\nthose policies to compel an independent population to \r\nchange its regime. The embargo continues to be the main \r\nobstacle to sustainable development and economic and \r\nsocial programmes in the fraternal nation of Cuba. It \r\nis totally inconsistent with the recently approved 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nThis year we have seen courageous decisions \r\nthat, in the short term, have led to changing situations \r\nthat have been maintained for more than five decades \r\nin relation to Cuba. We maintained the hope that, in \r\nthe General Assembly, we can continue to take bold \r\ndecisions and to vote unanimously in favour of lifting \r\nthe embargo. We have always listened very carefully to \r\nthe speaker who preceded me, and we had hoped to hear \r\nsomething different this time. Regrettably, once again \r\nwe heard the same rhetoric as in previous years, the \r\nsame arrogance attempting to justify the unjustifiable, \r\narguing for the continuation of a situation against the \r\nfraternal people of Cuba, which is the result of the \r\nimplementation of an obsolete and anachronistic policy \r\nthat they themselves have referred to as a failure. The \r\nentire world rejects it.\r\nNo, Cuba was not mistaken in presenting draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.2; the whole world supports it.\r\nTo conclude, while reiterating my delegation’s \r\nvote in favour of the draft resolution introduced by \r\nCuba, which we are about to vote on, we wish to recall \r\nthe words of the beloved former President of Chile, \r\nMr. Salvador Allende, who was murdered by dark \r\nforces, as we all are aware. Some day, America will \r\nspeak in the voice of the continent, in a united voice \r\nof the peoples, a voice that will be respected and heard \r\nbecause it is the voice of the people who are the masters \r\nof their own destiny.\r\nToday Latin America and the Caribbean, in \r\nspeaking for the continent, demands that the United \r\nStates Government once and for all rectify its policies \r\nagainst our continent. It should immediately put an end \r\nto the criminal embargo against Cuba. It should close \r\nthe prisons in Guantánamo and return Guantánamo to \r\nits legitimate owner. It should recognize and finally \r\naccept the will of our peoples to be the masters of our \r\nown fates and, abandoning its imperialist designs and \r\npolicies, once and for all establish friendly relations, \r\ncooperation and respect on equal terms for all the \r\npeoples and the Governments in our region.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in explanation of vote before the \r\nvoting.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take a decision \r\non draft resolution A/70/L.2, entitled “The necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei \r\nDarussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, \r\nCabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, \r\nCentral African Republic, Chad, Chile, China, \r\nColombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte \r\nd’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Denmark, Djibouti, \r\nDominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, \r\nEl Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Estonia, \r\nEthiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, \r\nGeorgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, \r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, \r\nHonduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran \r\n(Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, \r\nJapan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, \r\nKuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, \r\nLibya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, \r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, \r\nMongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, \r\nMyanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands, \r\nNew Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, \r\nOman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New \r\nGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of \r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao \r\nTome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, \r\n22/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nSeychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South \r\nAfrica, South Sudan, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, \r\nSuriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, \r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic \r\nof Tanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe\r\nAgainst:\r\nIsrael, United States of America\r\nDraft resolution A/70/L.2 was adopted by 191 votes \r\nto 2 (resolution 70/5).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Before \r\ngiving the f loor to speakers in explanation of vote after \r\nthe voting, may I remind delegations that explanations \r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Lucas (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\n(EU) and its member States. The candidate countries the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization \r\nand Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; and Iceland, a European Free Trade \r\nAssociation country and member of the European \r\nEconomic Area, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe re-establishment of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States of America and the \r\ncalls of President Obama on Congress to start working \r\ntowards the removal of the embargo have created a new \r\nsituation for all parties concerned. The EU warmly \r\nwelcomes those initiatives and encourages their further \r\nimplementation through appropriate steps by both \r\nparties.\r\nIn the meantime, however, the main restrictive \r\nmeasures are still in place. They are even more of an \r\nanachronism given the new circumstances. The United \r\nStates trade policy towards Cuba is fundamentally \r\na bilateral issue. However, beyond the damaging \r\nimpact of the embargo on Cuban citizens, the direct \r\nand indirect effects of extraterritorial legislation and \r\nunilateral administrative and judicial measures also \r\nundermine EU economic interests.\r\nAmerican legislation such as the Cuban Democracy \r\nAct of 1992 and the Helms-Burton Act of 1996 \r\nextended the effects of the embargo of the United \r\nStates of America to third-party countries. Within the \r\nframework of its common commercial policies, the \r\nEuropean Union has firmly and continuously opposed \r\nsuch extraterritorial measures. While we acknowledge \r\nthe decisions of the United States Government to lift \r\nrestrictions on remittances and family travel to Cuba, \r\nthereby allowing the provision of certain financial, \r\ntelecommunication and Internet services, and to \r\nremove restrictions on the export of tools and building \r\nmaterials to support the Cuban people, we cannot \r\naccept that unilaterally imposed measures impede our \r\neconomic and trade relations with Cuba. To address \r\nthat problem, in November 1996, the EU Council of \r\nMinisters adopted a regulation and a joint action to \r\nprotect the interests of natural or legal persons resident \r\nin Europe against the consequences of those laws.\r\nAt the summit between the European Union and the \r\nUnited States of America held in London in May 1998, \r\nan agreement was reached on a set of measures that \r\naimed to mitigate the problems caused by extraterritorial \r\nlegislation. It covered waivers to Titles III and IV of the \r\nHelms-Burton Act, a commitment by the United States \r\nGovernment to oppose future extraterritorial legislation \r\nof that kind and an understanding on the disciplines for \r\nstrengthening investment protection. It is vital that the \r\nUnited States of America fully observe and implement \r\nthat agreement.\r\nWhile EU-Cuba political relations are strictly \r\nguided by the 1996 common position, both parties \r\nare engaged in a negotiating process to define a new \r\nand ambitious framework. Since 2014, the European \r\nUnion and Cuba have begun negotiating an agreement \r\non political dialogue and cooperation to strengthen \r\nrelations and create an enabling framework for more \r\neffective dialogue, improved cooperation and expanded \r\neconomic relations. Human rights are at the core of \r\nEU external relations, including with Cuba. A first \r\nhigh-level discussion took place in June 2015. The \r\nEU remains determined to pursue a comprehensive \r\ndialogue with the Cuban authorities and all sectors of \r\nCuban society. We reiterate the right of Cuban citizens \r\nto make independent decisions about their future.\r\n15-33534 23/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nWe also reiterate our call on the Cuban Government \r\nto grant its citizens full, internationally recognized \r\ncivil, political and economic rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms, including the freedoms of assembly and \r\nexpression and free access to information. We call on it \r\nto ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights and the International Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights. In addition, following the \r\nvisit of the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the \r\nright to food, we encourage the Cuban Government \r\nto invite other special rapporteurs to visit Cuba. We \r\nwelcome the continued broad application of the Cuban \r\ncitizens’ freedom to travel, as well as the substantial \r\namnesty granted to prisoners on humanitarian grounds \r\non the occasion of the visit of Pope Francis. We note \r\nwith concern the continued high frequency of short-\r\nterm arrests and appeal for all freedoms to be fully \r\nrespected and protected.\r\nThe existing restrictions on the rights to the \r\nfreedoms of expression and assembly stand in contrast \r\nto Cuban achievements in health care and education. \r\nSimilarly, the slow progress of economic modernization \r\ngreatly hinders the economic development of Cuba. \r\nIn that context, we recall the adoption by the Cuban \r\nParliament in August 2011 of a set of economic and social \r\nreforms, and we hope that they will be expanded and \r\nimplemented in a way that will address the key concerns \r\nof the Cuban population. The economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica contributes to the economic problems in Cuba, \r\nnegatively affecting the living standards of the Cuban \r\npeople, while having consequences in the humanitarian \r\nfield as well.\r\nThe lifting of the United States embargo could \r\nfacilitate an opening of the Cuban economy for the \r\nbenefit of the Cuban people. Together, we again express \r\nour rejection of all unilateral measures directed against \r\nCuba, which negatively affect the interests of third \r\nparties and therefore violate commonly accepted rules \r\nof international trade.\r\nWe urge the Cuban authorities to bring about \r\nreal improvements in all the areas that we have just \r\nmentioned. Through its cooperation and the future \r\nframework agreement, the EU is ready to support Cuba \r\non its path of reform and modernization. Considerable \r\nprogress has been achieved in a constructive spirit, \r\nincluding on human rights, governance and civil \r\nsociety. We are encouraged by the knowledge that no \r\nsubject will be off limits during those processes. Given \r\nthat context, the member States of the European Union \r\nvoted unanimously in favour of resolution 70/5.\r\nMr. Zuain (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I would like to welcome Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and \r\ncongratulate him on the historic vote that we have just \r\nwitnessed.\r\nArgentina fully supports the statements delivered \r\nby the representative of South Africa, on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China; by the representative of \r\nEcuador, on behalf of the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States; and by the representative of \r\nParaguay, on behalf of the Southern Common Market. \r\nI would like to make several additional comments on \r\nbehalf of the people and the Government of Argentina.\r\nYear after year we meet to adopt by an overwhelming \r\nmajority a draft resolution on the necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against \r\nCuba. Despite its repetitive nature, the appeal retains \r\nits validity. In fact, its ethical, political and historical \r\nfoundations have been strengthened by the passage of \r\ntime, the persistence of the grievance and the increase \r\nin international support. During the past 20 years, we \r\nhave seen that increase transform this cause into a \r\nuniversal claim. Besides being global in nature, this is \r\na Latin American and Caribbean cause that unites the \r\ncountries of our entire region in a strong and consistent \r\nposition of solidarity.\r\nThe Argentine Government wishes to express \r\nhow pleased and optimistic it is about the restoration \r\nof diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates. It congratulates both Governments on their \r\ndecision to take the path of dialogue to resolve all \r\noutstanding issues on the basis of equality and mutual \r\nrespect. However, we note with concern that, despite \r\nsome progress, the embargo against the Cuban people \r\ncontinues to stif le them in a disgraceful manner. We \r\ntherefore hope that, first and foremost, the United \r\nStates complies with the commitments outlined and \r\nthat the rapprochement and dialogue between the two \r\ncountries can quickly and effectively lead to the lifting \r\nof the unjust and illegal embargo suffered by the Cuban \r\npeople and Cuban nationals living abroad for more than \r\nhalf a century.\r\nIn spite of the new context, the embargo continues \r\nto exist and to impede the economic, financial, social \r\nand cultural development of the Cuban people. In terms \r\n24/25 15-33534\r\nA/70/PV.40 26/10/2015\r\nof trade, just to give one example, Cuba is prevented \r\nfrom freely exporting and importing its products and \r\nservices to or from the United States, as the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba clearly explained a few \r\nminutes ago. Notwithstanding the measures announced \r\nby President Obama, which represent progress towards \r\nchanging the implementation of some aspects of the \r\nembargo, the laws and regulations that support this \r\npolicy remain in force and are rigorously implemented \r\nby the agencies of the United States Government, \r\nconstituting a financial, economic, social and cultural \r\nstraitjacket to which Cuba continues to be subjected.\r\nThis is an unjust embargo because it punishes an \r\nentire population, causes serious economic damage \r\nand impedes development. It should not be forgotten \r\nthat the cost to the Cuban economy of this inhumane \r\naction has exceeded $120 billion. It is a massive and \r\nsystematic violation of the most fundamental of human \r\nrights.\r\nWe wish to recall that the embargo was motivated \r\nby the refusal of a country to accept that a sovereign \r\npeople could elect its own political system, its own \r\nway to organize and develop itself and, in a nutshell, \r\nto choose its own fate. It was an absurd and morally \r\nunsustainable decision on the part of the United States \r\nand has even failed in its purpose, which was to crush \r\nthe Cuban people.\r\nArgentina strongly opposes the use of unilateral \r\ncoercive measures, the extraterritorial implementation \r\nof national laws and the adoption of discriminatory \r\ntrade practices. We therefore join and support the \r\nCuban call for the lifting of the embargo and the laws \r\nand regulations that underpin that policy, which are \r\nrigorously implemented by the United States.\r\nFor these reasons, Argentina reiterates its \r\ncommitment to the full implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the General Assembly in its \r\nresolution 69/5, and again urges the international \r\ncommunity to redouble its efforts aimed at the \r\nfulfilment of all the objectives that are set out in the \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly designed to ensure \r\nrespect for the sovereign rights of the Cuban people to \r\naspire to their prosperity and sustainable development.\r\nConsequently, Argentina once again rejects the \r\nembargo policy against Cuba imposed by the United \r\nStates, a practice that has been in effect for more than \r\nhalf a century, which in addition to being morally \r\nunjustifiable and to having a serious humanitarian \r\nimpact is contrary to the spirit of multilateralism. We \r\ntherefore hope that the process of normalization of \r\nrelations that has begun between the two countries \r\nleads to an early end being put to the embargo.\r\nMy country takes this opportunity to also renew \r\nits absolute commitment to the principles of the \r\nsovereign equality of States, non-intervention and \r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs, and freedom \r\nof international trade and shipping. We also call for the \r\nprompt return of Guantánamo to Cuba, another unjust \r\nand illegitimate act on the part of the United States.\r\nArgentina hopes that this is the last resolution that \r\nthe General Assembly will adopt on this issue and that \r\nnext year its content will be fully implemented by the \r\nUnited States, so that the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba may be relegated to \r\nthe past — an unjust past and one that the peoples and \r\nthe Governments of the world, by actions of solidarity \r\nof the kind witnessed this morning, will prevent from \r\nbeing repeated.\r\nMr. Ja Song Nam (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea wishes to associate itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Iran on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, as well as with the one made \r\nby the representative of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China.\r\nThe diplomatic recognition of Cuba by the United \r\nStates symbolizes a total failure of the hostile policy of \r\nthe United States against Cuba, which has persisted for \r\ndecades. However, the essence of the anti-Cuba policy \r\nof the United States remains the same; the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba is still \r\nin place.\r\nIt is the unanimous demand of Member States \r\nthat the United States put an end to the unilateral \r\neconomic, trade and financial embargo against Cuba as \r\nsoon as possible, so that Cuba can achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment in a peaceful environment.\r\nThe facts show that the United States embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, which has lasted for several decades in \r\nan attempt to overthrow the legitimate socialist system \r\nchosen by the Cuban people, is doomed to failure. An \r\nattempt to change a sovereign State’s political and \r\neconomic system or overthrow a legitimate Government \r\nthrough sanctions and blockade is a rampant violation of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and other international \r\nlaws, which stipulate the principles of respect for \r\n15-33534 25/25\r\n26/10/2015 A/70/PV.40\r\nnational sovereignty, the sovereign equality of States \r\nand non-interference in others’ internal affairs.\r\nAccording to data released by the Cuban \r\nGovernment, the total economic loss suffered by \r\nCuba owing to the embargo has reached astronomical \r\nproportions. The extraterritorial Helms-Burton Act, \r\nwhich expands the scope of the sanctions to other \r\ncountries wishing to develop peaceful economic and \r\ntrade relationships with Cuba, is hampering the joint \r\nefforts of the countries in the region that aspire to \r\npeaceful and stable development.\r\nIn accordance with its consistent stand against all \r\nforms of interference in the internal affairs of States \r\nand sanctions against sovereign States, the delegation \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, as in \r\nthe past, voted in favour of resolution 70/5, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”. We once again strongly urge \r\nthe United States to lift its embargo against Cuba once \r\nand for all.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like once again to extend \r\nour full support to and solidarity with the Cuban \r\nGovernment and the Cuban people, who are fighting to \r\nsafeguard the dignity and sovereignty of their nation in \r\nthe face of the United States embargo.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.50 p.m.\r\n"
