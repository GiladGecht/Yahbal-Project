The Government of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines applauds all the steps taken to \r\ndate, although the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade remains intact.\r\nMy delegation takes the f loor today to reiterate that \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo has \r\nbeen and continues to be a violation of international \r\nlaw. It is contrary to the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, and Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines re-emphasizes its deeply held conviction \r\nthat the ongoing embargo is a f lagrant and systematic \r\nviolation of the rights of an entire people. Moreover, the \r\nembargo against Cuba is not merely a bilateral matter \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States of America; due to \r\nits extraterritorial nature, it also violates the sovereign \r\nrights of many other States.\r\nAs far wealthier nations and institutions have \r\nlooked askance at our development struggles and \r\noffered only dubious prescriptions and platitudes, the \r\nCuban people have rolled up their sleeves and given \r\nfreely of themselves in a manner that has touched the \r\nhearts and souls of the Vincentian people. No dollar \r\namount can adequately reflect the value of that support, \r\nsolidarity and partnership, for which the Cuban people \r\nhave asked nothing in return. Our appreciation cannot \r\nbe overstated.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines believes that the \r\nblockade is not only illegal, but morally unsustainable. \r\nIn the introduction to his famed essay “Common \r\nSense”, Thomas Paine wrote,\r\n“a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it \r\na superficial appearance of being right, and raises at \r\nfirst a formidable outcry in defence of custom. But \r\ntumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts \r\nthan reason”.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.41\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n41st plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 27 October 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/12 15-33602\r\nA/70/PV.41 27/10/2015\r\nAnd so it is today with respect to the blockade. \r\nCitizens across the United States of America are \r\njoining the international community by increasingly \r\nvoicing their disapproval and calling for the lifting \r\nof the unilateral sanctions. For instance, the Cuban-\r\nAmerican community in Miami-Dade County is the \r\nlargest concentration of Cubans outside the island. \r\nThe community’s significance for local and national \r\nelections is frequently highlighted during election \r\ncycles and its members are often credited, or criticized, \r\nfor controlling United States policy towards Cuba. A \r\n2014 poll of that community, conducted by Florida \r\nInternational University, showed that 57 per cent of \r\nregistered voters would likely vote for a candidate \r\nwho supported replacing the embargo with a policy \r\nincreasing support of independent business owners. In \r\nthat same poll, 81 per cent of registered voters stated that \r\nthey would likely vote for a candidate who supported \r\nreplacing the embargo with a policy increasing support \r\nfor human rights. However the polling questions were \r\ncouched, the overwhelming conclusion underscores the \r\nnecessity of ending the blockade.\r\nOpposition to that inhumane policy is now almost \r\nuniversal in nature. The stirring and inspiring words \r\nof United States President Barack Obama’s inaugural \r\naddress to the General Assembly in 2009 remain \r\nrelevant:\r\n“The choice is ours. We can be remembered \r\nas the generation that chose to drag the arguments \r\nof the twentieth century into the twenty-first, and \r\nthat put off hard choices, refused to look ahead, and \r\nfailed to keep pace because we defined ourselves \r\nby what we were against instead of what we were \r\nfor; or we can be a generation that chooses to see \r\nthe shoreline beyond the rough waters ahead, that \r\ncomes together to serve the common interests \r\nof human beings, and finally gives meaning to \r\nthe promise imbedded in the name given to this \r\ninstitution — the United Nations.” (A/64/PV.3, \r\np. 11)\r\nLet us put twentieth-century arguments behind \r\nus. Let us forswear illegal, unilateral action. Let us \r\ninstead look to the future, keep pace with the times \r\nand heed the insistent and consistent voice of the \r\ninternational community. Resolution 70/5 is not simply \r\nsome ritualistic annual rite of the United Nations. It is \r\na matter of life and death for approximately 12 million \r\nCubans. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines naturally \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 70/5. However, we believe \r\nin change and live in hope that there will be no need for \r\nus to gather her next year to vote on this text yet again.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to welcome Mr. Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic \r\nof Cuba.\r\nThe delegation of the Sudan aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, Sierra Leone on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States, South Africa on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China, and Kuwait on behalf of the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation (see A/70/PV.40).\r\nThe delegation of the Sudan would like to clarify \r\nits position after the voting on resolution 70/5, entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States \r\nof America against Cuba”. We voted in favour of \r\nresolution 70/5 on the basis of our conviction that the \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba should end and that the \r\nGeneral Assembly should speak as one in condemning \r\nall unilateral coercive sanctions that run counter to \r\ninternational law, the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, and free trade and navigation.\r\nA few weeks ago, we adopted the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1), paragraph \r\n30 of which strongly urges Member States\r\n“to refrain from promulgating and applying any \r\nunilateral economic, financial or trade measures \r\nnot in accordance with international law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations that impede the full \r\nachievement of economic and social development, \r\nparticularly in developing countries”.\r\nThat underscores the illegality of the policies imposed \r\nby the United States of America against the Cuban \r\npeople, which have continued for 55 years. The \r\nimposition of coercive measures on a people, in an \r\nattempt to influence their national choices and freedom \r\nregarding their political, economic and social regimes, \r\nis totally illegal and undemocratic.\r\nThe General Assembly has always rejected coercive \r\nunilateral measures that adversely affect socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment, especially in developing countries \r\nThat was clearly voiced in the outcome document \r\nof the United Nations Conference on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, entitled “The future we want” (resolution \r\n66/288, annex). The same position has been reaffirmed \r\n15-33602 3/12\r\n27/10/2015 A/70/PV.41\r\nat previous summits and ministerial meetings of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China and the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\nIn that regard, we welcome the restoration of diplomatic \r\nand political relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America and the removal of Cuba from the \r\nlist of countries that sponsor terrorism. That is a very \r\npositive step. We hope to see similar positive steps that \r\nwill culminate in the total lifting of the embargo.\r\nSince 1997, our country and our people have \r\nsuffered under a unilateral embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States that is totally unfair and is renewed \r\nannually. It has adversely affected all aspects of \r\nlife, as it restricts banking transactions, trade and \r\nopportunities for international cooperation with \r\nother States, and impacts our progress in regard to \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. Our solidarity \r\nwith the people of Cuba and the Cuban Government \r\nis therefore a reflection of our principled rejection of \r\nthat aggressive policy, our deep-rooted solidarity with \r\nthe Cuban people and our empathy with their suffering \r\nunder an embargo that has deprived them of quality \r\neducation, health care and international cooperation. \r\nWithout a doubt, the poor are the primary victims. We \r\ncommend the position of the Human Rights Council in \r\nGeneva, which has appointed a Special Rapporteur on \r\nthe negative impact of unilateral coercive measures on \r\nthe enjoyment of human rights. We urge the General \r\nAssembly to fully support the Special Rapporteur.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation expresses its \r\nsolidarity with Cuba. We underscore the importance for \r\nall Member States, especially developing countries, to \r\nshow solidarity by rejecting illegal unilateral sanctions \r\nand measures imposed on developing countries. The \r\ndelegation of the Sudan calls for an end to the embargo \r\nand sanctions against Cuba, our country and all other \r\nStates and peoples suffering from the same policies.\r\nMr. Phansourivong (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): The Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\naligns itself with the statements delivered by the \r\nrepresentatives of the Islamic Republic of Iran, the \r\nRepublic of South Africa and Malaysia on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement, the Group of 77 and China \r\nand the Association of Southeast Nations, respectively \r\n(see A/70/PV.40).\r\nIn an era of interdependence, cooperation and \r\nengagement are key factors of peaceful coexistence \r\nand mutual benefit. In that light, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the Republic of Cuba and \r\nthe United States of America, which has opened a new \r\nchapter in relations between the two countries, which \r\nhad been stalled for decades. At the same time, we \r\nare concerned by the continuing unilateral economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba.\r\nWhile expressing its concern over the embargo \r\nimposed on Cuba, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic hopes that the recent re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations, which is the first concrete step \r\ntowards genuine normalization of relations between \r\nthe two countries, will lead to its lifting soon. The Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic believes that such a step \r\nwill mutually benefit both countries, as it will create an \r\nenvironment conducive to further enhancing dialogue \r\nand cooperation between the two countries, which in \r\nturn will contribute to improving the well-being of the \r\nCuban people and their Government and allow Cuba to \r\nengage in international trade and economic exchanges \r\nwith nations around the world, including the United \r\nStates of America.\r\nMs. Velichko (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): Belarus \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nOnce again, Belarus emphasizes the unacceptability \r\nof imposing unilateral coercive measures as a means of \r\nexerting political and economic pressure on sovereign \r\nStates. We deem such actions to run counter to the \r\nprincipal norms of international law, as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the 1970 Declaration \r\non Principles of International Law concerning Friendly \r\nRelations and Cooperation among States in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn 2015, the establishment of the post of United \r\nNations Special Rapporteur on the negative impact \r\nof unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights confirmed the timeliness of this issue and \r\nthe need to review the damaging practice of imposing \r\nunilateral coercive measures with a view to their \r\nsubsequent elimination. There are no good unilateral \r\ncoercive measures. They always only benefit the \r\npolitical ambitions of the countries that initiate them, \r\nand never take into account the interests of the States \r\nagainst which they are used.\r\nThe financial and economic blockade of Cuba \r\nby the United States of America creates artificial \r\nbarriers to trade and hinders the development of the \r\nCuban economy. Furthermore, for many years now \r\nit has infringed on the legitimate rights and interests \r\n4/12 15-33602\r\nA/70/PV.41 27/10/2015\r\nof Cuban citizens. Belarus supports the inalienable \r\nright of every State to determine its own model of \r\ndevelopment. Any attempt by some States to change \r\nthe internal political system of other States through \r\nresort to military, political, economic or other means of \r\npressure is unacceptable and counterproductive.\r\nIn that connection, Belarus calls for a speedy end \r\nto the economic, financial and commercial embargo \r\nimpsoed by the United States of America against Cuba. \r\nThe full lifting of sanctions could be one of the most \r\nimportant practical steps in the budding normalization \r\nof bilateral relations between the United States and Cuba. \r\nThe need to end these unilateral coercive measures is \r\nalso reflected in the outcome document of the 2015 \r\nSustainable Development Summit (resolution 70/1), \r\nheld in September, which was adopted unanimously \r\nby the States Members of the United Nations. Perhaps \r\nthe time has come to take the corresponding steps to \r\nimplement the outcome document, including by ending \r\nunilateral coercive measures.\r\nMr. Aldahhak (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, I should like to welcome Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba. On behalf of my country, I reiterate \r\nmy country’s full support for him and for the people \r\nand the Government of Cuba in dealing with the unjust \r\nembargo that successive United States Administrations \r\nhave imposed on Cuba for decades.\r\nMy delegation endorses the statements delivered \r\nby the representatives of the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nrespectively (see A/70/PV.40).\r\nThe decades-long embargo imposed on Cuba has \r\nset an unacceptable precedent that runs counter to \r\ninternational law and has left the people and country of \r\nCuba vulnerable to untold economic, social and political \r\ndamage. The embargo, which has been unanimously \r\nrejected, has exacerbated the hardships endured by \r\nCuba and led to material losses of over $121 billion to \r\ndate.\r\nFor the twenty-fourth consecutive year, an \r\noverwhelming majority of the General Assembly has \r\nconfirmed the illegal and inhumane nature of that \r\nembargo. The blockade runs counter to the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, international law, the principles of \r\nsovereign equality among nations and non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of States, numerous human rights \r\ninstruments, international humanitarian law, global \r\ntrade laws, and tenets of international development.\r\nWhile we recognize recent United States policies \r\ntowards Cuba, the re-establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations between the two countries and the United \r\nStates President’s recognition of this rapprochement, \r\nwe call for the lifting of the embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba since 1959. The \r\nembargo remains in force despite the successive calls \r\nby States Members of the Organization, United Nations \r\nagencies, regional organizations and specialized \r\nagencies to lift the embargo.\r\nToday, 191 countries voted in favour of resolution \r\n70/5. Once again, the international community’s call \r\nfor an immediate end to the embargo reaffirms the \r\nillegitimate nature of the embargo against Cuba. The \r\nvote against the resolution by Israel, the occupying \r\nPower proves the latter’s lack of respect for international \r\nlaw, the Charter of the United Nations and United \r\nNations resolutions.\r\nThe Syrian Arab Republic insists that the unilateral \r\ncoercive measures imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica and the European Union represent a f lagrant \r\nviolation of international law and amount to the \r\nimposition of Western hegemony and political and \r\neconomic pressure on other peoples. Such measures \r\nseek to subjugate and weaken Member States, run \r\ncounter to the provisions of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, constitute interference in the internal affairs \r\nof Member States, and reflect the collective punitive \r\npolicies practiced by the imposing countries. We all \r\nknow the devastating effects of the embargoes imposed \r\nagainst Iraq and Libya on the civilians of those \r\ncountries.\r\nMy country reiterates its condemnation of the \r\ncoercive measures imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica and the European Union against the Syrian \r\npeople. We emphasize the negative effects of such \r\nillegitimate unilateral measures, which prevent \r\nSyrians from meeting their basic daily needs; from \r\ngaining access to food, education, health care, fuel, \r\nagricultural equipment, air and ground transportation; \r\nand from maintaining aircraft and communications \r\nequipment, among other deprivations. Such collective \r\nmeasures violate the human rights of the Syrian people \r\nand negatively impact the Syrian economy. Winter is \r\ncoming and millions of Syrians will have no heating \r\nfuel as a result of the coercive measures imposed by \r\n15-33602 5/12\r\n27/10/2015 A/70/PV.41\r\nthose who claim to care for the well-being of the Syrian \r\npeople.\r\nWe wish to reiterate that the decision of certain \r\nStates to impose unilateral coercive measures is in \r\nviolation of resolution 68/200, on unilateral economic \r\nmeasures as a means of political and economic coercion \r\nagainst developing countries, and resolution 69/180, \r\non human rights and unilateral coercive measures. \r\nIn those resolutions, the General Assembly reiterates \r\nits condemnation and rejection of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures that infringe on the rights enumerated in \r\nthe Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other \r\nhuman rights instruments.\r\nThe General Assembly should take the measures \r\nnecessary to end the embargo and the imposition of all \r\nunfair unilateral coercive measures and hostile policies \r\nby some Members of the Organization. Such policies \r\nrun counter to international law, reflect aggression \r\nand violate the provisions of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Accordingly, my country wishes to see an end \r\nto the embargo against Cuba and unilateral, coercive \r\nmeasures imposed on other Member States, including \r\nmy country, Syria.\r\nWe hope that the voice of the international \r\ncommunity, which is expressed through the General \r\nAssembly and other international bodies, will be heard \r\nby the United States of America and that the legislative \r\npowers of the United States will comply with the \r\nprovisions of international law. My country therefore \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 70/5.\r\nMr. Jaime Calderón (El Salvador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We welcome the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Cuba, His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nwho is with us today.\r\nEl Salvador associates itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Ecuador on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nand of South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina (see A/70/PV.40).\r\nI should like to make the following statement in \r\nexplanation of my country’s vote in favour of resolution \r\n70/5, on the necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador respects the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and recalls that they remain \r\nvalid and should be respected by all States during the \r\nprocess of change that we have launched. Currently, \r\nthe members of the international community have been \r\nboth witnesses and active proponents of major changes. \r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nOrganization, this a decisive time for us in the light of \r\nthe new opportunities and global challenges we face as \r\nwe define a new paradigm of development, cooperation \r\nand solidarity among the peoples of the world. We \r\nentered a new phase in the future of humankind when we \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1).\r\nAgainst that backdrop, my country welcomes the \r\nimportant step taken by the President of Cuba, Raúl \r\nCastro, and the President of the United States, Barack \r\nObama, in opening a new chapter in history with the \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between the \r\ntwo countries. We believe it important to cite a statement \r\nmade by President Obama at a press conference, to the \r\neffect that we cannot keep doing the same thing for \r\n50 years and expect a different result. This statement \r\nclearly charts a new path in the relationship between \r\nthe two countries and with respect to the embargo that \r\naffects the Cuban people. As noted by the Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of El Salvador at the most recent \r\ngeneral debate,\r\n“we should also mention the process of detente that \r\nhas begun between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica, a process that has had a positive impact \r\nnot only on the relations between the two countries, \r\nbut also on the continent as a whole. El Salvador \r\nis pleased with the re-establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica and trusts that in the current favourable \r\nclimate, the will expressed to lift the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba will become a reality as soon as possible” \r\n(A/70/PV.28, p. 3).\r\nAlthough the regulations issued by the United \r\nStates Departments of the Treasury and Commerce \r\non 15 January are a step in the right direction on \r\nsuch issues as the reopening of embassies, visiting \r\ndelegations, a bilateral relations committee, travel \r\nto Cuba, telecommunications and remittances, such \r\nmeasures are limited in scope and will change only \r\ncertain aspects of the implementation of the embargo. \r\nHowever, the economic embargo remains in effect, and \r\nactions such as the 42 multi-million-dollar fines against \r\nUnited States and foreign companies for conducting \r\n6/12 15-33602\r\nA/70/PV.41 27/10/2015\r\nfinancial transactions with Cuba generate major \r\neconomic and commercial losses for the Government of \r\nCuba, those businesses themselves and, by extension, \r\nthe Cuban people.\r\nEl Salvador calls for an end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba, not \r\nonly because it is unjust and illegal but because it is \r\nnot supported by the international community. In \r\nthat context, El Salvador reiterates the importance of \r\ncomplying with the provisions of resolution 47/19, of \r\n24 November 1992, and all other resolutions that have \r\nbeen adopted every year since then by the General \r\nAssembly on this item, and which emphasize the need \r\nto end the embargo imposed by the United States \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nEl Salvador, a country committed to working for \r\npeaceful coexistence among nations, fully supports \r\nand voted in favour of the resolution on the necessity \r\nof ending the economic embargo against Cuba. To \r\nconclude, we reiterate the following three aspirations \r\nof our people and Government. We hope, first, that the \r\nGovernment of the United States will lift the embargo; \r\nsecondly, that the dialogue between Cuba and the \r\nUnited States will continue; and, lastly, that after so \r\nmany years, we in the Americas can sit around the same \r\ntable without anyone being excluded.\r\nMr. Mangisi (Tonga): At the outset, we would like \r\nto acknowledge the presence of the Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba.\r\nI take the f loor to explain my delegation’s position \r\non resolution 70/5, adopted earlier today by the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States. Of such \r\nimportance is that matter for my delegation that we \r\nhave decided for the first time to take the f loor and \r\nspeak to the issue, further to our demonstrated support \r\nin previous years by way of votes in favour.\r\nAfter more than two decades of the General \r\nAssembly’s consideration of this agenda item, the \r\nresolution adopted earlier reflects significant changes \r\nin the bilateral circumstances between Cuba and \r\nthe United States. We join those welcoming the \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between those \r\ncountries, and the steps that have been taken that \r\npositively modify the embargo. Such initial positive \r\nsteps towards the normalization of bilateral relations \r\nhave thus far stopped short of lifting the blockade, \r\nwhich presently remains in effect.\r\nFor decades, the embargo has caused significant \r\neconomic damage, amounting to billions of dollars, \r\nand resulted in immeasurable suffering for the people \r\nof Cuba, not to mention the difficulties that our own \r\nnationals themselves are facing as young university \r\nstudents in Cuba because of the current adverse \r\neffects of the embargo. As the longest-lasting system \r\nof unilateral sanctions ever applied to one country, it \r\nunjustly hinders the economic and social development \r\nof the Cuban people. Moreover, the embargo is contrary \r\nto the principles and purposes of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. We therefore join the call to end the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nFinally, the Kingdom of Tonga adheres fully to the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and accepted under international law, \r\nin particular the principles of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates, non-intervention and non-interference in their \r\ninternal affairs, and the freedom of international trade \r\nand, of course, navigation. We therefore voted in favour \r\nof resolution 70/5, to support the right of the Cuban \r\npeople to enjoy full freedom in their economic and \r\nsocial development.\r\nMr. Silwamba (Zambia): Zambia aligns itself with \r\nthe statements delivered by the representatives of Sierra \r\nLeone on behalf of the Group of African States, South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, respectively (see A/70/PV.40).\r\nMy delegation welcomes His Excellency Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, to this meeting.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport (A/70/120) and the views expressed therein. As \r\na nation, we have been part of the chorus of supporters \r\nof Cuba by voting and speaking in favour of similar \r\nresolutions for the more than two decades during which \r\nthe General Assembly has considered this item. Today, \r\nwe again reaffirmed our full support and voted in \r\nfavour of resolution 70/5.\r\nZambia continues to be greatly concerned that, \r\nafter 53 years of embargo and 23 consecutive General \r\nAssembly resolutions, the sanctions are still in place. \r\nIt remains Zambia’s concern that numerous laws and \r\nregulations are still in existence. Their effect is often \r\nextraterritorial in nature and they often affect the \r\nsovereignty of third States, together with the legitimate \r\n15-33602 7/12\r\n27/10/2015 A/70/PV.41\r\ninterests of entities or persons under their jurisdiction. \r\nCuba continues to face severe restrictions in its ability \r\nto raise the necessary developmental funds on the \r\ninternational markets.\r\nWe are not oblivious to the developments on the \r\nground, and we commend the diplomatic milestones \r\nthat have resulted in improved relations between the \r\nUnited States of America and Cuba. Zambia welcomes \r\nthe decision by His Excellency President Raul Castro \r\nof Cuba and His Excellency President Barack Obama of \r\nthe United States of America to re-establish diplomatic \r\nrelations in December 2014. In addition, Zambia \r\nwelcomes other subsequent measures undertaken by \r\nthe United States, including the decision on 16 January \r\nto amend the Cuban Assets Control Regulation and the \r\nExport Administration Regulations. Zambia further \r\nwelcomes the latter’s decision to take measures to \r\nremove Cuba from the list of State sponsors of terrorism, \r\nas was announced on 14 April.\r\nOn the basis of all this, my delegation believes that \r\na new dawn is before us and that a return to normalcy \r\nin the relations between the United States and Cuba is \r\nnow on the horizon. We need to support the ongoing \r\nefforts so that the momentum created thus far is not lost. \r\nNo one should be allowed to squander the momentum \r\nthat has already been built. We acknowledge that the \r\nunilateral sanctions against Cuba are still in place. The \r\npeople of that great country continue to experience \r\nthe effects of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against their country. The right to influence \r\ntheir own development path has been severely \r\nrestricted, with access for sourcing international \r\ntechnology and expertise in critical sectors — such \r\nas finance, technology, education and health, among \r\nothers — being greatly curtailed.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to reassure the \r\nCuban people of Zambia’s continued solidarity on that \r\nmatter. We equally commend the Government of the \r\nUnited States of America for the positive strides taken \r\nin the recent past. We will support all efforts aimed at \r\nrestoring the relations between the two nations. It is \r\nfor that reason that we continue to support the United \r\nNations call for lifting the economic embargo on Cuba\r\nMr. Amihai Bivas (Israel): Let me just say \r\nthat Israel follows with great interest the renewal of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States and \r\nCuba and clarify that our vote is an expression of our \r\nspecial relations with the United States.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): Let me first recognize \r\nand express our appreciation of the presence of Foreign \r\nMinister Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla on this very \r\nimportant occasion.\r\nThe delegation of Indonesia associates itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representatives of South \r\nAfrica, Malaysia and the Islamic Republic of Iran on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations and the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, respectively (see A/70/PV.40).\r\nFaithful to its history and to its national character, \r\nIndonesia is a country committed to peace, justice and \r\nequality. For that reason, Indonesia stands before this \r\nforum to once again declare its unrelenting support for \r\nan end to the embargo against Cuba. We must without \r\ndelay overcome that relic of another time, for it has no \r\nraison d’être in the new millennium that we are building \r\ntogether. I shall offer four valid reasons for ending it.\r\nFirst, it goes against the very principles of \r\nthe sovereign equality of all Member States, \r\nnon-intervention and non-interference in one another’s \r\ndomestic affairs, as stipulated in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Charter clearly states the need \r\nfor Member States to refrain from the threat or use \r\nof force against the territorial integrity or political \r\nindependence of any State. The continued imposition \r\nof an economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba clearly violates the Charter. All Member \r\nStates are equal. None is above the others, as we are \r\nbound by the principles of friendly relations among \r\nnations. Here at the United Nations, dialogue has always \r\nbeen the norm put forward by any civilized nation to \r\nresolve differences. There should be cooperation rather \r\nthan confrontation.\r\nSecondly, the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba has caused significant \r\neconomic and social hardship that can hardly be \r\njustified on humanitarian grounds. It has caused \r\nyears of deprivation for the people of Cuba, especially \r\nfor such vulnerable groups as children, women and \r\nolder persons. That is a great burden for a developing \r\ncountry, whose people would benefit tremendously \r\nfrom the good faith of the developed countries. We have \r\nalso been discussing an ambitious vision to eradicate \r\npoverty through an inclusive post-2015 development \r\nagenda. It will only be inclusive if those who are the \r\nmost vulnerable, including the people of Cuba, are \r\ninvolved in the process and able to reap the benefits \r\n8/12 15-33602\r\nA/70/PV.41 27/10/2015\r\nof development without any constraint on the part of \r\nforeign hands.\r\nThirdly, the sanctions constitute a counterproductive \r\npolicy that has curbed opportunities and economic \r\nbenefits for Cuba and other countries, including \r\ncountries that maintain economic and commercial ties \r\nwith Cuba. In that process, the sovereignty of other \r\nStates and their jurisdiction over their own national \r\nlegislation have been encroached upon. Cuba is not \r\nthe only victim. We, the developing countries, trade \r\npartners and financial investors are also the victims of \r\nthat undeserved embargo.\r\nFourthly, our regional experience in South-East \r\nAsia has raised immense confidence that engagement \r\nwill do more than isolation to advance the noble causes \r\nto which all States Members of the United Nations \r\nascribe. The time is ripe for relations between the \r\nparties involved to be transformed through constructive \r\nengagement. Cuba should be able to exercise its right \r\nto develop and grow, unhindered by restrictions to its \r\ntrade and other business activities.\r\nWhile it is true that some meaningful progress has \r\noccurred in recent times, such as the easing of travel \r\nrestrictions to Cuba and the removal of obstacles to \r\ntransferring remittances, the preferred outcome is for \r\nthe embargo to be lifted completely. Indonesia urges \r\nStates to renounce applying laws or measures of an \r\nextraterritorial nature that affect the sovereignty of \r\nother States, the lawful interests of their subjects or of \r\nother persons under their jurisdiction, and freedom of \r\ntrade and navigation.\r\nIn the light of all of the considerations I mentioned \r\nearlier, Indonesia continues to support this resolution \r\nand reiterates the call for the immediate cessation of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba.\r\nFinally, our message is simple. Our message is \r\nclear. This embargo has to end, and end now.\r\nMr. Lucas (Angola): Let me start by warmly \r\nwelcoming the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, to this meeting.\r\nThe Republic of Angola voted in favour of \r\nresolution 70/5, on the necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. In this \r\nexplanation of vote, Angola associates itself with the \r\nstatements made by the representative of Sierra Leone \r\non behalf of the African Group; the representative of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries; and by the representative of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAngola has been following closely the process \r\nthat led to the re-establishment of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba, which we \r\nwarmly welcome. However, although President Obama \r\nperformed a historic act of justice, notifying the \r\nAmerican Congress of his decision to remove Cuba from \r\nthe list of States sponsors of terrorism, this does not \r\nyet imply relief from the prohibitions and restrictions \r\nimposed by the laws and regulations relating to the \r\nblockade against Cuba.\r\nIn that context, Angola reiterates the urgent need to \r\nend the economic, financial and commercial embargo on \r\nCuba, which infringes on the right of the Cuban people \r\nto development and is contrary to the principles and \r\nrules of international law. The embargo also violates \r\nthe human rights of the Cuban people, the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nrules of free trade.\r\nAngola welcomes the desire expressed by \r\nPresident Barack Obama to work towards ending the \r\nblockade against Cuba and encourages both parties \r\nto work towards the full normalization of relations, \r\nincluding economic relations, as soon as possible. The \r\nblockade against Cuba is unilateral and the most unjust, \r\nsevere and prolonged sanctions regime ever enforced.\r\nAccording to the report submitted by Cuba to \r\nthe General Assembly (see A/70/120), the economic \r\ndamage inflicted on the Cuban people amounts, at \r\ncurrent prices, to more than $121 million. Angola \r\nregrets the fact that the American Congress has not \r\nyet approved any of the bills aimed at eliminating at \r\nleast some of the most conspicuous measures imposed \r\nby the embargo. On the contrary, about 10 legislative \r\ninitiatives have been presented to Congress with the \r\npurpose of strengthening fundamental aspects of the \r\nblockade policy, thus preventing President Obama from \r\npassing new executive measures or implementing those \r\nthat have already been passed.\r\nThe embargo affects the material, psychological and \r\nspiritual well-being of the Cuban people and imposes \r\nsevere obstacles on their economic, cultural and social \r\ndevelopment, with a significant negative impact on \r\nsensitive sectors such as health care, education, food \r\nand nutrition. It is an illegal and unfair act.\r\n15-33602 9/12\r\n27/10/2015 A/70/PV.41\r\nAngola notes with concern the continuation of the \r\nextraterritorial nature of the embargo, notably in the \r\nbanking and financial areas. It is unfortunate that the \r\nUnited States maintains this position despite the visible \r\nprogress achieved by Cuba in various areas, in which it \r\nhas helped many countries in need. A recent example \r\nof Cuba’s solidarity was its valuable contribution to the \r\nglobal efforts to combat the Ebola epidemic affecting \r\nthe West African region by sending several hundred \r\nhealth professionals, with outstanding results, in the \r\nfight for the eradication of the disease.\r\nAngola recognizes and encourages once again the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General to put an end to the \r\neconomic, trade and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba, which has been \r\nenforced for more than half a century. We therefore \r\ncall on the international community to intensify efforts \r\nto promote a constructive and transparent dialogue \r\nbetween the two countries, with a view to achieving a \r\ndefinitive solution to this problem.\r\nAdditionally, we encourage the United States to \r\njoin the overwhelming majority of States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, which have, through numerous and \r\nrelevant resolutions, called persistently for an end to \r\nthe embargo, with a view to providing an environment \r\nconducive to fruitful cooperation between the two \r\ncountries and Latin America in general.\r\nMr. Shava (Zimbabwe): I should like to recognize \r\nthe presence of the Cuban Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\namong us today and to thank him for his clear statement \r\non the ongoing diplomatic dialogue between his country \r\nand the United States.\r\nZimbabwe aligns itself with the statements delivered \r\nby the representative of South Africa, on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China; the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement; and the representative of Sierra Leone, on \r\nbehalf of the African Group (see A/70/PV.40).\r\nAllow me to make a few remarks in my national \r\ncapacity.\r\nFor the past 22 years, the Assembly has consistently \r\ncondemned and opposed the continuation of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo that \r\nwas unilaterally imposed against the people and the \r\nRepublic of Cuba by the United States of America. The \r\nAssembly has consistently demanded the unconditional \r\nlifting of the embargo against the Republic of Cuba, \r\nwhich has caused enormous human suffering and \r\neconomic damage to the people of Cuba. We believe \r\nthat its continuation is indefensible and unjustified.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba constitutes the single largest principal \r\nobstacle to Cuba’s trade and economic development \r\npotential. Zimbabwe shares the view of the greater \r\nmajority of the members of the Assembly that the \r\nembargo constitutes a f lagrant violation of the \r\nfundamental norms of international law and is contrary \r\nto the purposes and principles of the United Nations \r\nCharter, as well as the norms and principles governing \r\npeaceful relations among States. It also violates the \r\nhuman rights of the people of Cuba by undermining \r\ntheir access to various social services.\r\nDespite the burden of the embargo, Cuba has \r\ndemonstrated its commitment to development \r\ncooperation by assisting many countries in the areas of \r\neducation, health, humanitarian assistance and so on. \r\nMost recently, it contributed significantly to combating \r\nthe Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\r\nZimbabwe joins other members of the Assembly in \r\ncalling for an immediate and unconditional lifting of \r\nthe embargo in order to allow the people of Cuba to \r\nfreely chart their own economic and social destiny, like \r\nany other sovereign State. We also join other Member \r\nStates in rejecting the promulgation and application \r\nof national laws with extraterritorial impact, and all \r\nother coercive economic measures, including unilateral \r\nsanctions, that mainly target developing countries \r\nseeking to assert their sovereignty. As a victim of such \r\nill-conceived, illegal and immoral economic sanctions, \r\nZimbabwe fully understands their impact and therefore \r\ncalls on Member States to refrain from promulgating \r\nand applying such laws and measures.\r\nWhile we commend the United States of America’s \r\nrestoration of full diplomatic relations with the Republic \r\nof Cuba, as well as its loosening of some aspects of \r\nthe embargo, Zimbabwe is of the view that lifting the \r\nembargo altogether and immediately is essential to the \r\nfull normalization of relations. We believe it will have \r\nmutual benefits for both countries in the form of the \r\ncreation of new business and trade opportunities.\r\nIn conclusion, the outcome of today’s vote \r\non resolution 70/5 clearly demonstrates that the \r\ninternational community is unanimous in its desire for \r\nan immediate end to the United States trade embargo \r\non Cuba. In anticipation of the lifting of the embargo \r\nand the full normalization of bilateral relations, we \r\n10/12 15-33602\r\nA/70/PV.41 27/10/2015\r\nhope this is the last time that the Assembly has to deal \r\nwith this agenda item.\r\nMr. Berridge (Saint Kitts and Nevis): The \r\nGovernment of Saint Kitts and Nevis wishes to register \r\nits support for today’s adoption of resolution 70/5, \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”.\r\nAt the outset, Saint Kitts and Nevis associates itself \r\nwith the statements delivered by the representatives \r\nof the Republic of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, of Jamaica on behalf of the \r\nCaribbean Community and of Ecuador on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(see A/70/PV.40).\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis welcomes the re-establishment \r\nof diplomatic relations between the Republic of Cuba \r\nand the United States. That was indeed a historic \r\nmoment, ushering in a new era in bilateral relations \r\nbetween the two countries, and it holds much promise \r\nfor the wider hemispheric region. Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis regrets, however, that the blockade of Cuba \r\nhas remained in place. Stiff fines are being imposed \r\non financial institutions and other establishments \r\nthat engage in business transactions with Cuba. That \r\nunilateral policy has imposed indiscriminate hardship \r\non the people of Cuba and continues to adversely affect \r\na wide gamut of sectors in the Cuban economy, from \r\nagriculture, medicine and education to sports and \r\nculture, energy, mining, tourism and transport. It has \r\nalso created impediments to Cuba’s socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIt is evident that even with the recent rapprochement \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba, the persistence \r\nof the economic, commercial and financial blockade \r\nhas had untold repercussions for the development of \r\nthe Cuban economy, to the detriment of the Cuban \r\npopulace. While the people of Cuba have been forced to \r\nbe creative in order to circumvent the negative impact \r\nof the embargo, the economic fallout has been real. \r\nBillions of dollars have been either diverted or spent \r\non sourcing supplies from other countries, thereby \r\nincreasing the transaction value of the goods involved.\r\nIn spite of the hardship experienced by the \r\nGovernment and people of Cuba, we have witnessed \r\na strong demonstration of goodwill and generosity \r\ntowards its sister countries in the Caribbean and \r\nbeyond. Indeed, Cuba has risen to challenges in time of \r\nneed, lending expertise and sharing its scarce resources \r\nin order to assist humankind. The Government of \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis would like to place on record its \r\nappreciation for the support Cuba has provided in the \r\nareas of tertiary education, sports, culture, medicine, \r\nhealth care and agriculture.\r\nIt is indeed regrettable that the Government and \r\nthe people of Cuba have suffered as a result of this \r\nunilateral measure imposed by the United States \r\nfor more than four decades. We join the rest of the \r\ninternational community in calling for an immediate \r\nend to the embargo against the people of Cuba, which \r\nhas had such deleterious effects on its community. We \r\nalso urge the United States to accelerate the steps it \r\nhas already taken to formally normalize relations with \r\nCuba. In doing so, the powers that be would effectively \r\nunlock the vast potential that is associated with free \r\nand fair trade.\r\nThis is a momentous period for the international \r\ncommunity. In the aftermath of the United Nations \r\nSummit for the adoption of the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, and our leaders’ commitment to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), ushering in a paradigm shift in development \r\nand engagement, we reiterate our call for an end to \r\nthis unilateral action, which runs counter to that \r\nendeavour. It is therefore an opportune time for this \r\nvestige of a bygone era to be done away with. With \r\nthat accomplished, we are confident that the people of \r\nCuba will have a better chance to achieve the Goals and \r\ntargets established within the three dimensions of the \r\nSustainable Development Agenda by 2030.\r\nMr. Tin (Myanmar): My delegation would first like \r\nto join others in welcoming the presence of Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, at today’s important meeting.\r\nMy delegation has taken the f loor to explain \r\nits position on resolution 70/5, entitled “Necessity \r\nof ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed by the United States of America \r\nagainst Cuba”, adopted today by an overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of South Africa on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement and of Malaysia on behalf of the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (see A/70/PV.40).\r\n15-33602 11/12\r\n27/10/2015 A/70/PV.41\r\nMyanmar voted in favour of today’s resolution in \r\norder to demonstrate once again its firm opposition \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed on Cuba. Since the first time this text was \r\nintroduced in the General Assembly in 1992, a growing \r\nnumber of Member States have shown their strong \r\nsupport for and solidarity with the Government and the \r\npeople of Cuba by voting in its favour. My delegation \r\nalso joins the international community in calling for an \r\nend to the embargo, which has resulted in huge material \r\nlosses and economic damage to the Cuban people. As a \r\ncountry that has gone through similar experiences for \r\ndecades, Myanmar fully understands the degree of loss \r\nand suffering that sanctions cause the people. In the \r\nend, they are counterproductive, since they affect only \r\nthe innocent people of the countries concerned.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nMyanmar has steadfastly adhered to its principled \r\nposition of opposition to the use of unilateral economic \r\nand trade sanctions. Sanctions are also contrary to the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, as well \r\nas those of international law and good neighbourliness. \r\nMyanmar has always maintained that relations between \r\nmembers of the international community should be \r\nbased on mutual respect and that differences should be \r\nresolved through dialogue.\r\nMyanmar welcomes the recent positive steps \r\nthe United States and Cuba have taken to normalize \r\ntheir bilateral relations. We also welcome the recent \r\nreopening of their respective embassies in Washington \r\nand Havana. We hope that such efforts will lead to the \r\nlifting of the embargo on Cuba as soon as possible, which \r\nwould not only benefit the peoples of both countries but \r\nwould also contribute to peace and prosperity in the \r\nregion as a whole. For that reason, Myanmar once again \r\nvoted in favour of the resolution.\r\nMr. Mac-Donald (Suriname): I would first like to \r\nwelcome the presence here this morning and afternoon \r\nof His Excellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and to thank him \r\nfor his statement (see A/70/PV.40).\r\nAt the outset, Suriname wishes to align itself with \r\nthe statements delivered earlier by the representatives \r\nof South Africa on behalf of the Group of 77 and \r\nChina, of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, of Kuwait on behalf of \r\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation, of Ecuador \r\non behalf of the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean Countries and of Jamaica on behalf of the \r\nCaribbean Community (see A/70/PV.40).\r\nIn addressing the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nsixth session, the President of the Republic of Suriname, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, while \r\nreiterating Suriname’s deep concern about the persisting \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba, \r\nposed this question: “How many more resolutions need \r\nto be adopted before justice can be done for the people \r\nof Cuba?” (A/66/PV.16, p. 21) Last month, our Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs, in her address during the general \r\ndebate for the seventieth session remarked that\r\n“[m]y Government welcomes the positive steps \r\ntaken towards normalizing bilateral relations \r\nbetween the Republic of Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America. Suriname has a longstanding \r\nfriendship with the people of Cuba and we are of \r\nthe view that the ongoing process of strengthening \r\nrelations will help to enhance peace, stability, \r\nunity and development in the Americas. We agree \r\nwith the international community that lifting the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo on \r\nCuba should be a top priority” (A/70/PV.28, p. 16).\r\nThe blockade of Cuba and its friendly people, \r\nwhich has been in place since the beginning of the \r\n1960s, has caused and continues to cause hardship \r\nto the Cuban people, undermining Cuba’s efforts to \r\nachieve sustainable development for its people. It denies \r\nthe Cuban people access to basic goods and necessary \r\nmedicines. In addition, there has been no easing of \r\nthe problems with financial transactions conducted in \r\nUnited States dollars. On the contrary, the economic \r\ndamage that the blockade has done to Cuba is enormous. \r\nIt is also unacceptable that third countries have to \r\nsuffer from a unilaterally imposed embargo on Cuba \r\nwhen they maintain normal relations with that island \r\nnation. The enjoyment of the right to an education is \r\nalso central to achieving sustainable development, and \r\nthe Cuban people are also denied that basic right by the \r\nhefty fees imposed on the transportation and shipment \r\nof education supplies.\r\nCuba has always positioned itself as an ally and \r\nfriend to its brothers and sisters in the global South. \r\nNotwithstanding the severe challenges and constraints \r\nit has to deal with, it has demonstrated its commitment \r\nto collaborating with other developing countries, as \r\nwell as to helping them when crises emerge. Many \r\nof us, including my own country, have benefited and \r\n12/12 15-33602\r\nA/70/PV.41 27/10/2015\r\ncontinue to benefit from our various cooperation \r\nprogrammes with Cuba. It is therefore disheartening \r\nto note that for the twenty-fourth consecutive time the \r\nGeneral Assembly has been asked to consider today’s \r\nresolution 70/5, on ending the economic, financial \r\nand commercial embargo against Cuba, even when \r\nit is condemned by an overwhelming majority of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe international community reiterates the call \r\nfor respect for the rule of law and its importance in \r\nachieving sustainable development. The Government \r\nof the Republic of Suriname is of the considered view \r\nthat sovereign equality, non-interference in countries’ \r\ninternal affairs and other relevant norms governing \r\ninternational relations should be respected at all times. \r\nWe believe that now is the time to do the right thing. \r\nWe are convinced that lifting the embargo will greatly \r\nbenefit the Cuban people. Mindful of that crucial fact, \r\nSuriname has maintained its longstanding position and \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 70/5.\r\nMrs. Carrión (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould first like to welcome the presence here today \r\nof Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba. Uruguay aligns itself with the \r\nstatements delivered earlier on behalf of the Southern \r\nCommon Market, the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States and the Group of 77 and China \r\n(see A/70/PV.40).\r\nUruguay voted in favour of resolution 70/5 today \r\nfor the following reasons. We welcome the restoration \r\nof diplomatic relations between the Governments of \r\nCuba and the United States, which we recognize as a \r\npositive step towards the beginning of a new chapter \r\nin the relations between both countries. However, the \r\ncontinued blockade is still having a severe economic \r\nand humanitarian impact on the Cuban people. We are \r\npleased that Cuba has been removed from the list of \r\nStates that sponsor terrorism, which it never should \r\nhave been on in the first place.\r\nThe Eastern Republic of Uruguay reiterates the firm \r\nposition it has expressed on many occasions against \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial blockade of \r\nCuba and its effect on the well-being of the people of \r\nCuba. Contrary to the principles of justice and human \r\nrights, the blockade effectively represents a collective \r\npunishment of the Cuban people by seriously damaging \r\nthe country’s economy and limiting and delaying its \r\ndevelopment. For that reason, as in previous years, \r\nthis year Uruguay voted in favour of the resolution \r\npresented by Cuba in the understanding that the \r\nblockade contravenes the rule of law internationally and \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, particularly those relating to non-interference, \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes and the judicial \r\nsovereignty of States.\r\nOn principle, Uruguay rejects and does not \r\nrecognize in its national legislation another State’s \r\nextraterritorial application of its internal laws. In that \r\nregard, we condemn the United States of America’s \r\nimposition of unilateral coercive measures on Cuba, \r\nwhich represents a form of oppression and an obstacle \r\nto dialogue and the essential and recently renewed \r\nrapprochement between the parties. We also believe that \r\nthe situation is contrary to the standards that regulate \r\ninternational trade and bind the members of the World \r\nTrade Organization. In voting in favour of resolution \r\n70/5 today, Uruguay reiterates its commitment to \r\nmultilateralism as a legitimate instrument for the \r\nsettlement of disputes among States and an effective \r\nway to encourage international cooperation, human \r\nrights, security and understanding among peoples.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 42?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.20 p.m.\r\n"
