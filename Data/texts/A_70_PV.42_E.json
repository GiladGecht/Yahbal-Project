Those States are eligible for immediate \r\nre-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that, after 1 January \r\n2016, the following States will remain members of the \r\nCommittee: Armenia, Belarus, Benin, Brazil, Burkina \r\nFaso, Cameroon, China, Cuba, Ethiopia, Equatorial \r\nGuinea, Haiti, the Islamic Republic of Iran, Italy, Japan, \r\nMorocco, Namibia, Pakistan, Portugal, the Republic of \r\nKorea, Saudi Arabia, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of \r\nGreat Britain and Northern Ireland, the United States \r\nof America, Uruguay and the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela. Those 25 States are therefore not eligible in \r\nthis election.\r\nI should now like to inform members that the \r\nfollowing States have been nominated by the Economic \r\nand Social Council: the United Republic of Tanzania \r\nand Zimbabwe, for the two seats among the African \r\nStates; the Russian Federation, for the one seat among \r\nthe Eastern European States; Argentina and Peru, for \r\nthe two seats among the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates; and France, for one of the two seats among the \r\nWestern European and other States.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the rules of \r\nprocedure, all elections should be held by secret ballot \r\nand there shall be no nominations. However, I should \r\nlike to recall paragraph 16 of decision 34/401, whereby \r\nthe practice of dispensing with the secret ballot for \r\nelections to subsidiary organs when the number of \r\ncandidates corresponds to the number of seats to be \r\nfilled should become standard, unless a delegation \r\nspecifically requests a vote on a given election.\r\nIn the absence of such a request, may I take it that \r\nthe Assembly decides to proceed to the election on the \r\nbasis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: The number of States \r\nnominated from among the African States, the Eastern \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.42\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n42nd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 28 October 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/5 15-33818\r\nA/70/PV.42 28/10/2015\r\nEuropean States, the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, and the Western European and other States is \r\nequal to or less than the number of seats to be filled \r\nin each of those groups. May I therefore take it that \r\nthe Assembly wishes to declare those States nominated \r\nby the Economic and Social Council — namely, \r\nArgentina, France, Peru, the Russian Federation, the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania and Zimbabwe — elected \r\nmembers of the Committee for Programme and \r\nCoordination for a three-year term of office beginning \r\non 1 January 2016?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I congratulate the States \r\nthat have just been elected members of the Committee \r\nfor Programme and Coordination.\r\nMembers are reminded that the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil postponed the nomination of one member from \r\nthe Western European and other States for election for a \r\nthree-year term beginning on 1 January 2016. Members \r\nare also reminded that there remains one vacancy from \r\namong the Western European and other States, for a \r\nterm beginning on the date of election and expiring \r\non 31 December 2015, and one vacancy each from the \r\nAsia-Pacific States and the Western European and other \r\nStates, for a term beginning on the date of election and \r\nexpiring on 31 December 2017. The General Assembly \r\nwill be in a position to act on these vacancies upon \r\nnomination by the Economic and Social Council.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item 113.\r\n(e) Election of eighteen members of the Human \r\nRights Council\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly \r\nwill now turn to sub-item (e) of agenda item 113 for the \r\nelection of 18 members of the Human Rights Council \r\nto replace those members whose term of office expires \r\non 31 December 2015. The 18 outgoing members are \r\nas follows: Argentina, Brazil, Côte d’Ivoire, Estonia, \r\nEthiopia, Gabon, Germany, Ireland, Japan, Kazakhstan, \r\nKenya, Montenegro, Pakistan, the Republic of Korea, \r\nSierra Leone, the United Arab Emirates, the United \r\nStates of America and the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 7 of resolution 60/251, \r\nof 15 March 2006, those Member States are eligible \r\nfor immediate re-election, except the delegation that \r\nhas served two consecutive terms, namely, the United \r\nStates of America.\r\nThe 18 vacant seats should be distributed among \r\nthe regional groups as follows: five seats for the African \r\nStates, five seats for the Asia-Pacific States, two seats \r\nfor the Eastern European States, three seats for the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, and three seats \r\nfor the Western European and other States.\r\nThe General Assembly will now proceed to the \r\nelection of the 18 members of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. In accordance with resolution 60/251, \r\nmembership in the Council shall be open to all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, and the members of \r\nthe Council shall serve for a period of three years. \r\nThe members of the Council shall be elected directly \r\nand individually, by secret ballot, by the majority of \r\nthe members of the General Assembly. Accordingly, \r\n97 votes constitute a majority in the General Assembly, \r\nwhich has a membership of 193 States.\r\nIn accordance with paragraphs 4 and 5 of resolution \r\n65/281, of 17 June 2011, beginning in 2013 the Human \r\nRights Council started its yearly membership cycle on \r\n1 January and, as a transitional measure, the period of \r\noffice of members of the Human Rights Council ending \r\nin June 2015 was exceptionally extended until the end \r\nof the calendar year.\r\nThe following States will continue to be members \r\nof the Human Rights Council: Albania, Algeria, \r\nBangladesh, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, \r\nBotswana, China, the Congo, Cuba, El Salvador, \r\nFrance, Ghana, India, Indonesia, Latvia, Maldives, \r\nMexico, Morocco, Namibia, the Netherlands, Nigeria, \r\nParaguay, Portugal, Qatar, the Russian Federation, \r\nSaudi Arabia, South Africa, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, the United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland and Viet Nam. The names \r\nof those States therefore should not appear on the ballot \r\npapers.\r\nThe election will be held in accordance with the \r\nrelevant rules of procedure of the General Assembly on \r\nelections. For this election, rules 92 and 94 of the rules \r\nof procedure shall be applied.\r\nConsistent with the practice of the General \r\nAssembly, if more than the required number of Member \r\nStates have obtained the votes of the majority of the \r\nmembers of the Assembly on the same ballot, those \r\nMember States that have obtained the largest number \r\n15-33818 3/5\r\n28/10/2015 A/70/PV.42\r\nof votes above the required majority will be considered \r\nas elected, up to the number of seats to be filled.\r\nAlso, consistent with past practice, if, in case of a \r\ntie vote, it should become necessary to determine one \r\ncandidate to be elected or that will proceed to the next \r\nround of restricted balloting, there will be a special \r\nrestricted ballot limited to those candidates that have \r\nobtained an equal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Accordingly, the election \r\nshall be held by secret ballot, and there shall be no \r\nnominations.\r\nAgain, I should like to repeat that the 18 vacant \r\nseats are to be filled from among the regional groups as \r\nfollows: five seats from among the African States, five \r\nseats from among the Asia-Pacific States, two seats \r\nfrom among the Eastern European States, three seats \r\nfrom among the Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nand three seats from among the Western European and \r\nother States. The ballot papers reflect that pattern.\r\nI have also been informed by the Secretariat that \r\nvoluntary pledges and commitments made by Member \r\nStates, in accordance with paragraph 8 of resolution \r\n60/251, were issued, when received on time, before \r\nthe elections, as official documents of the seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s nameplate.\r\nI should like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time when the General \r\nAssembly is conducting the elections. Please be \r\nreminded that, during the voting procedure, all \r\ncampaigning should cease in the General Assembly \r\nHall. That means that, once the voting has begun, no \r\nmore campaign material can be distributed inside the \r\nHall. All representatives are requested to remain at \r\ntheir seats so that the voting process can proceed in an \r\norderly manner. I should also like to remind delegations \r\nto refrain from extending congratulations in the General \r\nAssembly Hall right after the announcement of the \r\nelected members. This is disruptive to the distribution \r\nof ballot papers for any subsequent rounds of balloting. \r\nI thank all representatives for their cooperation.\r\nI would also like to remind members of the media \r\nnot to focus their cameras on delegations during the \r\nvoting process, taking into account that this is a secret \r\nballot in accordance with the rules of procedure of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I thank all representatives for their \r\ncooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Ballot \r\npapers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” will now be \r\ndistributed. Each ballot paper is assigned to one of the \r\nfive regional groups and has the corresponding number \r\nof blank lines for the seats assigned to that region.\r\nI request representatives to use only those ballot \r\npapers and to write on them the names of the States \r\nfor which they wish to vote. A ballot paper containing \r\nmore names from the relevant region than the number \r\nof seats assigned to it will be declared invalid. A ballot \r\npaper will also be declared invalid if none of the names \r\nof the Member States on that ballot belong to the \r\nrelevant region. If a ballot paper of a region includes \r\nboth the names of Member States that belong to and \r\nthat are from outside of that region, the ballot remains \r\nvalid, but only the names of the Member States that \r\nbelong to the relevant region will be counted. If a ballot \r\npaper contains names of Member States that are not \r\neligible for re-election or that are currently members of \r\nthe Council, the ballot remains valid but those names \r\nwill not be counted.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, Mr. Hajiyev \r\n(Azerbaijan), Ms. Mosli (Brunei Darussalam), \r\nMiss Johnson (Jamaica), Mrs. Oanţă (Romania), \r\nMs. Lyngdorf (Sweden) and Mr. Katota (Zambia) \r\nacted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.55 a.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:  0\r\n4/5 15-33818\r\nA/70/PV.42 28/10/2015\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nTogo  189\r\nEthiopia  186\r\nCôte d’Ivoire  186\r\nKenya  180\r\nBurundi  162\r\nUganda  12\r\nCameroon  2\r\nBenin  1\r\nLesotho  1\r\nGroup B — Asia-Pacific States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:  0\r\nNumber of members voting: 192\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMongolia  172\r\nUnited Arab Emirates  159\r\nKyrgyzstan  147\r\nRepublic of Korea  136\r\nPhilippines  113\r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic  105\r\nPakistan  105\r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea  1\r\nKazakhstan  1\r\nThailand  1\r\nGroup C — Eastern European States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  1\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  191\r\nAbstentions:  4\r\nNumber of members voting:  187\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSlovenia  179\r\nGeorgia  177\r\nRomania  1\r\nHungary  1\r\nGroup D — Latin American and Caribbean States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  192\r\nAbstentions:  0\r\nNumber of members voting:  192\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nPanama  157\r\nEcuador  152\r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)  131\r\nBahamas  113\r\nGroup E — Western European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  192\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 2\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  190\r\nAbstentions:  7\r\nNumber of members voting:  183\r\nRequired absolute majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSwitzerland  176\r\nGermany  174\r\nBelgium  172\r\nLuxembourg  1\r\nSweden 1\r\nThe Acting President: The following 18 States \r\nhave just been elected members of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for a three-year term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2016: Belgium, Burundi, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nEcuador, Ethiopia, Georgia, Germany, Kenya, \r\nKyrgyzstan, Mongolia, Panama, the Philippines, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, Slovenia, Switzerland, Togo, the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela.\r\nI congratulate those States that have been elected \r\nmembers of the Human Rights Council, and I thank the \r\ntellers for their assistance in this election.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded its consideration \r\nof sub-item (e) of agenda item 113.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to make the \r\nfollowing announcement concerning the work of the \r\nplenary.
