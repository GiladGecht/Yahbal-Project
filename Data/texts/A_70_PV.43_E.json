Over the past 70 years, the \r\nworld has undergone profound change. Challenges \r\nwe face today in preserving international peace and \r\nsecurity are increasingly complex and more numerous, \r\ninformed by greater interconnectivity and a series of \r\nnew and emerging threats.\r\nThose challenges require that the United Nations \r\norgan with the primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security be \r\nrepresentative, credible, efficient and effective. The \r\nOrganization on its seventieth anniversary requires that \r\nthe Security Council be capable of fully fulfilling its \r\nmandate in line with the spirit of the United Nations \r\nCharter. In this context, the need for Security Council \r\nreform is unquestionable. At the 2005 World Summit, \r\nleaders expressed support for reform to\r\n“make it more broadly representative, efficient \r\nand transparent and thus to further enhance its \r\neffectiveness and the legitimacy and implementation \r\nof its decisions” (resolution 60/1, para. 153).\r\nTen years have passed since the World Summit and \r\n50 years since the Security Council was last expanded \r\nto include additional non-permanent members. And \r\nduring the general debate and in my bilateral meetings \r\nin September, I was reminded of just how important \r\nthis topic continues to be for a large majority of the \r\nmembership as leaders expressed their concern about \r\nthe lack of progress and their hopes for the current \r\nnegotiations. At the same time, I understand that \r\ndiscussions on this subject are sensitive and difficult \r\nand that there are different positions among the \r\nmembership. I am keenly aware, therefore, that a matter \r\nof such importance requires a spirit of compromise \r\nfrom all.\r\nOn 14 September, the General Assembly decided \r\nto immediately continue the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform at the \r\nseventieth session (see A/69/PV.104), and, as I have said \r\non previous occasions, I intend to continue this process \r\nduring my tenure based on the decisions of the General \r\nAssemblyat its sixty-ninth session. With this in mind, I \r\nmoved last week to appoint Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, as the new \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations. I should like \r\nto thank Ambassador Lucas for taking up this important \r\nand difficult responsibility, and I call upon all Members \r\nto extend her their full support and cooperation. \r\nAmbassador Lucas succeeds Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, and \r\nI wish to thank Ambassador Rattray for his work in \r\nadvancing intergovernmental negotiations during the \r\nsixty-ninth session, culminating in a text and its annex, \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.43\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n43rd plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 30 October 2015, 10.30 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nwhich reflects the positions and proposals made by \r\nMember States.\r\nI am confident that the forthcoming intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations will build on the momentum and the \r\nprogress made during the sixty-ninth session, and \r\nI encourage all members to continue moving this \r\nreform process forward, pursuant to decision 69/560, \r\nin particular on the basis of the aforementioned text \r\nand annex circulated by my predecessor in his letter \r\ndated 31 July 2015. In this regard, it is critical that the \r\nnegotiations avoid a mere repetition of previously stated \r\npositions, a dynamic that has characterized this process \r\nin the past. Instead, I encourage members to work \r\nwith Ambassador Lucas to build on the progress made \r\nduring last session’s intergovernmental negotiations \r\nand to advance text-based negotiations.\r\nOf course, the success or otherwise of this process \r\nrests firmly with the Member States, but it is my hope \r\nthat today’s debate can serve as a useful foundation for \r\nfurther reform and can galvanize effective negotiations \r\nover the coming months. \r\nTo conclude, let me wish all participants productive \r\ndiscussions today and throughout this session. I stand \r\nready and available to provide whatever support is \r\nrequired to Ambassador Lucas and to all others as they \r\nseek to preserve the legitimacy of the Organization and \r\nto secure the effective functioning of one of its most \r\nimportant organs.\r\nMr. Minah (Sierra Leone): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the African Union \r\nmember States. \r\nI thank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s \r\ndebate on agenda item 121, on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and related matters.\r\nI would like to thank and congratulate our colleague \r\nAmbassador Lucas for taking up the appointment of \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations. We are \r\nready to work with her and look forward to hearing her \r\nideas on how she intends to guide our work. I would \r\nalso like to thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica and outgoing \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations, for the \r\ntremendous work and progress made during the sixty-\r\nninth session, under the inspired leadership of President \r\nSam Kutesa.\r\nAt the outset I should like to reiterate Africa’s \r\ncontinued commitment to this very important item. \r\nWe will work with all delegations and with you, \r\nMr. President, and the new Chair to ensure that our \r\ndeliberations, in accordance with General Assembly \r\ndecision 62/557, are not only favourable to the Common \r\nAfrican Position but also achieve our common objective.\r\nWe were heartened during the Assembly’s general \r\ndebate, when many Heads of State and Government \r\nreaffirmed the need to reform the Security Council \r\nin order to make it broadly representative, efficient \r\nand transparent and also to enhance its effectiveness, \r\nlegitimacy and the implementation of its decisions. We \r\nremain committed to decision 62/557 and subsequent \r\ndecisions. We hope that an acceptable outcome on the \r\nreform issue will be forthcoming during this session. \r\nWe have continued to express our position in all \r\nprevious intergovernmental negotiations meetings, \r\nincluding also populating the framework document \r\nthat was circulated by the President of the sixty-ninth \r\nsession on 31 July. Our participation in the current \r\nsession of intergovernmental negotiations is firmly \r\nanchored on that platform.\r\nGoing forward, the African Union Committee \r\nof Ten on Security Council Reform remains actively \r\nengaged in holding consultations with all member \r\nStates, delegations and groups and remains open to new \r\nideas and new initiatives on the question of reform of \r\nthe Security Council. It is common knowledge that the \r\nCommon African Position has gained momentum and \r\ncontinues to receive support in these deliberations for \r\nAfrica’s legitimate claim for permanent membership \r\nin the Security Council, and to correct its under-\r\nrepresentation in the non-permanent category. Our \r\nclaim is based on an historical injustice, and we hope \r\nthat it will be addressed without further delay. Further \r\ndelay continues to perpetuate the injustice and also \r\nprevents Africa from taking its rightful place in the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThere are several contentious elements on this issue \r\nof reform. One concerns the question of the veto. As we \r\nhave said before and will continue to repeat, Africa’s \r\npreferred position is for the abolition of the veto, but \r\nif it continues to exist it must be extended to all new \r\npermanent members. We call for its abolition but are \r\nprepared to work with other delegations to see how \r\nthere could be a possible limitation on the veto.\r\n15-34211 3/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\nWe are of the view that the only solution that could \r\nbe worthwhile on the question of Security Council \r\nreform is that which garners the widest possible \r\nacceptance, which will also allow a text to emerge \r\nand evolve during this session in an open, transparent, \r\ninclusive, balanced and comprehensive membership-\r\ndriven manner. We are willing and able to work with \r\nall delegations to achieve this objective.\r\nOn the question of whether the African position \r\nis a take-it-or-leave-it position, we prefer to reserve \r\nour comments on this issue in the format of formal \r\nnegotiations, which we hope will commence soon. Any \r\npermanent seat that we are awarded, of course, will be \r\nheld in accordance with the Charter. Our permanent \r\nseats and non-permanent seats will of course rotate as \r\nper the usual practice. At the appropriate time, Africa \r\nwill select its candidates for the non-permanent seats in \r\na manner of its choosing and will also, in keeping with \r\nthe relevant Charter provisions, make that known to all.\r\nWe call on and urge all delegations and interest \r\ngroups to pledge themselves to a new commitment to \r\naction. In other words, let us build on the work and the \r\nachievements of the last session and move from there \r\nto real negotiations and, hopefully, to a conclusion that \r\nwe can all live with. This session needs to build on the \r\ndramatic and unexpected progress made during the \r\nlast session, as well as to increase the pace for more \r\nfrank and lively debate on this issue. We feel that is the \r\nonly way the necessary political will, will lead to the \r\nmuch-needed and much-delayed reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. The vision of our leaders at the 2005 World \r\nSummit has been much delayed, and we hope that with \r\nyour help, Mr. President, we can all realize it in the not \r\ntoo distant future.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council, as we all know, \r\nlies at the very core of the need to ensure that the United \r\nNations remains at the heart of global governance \r\nand is also the key element in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. We wish to reiterate \r\nthat the regrettable status quo continues to undermine \r\nthe principles of equity, legitimacy, accountability \r\nand transparency in the work of the Security Council. \r\nIt also undermines the Council’s effectiveness in its \r\npursuit and stewardship of international peace and \r\nsecurity. Therefore we affirm our commitment to the \r\nreform process and urge the membership as a matter of \r\npriority to move not only to correct the injustice done to \r\nAfrica, but also to make sure that the Council is indeed \r\ntruly reflective of the modern era we live in.\r\nFinally, we wish to assure you, Mr. President, of \r\nour continued support and constructive participation \r\ntowards the early attainment of our common goal in \r\nreforming the Security Council. We assure all concerned \r\nthat we will push and move for a truly interactive and \r\nproductive session.\r\nMr. Talbot (Guyana): In today’s debate on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council, I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the States members of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nAt the outset, Mr. President, CARICOM \r\nacknowledges your commitment to this issue, as \r\ndemonstrated by the convening of today’s debate and \r\nyour letter of 23 October, through which you announced \r\nthe appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, as Chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. CARICOM \r\nhas every confidence that with her vast experience, \r\nincluding as her country’s representative on the Security \r\nCouncil just recently, Ambassador Lucas will be able to \r\nadd value to the process, building on the valuable work \r\nof the sixty-ninth session. CARICOM offers her its full \r\nsupport.\r\nIn this connection, we take the opportunity to \r\npay tribute to your predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nfor his tenacious leadership and commitment to this \r\nissue and for reinvigorating the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on reform of the Security Council during \r\nthe sixty-ninth session. We also express our sincere \r\nappreciation to Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, for his effective \r\nstewardship of the intergovernmental negotiations. His \r\nleadership and commitment have brought the process \r\nto an important stage and provided us with a workable \r\nnegotiating text.\r\nDespite the acknowledged differences on this \r\nimportant subject, this seventieth session presents us, \r\nas States Members of the United Nations, with a fresh \r\nopportunity to advance the deliberations on reform \r\nof the Security Council. With the consensus adoption \r\nof decision 69/560, the General Assembly now has a \r\nmandate to move the process forward by building on the \r\ninformal meetings held during the sixty-ninth session, \r\nas well as on the positions of and proposals by Member \r\nStates as reflected in the text and its annex circulated by \r\nMr. Kutesa via a letter of 31 July 2015. It is therefore our \r\nexpectation that the set text will be the working basis \r\n4/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nof the next round of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nallowing for real give-and-take negotiations in which \r\npositions merge, gaps are narrowed and areas of \r\ncommonalities are used as building blocks towards the \r\ncommon objective of a reformed Security Council. We \r\nanticipate in this process that further and new ideas and \r\nproposals may emerge to enrich our deliberations.\r\nFor its part, CARICOM has remained steadfast in \r\nsupport of the reform of the Security Council over many \r\nyears, including throughout the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Our delegations are committed to \r\nplaying a constructive role in the process. CARICOM \r\nmaintains a principled advocacy for expansion in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership. The role and security of small States are \r\nkey factors for CARICOM. In this context, we have \r\nproposed the inclusion of a special seat for small island \r\ndeveloping States in the reformed Security Council.\r\nThe region’s support for the inclusion of Africa and \r\nother developing countries in the permanent category \r\nof membership remains unwavering. With regard to the \r\nveto, CARICOM continues to call for the elimination \r\nof the veto. However, in the event of its retention, we \r\nconsider that all permanent members of a reformed \r\nSecurity Council should have the same rights and \r\nprerogatives.\r\nIn conclusion, let me assure you, Mr. President, \r\nof the full support of CARICOM delegations as you \r\nseek to advance the important cause of reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMs. Rambally (Saint Lucia): I have the honour \r\nto take the f loor today on behalf of a diverse group of \r\n42 developing countries from Africa, Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean, and Asia and the Pacific, who are \r\nunited by a common cause — to achieve lasting and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council. Our \r\ngroup is bound by the firm conviction that expansion \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nof membership of the Security Council is imperative to \r\nbetter reflect contemporary world realities and achieve \r\na more accountable, representative, transparent and, \r\nimportantly, relevant Security Council.\r\nWe would like to begin by congratulating you, \r\nMr. President, on commencing this process in earnest \r\nin your letter of 23 October 2015. We welcome the \r\nappointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg, as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We are confident that \r\nAmbassador Lucas will successfully steer the process \r\nforward pursuant to the Assembly’s consensus decision \r\n69/560 of 14 September, which fundamentally set the \r\nSecurity Council reform process on a negotiation path \r\nbased on the text and its annex circulated by then \r\nPresident of the General Assembly in his letter of \r\n31 July 2015.\r\nAs a leading pro-reform group, the L.69 was one \r\nof the first groups to request early commencement of \r\ntext-based negotiations through the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process. We are therefore extremely \r\nheartened to note the progress achieved in the previous \r\nround through a consultative, transparent and inclusive \r\nprocess which is now being carried forward in the \r\nAssembly’s seventieth session. It is also a significant \r\nstep forward that all Member States unanimously \r\nadopted decision 69/560, which is substantive and calls \r\nfor building upon the text of 31 July and its annex.\r\nIt is therefore important in this next round of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations that we commence the \r\nprocess from where we left off in the previous round. \r\nWe are now eager to engage in the actual negotiations \r\non this text in the same manner as we negotiate texts \r\nelsewhere in the United Nations. All of us are party \r\nto both the General Assembly rules of procedure and \r\nthe specific General Assembly resolution regulating \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform.\r\nThe L.69 group of developing countries would \r\nalso like to place on record its appreciation to the \r\noutgoing Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nAmbassador Courtenay Rattray, for having steered this \r\nprocess successfully, leading to the consensus decision \r\nadopted at the sixty-ninth session.\r\nIn recent years, we have all asked the Chair to \r\nproduce a negotiation text, but we have never got \r\none. Finally, with the adoption of decision 69/560 we \r\nknow that we have in place a text that is recognized \r\nundisputedly by the entire membership. Now, therefore, \r\nit becomes critical that we move further ahead with a \r\nresults-based time line as an absolute imperative. The \r\nL.69 group is fully committed and will constructively \r\nengage in the intergovernmental negotiations process, \r\nbuilding further on the Assembly President’s negotiation \r\ntext of 31 July. The objective is to move forward \r\ndecisively during the ongoing seventieth session.\r\nThe commitment of the L.69 group is to engage in \r\na process that would yield results. However, we wish \r\nto place on record that should this process not move \r\n15-34211 5/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\nforward with the negotiation text as referenced by \r\ndecision 69/560, then we are prepared to look at other \r\noptions that would yield the results desired by the vast \r\nmajority of the United Nations membership. \r\nThis seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\nis an important opportunity to show decisive progress \r\nand finally deliver a decision mandated by our Heads \r\nof State and Government at the 2005 World Summit: to \r\nachieve lasting reforms of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Cardi (Italy): On behalf of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus (UfC) group, I wish to thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this annual debate on \r\nSecurity Council reform and to warmly welcome \r\nthe appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas of \r\nLuxembourg to her new, pivotal capacity. We are \r\nconfident that she will be attentive to the needs and \r\nconcerns of all Member States to facilitate our collective \r\nendeavour in the coming months. Allow me also to \r\nthank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica for \r\nhis efforts during the past negotiating session.\r\nWe believe that the sixty-ninth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly can be seen as a step forward on our \r\npath towards reform in terms of active participation \r\nby an increasing number of Member States. Countries \r\nthat in the past had been on the margins of the debate \r\ndecided to engage and to spell out their positions on the \r\nfuture of the Security Council. In our view, this is a \r\nmaterial legacy. Our debate needs to be more inclusive, \r\njust as the Council we are striving to reform.\r\nSimilarly, we need full transparency. The \r\nintergovernmental negotiations are a membership-\r\ndriven process, mandated by Assembly decision \r\n62/557. We need predictability through a clear agenda, \r\nnot arbitrary guidance. Member States should be \r\nfacilitated in their work through timely information \r\nand extensive consultation. Each Member State, \r\nbelonging to any negotiating group, has the right to be \r\nadequately informed about the procedure. The past has \r\ndemonstrated that divisive approaches and initiatives \r\ncomplicate our process even further, distancing us from \r\nreaching our commonly shared goal of reform.\r\nThe UfC group has been tirelessly advocating \r\na deeper discussion of the principles on which the \r\nCouncil’s reform must be based. Clarifying how \r\nwe conceive the reform is a crucial undertaking that \r\nwould facilitate negotiations. Proof of this was given \r\nto us by the negotiations on the method of selection \r\nand appointment of the Secretary-General under last \r\nyear’s annual resolution on the revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly (resolution 69/321). \r\nThe collectively shared principle of a more transparent \r\nselection process was spontaneously translated into \r\nsome concrete measures. We knew with clarity where \r\nwe were heading so we achieved most of the expected \r\nresults in only one year of work.\r\nWe have all been talking for years about the \r\ncommon goal of a more representative, democratic, \r\naccountable and effective Security Council, but do we \r\nreally agree on the meaning of these principles? Let me \r\ngive a concrete example. Exactly one week ago, most of \r\nus attended the launch of a code of conduct supported \r\nby more than 100 countries, aimed at limiting the use of \r\nthe veto and preventing Council inaction, thus making \r\nit more effective in the face of heinous international \r\ncrimes. However, today we will still hear voices in \r\nfavour of adding new national permanent members, so \r\nnew veto powers, all while pursuing the same goal of \r\nmaking the Council more effective.\r\nThe Uniting for Consensus group has been very \r\nforthcoming in clarifying how we interpret the reform \r\nprinciples that I have just mentioned. The UfC has \r\nalready tackled the issue, most recently last year at the \r\ngeneral debate and throughout the entire work session. \r\nToday, as a further contribution to the debate on the \r\nobjectives of reform and to give substance to it, I would \r\nlike to touch on an increasingly recurrent issue: the \r\nrequest for a Security Council that is representative of \r\nthe realities of the twenty-first century. That is certainly \r\nan important concept because it suggests that Security \r\nCouncil reform should be reflective of the changes that \r\nhave occurred in the last 70 years. Let me summarize \r\nthe three main changes that have taken place.\r\nFirst, in these 70 years not only has the number of \r\nMember States grown, but the relative weight of the \r\ndifferent regional groups of the United Nations has also \r\nchanged. That has led the membership to unanimously \r\nrequest an enlargement of the Council to favour areas \r\nthat to date have been disadvantaged in the distribution \r\nof seats. The response of Uniting for Consensus to this \r\nfirst trend is unequivocal. We support an enlargement of \r\nthe Council up to 26 members, assigning the majority of \r\nadded seats to Africa, the Asia-Pacific region and Latin \r\nAmerica. We also understand and heed the call of the \r\nEastern European Group and of cross-cutting groups \r\nof States, such as small island developing States, small \r\nStates and the Arab countries.\r\n6/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nSecondly, some Member States aspire to play a \r\nmore prominent role in the Council. The UfC highly \r\nvalues the contribution that these States may offer to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nNo one has asked them to forfeit their willingness to \r\nplay a greater role in the Council. In fact, our proposal \r\nof longer-term seats with the possibility of immediate \r\nre-election was conceived precisely to meet these \r\nexpectations. Let me clarify: these seats would not be \r\nreserved for a select group of countries. All Member \r\nStates willing to make a bigger contribution to the work \r\nof the Security Council would have the right to run for a \r\nlonger-term seat. Our proposal is democratic in nature.\r\nThirdly, over the past 70 years we have experienced \r\nchange at an incessantly faster pace in the international \r\narena. The emergence of new regional actors and new \r\nglobal challenges imposes a modern vision for the \r\nSecurity Council, enhancing its f lexibility not only \r\nin terms of operations, but also in terms of its very \r\nstructure and representation. The reality of the twenty-\r\nfirst century is in continuous transformation, and a \r\nchanging reality requires a Council able to adapt to it. \r\nWe believe that regular elections are the best way to \r\nguarantee not only a truly democratic and accountable \r\nSecurity Council, but also a Council able to continually \r\nadapt to the rapid changes of today and tomorrow.\r\nThat is what we mean by an inclusive Security \r\nCouncil. Let us offer to all Member States — especially \r\nsmall States and developing countries, which represent \r\nthe majority of the membership — the opportunity \r\nto contribute more to the Council’s work. This goal \r\ncan be achieved solely by ensuring a proper, fair and \r\ndemocratic system, through regular elections. That is \r\nwhat we mean by a Security Council in tune with the \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century — a new, modern \r\nCouncil grounded on a profoundly democratic vision \r\nthat carries within it inclusiveness and adaptability.\r\nThat is the path towards the early reform that our \r\nleaders called for more than 10 years ago — a reform \r\nthat can be attained with no further delay, building on \r\nthe many already existing convergences among Member \r\nStates; a comprehensive reform of the Security Council \r\nthat can be concretely achieved by enlarging the Council \r\nwith new elected members and by a more balanced and \r\nequitable representation of regional groups. Other areas \r\nthat require our due attention.include an enhanced and \r\ncloser relationship between the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly; and improved working methods \r\nof the Council, including the question of the veto are \r\nalso\r\nThis is also the path towards a consensual reform \r\nof the Security Council that, due to its paramount \r\nimportance, must be endorsed by all Member States. The \r\nUniting for Consensus group stands ready to cooperate \r\nwith you, Sir, the new intergovernmental negotiations \r\nChair, and the entire membership to advance this \r\nprocess in good faith and in mutual respect, being \r\nguided by our strong conviction that a truly democratic \r\nSecurity Council reform is possible and within reach.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I have the \r\nhonour to make this statement on behalf of the Group \r\nof Arab States. \r\nI would like to convey to you, Mr. President, the \r\nsupport of the Arab Group in the work of the General \r\nAssembly at this session. I also wish to thank Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica, for his work during the previous session. \r\nWe welcome the appointment of Ms. Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg as Chair of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We wish her every success and assure her of \r\nour full cooperation.\r\nThe international community is seeing increasing \r\nchanges. We need to step up our efforts to strengthen \r\nthe role of the Security Council so that it will be \r\nmore effective and able to meet its challenges, more \r\nrepresentative, transparent, neutral and credible. \r\nThe reform of the Security Council and equitable \r\nrepresentation thereon is one of the crucial pillars of \r\nthe overall reform of the United Nations. More than \r\n20 years of discussions on expanding the Council \r\nand improving its working methods have seen many \r\ninternational and regional initiatives crop up, including \r\nthose of the Arab Group. \r\nBut now, seventy years after the establishment of \r\nthe United Nations and with the change in international \r\nrealities, it is extremely important to make progress in \r\nreforming the Council, in the context of the unanimity \r\nof Member States on the need for change. However, \r\nwe must not seek a hasty solution on which there is no \r\nconsensus, nor must we have a deadline that would block \r\na comprehensive solution to reform. In this regard, we \r\nreaffirm our stance that intergovernmental negotiations \r\nare the only forum in which to achieve an agreement on \r\nexpansion in line with Assembly decision 62/557. That \r\n15-34211 7/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\nis the basis for these negotiations, stipulating that they \r\nbe owned by the Member States.\r\nRecent developments in intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations have proved the need for greater clarity \r\nin the process of the negotiations so as to bolster \r\nconfidence and avoid divisions among the Members \r\nof the United Nations. In our opinion, this requires \r\nefforts during this session to achieve an agreement on \r\nthe principles and rules governing reform with respect \r\nto the five key issues set out in decision 62/557 so as \r\nto ensure clarity and transparency in the negotiations \r\nbefore we move on to substantial matters. We must \r\nbear in mind all proposals and positions put forward by \r\nMember States regarding the expansion and reform of \r\nthe Council. That must take place with the agreement \r\nof Member States and groups of States that present their \r\nproposals. We are fully confident that these very clear \r\npoints will guide Ambassador Lucas in her efforts as \r\nChair of the negotiations during the seventieth session \r\nto achieve consensus on how to move forward.\r\nThe Arab Group is aware of the importance of \r\nthe five key issues of Security Council reform in the \r\ncontext of a global vision of a solution that would enjoy \r\nmajority agreement. To this end, we draw attention \r\nto the role of the General Assembly, which has many \r\nroles to play at many different levels, including making \r\nrecommendations to the Security Council on matters \r\npertaining to international peace and security, pursuant \r\nto Article 11 of the Charter of the United Nations. There \r\nis therefore a need to bear in mind the complementary \r\nrelationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council so as to guarantee a balance between \r\nthese two bodies. \r\nWe highlight the fact that the use by the Council’s \r\nfive permanent members of their right of veto has on \r\nmore than one occasion eroded the Council’s credibility \r\nand paralysed its decision-making ability. It has also \r\nprevented necessary measures being taken to promote \r\nand protect international peace and security. \r\nFurthermore, the Council’s procedures and working \r\nmethods must be made more efficient and transparent.\r\nThe position of the members of the League of \r\nArab States on Security Council reform is to ask for \r\npermanent Arab representation on the Council, enjoying \r\nall prerogatives when the Security Council is expanded. \r\nWe would ask for proportional representation for Arab \r\nStates with respect to non-permanent membership. We \r\nmust not set an artificial deadline that might hamper a \r\nglobal solution to the question of reform. We are willing \r\nto cooperate positively on this during the seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Braun (Germany): I have the honour to take \r\nthe f loor today on behalf of the Group of Four (G-4) to \r\nconvey a two-fold message of gratefulness and urgency.\r\nFirst, I should like to express our gratitude to you, \r\nMr. President, for your commitment to moving the \r\nprocess of Security Council reform forward during \r\nyour term in office. We hope there will be substantial \r\nprogress during this seventieth session, based on the \r\nlegacy of former Assembly President Sam Kutesa and \r\nthe former Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nCourtenay Rattray, who led a transparent, inclusive and \r\nopen process. Let me express our thanks and our explicit \r\nrespect to Ambassador Rattray at this point. As for your \r\nefforts during the seventieth session, Mr. President, \r\nplease be assured of our full support.\r\nAs expressed in the many debates and events in \r\nrecent weeks, there is growing support among the \r\nMembers of the United Nations for a structural reform \r\nof the Security Council. At the same time, on the \r\noccasion of the seventieth anniversary, we hear growing \r\ncriticism directed at the Council for being unable to \r\ntake decisions concerning some of the most pressing \r\nsituations in international security.\r\nAs was pointed out during the open debate in \r\nthe Security Council on 20 October (see S/PV.7539), \r\nimprovement of the Council’s working methods is \r\ncrucial. However, it cannot be a substitute for the \r\nurgently needed structural reform of the Council. We, \r\nthe G-4, along with many more Member States, are \r\nconvinced that a more representative, legitimate and \r\neffective Security Council is needed more than ever \r\nin order to address the global conflicts and crises that \r\nhave multiplied in recent years. We share the view that \r\nthis can be achieved only by reflecting the reality of the \r\nworld in the twenty-first century, when more Member \r\nStates have the capacity and willingness to take on \r\nthe crucial responsibility of maintaining international \r\npeace and security. Inclusiveness is the key phrase, and \r\nhere I direct my view to Africa first and foremost.\r\nThe roll-over decision 69/560 of 14 September \r\nstipulates that the General Assembly must immediately \r\ncontinue intergovernmental negotiations based on \r\nthe text presented by its President at the sixty-ninth \r\nsession in his letter dated 31 July 2015. That was a \r\nveritable milestone for all those in favour of a more \r\n8/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nrepresentative, more legitimate and more effective \r\nSecurity Council. Nearly 120 delegations contributed \r\nactively to the framework document that will serve as \r\nthe vantage point for text-based negotiations during the \r\nupcoming round of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWe cannot afford to lose the newly gained \r\nmomentum. Leadership of the process will be crucial \r\nduring the stage that lies ahead during this seventieth \r\nsession. We therefore commend you, Mr. President, \r\nfor having appointed Ms. Sylvie Lucas as the new \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations to steer \r\nthis process leading to a resolution reflecting the \r\nresults of these negotiations. We are fully confident \r\nthat Ambassador Lucas will advance the process \r\nand bring it to a successful conclusion accepted by \r\nthe wide majority of Members. The past session of \r\nthe General Assembly was procedural in nature with \r\nrespect to the intergovernmental negotiations. Based \r\non the results achieved during that session, we expect \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations to produce progress \r\nin substance under the new Chairperson during this \r\nseventieth session.\r\nIn conclusion, let me also mention that we would \r\nwelcome more continuity in the Chairperson’s office to \r\nensure the smooth continuation of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process and to avoid the kind of undue \r\ndisruption that we have witnessed recently.\r\nMr. Sauer (Finland): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Nordic countries: Denmark, Iceland, \r\nNorway, Sweden, and my own country, Finland. \r\nFirst, let me commend you, Mr. President, for your \r\ncommitment to this important topic. We firmly believe \r\nthat it is possible to move forward in reforming the \r\nSecurity Council under your able leadership. Reform \r\nis long overdue. We have the responsibility to fulfil \r\nthe promises made by our leaders at the World Summit \r\n10 years ago.\r\nAllow me to congratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, on her \r\nappointment as the new Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Let me assure her of the full support of \r\nthe Nordic countries in the upcoming negotiations. We \r\nlook forward to engaging in the process actively and \r\nconstructively, based on decision 69/560.\r\nI should also like to pay tribute to Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for \r\nleading the informal consultations during the sixty-\r\nninth session and for his tireless efforts to push forward \r\nthe complicated and sensitive quest of Security Council \r\nreform. We welcome the much-needed dynamic his \r\nstewardship brought to the process.\r\nWe look forward to making tangible progress \r\nduring this session of the General Assembly under \r\nyour guidance, Sir. Let me underline that the Nordic \r\ncountries will remain fully committed to Security \r\nCouncil reform in order to address better and more \r\neffectively the urgent global challenges of today and \r\ntomorrow.\r\nMr. Lamek (France) (spoke in French): First, I \r\nwould like to welcome the appointment of Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas as facilitator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We know \r\nthat we can count on her dynamism and experience to \r\nmake real progress towards far-reaching reform of the \r\nCouncil. France will fully support her to ensure that \r\nshe is successful.\r\nGeneral Assembly discussions on Security Council \r\nreform have gone on for almost two decades. We must \r\nrecognize that we have not yet reached a conclusion on \r\nthe matter. Nonetheless, with Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray at its helm — whose outstanding work and \r\nconsultative and inclusive methods I commend — the \r\nwork undertaken during the Assembly’s sixty-ninth \r\nsession produced an initial outcome that was supported \r\nby the vast majority of Member States. France hopes \r\nthat the outcome of this work will serve as a basis \r\nfor the next cycle of intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nto be held during this session, in line with decision \r\n69/560,  which the Assembly adopted by consensus on \r\n14 September. We now need to start negotiating a text \r\nas soon as possible on this basis. We are counting on the \r\nnew facilitator to strive to that end.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of our Organization \r\nmust serve as an opportunity for Member States to \r\nfinally reach agreement on far-reaching reform. This is \r\nan historic opportunity to show that the United Nations \r\nis far from being fossilized and is able to reform itself. \r\nThis reform is fundamental. The Security Council must \r\nbetter reflect the reality of today’s world. Its reform is \r\ncrucial to bolstering the prestige and representativeness \r\nof our collective security system, while preserving its \r\nexecutive and decision-making nature.\r\nFrance’s position on this issue is well known. We \r\nwant the Security Council to take into consideration \r\nthe emergence of new Powers that have the resolve and \r\nability to shoulder the responsibility of a permanent \r\n15-34211 9/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\npresence in the Security Council and that are, in line \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, able to make an \r\nimportant contribution to the work of the Council. To \r\nthat end, France supports the candidacies of Germany, \r\nBrazil, India and Japan as permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council, as well as a reinforced presence of \r\nAfrican countries as permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers.\r\nIn the same spirit of reform, France has proposed \r\nthat the five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil voluntarily and collectively suspend the use of \r\ntheir veto in cases of mass atrocities. This voluntary \r\nstep requires no revision of the Charter but a political \r\ncommitment. France has already made that commitment. \r\nThe President of the Republic clearly indicated it \r\nhere in this Hall on 28 September (see A/70/PV.13). \r\nThis is an extremely important decision on behalf of \r\ninternational security, peace and relegitimized and \r\nrenewed multilateralism. This initiative, which we have \r\nput forward together with Mexico, is now supported by \r\nsome 85 countries. Along the same lines, the code of \r\nconduct developed by the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group, which France supports, also \r\nenjoys very considerable support. \r\nBuoyed by this we positive trend, we hope that \r\nwe will be able to persuade other Member States,  in \r\nparticular the other permanent members of the Council, \r\nto join with us. It is in the common interest of all Member \r\nStates that the Security Council be able to carry out its \r\nmandate and play its full role, in particular when faced \r\nwith situations of mass atrocities. These initiatives \r\non the use of the right of veto are complementary to \r\nthe global reform of the Council, which France will \r\ncontinue to advocate. It behoves us all collectively to \r\nassume our responsibilities to develop the status quo in \r\nthe interests of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I thank you, \r\nMr. President, for the opportunity to offer some brief \r\nremarks on the topic of Security Council reform this \r\nyear.\r\nFirst, I should like to thank Ambassador Rattray, \r\nwho has steered the work in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in a skilful and effective way for the past \r\nyear. He has shown the resolve and courage necessary \r\nto make even one step forward towards a real process of \r\nnegotiation, in which we still do not find ourselves after \r\nseveral years. If we ever get to that point, Ambassador \r\nRattray will have made a very important contribution \r\nto that.\r\nSecondly, I should like to thank Ambassador Lucas \r\nfor taking on this role for the next session. We cannot \r\nthink of a better person to lead the negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform for the future, and we pledge \r\nour full support to her.\r\nWe have noted with concern over the past year the \r\nstrong resistance among a small number of Members to \r\nany real progress in the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\neven though the process we were engaged in was fully \r\ntransparent. We also note with concern the pressure \r\nexercised on the Chair in this respect, even though he \r\nled the work of the intergovernmental negotiations in a \r\nf lawless manner. If that trend were to continue, we would \r\nprobably have to question our ability and willingness to \r\nengage in these negotiations and consider alternative \r\nformats. It is our hope that this session will allow us, \r\nunder the leadership of Ambassador Lucas, to focus on \r\nthe substance of the issues under the strong leadership \r\nof the Chair, as is customary in this building.\r\nAs is well known, in our national capacity we \r\nmade an expansion proposal a number of years ago. \r\nLiechtenstein proposed the creation of a new category \r\nof seats that would be long-term — for example, 10 \r\nyears — and immediately renewable and would thereby \r\nallow States to serve permanently on the Security \r\nCouncil if the membership mandated them to do so. The \r\nproposal obviously would not lead to the creation of any \r\nnew veto rights and would be subject to a mandatory \r\nreview of all aspects of Security Council reform after a \r\ndefined period of time.\r\nIt is well known that my delegation is very strongly \r\ncommitted to the improvement of the working methods \r\nof the Security Council. We believe that this is an \r\nindispensable part of Security Council reform. There \r\nare obvious changes that would need to be made in the \r\nCouncil’s working methods if and when it is enlarged \r\nunder any enlargement model. Very obvious areas \r\nare the majority required for adoption of a resolution \r\nin the Council, as well as the Council presidency and \r\nits distribution in such a way that each State gets to \r\nserve in this capacity at least once during its Security \r\nCouncil term.\r\nIn the meantime, as has been the case over the past \r\n20 years, we look to the Security Council to change \r\nits working methods in its current composition. It is \r\nagainst that background that we were very happy on \r\nFriday to launch the code of conduct on voting in the \r\nSecurity Council on behalf of the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group. The code of \r\n10/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nconduct, now supported by 106 States, is a pledge to \r\ntake meaningful action in the Security Council to end \r\nand prevent atrocity crimes and to not vote against any \r\nmeaningful, credible proposals submitted to that end.\r\nWe are very grateful to all States that have pledged \r\ntheir support for the code of conduct. We ask all States \r\nto equally give their support to the political declaration \r\nproposed by France and we look forward to have \r\nadditional States joining the code of conduct.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation thanks you, Mr. President, \r\nfor convening today’s meeting. We welcome your \r\nappointment of Ambassador Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg, as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We encourage her to be objective and fair in \r\nher work, in accordance with the mandate of resolution \r\n62/557, to build bridges among Member States, and to \r\nhelp all Member States to narrow their differences and \r\nmake compromises on the issue of Council reform.\r\nSecurity Council reform bears on the common \r\ninterests of all Member States and the long-term \r\ninterests of the United Nations. China has always \r\nactively supported reasonable and necessary reform \r\nof the Council aimed at enhancing its efficiency and \r\nauthority, increasing the representation of and giving \r\na stronger voice to the developing countries, especially \r\nAfrican countries, and affording more opportunities \r\nto more countries, especially the small and medium-\r\nsized countries that account for the majority of the \r\nmembership to participate in the decisions of the \r\nSecurity Council and play a greater role.\r\nIn accordance with decision 62/557 and the \r\nconsensus of Member States, the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform should \r\nbe led by the Member States. China hopes that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform at the current session of the General Assembly \r\nwill turn over a new page, return to the correct, \r\nmembership-driven track, and build on the positions \r\ntaken, the proposals and suggestions put forward and \r\nthe efforts made by all countries since the launch of the \r\nnegotiations in 2009. \r\nWe hope that Member States will continue to \r\nparticipate constructively in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, seek a package solution through extensive \r\nand democratic consultations, and reach the broadest \r\npossible consensus. No artificial deadline should be \r\nset for reform, and no immature reform proposals \r\nshould be forcibly promoted. China would like to work \r\njointly with all countries to advance Council reform in \r\na direction that conforms to the common interests of \r\nall Member States and the long-term interests of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Bamrungphong (Thailand): As we celebrate \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations this \r\nyear, it is a good opportunity to remind ourselves \r\nthat the United Nations can only be as strong and as \r\neffective as Member States want and make it to be. The \r\nreform of the Security Council is no exception. It can be \r\npossible only if Member States are willing to be more \r\nf lexible and are prepared to engage in negotiations that \r\nare constructive, pragmatic and results-oriented.\r\nThe decision made at the last round of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations was a significant step \r\nin our collective efforts. The process leading up to it \r\nprovided us with an opportunity to exchange views in an \r\ninteractive, inclusive and transparent manner. I take this \r\nopportunity to express our appreciation to Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica, for his hard work and dedication throughout \r\nthe last round of the intergovernmental negotiations. We \r\nalso welcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as \r\nthe next Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations and \r\nwish her success in this very important responsibility. \r\nIn this regard, allow me to share the following views in \r\nthis debate. \r\nFirst, Thailand belongs to no specific group \r\nand has always been open to all ideas and proposals \r\non the expansion of membership of the Security \r\nCouncil, including the expansion of both categories \r\nor the introduction of interim or intermediate options. \r\nHowever, settling only the issue of expansion of \r\nmembership is far from adequate if the overall reform \r\nprocess is to be successful. Any expansion must take \r\ninto account a greater and more equitable regional \r\nrepresentation. Most importantly, it must prove to \r\nbe useful in enhancing the Council’s efficiency and \r\neffectiveness.\r\nSecondly, Thailand firmly believes that improvement \r\nin the working methods of the Security Council is \r\nnecessary for a more transparent and effective Council. \r\nImproving the working methods should be a continuing \r\nprocess and should not be held hostage to the overall \r\nreform of the Council. We welcome the Council’s \r\n15-34211 11/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\nongoing efforts to convene open debates and engage in \r\ninformative discussions on this subject.\r\nOn this note, we also welcome the ongoing \r\nefforts to strengthen the closer coordination and \r\ncollaboration between the Council and the General \r\nAssembly, two principal organs of the United Nations, \r\nin accordance with their respective mandates, through \r\nthe institutionalization of regular consultations \r\nbetween the Presidents of the two bodies. Interaction \r\nhelps to ensure transparency in the deliberations of \r\nthe Council. Thailand believes that the Council can be \r\ntransparent only if it is accessible. In this regard, we \r\nurge members of the Council to continue to engage the \r\nwider membership of the United Nations, particularly \r\non issues with broader impact and complexity.\r\nThirdly, we firmly believe that the principle of \r\naccountability should guide the work of the Council’s \r\nmembers, permanent and elected alike. The world \r\nneeds a Council that can act together in a decisive, \r\nresponsible and timely manner to stop genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity or war crimes. Countries on the \r\nSecurity Council, especially the permanent members, \r\nhave a heavy responsibility to humankind. They must \r\ntherefore demonstrate greater leadership and political \r\nwill to take decisive action against such vast scale \r\nhumanitarian catastrophes resulting from conflicts.\r\nFor this reason, Thailand supports the two initiatives \r\nthat are on the table: the suspension of the veto in case of \r\nmass atrocities, put forward by France and Mexico, and \r\nthe code of conduct regarding Security Council action \r\nagainst genocide, crimes against humanity and war \r\ncrimes, put forward by the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group.\r\nWe have come a long way since 1946, when there \r\nwere only 11 members on the Security Council. We \r\nmust take this opportunity to ensure that the important \r\nwork of the intergovernmental negotiations continues \r\nby building on the work done at the last session in a \r\nconsultative manner, while aiming at taking on board \r\nthe broadest participation possible. We look forward to \r\nparticipating in a constructive, substantive discussion \r\non the way forward for greater representation on \r\nand greater  credibility, legitimacy and, above all, \r\neffectiveness of the Security Council, and in the hope \r\nof seeing a clearer basis for the future progress of our \r\nwork.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The time has undoubtedly come for Security \r\nCouncil reform. The question is how to implement it \r\nso that it strengthens not only the Council itself but the \r\nOrganization as a whole. It is important to strive for \r\na final outcome that will truly help to strengthen the \r\nposition of developing States, which we support, and \r\nnot entrench current positions.\r\nWe congratulate the Permanent Representative \r\nof Luxembourg, Sylvie Lucas, on her appointment as \r\ncoordinator of the intergovernmental negotiations. We \r\ntrust that her work will help to establish a constructive \r\natmosphere for negotiations in order to find a \r\nmutually acceptable solution. We thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica for his \r\nwork in that post at the previous session of the General \r\nAssembly. We also wish to highlight the work of the \r\nformer Permanent Representative of Afghanistan Zahir \r\nTanin in that job over many years.\r\nRussia recognizes the need to make the Security \r\nCouncil more representative. However, efforts in \r\nthis area should not have an impact on the Council’s \r\nability to react swiftly and effectively to contemporary \r\nchallenges. In this context, we are in favour of retaining \r\nthe  compact character of the Council’s composition. \r\nThe optimal number of members of the Security \r\nCouncil should not exceed 20. That would guarantee \r\nfor non-permanent members an opportunityto preside \r\nover the Council. \r\nIt would be naïve to claim that the reformed and \r\nexpanded Council would easily find solutions to the \r\nproblems that the present Council has failed to address. \r\nPolitical contradictions would not simply disappear, \r\nwhile the work on the texts of decisions would only be \r\nfurther complicated. \r\nWe are not going to hide the fact that any idea \r\ntending to undermine the existing prerogatives of \r\nthe permanent members, including the right of veto, \r\nis unacceptable to us. We recall that this right is an \r\nimportant factor that helps members of the Council \r\nto strike balanced decisions. It is also important to \r\nunderstand that the right of veto protects not only the \r\ninterests of those who enjoy it, but also the interests of \r\nthe countries of a region that do not have the right of \r\nveto but in its absence would be vulnerable to pressure \r\nfrom well-known groups of States.\r\nDuring 11 rounds of intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform, Member States have \r\nmanaged to achieve something. Many aspects of the \r\nproblem have become clearer. However, a universal \r\n12/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\ndecision that would be satisfactory to everybody has \r\nnot yet appeared. We fully support the idea that the \r\nprocess of Security Council reform should be owned by \r\nevery single Member State and that its final outcome \r\nshould be supported as broadly as possible by Members \r\nof the Organization. \r\nWe are convinced that Security Council reform \r\ncannot be concluded arithmetically by calculating \r\ndifferent models of votes in order to seek the minimal \r\nnumber of votes. A result achieved that way would \r\nundoubtedly undermine the authority of the Council \r\nand would not strengthen the United Nations. Rather, \r\nit would do the opposite. We are therefore prepared to \r\nconsider any sensible option for expanding the Council, \r\nincluding interim provisions and compromise solutions, \r\nif it were to enjoy the broadest possible support within \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nFurthermore, the negotiations have revealed the \r\nprevalence of sometimes diametrically opposed \r\nopinions. We therefore see no alternative at this session \r\nof the General Assembly than to work carefully to bring \r\npositions closer together. We trust that the efforts of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and the negotiations \r\nfacilitator will help to achieve optimal agreement in the \r\nnegotiations, on the understanding that the ownership of \r\nthe process remains with the Member States. This work \r\nshould take place in a calm, transparent and inclusive \r\nenvironment without arbitrarily imposed deadlines \r\nor frenzied speculation. The matter of reforming any \r\ninstitution, let alone the most important, should not \r\ncomplicate the real work of our Organization, finding \r\nresponses to the numerous challenges facing humanity \r\ntoday.\r\nLet us not forget the most important thing. Progress \r\nin reforming the Security Council depends on the \r\npolitical resolve and readiness of Member States to \r\nfind a sensible compromise, and on that alone. In that \r\nregard. methodology is a secondary issue.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): My delegation aligns itself \r\nwith the statements made earlier by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Lucia on behalf of the L.69 \r\ngroup and the Permanent Representative of Germany \r\non behalf of the Group of Four.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to compliment you, \r\nMr. President, on convening this important debate \r\nunder agenda item 121, which has been a matter of \r\ndiscussion in the General Assembly for more than \r\ntwo decades, and ever since my country joined other \r\ndeveloping countries in September 1992 in submitting \r\nresolution 47/62. We note the significance of decision \r\n69/560, of 14 September 2015, which was adopted \r\nunanimously under the presidency of your predecessor, \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa. That has given us a negotiating text \r\nfor implementing the mandate our leaders adopted at \r\nthe World Summit of 2005 for early reforms of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe would like to acknowledge and compliment \r\nAmbassador Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica for having \r\nsuccessfully given our intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess the negotiating text of 31 July.\r\nWe are happy, Sir, to have received your letter of \r\n23 October informing us of your decision to appoint \r\na new chairperson for these negotiations during this \r\nhistoric seventieth session and for providing her with a \r\nclear mandate to conduct these negotiations on the basis \r\nof the text of 31 July, which was, we note, unanimously \r\nendorsed in decision 69/560. We are happy to share with \r\nthe General Assembly the common position adopted \r\nyesterday at the third India-Africa Forum Summit for \r\nearly implementation of decision 69/560 so as to make \r\na decisive push for achieving concrete outcomes on the \r\nreforms of the Security Council. \r\nWe commit ourselves at this meeting — which \r\nis the first time we are speaking on this issue at this \r\nsession — to work in good faith through the give and \r\ntake of negotiations with the Chairperson to reach our \r\ncommon objective of concrete outcomes during this \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We especially look \r\nforward to engaging with Member States that have \r\nexpressed important views this morning but have yet to \r\ncontribute to the 31 July text in this context. We would \r\nof course expect to apply the provisions of resolution \r\n53/30, of 23 November 1998, which we unanimously \r\nadopted and which sets a benchmark of a two thirds \r\nmajority for taking decisions on this important issue.\r\nWe note that an ineffective Security Council has \r\nentailed huge human, economic and environmental \r\ncosts in terms of wars and conflicts, which the \r\ninternational community cannot justify any longer. \r\nThe figures speak for themselves, but today we would \r\nlike to highlight especially the more than 60 million \r\npeople affected by these conflicts, which are due to \r\nthe malfunctioning of the Security Council. Given \r\nthat most of these conflicts are occurring in areas \r\nconsisting of  developing countries, we believe that a \r\ngreater representation of developing countries in both \r\n15-34211 13/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\ncategories of an expanded Security Council would help \r\nto address this problem urgently.\r\nWe would emphasize that our work cannot be seen \r\nin isolation. The very fact that our leaders unanimously \r\nadopted the most ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) to eradicate poverty \r\nfrom the face of the Earth within our generation gives \r\nour work a context and framework. The longer we delay \r\nin reforming the Security Council, the more pressure \r\nwe put on the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, \r\nespecially for developing countries.\r\nWe have two specific requests related to the process \r\nto make for consideration today. First, we would request \r\nthe announcement of a fixed schedule of meetings of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, beginning from \r\nearly next month, at a regular interval, to commence \r\ntext-based negotiations. All Member States should \r\nbe informed in advance of the frequency, agenda and \r\nschedule of these meetings. They should be, in our \r\nview, held at least once a week, given the urgency of \r\nthe subject.\r\nSecondly, we look forward to the circulation of a \r\ncommunication, under your authority, Mr. President, \r\nfrom the newly appointed Chairperson of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, conveying the agenda \r\nof each of these sessions of the seventieth session, which \r\nwould of course be based on the decision taken by the \r\nGeneral Assembly earlier on the five clusters. This \r\nwill help delegations obtain their updated negotiating \r\nmandates for the listed areas of negotiations in good \r\ntime.\r\nIn conclusion, I should like to reiterate what \r\nmy Prime Minister, Mr. Narendra Modi, said in his \r\nstatement to this Assembly last month: \r\n“We must also reform the United Nations, \r\nincluding the Security Council. That is essential if \r\nwe are to ensure that our institutions have greater \r\ncredibility and legitimacy. With a more broad-\r\nbased representation, we can be more effective in \r\nachieving our goals.” (A/70/PV.4, p. 18)\r\nMr. Wilson (United Kingdom): I pay tribute to the \r\nwork of your predecessor, Mr. President, and that of \r\nAmbassador Rattray over the past year. They brought \r\nmuch-needed energy and innovation to a debate which \r\nhas been dormant for too long. We know that you and \r\nAmbassador Lucas will approach reform of the Security \r\nCouncil with the same vigour. You can count on the \r\nsupport of the United Kingdom in your efforts, and I \r\nencourage all Member States to join us and give you \r\ntheir backing.\r\nAs my Foreign Secretary made clear when he \r\naddressed the General Assembly in September (see \r\nA/70/PV.18), the United Nations needs a reformed \r\nSecurity Council. Earlier this week, we celebrated the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the United Nations. In this \r\nmilestone year, we owe it to ourselves to make much-\r\nneeded progress in reforming the Security Council. We \r\nneed a Council which is representative of today’s world \r\nand able to respond effectively to the challenges that \r\nwe face.\r\nThe compilation text compiled by Ambassador \r\nRattray is a good start, and we look forward to \r\nbuilding on that work in the year ahead. The United \r\nKingdom’s own position on Security Council reform is \r\nclear. We support permanent representation for Brazil, \r\nIndia, Germany and Japan and permanent African \r\nrepresentation. When considering the overall size of \r\na reformed Council we must not reduce the Council’s \r\nability to act decisively when called upon to address \r\nthreats to international peace and security.\r\nThe United Kingdom will continue to advocate \r\nfor reform from within the Security Council so that it \r\nremains fit for purpose in the twenty-first century. We \r\nare proud to have been the first permanent member of \r\nthe Council to sign up to the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group’s code of conduct for the \r\nSecurity Council. In doing so, we have sent a clear \r\nmessage: the United Kingdom will never vote against \r\na credible Security Council draft resolution that seeks \r\nto prevent or respond to genocide, ethnic cleansing, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes. I hope all \r\nSecurity Council members, both present and future, \r\nwill join us in making that pledge.\r\nNext week the United Kingdom will assume \r\nthe presidency of the Security Council. We will \r\ndischarge our responsibilities in a transparent and \r\nefficient manner so that Council meetings are as open, \r\ninteractive and effective as possible. We will be ready \r\nto respond quickly to emerging or developing situations \r\nso that the Council is, and is seen to be, discharging its \r\nresponsibilities efficiently and effectively.\r\nI wish you, Sir, and Ambassador Lucas and all of us \r\nevery success in the year ahead.\r\nMs. Sison (United States of America): It is indeed \r\nappropriate for us to meet early in this new session of \r\nthe General Assembly to discuss the important issue \r\n14/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nof Security Council reform. My delegation welcomes \r\nthe chance to continue this essential discussion with the \r\nmembership.\r\nWe warmly welcome the appointment of Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We also wish to thank Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray for his strong leadership during his \r\ntenure.\r\nI hope that you, Mr. President, and the Chair, as \r\nwell as the wider membership here today, know that \r\nthe United States is committed to working with other \r\nMembers to achieve broad consensus on a reformed \r\nCouncil, a Council that reflects the realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century. As we have said before, the United \r\nStates is open to a modest expansion, in principle, in \r\nboth permanent and non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nWe do not support changes to the veto. We consider \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations to be the best forum \r\nfor advancing discussion on Security Council reform. \r\nWe believe that any approach to this issue should \r\nenhance the Council’s effectiveness and efficiency \r\nin carrying out the responsibilities conferred upon it \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nCouncil membership carries great responsibility. \r\nThus we believe that any consideration of an expansion \r\nof permanent members must take into account the \r\nability and willingness of countries to contribute to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security and to \r\nother purposes of the United Nations.\r\nWe look to engage with fellow Member States \r\non an intergovernmental negotiations process that \r\nis deliberate and inclusive, given the importance of \r\nSecurity Council reform, the complexity of the issues \r\nand the divergence of views among Member States. For \r\nany reform to be successful, it is crucial that proposals \r\nenjoy broad support among all Member States.\r\nWe note that some Member States have called for \r\nthe start of text-based negotiations. The United States \r\nis neutral on all manner of negotiation within the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations framework as long as \r\nit furthers the broad consensus that is needed to reach \r\ncomprehensive international agreement on Council \r\nreform. We are cognizant of the fact that differences of \r\nopinion remain on the text on which negotiations would \r\nbe based and that not all Member States have endorsed a \r\ncommon approach. The intergovernmental negotiations \r\nChair can certainly help steer this process, but general \r\nagreement on a common approach is crucial.\r\nWe believe the intergovernmental negotiations to \r\nbe the best forum for finding a comprehensive solution \r\nthat can generate the broadest support among Member \r\nStates. We pledge our support to Ambassador Lucas and \r\nto all Member States that seek constructive engagement \r\non Council reform.\r\nMr. Bodini (San Marino): I want to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, on the appointment of \r\nAmbassador Lucas as Chair of the Security Council \r\nreform intergovernmental negotiations. I take this \r\nopportunity to thank Ambassador Rattray for last \r\nyear’s contribution to this process.\r\nI am happy Ambassador Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of a small State, has been selected for \r\nthis important task. As is known, small States like \r\nSan Marino rely heavily on the United Nations and its \r\nvalues.\r\nOne of our greatest privileges is the right to vote, \r\nin particular for the elected members of the Security \r\nCouncil. The Council, at the core of the United \r\nNations system, needs to become more democratic, \r\naccountable and efficient. That is why San Marino \r\nseeks an enlarged —with  elected members only — and \r\ngeographically balanced Council. I am sure that under \r\nAmbassador Lucas’s stewardship the Council reform \r\nprocess will be predictable and transparent and involve \r\ngreat interaction among the Member States. I hope that \r\nat the end of this new round of negotiations we will \r\nreach a compromise solution among all Member States, \r\nfrom the five permanent members to a small country \r\nlike ours.\r\nI am afraid that there will be a terrible mistake if \r\nthis attempt brings us to a divisive vote. An issue of this \r\nimportance needs to find a solution with the consensus \r\nof a very large majority. This process requires standard \r\ndiplomatic skills. I am pleased Ambassador Lucas has \r\nalready shown a great ability in past negotiations.\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): I thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor convening this important debate. My delegation \r\nwould also like to congratulate Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, on \r\nher appointment as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations at the seventieth session.\r\nMy delegation notes that over the years, including at \r\nthe previous session of the General Assembly, Member \r\n15-34211 15/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\nStates continued to reaffirm their common desire and \r\naspiration for reforming the Security Council to make it \r\nmore inclusive, representative, legitimate, accountable \r\nand effective. Yet strong divergence persists on how to \r\nachieve the reform, and that has meant that this process \r\nhas hardly made meaningful progress up to today.\r\nRecently, during the high-level segment of thof the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the majority of leaders reiterated \r\ntheir call for Security Council reform. My delegation \r\nbelieves that to be testament to a growing, urgent need \r\nfor the Assembly to pursue tangible results in this \r\nregard.\r\nMy delegation recognizes that some aspects \r\nof Security Council reform are being addressed \r\nin parallel to and outside the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process. Just recently, more than 100 \r\ncountries — the majority of the entire membership of \r\nthe United Nations — joined ranks to propose a code \r\nof conduct aimed at limiting the use of the veto and \r\npreventing the Council’s inaction, and at making it \r\nmore effective in the face of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes. Similarly, no fewer than 80 \r\ncountries have extended their support to a political \r\ndeclaration with a similar purpose, namely, to restrain \r\nthe veto in situations of mass atrocities.\r\nIn the same vein, a step forward was recently taken \r\nin pushing the Security Council to increase closer \r\ncooperation with the General Assembly, in particular in \r\nthe process of the selection and appointment of the next \r\nSecretary-General. My delegation is indeed encouraged \r\nby this positive development.\r\nIn the light of those current developments on the \r\nissue at hand, my delegation is of the view that there \r\nare pertinent lessons that can be drawn from, and can \r\nserve as a catalyst for, our common undertaking in the \r\nSecurity Council reform process.\r\nFirst, political commitment at the highest level \r\nfrom Member States is important to sustain and further \r\nadvance this process. This process should also continue \r\nto be motivated and inspired by the expression of \r\ncommitment and determination made in various forums \r\noutside the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, progress can be made in an incremental \r\nmanner, as attested to on issues such as the use of the \r\nveto right. The same approach can also be applied to \r\npursue progress on other aspects of Security Council \r\nreform, including on the issue of membership expansion, \r\ncategories and size.\r\nWhile recognizing the validity of different \r\narguments and positions for pursuing expansion in the \r\nmembership of the Council, my delegation maintains \r\nits view that an incremental approach is the most \r\nfeasible way to make progress on the issue. A number \r\nof countries have proposed models for membership \r\nexpansion. Along with other reform issues, my \r\ndelegation is willing to explore them with an open mind \r\nin the coming sessions.\r\nMy delegation believes that this is in accordance \r\nwith what our leaders called for more than 10 years ago, \r\nan early and comprehensive reform of the Council that \r\ncan be concretely achieved by enlarging the Council \r\nwith new elected members, and addressing the issue \r\nof balance and equitable representation of different \r\nregional groups.\r\nThirdly, different tracks should be maintained \r\nand pursued in a synergized manner while at the same \r\ntime ensuring that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess remains the main deliberative mechanism on \r\nthe issue of Security Council reform. My delegation \r\nvalues the various ideas and initiatives that have been \r\ndeveloped by Member States in order to make progress \r\non specific aspects of Security Council reform, and \r\nis ready to continue its engagement in a constructive \r\nmanner.\r\nMy delegation also puts great emphasis on efforts \r\nto improve the working methods of the Council with \r\nthe purpose of enhancing its effectiveness, efficiency \r\nand accountability. In that connection, my delegation \r\nhighly values the recent Security Council open debate \r\non working methods (see S/PV.7539).\r\nTo ensure that the Security Council is fully enabled \r\nto perform its responsibilities — and its actions are \r\nowned by the wider Member States — my delegation \r\nbelieves that robust cooperation, communication, and \r\ngenuine consultation with and support from all Member \r\nStates are crucial.\r\nLastly, my delegation reaffirms its view that the \r\nissue of Security Council reform is not an isolated \r\nagenda. Instead, it is linked with other United Nations \r\nreform agendas, in particular the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe outcome of this reform will have great impact \r\non the continued relevance and legitimacy of the United \r\nNations in general before the global community. A \r\nnumber of unresolved conflicts and tensions in some \r\nparts of the world signify its shortcomings, which further \r\n16/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nundermines its recognized competence. Palestine and \r\nSyria are two glaring cases where a persistent lack of \r\naction by the Council has worsened the conditions of \r\nthe people and made the conflicts more intractable.\r\nIt is my delegation’s firm belief that we are now at \r\na critical juncture where we have to act and mobilize \r\na stronger common purpose for real change in the \r\nCouncil.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): Let me, at the outset, say \r\nhow pleased my delegation is to see you, Mr. President, \r\npresiding over the General Assembly during this \r\nlandmark seventieth year of the United Nations. You \r\ncan count on my country’s support in fulfilling your \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nPakistan fully associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Italy on behalf \r\nof the Uniting for Consensus group. I would also like \r\nto congratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg, on her appointment as \r\nthe new Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nPakistan assures her of its full cooperation.\r\nAssembly decision 62/557 provides the mandate \r\nfor the intergovernmental negotiations process. The \r\ngoal set was to achieve comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council on five equally important and \r\ninterlinked issues and to seek a solution that could \r\nenjoy the widest possible political acceptance. Success \r\nhas eluded us thus far because the focus has been on \r\nlooking for procedural shortcuts rather than on genuine \r\nefforts to bridge divergent positions on substance.\r\nWe can all agree that compromise and f lexibility \r\nare the keys to successful outcomes in multilateral \r\nnegotiations. In evaluating the lack of progress on \r\nSecurity Council reform, we have to acknowledge that \r\nthe absence of f lexibility and compromise is at the root \r\nof the impasse we face today.\r\nA few countries have sought to promote their self-\r\narrogated right to a privileged and unequal status, \r\nand they have maintained that rigid position since \r\nthe process began, about two decades ago. It is that \r\nrigidity that is the real reason for our persistent failure \r\nto achieve a more democratic, accountable, transparent \r\nand effective Security Council. For its part, the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group twice revised its proposal, and it \r\nremains ready to engage in further dialogue.\r\nThere is now a great deal of history to these \r\nnegotiations. But those who do not learn from history \r\nare condemned to repeat it. Two important lessons \r\nshould be kept in mind. First, quick fixes and procedural \r\nmanoeuvres have always come to nought, and secondly, \r\nno agreements are to be found at the extreme ends of \r\npolitical positions. An honest appraisal of those facts \r\nwill mark the first meaningful step towards reform of \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations are a \r\nmembership-driven process. The basis is the proposals \r\nand positions of Member States and negotiating groups. \r\nThis process needs to be facilitated in good faith and in \r\nan open, transparent, predictable and inclusive manner, \r\nthus creating an environment that preserves mutual \r\nrespect among Member States. \r\nLet me outline the basic precepts of our position on \r\nthe substance of Security Council reform.\r\nPakistan opposes the creation of new permanent \r\nseats, as it is contrary to the universally agreed \r\nprinciples of our time — democracy, accountability \r\nand transparency. The Security Council needs to be \r\nexpanded in the category of elected seats, allowing more \r\nrepresentation from Member States. This has become \r\nnecessary in view of the increase in United Nations \r\nmembership since the Council was last expanded, five \r\ndecades ago.\r\nOur goal is the democratization of the Council \r\nthrough a reform that promotes the interests and \r\naspirations of all Member States — small, medium-\r\nsized and large.\r\nAdditional elected members in the Council will also \r\nhave a positive impact on the Council’s accountability, \r\ntransparency and working methods. More elected \r\nmembers will enhance regional representation and \r\nownership, rendering the Council more legitimate.\r\nIt is often said that the Security Council needs to \r\nbe adapted to the realities of the twenty-first century to \r\nenhance the Council’s legitimacy and representativeness. \r\nWe agree, but some countries ignore what the objective \r\nrealities really are. They focus only on their narrow \r\nand contentious interpretation of political realities. \r\nThat, if I may say so, is an illusion, and there are strong \r\narguments against such an approach.\r\nFirst, States making that claim must know that \r\nmany medium-sized States compete with them in \r\nany criteria of qualification, and may even surpass or \r\noutpace them in the future.\r\n15-34211 17/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\nSecondly, there is no evidence to support the \r\nargument that more permanent seats will enhance \r\nthe legitimacy of the Council. To argue that more \r\npermanent seats will enhance the representativeness of \r\nthe Council is disingenuous for reasons I have already \r\ncited.\r\nThirdly, we need to carefully and soberly think \r\nwhether permanence is a solution to present-day \r\npolitical realities that are themselves transient. If the \r\npast has changed into the present, will the present not \r\nbe sure to change into the future? Will we then be \r\nlooking to continuously add more permanent members \r\nto the Security Council?\r\nFourthly, and most important, the objective \r\nrealities are in fact quite different. It is a fact that \r\nUnited Nations membership has increased almost \r\nfourfold since its inception. It is a fact that more than \r\none third of the United Nations membership has never \r\nhad an opportunity to serve on the Council. It is also a \r\nfact that all Member States want the Council to be more \r\ndemocratic and accountable. But more permanent seats \r\nare the antithesis of all those objective realities.\r\nPakistan distinguishes between the demands \r\nmotivated by selfish ambitions and the collective \r\ndemand of an entire continent. In that regard, we have \r\nalways respected and continue to respect the African \r\nCommon Position. Let me reiterate that only f lexibility \r\nand compromise will take us closer to our goal. Fixed \r\npositions will stall and hobble our efforts. Had there \r\nbeen f lexibility on the part of the delegations that have \r\nunjustifiably insisted on securing permanent seats, \r\nmany Member States would already have played a \r\npositive role in the Security Council. Together we would \r\nhave contributed to international peace and security.\r\nA week ago we celebrated the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations. The celebration was \r\nessentially and fundamentally about the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, which we all subscribe to and which \r\nlays strong emphasis on democracy and accountability. \r\nWe all pledged to respect and to promote it. We hope \r\nthat this pledge will translate into action and will yield \r\nprogress towards a reform of the Security Council that \r\nis rooted in the principles enshrined in the Charter.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): Let me thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening this important meeting. \r\nI start by saying that we align ourselves with the \r\nstatement delivered by Ambassador Harald Braun, \r\nPermanent Representative of Germany, on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Four, and with the intervention of Ambassador \r\nMenissa Rambally, Permanent Representative of Saint \r\nLucia on behalf of the L.69 group.\r\nI want to welcome the appointment of Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, \r\nas Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. Brazil \r\npledges its full support to Ambassador Lucas and her \r\nteam in this endeavour.\r\nAs reflected in Assembly decision 69/560, adopted \r\nby consensus in September, and as highlighted in \r\nyour letter, Mr. President, of 23 October, our work \r\nin the upcoming months should build upon the \r\nimportant progress achieved during the latest round \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations, especially on \r\nthe framework document prepared by Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray. Now that we finally have a text \r\non the table, it is time for us to move into concrete \r\nnegotiations. I wish to take this opportunity to thank \r\nAmbassador Rattray for his bold stewardship and his \r\nstrong commitment to a transparent and inclusive \r\nprocess.\r\nAs the United Nations turns 70, the Organization \r\nhas demonstrated a capacity to rise to challenges in a \r\nvariety of areas. The United Nations system has recently \r\nsucceeded in adopting an ambitious, forward-looking \r\nagenda, with significant potential for impact over the \r\ncoming years and decades. Such is the nature of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1), an extraordinary achievement that reflects a \r\ncommon vision for international cooperation on the \r\nintersection of economic, social and environmental \r\nconcerns.\r\nIn the human rights pillar, progress has been further \r\nconsolidated in the past years with the establishment \r\nof the universal periodic review process, which allows \r\nfor the human rights records of all Member States to \r\nbe reviewed and assessed. The three reports that are \r\ncurrently being considered by the United Nations \r\nmembership — produced by the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations (see A/70/95), the Advisory \r\nGroup of Experts on the Review of the Peacebuilding \r\nArchitecture (see A/69/968) and the authors of the \r\nglobal study on the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1325 (2000) — represent a solid foundation \r\nto underpin our discussions on the review of the \r\npolicies and practices of the Organization concerning \r\ninternational peace and security. Notwithstanding those \r\nimportant discussions, we will not be able to address \r\nthe Organization’s growing credibility gap on matters \r\n18/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nrelated to peace and security if we do not adapt the \r\nanachronistic structure and dynamics of the Security \r\nCouncil to the geopolitical realities of the twenty-first \r\ncentury.\r\nThere is an emerging consensus that the United \r\nNations needs to update its governance mechanisms \r\nand establish a renewed commitment to searching for \r\nsolutions through more effective cooperative efforts in \r\nthe field of promoting peace and security. At a time \r\nwhen we face the largest refugee crisis since the Second \r\nWorld War and the number of civilian victims of armed \r\nconflicts worldwide continues to increase, we cannot \r\nafford to allow the Security Council to have its authority \r\neroded, bringing discredit on the entire United Nations.\r\nIf our goal is to have a more functional Security \r\nCouncil, perpetuating the geopolitical status quo by \r\nan expansion restricted to the non-permanent category \r\nis not an option. Brazil firmly believes that the only \r\nway to ensure a more efficient and democratic Security \r\nCouncil is through an expansion that includes new \r\npermanent members. Let us recall that there are entire \r\nregions of the world that are absent from the permanent \r\nmember category, Africa being a case in point, as well \r\nas Latin America and the Caribbean.\r\nLast Saturday, we celebrated 70 years of the \r\nentering into force of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWhen the Charter was signed, in 1945, the Organization \r\nhad 51 Member States and the Security Council was \r\ncomposed of 11 members — five permanent and six \r\nnon-permanent. By the early 1960s, the United Nations \r\nmembership had doubled to around 115 members, so an \r\nexpansion of the Council was envisaged and arduously \r\nwon, leading to the inclusion of four additional \r\nnon-permanent seats.\r\nToday the United Nations is composed of 193 \r\nMember States, while the Security Council continues \r\nto function under the same format, with the permanent \r\nmembership category never having been altered. That \r\nis to say, the Council still ref lects a mid-twentieth \r\ncentury diplomatic environment even as we enter the \r\nsecond half of the second decade of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. If we are to establish a renewed international \r\ncompact to deal with peace and security through \r\ninternational law and multilateralism, we cannot forego \r\nour responsibility in dealing with this matter. The \r\nalternatives are too dramatic to contemplate.\r\nMr. Cardi (Italy), Vice-President, took the Chair\r\nThere is no longer any justification for evading this \r\nchallenge, especially when other daunting tasks before \r\nthe international community are being dealt with \r\nmultilaterally. This was, as I mentioned, the case with \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, but it will also be, I am confident, \r\nthe case with the climate change negotiations. Those \r\nare truly complex agendas. Our task is comparatively \r\nsimple. The President and Ambassador Lucas can help \r\nMember States make it happen during the seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Díaz de la Guardia Beuno (Spain) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): At the outset, I wish to express my \r\nappreciation to the President for the interest he is \r\nshowing on the issue of reforming the Security Council, \r\nin close collaboration with all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe warmly congratulate Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas on her appointment to her important position. \r\nShe can count on Spain’s full support. I should also \r\nlike to express our appreciation to her predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Rattray, for his work during his mandate.\r\nWe fully endorse the statement delivered earlier \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Italy on behalf of \r\nthe Uniting for Consensus group. I should like to make \r\nsome additional comments.\r\nAfter working for a long time on the process of \r\nreforming the Security Council, my delegation has \r\nlearned that our strength comes from unity, whereas \r\ndivisive approaches and actions only lead to delays \r\nand further complications. The States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations share the goal of a more representative, \r\naccountable, effective and democratic Security Council. \r\nIf we are to achieve that goal, then we must stand ready \r\nto consider new ideas and build bridges between the \r\nvarious groups and positions. I address Ambassador \r\nLucas to say that achieving that objective requires of \r\nus a totally transparent and inclusive process based \r\non broad-based consultations and ensuring a constant \r\nexchange of information, without unjustified haste or \r\nartificial deadlines. We have every confidence in her \r\nexperience and ability to successfully fulfil this task.\r\nWe are eager to see a modern version of the \r\nSecurity Council that is more representative and \r\ninfluential, where we see a reflection of the changes \r\nthat have taken place in recent years and the ability to \r\nadapt itself to future changes. We especially want to \r\nsee a Council where small States and African countries \r\nalso can make their voices heard. Spain believes that \r\n15-34211 19/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\nincreasing their presence will help make the Council \r\nmore representative. But we need much more than that. \r\nWe also believe that we must increase the possibilities \r\nfor all Member States to sit on the Council on a periodic \r\nbasis. The best way to achieve that objective is to \r\nincrease the number of elected seats, which is a step \r\nthat would also make the Council a more democratic \r\nand accountable body vis-à-vis all the Members of the \r\nOrganization. \r\nMembers all know that my country is against \r\ncreating new permanent seats, for we believe that \r\nwould not make the Council more representative or \r\neffective. On the contrary, we would be creating an \r\nexclusive Council rather than a more inclusive one and \r\nwould be turning our back on the need to make it more \r\ndemocratic and more credible.\r\nWe need a responsible and effective Council. Those \r\ntwo characteristics go hand in hand. Spain supports the \r\nidea of allowing those Member States that want to make \r\na meaningful contribution to the work of the Council \r\nto serve on it for longer periods and more frequently. \r\nSpain believes in a Security Council based on merit, \r\nnot priviliges.\r\nMy delegation shares the proposal of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group to create seats of longer duration, \r\nas well as the possibility of immediate re-election. That \r\nformula would make it possible for those States that so \r\nwish, and are in a position to do so, to contribute more \r\nto the work of the Council.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Spain’s willingness to \r\nwork alongside other groups and Member States to \r\nreach a timely, optimal and consensus-based solution.\r\nMr. Okamura (Japan): I would like to associate \r\nmyself fully with the statement delivered earlier by \r\nAmbassador Harald Braun of Germany on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Four (G-4) countries.\r\nAllow me to start by drawing attention to decision \r\n69/560, which Member States adopted by consensus last \r\nmonth. This was not just another technical, business-as-\r\nusual decision. It was the decision to formally recognize \r\nthe text and its annex circulated by the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, on 31 July of this year as \r\nthe basis for intergovernmental negotiations. The text \r\nis a product of everyone, under the able chairmanship \r\nof Ambassador Courtenay Rattray. I wish to thank him \r\nfor his strong stewardship, dedication and hard work.\r\nI recall that in March Member States were briefed \r\non the way forward to the text. It was made very clear \r\nthat each and every Member State was welcome to \r\npopulate the framework document with proposals and \r\npositions. Submissions to the framework document were \r\nkindly accepted even after the deadline. Each and every \r\nMember State that populated the framework document \r\nwas consulted intensively before the text was circulated. \r\nIn other words, the train for reform was always there for \r\nus. Everyone who wished to get on board was able to do \r\nso whenever they wished. We now have more than 120 \r\npassengers. Every passenger is treated equally and is \r\nwell seated. Seats still remain for more passengers who \r\nhave not yet gotten on the train. I cannot think of a more \r\nmembership-driven method for intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations than this. Japan therefore congratulates \r\nand warmly welcomes Her Excellency Ms. Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as \r\nthe new driver of this beautiful train.\r\nAlthough the text may not be as concise and \r\noperational as my delegation initially called for, I accept \r\nit because it is a product of everyone. I believe that is \r\nwhy Member States adopted by consensus decision \r\n69/560 to roll over the text to this session of the General \r\nAssembly as the basis for text-based negotiations. Japan \r\nsupports the new Chair in moving the process forward \r\ntowards actually launching text-based negotiations. \r\nI am sure many other Member States will join in that \r\nendeavour.\r\nThe text is an important starting point for text-based \r\nnegotiations, and yet it is only a starting point. I believe \r\nall Member States agree that we need to reform the \r\nSecurity Council in order to enhance its effectiveness \r\nand that we need to expand its membership to reflect \r\nthe realities of the international community in the \r\ntwenty-first century. The only thing we cannot agree \r\non at this moment is the configuration of the reformed \r\nCouncil and the treatment of the veto — two issues. \r\nReform requires negotiations. Negotiations require a \r\ntext. I believe Member States can negotiate to bridge \r\nthose only remaining substantial gaps based on the text.\r\nGeopolitical realities have changed over the past \r\n70 years. There are more Member States in today’s \r\nworld that have both the capacity and the willingness \r\nto take on the primary responsibility of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. If we increase \r\nonly non-permanent members, that will not bring an \r\nappropriate balance to reflect geopolitical realities in \r\nthe Council. The expansion of permanent membership \r\n20/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nwill surely strengthen the Council’s functioning, and \r\nthat is in line with the spirit of Article 23 of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nI understand there are some Member States that \r\nargue that we should greatly enhance the representation \r\nof developing countries but support only the expansion \r\nof non-permanent seats or the creation of a new \r\ncategory. I would like to ask those Member States for \r\ntheir views. What is their answer to the aspiration of \r\nour African friends, without having them as permanent \r\nmembers, considering what our African friends call \r\nthe “historical injustice done to Africa”? Do they think \r\nthat the legitimate aspiration expressed by our African \r\nfriends can be met by their argument?\r\nWe need to address the most controversial \r\nquestion — the veto. Initiatives put forward, most \r\nnotably by France and the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group, on restraining its use in \r\nsituations of mass atrocities are receiving growing \r\nsupport. Japan supports both those initiatives.\r\nIt is important to capitalize on the momentum \r\ngenerated by the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations. The G-4 leaders, who gathered here in New \r\nYork on 26 September, agreed on and pledged to reach \r\nout to Member States to achieve early and meaningful \r\nreform of the Security Council. The G-4 is determined \r\nto redouble its efforts towards securing concrete \r\noutcomes during this session of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation very much expects the President’s \r\nleadership on this important agenda item and will \r\nsupport him as we make progress during this very \r\ncritical year of the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations.\r\nMr. Lauber (Switzerland) (spoke in French): We \r\nwould like to thank the President for convening this \r\nmeeting on the question of equitable representation \r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil. As we celebrate the United Nations seventieth \r\nanniversary, this question remains highly relevant. We \r\nwelcome the decision by which the General Assembly \r\nreaffirmed its central role on this question and decided \r\nto continue the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nreform of the Security Council in informal plenary \r\nmeetings of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession.\r\nSince the beginning, the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process has demonstrated its complexity. \r\nWe thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, as the \r\noutgoing Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nfor his dedication and tireless efforts to move the \r\nprocess forward.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the appointment of \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg as the \r\nnew facilitator and Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We congratulate her on her appointment \r\nand are confident that she will carry on the \r\nconstructive work of her predecessor. We encourage \r\nAmbassador Lucas to build on the current momentum, \r\nand we wish her full success in the challenge ahead.\r\nLastly, I wish to assure the President that \r\nSwitzerland, as a member of the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group, will do everything \r\nit can to improve the working methods of the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nMs. Bird (Australia): Seventy years ago, at the 1945 \r\nSan Francisco Conference, and in 1946 as one of the \r\nfirst elected members of the Security Council, Australia \r\nargued strongly against the veto. We did so because \r\nwe saw it as hampering the Council’s effectiveness \r\nand legitimacy. Today those same reasons underscore \r\nour support for Security Council reform, reform that \r\nwill ensure that the Council is able to respond to \r\nmodern realities and uphold its Charter responsibilities \r\ntransparently, credibly and effectively.\r\nPut simply, the Council’s effectiveness and \r\nlegitimacy require, first, an expansion of its membership \r\nto reflect today’s geopolitical realities, secondly, limits \r\non the use of the veto, and thirdly, greater transparency \r\nin the Council’s workings.\r\nAustralia strongly supports the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group’s code of conduct \r\non Security Council action in situations of mass \r\natrocities, and the complementary French/Mexican \r\npolitical declaration on veto restraint. The strong, \r\nalmost overwhelming, support from the United Nations \r\nmembership for those proposals underscores how \r\nfundamental this reform is for the proper functioning \r\nof the United Nations in advancing international peace \r\nand security. The onus now is on the Security Council to \r\nrespond. We also urge all Council members to continue \r\nmaking the Council more accessible, transparent and \r\ninclusive. Openness and transparency can, and should, \r\nbe integrated into the day-to-day workings of the \r\nCouncil.\r\nExpansion of the Council’s membership is essential \r\nfor the Council’s continued legitimacy and relevance. \r\n15-34211 21/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\nThe Council continues to be badly out of step with the \r\nevolution of the world’s geopolitics. For those reasons, \r\nAustralia supports expansion in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories, including for a more \r\nequitable geographical balance.\r\nThe Council benefits from a diverse and changing \r\nelected membership. It will be crucial to ensure that any \r\nchanges to membership or duration of Council terms do \r\nnot prevent a diverse range of countries from seeking \r\nelection and serving as elected members.\r\nTogether we, the United Nations membership, \r\nmade substantial progress in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly. We warmly commend Ambassador Rattray \r\nfor leading a transparent, inclusive, results-oriented \r\nprocess in which more than 120 Member States \r\ncontributed to the framework text. That was an \r\nimportant achievement.\r\nSeventy years after the United Nations was \r\nestablished, the time has now come to move to text-\r\nbased negotiations on Council reform, on the basis of \r\nresolution 69/560 and the framework text. We have an \r\nunmistakable responsibility to reshape and adapt the \r\nSecurity Council so it is able to address the complex \r\npeace and security challenges over the next 70 years. \r\nWe therefore warmly welcome Ambassador Lucas’s \r\nappointment to lead the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess, and we pledge Australia’s full cooperation to \r\nachieve a strong result under her leadership.\r\nMs. Flores Herrera (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to begin by welcoming decision \r\n69/560, adopted at the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly under the presidency of Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nto continue with intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nreforming the Security Council,  a goal shared by more \r\nthan 90 per cent of Member States. We acknowledge \r\nand commend the leadership and commendable work \r\ncarried out as Chair by Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, to bring us to \r\ntoday’s point where we have a text on which we can \r\nnegotiate. The transparency, dedication and discipline \r\nwith which Ambassador Rattray led the discussions \r\nshould be emulated in any United Nations process.\r\nWe feel optimistic about the commitment taken on \r\nand expressed by President Lykketoft at the seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly, as well as his decision \r\nthat the negotiations going forward should be led \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas, representative of another \r\nsmall country that is committed to this reform process \r\nand that has shown good examples of making sure \r\nthat equity, justice and morality prevail in the various \r\norganizational and decision-making processes. In \r\naddition, we welcome the fact that a woman is presiding \r\nover the work involved in the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, fulfilling the objective of promoting gender \r\nequality and empowering women, and is also bringing \r\nher vast experience, sensitivity and knowledge to this \r\nposition.\r\nThe Security Council was born out of a cataclysmic \r\ntime for humankind — out of the ashes and suffering of \r\na world war. However, in our changing world in 70 years \r\nwe have seen only one substantive revision. Although \r\nthe Security Council has been successful in preventing \r\nanother global conflict, we are today seeing explosions \r\nof humanitarian crises that also transcend borders and \r\npresent huge challenges to the peace and security of the \r\nworld. The tragedies of refugees, of terrorism — just \r\nthose situations affect so many people. Those  women, \r\nmen and children are those whom we do not want to \r\nbe left behind in the Sustainable Development Agenda. \r\nHence we must promote the reform of the sole United \r\nNations organ whose decisions are binding and strictly \r\nimplemented.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council and other \r\nrelated matters are an essential component if we are \r\nto revitalize the United Nations as a body and make \r\nit fit for purpose in fulfilling the noble Agenda to \r\nwhich we recently subscribed (resolution 70/1). This \r\nissue is critical to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security and is also intrinsically bound up \r\nwith sustainable development. As Pope Francis said, \r\nin a world of of unfettered ambition and collective \r\nselfishness, it has never been more necessary to appeal \r\nto the moral conscience of the human being. We need \r\na paradigm shift that emphasizes ethical values and to \r\nmake sure that our actions are just and proper. \r\nThe Security Council needs to be revitalized to \r\nmake it not only more representative but also more \r\neffective, transparent and open to accountability to the \r\ninternational community. The recent launch of the code \r\nof conduct to restrict the use of the veto in the Security \r\nCouncil is an initial step towards that long-awaited \r\nreform and begin to rid ourselves of the anachronistic \r\ndistinctions between permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers.\r\n22/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nLet us resolve to crown this seventieth year of \r\nthe United Nations with a decision on the reform of \r\nthe Security Council. Let us not remain stuck in the \r\ndebate we began more than 20 years ago concerning the \r\nurgent need to reform it. We are an Organization that \r\nhas quadrupled in membership over those 70 years — a \r\nsign that the world has evolved and will continue to do \r\nso. That reality, which reflects a new historic moment in \r\nthe life of the United Nations, must also be reflected in \r\nan internal adaptation of its bodies so that its structure, \r\nfunctioning and dynamics respond to 193 Member \r\nStates, which should let go of any of rights or priviliges \r\nconferred upon them in other circumstances.\r\nPanama will continue to participate actively in \r\nthe intergovernmental process to reform the Security \r\nCouncil, devoted to our calling to offer compromises, \r\ntrying to bring seemly polarized positions closer \r\ntogether. We are convinced that the elements that unite \r\nus outnumber our differences. That is our commitment \r\nto “We the peoples of the United Nations”, to whom we \r\nare responsible.\r\nMr. Winid (Poland): I wish to thank the President \r\nfor convening this annual General Assembly debate \r\nand for his commitment to Security Council reform. \r\nI would like to assure him of Poland’s support in his \r\nefforts towards that goal.\r\nWe also welcome and congratulate the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg, Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, on her appointment as the new Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. I take this opportunity \r\nto thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica for \r\nhis dedication, leadership and excellent work during \r\nthe last round of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nOne of our birthday wishes to the United Nations as \r\nit turned 70 was to have a more representative, effective, \r\ntransparent and responsible Security Council. We would \r\nlike to see that organ adapted to the realities of today’s \r\nworld and fully complying with its responsibilities as \r\nenvisaged in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nPoland now looks forward to the immediate resumption \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations, as was agreed \r\nupon in September by us, the General Assembly. My \r\ndelegation is convinced that by building on the work \r\nundertaken during the Assembly’s last session we will \r\nbe able to take another significant step forward towards \r\nCouncil reform. In order to reach the much-needed \r\nconsensus, we must continue an open dialogue that \r\ncreates room for everyone to express their opinions and \r\narguments.\r\nThe United Nations is made up of regional groups \r\nof different sizes. All of them advocate their equitable \r\nrepresentation on the reformed Council. We firmly \r\nbelieve that the ambitions of the Group of African \r\nStates, as well as the Asian, Pacific and Latin American \r\ncountries, are equally justified. But being a member of \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States — the smallest \r\namong the regional groups but at the same time one \r\nthat has also witnessed a noticeable increase over the \r\nlast decades — we would like to repeat our call for an \r\nadditional non-permanent seat for the Eastern European \r\nGroup.\r\nWe also support efforts to make the Council’s \r\nactions more transparent and effective. Poland gladly \r\ncontributed to the Security Council’s open debate (see \r\nS/PV.7539) on its working methods held last week under \r\nthe very able Spanish presidency.\r\nFinally, with respect to the question of the veto \r\npower, we wish to welcome the growing number of \r\nsupporters of the French/Mexican proposal on restraint \r\nin its use. Poland has also endorsed the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group’s code of conduct \r\nthat aims at timely and decisive Security Council action \r\nagainst genocide, crimes against humanity and war \r\ncrimes.\r\nMr. Andanje (Kenya): My delegation attaches \r\ngreat importance to the subject before us. Let me \r\nbegin by commending Ambassador Courtenay Rattray \r\nof Jamaica, outgoing Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on reform of the Security Council. His \r\ndedication and commitment to moving forward the \r\nnegotiations at the sixty-ninth session of the General \r\nAssembly deserves our praise. I also congratulate \r\nHer Excellency Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg, on her appointment \r\nto chair the intergovernmental negotiations. It is an \r\nonerous task. I do not envy her. Nevertheless, I am \r\nconfident she will be able to build on her predecessor’s \r\nwork as the basis of our efforts to advance reform of \r\nthe Security Council. I assure her of my delegation’s \r\nsupport and cooperation.\r\nMy delegation fully aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Sierra Leone, \r\ncoordinator of the Group of African States. Kenya \r\nreaffirms its full support and commitment to the \r\n15-34211 23/24\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.43\r\ncommon African position and Africa’s legitimate claim \r\nembodied in the Ezulwini Consensus.\r\nMy delegation is pleased that the African Group \r\nstatement has comprehensively touched on the \r\nsubstantive issues on Security Council reform that are \r\nof the greatest concern to Africa and the wider United \r\nNations membership. In the interests of brevity and to \r\navoid repetition, my delegation would like to take this \r\nopportunity to highlight the following points.\r\nI believe I speak for many here when I say that our \r\ncountries occasionally come under undue pressure on \r\nissues of transparency and accountability at the national \r\nlevel. Unfortunately, in the context of governance of \r\ninternational institutions, that is not the case.\r\nAs the principle organ responsible for maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, the Security \r\nCouncil exemplifies a structure that is not compatible \r\nwith the current realities of the world. It does not reflect \r\nthe current world power distribution and geopolitical \r\nsituation. \r\nThe Council’s small size and exclusive nature, its \r\nrelations with the General Assembly and its working \r\nmethods and undemocratic nature are out of step with \r\ntoday’s demands. It is antiquated and ill-adapted to \r\nfulfil its tasks. Some regions of the world do not have \r\nrepresentation on the Council. Indeed, a considerable \r\nportion of the United Nations global constituency is \r\nunrepresented and unheard in the administration of \r\nglobal affairs. They do not have a say in the policies \r\nthat directly affect them. Africa, which provides a \r\nvery large share of the United Nations security agenda \r\nand is also the focus of considerable work of the \r\nOrganization, has no voice in the Council. That is not \r\nonly discriminatory, but also unfair and unjust.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that it is imperative that \r\nthe Council be able to meet contemporary standards and \r\nthe demands of the twenty-first century. It must meet \r\nexpectations of legitimacy based on accountability \r\nand democracy in its decision-making procedures and \r\nrepresentation. It is therefore incumbent upon us, the \r\nUnited Nations membership, collectively to ensure that \r\nthe Security Council reform process moves forward in \r\naccordance with the five guiding principles outlined in \r\ndecision 62/557.\r\nFinally, my delegation looks forward to engaging \r\nin open and transparent negotiations in which the entire \r\nmembership have an equal voice. We believe the work \r\ncarried out thus far provides a valuable basis for our \r\ncollective efforts to work towards reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. We must build on this as part of our efforts to \r\nmake the United Nations a more efficient and effective \r\ninstrument in the service of all the peoples of the world.\r\nMr. Sarki (Nigeria): Let me first thank the \r\nPresident and the secretariat for accommodating us to \r\nspeak at this time at the end of the morning’s meeting.\r\nFirst, Nigeria would like to commend the President \r\nfor the determination that he has shown to move the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process on Security \r\nCouncil reform forward during the seventieth session \r\nof the General Assembly. In particular, we commend \r\nhim for convening this important meeting, which is \r\nin fulfilment of his promise contained in the letter of \r\n23 October circulated to all missions.\r\nNigeria aligns itself with the statements made \r\nearlier by His Excellency Ambassador Vandi Minah, \r\nPermanent Representative of Sierra Leone, who \r\nspoke on behalf of the Group of African States on \r\nthe Common African Position, and also Ambassador \r\nMenissa Rambally, Permanent Representative of Saint \r\nLucia, who spoke on behalf of the L.69 group.\r\nWe have been following with keen interest the \r\nPresident’s views on the subject of Security Council \r\nreform ever since he was elected to office as the \r\nPresident of the seventieth session in June 2015. We \r\nrecall that in his acceptance speech after the election he \r\nobserved appropriately that:\r\n“Most interest seems to be centred on the reform \r\nof the Security Council and creating more \r\ntransparency and openness when selecting the next \r\nSecretary-General” (A/69/PV.94, p. 3)\r\nThereafter, he assured the Assembly that he would \r\ncontinue this work when the seventieth session began and \r\nthat he would “conduct the presidency as transparently, \r\ninclusively and openly as possible.” (ibid.)\r\nIt is noteworthy that the issue of the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council continues to receive attention at the \r\nhighest levels. It is important for us to recall that at \r\nthe just-concluded India-Africa Summit in New Delhi, \r\nleaders underlined the need for an early reform of the \r\nCouncil to adjust to the changing realities of the world.\r\nNigeria commends Member States for adopting \r\ndecision 69/560, of 14 September 2015, by which the \r\nGeneral Assembly reaffirmed its central role on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\n24/24 15-34211\r\nA/70/PV.43 30/10/2015\r\nmatters related to its work. By this, Member States \r\nalso decided to continue with the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform in informal \r\nplenary of the General Assembly during the seventieth \r\nsession.\r\nConsistent with this decision, it will be \r\nrecalled that the President, in his opening address \r\nat the commencement of the seventieth session on \r\n15 September, reassured Member States by stating that, \r\nresponding to\r\n“the continued interest among many Member \r\nStates in both the reform of the Security Council \r\nand in creating more transparency and openness \r\nwhen selecting the next Secretary-General, I will \r\ncontinue the work mandated by Member States on \r\nboth of those issues.” (A/70/PV.1, p. 2).\r\nSimilarly, in his opening speech of the general \r\ndebate on 28 September, he underscored his resolve to \r\nsupport\r\n“new ideas on how to strengthen global peace \r\nand security, from the role of women to conflict \r\nprevention, mediation and settlement; from \r\nUnited Nations peace operations to the overall \r\npeacebuilding architecture and Security Council \r\nreform.” (A/70/PV.13, p. 5)\r\nThese are very important commitments that the \r\nPresident has given to Member States. His commitment \r\nto this process resonated in the content of his letter of \r\n23 October, wherein he informed Member States of \r\nhis appointment of Her Excellency Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations during \r\nthe seventieth session. In the letter he rightly observed \r\nthat the discussion on this subject gained greater \r\nmomentum during the sixty-ninth session under the \r\nleadership of the Honourable Sam Kutesa, whom we \r\nwish to commend for his steadfast commitment to the \r\nreform of the Security Council.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, we must strive to build on \r\nthe laudable achievement recorded during the previous \r\nsession, when for the first time we had a text upon which \r\nnegotiations would now be based. Consequently, we are \r\nvery hopeful that today’s meeting and subsequent steps \r\nwill firmly build on this momentum. The cadence must \r\nnot drop. The tempo must be sustained.\r\nWe commend Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, who chaired the \r\nprocess at its eleventh round, during the sixty-ninth \r\nsession, for his exemplary leadership. In the same vein \r\nwe welcome the appointment of Ambassador Lucas \r\nand congratulate her on it. We are grateful to her for \r\naccepting this enormous responsibility and assure her of \r\nour cooperation. We encourage her to inject new vigour \r\ninto the process and determinedly move it forward in a \r\nsignificant way during the seventieth session.\r\nNigeria has always expressed its support for the \r\nadvancement of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess in an open, inclusive and transparent manner. As \r\nwe prepare to move into the next round of negotiations \r\nduring this session, we thank all delegations that have \r\ncontinued to express their support for the Common \r\nAfrican Position. We would like to seize this opportunity \r\nto reaffirm this Common African Union Position on \r\nthe entire subject of Security Council reform, to which \r\nwe adhere very strongly. That is important in order to \r\ncorrect the historical injustice done to the continent and \r\nits continued marginalization over so many years.\r\nFor that reason, we wish to underscore the \r\noverriding need to ensure that the interests of Africa \r\ncontinue to be put forward and safeguarded. African \r\nStates have offered a coherent, practical and persuasive \r\nblueprint for the Council’s reform. We have come up \r\nwith a common position, which asserts the right of our \r\ncontinent that has for so long been marginalized, and \r\nwe recognize the legitimate aspirations of other regions \r\nto be fully represented in the Council.\r\nSecurity Council reform is inspired by the \r\nprinciples of the Charter itself. The clear objective \r\nof this process is based on the sovereign equality of \r\nall Member States and on the need to adhere to the \r\nprinciples of democratization and inclusiveness in the \r\nUnited Nations. It is undoubtedly a worthwhile process. \r\nTherefore, we must muster the desired political will \r\nthat can lead to the achievement of a reformed Security \r\nCouncil sooner rather than indefinitely.\r\nFinally, what is required of us at this juncture is to \r\nmove to the stage of actual negotiations with the aid \r\nof a text, which is now available to us. There should \r\nbe marked progress in the forthcoming negotiations far \r\nbeyond what we achieved during the sixty-ninth session. \r\nWe look forward with great optimism to the next line \r\nof actions during the seventieth session. We assure the \r\nPresident of our full cooperationin that respect.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
