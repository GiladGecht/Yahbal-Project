We congratulate \r\nthe Ambassador of Luxembourg, Ms. Sylvie Lucas, \r\non her appointment to lead the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations group and assure her of the support of my \r\ndelegation.\r\nThe General Assembly has debated the issue \r\nbefore us for more than 20 years. The discussion has \r\nbeen important and indispensable in bringing out the \r\npositions of countries on the issue and in encouraging \r\nbetter understanding of the urgency of Security \r\nCouncil reform. It is difficult to sustain the status quo \r\nnearly seven decades after the founding of the United \r\nNations, without bearing in mind the profound political, \r\nsocial and economic evolution that human history has \r\nexperienced during that time.\r\nCuba reiterates the need to convert the Security \r\nCouncil into a democratic, transparent and representative \r\ninstitution, where the 193 Member States really feel \r\nrepresented and can recognize the full legitimacy of \r\nthe provision of Article 24 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations that confers on the Council the responsibility to \r\nact on their behalf. That requires the Security Council \r\nto comply fully with the mandate conferred by the \r\nGeneral Assembly through various decisions, including \r\nthe most recent, decision 69/560, of 17 September, on \r\nthe question of equitable representation in the Security \r\nCouncil and an increase in the number of its members \r\nand related matters.\r\nWe are grateful for the efforts in that regard by \r\nthe former President of the General Assembly and the \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, the outgoing \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations group. \r\nWe congratulate both for the results achieved. The \r\nrounds of discussions held to date and the compilations \r\nof positions that they have produced confirm, in our \r\nopinion, that the immense majority of Member States \r\nsupport, at the minimum, expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in its two categories of members, permanent \r\nand non-permanent, the elimination of the right of the \r\nveto, fundamental reform of the Council’s working \r\nmethods, approval of the Council’s rules of procedure \r\nso that they cease to be provisional, and respect for the \r\nrespective mandates of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, as set out in the Charter of the United \r\nNations.\r\nCuba is prepared to embark without further \r\ndelay on the negotiations that the process requires. \r\nWe agree with the majority of delegations that all of \r\nthe proposals formulated during the deliberations of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations group must be \r\ntaken into account. The process must be inclusive and \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.44\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n44th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 30 October 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\ntransparent. While the positions of Cuba on the issue \r\nare well known, I should like to reiterate them for the \r\nbenefit of the new cycle of discussions.\r\nWe are in favour of a substantial increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council, to approximately \r\n25 or 26 States. That expansion must take place in both \r\ncategories of members and basically, the increase should \r\nbe in members from the developing countries. The \r\nfundamental goal must be to overcome the unjustifiable \r\nlack of representation of the developing countries in the \r\nSecurity Council. The new members of an expanded \r\nCouncil, both permanent and non-permanent, should \r\nhave the same duties and prerogatives that current \r\nmembers enjoy, including the veto, if that cannot be \r\neliminated. Cuba would not be opposed to the possibility \r\nof the immediate re-election of the non-permanent \r\nmembers. Cuba is not in favour of the creation of new \r\ncategories of members, because that could further \r\ndeepen existing differences and encourage division in \r\nthe body.\r\nWith regard to the veto, Cuba’s views are well \r\nknown. That antidemocratic and anachronistic privilege \r\nshould, in our firm belief, be eliminated. The reform of \r\nthe Council must include, as a priority, reform of its \r\nworking methods. We advocate a transparent Security \r\nCouncil, where closed-door consultations would \r\nbe the exception rather than the rule. We aspire to a \r\nCouncil that deals with themes within its purview and \r\ndoes not encroach on the other principal bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations. We want a Council that really takes \r\ninto account the opinions of the States Members of \r\nthe Organization before adopting decisions and that \r\nguarantees a real level of access to States that are not \r\nmembers of the organ.\r\nI reiterate that Cuba does not insist on achieving \r\nan immediate agreement. We understand perfectly the \r\ncomplexities and sensitivities of the process, which will \r\ntake time, effort and especially, a spirit of f lexibility \r\nin the negotiations. However, to pretend that we accept \r\nas valid the structure and procedures of the Security \r\nCouncil, which were designed in 1945 for a world \r\norder that no longer exists, when facing challenges and \r\nthreats unimaginable at the time that the Organization \r\nwas established would be to obstinately fail to realize \r\nthe dramatic evolution of international relations and of \r\nthe United Nations over the past 70 years. Reform of \r\nthe Security Council in the twenty-first century will \r\nbe a triumph of multilateralism, peace and maturity, \r\nbuilding on the experience of seven decades, and not \r\nof the distribution of power resulting from a global \r\nmilitary confrontation. Cuba stands ready to meet that \r\nchallenge successfully.\r\nMr. Orellana Zabalza (Guatemala) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, I would like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas and welcome her as the new \r\nChair for the intergovernmental negotiations. We are \r\nconvinced that under her leadership we will be able to \r\nmake progress in reaching consensus on this important \r\nissue.\r\nMy delegation reiterates its commitment to \r\ncontinuing to work on the Security Council reform \r\nprocess, which should be exhaustive, transparent and \r\nequitable. From our viewpoint, institutions cannot \r\nremain static, nor can they stagnate in an historic \r\ntime frame. They must be equipped for change so as \r\nto respond effectively to the circumstances in which \r\nthey work. That vision is not different from what we \r\nexpect in the framework of Security Council reform. It \r\nis unquestionable that the political and economic world \r\nreality of 1945 is not comparable to what we are seeing \r\ntoday. That is why we must review the structure and \r\nfunction of that body. We believe that the Council must \r\nbe dynamic, representative and transparent. We must \r\nensure that it can respond appropriately to any threat \r\nto international peace and security in the twenty-first \r\ncentury, while at the same time ensuring its efficiency \r\nand effectiveness.\r\nGiven the prevailing paralysis and inertia, the \r\nCouncil is being exposed to a progressive loss of \r\nrelevance, which causes even greater tension in the \r\nprevailing order. That paralysis has, for instance, been \r\nincreasing with the use or the threat of the use of the veto \r\nby the permanent members of Security Council. Rather \r\nthan encouraging collective defence with arguments \r\nthat could ensure consensus, the veto has obstructed and \r\ndiverted common interests and caused division among \r\nits members. Furthermore, with the passage of time, we \r\nhave proven that the concerns with regard to the veto \r\nexpressed by the majority of delegations during the San \r\nFrancisco Conference in 1945 remain fully valid, which \r\nfurther justifies a review of the issue.\r\nGuatemala wonders whether or not the veto should \r\nbe allowed, and in particular whether it would be \r\ndesirable for other States to have the same right within \r\nthe framework of Council reform. A first step, which \r\nwe welcome, consists of the initiatives of France and \r\nMexico to restrict the use of the veto and the proposed \r\n15-34312 3/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\ncode of conduct regarding Security Council action \r\nagainst genocide, crimes against humanity and war \r\ncrimes. We have supported those initiatives and await \r\ntheir implementation.\r\nWe know that any change is difficult, and in that \r\nregard we believe that the process of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations must serve to gradually advance the \r\nsubstantive reform of the Security Council. Differences \r\nof opinion can be overcome only through the \r\ncommitment and will of all Member States rather than \r\nthrough imposition. After more than two decades of \r\ndiscussion, the repetition of various positions has come \r\nat a high cost in terms of time, effort and resources. \r\nOur collective focus must be fixed on achieving a real \r\nagreement, through an inclusive process in which we \r\nare all prepared to be f lexible and constructive.\r\nAt the same time, it is also important to recognize \r\nthe role that the members of the Security Council \r\nplay in advancing that process. Regular discussions \r\non the Council’s working methods would allow us \r\nto take important steps to improve its effectiveness \r\nand transparency. Annual open debates on the issue \r\nin the Security Council also contribute to achieving \r\nthat commitment. In that respect, we are encouraged \r\nthat this morning the Council adopted presidential \r\nstatement S/PRST/2015/19, on the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council, which was the result of the open \r\ndebate held last week (see S/PV.7539). We consider it a \r\nvaluable contribution.\r\nLastly, my delegation believes that the process \r\nof reforming the Security Council can and must be \r\nstrengthened alongside the process of revitalizing the \r\nGeneral Assembly. There is an undeniable connection \r\nbetween the work of the two bodies that must be \r\nimproved. The adoption of resolution 69/321 is a clear \r\nexample of the possibility of achieving change and \r\nreaching consensus. We hope to continue to examine \r\nall pending issues in that regard, and my delegation is \r\nprepared to work to that end.\r\nMr. Hetesy (Hungary): Hungary warmly welcomes \r\nthe decision of the President of the General Assembly to \r\norganize this meeting and to appoint Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, \r\nas Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. At the same time, we wish to \r\nexpress our sincere gratitude to Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, and \r\nhis team for their commitment and for the progress \r\nachieved. We also express our appreciation for the \r\nfact that the negotiation process was made Member \r\nState-driven, which allowed for real engagement on the \r\npart of all delegations that so wished, in an inclusive \r\nand transparent manner.\r\nThe best way to honour the work done by the \r\noutgoing Chair is to maintain the momentum generated \r\nduring the sixty-ninth session of the General Assembly. \r\nThere is no need to go back to square one, and the new \r\nChair should be able to build on the progress achieved. \r\nAs the President of the General Assembly himself \r\npointed out this morning (see A/70/PV.43), there are \r\ndifferent and legitimate national views when it comes \r\nto Security Council reform. The only way to take \r\nthose interests into account, while working to agree \r\non the much-needed reform, is through meaningful \r\nnegotiations. \r\nHungary, not being a member of any of the \r\nnegotiation groups, is ready to move forward with \r\nsubstantive negotiations without preconditions. We \r\ncall on others to follow suit. In our assessment, for \r\nsubstantive negotiations we will need a text on the \r\nbasis of which we can start negotiations. Furthermore, \r\nwe will need to have a work programme and meetings \r\nat regular intervals, aimed at producing new drafts, \r\nnarrowing down differences and reducing the number \r\nof outstanding issues, because this type of negotiations \r\ndoes not differ from others.\r\nWhile we work on comprehensive reform, the \r\nCouncil and United Nations Member States should \r\ncontinue to work on the gradual improvement of the \r\nCouncil’s working methods and activities. The two \r\nprocesses do not exclude each other. On the contrary, \r\nthey may create virtuous cycles. Recent examples \r\nof such an approach include resolution 69/321 on the \r\nrevitalization of the General Assembly, with new \r\nelements concerning the selection of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Since that resolution was also mentioned as \r\na positive example today, may I point out that it was \r\nalso achieved through text-based negotiations. Two \r\nother examples include the Franco-Mexican proposals \r\non the use of the veto and the proposed code of conduct \r\non Security Council action, promulgated by the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency group, \r\nwhich is already supported by 106 countries, including \r\nnine members of the Security Council. That is already \r\na tangible result. As we know, the Council needs nine \r\naffirmative votes to adopt a resolution. We call on the \r\nother members of the Security Council to follow suit.\r\n4/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nThe three well-coordinated review processes on \r\npeacekeeping, peacebuilding, and women and peace \r\nand security will also give the Council an opportunity \r\nto move out of its self-imposed silos. The Council \r\nshould also make effective and efficient use of the \r\nwindfall of new peacekeeping capacities generated by \r\nthe Peacekeeping Summit.\r\nFinally, world leaders have also agreed recently \r\nthat peace and security are clear prerequisites for \r\nsustainable development, which, in turn, is the basis \r\nfor lasting international peace and security. That \r\nunderstanding will have to be translated into new types \r\nof improved interaction between the Council and other \r\nUnited Nations bodies. We warmly welcome, therefore, \r\nthe open debate on the subject in the Security Council \r\nto be organized by the United Kingdom presidency in \r\nNovember.\r\nMr. Nduhuura (Uganda): My delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statement delivered by the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Sierra Leone and Coordinator of \r\nthe Committee of Ten on behalf of the African Union \r\nmember States (see A/70/PV.43).\r\nAt the outset, I avail myself of the opportunity to \r\ncommend the President for convening this timely debate \r\nto discuss the question of equitable representation on \r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand related matters. With profound appreciation, I also \r\nthank the President’s predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession, for identifying Security Council reform as one \r\nof his key priorities during his tenure. The momentum \r\ngalvanized by the recent adoption of the substantive \r\nAssembly decision 69/560 on the subject, termed the \r\nKutesa consensus, on 14 September, set an abiding \r\nstage for negotiations.\r\nI wish to congratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, on her \r\nappointment as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and to express our deepest gratitude \r\nto Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica and Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the sixty-\r\nninth session, for his valuable contribution and \r\nskilled leadership in stewarding the work of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations in an open, transparent \r\nand consultative manner.\r\nToday’s world faces challenges that would have \r\nbeen difficult to comprehend just after the Second \r\nWorld War. The global body that was established in \r\n1945 to save succeeding generations from the scourge of \r\nwar has, however, not lived up to people’s expectations \r\nseventy years later and runs the risk, therefore, of losing \r\nrelevance if it does not adapt to the realities of today. \r\nThe commemoration of the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe founding of the United Nations should serve to \r\nenhance the momentum for a Security Council reform \r\nthat reflects the changes of the times and achieves \r\nsuccess in that task.\r\nUganda firmly believes that the United Nations, \r\nand the Security Council in particular, must become \r\nmore democratic, inclusive and representative of our \r\nworld. It should address a historical injustice by giving \r\na voice to Africa.\r\nTasked with the responsibility of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, the Security Council \r\nhas been an integral organ of the United Nations \r\nsince its establishment in 1945. However, changing \r\ngeopolitical realities, coupled with an increase in \r\nthe United Nations membership, has brought into \r\nquestion the Council’s effectiveness and legitimacy, \r\nemphasized by its inability to address recent conflicts \r\nand humanitarian crises around the globe.\r\nIndeed, changing geopolitical realities are cogent \r\nenough to galvanize momentum and obtain political \r\nleverage so as to spur intergovernmental negotiations \r\nand move forward. There is a need to ensure credible \r\nnegotiations and not be satisfied with the mere repetition \r\nof national and group statements that have characterized \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiation process and resulted \r\nin no progress being made.\r\nAs we all are aware, the journey towards reform \r\nof the Security Council has thus far been a long and \r\ntedious one. Several decades after the world summit \r\nthat prioritized the need for Security Council reform, \r\nwe are still reminded that this topic is by no means a \r\nnew initiative. The challenges we face have become \r\nmore complex, given the wide range of new and \r\nemerging threats to international peace and security. \r\nWe therefore need to reform the Security Council to \r\nmake it more representative, effective and efficient.\r\nIn his keynote address in May this year, during \r\nthe high-level thematic debate on strengthening \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand subregional organizations, the President of Uganda \r\nstated:\r\n15-34312 5/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\n“It is very presumptuous for the five permanent \r\nmembers to claim that they are responsible for global \r\nsecurity. Out of the global human population, which \r\nis now 7 billion people, the five permanent members \r\nrepresent only about 1.9 billion people. How and \r\nwhy should they monopolize the responsibility for \r\nglobal security? This is a structural deficiency in \r\nthe architecture for global security.”\r\nThe increase in the membership of and equitable \r\nand geographical representation on the Security \r\nCouncil have become imperative because of the need to \r\ndemocratize the Council and make it more efficient and \r\ntransparent. The democracy of which Member States are \r\nconstantly reminded should prevail in the international \r\nsystem. It is imperative to review the composition and \r\nthe decision-making process of the Council in line with \r\nthe aforementioned principles.\r\nThe non-implementation of these ideals puts to the \r\ntest those who preach them. It is important to bear in \r\nmind the need for equitable geographical representation, \r\nwith the emphasis on an increase in the permanent \r\nmembership for the benefit of the African continent, \r\nwhich has remained unrepresented in the permanent \r\ncategory and underrepresented in the non-permanent \r\ncategory, as reflected in the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration. The African Common Position \r\ngarners the broad support of the wider membership of \r\nthis body, and Uganda commends those Member States \r\nthat have frequently expressed their support for the \r\nAfrican Common Position.\r\nThe work done during the previous session, and in \r\nparticular the text that was circulated by the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session \r\nin his letter dated 31 July, remain the only basis for \r\nnegotiations. We are grateful that in his letter appointing \r\nthe new Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nPresident Lykketoft emphasized the text and its annex \r\nas per decision 69/560. This resonates with the theme \r\nof the seventieth session, “The United Nations at 70: a \r\nnew commitment to action”.\r\nI wish to stress that commitment to reform should be \r\nreflected in a willingness to demonstrate a commitment \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations process by \r\nmaking progress in that context. The task ahead is to \r\ncommence negotiations in a spirit of compromise and \r\nf lexibility, based on the same text as per established \r\npractice in this body.\r\nIt is my hope that today’s debate will serve as a \r\nuseful foundation for reform discussions and galvanize \r\nproductive negotiations over the coming months. Rest \r\nassured of Uganda’s commitment to supporting the new \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations in moving \r\nthis process forward.\r\nLet us preserve and promote the noble ideals for \r\nwhich the United Nations was established.\r\nMr. Aboulatta (Egypt): I would like at the outset \r\nto thank the President of the General Assembly for \r\nhaving convened this annual plenary meeting on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council. I wish in this \r\nconnection to express my appreciation to the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, for his hard work and dedication as Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the sixty-ninth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We are confident that \r\nhis inspiring enthusiasm and principled dedication to \r\nthe cause of reform will remain as vital an asset in his \r\ncurrent capacity as a vocal representative of a Member \r\nState as it was during his presence at the helm of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nIn the same vein, I extend my sincere congratulations \r\nto Ambassador Sylvie Lucas on her appointment as \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations. I am \r\nconfident that with her wisdom and devotion, she will \r\nbe able to bring us closer to our desired destination \r\nof a reformed Security Council and a stronger United \r\nNations. She may rest assured of my delegation’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation.\r\nEgypt associates itself with the statements delivered \r\non behalf of the Group of African States and the Group \r\nof Arab States (see A/70/PV.43).\r\nEgypt holds the firm belief that a more representative, \r\ncredible and democratic Security Council is an integral \r\nelement of the reform of the United Nations to enable \r\nit to effectively undertake its responsibilities as \r\nenshrined in the Charter. These goals can be achieved \r\nonly through an intergovernmental process that is \r\ntransparent, fully inclusive and State-owned and \r\ndriven, seeking a comprehensive solution that can \r\ngarner the widest agreement by Member States and \r\nthat addresses the five key issues stipulated in decision \r\n62/557. That decision, which was adopted by consensus \r\nby the entire membership, established the foundation of \r\nthe current intergovernmental negotiations process, and \r\n6/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nstaying faithful to its provisions is the key to moving \r\nthe process forward.\r\nThe new chairmanship of this process provides \r\na much-needed opportunity to focus the process of \r\nnegotiations on its set goal, which is to reform the \r\nSecurity Council by making it more representative, \r\ncredible and effective while preserving the founding \r\nvalues of the Organization, which is based on the \r\nconcept of united nations. The Organization can be \r\nmore representative, effective and credibly only when it \r\nremains united. The widest political agreement is hence \r\nthe key to a comprehensive reform of the Council as \r\nprojected by decision 62/557.\r\nFor that reason, the process of negotiations can best \r\nadvance with reassurance on and further elaboration \r\nof the principles and criteria underpinning the \r\nnegotiations. This is not new; it has been stated over \r\nand over. The time is now ripe for full implementation \r\nso as to preserve the unity of the general membership by \r\nreaching an agreed vision for the future of the process \r\nand how to move it forward.\r\nA piecemeal approach that is driven by the desire \r\nof a few for expansion rather than by a commitment to \r\ngeneral reform will not lead to a more representative, \r\ncredible or effective Council. The Council has suffered \r\nfor too long from paralysis and selectivity on many \r\noccasions. Only comprehensive reform, not a cosmetic \r\nadjustment in its membership or working methods, \r\ncan address the current structural imbalances. In that \r\ncontext, we are reminded of the historical injustice \r\nsuffered by Africa, which remains the only continent \r\nabsent from the permanent membership of the Council, \r\ndespite the fact that the Council agenda remains \r\nsubstantially focused on issues related to peace and \r\nsecurity on the continent. That further attests to the \r\nunique relevance and distinctive, comprehensive nature \r\nof the Common African Position.\r\nMr. Cheong (Malaysia): At the outset, I wish to \r\nthank the President for convening this timely and \r\nimportant debate. \r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I take this opportunity \r\nto thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, for his tireless efforts in \r\nsteering the work of the previous intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. I also wish \r\nto congratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxemburg, on her appointment as \r\nthe new Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nand to affirm Malaysia’s commitment to working \r\nclosely and constructively with her.\r\nAs a current non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council, Malaysia remains steadfast in its \r\ndetermination to see a more representative, democratic, \r\nlegitimate, transparent and, ultimately, a more efficient \r\nand effective Security Council. However, for the past \r\nseven years, despite the best efforts, there has been \r\nno official document that could provide a sound basis \r\nfor negotiations on Security Council reform. Against \r\nthat background, my delegation welcomes and fully \r\nsupports the decisions contained in decision 69/560 \r\nof 14 September, which was adopted under the Kutesa \r\nconsensus. We share the assessment that that decision \r\nrepresents a historic milestone and game-changer. \r\nMalaysia looks forward to making further progress \r\non all the issues being dealt with in the negotiations \r\nprocess during the current General Assembly session. \r\nWe believe that text-based negotiations are the right \r\nway forward.\r\nMalaysia has been consistent in reiterating its \r\nposition on the core issues of Council reform. We \r\ncontinue to believe that there is a need to expand the \r\nCouncil’s membership so as to include developing \r\ncountries in both the permanent and the non-permanent \r\ncategories and to ensure equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation. Such expansion would strengthen the \r\nCouncil’s role and provide for more inclusiveness in its \r\ndecision-making process.\r\nOn the question of the veto power held by the five \r\npermanent members, Malaysia supports the call for the \r\nabolishment of the use of the veto in conformity with \r\nthe principle of sovereign equality as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We also fully support \r\nthe call for restraint in the use of the veto power, \r\nespecially in cases of international crimes of the most \r\nserious nature, such as genocide, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. For those reasons, we are pleased to \r\nhave joined the two recent initiatives introduced by a \r\ngroup of like-minded countries to regulate the use of \r\nthe veto.\r\nMalaysia strongly supports the view that, overall, \r\nthe work of the Security Council should be enhanced \r\nand improved. Working within the context of the \r\nSecurity Council, we have consistently supported \r\nefforts to enhance and improve the annual reports of \r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly. We \r\nalso see value in the practice of regular consultations \r\n15-34312 7/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nbetween the President of the General Assembly and \r\nthe President of the Security Council. In addition, we \r\nstrongly believe that there should be more structured \r\ninteraction and regular consultations between the \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission.\r\nWith regard to the Council’s working methods, \r\nMalaysia, along with other Council members, both \r\npermanent and non-permanent, will continue to work \r\nto enhance the transparency and inclusiveness of the \r\nvarious aspects of the Council’s work. In that regard, \r\nwe are pleased to note that the Council was able to \r\nagree on presidential statement S/PRST/2015/19, which \r\nwas adopted earlier today.\r\nA working draft document on Council reform, \r\nencompassing all the various proposals submitted by \r\nMember States, would enable us to clearly identify areas \r\nwhere differences can be bridged. More importantly, \r\nnegotiations should continue to be conducted in an \r\ninclusive and transparent manner. It is worth recalling \r\nthat in 2005, our leaders committed to a reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. Indeed, the reform of the Council \r\nis long overdue. The need for an effective Security \r\nCouncil capable of responding to the emerging threats \r\nto international peace and security cannot be overstated. \r\nTherefore, a reformed Security Council that is more \r\ndemocratic, efficient and transparent is paramount in \r\norder to better reflect the geopolitical realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nFor all of us to make meaningful progress in the \r\nreform of the Security Council, all Member States \r\nmust demonstrate the necessary political will and the \r\nwillingness to compromise and show considerable \r\nf lexibility. That will require that all stakeholders \r\napproach the upcoming negotiations with an open mind \r\nand move away from entrenched national and group \r\npositions.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to assure the President of the \r\nAssembly and all Member States of my delegation’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation in moving the process forward.\r\nMs. Mutandi (Zambia): Zambia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Sierra Leone on behalf of the Group of African States \r\n(see A/70/PV.43).\r\nI wish to echo the sentiments expressed by \r\ndelegations that have spoken before me to congratulate \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession. He may rest assured of my delegation’s \r\ntotal support. With his expertise and guidance, we \r\nare confident that the General Assembly will make \r\ntremendous strides on the various issues of interest to \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations. I also wish to \r\napplaud the efforts of his predecessor, Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nwho placed the issue of Security Council reform among \r\nhis priorities during his tenure as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session.\r\nI also wish to congratulate Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxemburg, on \r\nher appointment as facilitator for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. As stated \r\nby the representative of Sierra Leone, Zambia, which \r\nworked as part of the Committee  of Ten of the African \r\nGroup and provided full support, has every confidence \r\nin Ambassador Lucas’ abilities to move the negotiations \r\nprocess forward. I also want to pay special tribute \r\nto her predecessor, Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, \r\nPermanent Representative of Jamaica, for the traction \r\nthat he gave to the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nduring the sixty-ninth session.\r\nZambia believes in the key tenets and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, which promote \r\nthe equality of nations and individuals. It is for that \r\nreason that Zambia, through the united efforts of the \r\nAfrican Group, has been promoting the just cause for \r\ninclusiveness, equitable representation, transparency \r\nand full accountability of the Security Council \r\nthrough the process of reforms. It is an undeniable fact \r\nthat, in the past 70 years, the geopolitical landscape \r\nhas been transformed in a manner that requires us \r\nto make profound adjustments to our approach to \r\ndecision-making on issues of international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nIt is our humble expectation that this session will \r\nbuild on the progress achieved so far and advance \r\ntowards realizing the aspirations of Africa, which \r\nremains the only continent underrepresented in \r\nthe non-permanent category and not represented \r\nin the permanent category. Zambia, as part of the \r\nAfrican Group, reiterates its position for the full and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nIn conclusion, we reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nreform process and therefore ask the United Nations \r\nmembership to address Africa’s historical injustice as \r\na continent that has been denied its rightful place in the \r\nhouse of nations. Seventy years after the establishment \r\n8/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nof the United Nations, let us not have another 70 years \r\npremised on the practice of such an imbalance.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to begin by thanking the former President \r\nof the General Assembly, Mr. Sam Kutesa, and \r\nAmbassador Courtenay Rattray for their efforts \r\nduring the sixty-ninth session. I also wish to welcome \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas in her new capacity as \r\nfacilitator of this essential negotiating process for our \r\nOrganization. With her insider’s knowledge gained as a \r\nmember of the Security Council for the past two years, \r\nI am sure that we can count on Ambassador Lucas as \r\nsomeone who understands the difficulties of a Council \r\nthat is constrained by its structure, working methods \r\nand composition, which can, on occasion, endanger its \r\neffective and democratic functioning.\r\nAs Ambassador Sebastiano Cardi, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Italy, said in his role as coordinator \r\nof the Uniting for Consensus group (see A/70/PV.43), \r\nwhich my delegation endorses, Security Council reform \r\nmust respond to a process guided by the Member States \r\nof the Organization, pursuant to decision 62/557. Any \r\nother method of proceeding would hinder the necessary \r\nreform. \r\nTo be able to advance, it is necessary that during \r\nthe course of intergovernmental negotiations, we \r\nchange the dynamic so that it is not stagnant and so that \r\nin each subsequent cycle, we do not have to begin from \r\nzero with a clear waste of resources and time, achieving \r\na result that, at the end of the day, is not in everyone’s \r\ninterest.\r\nColombia’s traditional position of rejecting, inter \r\nalia, the expansion of the privileges established on \r\nmatters such as the veto, remains as valid as ever, as \r\nwe see the difficulties it causes in the Council when \r\nthe Council must confront current crises. Guided by the \r\nprinciples of democracy, transparency and inclusion, \r\nwe must find a way to overcome the very difficult \r\nproblems confronting humankind.\r\nOther efforts have been made to strengthen the \r\nwork of the United Nations and to ensure that the system \r\nworks in a more coordinated and coherent way when it \r\nseeks to achieve a sustainable peace, which is one of its \r\nprimary objectives. That is why much of the reviews of \r\npeacekeeping operations, and the new architecture for \r\npeacebuilding are aimed at dealing comprehensively \r\nwith conflict, from its genesis to its evolution to its \r\nlater stages. That vision will require a United Nations \r\nsystem that can count on the capacities and necessary \r\ntools to be able to meet those challenges.\r\nMy delegation welcomes this process and values the \r\nefforts of the President in conducting this exercise on a \r\nsubject that summons, without doubt, the interests and \r\ncommitment of all Member States in an open, inclusive \r\nand transparent way that will allow for everyone’s \r\nparticipation, without exception, as we build a Security \r\nCouncil that is representative of the new realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nMr. Alday González (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAs we take one more step in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process, Mexico welcomes this meeting \r\nand the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas as the \r\nnew facilitator of the deliberations on Security Council \r\nreform. We give her all our support and willingness \r\nto work towards a common objective and a result that \r\nwill be acceptable tor all. I also take this opportunity \r\nto thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray for the long \r\nhours he invested in this exercise.\r\nThe sixty-ninth session has a record full of \r\ncontrasts. The participation of Member States in the \r\nprocess revealed without a doubt our ongoing interest \r\nin changing the status quo. But at the same time, \r\ncontributions to the debate revealed that we still have \r\ndeep divisions on the form and substance of Security \r\nCouncil reform. \r\nFor more than two decades, we have discussed \r\nvarious reform models under a number of modalities, \r\nnone of which has been able to garner the necessary \r\nsupport for enactment. The meeting to discuss \r\nSecurity Council reform held in Rome in May clearly \r\ndemonstrated the inclination of many countries, \r\nincluding the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, to explore alternative approaches, such as the \r\none that Mexico and the Uniting for Consensus group \r\nhave been promoting. We are offering a compromise \r\nsolution, one that could be endorsed by the greatest \r\nnumber of Member States without trying to impose \r\na formula with a predetermined outcome in terms of \r\nseats.\r\nWe cannot advocate and encourage democratic \r\nprocesses around the world collectively and at the same \r\ntime support broadening the privileges for some in the \r\nexecutive body of our Organization. Mexico and the \r\nUniting for Consensus group are fighting for a reform \r\nformula that will bring to 26 the number of members \r\nof the Council, with five additional seats for two years \r\n15-34312 9/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nand six seats that, based on the principle of equitable \r\ngeographical distribution, are to be occupied with longer \r\nmandates and the possibility of immediate re-election. \r\nThat formula would allow for a decision-making process \r\nthat would be more democratic and efficient and would \r\nreconcile the aspirations of everyone, thereby adjusting \r\nthe composition of the Council to the new regional \r\nrealities and ensuring States wanting to serve more \r\nfrequently in the Council a larger presence than usual.\r\nAs Latin Americans, we perfectly understand the \r\naspirations of the Group of African States for equitable \r\nrepresentation, which would allow them to play the role \r\nin the Council that should be theirs. We understand \r\ntheir legitimate claim as an expression of the strength \r\nthat unity and consensus grant them, and not as an \r\nindividual aspiration for power and privilege.\r\nSecurity Council reform is a process that can be \r\nguided solely by all of the States Members of the United \r\nNations and not just by some. If the practice persists of \r\ngranting privileges in perpetuity to some States in order \r\nto satisfy national ambitions to the detriment of the \r\ncollective interests, we will not achieve our objective. \r\nThe lack of transparency and of uniform consultations \r\nwith all stakeholders in the process that we witnessed \r\nduring the previous session did not help in smoothing \r\nover our differences, and it generated an environment \r\nof mistrust and secrecy, such as we already see in \r\nthe dynamics between the permanent members of the \r\nCouncil and the rest.\r\nOver the course of years of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, we have noted that the most important \r\nquality of a facilitator is to know how to listen to \r\nthe positions of all Member States with impartiality, \r\ntransparency and objectivity and, on that basis, to \r\ndetermine the path that will allow us to generate \r\nagreements toward a solution that will have the broadest \r\npossible support.\r\nIn that spirit, we would respectfully ask the \r\nfacilitator that whatever document or schedule is used \r\nto guide our deliberations during this session, it be \r\ndiscussed ahead of time with the major negotiating \r\ngroups with absolute transparency and under equal \r\nconditions. Only in that way can we start with common \r\npositions and understandings. We trust that, in full \r\nawareness of the divergent positions on the topic, the \r\nable leadership of the facilitator and of the President \r\nof the General Assembly will lead us to a compromise \r\nsolution that we will all welcome.\r\nMr. Abdrakhmanov (Kazakhstan): At the outset, \r\nthe delegation of Kazakhstan expresses its gratitude for \r\nthe hard work and enthusiasm of Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, and his \r\nteam for coordinating and providing momentum to the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We also take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg on her \r\nappointment as Chair of this session’s intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the topic and assure her of our full \r\nsupport.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is an important \r\npart of the overall process of reform of the United \r\nNations aimed at enhancing its response capabilities \r\nto deal with current complex and multidimensional \r\nissues. That process should be implemented on the \r\nbasis of consensus in accordance with the goals and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and in \r\na way reflecting the views of all Member States. We \r\nnote with satisfaction that, despite the various points of \r\nview, there is a common understanding that, whatever \r\nthe new configuration of the Security Council might \r\nbe, it must function actively and effectively to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe support a comprehensive approach to Security \r\nCouncil reform that seeks to address all key issues, such \r\nas expanding the Security Council membership, first \r\nof all, including permanent and non-permanent seats \r\nfor the Group of African States, improving its working \r\nmethods and addressing the questions of the veto and \r\nthe Council’s relationship with the General Assembly.\r\nThe issue of sanctions is also a very important \r\npart of the work of the Council. As the President of \r\nKazakhstan stated in the Assembly’s general debate \r\nlast month:\r\n“It is crucial to prevent the arbitrary imposition \r\nof sanctions, which contradicts both the Charter \r\nand international law. I am convinced that the \r\nright to impose international sanctions, which \r\ncan adversely affect the well-being of millions of \r\npeople, should remain the exclusive prerogative of \r\nthe Security Council.” (A/70/PV.13, p. 47)\r\nGiven the major responsibilities of the Council and \r\nthe Assembly, improved cooperation between those two \r\nprinciple organs is absolutely essential. That could be \r\nachieved through regular consultations between the \r\nPresidents of the main bodies and by increasing the \r\nfrequency of the qualitative reports and evaluations \r\n10/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nof the Council’s work to the General Assembly on an \r\nongoing basis and by improving the Council’s annual \r\nreport. \r\nThe establishment of arbitrary deadlines for reform \r\nshould be avoided. Any solution needs to be mature \r\nand carefully considered. However, unnecessary delays \r\nmight be equally dangerous and harmful.\r\nTo move the negotiations forward demands a new \r\nunderstanding aimed at breaching the divergences in \r\nviews among the vast number of Member States and \r\ntheir political orientations and national interests. \r\nWe therefore call for a spirit of compromise and \r\ninclusiveness, so as to gain the widest possible common \r\nground. The proposals with regard to the veto power, \r\nwith all its implications, should be carefully studied, \r\nand a viable and mutually acceptable solution must be \r\nfound soon.\r\nWe believe that a change in working methods \r\ndoes not require an amendment to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, nor a two-thirds favourable majority \r\nof Members to be adopted. Kazakhstan is also of the \r\nview that an improvement in the working methods will \r\nnot limit the power of the Council or subordinate it to \r\nthe General Assembly, but will rather strengthen the \r\nSecurity Council to make it more efficient.\r\nThe Charter specifies that the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council are equal bodies. Therefore \r\ngreater dialogue and collaboration between the \r\ntwo will enhance the effectiveness of both entities, \r\nespecially the Council, as it gains new perspectives \r\nfrom the Assembly’s wider membership. At the same \r\ntime, many countries that have little or no power in the \r\nCouncil see the General Assembly as their only avenue \r\nfor influencing the United Nations. Since the most \r\nimportant decision that the Council will make in 2016 \r\nis the election of the next Secretary-General, we believe \r\nthat the slate of candidates should be shared with the \r\nGeneral Assembly, so that it can have a greater say in \r\nthe selection for that highest office, which should be \r\nbased on merit of the highest order.\r\nWhat is most needed is not just reforms, but changed \r\nattitudes. The national interests of Member States \r\nmust be balanced with greater objectivity and global \r\nperspectives. We believe that the Council would also \r\nbenefit from greater dialogue with the United Nations \r\nsystem, regional organizations and specialized security \r\nentities, as well as with specialized institutions and \r\ncivil society, which often play a key role in maintaining \r\npeace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Kazakhstan’s commitment \r\nto engage in the intergovernmental negotiations and \r\nwork in a spirit of compromise and cooperation to \r\nswiftly finalize the reform of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Çevik (Turkey): We align ourselves with the \r\nstatement delivered by the Permanent Representative of \r\nItaly on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group (see \r\nA/70/PV.43). The following are some additional points \r\npresented in my national capacity.\r\nOur appreciation goes to Ambassador Rattray for \r\nhis contributions to our deliberations last year, and we \r\nwelcome and congratulate Ambassador Lucas on her \r\nappointment. We look forward to working closely with \r\nher.\r\nWe are starting a new round of negotiations on \r\none of the most critical matters on the agenda of our \r\nOrganization. Almost all of us agree that reform is \r\nneeded and, indeed, that it is urgent. The statements \r\ntoday on the need for reform are not mere rhetorical \r\nexpressions. With every single day we spend on this \r\nmatter, we bear the responsibility for the sufferings of \r\nmillions stemming from the structural shortcomings of \r\nthe current system. That is a disturbing reality, which \r\nrecalls the moral obligations the we all bear to champion \r\nequality and accountability on every front.\r\nReform is a forward-looking concept that seeks \r\nto make changes for improvement. It is not a static \r\nconcept. Therefore, if a change is to be called reform, it \r\nmust address the shortcomings, rather than consolidate \r\nexisting problems. That is the basic but critical aspect \r\non which our proposals for reform differ. Obviously, it \r\nis the permanent membership issue and the question of \r\nthe veto that cause many of the problems today. We still \r\ndo not have an answer to the simple question of what \r\nthe added value will be if we increase the number of the \r\ndefective elements in the system.\r\nWith that understanding, we are for a meaningful \r\nand principled reform that would bring about a more \r\ndemocratic, representative, effective, transparent and \r\naccountable Council. We think that that can be achieved \r\nby increasing only the number of elected members of \r\nthe Council. For those aspiring to longer service in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, we \r\nare proposing a longer-term seat with the possibility \r\nof re-election. Ideally, the veto should be abolished. \r\n15-34312 11/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nWe welcome the initiatives to limit the use of negative \r\nvotes in cases of mass atrocities.\r\nMore equitable representation of regional groups, \r\nincluding enhanced opportunities for those that are \r\nmore vulnerable, is a must for a reformed Council.\r\nThe Council’s working methods and relationship \r\nwith the General Assembly are no less important, \r\nsince they define the daily dynamics of the system. \r\nIn that regard, only a comprehensive approach can be \r\nsuccessful if we are to address the whole package of \r\ninterrelated aspects of this issue.\r\nIt is natural to have different views about the \r\nsolutions to a problem. However, in order to be able \r\nto proceed with negotiations, we must be on the same \r\npage, working for the same goal. Needless to say, an \r\nissue that has a direct impact on the lives of today’s \r\ngenerations and those of the future requires a general \r\nspirit of compromise and a process of consensus.\r\nMr. Ja Song Nam (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nclarify the views and positions of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea on the issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nOn the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nfounding of the United Nations, it is very important to \r\nreflect on its essential mission and role in the context of \r\nreform of the Security Council. Born out of the demise \r\nof fascism and militarism, the United Nations saw the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security as the motive for its \r\nestablishment, as well as the purpose of its existence \r\nand its fundamental principle. \r\nThe first sentence of the Preamble to the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations,\r\n“We the peoples of the United Nations, \r\ndetermined to save succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war, which twice in our lifetime has \r\nbrought untold sorrow to mankind”,\r\ntells us the very meaning of the purpose of founding \r\nthe United Nations. The role of the Security Council \r\nis crucial to fulfilling the Organization’s mission of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, because \r\nthe Council, along with the General Assembly, has the \r\nspecial function of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, as provided for in the Charter.\r\nHowever, when we raise the question as to whether \r\nthe Security Council is truly fulfilling its responsibility \r\nand role as stipulated in the Charter and in accordance \r\nwith the demands of the international community, the \r\nanswer is far from what we should expect, based on \r\ntoday’s reality. History continues to advance, and the \r\nexpectations and demands for peace and security of the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations and the peoples \r\nof the world are greater than ever. And yet the Security \r\nCouncil’s attitude, particularly to international and \r\nregional issues, is still mired in the Cold War era. The \r\nmost disappointing and even dangerous fact is that \r\nsome members of the Council with permanent vested \r\ninterests use issues concerning international affairs \r\nand the sovereignty of United Nations Member States \r\nto recklessly pursue their own interests, based on their \r\nindividual purposes and views. The Security Council’s \r\nmisconduct in dealing with issues relating to the Korean \r\npeninsula is a typical example.\r\nEvery year the United States of America conducts a \r\nnumber of large-scale military exercises in South Korea \r\nand beyond, mobilizing massive armed forces and all \r\nkinds of strategic nuclear strike equipment in what \r\nare in fact nuclear war games against the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. This year, facing such \r\nmilitary threats from the world’s largest nuclear-weapon \r\nState, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\nrepeatedly requested that the Security Council include \r\nthe United States joint military exercises as an item on \r\nits agenda. The exercises, which include every means \r\nrequired for a nuclear strike, are serious military \r\nprovocations, aimed at igniting a second Korean War \r\nand with the purpose of occupying Pyongyang, the \r\ncapital of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nThat is why the problem is no longer confined to \r\nrelations between the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea and the United States or between the two Koreas. \r\nIt is an international issue that threatens peace and \r\nsecurity in North-East Asia and beyond.\r\nThe Security Council has nevertheless ignored the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s reasonable \r\nrequests, which are directly related to international \r\npeace and security. Indeed, on the contrary, it has \r\noppressed the sovereign rights of an independent State \r\nby making an issue of its legitimate right to explore \r\nouter space for a peaceful purpose and terming it a so-\r\ncalled human rights issue by linking it indissolubly to \r\nmatters of peace and security. \r\nThe Security Council has shown its true colours as \r\nit has become a political tool of certain countries and \r\ngiven up its primary mission of maintaining genuine \r\n12/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\npeace and security. That is why, more than ever, there \r\nis a continuing demand and necessity for Security \r\nCouncil reform. The situation today testifies to the \r\nfact that international peace and security can never \r\nbe maintained unless we reform the anachronistic \r\nstructure, double standards and working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is of \r\nthe view that Security Council reform should be guided \r\nin a direction that will ensure that the old system is \r\nrestructured and that the new system is able to fully \r\nguarantee the sovereignty and right to development, \r\npeace and security of all Member States in an equal \r\nand impartial manner, based on the principle of respect \r\nfor their sovereign equality.\r\nFirst, in reforming the Security Council, the \r\nprinciples of impartiality, objectivity and democracy, \r\nas well as of the full representation of all Member \r\nStates and of consensus, should be fully applied and \r\nguaranteed. The Council should consistently reject \r\ncertain countries’ high-handedness and pursuit of \r\ntheir own purposes, as well as arbitrariness and double \r\nstandards. A strict mechanism should be introduced \r\ninto the Council’s new structure designed to ensure \r\nthat Council resolutions and decisions related to \r\nsanctions or the use of force that could seriously affect \r\ninternational peace and security can go into effect only \r\nafter final authorization by the General Assembly, \r\nwhich represents the full membership of the United \r\nNations.\r\nSecondly, the composition of the Council should be \r\nbased on the principle of ensuring the full representation \r\nof member States of the Non-Aligned Movement and \r\nother developing countries. Since such States form \r\nthe majority of the membership of the United Nations, \r\nit cannot be a matter for debate that they should be \r\nrepresented accordingly in the Security Council. \r\nAs we have seen during the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiation process on Security Council reform, the \r\nprospects for enlarging the Council’s permanent \r\nmembership are not good, owing to the seriously \r\ndivided views of Member States. Under those \r\ncircumstances, therefore, and in view of the urgent \r\nneed for reform, a preferable and viable solution for \r\nredressing the Council’s unbalanced and unreasonable \r\nstructure would be to begin by enlarging the category \r\nof its non-permanent members.\r\nThirdly, reform of the Security Council should be \r\ninstituted neither for its own sake nor in order to serve \r\nthe purposes and interests of a few particular countries. \r\nIt should be true reform that can enable the Council \r\nto make a genuine contribution to maintaining lasting \r\ninternational peace and security, responding to the \r\ncommon interests and demands of the overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States, in accordance with changed \r\nrealities. In that regard, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is seriously concerned about the \r\nbehaviour of Japan, which is itself unusually eager for \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nAlthough 70 years have passed since the establishment \r\nof the United Nations, based on its determination to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war, \r\nthe wounds and misfortunes of that war are yet to be \r\nfully healed. They still fester deeply in the hearts of \r\nthe victims and other peoples who suffered in that war. \r\nThat is because Japan, which provoked that war and \r\ncommitted terrible, inhumane crimes during the war, \r\nhas not only failed to liquidate its shameful past but \r\nalso has no intention to do so. On the contrary, Japan, \r\nwhich should be taking the road of peace, is taking the \r\nroad of reviving militarism in the very year that marks \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the defeat of Japanese \r\nmilitarism.\r\nIn its statement issued in August, on the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the defeat of imperial Japan, the Japanese \r\nGovernment openly revealed that it will no longer settle \r\nits past war crimes against the Asian nations. To make \r\nmatters worse, it is turning Japan into a country that \r\ncan make war by revising its Constitution. Japanese \r\nmilitarism is once again on the rise. By disguising its \r\npursuit of militarism with a rhetorical contribution \r\nto peacekeeping and by seeking to be included in \r\nthe expanded permanent membership of the Security \r\nCouncil, Japan is attempting to erase its shameful past \r\nand inhumane war crimes. That is why Japan is so \r\ninterested in Security Council reform.\r\nJapan is the one and only country that committed \r\nState-sponsored crimes of military sexual slavery \r\nagainst hundreds of thousands of Korean women and \r\nwomen of other nations during the Second World War. \r\nBut it is still refusing to make a sincere apology and \r\nto offer compensation to the victims. Japan, which \r\ndenies its crimes of sexual slavery, has no right to \r\ntake a seat on a Security Council that attaches great \r\nimportance to women and peace and security. We need \r\nto look back in history and look ahead to the future. \r\n15-34312 13/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nWe should be prudent enough to realize that if Japan’s \r\nattempt to become a new permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council is allowed, there will be disastrous \r\nconsequences for current and future generations.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea hopes \r\nthat Security Council reform will be guided in the right \r\ndirection. We will continue to actively engage in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform.\r\nMr. Luque Márquez (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFor Ecuador, as for the great majority of Members of \r\nthe United Nations, reform of the Security Council \r\nis urgently needed in order to make this body more \r\ndemocratic, transparent and effective and to bring \r\nit into line with the realities of today’s world and the \r\nmembership of the Organization. To be lasting, such \r\nreform must be comprehensive and must avoid creating \r\na static configuration of the Council that would be \r\noutdated in a few decades, as is the case now, when this \r\nbody reflects the geopolitical realities of 70 years ago. \r\nWe should be able to design a Security Council that will \r\nnot require further discussions on new reforms in 20, \r\n30 or 40 years’ time.\r\nFor Ecuador, the reform process must continue \r\nto be guided by the five principal themes set out in \r\ndecision 62/557, of 15 September 2008: categories \r\nof membership; the question of the veto; regional \r\nrepresentation; the size of the Security Council and \r\nits working methods; and the relationship between the \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly. On that last point, \r\nI must repeat that my country rejects attempts by the \r\nCouncil to assume tasks that the Charter expressly \r\nassigned to the General Assembly and its subsidiary \r\nbodies or to the Economic and Social Council. Reform, \r\nin the end, needs to be comprehensive and must advance \r\nthose five themes to be effective.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the consensual \r\nadoption, on 14 September, of decision 69/560. We \r\nconsider that, without prejudging the final form that \r\neventual reform might take, it is important that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiating process be conducted \r\nand continue on the basis of consensus. We believe that \r\nthe best way to ensure the greatest possible convergence \r\nof positions is that the process itself should proceed on \r\na consensual basis that takes into account the positions \r\nand opinions of all Member States in a spirit of mutual \r\nrespect. A possible and effective reform of the Security \r\nCouncil should be the outcome of the convergence of all \r\nopinions that have been expressed on this fundamental \r\ntopic. In that regard, we must always bear in mind \r\nthe requirements of the Charter for its own reform, \r\nincluding approval in the Assembly and the number of \r\nratifications required.\r\nWhile we acknowledge the usefulness of the \r\nrestatement of the positions of some Member States \r\ncontained in the letter and its annexes circulated on \r\n31 July by His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, President \r\nof the Assembly at the sixty-ninth session, we must \r\nbear in mind that that compiliation does not reflect \r\nthe criteria of all Member States and therefore cannot \r\nbe considered the definitive or final  expression of the \r\nmembership of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, as we express our appreciation for \r\nthe work by the Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica, Mr. Courtenay Rattray, who chaired the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the sixty-ninth \r\nsession, we also wish to welcome the appointment of the \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas, to guide that process during the current \r\nsession. We offer her our support and cooperation.\r\nMr. Kullane (Somalia): Somalia associates itself \r\nwith the statement made by His Excellency Mr. Vandi \r\nMinah of Sierra Leone on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States (see A/70/PV.43).\r\nOver the past decade, the Security Council has \r\nbeen of great assistance in Somalia’s steady progress \r\ninto peace, which the Somali people deeply appreciate. \r\nSomalia commends the Council for its critical work \r\nin discharging its responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. The Security \r\nCouncil’s efforts in working closely with the Federal \r\nGovernment of Somalia contributed to our trajectory as \r\nwe moved from State failure to State-building.\r\nThe Security Council’s ability to adequately address \r\nthe challenges to international peace and security \r\ndirectly affects the lives of millions of people around \r\nthe world. We must measure the effectiveness of the \r\nCouncil through the outcomes that it obtains in terms \r\nof both conflict prevention and conflict resolution. \r\nWe believe that there is no limit to perfection and \r\nthat there is always room for improving the working \r\nmethods of any organization. There is a requirement to \r\nreform the Security Council, its working methods and \r\nits collaboration with other United Nations organs to \r\nenable it to better react to contemporary realities.\r\n14/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nWe welcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas of Luxembourg as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, and we also sincerely thank the outgoing \r\nChair, Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, for his \r\ntremendous work. \r\nWe are pleased that last month the General Assembly \r\nwas able to adopt by consensus decision 69/560, which \r\nformally recognizes the text and its annex circulated \r\non 31 July as the basis for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations.\r\nWe welcome the improved cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the regional and subregional \r\norganizations. That cooperation should be an ongoing \r\nand dynamic process, so that its advantages can be \r\nreflected in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. We encourage closer cooperation between \r\nthe African Union Peace and Security Council and the \r\nSecurity Council under the provisions of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, with a view to delivering and \r\nimplementing more effective, strategic decisions.\r\nToday, 8 out of the 18 United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions are deployed in Africa. Therefore, it is \r\nobvious that Africa, with its 54 Member States, cannot \r\nremain the only continent that has neither a permanent \r\nseat nor the veto power. The legitimacy and credibility \r\nof the Security Council and the effectiveness of its \r\naction will depend on its ability to evolve and adapt \r\nto modern changes and representation. The current \r\nunderrepresentation of Africa is clear evidence of the \r\nabsence of impartiality in the Security Council. \r\nMoreover, we consider it unacceptable that in the \r\ntwenty-first century, the United Nations allows the \r\nuse of the veto in situations involving crimes against \r\nhumanity, war crimes or genocide. Owing to such \r\ncircumstances, we support a comprehensive reform that \r\nwill ref lect the current geographical realities.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): I would like to thank \r\nthe President for his leadership in the reform process \r\nand for convening this debate ahead of the new cycle \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform. Allow me also to use this opportunity \r\nto congratulate warmly Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, on her \r\nappointment as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and to sincerely thank her predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, for his able chairmanship \r\nand professional competence, thanks to which we \r\naccomplished outstanding work under his leadership.\r\nCroatia shares the views of the majority of Member \r\nStates that the present structure and functioning of \r\nthe Council do not properly reflect the geopolitical \r\nrealities of the contemporary world or the make-up \r\nof the United Nations membership in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. Therefore, in order to maintain the Council’s \r\nauthority, relevance and indispensability in maintaining \r\nglobal peace and security, we cannot afford to further \r\npostpone its reform. \r\nIt has been said many times, but it is worth \r\nrepeating, that it took only 18 years from the foundation \r\nof the United Nations for the General Assembly to adopt \r\nresolution 1991 (XVIII), on the Security Council’s \r\nfirst — and to date, last — enlargement, in 1963. On \r\n1 January 2016, we shall mark the fiftieth anniversary \r\nof the beginning of the 15-member Council. That fact \r\nalone speaks volumes about our effectiveness and \r\nability to embrace and implement reform. Furthermore, \r\nsome of the provisions of resolution 1991 (XVIII) \r\nare as relevant today as they were 52 years ago, on. \r\n17 December 1963, in that “the present composition of \r\nthe Security Council is inequitable and unbalanced”, \r\nand that  it is \r\n“necessary to enlarge the membership of the \r\nSecurity Council, thus ... making it a more effective \r\norgan for carrying out its functions under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations”.\r\nWith respect to the substance of our debate, \r\nCroatia is of the view that the time has come to move \r\nforward. Our position on Security Council reform is \r\nwell known. We support the Council’s enlargement \r\nin both permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership. We believe that the Group of Eastern \r\nEuropean States should be awarded an additional seat \r\nin the non-permanent category of membership of the \r\nreformed Council, since the membership of the Group \r\nhas more than doubled in the past 50 years, from 10 \r\nto 23 countries. We also advocate greater African \r\nrepresentation in the enlarged Council.\r\nThe working methods of the enlarged Council \r\nshould be such as to facilitate more efficient, effective \r\nand accountable functioning. Croatia supports more \r\nfrequent interaction by the members of the Council \r\nwith wider United Nations membership, through \r\ngreater transparency, openness in decision-making and \r\ninclusiveness. On the question of the use of the veto, \r\n15-34312 15/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nCroatia welcomes the initiatives on restraining the use \r\nof the veto in situations of war crimes, mass atrocities \r\nand genocide. Regarding the inter-institutional relations \r\nbetween the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, Croatia would like to see regular consultations \r\ntaking place between the Presidents of these two pivotal \r\nbodies.\r\nWe fully understand that the widest support possible \r\nof Member States is essential for such a momentous \r\nreform as that of Security Council enlargement. \r\nNevertheless, our continuous efforts to broaden that \r\nsupport should not mean that consensus, no matter how \r\ndesirable it is in all United Nations reform processes, \r\nis a necessary precondition for further advancement in \r\nSecurity Council reform. Therefore, we should follow \r\nthe practice that, when consensus is apparently not \r\npossible, the position of a convincing majority should \r\nbe used as a way forward. \r\nWe extend our full support to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly and the new Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We are confident that \r\nunder their able leadership, that process will bring us \r\ncloser to our common goal of a reformed and improved \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): My delegation \r\nwould like to welcome the appointment of Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, \r\nas the new Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nWe have every confidence in her ability to facilitate \r\nthat difficult process with the high degree of fairness \r\nand transparency that she has displayed in many other \r\nof her United Nations functions.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Italy on behalf of \r\nthe Uniting for Consensus group (see A/70/PV.43).\r\nFor its part, the Republic of Korea has consistently \r\ncalled for the reform of the Security Council as an \r\nimportant and urgent matter. The Council must be \r\nreformed in a way that will allow it to better address the \r\ninternational peace and security challenges of today. We \r\nbelieve that such reform cannot be accomplished until \r\nwe do away with the outdated concepts of permanency \r\nand veto. To put it simply, in this fast-changing world, \r\nnothing should be unchangeable. What we need is \r\na modern, democratic and f lexible mechanism, a \r\nmechanism that can reflect dynamic international \r\nrealities in a timely manner.\r\nIncreasing non-permanent seats through periodic \r\nelections is the only logical solution to achieve that \r\ngoal. Expanding the number of elected members will \r\nbring a better balance to the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil, thereby improving its work. Permanency \r\ndoes not allow the Council to adapt to changes in the \r\nworld and to effectively address global challenges. In \r\nthat regard, we support the French-Mexican political \r\nstatement on the suspension of the use of the veto \r\nin cases of mass atrocities and the code of conduct \r\nregarding Security Council action against genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nAt the same time, we do recognize the aspirations \r\nof some Member States to make a more prominent \r\ncontribution to the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. To accommodate such aspirations, we \r\nsupport the creation of longer-term, re-electable seats \r\nto allow those Member States to sit on the Council \r\nlonger and more often. But of course, their continued \r\ndedication and performance should be ensured through \r\nperiodic elections.\r\nWith regard to the way forward, an important \r\nlesson that should be drawn from previous rounds of \r\nnegotiations is that any reform formula must receive the \r\nwide support of Member States. We need to strive for \r\nconsensus, as stipulated in Assembly decision 62/557, \r\nto address this critical matter. We also need to engage \r\non the broader issue of improving the effectiveness and \r\ncredibility of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation stands ready to work with others to \r\nformulate an innovative and pragmatic solution that \r\ncan garner the support and understanding of the entire \r\nmembership.\r\nMrs. Martinic (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me at the outset to express our gratitude for the \r\nconvening of this meeting. \r\nArgentina aligns itself with the statement made by \r\nthe representative of Italy on behalf of the Uniting for \r\nConsensus group (see A/70/PV.43).\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray, facilitator of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the previous session. We do not \r\ndoubt his good intentions in taking a heterodox approach \r\nto carrying out our work. We congratulate Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas on her appointment as facilitator for the \r\ncurrent session. She can count on the full cooperation \r\n16/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nof my delegation in working constructively on the issue \r\nbefore us.\r\nAs we have done throughout this process, today we \r\nare once again tackling our work in awareness of the \r\nneed for a spirit of f lexibility and agreement and a strong \r\nmultilateral approach, as that is the only guarantee of \r\nsuccess. Argentina trusts that all delegations will do the \r\nsame, because it is only through a multilateral approach \r\nthat is based on concrete actions and leadership, taking \r\ninto account the interests of all nations, that we will \r\nbe able to achieve a Security Council that is more \r\ndemocratic, truly inclusive and efficient, and one \r\nthat can properly discharge the heavy responsibilities \r\nconferred on it by the Charter.\r\nIt is clear that as a democratic institution, the United \r\nNations constantly faces the need to build legitimacy \r\nand representativity in its organs. This task falls to \r\nthe Member States and thus cannot and should not be \r\ndelegated. Therefore it is only in the framework of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations undertaken by Member \r\nStates in good faith, on the basis of mutual respect \r\nand in an open, inclusive and transparent manner, as \r\nestablished by the General Assembly in resolutions \r\n48/26 and 53/30 and decision 62/557, that we will \r\nbe able to find a solution that will find the broadest \r\npossible political acceptance.\r\nBased on the lessons learned during this negotiating \r\nprocess, Argentina continues, in a spirit of great \r\nwillingness, to devise innovative and consistent \r\nformulas that will ensure a more democratic presence, \r\na more effective rotation process for non-permanent \r\nmembers and a reformulation of its working methods, \r\nso that the Council can truly become more transparent, \r\ninteractive and inclusive. \r\nThe Charter stipulates in Article 24 that:\r\n“In order to ensure prompt and effective action \r\nby the United Nations, its Members confer on the \r\nSecurity Council primary responsibility for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, \r\nand agree that in carrying out its duties under this \r\nresponsibility the Security Council acts on their \r\nbehalf.”\r\nThe victors in the Second World War arrogated this \r\nresponsibility to themselves on a permanent basis. \r\nHowever, all States that recognize that peace is an \r\nessential element for their development wish to actively \r\nundertake out this responsibility.\r\nArgentina is in favour of an increase in the \r\nnumber of non-permanent members only, because \r\nperpetuity is intrinsically antagonistic to the notion of \r\nrepresentativity in a democratic context, where such \r\nrepresentativity must periodically be legitimized by the \r\nwill of those represented.\r\nIt is well known that elections form the basis of \r\nall legitimate democratic and representative systems. \r\nThe improvement of the working methods has been and \r\nremains of the greatest importance to Argentina.  When \r\nwe held the chairmanship of the Security Council’s \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions, we took every opportunity to \r\npromote transparency and openness in the work of that \r\nGroup, as well as its accountability for its actions to the \r\nOrganization as a whole.\r\nTo conclude, Argentina reiterates its intention \r\nto consider with an open mind all proposals that, \r\nrespecting the principles agreed upon by the General \r\nAssembly, bring together the positions in order to \r\nmake concrete the necessary democratic reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Ramírez Carreño (Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela) (spoke in Spanish): Venezuela deeply \r\nappreciates the efforts by Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica and \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations on reform \r\nof the Security Council during the sixty-ninth session of \r\nthe General Assembly. We welcome Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as \r\nthe new Chair and wish her every success.\r\nAfter more than two decades of debate on reform \r\nof the Security Council, the United Nations could see \r\nits credibility affected if the prolonged standstill in the \r\nnegotiating process continues. My country believes \r\nthat it is time to move to a substantive process based \r\non a draft negotiating text in order to achieve tangible \r\nresults. We believe that expansion of the membership of \r\nthe Security Council, the reform of its working methods \r\nand the review of the decision-making mechanism, \r\nincluding the issue of the veto, should lead to a more \r\ndemocratic, representative, transparent and effective \r\nCouncil.\r\nWith regard to the composition of the Council, \r\nwe are in favour of its expansion. We are convinced \r\nthat the process of reform must ensure the inclusion \r\nof developing countries in the regions of Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean, and Asia. An expanded \r\n15-34312 17/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nSecurity Council should include different geographical, \r\npolitical and cultural realities, mainly those of the \r\ndeveloping world, taking into account the need to \r\ncorrect the power asymmetry in that body and adapt it to \r\nthe multipolar world that is emerging, making it a more \r\ndemocratic and representative organ. The developing \r\ncountries have a right to longer-term participation in \r\nthe Security Council, as well as to the re-election of its \r\nnon-permanent members, using the experience of other \r\norgans of the United Nations systemas a basis.\r\nIn this context, we must address the legitimate \r\naspirations of the African continent, which is composed \r\nof 54 countries, in order to rectify the historical injustice \r\nwith respect to its representation on the Council. African \r\ncountries make up more than a quarter of the Members \r\nof the Organization, and thef  conflict situations under \r\nconsideration by the Council that affect the continent \r\ncomprise more than two thirds of the Council’s agenda.\r\nWith respect to working methods, our delegation \r\nwould like to express its deepest concern at the \r\nperpetual provisional status of the Security Council’s \r\nrules of procedure. It is unacceptable that, 70 years after \r\nits founding, it does not have a definitive set of rules. It \r\nis clear that the purpose of the arrangement has been to \r\nfavour a small group of permanent members that, under \r\nthe guise of a supposedly rules-based practice, does, \r\nor does not do, as it wishes. My delegation condemns \r\nthe practice whereby the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council often hold negotiations behind closed \r\ndoors, thus excluding non-permanent members of the \r\nCouncil from its decision-making process. Similarly, \r\ndisproportionate power is enjoyed by a few permanent \r\nmembers, the so-called penholders, which gives them a \r\nmonopoly on the scope and wording of the resolutions.\r\nThe sanctions committees should have no other aim \r\nthan to contribute to the paramount goal of reaching \r\npolitical solutions to conflicts. Unfortunately, in \r\npractice, some permanent members perceive sanctions \r\nregimes as ends in themselves and under that premise \r\nseek to keep expanding their mandates and scope \r\ninto new areas in an undefined manner, without even \r\nconsulting, listening to or taking into account the views \r\nof the countries affected, thereby undermining any \r\npurpose or policy objective that the sanctions may have \r\nhad when they were first conceived.\r\nVenezuela calls for a substantial increase in open \r\nmeetings. Closed meetings, including consultations, \r\nmust be an exception to the requirement of public \r\nmeetings, as set out in rule 48 of the Council’s provisional \r\nrules of procedure. We cannot allow the continuation \r\nof the practice of holding meetings for which there is \r\nno record, no verbatim report, no minutes. Nor can \r\nwe continue to allow the exclusion of the countries \r\naffected and the relevant regional organizations from \r\nparticipating in discussions on the agenda items that \r\naffect them, which happened last April when the Council \r\nrefused to let the High Representative of the African \r\nUnion participate in the briefing on the question of \r\nWestern Sahara, or last May when the African Union’s \r\nPermanent Observer was excluded from the briefing on \r\nthe situation of migrants in the Mediterranean. Open \r\nmeetings of the Council help to promote transparency \r\nand inclusiveness and give the entire United Nations \r\nmembership the opportunity to contribute to the \r\nCouncil’s work. It is mainly through such meetings that \r\nthe Council obtains information about the position of \r\ncountries on the items on its agenda.\r\nWith respect to the Security Council’s decision-\r\nmaking mechanisms, Venezuela believes that the \r\nissue of the veto should be the subject of a thorough \r\ndiscussion. In the case of such topics or issues as the \r\nelection of the Secretary-General or the admission of \r\nnew Member States, where the General Assembly is \r\nalso an important participant, the permanent members \r\nshould refrain from using the veto. Unfortunately, in \r\nthis regard, the Council’s Committee on the Admission \r\nof New Members has been unable to give a positive \r\nrecommendation for the admission of the State of \r\nPalestine as a full Member of the Organization, owing \r\nto the denial of one of its permanent members.\r\nVenezuela rejects the continued efforts of the \r\nSecurity Council to use the thematic debates as a way \r\nto expand its mandate into areas that do not represent \r\na threat to international peace and security. The role of \r\nthe Assembly as the main forum for the discussion and \r\nformulation of United Nations policies and legislation \r\nmust be respected in terms of both spirit and purpose. \r\nWe wish to reaffirm the need for the Security Council \r\nreport to the General Assembly to be more explanatory \r\nand analytical in describing its work.\r\nTo conclude, we must emphasize that the reform \r\nof the Security Council represents just one element \r\nof a necessary, broader and more comprehensive \r\nreform of the United Nations, which includes, among \r\nother organs, the Secretariat. In this connection, we \r\nemphasize the need for appointments to high posts in \r\nthe Organization to be handled fairly and equitably \r\n18/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nin terms of geographical distribution, so that all \r\ncountries, particularly those in the developing world, \r\nhave appropriate opportunities to participate in the \r\norgans that prepare the reports and documents that are \r\nsubmitted to the Security Council for consideration.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): I thank \r\nthe President for convening this debate. We believe that \r\nmaking the necessary arrangements for a successful \r\ndebate and fruitfully conducting the upcoming \r\nnegotiations on the sensitive and important issue of \r\nSecurity Council reform require extensive consultations \r\nwith all Member States. We welcome and congratulate \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg as the new \r\nChair of intergovernmental negotiations and assure her \r\nof our support.\r\nWith its current, extremely outdated composition \r\nand working methods, the Security Council has been \r\nunable to fulfil its crucial responsibility of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. The entire membership \r\nsupports the goal of having a more representative, \r\neffective, democratic, accountable and transparent \r\nCouncil. The question is how do we reach that goal.\r\nAt the sixty-second session of the General \r\nAssembly, the United Nations membership embarked \r\non the process of intergovernmental negotiations, \r\npursuant to decision 62/557. The decision directs the \r\nAssembly to achieve holistic reform on five key issues: \r\ncategories of membership, the veto, size and working \r\nmethods, regional representation, and the relationship \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly and other important bodies. The Council’s \r\nexpansion is one of the elements of the overall reform \r\nbut must not diminish the importance of the other four \r\nelements; all five are linked. We believe that no Council \r\nreform can succeed unless all five interrelated issues \r\nare appropriately, comprehensively and inclusively \r\naddressed.\r\nThere have been many initiatives to change the \r\ncomposition or improve the working methods or \r\ndecision-making processes of the Council. But so far \r\nall of them have failed, and nothing significant has \r\nbeen done to restore trust in this important organ. We \r\nbelieve that any attempt at genuine Security Council \r\nreform should be based on a general agreement among \r\nall Member States on the substance and process, and \r\nthat this is the most important prerequisite for restoring \r\nlost trust. If such an agreement is to emerge, we need \r\ngenuine political will.\r\nDespite the lack of progress on the main issues, we \r\nstill believe that the process of Security Council reform \r\nshould not be subject to any predetermined or arbitrary \r\ntimetable. Any ill-considered or careless decision would \r\nrun the risk of harming that very delicate process, \r\nwhich is of vital importance and great interest to the \r\nwhole membership of the Organization and will have \r\nfar-reaching impacts for the whole world. We therefore \r\nbelieve that every effort must be made to reach the \r\nbroadest possible agreement among Member States.\r\nWhile text-based negotiations are certainly an \r\nefficient way of proceeding, we need to agree on a text. \r\nI wish to reiterate that Iran considers intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to be the only appropriate and irreplaceable \r\nformat. The intergovernmental negotiations must \r\ncontinue to be Member-State-driven and to function \r\nin a fully comprehensive and transparent manner. My \r\ndelegation welcomes the continued efforts in that regard \r\nand is willing to actively participate in the process.\r\nMs. Chan (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation welcomes the appointment of Ms. Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as the \r\nnew facilitator for the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nWe also express our deep appreciation to Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray of Jamaica for the work he has done.\r\nWe reiterate our commitment to continuing to work \r\nwholeheartedly in this process, which must accord \r\nwith the fundamental principles of the Organization \r\nand which, above all, must strengthen multilateralism. \r\nFor that reason, Costa Rica shares the concerns and \r\nsuggestions set out by the representative of Italy on \r\nbehalf of the Uniting for Consensus group (see A/70/\r\nPV.43). \r\nIn all the intergovernmental negotiation rounds, \r\nCosta Rica has explained why it is firmly opposed to the \r\ncreation of new permanent seats and to any expansion of \r\nthe veto or any other privilege in the Security Council.\r\nFor Costa Rica, reform of the Security Council \r\ncannot be effective, legitimate or democratic if it \r\nconsists simply of expanding the privileges that some \r\nenjoy and adding permanent seats for others. My country \r\nhas explained why it believes that a gradual expansion \r\nof the non-permanent seats, with the possibility that \r\nsome representatives might remain for more than two \r\nconsecutive terms, is the only way for us to have a more \r\nlegitimate and representative body, where the voices \r\nand innovative ideas of Africa, Asia, Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean can be heard. Their readiness to play a \r\n15-34312 19/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nmore active role in the issues currently on the Council’s \r\nprogramme of work will at the same time help to \r\nguarantee improvement of the Council’s accountability. \r\nThat enhanced geographic representativity would also \r\nmake possible to substantially increase the possibility \r\nof election to the Council, benefitting in particular the \r\nsmall countries that are the majority of the Organization.\r\nIt is a question of expanding the real possibilities \r\nof the entire membership, not of limiting them further. \r\nIt is a question of consolidating the United Nations at \r\nthe epicentre of global governance and of ensuring that \r\nthe Security Council complies with its responsibilities \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\ntaking into account considerations of human rights \r\nand improving its work in conflict prevention. Those \r\nreal possibilities would also result in a profound \r\nimprovement in the working methods, which would not \r\nonly facilitate the internal work of the Security Council \r\nbut would also strengthen the relationships between \r\nthe Security Council, the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nWe are well aware that an enlarged Council would \r\nrequire clearer, more predictable, more systematic and \r\nmore transparent procedures. In that regard, Costa \r\nRica has expressed its support for the suggestion \r\nof France aimed at restricting the use of the veto in \r\ncases of mass atrocities, support that dates from our \r\nparticipation in the Small Five group and in the efforts \r\nled by Liechtenstein in the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group in favour of a code of conduct \r\nthat would ban the use of the veto in cases of genocide, \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. We need to \r\nact decisively in such situations. We cannot continue \r\nto allow the opinion of a single permanent member to \r\ncarry more weight than the need to save lives. The veto \r\nbetrays the trust that millions of people place in the \r\nUnited Nations as their ultimate hope.\r\nThe work of the non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council in recent years has been noteworthy. \r\nThey have been innovative, exploratory, proactive \r\nand independent. They have also demonstrated that \r\nthey are able, as non-permanent members, to make \r\nsubstantive contributions to the work of this body. \r\nTheir status as non-permanent members has in no way \r\nprevented them from making important proposals and \r\nsuggesting solutions. For that reason, we should abide \r\nby the provisions of decision 62/557 and negotiate a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council that \r\naddresses the five primary themes and builds on the \r\nproposals of each and every Member State in good faith, \r\nin an open, transparent spirit and without artificial \r\ndeadlines, so that we can achieve the broadest possible \r\npolitical agreement. We share a common goal: to obtain \r\na reform of the Security Council for all, not just a few.\r\nCosta Rica reiterates its full readiness to participate \r\nin any consultations that the presidency considers \r\nnecessary and to contribute in a constructive and \r\nforward-looking spirit to designing a process that will \r\nallow us to move ahead in this defining moment for our \r\nOrganization.\r\nMr. Jinga (Romania): Let me start by expressing \r\nour deep appreciation to the President for his letter \r\nof 23 October, informing Member States about \r\nthe concrete modalities for implementing the core \r\nprovision of decision 69/560, adopted by the General \r\nAssembly on 14 September, to immediately continue \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We support that approach, which is aimed at \r\nsustainably building on the accomplishments of the \r\n11 rounds of intergovernmental negotiations and in \r\nparticular on the positions and proposals advanced by \r\nMember States, as reflected in the text and its annex \r\ncirculated by the former President of the General \r\nAssembly in his letter of 31 July.\r\nRomania was one of the countries that called \r\nfor text-based negotiations. Allow me, therefore, to \r\ntake this opportunity to convey our sincere gratitude \r\nto Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica, for his dedicated, transparent \r\nand accountable work during the previous Assembly \r\nsession. It is now up to Member States to make full \r\nuse of the highly structured document he provided, \r\nwhich was based on the inputs from a large number of \r\ncountries, including my own.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative \r\nof Luxembourg, for assusming the very challenging \r\nmandate of chairing the negotiation process to resolve \r\nthe question of equitable representation on the Security \r\nCouncil, an increase in its membership and other \r\nrelated matters. We are convinced that, in addition \r\nto her well-known personal and diplomatic qualities, \r\nAmbassador Lucas will advance our work by drawing \r\non the experience accumulated during Luxembourg’s \r\nrecent term on the Security Council. I wish to assure \r\nher of my delegation’s full availability to work towards \r\nfruitful and timely concrete results.\r\n20/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nI believe that the matter of concrete results should \r\nbe part of the review and adaptation process of United \r\nNations bodies so that the entire system becomes truly \r\nfit for purpose and committed to action, in accordance \r\nwith the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1).\r\nThere is another point to be made with respect \r\nto the results of our work under this agenda item. Let \r\nme recall that, in its statement of 8 November 2013, \r\nRomania said it was of the view that we should be \r\n“realistically ambitious” (A/68/PV.48, p. 21). That is \r\nwhy, in our view, the five key issues under consideration \r\nshould be approached independently, each at its own \r\npace. We are well aware that others believe that all five \r\naspects are interrelated and should be viewed as a single \r\npackage. But in the absence of substantial progress in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations process, we need \r\nto recognize that pressing topics have emerged outside \r\nthat process and have evolved significantly. I refer here \r\nin particular to the two complementary initiatives on \r\nthe use of the veto.\r\nI am pleased to underline that, in his address in \r\nthe general debate at the Assembly’s current session \r\n(see A/70/PV.16), His Excellency Mr. Klaus Iohannis, \r\nPresident of Romania, reiterated our support for the \r\ninitiative of France and Mexico regarding a collective, \r\nvoluntary agreement among the permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council on the non-use of the veto when \r\naction is needed to prevent or bring to an end situations \r\nof mass atrocities and large-scale war crimes. At the \r\nsame time, Romania is one of the 106 countries that \r\nhave fully endorsed the draft code of conduct regarding \r\nSecurity Council action with respect to genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity or war crimes, submitted \r\non 23 October by the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency group, which is so competently led by \r\nMr. Christian Wenaweser, Permanent Representative \r\nof Liechtenstein.\r\nThe working methods of the Security Council \r\nrepresent an area in which progress has been achieved, \r\nbut there is still room for improvement. That assertion \r\nwas confirmed during the Spanish presidency of the \r\nCouncil. In fact, we would like to congratulate Spain \r\non its excellent organization of the Council’s work \r\nduring the current month, especially in terms of the \r\ninnovative practice of delivering common statements \r\nor presenting briefings by grouping several countries \r\ntogether. The number and quality of the open debates \r\ndemonstrated that the Security Council can indeed \r\nfunction effectively.\r\nI would like to conclude by saying that progress is \r\nwithin our reach, and that we have the duty to advance \r\nSecurity Council reform, including with respect to its \r\nmembership, so that it ref lects the new geopolitical \r\nrealities. Romania stands firmly for the increased \r\nrepresentation of the Group of Eastern European States \r\nand believes that at least one additional non-permanent \r\nseat should be allocated to that Group in the future \r\narchitecture of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Dabbashi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): Allow \r\nme at the outset to extend my wholehearted thanks \r\nto Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, representative of \r\nJamaica, for his efforts during his leadership of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on the expansion and \r\nreform of the Security Council. I would also like to \r\ncongratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, representative \r\nof Luxembourg, on her appointment as the new facilitator \r\nof the negotiations. We hope that real progress will be \r\nachieved in the negotiations and that we will be able to \r\nreach some sort of consensus. \r\nLibya reaffirms its support for and aligns itself \r\nwith the statements made by the representative of Sierra \r\nLeone on behalf of the Group of African States and by \r\nthe representative of Kuwait on behalf of the Group of \r\nArab States (see A/70/PV.43).\r\nAs an African country, Libya affirms that one \r\nof the most important elements of Security Council \r\nreform is to rectify the historical injustice suffered by \r\nthe African continent, which has not been represented \r\nas a permanent member of the Council. We reiterate \r\nthe need to recognize that right as an inalienable, \r\nnon-negotiable right, especially inasmuch as more than \r\ntwo thirds of the situations brought before the Council \r\nconcern the African continent. Such an injustice can \r\nbe eliminated only by giving the African continent two \r\npermanent seats on the Council, with all the prerogatives \r\nof the current permanent members, including the veto. \r\nFurthermore, the African continent should be granted \r\ntwo additional non-permanent seats, as stipulated in the \r\nCommon African Position, the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration. Libya further affirms that any \r\nexpansion of the membership of the Security Council \r\nshould include the Arab countries. They should also be \r\naccorded a permanent seat on the Council, based on the \r\nresolution adopted at the Arab Summit in Sirte in 2010.\r\n15-34312 21/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nReform of the Security Council should not stop at \r\nincreasing the number of seats in the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories, but should also extend to \r\nits working methods and its relationship with other \r\nUnited Nations bodies. In that regard, Libya reiterates \r\nthe need to introduce reforms in the working methods \r\nof the Council to ensure transparency and openness in \r\nits work as well as in its activities and procedures. The \r\nmeetings of the Security Council should be public, and \r\nclosed or in camera consultations should be limited \r\nas soon as possible. Moreover, using the right to the \r\nveto should be limited in cases of war crimes, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and foreign occupation, as a first step \r\ntowards the total abolition of the veto.\r\nLibya also calls for enhancing the participation \r\nof non-member States in the work of the Security \r\nCouncil, in particular by countries directly affected \r\nby the situations currently under its consideration. \r\nWe also reiterate that it is crucial for the Council to \r\nhave established procedures and rules that govern its \r\nrelationship with other United Nations bodies. That \r\nmatter requires review in order to ensure that the \r\nSecurity Council does not encroach on the competence \r\nof other bodies, in particular the General Assembly, \r\nand to facilitate consultations between the Council \r\nand other key United Nations bodies. In the meantime, \r\nthe mandate assigned to each body by the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations should be duly respected. In that \r\nregard, we reaffirm the need for consultative meetings \r\nbetween key bodies and for more public debates and \r\nbriefings, as well as more frequent periodic reports \r\nby the Council to the Assembly. Those reports should \r\nbe inclusive, transparent and duly supported by fact, \r\nevidence and analysis.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Libya’s willingness to be \r\npositively and effectively involved in all efforts to reach \r\na consensus that would eventually reform the Security \r\nCouncil and enable our international Organization to \r\nbe more democratic and transparent.\r\nMr. Bogaert (Belgium) (spoke in French): I \r\nthank the President for organizing this debate on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatter matters related to the Security Council. We must \r\nfollow up on our decision 69/560 of 14 September and \r\nmaintain the momentum of the debate that took place in \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations this year. I take this \r\nopportunity to thank Ambassador Courtenay Rattray \r\nfor his commitment to his work as Chair of that group \r\nand for the significant progress that he was able to \r\nachieve.\r\nBelgium welcomes the appointment of the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxemburg, Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, as Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform. We assure Ambassador \r\nLucas of our full support and cooperation.\r\nOur positions are well reflected in the text attached \r\nto the letter from the President of the General Assembly, \r\ndated 31 July, which should serve as the basis for our \r\nfollow-up work. Our challenge today lies in debating \r\nthe elements of the text in an open and constructive \r\nspirit so that we can further develop practical options \r\nand reach a compromise. We are ready to participate \r\nin consultations in various formats, as needed, under \r\nthe authority of the President and the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. Our work must be \r\nfocused more on substance than on questions of \r\nprocedure.\r\nMr. Zaayman (South Africa): First of all, South \r\nAfrica would like to thank Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray for his robust chairing of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in the previous session, and we join others \r\nin congratulating the new Chair of the negotiating \r\nprocess, Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statement delivered by \r\nthe Ambassador of Sierra Leone on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States, as well as the statement made by the \r\nAmbassador of Saint Lucia on behalf of the L.69 group \r\n(see A/70/PV.43).\r\nSince 2013, South Africa’s President, Mr. Jacob \r\nZuma, has called for the United Nations not to celebrate \r\nits seventieth anniversary without a reformed Security \r\nCouncil. South Africa has been joined in this call by a \r\nvast majority of the States Members of the Organization. \r\nYet, here we are at the seventieth session, having just \r\nlast week celebrated the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nentry into force of the Charter, and we cannot record \r\nany substantive movement on a matter that the vast \r\nmajority of the United Nations membership views as \r\nurgent and critical.\r\nOver the past few years in which we have been \r\nengaged in discussions, it has become clear that nearly \r\nall Member States, including the permanent members \r\nof the Security Council, agree to some extent that the \r\nCouncil must be reformed. In fact, 10 years ago we, as \r\n22/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nMember States, took a unanimous decision at the level \r\nof Heads of State and Government that the Security \r\nCouncil needed urgent reform, and yet we cannot report \r\na single substantive achievement.\r\nSouth Africa is of the view that the main obstacle to \r\nachieving any movement in our ceaseless discussions is \r\nthat the process itself is f lawed. In spite of their name, \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations are not negotiations \r\nbut rather debates comprising endless repetition of \r\ndecades-old positions from groupings and States. That \r\nis why South Africa and so many other Member States \r\nhave called for the start of text-based negotiations. \r\nWe are therefore especially pleased that Ambassador \r\nRattray’s efforts have finally resulted in the Assembly \r\nadopting decision 69/560, endorsing the Chair’s text that \r\nwas circulated on 31 July as the framework document \r\nfor text-based negotiations, which we expect to start in \r\nearnest before the end of the year.\r\nIn his statement in the general debate in September \r\n(see A/70/PV.14), President Zuma urged us to focus \r\nour efforts this year on developing a road map for \r\nthe reform of the Security Council, and that the road \r\nmap must be accompanied with clear, implementable \r\ntime frames. South Africa therefore proposes that \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations adopt a different \r\nformat this year to replace the debate format that has \r\nbecome our routine, and that they vigorously engage on \r\nthe framework document.\r\nWe believe that the process will benefit from block \r\nmeetings. We therefore propose that the Chair schedule \r\na few consecutive days per element to allow for \r\ninteractive exchange and negotiations among Member \r\nStates. In the past few years, we have seen that one-day \r\nmeetings result only in general statements, repeated \r\nad nauseam, thereby threatening to make the process \r\nan endless working group on no reform. South Africa \r\ndoes not believe that adopting such a practical process \r\nwould undermine the principles of all-inclusivity and \r\ntransparency to which we are fully committed. However, \r\nwe should also guard against illogical attempts to delay \r\nthe process through fear-mongering by those Member \r\nStates that falsely argue that text-based negotiations are \r\nexclusive and not transparent.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate its support \r\nfor the President of the General Assembly and the \r\nnewly appointed Chair. We will continue our active \r\nengagement with all Member States to find areas \r\nof agreement and to operationalize the call from our \r\nPresident. We are committed to seeing the historic \r\ninjustice against developing countries, as reflected in \r\nthe composition and working of the Security Council, \r\ncorrected. South Africa believes that the world needs \r\na strong and effective Security Council. We believe in \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations that \r\nenvision a world at peace. However, we are concerned \r\nthat the inherent f laws in the structure and functioning \r\nof the Security Council have debilitated it. That is why \r\nwe remain fully committed to seeing the expansion and \r\nreform of the Security Council within our lifetime.\r\nIn conclusion, South Africa wishes to propose the \r\nfollowing recommendations for consideration by the \r\nnew Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, with \r\nthe aim of guiding text-based negotiations.\r\nFirst, a schedule of meetings per element, outlining \r\nthe negotiating process for the present session, should \r\nbe circulated as soon as possible. That is normal United \r\nNations practice when embarking on a negotiating \r\nprocess, as we saw last year with the schedule that \r\nguided the negotiations for the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1). Secondly, the schedule should make it clear that \r\ninteractive negotiations will be the working method \r\nused to move the process forward, and that such \r\nnegotiations should be steered away from the debate \r\nformat. Thirdly, the negotiations should be focused on \r\nadopting a road map with time frames that will guide \r\nthe process beyond the seventieth session. Fourthly, \r\nthe Chair should explore informal bilateral meetings \r\nbetween divergent groupings to promote the formation \r\nof consensus.\r\nNone of these proposals is new or innovative for \r\nthe United Nations; in fact, we propose them in order \r\nto bring our discussions in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in line with the manner in which the \r\nUnited Nations works to reach agreement on all issues \r\non its agenda.\r\nMr. Hermida Castillo (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We would like to thank the President for \r\nconvening this important meeting on the issues of \r\nequitable representation on the Security Council and \r\nincreasing the number of its members.\r\nWe congratulate Ambassador Sylvie Lucas on \r\nher appointment as Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We are confident that her presidency \r\nwill maintain the negotiating group’s momentum and \r\nimpetus. We are also grateful to Ambassador Courtenay \r\n15-34312 23/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nRattray for his leadership as Chair of the negotiations \r\nduring the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session.\r\nNicaragua aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\nby Ambassador Menissa Rambally, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Lucia, on behalf of the \r\nL.69 group (see A/70/PV.43).\r\nWe hope that this discussion will get to the \r\ntrue centre of our debate, which is how to achieve \r\nthorough reform of the Security Council, particularly \r\nas we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations. We are now 193 Member States; the \r\nOrganization of which we are a part, particularly \r\nthe Security Council, is functioning in a completely \r\ndifferent world, and it must change. The Security \r\nCouncil urgently needs comprehensive reform so that it \r\ncan respond to the realities of the twenty-first century \r\nand expand both membership categories, permanent \r\nand non-permanent. \r\nWe live on a planet whose population has grown \r\nand that is threatened by multiple highly complex \r\nchallenges. Our Organization should respond to the \r\nchallenges of our times with measures and actions that \r\nreflect its highest priority, our peoples’ interests.\r\nAfter the many years devoted to these negotiations, \r\non 31 July we arrived at a consensus agreement on \r\na text and should therefore proceed immediately to \r\nnegotiations, for which we are ready. It is time for \r\nconcrete results. It is essential that we set a timetable \r\nfor our meetings until we reach a final negotiated text \r\nand complete this stage of the reforms. If for some \r\nunfortunate reason the process ends in a stalemate and \r\nwe fail to arrive at a final text, there are other options \r\nthat we can resort to. We hope that will not be the case.\r\nNicaragua is committed to any initiative that can \r\nenable us to recreate, reinvent and re-establish the \r\nUnited Nations, meeting the growing demand for a \r\ndemocratic Organization that will serve in the highest \r\ninterest of soveregin security, justice, and peace in the \r\nworld. Nicaragua will continue to support all efforts to \r\nreform the Security Council, and we are always ready \r\nfor constructive discussion of any subject that can help \r\nto improve the work of our Organization. We reiterate \r\nthe Nicaraguan people’s hope that in this seventieth \r\nanniversary year our commitment will result in a \r\nserious and open process of reflection on the essential \r\ntransformation, reinvention and democratization of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMs. Naeem (Maldives): It is an honour for the \r\nRepublic of Maldives to take part in the Assembly’s \r\ndebate on this important agenda item. We take this \r\nopportunity to thank Mr. Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica \r\nfor his able stewardship of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. My delegation \r\nalso welcomes the appointment of Ms. Sylvie Lucas, \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, as the \r\nnew Chair of the intergovernmental process.\r\nSeventy years ago, 50 countries embarked on a \r\njourney with a promise to change the world for the \r\nbetter. The Organization was born out of the ashes \r\nand bloodshed of a global war, bringing hope and \r\nreassurance for the possibility of achieving progress \r\nand prosperity as well as creating a safe and secure \r\nworld. The task of fulfilling that solemn promise to \r\nmaintain international peace and security was assigned \r\nprimarily to the Security Council. \r\nFor the better part of the 70 years of the United \r\nNations we have dwelled on the issue of reforming the \r\nCouncil. We have spent hours, days, months and years \r\ndeliberating on a possible outcome, one that could \r\nenable the Council to better execute its functions and \r\nuse its powers as enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, and in the spirit of the principle that this organ \r\nis all-inclusive and encompasses the global community. \r\nWhile there is general consensus on the need for reform, \r\nmy delegation remains deeply concerned about the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s persistent inability to ignite this \r\nconversation so that it results in a tangible outcome.\r\nTime and again, we have come before the Assembly \r\ncalling for equitable representation on the Security \r\nCouncil and an increase in its membership. We have \r\ndeliberated on the answers to these questions far too \r\nlong, and it is high time that we moved forward and \r\ncame to grips with the difficult choices to be made. \r\nAs a small State committed to strict adherence to the \r\nrule of law, nationally and internationally, the Maldives \r\nhas always maintained that the Council’s credibility \r\nand legitimacy must be ensured through broader and \r\nmore equitable representation of Member States in \r\nits composition. As it is now, the Security Council \r\nmembership reflects a f lawed representation of the \r\nworld in which its smaller members are left behind.\r\nWe, the small island developing States (SIDS), \r\nhave shown ourselves to be integral members of \r\nthe international community, taking on important \r\nresponsibilities in promoting peace and security on the \r\n24/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\ninternational stage. As a group, we currently provide \r\npeacekeepers to missions around the world in numbers \r\ndisproportionate to our populations. Yet our voice on \r\nthe Council remains vastly underrepresented. Over the \r\npast quarter-century, only six SIDS have served on the \r\nCouncil, out of the 125 members elected during that \r\nperiod. \r\nSIDS continue to face growing security concerns \r\nthat range from transnational organized crime to piracy \r\nand the effects of climate change. The Maldives raised \r\nthose issues at the Security Council’s Arria Formula \r\nmeeting on the security dimensions of climate change in \r\n2013 and in its open debate on the security concerns of \r\nsmall island developing States in July (see S/PV.7499).\r\nWhile we welcome such initiatives as useful, \r\nproductive and essential to recognition of the vast \r\narray of security concerns that Member States face, \r\nwe must ensure that the momentum they generate is \r\nnot lost. We must ensure that concrete steps are taken, \r\nincluding the designation of a SIDS-specific seat. An \r\nexpanded membership must reflect the diverse nature \r\nof the Member States that make up the Organization. It \r\nis precisely because the Security Council lacks diverse \r\nperspectives that it is unable to meet the diverse needs \r\nof the international community.\r\nA diverse membership of this principal organ of \r\nthe United Nations will be achieved only when we give \r\nparamount importance to the principles of equality and \r\nrepresentation. That is especially true when it comes \r\nto Security Council election campaign finances. In \r\nrecent years, the Assembly has seen Council seats \r\nreduced to trophies, bought at exorbitant costs by those \r\nprivileged enough to have the financial ability to do \r\nso. A discussion on membership should appropriately \r\naddress the fact that Member States do not compete on \r\nan equal footing, because when it comes to membership \r\nin that privileged organ, we have been unwillingly \r\nrelegated to a caste and class system that is in desperate \r\nneed of overhaul.\r\nWe stand at a pivotal moment in world affairs. The \r\nchallenges that humankind faces are grave and pressing. \r\nIt is clear that the world today is distinctively different \r\nfrom that inhabited by our predecessors 70 years ago. \r\nIts problems are becoming increasingly interdependent \r\nand interconnected owing to globalization. In \r\ncountering the threats of the twenty-first century, the \r\nrole of the Security Council cannot be overemphasized. \r\nTo achieve the noble principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, which join the members of \r\nthe international community — individually and \r\ncollectively — it is imperative that the Council embody \r\nthe diversity of the global community and become more \r\naccountable, coherent and transparent. The Council’s \r\nfunctioning and working methods must become more \r\nefficient and genuinely represent the will and interests \r\nof the larger United Nations membership. The Maldives \r\ncalls upon the Council’s members to ensure the \r\nrelevance of the Security Council and that its ability \r\nto tackle the world’s most pressing issues is increased.\r\nAt the beginning of the seventieth session, the \r\nAssembly adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). It is an Agenda that \r\ngives hope for the hopeless, an Agenda that has the \r\npotential to truly transform our world. Paramount in \r\nthe Agenda is the call that no one should be left behind. \r\nThroughout the past decades of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform, there has \r\nbeen a general consensus on the need to reform the \r\nCouncil. Paramount in the vast majority of statements \r\nwas the concern that the Council be transformed to \r\nensure greater representation and equality among the \r\nmembership. Most of all, the arguments were premised \r\non the basis that everyone should be truly represented \r\nand that no one should be left behind.\r\nMrs. Nguyen (Viet Nam): I would like to express \r\nour gratitude to the President for having convened this \r\nmeeting on this important agenda item.\r\nI would like to thank Mr. Sam Kutesa, President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, \r\nfor his leadership, which provided much-needed \r\nmomentum for the process of Security Council \r\nreform. My thanks also go to Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for his \r\ntireless efforts and valuable contribution to the work \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. I wish also to \r\nwelcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, as the Chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. We fully believe \r\nthat her experience will allow her to steer the process of \r\nSecurity Council reform to a meaningful advancement.\r\nViet Nam has consistently supported efforts to \r\nreform the Security Council in order to enable it to \r\neffectively perform its functions as the primary organ \r\nfor maintaining international peace and security, \r\nespecially in the context of the unprecedented \r\n15-34312 25/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nchallenges of today. We are of the view that the Council \r\nneeds to be expanded in both membership categories so \r\nas to ensure that it truly represents all United Nations \r\nMembers, as stipulated in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, with equitable regional representation and \r\nadequate representation of developing countries.\r\nAt the same time, we stress the need to further \r\nimprove the Council’s working methods to ensure its \r\nincreased democracy, transparency and effectiveness. \r\nWe look forward to the Council continuing the practice \r\nof holding open debates and public briefings, as well \r\nas strengthening the coordination and collaboration \r\nbetween the Council and the General Assembly.\r\nWith regard to the way forward, we believe that \r\nfurther substantive negotiations should be based \r\non decision 69/560 of 14 September 2015 and on the \r\nmomentum and progress made during the sixty-ninth \r\nsession. We would like to highlight the importance of \r\nthe continued engagement of every Member State to \r\nensure that the intergovernmental negotiations continue \r\nto be conducted in good faith, with mutual respect and \r\nin an open, inclusive and transparent manner.\r\nTo conclude, I assure members of our full support \r\nand readiness to work closely with the President \r\nof the General Assembly and the Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to move the reform \r\nprocess forward.\r\nMr. Dorji (Bhutan): I thank the President for \r\nhaving convened this important meeting.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade on behalf of the L.69 group by Ambassador Menissa \r\nRambally, Permanent Representative of Saint Lucia \r\n(see A/70/PV.43).\r\nWe are confident that we will make meaningful \r\nprogress on the important subject of Security Council \r\nreform under the President’s able leadership and \r\nguidance.\r\nBhutan welcomes the appointment of Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, \r\nas Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations. We \r\nhave no doubt that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwill receive renewed impetus and momentum during \r\nthe seventieth session. We look forward to working \r\nclosely with Ambassador Lucas and assure her of our \r\nfull support and cooperation.\r\nI also wish to place on record our deep appreciation \r\nof the former President, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, \r\nfor his leadership and commitment to advancing the \r\nwork of the intergovernmental negotiations during the \r\nAssembly’s sixty-ninth session. Likewise, my delegation \r\nwould also like to commend the previous Chair of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for his \r\nsteadfast commitment and for the excellent manner in \r\nwhich he steered the deliberations of the eleventh round \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nThe imperative to make the Security Council more \r\nrepresentative, transparent and accountable has been \r\nrecognized since 1993. In 2005, our leaders called for \r\nthe early reform of the Security Council as an essential \r\nelement of our overall effort to reform the United \r\nNations and to make it more broadly representative, \r\nefficient and transparent so as to further enhance its \r\neffectiveness and legitimacy. Bhutan agrees on the \r\nneed to reform the Security Council to make it more \r\nrepresentative, transparent and accountable, in keeping \r\nwith contemporary realities.\r\nThe expansion of the Security Council in both \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership and improvement in its working methods \r\nare necessary to further strengthen and enhance the \r\nlegitimacy and functioning of the Council. For over 20 \r\nyears, beginning with the Open-ended Working Group \r\nand thereafter in the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nwe have engaged extensively on all issues set out in \r\ndecision 62/557. However, the lack of a negotiating text \r\nhas inhibited meaningful progress.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\npresents an opportune occasion to make concrete \r\nprogress on a subject that has remained on our agenda \r\nfor over two decades. We must build on the progress \r\nmade during the sixty-ninth session and make the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations results-oriented by \r\ncommencing text-based negotiations. In that context, \r\ndecision 69/560, which was adopted by consensus, is a \r\nnoteworthy development and an important milestone. \r\nIt also provides a sound basis on which to advance the \r\nwork of the intergovernmental negotiations during the \r\nseventieth session. We therefore look to the leadership \r\nof the President and the Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to take the process forward so that concrete \r\nresults are attained. My delegation looks forward to \r\nengaging constructively with all delegations in that \r\nendeavour.\r\n26/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nMr. Mac-Donald (Suriname): I thank the President \r\nfor convening this important meeting on Security \r\nCouncil reform, which is taking place in the wake of \r\nthe celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations last week. This is a good opportunity \r\nto prepare and engage in practical, meaningful and \r\nresults-oriented negotiations. Allow me to share the \r\nposition of Suriname with regard to Security Council \r\nreform.\r\nFirst, we wish to thank Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for his \r\nhard work and dedication throughout the most recent \r\nround of the intergovernmental negotiations. We also \r\nwelcome the appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, as the new \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform, and wish her success in that significant \r\nresponsibility.\r\nThe Republic of Suriname supports Security \r\nCouncil reform in light of the new realities and changed \r\ncircumstances directing global affairs and inter-State \r\nrelations in today’s world. Suriname wishes to reiterate \r\nits commitment to that reform process, which must be \r\ninclusive, balanced and consensus-based and must take \r\ninto account the interests of developing and developed \r\nStates Members of the United Nations alike in order to \r\nfurther promote, preserve and strengthen international \r\npeace and security.\r\nSuriname is of the view that, while decision 69/560 is \r\na base document, it cannot and should not be considered \r\nto be an exclusive guide to the negotiating process. The \r\nnegotiating process must remain open to additional \r\nperspectives and not be constrained by unrealistic \r\ntimelines for completing its work. Consequently, \r\nwe also welcome the Council’s organization of open \r\ndebates on this subject and engagement in informative \r\ndiscussions that allow the parties involved to be heard \r\nand to contribute. To achieve a more accountable, \r\nrepresentative and transparent Security Council, \r\ncontemporary regional and international realities must \r\nbe reflected in any new structure that we may establish.\r\nSeventy years after the original composition and \r\nstructure of the Security Council were established, it \r\nis obvious that improving its representation and the \r\nworking methods is not only necessary is but essential \r\nto the existence of the Organization and to the belief and \r\ntrust that the world community — made up of States \r\nlarge and small, developed and developing States, \r\ncoastal, island and landlocked States, States from the \r\nNorth and the South — has placed in our Organization. \r\nIt is in that spirit that the Republic of Suriname will \r\nparticipate in the new round of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation welcomes the convening of this meeting. If \r\nanything has emerged clearly from the statements made \r\ntoday, it is Members’ great agreement that there is an \r\nurgent need to adapt the structure of our Organization \r\nso as to allow it to adequately reflect the changed \r\ninternational scene. In that regard, Peru reiterates that \r\nthere is a need to advance towards the goals of achieving \r\na renewed, reformed, expanded, more democratic and \r\nrepresentative Security Council that is also effective \r\nand efficient and whose methods of work are more \r\ntransparent.\r\nMy delegation wishes to acknowledge the efforts and \r\nvaluable work done by the Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica, Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, as facilitator \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform, who carried out his delicate functions \r\nwith transparency and the substantive participation of \r\nthe Member States. I would also like to congratulate \r\nthe Ambassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg on her \r\nappointment to head that important process at this \r\nsession. I take this opportunity to tell her that she can \r\ncount on the support of my delegation.\r\nIn accordance with the content of decision \r\n69/560, my delegation values the work done in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process during the \r\npast session. Nevertheless, we are aware that we \r\nneed a document that covers all the positions of all \r\ndelegations involved, because Security Council reform \r\nwill be feasible only if it enjoys the broadest possible \r\npolitical support of the membership. I reaffirm the full \r\nwillingness of my country to continue to participate \r\nconstructively in the process of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on the question of equitable representation \r\non and increase in the membership of the Security \r\nCouncil and related matters.\r\nI will not expand on Peru’s position on the points \r\ncontained in decision 62/557. I will simply mention that \r\nwe support the inclusion of new members, permanent \r\nand non-permanent alike, in order to promote a just \r\nand equitable regional representation. My delegation \r\nbelieves that such an expansion should be sufficient to \r\n15-34312 27/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nincrease the Council’s representativeness, but not so \r\ngreat as to render it less effective.\r\nWith regard to the issue of the veto, Peru has \r\nconsistently maintained a principled position in favour of \r\nits eventual abolition. Aware of the inherent difficulties \r\nof such a move, my delegation supports a compromise \r\nlimiting the use of the veto and eliminating the \r\npossibility of its use in cases of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity or successive f lagrant violations of human \r\nrights or international humanitarian law. We welcome \r\nthe policy statement issued by France and Mexico in \r\nthat regard, and participated in the drafting of the code \r\nof conduct recently launched by the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group, of which we are \r\nmembers. With regard to working methods, we need \r\npractical reform to increase the Council’s legitimacy \r\nand transparency and the efficiency and effectiveness \r\nof its work.\r\nHaving discussed Security Council reform for \r\nmore than two decades, we can make progress only if \r\nwe show flexibility and willingness to make mutual \r\nconcessions. Reaffirming our national positions does \r\nnothing but postpone a decision that we all consider to \r\nbe of the greatest importance, because if we wish to \r\nreform the Security Council, we must turn that wish \r\ninto concrete commitments.\r\nMr. Espinoza Jara (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation thanks the President for convening \r\nthis important meeting. We stress our commitment to \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nI extend our welcome and recognition to \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas, on her appointment as \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiating process. We \r\noffer her our support. At the same time, we reiterate \r\nour gratitude to the former President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. Sam Kutesa, and Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for their \r\nwork during the sixty-ninth session.\r\n Decision 69/560, adopted by consensus, should \r\nserve as the basis for our work on a subject of the \r\ngreatest importance for the Organization. We must \r\nbe able to make progress towards creating a Security \r\nCouncil that responds to new geopolitical realities and \r\nwhose working methods are guided by transparency, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency. \r\nAs we have stated in the past, my country supports \r\nthe expansion of Security Council membership in the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories alike. In that \r\nrespect, we support the inclusion of Brazil, Germany, \r\nJapan and India. At the same time, we support the \r\nAfrican aspiration, which we believe to be absolutely \r\nindispensable and appropriate.\r\nWith regard to the use of the veto, my country \r\nhas expressed its position in regard to the extension \r\nof that privilege. As a consequence of its position, \r\nChile, alongisde 155 other Member States, supports the \r\ncode of conduct to limit its use, as well as the French-\r\nMexican initiative along those lines.\r\nI shall not elaborate on our national position on \r\nother aspects of this issue, but my delegation wishes to \r\nreiterate its commitment to a constructive and f lexible \r\napproach to Security Council reform. We appeal to all \r\nMember States to demonstrate the same flexibility to \r\nadvance our common aim.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Today \r\nwe are addressing the complex and important issue \r\nof Security Council reform, following 20 years of \r\ndiscussion. In that regard, we commend the efforts made \r\nover the years to facilitate this discussion, and express \r\nour thanks and gratitude to Ambassador Courtenay \r\nRattray, Permanent Representative of Jamaica, for his \r\nleadership during the sixty-ninth session. We welcome \r\nthe appointment of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas of \r\nLuxembourg as the new Chair of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. We also congratulate the newly elected \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council for \r\nthe biennium 2016-2017.\r\nThe State of Kuwait welcomes the Security \r\nCouncil’s adoption this morning of presidential \r\nstatement S/PRST/2015/19, related to the improvement \r\nof the working methods of the Security Council. The \r\nstatement reaffirms the complementarity among the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations. We hope that it \r\nsignals another step towards strengthening reform and \r\nattaining our goals.\r\nOver the years, we have witnessed many \r\ninternational and regional initiatives addressing the \r\nfive elements of reform pursuant to decision 62/557. We \r\nwish to stress once again that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations are the only forum to reach consensus \r\nin regard to the expansion and reform of the Security \r\nCouncil pursuant to that decision, which lays the \r\n28/29 15-34312\r\nA/70/PV.44 30/10/2015\r\nfoundation for the negotiations and their ownership by \r\nthe Member States.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has endorsed the code of \r\nconduct put forward by the Accountability Coherence \r\nand Transparency group in regard to the improvement \r\nof the working methods of the Security Council, \r\nincluding the restriction of the right of veto in cases of \r\ncrimes against humanity. In that regard, we welcome \r\nthe French initiative calling on the five permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council to voluntarily refrain \r\nfrom its use in such instances.\r\nThe position of the State of Kuwait remains \r\nunchanged. We feel that all proposals to reform the \r\nSecurity Council should be aimed at empowering \r\nit to become more representative and to reflect the \r\nnew international reality that has emerged since the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations 70 years ago. This \r\nwill require the political resolve to bring points of view \r\ncloser together in order to overcome differences and \r\nfind common ground regarding the future of the reform \r\nprocess. We are confident that Ambassador Lucas will \r\nhelp us to achieve such consensus through her able \r\nleadership of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nThe State of Kuwait believes that reform should be \r\nholistic; it should be an ongoing process leading to the \r\nevolution of all United Nations organs. It should make \r\nthem more complementary and add greater balance \r\nto the work of the Organization. We must focus on \r\ndeveloping the relationship of the Security Council \r\nwith other United Nations organs. The Security \r\nCouncil should not encroach on the competencies and \r\nmandates of other organs, such as the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and the General Assembly. It should \r\nrestrict its role to discharging its mandate to maintain \r\ninternational peace and security. \r\nWe must pursue our work to improve the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council by ensuring greater \r\ntransparency and clarity and the adoption of permanent \r\nrules of procedure.\r\nAny expansion of the Council’s membership should \r\ngive smaller countries access to membership so that \r\nthey can contribute to its work. We should also take into \r\nconsideration the right of Arab and Muslim countries \r\nto be fairly represented, in line with their number and \r\nimportance and in defence of the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nThe State of Kuwait feels that achieving any \r\nreform will require cool heads and f lexibility. We must \r\nimpose no measure that could undermine the unity and \r\ncredibility of the Organization.\r\nMs. Lucas (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): I \r\nwelcome this opportunity to make a few comments at the \r\nend of this very informative debate. The large number \r\nof Member States and groups whose representatives \r\nhave spoken today demonstrates the importance of \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nI wish first to thank the President of the General \r\nAssembly for having entrusted me with chairing the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform at the seventieth session. I am very honoured \r\nby the confidence that President Lykketoft has placed \r\nin me. I am also mindful of the responsibility that goes \r\nwith this appointment. Members may rest assured that I \r\nwill do my utmost to show myself worthy of it.\r\nSecondly, I wish to pay tribute to my colleague \r\nAmbassador Courtenay Rattray, who preceded me as \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations. I welcome \r\nhis tremendous commitment to the United Nations. \r\nAlongside his team and the support of Member States, \r\nAmbassador Rattray unquestionably succeeded in \r\ngiving new impetus to the reform process. I will do my \r\nbest to continue along the trail blazed at the sixty-ninth \r\nsession and to advance the negotiations on Council \r\nreform.\r\nThirdly, I thank my colleagues for their \r\ncongratulations, expressions of support, words of \r\nencouragement and even their advice for the work \r\nahead. It is my conviction that we will be able to make \r\nprogress in Security Council reform only if Member \r\nStates commit, in good faith, to respecting one another \r\nin an open, inclusive and transparent manner. I am \r\ncommitted to working independently and impartially to \r\npromote an environment conducive to such constructive \r\nand collective engagement.\r\nThe framework for my work is clear, as outlined in the \r\nsubstantive decision 69/560, adopted on 14 September \r\nby the General Assembly. It is through that decision and \r\nothers adopted from 2008 to 2014 — beginning with \r\ndecision 62/557 — that the Assembly has mandated the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. The framework of my \r\nmission is also set by the letter of appointment by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, dated 23 October. \r\nIn the same spirit that President Lykketoft conveyed in \r\nhis letter and in his statement from this rostrum this \r\n15-34312 29/29\r\n30/10/2015 A/70/PV.44\r\nmorning (see A/70/PV.43), I encourage all Member \r\nStates to maintain the momentum generated at the last \r\nsession to advance the reform process on the basis of \r\ndecision 69/650, and in particular the positions and \r\nproposals of Member States as laid out in the decision’s \r\ntext and annex and distributed to the General Assembly \r\nin the President’s letter of 31 July. For the first time, \r\nwe have a text referenced in a decision of the General \r\nAssembly, which will allow Member States to engage \r\nin substantive negotiations on reform. I encourage \r\neveryone to seize this opportunity.\r\nI am mindful that reform of the Security Council is \r\none of the most difficult reforms to make in the context \r\nof the United Nations. The stakes are high, but the \r\ndifficulty of the task must not cause us to shrink from \r\nit. It is in that spirit that I look forward to working with \r\nall during this anniversary session of our Organization. \r\nWith the support of the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the commitment of all stakeholders, I \r\nam convinced that we will be able to continue to move \r\nahead on Security Council reform and contribute to the \r\nstrong United Nations for a better world that our Heads \r\nof State and Government vehemently called for a month \r\nago in this very Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 121.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
