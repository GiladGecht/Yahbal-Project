Members \r\nwill also recall that under this item the Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 70/3 at its 38th plenary meeting, \r\nheld on 23 October 2015.\r\nDuring the debate on this item held on Monday, \r\n12 October, the Assembly had before it identical \r\nletters dated 17 June 2015 from the Secretary-General \r\naddressed to the President of the General Assembly \r\nand the President of the Security Council (A/70/95), \r\ncontaining the report of the High-level Independent \r\nPanel on Peace Operations, and a report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral entitled “The future of United Nations peace \r\noperations: implementation of the recommendations of \r\nthe High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations”, \r\ncirculated in document A/70/357.\r\nFollowing the deliberations on the topic that took \r\nplace on that day, as well as constructive informal \r\nconsultations subsequently held with the membership, \r\nI submitted a draft resolution that is now contained in \r\ndocument A/70/L.6. I would like to thank delegations \r\nfor their fruitful engagement during the consultation \r\nprocess, which resulted in the proposal that is now \r\nbefore the Assembly.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.6, entitled “Strengthening of the \r\nUnited Nations system”. May I take it that the Assembly \r\ndecides to adopt it?\r\nDraft resolution A/70/L.6 was adopted (resolution \r\n70/6).\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 122.\r\nAgenda items 119 and 120\r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nThe President: I would like to begin with a few \r\nremarks on the issue that is the subject of today’s debate.\r\nIn our recent celebrations of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Organization, we reminded \r\nourselves about the values, purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. In order to advance \r\nthose purposes, however, the General Assembly’s \r\nrole, authority, effectiveness and efficiency must be \r\ncontinually reviewed and enhanced.\r\nResolution 69/321, adopted in September, mandated \r\nthat the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe Work of the General Assembly should continue its \r\nwork during the seventieth session. With that in mind, I \r\nrecently reappointed Ambassadors Vladimir Drobnjak \r\nof Croatia and Wilfried Emvula of Namibia to continue \r\ntheir work as Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group. \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.45\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n45th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 3 November 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nI commend their efforts to date, and I call on members \r\nto extend to them their full support and cooperation. \r\nDuring the sixty-ninth session, the Working Group \r\nfocused on four thematic clusters and identified ways to \r\nenhance the Assembly in line with its mandate.\r\nFirst, concerning the role and authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, resolution 69/321 encouraged \r\nthe implementation of resolutions and reaffirmed \r\nthe relationship between the principal organs of the \r\nUnited Nations. I am working to increase cooperation, \r\ncoordination and exchanges of information between the \r\nPresidents of the principal organs and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Indeed, only two weeks ago, I briefed the \r\nSecurity Council during its open debate on working \r\nmethods (see S/PV.7539), an exercise that I feel was \r\nbeneficial to both bodies. As mandated, I will also \r\ncontinue the practice of holding thematic debates, of \r\nwhich there will be three next year, and I will do all I \r\ncan to ensure that they are focused on results.\r\nSecondly, regarding the working methods of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, significant progress has been made \r\nthrough the sharing among the Main Committees \r\nof best practices and lessons learned. Since taking \r\noffice, I have met with the Chairs of each of the six \r\nMain Committees, and so far we have had one meeting \r\nwith the General Committee, in which we discussed \r\nissues of common interest, including streamlining the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s agenda in the light of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \r\nand the need to manage time efficiently in the work \r\nof the Committees. A further meeting will be held in \r\nNovember. I have also met with the coordinators of the \r\nregional groups, and in November I hope to meet with \r\nthem collectively to discuss ongoing business in the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Finally, during this session I will \r\nconvene an informal meeting on enhancing cooperation \r\nbetween the Permanent Missions and the Secretariat.\r\nThe third cluster considered by the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup relates to the selection and appointment of the \r\nnext Secretary-General. Resolution 69/321 provides \r\nclear guidance on the way forward on that crucial issue. \r\nIn that regard, the President of the Security Council and \r\nI will circulate a joint letter to the membership inviting \r\nthe timely presentation of candidates and describing the \r\nentire process. It is also envisaged that the names of \r\nindividuals submitted for consideration as candidates, \r\ntogether with accompanying documents, including \r\ncurricula vitae, will be circulated on an ongoing basis \r\nand that the Assembly will conduct informal dialogues \r\nor meetings with candidates. The resolution also \r\nstresses the importance of ensuring that the position \r\nof Secretary-General is filled by the best possible \r\ncandidate. In my view, the inclusion and consideration \r\nof female candidates will go a long way to securing that \r\noutcome.\r\nThe fourth cluster considered by the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group relates to the running of the Office of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly, a matter that has \r\ntaken on even greater significance given recent events \r\nconnected to the President of the Assembly at its sixty-\r\neighth session. Last year, the Assembly recognized that \r\nthe activities of the President have increased markedly \r\nin recent years, and over the past two months I have \r\nalready seen evidence of that. The primary role of \r\nthe President and his or her Office continues to be to \r\nofficiate at the meetings of the General Assembly, but \r\nin reality, the work is much more extensive and includes \r\nensuring the fulfilment of mandates as laid down in \r\nmultiple Assembly resolutions.\r\nThe presidency is therefore not just a great honour \r\nbut a considerable responsibility, requiring an Office \r\nthat is adequately staffed and run in the most effective \r\nmanner possible, while adhering to the highest standards \r\nof ethics and governance. As members are aware, the \r\nOffice of the President is subject to a series of checks \r\nand balances, including through briefings to Member \r\nStates and audits of the regular budget and of the trust \r\nfund for the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly, as well as through reports submitted in the \r\ncontext of the Assembly revitalization process, and so \r\nforth. As with any institution, however, there is always \r\nscope for improvement, and that, I believe, should be \r\nconsidered in greater detail as a matter of priority by \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group.\r\nI have also been informed that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral intends to establish an internal task force on \r\nthe issue as a whole that could also be of assistance. \r\nConsideration could be given, for example, to matters \r\nof disclosure, financial independence, staffing and \r\nreporting. Engagement with external actors is another \r\nimportant issue, although, given the emphasis on \r\npartnership in the 2030 Agenda, it is perhaps relevant \r\nto the broader Organization as well.\r\nTransparency, however, is also a matter for each \r\nand every President, and from the outset I have taken \r\na number of steps to support that objective, including \r\n15-34703 3/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nby holding regular press briefings and providing \r\ninformation on the staffing of my Office. In addition, on \r\na new page on my website that is entitled “Commitment \r\nto Transparency”, I am today making available an \r\ninformation note on the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly that builds on the President’s \r\nhandbook. \r\nIn order to strengthen confidence in the presidency, \r\nI would also like to outline to members three principles \r\nof conduct that my Office and I will adhere to during \r\nmy presidency.\r\nThe first is integrity and impartiality — representing \r\nthe Assembly in an impartial manner, trying to avoid \r\nconflicts of interest and ensuring gender and geographic \r\nbalance in my Office. The second is transparency and \r\naccountability — providing information about official \r\ntravel, finances and engagements, communicating \r\nopenly with the membership and external audiences and \r\ncomplying with all relevant rules and procedures. And \r\nthe third is professionalism and effectiveness — running \r\nmy Office effectively and using its resources efficiently, \r\nkeeping appropriate records and ensuring a smooth \r\ntransition to the President of the next session, as the \r\nPresident for the sixty-ninth did so effectively.\r\nOn this and on the other three clusters, there is \r\nstill significant scope for action, and I will be giving \r\nclose attention to the views of members on how best to \r\nfurther revitalize the Assembly’s work, including the \r\ncomments I have already received this morning from \r\na number of ambassadors who have themselves been \r\ndiscussing how to improve the ethics and transparency \r\nof the work of the President of the General Assembly \r\nand of the President’s Office.\r\nI now give the f loor to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Today I will be speaking \r\nabout a most serious matter that strikes at the prestige \r\nand reputation of the General Assembly. I have already \r\nexpressed my shock at the very serious allegations that \r\nhave been made against the President of the Assembly \r\nduring its sixty-eighth session. I have also declared \r\nunequivocally that we will not tolerate corruption at \r\nthe United Nations or in its name. The Assembly must \r\nnow draw the larger lessons from the incident and act \r\nwith resolve. In that effort, we can build on a tradition \r\nof responding to problems with systemic solutions.\r\nAs members are aware, the election of the President \r\nof the General Assembly used to be held on the same \r\nday that the new session opened. Then, in 2001, the \r\n11 September terrorist attacks prevented the Assembly \r\nfrom convening and electing a President. As a result, \r\nthere was a leadership vacuum and a crisis. At the time, \r\nI was the Chef de Cabinet of the incoming President. We \r\nrealized that we had to prevent any such disruption in \r\nthe future, so we ended the 56-year tradition of holding \r\nthe election on the first day of the session. Starting \r\nin 2002, the President of the General Assembly was \r\nelected three months in advance. That protects against \r\na leadership vacuum and provides transition time for \r\nthe new President to prepare. I also take note of the \r\nfact that the non-permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council will now \r\nbe elected six months in advance of their terms.\r\nIt is critical to learn from unfortunate incidents \r\nor terrible events. Member States must now improve \r\nthe functioning of the Office of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in order to make its organization \r\nmore robust, and that includes strengthening the budget \r\nthat supports the President’s activities. We need greater \r\ntransparency and accountability. That is essential. \r\nI welcome the work undertaken in that regard by the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia, \r\nwho served as Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly during the previous session, and I welcome \r\ntheir reappointment by you, Mr. President, for this \r\nsession. I will support them in every way possible.\r\nThroughout my tenure, I have made it clear that \r\nthe United Nations should embody the highest level \r\nof integrity and ethical standards. That is why I have \r\ntaken note of the intention of the United States Attorney \r\nto get to the bottom of the very serious allegations \r\nregarding the propriety of the conduct of the President \r\nof the sixty-eighth session. As members are aware, I \r\nhave taken a number of specific steps to address, head \r\non, the important issues that have been raised. I have \r\nrequested an internal audit by the Office of Internal \r\nOversight Services (OIOS) of the interactions between \r\nthe United Nations and the entities mentioned in the \r\ncriminal complaint. I have also asked OIOS to audit any \r\nfunds received from those entities, as well as any funds \r\ndisbursed to them by the United Nations. I have also \r\nrequested that OIOS determine whether other matters \r\nthat might arise during the course of the audit merit \r\nfurther audit.\r\n4/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nDecisions on the functioning of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly are the purview of \r\nthe Assembly. But it is incumbent on all of us to help \r\nget this right. That is why I have established an internal \r\ntask force, chaired by the Chef de Cabinet, to review \r\nthe arrangements for the financing and staffing of the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly. The \r\ntask force will recommend ways to promote enhanced \r\ntransparency and accountability. I have also asked the \r\nheads of the United Nations entities mentioned in the \r\ncriminal complaint that may have engaged with the \r\nentities involved in the complaint to advise me about \r\nwhat they are doing to look into the matter.\r\nMy Office, and I personally, will continue to \r\nbe in close contact with the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly in order to ensure the \r\ncomplementarity and coherence of those efforts. All of \r\nus have a responsibility to work together to make sure \r\nthat this Organization and its officials comply fully \r\nwith all relevant rules and regulations, and to carry out \r\nour duties in full transparency before the eyes of the \r\nworld.\r\nI welcome the General Assembly’s initiatives \r\naimed at involving more stakeholders in its discussions \r\non issues of critical importance to the international \r\ncommunity. Informal interactive thematic debates now \r\ninclude members of civil society and others, whose \r\nvoices and efforts can add great value to our work. \r\nIn the Assembly’s most recent resolution on \r\nrevitalizing its work (resolution 69/321), Member States \r\nset out important measures concerning the process for \r\nselecting and appointing the next Secretary-General, my \r\nsuccessor. They include a joint letter from the Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly and the Security Council to \r\nstart the process of soliciting candidates, circulation of \r\nthe names of individuals that have been submitted for \r\nconsideration, and the convening by the Assembly of \r\ninformal dialogues or meetings with those candidates. \r\nThose advances demonstrate the wide-ranging scope of \r\nthe agenda item on that topic, which encompasses the \r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly, its working \r\nmethods and the institutional memory of the Office of \r\nthe President of the Assembly.\r\nI look forward to working with members and \r\nsupporting their efforts to revitalize the General \r\nAssembly so that it can achieve our shared objectives.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement.\r\nMr. Bessedik (Algeria): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM).\r\nI would like to express our thanks to you, \r\nMr. President, for having convened this plenary meeting, \r\nwhich is devoted specifically to engaging in a debate \r\nto consider jointly agenda item 119, “Implementation \r\nof the resolutions of the United Nations”, and agenda \r\nitem 120, “Revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly”.\r\nAt the outset, the Non-Aligned Movement would \r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Wilfried Emvula, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Namibia, and Mr. Vladimir \r\nDrobnjak, Permanent Representative of Croatia, on \r\ntheir reappointment as Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group of the Revitalization of the Work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to wish them every success in \r\ndischarging their duties.\r\nFirst, NAM stresses the importance of the \r\nfull implementation of resolution 69/321, entitled \r\n“Revitalization of the work of the General Assembly”, \r\nwhich the General Assembly adopted by consensus on \r\n11 September, and recalls its f lexible approach, which \r\nled to that consensus adoption. It was also agreed to \r\ncontinue examining the four clusters, among them the \r\nselection and appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nand other executive heads during the Assembly’s \r\ncurrent, seventieth session, as well as strengthening \r\nthe institutional memory of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nSecondly, NAM highlights the importance of giving \r\npriority this year to the issue of the appointment of the \r\nfuture Secretary-General, whose election is planned \r\nto take place in 2016. In the light of paragraph 44 of \r\nresolution 69/321, and in full compliance with Article 97 \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, NAM calls on the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to play a proactive \r\nrole in the run-up to the selection and appointment of \r\nthe next Secretary-General, in order to enhance the \r\ntransparency and credibility of the selection process \r\nand to make the latter more interactive and inclusive \r\nat all stages.\r\nIn this regard, NAM believes that the current \r\npractice of the appointment of the Secretary-General \r\nis informal and f lexible, having evolved over time. \r\nTherefore, resolution 11 (I) was completed and amended \r\nby the provisions of resolutions 51/241, 60/286, 64/301, \r\n66/294, 68/307 and 69/321, in order to make this process \r\n15-34703 5/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nmore transparent and democratic and inclusive of all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations.\r\nWhile strongly expressing the importance of the \r\nfact that the relevant provisions of the aforementioned \r\nresolutions should be fully applied to the forthcoming \r\nprocess of the selection and appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General, the Non-Aligned Movement has \r\nnoticed with regret that most of these provisions have \r\nnot yet been implemented, as reflected in the updated \r\ninventory chart of General Assembly resolutions on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nIn this regard, NAM stresses the importance of the \r\nfull implementation of the aforementioned resolutions \r\nto the immediately upcoming process of the selection \r\nand appointment of the Secretary-General, in strict \r\ncompliance with rule 141 of the rules of procedure \r\nof the General Assembly, which provides for a vote \r\nby secret ballot in a private meeting of the General \r\nAssembly upon the relevant recommendation of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn the light of the foregoing, NAM considers \r\nthat at this time of increased global challenges, from \r\nclimate change to armed conflict, terrorism and \r\npandemics, the urgent need for effective leadership and \r\ninternational cooperation is greater than ever. In this \r\nregard, we stress, on the one hand, the need to promote \r\nmore interaction between the Security Council and \r\nthe General Assembly, in particular through a more \r\nanalytical report of the Security Council, and, on the \r\nother, the importance of improving the current process \r\nof the appointment of the Secretary-General. The aim \r\nis to make the way in which the Secretary-General \r\nis chosen more transparent, credible and inclusive of \r\nall Member States by making full use of the power of \r\nappointment enshrined in the Charter.\r\nTo remedy this, NAM calls on the Security Council \r\nto recommend more than one candidate endorsed by a \r\nMember State for appointment as Secretary-General \r\nfor consideration by the General Assembly. The best-\r\nqualified candidates will possess and display, inter alia, \r\na commitment to the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter, extensive leadership and administrative and \r\ndiplomatic experience.\r\nTo start the process in an open and transparent \r\nmanner, NAM requests the Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council to circulate a joint \r\nletter addressed to all Member States calling on all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to submit formal \r\ncandidatures for the post of Secretary-General. Such a \r\nletter should include a description of the entire process \r\nand specify a deadline for the candidatures.\r\nNAM also calls on potential endorsed candidates to \r\nsend a letter to the President of the General Assembly \r\nand the President of the Security Council notifying \r\nthem of their formal candidatures for the post of \r\nSecretary-General, unlike under the current practice, \r\nwhich is limited to informing formally only the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nFurthermore, NAM calls on the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to hold timely hearings or meetings \r\nof the Assembly for an exchange of views and a dialogue \r\nor informal dialogues with candidates presented by a \r\nMember State. The summary of the consultations would \r\nthen be forwarded to Member States and the Security \r\nCouncil.\r\nIn the course of the identification and appointment \r\nof the best candidates for the post of Secretary-General, \r\nwho should include women, due regard will continue \r\nto be given to regional rotation and will also be given \r\nto gender equality, as stipulated in paragraph 59 of \r\nresolution 51/241.\r\nWe also believe, as suggested in the Joint Inspection \r\nUnit report for 2011, that prevailing practices in the \r\nelection of executive heads in other United Nations \r\nsystem bodies could also be suitable for the appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General. Therefore, we recommend \r\nconsidering existing practices.\r\nMoreover, NAM would like to emphasize the issue \r\nof promises made by candidates in exchange for the \r\nsupport of the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, which is described in the aforementioned \r\nreport of the Joint Inspection Unit. We consider that \r\nthere is no position reserved for any Member State. \r\nIt is therefore important that candidates not be under \r\npressure, either before or after being appointed, to \r\ngive posts in the Secretariat to people of any particular \r\nnationality in return for political support, since this \r\nis clearly contrary to the spirit of the United Nations \r\nCharter.\r\nThirdly, NAM believes that there is a need to balance \r\nthe part allocated in the Ad Hoc Working Group to the \r\ngeneral debate and the part devoted to negotiations \r\non the resolution. Delegations must also have enough \r\ntime to revert to their capitals on those matters. In that \r\ncontext, we kindly request the co-Chairs to present a \r\n6/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\ndraft work programme of the Ad-Hoc Working Group \r\non the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly, which should be balanced and concise and \r\nhave a clear time frame.\r\nOnce again, the Non-Aligned Movement supports \r\nan effective, genuine strengthening of the institutional \r\nmemory of the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly and of the role and authority of the General \r\nAssembly, including in questions related to international \r\npeace and security, bearing in mind the Assembly’s \r\nintergovernmental, inclusive and democratic character, \r\nwhich have immensely contributed to the promotion of \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and its goals. At the same time, NAM reiterates \r\nthe validity and relevance of its principled position on \r\nworking methods. In that context, NAM emphasizes \r\nthe need to continue examining pending issues related \r\nto the four clusters.\r\nTo conclude, the Non-Aligned Movement underlines \r\nthe importance of the political will of Member States \r\nand of the role to be played by the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during this session in the process of \r\nselecting and appointing the next Secretary-General, a \r\nprocess that must be conducted in accordance with the \r\naforementioned resolutions.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms its commitment \r\nto contributing effectively and constructively to the \r\nupcoming meeting of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly and \r\nto the discussions on each of the clusters. We are ready \r\nto cooperate and engage in fruitful and constructive \r\ndiscussions with all the delegations in a comprehensive, \r\nthorough and transparent manner.\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the observer of \r\nthe European Union.\r\nMr. Vrailas (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries Turkey, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization \r\nand Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine, the Republic \r\nof Moldova and Armenia, align themselves with this \r\nstatement.\r\nI thank you, Mr. President, for convening today’s \r\nplenary meeting and for your engagement in the \r\nrevitalization process of the General Assembly. I would \r\nlike to congratulate the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Croatia and Namibia on their reappointment as \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly. \r\nThat reappointment is a testament to their excellent \r\nwork in the Ad Hoc Working Group during previous \r\nsession of the General Assembly and the significant \r\nprogress achieved in relation to resolution 69/321 on the \r\ntopic. We wish the co-Chairs success also during this \r\nsession and express our support for the upcoming work.\r\nThe European Union and its member States are \r\nstrong proponents of effective multilateralism, with the \r\nUnited Nations at its core. Our top priorities remain the \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations, based on effective \r\nand sustainable funding, in line with real capacity to \r\npay, and increasing the efficiency of its functioning \r\nwhere there is scope to do more. In that context, \r\nwe remain committed to the revitalization process \r\nand to supporting efforts aimed at strengthening \r\nthe role and authority of the General Assembly in \r\nline with the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nrelevant resolutions. Indeed, we wish that the General \r\nAssembly — as the only intergovernmental body with \r\nuniversal membership and a broad mandate with far-\r\nreaching responsibilities — would take up the challenge \r\nof reconciling legitimacy and efficiency in the context \r\nof the emerging global challenges.\r\nAt the same time, we wish to reiterate the \r\nimportance of taking concrete steps, at all levels, \r\naimed at spending more judiciously, delivering in new \r\nways and ensuring that the Organization lives within \r\nthe agreed budget levels. That applies to all United \r\nNations activities, from peacekeeping to construction \r\nand the regular budget. For a more effective delivery of \r\nmandates and the sustainable use of resources to occur, \r\nan unceasing effort to find new, creative working \r\nmethods is essential. We believe that only when the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes relevant action on issues of \r\ncommon concern to the international community and \r\nproduces results can revitalization be ensured. By \r\ndoing so, it lives up to its role as one of the principal \r\norgans of the United Nations.\r\nThe EU and its member States welcome the adoption \r\nof resolution 69/321, which contains significant new \r\nideas. The f lexibility of all States Members of the United \r\nNations engaged in the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nmade its adoption possible. It can be seen as a milestone \r\nin enhancing the transparency and inclusivity of the \r\nselection process for the next Secretary-General. We \r\n15-34703 7/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\ncall on the President to ensure the necessary follow-up, \r\nincluding the sending of the joint letter envisaged in \r\nresolution 69/321. The holding of informal dialogues or \r\nmeetings with candidates for the position of Secretary-\r\nGeneral is particularly noteworthy in that regard.\r\nThe General Assembly revitalization process has \r\nalso led to other positive developments, for example, \r\nthe thematic debates, which facilitate more in-depth \r\ndiscussions on current issues of critical importance to \r\nthe international community. The EU and its member \r\nStates especially value the interactive character of the \r\nthematic debates, which enable the General Assembly \r\nto be more closely engaged with other stakeholders, \r\ninternational and regional organizations and groups \r\noutside the United Nations system. We look forward to \r\nthe continuation of that practice and invite the President \r\nto consult with Member States on the possibilities, \r\nwhere appropriate and in the spirit of partnerships, of \r\nengaging a broad range of stakeholders and achieving \r\nresult-oriented outcomes in such debates. We also \r\nrecognize the importance of interaction between \r\nthe General Assembly and international or regional \r\nforums and organizations dealing with global matters \r\nof concern to the international community, and the \r\nbenefits that such interaction yields.\r\nWe appreciate the Secretary-General’s continued \r\npractice of holding periodic informal briefings on his \r\npriorities, travels and most recent activities, including \r\nhis participation in international meetings and events \r\norganized outside the United Nations, and encourage \r\nhim to continue that practice.\r\nAs to the relationship of the General Assembly to \r\nthe other principal organs of the United Nations, the EU \r\nand its member States believe that the strengthening of \r\ntransparency and cooperation remains an important \r\ngoal. The General Assembly should benefit from \r\ninformation about the meetings between the Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly, the Security Council, the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and the Chairs of \r\nsubsidiary bodies.\r\nOn the issue of working methods, we wish to \r\nrecall the need to consider and take steps aimed at \r\nrationalizing the agenda of the General Assembly and \r\nof the Economic and Social Council with a view to \r\neliminating duplication and overlap, and promoting \r\ncomplementarity in the consideration and negotiation \r\nof similar and related issues. In that context, it is \r\nimportant to recall resolution 68/1. We believe that the \r\nbiennialization and triennialization of items should \r\nbe further examined, as well as their clustering or \r\nelimination, including through the introduction of a \r\nsunset clause, with the clear consent of the sponsoring \r\nState or States. In that regard, the leadership shown by \r\nthe Chairs and the Bureaus of the Main Committees is \r\nof great importance. Let me highlight, in particular, the \r\nefforts of the Chairs of the Main Committees during \r\nthe sixty-ninth session to improve working methods \r\nin the Committees. Their joint letter, dated 13 April, \r\nwith specific proposals to streamline working methods \r\nproved most helpful in making further progress in \r\nthat area. We look forward to continuing that very \r\nconstructive work with the Main Committee Chairs \r\nduring the seventieth session, and look forward to their \r\nbriefings to the Ad Hoc Working Group in the spring.\r\nWe note with appreciation the constructive debate \r\non the working methods of the Second Committee, \r\nwhich was held on 9 October. We are encouraged by \r\nthe general recognition of the need for the Second \r\nCommittee to respond comprehensively and coherently \r\nto the proposals in the recently adopted 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). We fully \r\nsupport the ongoing efforts of the Chairs to collect \r\nideas and propose ways forward in that endeavour, in \r\nline with resolution 69/321 on the revitalization of the \r\nwork of the Assembly. We welcome similar initiatives \r\nby the Chair of the Third Committee during the present \r\nsession.\r\nAlthough each Main Committee has its own \r\nauthority over its rules of procedure, we believe that \r\nstreamlining and standardizing the rules would lead to \r\nmore efficient work on the part of the Committees. We \r\nwould like to stress as well the importance of making \r\nfull use of e-services provided by the Secretariat. The \r\nwidespread use by Main Committees and Member States \r\nalike of such e-services, including the PaperSmart \r\nportal, has had a positive impact on the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during its main session, while it has \r\nalso saved considerable amount of resources, energy \r\nand paper. We have to continue to work in that direction.\r\nWe look forward to the active roles of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, the President — including in his role as Chair \r\nof the General Committee — and the Chairs of the \r\nMain Committees, in consultation with Member States, \r\nto enhance the coordination of the scheduling of high-\r\nlevel meetings with a view to optimizing their number \r\nand distribution throughout the year, while bearing in \r\nmind the need to preserve the integrity of the general \r\n8/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\ndebate. We believe that the General Committee could \r\nplay a useful role in that process.\r\nWe would also like to stress the importance of \r\nimplementing all General Assembly resolutions, \r\nincluding those on the revitalization of the Assembly’s \r\nwork. The implementation of the resolutions will have \r\na positive impact on the Assembly’s authority and \r\nefficiency. The revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly is clearly interlinked with overall United \r\nNations reform.\r\nWith regard to the functions of the Office of the \r\nPresident, efforts to strengthen the institutional memory \r\nof the Office remain of great importance and benefit \r\nus all. To that end, efforts to encourage cooperation \r\nbetween incumbent and incoming Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly could prove most useful. Given \r\nthe evolving work load of the General Assembly, the \r\nEU and its member States are firmly committed to \r\nidentifying and implementing possible rationalization \r\nand improvements in the definition of the President’s \r\nrole. That would be in support of the work of the General \r\nAssembly and the effective and efficient functioning of \r\nthe Office. Strengthening the role and authority of the \r\nPresident also requires practical steps to strengthen the \r\nOffice’s resources and ability to effectively accomplish \r\nits tasks. In that regard, we would welcome innovative \r\nideas that correspond with the need for budgetary \r\nrestraint and transparency.\r\nResolution 69/321 encourages the President of \r\nthe General Assembly to continue the practice of \r\nperiodically briefing Member States on his or her \r\nactivities, including official travel. We see that as both \r\na valuable source of information and an important \r\nact of transparency for the Member States. The \r\nPresident of the General Assembly presides over the \r\nprincipal United Nations organ, with its universal \r\nmembership, and his Office must embody transparency \r\nand accountability for all stakeholders, especially as \r\nthe President represents all Member States at official \r\nmeetings and during official travel.\r\nFinally, let me emphasize the important role played \r\nby the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of General Assembly. I would like to \r\nassure everyone that the EU and its member States \r\nwill continue to engage constructively in the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group’s proceedings. We look forward to \r\nreceiving a work plan soon.\r\nMr. Raja Zaib Shah (Malaysia): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), comprising 10 member States, \r\nnamely, Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, \r\nthe Lao People’s Democratic Republic, Myanmar, the \r\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and my own \r\ncountry, Malaysia. ASEAN also aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nAt the outset, let me congratulate Mr. Vladimir \r\nDrobnjak, Permanent Representative of Croatia, and \r\nMr. Wilfried Emvula, Permanent Representative of \r\nNamibia, on their re-appointment as the Co-Chairs of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly during the seventieth \r\nsession. We would also like to express our appreciation \r\nfor their stewardship in facilitating the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group’s work during the previous session. \r\nASEAN is pleased with the progress made during \r\ntheir co-chairmanship, particularly resolution 69/321, \r\nwhich was adopted on 11 September. We also commend \r\nMr. Sam Kutesa, the President of the General Assembly \r\nat its sixty-ninth session, for his commitment to moving \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nforward.\r\nThe recent seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations provided an opportunity to further reinvigorate \r\nand revitalize the United Nations. A revitalized United \r\nNations will make the Organization more effective, \r\ntransparent and inclusive. The United Nations will \r\nthen be better equipped to respond to the needs of \r\nMember States. We should all work together to ensure \r\nthat the General Assembly plays its role as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative organ of \r\nthe United Nations. I will highlight several keys issues \r\nthat deserve special consideration during the seventieth \r\nsession.\r\nFirst, we welcome the reaffirmation in resolution \r\n69/321 of the importance and benefits of continuing the \r\ninteraction between the United Nations and regional \r\nforums, particularly the political declaration on \r\nstrengthening cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional and subregional organizations of 5 May \r\n2015 (resolution 69/277).\r\nASEAN has made great strides as a regional \r\norganization. This year is particularly significant, as the \r\nASEAN Economic Community will be established at \r\nthe end of the year. ASEAN looks forward to enhancing \r\n15-34703 9/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nits interaction and cooperation with the United Nations \r\naimed at addressing issues of common interest and \r\nconcern. We hope that follow-up on concrete measures \r\nor actions will continue in that important direction set \r\nby the General Assembly.\r\nSecondly, ASEAN welcomes the General \r\nAssembly’s adoption of resolution 68/307 in 2014, \r\non the conduct of the elections of the non-permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council and the members of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council about six months \r\nbefore the newly elected members assume their \r\nresponsibilities. We support the current practice of the \r\nSecurity Council of inviting its newly elected members \r\nto observe some of its meetings and activities prior \r\nto assuming their responsibilities. That will certainly \r\nprovide appropriate opportunities for newly elected \r\nnon-permanent members to prepare for their tenure in \r\nthe Council.\r\nThirdly, with regard to the selection and appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General, ASEAN believes that the \r\nagreement reached in resolution 69/321 should be \r\nimplemented faithfully in order to ensure a transparent \r\nand inclusive selection process. In that regard, we join \r\nother Member States in requesting the Presidents of both \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council to start \r\nthe process of soliciting candidates for the position of \r\nSecretary-General through a joint letter addressed to all \r\nMember States, requesting that candidates be presented \r\nin a timely manner. As we work towards the election \r\nand appointment of the next Secretary-General in 2016, \r\nASEAN looks forward to receiving a clear description \r\nof the entire process, including a clear time line for \r\nthe selection process and the schedule for informal \r\ndialogues between Member States and the candidates. \r\nWe request that the Presidents of the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council jointly circulate the names of \r\nindividuals who have been nominated as candidates for \r\nSecretary-General on an ongoing basis to all Member \r\nStates.\r\nTo further enhance accountability and transparency, \r\nwe also encourage open Security Council meetings, \r\nincluding Arria-formula meetings, with the short-\r\nlisted candidates, and regular briefings by the Security \r\nCouncil on the progress of the nomination process.\r\nLast but not least, we look forward to strengthening \r\nthe institutional memory of the Office of the President. \r\nWe are pleased that resolution 69/321 has emphasized \r\nthe need to ensure, from within agreed resources, \r\nthat the Office of the President is allocated dedicated \r\nSecretariat staff. The staff will be responsible for \r\ncoordinating the transition between Presidents, \r\nmanaging interaction between the President and the \r\nSecretary-General and preserving the institutional \r\nmemory in a timely manner.\r\nWe also welcome Member States that have seconded \r\nmembers of their staffs from their respective Missions \r\nto assist and strengthen the Office of the President in \r\ndischarging its mandates. ASEAN joins other Member \r\nStates in encouraging frequent engagement between \r\nthe President-elect of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Council of Presidents. The Presidents-elect may \r\nbenefit from the experiences of former Presidents in \r\nterms of best practices and lessons learned. In further \r\nstrengthening institutional memory, we encourage the \r\noutgoing Presidents of the General Assembly to transmit \r\na summary of their work during their terms of office \r\nto their successors. We also encourage the holding of \r\na structured and constructive exchange of experiences \r\nbetween them during the three-month transition period.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate the continuing \r\ncommitment of ASEAN to engage constructively with \r\nother Member States in the deliberations of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly during the Assembly’s seventieth \r\nsession. We are confident that, with the political will of \r\nall Member States, we will be able to reach consensus \r\nand a concrete outcome.\r\nMr. Jürgenson (Estonia): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency (ACT) group. The cross-regional ACT \r\ngroup is comprised of 25 small and mid-size countries \r\nworking together to improve the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe ACT group would like commend all Member \r\nStates for their commitment to the negotiation process \r\nand for the spirit of compromise and f lexibility exhibited \r\nduring the negotiations on resolution 69/321, and we \r\nwish, in that connection, to thank the Co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group, the Ambassadors of Croatia \r\nand Namibia, for their excellent work and dedication. \r\nWe wish to stress the importance of the effective and \r\nsubstantiated communication between the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council and the wider \r\nmembership during the negotiations on the resolution on \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\nThe ACT group is pleased with the outcome and the \r\n10/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nconsensual adoption of that resolution on 11 September, \r\nwhich has also established a structured process for the \r\nselection of the next Secretary-General.\r\nOf course, as mentioned by the previous President of \r\nthe General Assembly at the adoption of the resolution, \r\nimplementation is the key. Over the years, we have \r\nseen many resolutions passed and not implemented on \r\nthe issue of selecting the next Secretary-General. We \r\nmust change that. As a first step, a joint letter by the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil should be sent to all Member States calling for \r\nnominations. We would hope to receive such a letter in \r\nthe coming weeks in order to kick off the whole process \r\nbefore the end of the year. The President of the General \r\nAssembly has received a very strong mandate from \r\nresolution 69/321 on revitalization, and the elements of \r\nthe letter are also outlined therein. Now we are looking \r\nforward to the Council’s doing its part. In that regard, \r\nwe were pleased to hear about the informal discussion \r\nthat the Security Council had under the New Zealand \r\npresidency in July and are hopeful that preparations to \r\nsend out the letter are being made as we speak.\r\nWithin a much wider picture, our main concern \r\nshould be to ensure that the best candidates will come \r\nforward and be considered based on specific selection \r\ncriteria. In 1945-1946, the Preparatory Commission \r\nof the United Nations said that the Secretary-General, \r\nmore than anyone else, would stand for the United \r\nNations as a whole. We would like to ensure that all \r\nMembers States, as well as the wider international \r\ncommunity, have the possibility to hear the candidates’ \r\nvisions and to interact with them.\r\nIn addition, we believe that, after 70 years, the time \r\nhas come to be even more innovative. We are, therefore, \r\nof the opinion that, in making the final decision, due \r\nregard should be given to equal and fair geographical \r\nand gender balance. We are also looking forward to a \r\nthorough discussion during this session on the duration \r\nof the term in office of the Secretary-General, including \r\nthe option of a single, non-renewable term.\r\nMr. Yadav (India): I am honoured to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of India at today’s debate. \r\nI thank you, Mr. President, for convening this important \r\nmeeting.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to align myself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Wilfred Emvula, \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Namibia, and \r\nMr. Vladimir Drobnjak, Permanent Representative \r\nof Croatia, upon their reappointments as co-Chairs of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe Work of the General Assembly and to wish them \r\nsuccess in that endeavour. They also deserve our deep \r\nappreciation for the good work they did during the \r\nprevious session.\r\nAs we mark the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations, the issue of United Nations reform, including \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly and the \r\nreform of the Security Council, has assumed particular \r\nsignificance. We must heed the call for United Nations \r\nreform made by a large number of world leaders during \r\nthe recent general debate held at the beginning of the \r\nseventieth session of the Assembly.\r\nIn his statement at the Security Council’s annual \r\ndebate on working methods on 20 October, the President \r\nof the General Assembly said,\r\n“[i]t would be remiss of me to conclude without \r\naddressing the issue of Security Council \r\nreform — arguably one of the most discussed issues \r\nwithin the United Nations and beyond, over many \r\ndecades. As was underlined by a large number of \r\nworld leaders during this session’s general debate, \r\nthis topic is of central importance to a large majority \r\nof the membership.” (S/PV.7539, p. 5)\r\nWe note with regret that an ineffective Security \r\nCouncil has led to huge human costs in terms of wars and \r\nconflicts, which the international community cannot \r\njustify. The figures speak for themselves, especially the \r\nhuge figure of more than 60 million people affected by \r\nthe malfunctioning of the Security Council.\r\nIt is our firm believe that urgent and comprehensive \r\nreform of the United Nations is imperative in order \r\nto make the Organization reflective of the current \r\ngeopolitical realities and enhance its capability to meet \r\nthe increasingly complex and pressing transnational \r\nchallenges of our time. While we are happy that \r\nresolution 69/321, adopted on 11 September, has \r\nhighlighted some of the important steps required on \r\nour collective journey towards a revitalized General \r\nAssembly, we firmly believe that we still have a great \r\ndistance to cover. Meanwhile, the full implementation \r\nof that resolution is imperative.\r\n15-34703 11/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nWe believe that the General Assembly will not be \r\nempowered merely by strengthening procedures and \r\nstreamlining working methods. It will be empowered \r\nonly if its position as the chief deliberative, policy-\r\nmaking and representative organ of the United Nations \r\nunder Article 10 of the Charter is respected in letter and \r\nspirit. That requires that the General Assembly should \r\ntake the lead in setting the global agenda and restoring \r\nthe centrality of the United Nations in formulating \r\nmultilateral approaches to resolving transnational \r\nissues. In particular, revitalization must restore the \r\nprimacy of the United Nations in development matters. \r\nWe would like to make three points in that regard.\r\nFirst of all, it is critical that the issue of preventing \r\nencroachment upon the mandate of the General \r\nAssembly and making the Security Council more \r\nrespectful of the mandates of other bodies be addressed. \r\nThe encroachment by the Security Council on issues \r\nthat traditionally fall within the purview of the General \r\nAssembly are of particular concern. Moreover, the \r\nholding of thematic debates on issues that frequently \r\nfall within the purview of the General Assembly or the \r\nEconomic and Social Council also remains an area of \r\nconcern. The balance between the principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations, as stipulated by the Charter, must \r\nbe respected and maintained.\r\nSecondly, one of the more important issues before \r\nthe United Nations in the coming year will be the \r\nselection of the next Secretary-General. There is a \r\ngreat deal of debate on the prerogatives of the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly in that matter. At \r\nthe heart of the debate, however, is the question of the \r\nprerogatives of the P-5, as opposed to those of the rest \r\nof the membership of the United Nations. And that, to a \r\nlarge extent, is determined by something as seemingly \r\ninnocuous as the working methods of the Council.\r\nMy delegation has advocated strongly for the \r\nSecurity Council to recommend the names of two \r\nor more candidates to the General Assembly. While \r\nthe pronouncements of the General Assembly do not \r\nspecifically provide for that, there is, in our view, \r\nno legal impediment that would prevent the Security \r\nCouncil from taking such an action. The General \r\nAssembly, as the voice of the international community, \r\nmust be given greater say in the selection of the next \r\nSecretary-General. That is in the interests of the United \r\nNations system in general and of the Assembly’s \r\nprerogatives in particular. It is in our collective interest \r\nto select the most appropriate next chief executive of the \r\nUnited Nations as we begin to implement the ambitious \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1).\r\nThirdly, the Assembly and the other entities that \r\nform part of the United Nations system must reflect \r\nbest practices in their day-to-day functioning. That \r\nwill require a review of the way in which the Assembly \r\nconducts its business and the adoption of best practices. \r\nIn our view, the primacy of the Assembly f lows from \r\nthe universality of its membership as well as from the \r\ndiligent application of the principle of sovereign equality \r\nof all its members. Ownership of the Assembly’s \r\ndecisions and activities is, therefore, reflected in the \r\ndegree of participation by Member States. Member \r\nStates must, therefore, have the political will to take \r\nconcrete measures to reinforce the role and authority of \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, let me re-emphasize the need to \r\ndiscuss substantive measures that would strengthen \r\nthe role of the General Assembly as the chief \r\ndeliberative, policy-making and representative body \r\nof the international community. You can count on my \r\ndelegation’s constructive support and participation in \r\nthose efforts.\r\nMrs. Dieguez Lao (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nCuban delegation aligns itself with the comprehensive \r\nstatement made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, but \r\nI would like nonetheless to make a few remarks in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nFirst of all, we are grateful to the co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly for drafting their report \r\non the issues and the efforts undertaken to further the \r\nprocess of revitalization during the previous session of \r\nthe Assembly. We would also like to congratulate them \r\non their re-election to lead the Working Group.\r\nThere will never be a genuine reform of the \r\nUnited Nations without far-reaching revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly, and that, in our view, \r\nwill be possible only by bolstering the democratic, \r\nparticipatory character of the body through the full \r\nexercise by the 193 Member States of the powers \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nAssembly must recover and strengthen its deliberative, \r\nnormative and policy-making functions in accordance \r\nwith the powers stipulated by the Charter and in the \r\nmultiple resolutions and declarations agreed on in the \r\n12/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nUnited Nations. In order to guarantee the ongoing trust \r\nof the international community in the United Nations, \r\nas well as its legitimacy, the Organization must truly \r\nrespond to the collective interests of its Member States.\r\nThe main problem of the Organization lies in the \r\nfailure to implement many of the numerous resolutions \r\nof the General Assembly, which constitute an important \r\nnormative corpus that remains largely inert, because the \r\nimplementation of resolutions depends on the political \r\nwill of States with the political, military and economic \r\npower to apply them. The resolutions on the topic that \r\nconcerns us today have unfortunately not escaped that \r\nfate. Their level of implementation remains extremely \r\nlimited.\r\nCuba stresses the need for an appropriate balance \r\namong the major organs of the United Nations, in \r\naccordance with the Charter, and calls for a halt to \r\nthe growing and dangerous tendency of the Security \r\nCouncil to encroach on the Assembly’s sphere of action.\r\nRevitalizing the General Assembly cannot be \r\na bureaucratic process. In the wise words of Father \r\nMiguel d’Escoto, of the sister Republic of Nicaragua, \r\nin his farewell address as President of the General \r\nAssembly at the sixty-third session, “Revitalization is \r\na political rather than a technical issue” (A/63/PV.105, \r\np. 29). We hope that the revitalization process will \r\nenhance the interaction between the Secretariat and the \r\nGeneral Assembly so that the Secretariat can respond \r\nin a more effective manner to the mandates that are \r\ndetermined by the Member States. We also hope that \r\nthe process will strengthen the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly and wish to convey our full \r\nsupport to the President.\r\nMr. Abdrakhmanov (Kazakhstan), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAs part of its work, the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly \r\nmust exercise strict control over the implementation of \r\nthe relevant General Assembly resolutions, continually \r\noverseeing and updating the inventory chart of all the \r\nresolutions relating to the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly. We now have a large body of \r\nlegislation on the revitalization of this principal organ. \r\nWe recognize the advances that have been made, but \r\nmuch remains to be done.\r\nWe will not have an Organization that responds \r\neffectively to the system of contemporary international \r\nrelations unless we reform the Security Council and \r\nmake the General Assembly the centre of multilateral \r\ndiscussion and work.\r\nCuba wishes to reaffirm its commitment to \r\ncontinuing to participate constructively in the \r\nupcoming meetings of the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Munir (Pakistan): Pakistan aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of Algeria \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe congratulate Ambassadors Emvula and Drobnjak \r\non their reappointment as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly. It is a fitting recognition of their \r\nsuccess during the sixty-ninth session.\r\nThe General Assembly has been working diligently \r\non its mandated tasks. It played a landmark and seminal \r\nrole in the design and development of the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. The implementation of the new \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will put the \r\nGeneral Assembly at the centre of decision-making. \r\nThe roles and mandates of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council have been defined clearly by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Encroachment by any \r\nCharter body on the role of another must be avoided. The \r\nCharter provides the General Assembly with enormous \r\nspace for playing its role. The General Assembly should \r\nuse that space optimally. It has a leadership role to play, \r\nfor example, on peacekeeping, by using the full potential \r\nof its Special Committee on Peacekeeping Operations. \r\nIn addition, it has undertaken ground-breaking work in \r\na number of fields from human rights to development \r\nto international law. Resorting to the Uniting for Peace \r\nmechanism, when necessary, enables the Assembly to \r\nleave an indelible imprint on international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nTwo-way communication between the Council \r\nand the Assembly should not remain merely symbolic \r\nand cosmetic but should become substantive and \r\nconsequential. We have proposed a number of small \r\nsteps that could improve that communication. First, the \r\nPresidents of the Assembly and the Council should add \r\nsubstance to their largely pro forma monthly meetings \r\nby discussing collaboration between them, based on the \r\nagendas of the two bodies. Secondly, the annual reports \r\nof the Council to the Assembly should be made more \r\nanalytical, and the General Assembly’s views should \r\nfeed back into the Council’s work. Last year’s letter from \r\n15-34703 13/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nthe President of the Assembly in response to the report \r\nof the Security Council was a beginning. Thirdly there \r\nshould be better scrutiny and evaluation of the Council’s \r\nwork by the general membership. Finally, the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group, the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nfor Security Council reform and the General Assembly \r\nitself should work with the Security Council and its \r\nInformal Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions to refine and improve the Security \r\nCouncil’s working methods to make it more accountable \r\nand transparent for the general membership.\r\nSecurity Council reform provides us with an \r\nopportunity to enhance the relationship between the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. The \r\nSecurity Council undertakes the responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security \r\non behalf of all the Member States, not in lieu of \r\nthem. Therefore, the Council should be accountable \r\nto the wider membership of the General Assembly. \r\nThe only way in which this accountability can \r\nbe strengthened is through increasing the elected \r\nmembership of the Council. Moreover, in that process, \r\nthe General Assembly also needs to focus on increasing \r\nrepresentation as well as on other equally important \r\nmatters such as the veto, the size and working methods \r\nof the Council, and regional representation. Adding \r\nmore permanent members to the Council will only \r\nundermine its representative character and the principle \r\nof accountability through democracy. We should pursue \r\nthe principle of the greatest good of the greatest number \r\nby ensuring that all Member States — small, medium \r\nand large — are adequately and equitably represented \r\nin the reformed Council on the basis of fixed terms and \r\nrotation. Council reform should reflect the aspirations \r\nand interests of all, not the ambitions of a few.\r\nThe process of selecting and appointing the \r\nnew Secretary General has assumed even greater \r\nsignificance this year. Transparency, inclusivity and \r\nproviding a say to the General Assembly would enhance \r\nthe legitimacy of the process as well as the office. We \r\nmade good progress on the issue last year and need to \r\ncontinue on that path.\r\nThe implementation of resolutions is critical. And \r\nthis requires the political will of Member States as well \r\nas adequate resources. The selective implementation of \r\nresolutions, by design or by default, must be avoided. As \r\nspelled out in resolution 69/231, Member States should \r\nbe briefed by the Secretary-General about the status of \r\nimplementation. Updating the inventory of resolutions \r\nshould be further improved by including information \r\non reasons for non-implementation and delays.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly and the \r\nfaithful implementation of its decisions would act as \r\na force multiplier in empowering the United Nations \r\nto resolve difficult issues of peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. We look forward to a \r\nsubstantive and constructive debate on the subject and \r\nassure the co-Chairs of our cooperation and support.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): I would 1ike to start \r\nby thanking the President for his initiative on the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\nBoth in his acceptance statement (see A/69/PV.94) and \r\nin his statement at the opening of the seventieth session \r\nof the Assembly (see A/70/PV.1), he emphasized the \r\nimportance of revitalizing the General Assembly. Japan \r\ncompletely shares his views.\r\nSeventy years have now elapsed since the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations. In addition to \r\nSecurity Council reform, to which Japan attaches high \r\npriority, revitalizing the General Assembly is a crucial \r\ncomponent of the reform agenda. We must make steady \r\nprogress towards achievable and realistic results on this \r\nitem.\r\nWe learned with deep shock and sadness the news \r\nthat the President of the General Assembly at the sixty-\r\neighth session was arrested in early October by United \r\nStates authorities. According to media reports, Mr. Ashe \r\ntook payments from a developer based in Macau using \r\nhis official position. These unprecedented and serious \r\nallegations have severely damaged the prestige and \r\nreputation of the United Nations worldwide. I say it with \r\nregret because Mr. Ashe was a very active president. He \r\nmade efforts to advance such issues as climate change \r\nand sustainable development.\r\nAs the President stated at the press conference on \r\n6 October, corruption has no place at the United Nations \r\nor anywhere else. I am very encouraged that he, as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and coming from \r\nDenmark, which is consistently ranked as the most \r\ntransparent country in the world, is fully committed \r\nto restoring the integrity and credibility of the United \r\nNations. Before coming here today, I wanted to ask \r\nhim to share with us some of the measures that may be \r\nconsidered on this matter. I was therefore very pleased \r\nand encouraged to hear that he has already taken \r\nconcrete steps on the code of conduct for the President.\r\n14/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nOn 8 October, Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nreiterated a similar message on corruption and \r\nrequested that the Office of Internal Oversight Services \r\n(OIOS) undertake an investigation. We welcome his \r\nquick action and hope that the OIOS report will be \r\nissued at the earliest possible date. I also wish to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for the very strong message he \r\ndelivered this morning on this matter. Based on the \r\nPresident’s proposals and on input from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, I would like the Working Group, in coming \r\nsessions, to consider how the Office of the President of \r\nthe General Assembly is run.\r\nThis case reminded us that the f low of money from \r\nand into the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly is not fully transparent. In particular, we \r\nhave no information about how voluntary contributions \r\nfrom Member States and private sources are used. The \r\ntransparency of the money f low should be one of the \r\npoints considered by the Working Group.\r\nWith regard to the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly, Japan welcomes the adoption \r\nof resolution 69/321, which was the fruit of long and \r\ndifficult negotiations. I would like to express my sincere \r\ngratitude to the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup during the previous session — the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Croatia and Namibia — for their \r\nchairmanship. We welcome their reappointment as \r\nco-Chairs of the Working Group for the current session \r\nand are looking forward to closely collaborating with \r\nthem again.\r\nWe achieved a lot in the previous session and, at \r\nthis juncture, can concentrate on steadily implementing \r\nthis cornerstone resolution and addressing the issues \r\nthat were postponed to the current session. With regard \r\nto the selection of the Secretary-General, the resolution \r\nrequests the Presidents of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council to circulate a joint letter containing a \r\ndescription of the entire process and inviting candidates \r\nto be presented in a timely manner. We hope that the \r\nletter will be issued as soon as possible.\r\nAt the previous session, the idea of changing the \r\ncurrent method of selecting the Secretary-General \r\nby encouraging the Security Council to recommend \r\nmore than one candidate to the General Assembly was \r\nproposed and intensely debated. From the viewpoint \r\nof transparency, we believe that the most important \r\npoint is to ensure the accountability of the Security \r\nCouncil in its choice of a candidate. We have to choose \r\nas Secretary-General the best candidate, the one who \r\nmeets the highest standards of efficiency, competence \r\nand integrity. It is desirable that we have as wide a \r\nrange of candidates as possible, including women. In \r\nthis regard, Japan supports paragraph 38 of resolution \r\n69/321, which invites Member States to consider \r\npresenting women as candidates for the position of \r\nSecretary-General.\r\nIn October, Japan was elected to the Security \r\nCouncil as a non-permanent member, supported by an \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States. I thank them \r\nonce again for their support. Since being elected, we \r\nhave two and half months before we join the Council \r\non 1 January. Although it will be the eleventh time that \r\nJapan has the honour to serve on the Council and, for \r\nmyself, the second time, I feel that two and a half months \r\nis a very short time in which to prepare for Council \r\nmembership. I believe that the decision contained in \r\nresolution 68/307 to move the dates for electing new \r\nmembers of the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council to June will achieve the intended goal \r\nof giving new members more time to prepare for their \r\nmembership.\r\nThis year the General Assembly has 173 agenda \r\nitems to consider. I think it is clear that streamlining \r\nthe agenda has become an urgent issue. In order to \r\navoid duplication, some agenda items — of the Second \r\nCommittee, for example — could be reviewed and \r\nintegrated in the light of the holistic nature of the new \r\n2030 Sustainable Development Agenda (resolution \r\n70/1). Japan has already submitted such a proposal to \r\nthe bureau of the Second Committee. Furthermore, \r\nenhancing discipline and fairness in the management \r\nof this body remains an important topic for discussion. \r\nIn this context, I have one point to make: I believe that \r\nwhen the representative of a member State delivers a \r\nstatement on behalf of a group, the representatives of \r\nmember States belonging to that group and wishing \r\nto speak in their national capacity should do so, in \r\nprinciple, after all others with national statements \r\nwhose countries are not associated with a group have \r\nspoken.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by reaffirming \r\nthat Japan stands ready to support the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and contribute in a constructive \r\nmanner to the discussions on the revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly, with a view to further \r\nenhancing the effectiveness and transparency of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\n15-34703 15/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nMr. Percaya (Indonesia): My delegation joins \r\nothers in thanking the President of the General \r\nAssembly for convening today’s important joint \r\ndebate and in congratulating Ambassador Drobnjak of \r\nCroatia and Ambassador Emvula of Namibia for their \r\nreappointment as Co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup for the seventieth session.\r\nIndonesia associates itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representatives of Algeria and Malaysia \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations, respectively.\r\nThere has been progress on numerous fronts \r\nsince a dedicated agenda item on the revitalization of \r\nthe work of the General Assembly was first included \r\nin the agenda, which was at the forty-sixth session \r\nof the Assembly, in 1991. Deliberations on this issue \r\nhave led to the introduction of a number of practices \r\nin the Assembly aimed at enhancing the Assembly’s \r\neffectiveness in performing its role and in fulfilling its \r\nmandate.\r\nThe streamlining and reorganization of the \r\nAssembly’s agenda under thematic headings has \r\ngiven it greater focus. Improved working methods, the \r\nearlier election of the non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council and the members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council and the strengthening of the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly are among \r\nthe deliberations’ outcomes that have enabled the \r\nAssembly to achieve higher prominence. The practice \r\nof convening the members of the General Assembly for \r\nhigh-level debates on crucial global peace, security and \r\ndevelopment challenges have demonstrated how the \r\nAssembly can cultivate greater common understanding \r\non shared challenges and how Member States can \r\ndeploy their collective wisdom and experience for the \r\ngreater good of humankind. That has enhanced the \r\nAssembly’s relevance.\r\nThe latest resolution on revitalizing the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, resolution 69/321, has once again \r\ntaken the work of revitalizing the work of the Assembly \r\nto a higher level. It further paves the way for a closer \r\ncollaboration between the Assembly and the Council, in \r\nparticular on the selection and appointment of the next \r\nSecretary-General. My delegation, however, strongly \r\nfeels that more needs to be done to enable the Assembly \r\nto fulfil its role and responsibility, as envisaged under \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIn that context, my delegation would like to suggest \r\nthe following additional points by way of strengthening \r\nour common endeavour of makinge the Assembly more \r\nrobust. First, the full implementation of resolution 69/321 \r\nmust be ensured, with sharper focus on the selection \r\nand appointment process of the next Secretary-General. \r\nCollaboration between the Assembly and the Council \r\nneeds to be further strengthened in dealing with that \r\nissue and to be expanded to other relevant areas in a \r\nmore meaningful way, according to the respective \r\nareas of competence of those two principal organs of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nSecondly, the upcoming deliberations should focus \r\nmore intently on strengthening consultations between \r\nthe Assembly and the regional organizations on issues \r\nof common interest, including in the fields of peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and development. The Charter \r\nrightly recognizes the role of the regional organizations. \r\nThey can provide useful regional perspectives, wisdom \r\nand insights, as well as contribute positively to the work \r\nof the Assembly and of the United Nations as a whole. \r\nA more effective mechanism for consultations between \r\nthe Assembly and the regional organizations needs to \r\nbe further explored.\r\nThirdly, the role of the General Assembly in the area \r\nof international peace and security should be reinforced \r\nin keeping with its functions and competence. It should \r\ntake the lead in addressing issues of conflict prevention, \r\nadvancing the peaceful settlement of disputes and \r\nsearching for political solutions to conflicts, including \r\nby improving peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. We also believe that, having made a \r\ncommendable beginning, the Assembly can do much \r\nmore in such areas as terrorism by non-State actors, \r\nhuman displacement, intercultural dialogue, promoting \r\ncoexistence between peoples and advancing democratic \r\ntraditions and practices.\r\nIndonesia, for its part, will continue to suggest and \r\nsupport practical ways of revitalizing the Assembly \r\nso that, as the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative United Nations organ, it can better meet \r\nthe expectations of the global citizenry today.\r\nMr. Lasso Mendoza (Ecuador) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): The delegation of Ecuador would like to \r\nbegin by expressing its gratitude to the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Croatia and Namibia, Ambassadors \r\nEmvula and Drobnjak, respectively, and to their \r\nteams for the very wise, efficient and patient manner \r\n16/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nin which they have been leading the work of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly. We would also like to \r\ncongratulate the President on his decision to reappoint \r\nAmbassadors Emvula and Drobnjak as co-Chairs of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe Work of the General Assembly. That will ensure \r\nthe continuity of our discussions and debates from the \r\nprevious session.\r\nUndoubtedly, with the adoption by consensus \r\nof resolution 69/321 in September, we have been \r\nable to make significant progress with respect to the \r\nrevitalization of the work of General Assembly. We have \r\nonce again acknowledged the work of the permanent \r\nmissions in the context of the effectiveness of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and we have revisited the question \r\nof holding an informal meeting of the Assembly to \r\nanalyse ways of improving the coordination between \r\nthose missions and the Secretariat. We are convinced \r\nthat in the coming months, we will be able to hold that \r\nimportant meeting.\r\nWe have also opened a channel for the Secretariat \r\nto familiarize itself with the obstacles that States \r\nencounter when implementing resolutions involving \r\nthe Secretariat. We have encouraged the Chairs and \r\nBureau members of the Main Committees to improve \r\ntheir consultations with member States with the aim \r\nof improving their work and have also stressed the \r\nimportance of respecting the predetermined date for \r\nthe opening of the annual general debate, in accordance \r\nwith the norms that the Assembly itself has established. \r\nWe have also requested a report from the Secretary-\r\nGeneral regarding the gender distribution and the \r\nregional backgrounds of the executive heads and the \r\nmembers of the Senior Management Group of the \r\nOrganization. This is a subject of particular importance \r\nfor my delegation, and we are waiting for the report to be \r\nissued and intend to study it with a view to submitting \r\nspecific proposals.\r\nCertainly, the question that has raised the most \r\ninterest, for obvious reasons, concerns the selection \r\nand appointment of the next Secretary-General. In \r\nthe aforementioned resolution, resolution 69/321, we \r\nreaffirmed the necessity of the full application of rule \r\n141 of the rules of procedure of the General Assembly \r\nwhen appointing the Secretary-General, as this will \r\nenable us to avoid any kind of automaticity when the \r\nGeneral Assembly exercises its exclusive prerogative, \r\npursuant to the Charter, of appointing the chief \r\nadministrative officer of the Secretariat. We have also \r\nintroduced components favouring transparency in the \r\nselection and appointment process of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. They include coordination between the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil at the time that the list of candidates is presented \r\nand keeping Member States informed of who is on that \r\nlist. Moreover, informal meetings have been planned \r\nbetween the General Assembly and these candidates.\r\nMy delegation wishes to draw attention to \r\nparagraph 38 of resolution 69/321, which invites \r\nMember States to consider presenting women as \r\ncandidates for the position of Secretary-General. Given \r\nthat a number of countries have or have had women \r\nas their Heads of State or Government, it is high time \r\nfor the United Nations to join them by appointing a \r\nwomen to the post of Secretary-General. The important \r\nmeasures involving transparency must be accompanied \r\nby others aimed at reaffirming the active role that \r\nthe General Assembly must play in the process of \r\nthe selection and appointment of the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral, in accordance with Article 97 of the Charter. \r\nIt is particularly important for my delegation, therefore, \r\nthat pursuant to paragraph 44 of resolution 69/321, \r\nwe continue during the current session to discuss \r\nand decide on several issues including, for example, \r\nthe optimal number of candidates that the General \r\nAssembly should submit to the Security Council or the \r\nduration of Secretary-General’s term.\r\nOf course, we are committed to discussing and \r\nexchanging views on those questions, with a view \r\nto determining ways of democratizing the process \r\nof selecting and appointing the Secretary-General, \r\nincluding the next Secretary-General of the United \r\nNations, who will preferably be a woman. The aim of \r\nour delegation, while serving on the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly, has been and still is to reaffirm the rights and \r\nprerogatives of the General Assembly, in accordance \r\nwith the relevant provisions of the Charter, it being the \r\nuniversal and most representative organ of the United \r\nNations, on which all Members States are represented \r\non an equal footing. We will maintain that position, \r\nbearing in mind that we have a long road ahead of us \r\nbefore we attain the objectives outlined. Our delegation \r\nstands ready to continue to provide its support to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Zhao Yong (China) (spoke in Chinese): This \r\nyear marks the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\n15-34703 17/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nNations. For the past 70 years, the United Nations has \r\nconsistently made efforts to maintain international \r\npeace and security, to advance world development \r\nand prosperity, and to promote coordination and \r\ncooperation among all countries. For the past 70 years, \r\nthe United Nations has witnessed the exploratory and \r\npractical efforts of Member States to safeguard peace, \r\nbuild a homeland and seek cooperation. At this new \r\nhistoric starting point, we should further reflect on \r\nhow the United Nations can play a bigger role in the \r\nadvancement of humankind in the twenty-first century, \r\nso that the United Nations can better serve the people \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe General Assembly comprises 193 Member \r\nStates and is the most universal and representative \r\nCharter organ of the United Nations. It is also the main \r\norgan for deliberating policy. The seventieth session \r\nof the General Assembly is a session at which we can \r\nbuild on the past and prepare for the future. It is of great \r\nsignificance. It represents an important opportunity \r\nfor the United Nations to reposition itself and make \r\na fresh start. Member countries should work together \r\nto revitalize the General Assembly by injecting a new \r\ndynamism into its proceedings during this session, \r\nwith a view to further promoting and improving United \r\nNations efficiency and effectiveness. In that regard, I \r\nwish to emphasize the following.\r\nFirst, we should comprehensively implement the \r\noutcomes of the United Nations summits with a view \r\nto promoting progress in all areas of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The United Nations has held a \r\nseries of summits in the areas of development, of peace \r\nand security and of women. All the summits have \r\nachieved positive outcomes. This session of the General \r\nAssembly should focus on the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1) and push the General Assembly to a higher level \r\nof achievement.\r\nSecondly, we should fully discharge the General \r\nAssembly function of policy deliberation and continue \r\nto improve the work of the General Assembly. The \r\nCharter of the United Nations provides that the \r\nGeneral Assembly may discuss any questions or any \r\nmatters within the scope of the Charter and make \r\nrecommendations. The General Assembly should, \r\npursuant to the provisions of the Charter, improve its \r\ndivision of labour and coordination with the Security \r\nCouncil and the Economic and Social Council, with \r\neach continuing to maximize its own advantages in their \r\nrespective fields, while at the same time strengthening \r\ncoordination and cooperation to form a synergy.\r\nThe revitalization of the General Assembly is \r\nin the common interest of all Member States and an \r\neffort that China staunchly supports. China has taken \r\nnote of the efforts by the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\non the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly to strengthen the role and the authority of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and improve its working methods. \r\nChina welcomes the reappointment of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Croatia and Namibia to co-chair \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group. We hope that, within the \r\nframework of the Working Group, all parties will follow \r\nthe principles of democratic consultation and gradually \r\nprogress from easier issues to more difficult ones, \r\nso as to steadily push forward the implementation of \r\nresolution 69/321. China will work with other countries \r\nin joint efforts to push for positive progress on the \r\nimportant question of the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMs. Sison (United States of America): The United \r\nStates would like to thank the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly, the Permanent Representative \r\nof Croatia, Ambassador Vladimir Drobnjak, and the \r\nPermanent Representative of Namibia, Ambassador \r\nWilfried Emvula. Their significant contributions \r\nto the General Assembly’s revitalization and their \r\neven-handed management of the Working Group’s \r\nnegotiations over the past year allowed Member States \r\nto reach consensus on a resolution with wide-ranging \r\npositive implications for the Assembly’s work. We are \r\nvery pleased that they are returning to the helm this \r\nyear.\r\nDuring the sixty-ninth session, the Working Group \r\ndiscussed many issues of paramount importance to the \r\nefficacy of the General Assembly with the process for \r\nselecting the Secretary-General, a clear priority for \r\nmany Member States. The United States welcomed the \r\nopportunity to work constructively with other members \r\ntowards increasing engagement and communication on \r\nthe process. In the past year, we achieved consensus \r\non resolution 69/321. That consensus will serve as a \r\nstrong basis for revitalization and includes significant, \r\nconcrete outcomes, particularly on the selection \r\nprocess.\r\nThe selection of a new Secretary-General is always \r\nan exciting time for the Organization. In our view, \r\n18/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nresolution 69/321 reflects the efforts of Member States \r\nto work together constructively to address the selection \r\nprocess, consistent with the clear and straightforward \r\ndirective set forth in Article 97 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. We look forward to carefully \r\nconsidering all candidates over the coming months.\r\nMoving forward, the United States believes we \r\nmust refocus our efforts to increase the Assembly’s \r\nefficiency, effectiveness and transparency. We must \r\nstreamline and prioritize the agenda with an eye to \r\nremoving outdated topics to allow more time to address \r\nthe pressing issues most in need of our attention.\r\nWe should also look to improve the practices \r\nand working methods of the Main Committees. \r\nThese should be among the Working Group’s highest \r\npriorities — tangible aspects of revitalization that will \r\nresult in real improvements for the work of the General \r\nAssembly. We recognize that attention is also being \r\ngiven to other aspects of the Organization’s work, such \r\nas the working methods of the Security Council. These \r\nare important topics, but we do not believe that they \r\nshould be the primary focus of the Working Group’s \r\nefforts, particularly the working methods and other \r\nissues within the Council’s remit. The Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations makes clear the coequal relationship \r\nbetween the two organs, which should be respected.\r\nThe United States is fully committed to multilateral \r\nengagement and a strong United Nations system. We \r\nlook forward to working with all Members as we \r\ncontinue to consider the best options for revitalizing \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We welcome the convening of today’s meeting \r\nof the General Assembly on revitalizing its work. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia on \r\ntheir reappointment to the posts of co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group. We noted their work in those \r\npositions during the sixty-ninth session.\r\nWe support realistic initiatives aimed at increasing \r\nthe effectiveness of the work of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich to a large extent can be achieved by improving \r\nthe working methods of the General Assembly \r\nand by reorganizing its agenda, which is currently \r\noverburdened. We believe it is necessary to continue to \r\nbiennialize and triennialize some agenda items and to \r\ndelete those that are no longer relevant.\r\nWe support the proposal to move the high-level \r\nweek of the general debate, because the Heads of State \r\nand Government and the Ministers for Foreign Affairs \r\nwho are present in New York already have a busy diary \r\nof bilateral events. During that period we should limit \r\nthe number of high-level events, and the rest should \r\nbe spread evenly over the whole period of the General \r\nAssembly session. In that regard, we welcome the plan \r\nof the President of the General Assembly to hold several \r\nhigh-level thematic debates on important agenda items \r\nnext May. Of course, any reform initiative must be \r\nbased on strict respect for the relevant prerogatives of \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations, as set out in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe election of the new Secretary-General is \r\napproaching, and we hope that it will be conducted in \r\nstrict compliance with the provisions of the Charter, \r\naccording to which the Secretary-General is appointed \r\nby the General Assembly on the recommendation of \r\nthe Security Council. It remains to be seen how the \r\nplatform of the General Assembly will be used during \r\nthe election campaign by the candidates for the post \r\nof Secretary-General. We believe that the process \r\nshould not eclipse the substantive work of the General \r\nAssembly. The best format for interaction between \r\ncandidates and Member States is still through regional \r\ngroupings.\r\nAnd there is another aspect. We all recall that in \r\none of the resolutions of the General Assembly there is \r\na request that the Security Council should submit the \r\nname of only one candidate to the General Assembly. \r\nHowever, Russia does not exclude the possibility that the \r\nCouncil may recommend more than one such candidate. \r\nSuch a variant should not present any difficulties for \r\nthe work that the members of the Security Council must \r\nundertake.\r\nIn discussing issues that concern the revitalization \r\nof the General Assembly, we have heard the Security \r\nCouncil criticized for allegedly encroaching on the \r\nprerogatives of other United Nations organs. We \r\nshare that concern. Our colleagues in the Security \r\nCouncil well know that we show restraint with respect \r\nto initiatives that draw the Security Council into \r\naddressing issues of a general nature. We believe that \r\nthe Council should restrict itself to the country-based \r\nissues and areas in which it can and must take practical \r\ndecisions. In fact, we have just prevented attempts \r\nwithin the Security Council to discuss one of the \r\nsustainable development agenda issues, as we believe \r\n15-34703 19/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nthat to do so would be a clear example of encroaching \r\non the mandates of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the General Assembly. We believe that in such \r\ncases the President of the General Assembly should \r\nexercise the prerogatives of that body.\r\nWe note that the Security Council often holds open \r\ndebates that are of interest to many Member States and \r\nthat do not address issues of maintaining international \r\npeace and security. We often have the impression that \r\nthe General Assembly has merged into the Security \r\nCouncil. We believe that debates on such issues should \r\ntake place in the General Assembly, where all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations can speak on an equal \r\nbasis, giving greater impetus to the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI would like to thank the President for his leadership \r\nand to congratulate the Permanent Representatives of \r\nCroatia and Namibia for the historic advance in the \r\nrecent resolution on the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly. Their confirmation as co-Chairs \r\nreaffirms our belief in the possibility of the concrete \r\nand significant progress that remains to be achieved \r\nand the certainty that positive results can be obtained \r\nwhen Member States work with the shared goal of \r\nimproving this Organization with effectiveness, ethics \r\nand transparency.\r\nColombia aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nResolution 69/321 strengthens four key elements \r\nconcerning the principal deliberative organ of the \r\nUnited Nations: its role, its authority, its efficiency and \r\nits effectiveness. In that regard, I would like to stress \r\nthe work of the General Assembly with respect to the \r\nnomination, selection and designation of the person \r\nwho will succeed Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon at \r\nthe end of 2016 in a transparent and inclusive manner, \r\nwith changes that include, first, the circulation of a joint \r\nletter from the Presidents of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council, on which many delegations have \r\ninsisted; secondly, a timetable for the process; thirdly, a \r\nlist with the names of the candidates and their curricula \r\nvitae that will enable all Member States to analyse the \r\nexperience and qualities of each; and, fourthly, the \r\nholding of hearings, both formal and informal, in the \r\nGeneral Assembly such that all Member States without \r\nexception, large and small, can interact with the \r\ncandidates and experience the traditional trappings of a \r\ndemocratic process, which have now been incorporated \r\ninto the election process of the United Nations.\r\nA fifth element of immense importance to my \r\ndelegation is the inclusion, for the first time in the \r\nOrganization’s 70 years of existence, of a call to present \r\nwomen as candidates for the highest post of global \r\ndiplomacy, which represents a genuine contribution by \r\nthe United Nations to the highest principles for which \r\nit has fought in recent years, as President Lykketoft \r\nhimself noted in his statement this morning. In that \r\nregard, I would like to recall the initiative, so far joined \r\nby 50 countries, to create a group of friends in favour \r\nof a woman candidate to be the next Secretary-General, \r\nprompted by the conviction that in 11 months we will \r\nbe making history.\r\nAchievements such as those set out in the recently \r\nadopted resolution 69/321, on the revitalization of the \r\nwork of theGeneral Assembly, are certainly important, \r\nbut they do not imply that the work of strengthening \r\nthe principal deliberative organ of the United Nations \r\nhas been fully realized. As both the President and \r\nthe Secretary-General have stressed, tasks still to be \r\naccomplished and on which we should make headway \r\nduring this session include increasing cooperation \r\nand integration among organs and maximizing the \r\nefficient use of resources. There needs to be equitable \r\nrepresentation and geographical distribution within \r\nthe United Nations, and both working methods and \r\naccountability need to be improved across the diverse \r\nstructures that form the system to make them more \r\nefficient, but also more transparent, credible and \r\nlegitimate, in order to respond to the challenges in the \r\nagendas on development, security and human rights.\r\nColombia firmly believes that such steps will \r\nenable us to achieve a revitalized General Assembly \r\nthat will be more capable of fulfilling the mandate that \r\nMember States have entrusted to it of promoting among \r\nnations, on the basis of respect, the principle of equal \r\nrights and universal peace.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt): Egypt fully associates \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nAlgeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nI thank the President for convening this important \r\nmeeting on agenda items 119 and 120. I am also pleased \r\nby the reappointment of the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Croatia and Namibia as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\n20/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nthe General Assembly. I congratulate them on their \r\nremarkable achievements during the past session, \r\nand I assure them of my delegation’s full support and \r\ncooperation in addressing the important tasks ahead of \r\nus this year.\r\nGiven the central role of the General Assembly as \r\nthe chief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations, Egypt believes that the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nis an integral part of the broader efforts aimed at \r\nstrengthening the entire Organization. Improving the \r\nefficiency and effectiveness of the Assembly is indeed \r\nan essential step towards creating an Organization that \r\nis more democratic, inclusive and capable of effectively \r\nundertaking its responsibilities, as enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Ensuring the \r\nimplementation of its resolutions, including those \r\nrelated to revitalization, is critical to enhancing the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly. In this context, \r\nEgypt welcomes the adoption of resolution 69/321 and \r\nstresses the importance of fully implementing all its \r\nprovisions.\r\nThanks to the diligent efforts of the Working Group, \r\nimportant improvements have been introduced to the \r\nworking methods of the General Assembly, notably the \r\nearly election of the members of the Security Council \r\nand the Economic and Social Council, six months prior \r\nto their assumption of responsibilities. This is in effect \r\nin the current session of the General Assembly, with \r\nthe aim of enabling them to prepare sufficiently for \r\ntheir new tasks. There is a need to continue improving \r\nthe working methods of the General Assembly, \r\nand particularly its Main Committees, to ensure an \r\nefficient management and effective conduct of their \r\nsteadily increasing workloads, and first and foremost \r\nto sufficiently empower the office of the President with \r\nthe resources and staffing to enable it to implement its \r\nchallenging task.\r\nThe challenges facing the United Nations \r\ntoday — from combating terrorism and maintaining \r\npeace to achieving sustainable development and \r\naddressing the root causes of conflicts — are daunting. \r\nMeeting them requires enhanced cooperation among \r\nthe principal organs of the United Nations in a mutually \r\nreinforcing and complementary relationship, while \r\nrespecting the balance among their respective functions \r\nand mandates, as enshrined in the Charter.\r\nThe open debate on the working methods of the \r\nSecurity Council held on 20 October (see S/PV.7539), in \r\nthe presence and with the contribution of the Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, demonstrated the desire of the wider \r\nmembership for enhanced cooperation among these \r\nbodies to ensure a more holistic approach to sustaining \r\npeace and to forge stronger linkages among the three \r\npillars of the work of the United Nations. In that regard, \r\nEgypt welcomes the Security Council’s adoption of \r\nits first-ever presidential statement (S/PRST/2015/19) \r\nfocused entirely on its working methods, in which \r\nthe Council underscored the importance of increased \r\ncoordination, cooperation and interaction among the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations.\r\nLastly, I wish to address the issue of the appointment \r\nof the new Secretary-General. Egypt believes that the \r\nlandmark resolution 69/321, which was adopted by \r\nconsensus in September, paves the way for a predictable, \r\ntransparent and merit-based selection process. The \r\nresolution addresses some of the multiple imperfections \r\nthat have negatively impacted the selection process for \r\nthe past 70 years. Our collective responsibility now is \r\nto ensure its timely and effective implementation. We \r\nare mindful that some very important aspects of this \r\nprocess remain subject to further consideration during \r\nthe current session. We are hopeful that the same spirit \r\nof understanding and accommodation that led to the \r\nadoption of resolution 69/321 by consensus will guide \r\nthe next phase of our work.\r\nAs an elected member of the Security Council, \r\nand through its membership of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly, Egypt will exert its utmost efforts to \r\nguarantee that the process will be inclusive, open and \r\ndemocratic, and that the voices of all Members will be \r\nheard and duly considered throughout the process.\r\nMr. Mamabolo (South Africa): My delegation fully \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nAllow me to congratulate the co-Chairs of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly on the four thematic \r\nissues during this seventieth session. We welcome the \r\nreappointment of the Ambassadors of Namibia and \r\nCroatia to steer the ship.\r\n15-34703 21/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate its strong \r\nbelief that the General Assembly remains the main \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ \r\nof the United Nations, and that it is our responsibility \r\nas Member States to ensure that the Assembly remains \r\nrelevant and responsive to the needs of the populations \r\nwe serve. It is therefore appropriate that during this \r\nseventieth session the General Assembly, through \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group, should again discuss the \r\ncritical issue of the selection and appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General and other executive heads with \r\nrenewed vigour.\r\nSouth Africa fully endorses the urgent, near \r\nuniversal call of the membership, as voiced by several \r\ngroups, including the Non-Aligned Movement, for the \r\nappointment process for the next Secretary-General \r\nfinally breaks from the antiquated process established \r\nby resolution 11 (I) of 1946. It is time for the most \r\nrepresentative Organization in the world to appoint \r\nits chief administrative officer through a transparent \r\nand inclusive process, with due consideration for \r\npre-established selection criteria, gender equality and \r\ngeographic representation. That can be achieved only if \r\nthe process of selecting and appointing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral becomes more structured and starts with a call \r\nfor applications.\r\nIn this modern day and age, such appointment \r\nstipulations are critical to ensuring that the best \r\ncandidate for the position is selected and that the \r\nSecretary-General can be held accountable to the \r\nGeneral Assembly and not only to a select few. To \r\nthat end, we call for a joint letter by the Presidents \r\nof the General Assembly and the Security Council to \r\nofficially launch the selection process by describing \r\nthe process and inviting candidates to be presented in a \r\ntimely manner. A list of the selection criteria, including \r\nproven leadership and managerial abilities, extensive \r\nexperience in international relations and strong \r\ndiplomatic, communication and multilingual skills, is \r\na prerequisite.\r\nWe request that the Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council continuously \r\nupdate the curricula vitae of prospective candidates \r\nand that they avail themselves of the opportunity for \r\ninformal dialogue with the broader membership of the \r\nOrganization. There is above all a strong need for the \r\nappointment of a Secretary-General who embodies the \r\nhighest standards of efficiency, competency, integrity \r\nand a strong commitment to the principles and purposes \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, together with the \r\nvalues and objectives of the Organization.\r\nThis year, which marks the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the establishment of the United Nations, provides a \r\nseminal opportunity for Member States to reinvigorate \r\nthe Organization as a whole and to continue our \r\nefforts for the revitalization of the General Assembly. \r\nThe General Assembly’s role, authority and working \r\nmethods must be strengthened to restore its rightful \r\nplace at the centre of the global governance system. \r\nIn addition to emphasizing the issues of greater \r\ntransparency and inclusiveness, South Africa shares \r\nthe view strongly held by many Member States that \r\nthe General Assembly should be given a prominent \r\nrole on all critical issues, including the selection and \r\nappointment processes for the new Secretary-General, \r\nthat goes beyond merely rubber-stamping the choice of \r\na select few Members of the United Nations.\r\nWe do not share the view expressed by a small \r\nminority of States that it is premature at this stage \r\nto discuss the selection and appointment of the next \r\nSecretary-General. In that regard, South Africa \r\nexpresses its hope that the Council’s discussion will \r\nresult in full engagement with the General Assembly. \r\nThe broad interest in the issue and the fervour with \r\nwhich the important matter has repeatedly been raised \r\nin the Ad Hoc Working Group in recent years attests \r\nto the fact that the matter is urgent. We trust that the \r\nurgency of our discussions will translate into a more \r\ndemocratic process. Such a democratic process needs to \r\ninclude a thorough consideration of the nomination of \r\nmultiple candidates for the post of Secretary-General, \r\nas well as that of seriously considering a single term \r\nlimit for the next appointee.\r\nIn closing, my delegation looks forward to continued \r\nrich discussion during this session on the issue and on \r\nthe other three core thematic issues: enhancing the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly, improving the \r\nworking methods of the Assembly, and strengthening \r\nthe institutional memory of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Rakhmetullin (Kazakhstan): At the outset, my \r\ndelegation wishes to express its immense gratitude to \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia \r\nfor their effective conduct of the work of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group during the past session. We assure \r\nthem of our full support in their future endeavours at \r\nthe current session.\r\n22/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations \r\ncalls for a highly effective General Assembly as the key \r\ndeliberative, representative and policymaking organ \r\nof the United Nations. We are facing new issues and \r\npriorities that demand efficient working methods and \r\nnew approaches. Today more than ever, the General \r\nAssembly must address the needs and interests of all \r\nStates, particularly those in vulnerable groups, such as \r\nthe least developed countries, small island developing \r\nStates and landlocked countries. My delegation would \r\nlike to present a few points for consideration.\r\nThe General Assembly, due to its comprehensive \r\nmembership, should be able to bring new, enhanced \r\nperspectives to the issues of peace and security that \r\ncould add value to the Security Council’s work, with \r\nthe two organs working in close cooperation so that \r\nthey do not compete but rather complement each other. \r\nEven though the General Assembly’s decisions are \r\nnot binding, it could facilitate speedy and sufficient \r\nresponses to challenges.\r\nA revitalized General Assembly should be able \r\nto meet the acute contemporary challenges of wars \r\nand conflicts. Our central task in the twenty-first \r\ncentury should be to implement a strategy that would \r\ncompletely eliminate wars, their threats and causes. \r\nFor that purpose, President Nursultan Nazarbayev \r\nof Kazakhstan proposed in the general debate of the \r\nseventieth session (see A/70/PV.13) that by the United \r\nNations centenary in 2045, a global strategic initiative \r\nplan should be agreed to pave the way for a world \r\ntotally free of conflicts, provide fair conditions for all \r\nnations to have equal access to world infrastructure, \r\nresources and markets, and maintain comprehensive \r\naccountability for human development.\r\nWith peace, security, sustainable development, \r\nhuman rights and gender equality becoming paramount \r\nimperatives today, the General Assembly agenda will \r\nhave to be well conceived, structured and sequenced to \r\nobtain optimal outcomes. Such clear delineation would \r\nalso strengthen the General Assembly’s authority and \r\nstanding. While trying to preserve the principle of \r\nconsensus, we should avoid weak resolutions and focus \r\ndebates on the substance rather than on the process. \r\nIn our striving for inclusion and integration, we must \r\nensure that results take us to a new level each time. \r\nAll General Assembly resolutions must be given due \r\nattention so that they are implemented in a proper, \r\ntimely and inclusive manner.\r\nIn addition, the General Assembly’s agenda should \r\nbe streamlined so as to avoid duplication and allow us \r\nto concentrate on properly applying our time, efforts \r\nand resources to core problems. It is therefore obvious \r\nthat the process of biennializing and triennializing \r\nresolution cycles and the periodicity of agenda items \r\nshould be undertaken in an appropriate and balanced \r\nway.\r\nMy delegation wants to underline the importance \r\nof the General Assembly’s close collaboration with the \r\nSecretariat for the purposes of internal coordination, \r\ngreater rationalization and streamlining the agenda \r\nto avoid duplication with other bodies in the United \r\nNations system. Furthermore, serious consideration \r\nmust be given to the scheduling of high-level events, \r\nboth in terms of number and distribution throughout the \r\nyear, so as to ensure the highest level of participation, \r\nthe review of proposals and the monitoring of their \r\nresults and success.\r\nMy delegation wants to underline the importance of \r\nthe comprehensive institutional memory of the General \r\nAssembly. In that regard, we strongly believe that the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s efficiency and the President’s \r\nabilities and capacity should in no way be confined by \r\nfinancial constraints. That is why my delegation joins \r\nthe call for the greater allocation of funds from the \r\nUnited Nations regular budget to provide the President \r\nwith wider support from the Secretariat.\r\nWe believe that the reform process should encompass \r\nall the main organs of the United Nations. Along with our \r\njoint efforts to increase the effectiveness of the General \r\nAssembly, the optimization of other United Nations \r\nentities is equally important. To that end, the President \r\nof Kazakhstan has also proposed to transform the \r\nEconomic and Social Council into a global development \r\ncouncil, thereby uniting States Members of the United \r\nNations and other United Nations specialized agencies, \r\nincluding the International Monetary Fund, tasked to \r\nbecome a global economic regulator.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my country’s \r\ninterest in and readiness to support new efforts and to \r\nengage in the work on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Jinga (Romania): We very much welcome \r\nthe 19 October 2015 letter of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly informing Member States of the \r\nreappointment of the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the revitalization of the work of the General \r\n15-34703 23/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nAssembly. We believe that it serves as recognition of their \r\nexcellent during the previous session, which culminated \r\nin the adoption of the cornerstone resolution 69/321. It \r\nis also a clear indication of the strong commitment of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly to promoting \r\nfurther concrete positive developments on the matter. \r\nIt gives me great pleasure to congratulate Ambassador \r\nVladimir Drobnjak, Permanent Representative of \r\nCroatia, and Ambassador Wilfried Emvula, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Namibia, on their reappointment. \r\nI wish to assure them of my delegation’s complete \r\ncooperation.\r\nIt goes without saying that Romania aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union. I wish now to make a few brief \r\nremarks in my national capacity.\r\nWe highly appreciate the call of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for two important annual debates, to \r\nbe held in conjunction. As we heard in many statements \r\ndelivered on Friday under agenda item 121, concerning \r\nreform of the Security Council and related matters, the \r\ntwo processes are to be considered as complementary \r\nand mutually reinforcing. We share the view that the \r\nadaptation process of United Nations bodies must \r\nensure that the entire system becomes fit for purpose \r\nand committed to action, pursuant to the recently \r\nadopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1, annex).\r\nToday, I would like to refer to two concrete aspects \r\nbeing discussed under those agenda items: working \r\nmethods and the selection and appointment of the new \r\nSecretary-General. Over the past couple of years, we \r\nhave seen much progress in making the activities of \r\nthe General Assembly more efficient and in line with \r\nrecent developments. Nevertheless, we believe that \r\na lot more remains to be done in order to continue \r\nrationalizing the agenda. In that context, my delegation \r\nexpresses its appreciation for the work and proposal of \r\nthe Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group.\r\nAlong the lines of the European Union’s call for \r\nfurther examination of the possibility of discussing \r\nitems or introducing resolutions over a longer period, \r\nI would like to draw attention to the fact that Romania \r\nand Germany have already proceeded in that matter, \r\nincluding on the First Committee draft resolution \r\nentitled “Objective information on military matters, \r\nincluding transparency of military expenditures” \r\n(A/C.1/70/L.17). We invite other States to also \r\ncontemplate that possibility, especially as it will have \r\nbeen noticed that many new issues are emerging from \r\nAgenda 2030.\r\nThe second aspect that I would like to underline is \r\nthe importance Romania attaches to the process — which \r\nwe hope will begin soon — for the selection of the \r\nnext Secretary-General. We were pleased to see the \r\nconstructive way in which delegations worked together \r\nto adopt resolution 69/321 by consensus, especially \r\nthe specific and concrete provisions on that matter. \r\nWe strongly hope that all of them will be implemented \r\nso that the process will become more transparent, \r\npredictable and inclusive. We look forward to further \r\nsteps, such as the joint letter of the Presidents of \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, a \r\npermanent update of the list of candidates, and the \r\norganization of meetings with the candidates, while of \r\ncourse fully observing the provisions of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nAt the same time, we call on all United Nations \r\nStates Members to pay special attention to the fact that, \r\nduring its 70 years of existence, the Organization has \r\nnever had a representative from Eastern Europe at its \r\nhelm. We believe that it is high time to correct that \r\nhistorical injustice. Member States from the Group of \r\nEastern European States have the same great potential \r\nto successfully fulfil the challenging mandate of \r\nSecretary-General as the representatives of all other \r\ngeographic groups entrusted with that honour and \r\nresponsibility.\r\nMr. Mwinyi (United Republic of Tanzania): My \r\ndelegation would like to thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for convening this important annual \r\njoint debate on agenda items 119 and 120. We thank \r\nand commend the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly for their dedication and continued leadership, \r\nwhich facilitated the adoption of resolution 69/321, \r\nwhose celebrated provisions will be implemented \r\nduring the current session.\r\nWe align ourselves fully with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Algeria on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement, and would like to make \r\nsome additional remarks in our national capacity.\r\nFirst, we wish to reiterate our keen interest in the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly. \r\nThis chief deliberative policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations has tremendous potential \r\n24/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\nand an even greater role to play in its seventieth year \r\nof existence. As such, our work towards bolstering its \r\nrole, authority and working methods must be part of the \r\noverall reform of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, we welcome the unfading spirit \r\nof multilateralism that is manifested through the \r\nadoption of the resolutions of this organ and its Main \r\nCommittees. While welcoming those outcomes, some \r\nof which have undergone a strenuous process, we wish \r\nto underline the importance of timely implementation \r\nby all concerned. We note that a lack of implementation \r\nonly serves to undermine the authority and credibility \r\nof this important organ and its member States. It \r\nis imperative, therefore, that we strive for quality, \r\nnot quantity; foster a culture of accountability, not \r\nimpunity; and find effective ways to rationalize and \r\nmonitor the implementation of those resolutions.\r\nThirdly, we wish to underline the importance of \r\ncooperation among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations in a complementary and mutually reinforcing \r\nmanner, while adhering to their respective mandates, \r\nin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWe welcome the continued interactions with and \r\nsubmission of annual reports by the Security Council, \r\nthe Economic and Social Council and the Secretariat \r\nto the General Assembly. We would like to see a \r\nqualitative improvement of those reports, especially \r\ntheir analytical aspects. We note with great satisfaction \r\nthe continuing interaction between the General \r\nAssembly and international and regional forums and \r\norganizations, as well as civil society, as appropriate. \r\nThe consultation with stakeholders held prior to \r\nintergovernmental processes is truly commendable and \r\nillustrative of the partnerships that we must forge to \r\novercome the complex challenges of our time.\r\nFourthly, we welcome the instructive provisions \r\nof resolution 69/321 pertaining to the selection of the \r\nnext Secretary-General in respect of the issuance of \r\nthe joint letter from the Presidents of the Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council soliciting candidates for this post; \r\nthe publishing of the list of candidates; and the holding \r\nof informal meetings with interested candidates. We \r\nbelieve that, after two decades of championing for gender \r\nequality and female empowerment, we will witness \r\nthe participation of competent female candidates and, \r\nwe hope, the election of the first woman Secretary-\r\nGeneral. For Tanzania, such a development would be \r\nan achievement commensurate with the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the Organization, and could serve as a \r\nprecursor for achieving further reform, including of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nLast but not least, we second the calls for \r\nstrengthening the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly. We certainly can do more to enhance the \r\ninstitutional memory of the Office, including by \r\nexploring the option of allocating dedicated Secretariat \r\nstaff to complement and reinforce staffing from \r\nMember States, which is a costly endeavour that many \r\ndeveloping countries cannot shoulder. In that regard, \r\nwe must review the budget allocation to the Office of \r\nthe President with a view to ensuring adequate and \r\npredictable resources to the Office. Failure is not an \r\noption. The stakes are too enormous. We must strive to \r\npreserve the authority, credibility and integrity of the \r\nOffice of the President.\r\nMr. Adamov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): The \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Belarus aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by the representative of Algeria \r\non behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement. We take this \r\nopportunity to express our gratitude to Algeria for its \r\nsystemic and consistent formulation and promotion of \r\nthe positions of the Movement as one of the key players \r\nin the process of revitalizing the work of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nOur delegation fully supports the decision of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession to extend the co-chairmanships of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Namibia and Croatia of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group. We note that resolution 69/321, which \r\nwas formulated under their chairmanship, contains \r\nmany important and timely elements, including making \r\nthe possibility of reaching a decision on other issues at \r\nthis session. Belarus firmly believes that the valuable \r\nexperience the co-Chairs have accumulated over \r\nthe past year will enable them to achieve even more \r\nimpressive success.\r\nIn our view, the joint debate on the two agenda \r\nitems — “Implementation of the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations” and “Revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly” — is symbolic. However carefully \r\nresolution 69/321 may be worded, it is entirely up to us, \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations, to determine \r\nwhether the resolution will serve as a catalyst for the \r\nurgent changes needed in the work of the Organization \r\nor join the remarkable list of unfulfilled General \r\nAssembly resolutions.\r\n15-34703 25/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nWe commend the efforts to restore the procedures \r\nfor the election of the Secretary-General as envisaged \r\nin the General Assembly’s rules of procedure. The \r\nBelarusian delegation believes that it is crucial to ensure \r\nthat, for the first time in many years, no State large \r\nor small is denied a genuine opportunity to express its \r\nopinion about the candidacies for Secretary-General.\r\nMy delegation also hopes to see a substantive and \r\nopen dialogue with the leadership of the Secretariat on \r\nissues related to the daily work of the Organization. The \r\nnumber of outstanding issues and the organization of the \r\nwork needed to address them require action to be taken \r\nby the General Assembly, as provided for by resolution \r\n69/321. That may seem insignificant considering the \r\nchallenges and problems facing our Organization, but \r\nit is precisely on such details that the general context \r\nand organization of our collective work and, ultimately, \r\nits effectiveness, depend on. We intend to continue our \r\nfocused and constructive efforts to revitalize the work \r\nof the General Assembly in the future.\r\nMr. Sobral Duarte (Brazil): I would like to thank \r\nthe President for convening today’s joint debate, which \r\ngives us an opportunity to discuss issues directly \r\nrelated to the proper functioning and legitimacy of our \r\nOrganization. We are grateful for his initial comments \r\non the items on the Assembly’s agenda today and for \r\nthe statement by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. I \r\nwould also like to commend the reappointment for \r\nthe Assembly’s seventieth session of Ambassador \r\nVladimir Drobnjak, Permanent Representative of \r\nCroatia, and Ambassador Wilfried Emvula, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Namibia, as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nWe support efforts to streamline the agenda and \r\nworking methods of the General Assembly and its \r\nMain Committees. We also support strengthening \r\nthe Office of the President of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich should be provided with adequate resources \r\nfrom the Organization’s regular budget. We welcome \r\nthe President’s presentation today of his code of \r\nconduct for integrity, impartiality, transparency, \r\naccountability, professionalism and effectiveness \r\naimed at strengthening our institutional memory. \r\nThe consideration of General Assembly resolutions is \r\nparticularly important. It is essential that we identify \r\nand eliminate constraints on their implementation. In \r\nthat regard, we encourage the Ad Hoc Working Group \r\nto continue to review and update the inventory of \r\nAssembly resolutions on revitalization.\r\nThere is a broad consensus that the selection of the \r\nnext Secretary-General should be more transparent, \r\ninclusive and democratic. Member States and civil \r\nsociety share that view. Important organizations, such \r\nas The Elders and 1 for 7 Billion, have recently launched \r\nsuccessful awareness campaigns about the issue. \r\nResolution 69/321 introduced significant improvements \r\ninto the selection process. It will start with a joint letter \r\nfrom the Presidents of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, addressed to all Member States, \r\nsoliciting candidates for the position, and we look \r\nforward to that letter’s speedy issuance. Candidates \r\nare expected to take part in informal dialogues and \r\nmeetings with Member States; objective criteria and \r\nqualifications will be required; and Member States will \r\nconsider presenting women as candidates.\r\nAmong those changes, the most transformative is \r\nthe organization of informal dialogues and meetings \r\nproviding all Member States with the opportunity to \r\ninteract with candidates and hear their proposals. The \r\ninvitation to present women as candidates is another \r\nimportant step forward. Other ways to address the \r\ngender issue can be considered as well. One would \r\nbe to ensure that the Secretary-General and Deputy \r\nSecretary-General are of different genders. Another \r\nwould be to make sure that the next Secretary-General \r\nis fully committed to the empowerment of women. The \r\naforementioned meetings with Member States could \r\nbe an interesting occasion for testing the candidates’ \r\ncredentials on the issue.\r\nWe must bear in mind that in order to select the \r\nbest candidate, it is also necessary to consider the times \r\nwe live in and the specific moment being experienced \r\nby the United Nations. Of the three pillars of this \r\nOrganization — peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights — that of peace and security is probably \r\ngenerating the most visible credibility deficit for the \r\nUnited Nations. The creation of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the establishment of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals have provided us with a road map \r\nfor the other two pillars. That of peace and security, \r\nhowever, is facing vital challenges, both substantive \r\nand with regard to governance. The next Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be able to provide leadership in that \r\narea. In addition, he or she should be supportive of \r\nmore democratic and participatory ways to address \r\n26/27 15-34703\r\nA/70/PV.45 03/11/2015\r\npeace and security so as to increase the efficiency of \r\nUnited Nations efforts in that regard.\r\nAlthough resolution 69/321 will be fundamental \r\nto strengthening the role of the General Assembly in \r\nthe selection of the next Secretary-General, it could \r\nhave touched on other aspects of the process that will \r\ncontinue to warrant our attention. The first concerns \r\nthe possibility of the Security Council sending more \r\nthan one name for consideration by the Assembly. The \r\nselection would be more democratic if the General \r\nAssembly had more options than either approving or \r\nrejecting a single candidate. As suggested by former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan, the Security Council \r\ncould send a list of three candidates to be considered \r\nby the Assembly.\r\nSecondly, another important item discussed in \r\nthe framework of the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly is the process of appointing the other \r\nexecutive heads of the Organization, including the \r\nDeputy Secretary-General and the Under-Secretary-\r\nGenerals, which should also be conducted with more \r\ntransparency and inclusivity. The practice of reserving \r\ncertain positions for specific countries raises legitimate \r\nquestions. Article 101 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations clearly states that the paramount consideration \r\nin the employment of the staff of the Secretariat should \r\nbe the necessity of securing the highest standards of \r\nefficiency, competence and integrity. The same Article \r\nstates that the Secretary-General should appoint \r\nmembers of the Secretariat according to regulations \r\nestablished by the General Assembly. The General \r\nAssembly should exercise that prerogative to ensure \r\nthat these appointments are subject to more transparent \r\ncriteria and made on the basis of merit.\r\nThere is a growing demand on the part of Member \r\nStates and civil society for more transparency and \r\naccountability within the United Nations. The same \r\nimpetus that prompts Member States to intensify their \r\nefforts for decisive action on Security Council reform \r\nduring the seventieth session is now expressing itself in \r\nthe widespread support for a democratic, inclusive and \r\nrevitalized General Assembly that will fully exercise \r\nits role, including on such questions as the selection of \r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nMr. Niyazaliev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations. This special event provides a \r\nunique opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to \r\nstrengthening the role of General Assembly as the \r\nchief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations system. We must sieze \r\nthis opportunity not only to note the shortcomings and \r\nsuccesses of the work of the General Assembly over the \r\npast 70 years, but also to draft new decisions aimed at \r\nenhancing its role and authority in line with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic believes that the General \r\nAssembly, as the principal deliberative and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations system, \r\nshould play a lead role in resolving issues of peace and \r\nsecurity; discussing and designing recommendations \r\non socioeconomic, cultural, humanitarian and \r\nenvironmental problems; promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights; and bolstering friendly relations among \r\nStates. In that regard, the Kyrgyz Republic advocates \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nand enhancing its role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nactities.\r\nThe Kyrgyz Republic welcomes the efforts \r\nundertaken during the sixty-ninth session to improve the \r\nwork of the General Assembly. Above all, we welcome \r\nthe unanimous adoption on 11 September of resolution \r\n69/321, entitled “Revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.” We support the report of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly (A/69/1007). I take this opportunity \r\nto thank the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group, \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia, \r\nfor their active and fruitful work during the sixty-ninth \r\nsession, and congratulate them on their reappointment \r\nto those positions for the current session. Under their \r\nleadership, we will discuss four main issues: the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly; the working \r\nmethods of the General Assembly; the selection and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General and other \r\nexecutive heads of agencies within the United Nations \r\nsystem; and enhancing the institutional memory of the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly.\r\nThe creation of multilingual web pages devoted \r\nto this subject on the website of the United Nations \r\nin all official languages was very useful and timely. \r\nParticular attention should be given to the proposals to \r\nimprove the working methods of the Main Committees \r\nof the General Assembly, submitted by the Chairs of the \r\nMain Committees at a thematic meeting of the Ad Hoc \r\n15-34703 27/27\r\n03/11/2015 A/70/PV.45\r\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, held on 14 April.\r\nIn recent years, much has been done to improve the \r\nwork of the General Assembly, but much remains to be \r\ndone. As asserted in resolution 69/321, it is important \r\nto enhance cooperation between the General Assembly \r\nand the international and regional organizations in \r\naddressing contemporary global problems. In addition, \r\nthe agenda of the General Assembly grows longer every \r\nyear and the number of resolutions continues to grow. \r\nWe believe that particular attention must be given to \r\nstreamlining the agenda of the General Assembly and \r\nenhancing the institutional memory of the Office of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly. We support the \r\nproposal to move some agenda items to a biennial and \r\ntriennial basis, and to merge or exclude certain items.\r\nFinally, I wish to assure the President of my \r\ndelegation’s full support in his efforts to revitalize \r\nthe General Assembly and to strengthen its role and \r\nauthority.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Peru \r\nendorses the statement delivered by the representatives \r\nof Algeria on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement and \r\nof Estonia on behalf of the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group, respectively.\r\nMy delegation joins others in recognizing the \r\nwork carried out during the sixty-ninth session by the \r\nAmbassadors of Croatia, Mr. Vladimir Drobnjak, and \r\nNamibia, Mr. Wilfried Emvula, as co-Chairs of Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We welcome their re-appointment \r\nas co-Chairs for this session.\r\nPeru recognizes the importance of the consensus \r\nadoption of resolution 69/321, which reaffirms the \r\nfunctions and authority of the Assembly, recognizes \r\nthe pressing need for this organ to review its working \r\nmethods, commits resources to strengthen the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly, and further \r\nreaffirms the role of the General Assembly in the \r\nprocess of selecting and appointing the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral. My delegation believes that this last point \r\nshould be given particular consideration given that we \r\nwill elect the next Secretary-General next year. The \r\ngrowing challenges that face our Organization require \r\nus to strive to identify and designate the best possible \r\ncandidates for the position of Secretary-General and \r\nto adhere to the principles of gender equality and the \r\ncriterion of regional rotation in that regard.\r\nWhen Article 97 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations was drafted, our predecessors were aware that, \r\nalthough the Secretary-General has a global mandate \r\nto serve all States Members of the Organization, there \r\nmust also be very close coordination between the \r\nSecretary-General and the Security Council so that \r\nthe United Nations can achieve concrete results in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nBearing in mind the process established in Article \r\n97 of the Charter, Peru believes that greater interaction \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General Assembly \r\nin the process of selecting and appointing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations is essential. In that regard, \r\nwe appreciate the stress placed in resolution 69/321 on \r\nthe role to be played by the General Assembly — the \r\nsole universal organ of our Organization in which all \r\nStates are equally and democratically represented — in \r\nthat important process.\r\nThe procedure set out in resolution 69/321 \r\nresponds to the demand of the membership for greater \r\nparticipation and transparency in the important \r\ntask of choosing the successor of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-Moon. We are convinced that the proper \r\nimplementation of the provisions of that resolution \r\nwill give greater legitimacy to the way in which the \r\nnext Secretary-General is elected and help us to select \r\nthe best candidate, which will undoubtedly benefit the \r\nwork of whoever assumes the job.\r\nThe President has a twofold mission. He must \r\nplay an active role in the process of selecting and \r\nappointing the Secretary-General from the outset of \r\nthat process, by issuing a joint letter with the President \r\nof the Security Council and by convening and leading \r\ndialogues with the candidates and the membership. He \r\nalso faces the great challenge of ensuring the effective \r\nimplementation of resolution 69/321 in that process. \r\nIndeed, implementation is key. We trust in his capacity \r\nto lead that process and his political will to fulfil \r\nthese mandates, both of which are highlight important \r\nto the Organization. My delegation is committed to \r\nparticipating actively and constructively in that process.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
