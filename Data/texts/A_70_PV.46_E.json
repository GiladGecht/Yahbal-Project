Without any doubt, slavery remains one of \r\nthe darkest chapters in our past, and in this seventieth \r\nanniversary year of the United Nations it is timely that \r\nwe recommit ourselves to raising public awareness \r\nabout its legacy of unprecedented horror.\r\nAs we meet today we should continue to honour \r\nthe enslaved Africans and their descendants and \r\nrecognize their respective contributions to our world \r\nand societies. The latest report of the Secretary-General \r\n(see A/70/221) highlights the educational outreach and \r\npublic-awareness efforts undertaken to commemorate \r\nand honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. In this regard, I commend the Department \r\nof Public Information for selecting the topic “Women \r\nand slavery” as the theme for 2015. As one historian \r\ntells us, to be a slave and female was a triple-edged \r\nsword — a slave woman was black in a white society, a \r\nslave in a free society, and a woman in a society ruled \r\nby men.\r\nDespite the hardships, enslaved African women \r\nwere largely responsible for preserving and passing on \r\nthe culture and traditions that form such an integral \r\npart of the African diaspora of the Americas and the \r\nCaribbean that we know today. This year’s theme \r\ntherefore is timely and relevant, and we should pay \r\ntribute to those women who contributed immensely to \r\nthe abolition of slavery and the creation of our societies. \r\nI should like to commend the sustained commitment \r\nand actions of Member States to ensure that this \r\nissue remains a priority of the General Assembly. In \r\nparticular I wish to recognize the dedication of the \r\nStates members of the Caribbean Community and the \r\nGroup of African States for their efforts over the years.\r\nLet me also take the opportunity to congratulate \r\nthe Permanent Memorial Committee for its tireless \r\nefforts, which resulted in the construction and \r\nunveiling earlier this year of the permanent memorial \r\nto honour the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. We are thankful also to those Member \r\nStates, organizations and individuals who contributed \r\nto the creation of the memorial and eagerly anticipate \r\nthe conclusion of the final steps in the project. I \r\nlook forward also to the collaboration between the \r\nSecretariat and States members of the Assembly aimed \r\nat promoting the annual observation of the International \r\nDay of Remembrance for the Victims of Slavery and the \r\nTransatlantic Slave Trade as reflected in the reports of \r\nthe Secretary-General.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.46\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n46th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 4 November 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/17 15-34949\r\nA/70/PV.46 04/11/2015\r\nWhile significant progress has been achieved since \r\nthe abolition of slavery and the slave trade, the struggles \r\nof millions of descendants of enslaved Africans did not \r\nend with the close of that dark chapter. The challenge \r\nfacing us all today is to take concerted action to fight \r\nall forms of discrimination, including institutional \r\nracism and gender discrimination, and to eradicate \r\ncontemporary forms and manifestations of slavery, \r\nincluding sexual slavery, of which women and girls are \r\nthe primary victims. Many of these matters are at the \r\ncore of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), whose implementation must be \r\na priority for all Governments and for all of us. It is \r\ncrucial also that we maintain our political commitment \r\nto the principles of the United Nations Charter, the \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, and all other \r\ninternational human rights standards relevant also to \r\nthis case.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Jamaica \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/70/L.5.\r\nMs. Richards (Jamaica): I am honoured to introduce \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.5 for the consideration of the \r\nAssembly. The Caribbean Community (CARICOM) \r\nand African member States collaborated with a wide \r\nrange of partners to arrive at a text that truly reflects \r\nthe consensus which similar resolutions have enjoyed \r\nover past years. The draft, as is customary, enjoys the \r\nfull support of the membership, as demonstrated in its \r\nsponsorship by the vast majority of Member States.\r\nI thank the Secretary-General for the two reports \r\nsubmitted under this agenda item, the first being on \r\nthe status of the Trust Fund and the second on the \r\neducational outreach activities on slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade.\r\nSince the General Assembly’s last consideration \r\nof this agenda item, we have achieved a lot. Most \r\nsignificantly, the permanent memorial was completed \r\nand unveiled on 25 March 2015. The Ark of Return \r\nnow occupies a prominent place here at United \r\nNations Headquarters, in keeping with the decision of \r\nsuccessive resolutions. Visitors to the United Nations \r\nare not only struck by its captivating presence but also \r\ndrawn to its symbolism and interactive nature. I use this \r\nopportunity to reiterate the gratitude of the members \r\nof the Permanent Memorial Committee, which Jamaica \r\nhas had the honour to chair, for the steadfast support of \r\nthe membership towards the completion of the project. \r\nThe financial contributions made are reflected in the \r\nSecretary-General’s report and every dollar has been \r\nprudently managed by the United Nations Office for \r\nPartnerships. \r\nThe outpouring of financial support in the final \r\nweeks of the fundraising campaign, reinvigorated in \r\nearnest at a pledging luncheon last December, ensured \r\nthat all the funds required were raised. I am proud to \r\nsay that the memorial has been completed on time and \r\non budget. This has been due in no small measure to \r\nthe support received and also to the collaboration with \r\nthe Department of Management, the capital master \r\nplan and the architect and designer, Mr. Rodney Leon, \r\nwhose professionalism and dedication was exemplary.\r\nI encourage everyone to pay a visit to the memorial \r\nand to spend what will prove to be a worthwhile few \r\nmoments of reflection to acknowledge the tragedy \r\nand to consider the legacy. The Ark of Return is not a \r\nmemorial just for people of African descent; it is the \r\nUnited Nations memorial; it belongs to us all.\r\nThe Ark of Return has been erected, yet our work \r\ndoes not cease. As demonstrated in the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report on the educational outreach activities \r\n(A/70/221), there remains broad scope for actions \r\nto teach present and future generations about what \r\nslavery truly was, how it was sustained, how it was \r\nopposed, how it was defeated, and, very importantly, \r\nwhat lingering legacies remain for us to address. The \r\nwork being undertaken by the Department of Public \r\nInformation, both at Headquarters and globally, \r\nis of utmost importance so that the message of the \r\nmemorial can be disseminated widely. Within each \r\nof our countries and regions there is work to be done \r\nto address systemic and ingrained legacies that often \r\nresult in discrimination and other disparate challenges \r\nfaced by the descendants of African slaves.\r\nWe face injustice where we seek justice; we \r\nencounter suppression where we seek empowerment; \r\nwe suffer marginalization where we seek recognition. \r\nThere are social, economic and psychological scars \r\nthat need to be healed in order for us to properly move \r\nforward. And while some of that healing must of \r\nnecessity come from within, it is undeniable that much \r\nmore must come from outside.\r\nIt is quite disappointing that so few Member States \r\ncontributed information on the activities they are \r\nundertaking to ensure that the lessons of slavery are \r\ntaught within their jurisdictions. I encourage Member \r\nStates to implement programmes and activities, \r\nincluding with the support of the United Nations system, \r\n15-34949 3/17\r\n04/11/2015 A/70/PV.46\r\nin particular UNESCO, which has excellent resources, \r\nsuch as its Slave Route project and the General History \r\nof Africa project. \r\nImplementing such programmes and activities \r\nserves to bolster our collective efforts to build a world \r\nof justice and equality, where slavery is eliminated and \r\nits tragic effects are reversed. Let us take the message \r\nof the memorial as our guide. We should acknowledge \r\nthe tragedy. Let us teach the facts and the impacts. We \r\nshould consider the legacy. Let us address systemic \r\nimbalances, redress wrongs and defeat modern-day \r\nslavery. We should never forget.\r\nMr. Kataria (India): I should like to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his reports under the agenda item. \r\nI should also like to pay a rich tribute to Ambassador \r\nCourtenay Rattray, Permanent Representative of \r\nJamaica, for his tireless efforts in making the permanent \r\nmemorial Ark of Return a reality.\r\nThe evil of slavery was deeply rooted in economic \r\ngreed, racism and different forms of discrimination \r\nduring the period of colonization and imperialism. \r\nMillions lost their lives, during the unprecedented \r\nmiddle passage. African civilization was torn apart, \r\nand it left an indelible mark on society for many \r\ngenerations. In this context, I must recall that Prime \r\nMinister Jawaharlal Nehru, speaking at the Asian-\r\nAfrican Conference at Bandung in 1955, in referring \r\nto transatlantic slavery, declared that there was nothing \r\nmore terrible, nothing more horrible, than the infinite \r\ntragedy of Africa in the past few hundred years.\r\nThe historic unveiling of the permanent memorial \r\nArk of Return at the United Nations in March this year \r\nwas a small but significant gesture of remembrance \r\nto the victims of slavery who perished in dark \r\noblivion. It symbolizes long-overdue condemnation \r\nby the international community, which will remind \r\ngenerations to come of the four-century-long grief \r\nand tragedy borne by the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade.\r\nIndia remembers its own tragedy of colonialism \r\nand the export of indentured labour, which was \r\ninitiated to replace freed slaves on sugar plantations \r\nin British colonies in the 1830s. We welcome the \r\nUNESCO International Indentured Labour Route \r\nproject as a complement to the Slave Route project. \r\nIndia’s contribution of $260,000 to the memorial \r\nTrust Fund reflects its sharing the pain and suffering \r\nof the affected countries and their people. We are \r\nhappy to co-sponsor draft resolution A/70/L.5, entitled \r\n“Permanent memorial to and remembrance of the \r\nvictims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade”, \r\nintroduced by the Caribbean Community, which we \r\nhave been co-sponsoring since 2007.\r\nThe Slave Route project of UNESCO has \r\ncontributed immensely to raising awareness of the \r\nhistory and consequences of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade and slavery. The recognition of 2015-2024 as the \r\nInternational Decade for People of African Descent \r\nprovides us the opportunity to showcase and recognize \r\nthe important contribution made by people of African \r\ndescent to modern societies. \r\nThe international community must utilize the \r\nopportunity in the implementation of Agenda 2030 to \r\nredouble its efforts and allocate more resources for the \r\npromotion and preservation of the dignity and worth \r\nof all human beings, especially vulnerable women and \r\ngirls, and the fight for the complete abolition of slavery \r\nin all its contemporary manifestations and forms as \r\nenvisioned in the Durban Declaration.\r\nMr. Amihai Bivas (Israel): I thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor convening this meeting. We also thank the delegation \r\nof Jamaica for its leadership on this issue, and we \r\nrecognize the many other Caribbean and African States \r\nthat have lent momentum to the drive to formally honour \r\nthe victims of slavery and the transatlantic trade.\r\nEarlier this year, on a cold, grey March day, the \r\nefforts of many Member States, organizations and \r\nindividuals came to fruition. With the unveiling of \r\nthe permanent memorial to the victims of slavery, \r\nthe Ark of Return, visitors and diplomats will now be \r\nstarkly reminded of the unnamed millions who endured \r\nunspeakable suffering, and those who perished. With \r\nthe completion of the memorial, one chapter of our \r\nwork has come to a close. And while we have good \r\nreason to be satisfied with this accomplishment — long \r\noverdue — we must now turn to the work ahead.\r\nAs draft resolution A/70/L.5 stresses, the \r\nresponsibility for educating about the causes, \r\nconsequences and lessons of slavery falls to us, as \r\nMember States and as individuals. In this regard, we \r\nsupport the efforts of the United Nations, including the \r\nactivities of the Department of Public Information, to \r\nteach these lessons across cultures and generations, \r\nand we encourage all Member States to do the same. \r\nIn adopting the draft resolution, Member States \r\nwill recognize the indomitable spirit of the millions \r\n4/17 15-34949\r\nA/70/PV.46 04/11/2015\r\nof slavery’s victims, and in their honour, pledge to \r\ncontinue to teach the lessons of the past.\r\nOne of the most important holidays on the Jewish \r\ncalendar is the observance of Passover. The holiday \r\nrecalls the 400 years of bitter slavery of the Jewish \r\npeople and celebrates the joy of freedom gained after \r\ngenerations in bondage. A key part of that holiday, \r\nalso known as the Feast of Freedom, is the relating of \r\nthis epic story to the next generation. In fact, the act of \r\ncarefully teaching it is so important that the Passover \r\nobservance has changed little for hundreds of years.\r\nI mention this because a crucial purpose of \r\nteaching and honouring the past is to inform how we \r\nact today and how we influence future generations. Our \r\nknowledge and understanding of past injustice should \r\ncompel us to act whenever it echoes in the present. We \r\nmust therefore recognize that the long arm of slavery \r\ncontinues to touch the modern world. Slavery’s legacy \r\nlives on in discrimination and inequality, racism \r\nand prejudice. The most fitting tribute we can pay to \r\nslavery’s victims is by addressing these issues and by \r\ncommitting ourselves to fighting modern-day slavery \r\nin all its forms. Wherever a child is forced into hard \r\nlabour, wherever a person is sold into prostitution, we \r\nmust put into action the responsibility that comes with \r\nmemory.\r\nIn conclusion, Israel is proud to have played its part \r\nin honouring the memory of the victims of slavery by \r\ncontributing to the Permanent Memorial Fund and by \r\nco-sponsoring the present draft resolution, as we have \r\ndone each year. We are grateful for this opportunity.\r\nMr. Kaganda (United Republic of Tanzania): My \r\ndelegation thanks you, Mr. President, for convening this \r\nimportant meeting to consider agenda item 118, entitled \r\n“Follow-up to the commemoration of the two-hundredth \r\nanniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade”. We thank and commend the Permanent Mission \r\nof Jamaica to the United Nations and members of the \r\nCaribbean Community for the facilitation of draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.5, to be adopted under this agenda \r\nitem, which Tanzania and other members of the Group \r\nof African States have naturally co-sponsored.\r\nWe wish to extend a word of appreciation to our \r\nillustrious Secretary-General for overseeing the \r\nimplementation of the resolutions adopted by this body \r\nunder this item, as illustrated in his recent reports \r\nbefore us.\r\nSlavery and the slave trade across the Atlantic, on \r\nthe shores of the Indian Ocean and elsewhere, were \r\na global tragedy whose legacy must be shared with \r\npresent and future generations with a view to preventing \r\nits recurrence in any shape or form. That is why my \r\ndelegation welcomes the eighth annual observance of \r\nthe International Day of Remembrance of the Victims \r\nof Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade under the \r\ntheme “Women and slavery”, which coincided with the \r\nunveiling of the permanent memorial the Ark of Return, \r\nin honour of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade.\r\nWe are delighted that the Ark has found a permanent \r\nand prominent berth at the United Nations Headquarters. \r\nWe hope and believe that the memorial will help \r\nvisitors, the general public, students, delegates, United \r\nNations staff, and other stakeholders to appreciate the \r\ntragedy and consider the legacy of slavery in general \r\nand the transatlantic slave trade in particular. Whereas \r\nthe memorial sufficiently presents a sombre portrayal \r\nof the tragedy, it would benefit a great deal from the \r\napplication of audio guide technology providing a \r\nrecorded spoken commentary to visitors.\r\nThe permanent memorial initiative is a great \r\nsuccess. As such, we would like to thank and commend \r\nthe Permanent Memorial Committee for its tireless \r\nefforts to ensure its successful completion. We also \r\nthank the Department of Public Information, the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nsixty-ninth session, and partners such as UNESCO for \r\nensuring the successful observance of the International \r\nDay. We acknowledge the significance of the United \r\nNations Trust Fund for Partnerships — Permanent \r\nMemorial, and thank all Member States, organizations \r\nand individuals that have generously contributed to it.\r\nModern forms of slavery persist in many parts \r\nof the world despite its abolition and classification \r\nas a crime against humanity. According to the \r\nInternational Labour Organization, around 21 million \r\nmen, women and children globally live in some form \r\nof slavery, generating a profit of around $150 billion \r\na year to unscrupulous operators and criminal gangs. \r\nDevastatingly, some of the victims of this vice are \r\ndescendants of persons who experienced the horrors \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade, and hence are reliving \r\na fraction of the dark history of the past. In that \r\nvein, resolution 61/19 could not be more accurate in \r\nrecognizing that the slave trade and slavery are at the \r\nheart of situations of profound social and economic \r\n15-34949 5/17\r\n04/11/2015 A/70/PV.46\r\ninequality, hatred, bigotry, racism and prejudice, which \r\naffects people of African descent today. Against this \r\nbackground, we would like to underscore the following.\r\nFirst, we recognize the importance of educating \r\nand informing current and future generations about the \r\ntragedy, lessons, history and consequences of slavery \r\nand the slave trade, which, as was once described in \r\nthis Hall, represents one of the low points in the history \r\nof humanity.\r\nSecondly, we recognize the importance of \r\nupholding human rights, especially pertaining to the \r\nequality and dignity of all humankind, without any \r\ndistinction. We note that the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights adopted by this body in 1948 declares \r\nthat no one shall be held in slavery or servitude and that \r\nslavery and the slave trade shall be prohibited in all their \r\nforms. We must enforce these rights, including through \r\nthe enactment of appropriate national legislation. We \r\nmust also put into effect the relevant provisions of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action, which \r\nis as relevant today as it was almost a decade and a half \r\nago.\r\nThirdly and finally, we recognize the importance of \r\neradicating poverty in all its forms and manifestations, \r\nand of addressing the chronic inequality that persists \r\namong and within countries and communities. We \r\nknow too well that poverty, protracted inequality, \r\nsocioeconomic and political exclusion, as well \r\nas conflicts, expose the vulnerable members of \r\nsociety — especially women, girls and boys — to a \r\nmyriad of misfortunes, including modern-day slavery, \r\nsexual violence and abuse. It is very opportune, \r\ntherefore, to address these challenges, including \r\nin the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and the African Union \r\nAgenda 2063, which we have recently adopted. We \r\nneed to forge greater partnerships to address the root \r\ncauses of these problems. Failure is not an option.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation would like to \r\npay a glowing tribute to the many enslaved women \r\nwho endured untold suffering and abuse from their \r\ntormentors, who advocated the abolition of slavery and \r\nthe slave trade, and who succeeded in transmitting the \r\nrich and vibrant African culture to their descendants. \r\nTheir incredible fortitude and steadfastness, which \r\nMs. Sylviane Diouf eloquently described in her keynote \r\naddress in March (see A/69/PV.83) and which actresses \r\nsuch as Lupita Nyong’o, Aunjanue Ellis and Oprah \r\nWinfrey magnificently depicted in their films Twelve \r\nYears a Slave, The Book of Negroes and Beloved, will \r\nnever be forgotten. We all have a duty to prevent the \r\nhorrors of yesteryear, and work towards building a \r\nprosperous future for all humankind, a future free from \r\nslavery in all its forms and manifestations. It can be \r\ndone. We must play our part.\r\nMr. Ruiz Blanco (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action \r\nrecognize that slavery and the transatlantic slave trade \r\nwere atrocious tragedies of human history, not only \r\nbecause of their abhorrent barbarism but because of \r\ntheir magnitude, their organized character and, in \r\nparticular, their denial of the essence of the victims. \r\nThe Declaration also recognizes that slavery and the \r\nslave trade, in particular the transatlantic slave trade, \r\nconstitute and should always have constituted a crime \r\nagainst humanity.\r\nIn the framework of this commemoration, Colombia \r\ncelebrates the imminent adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.5, on the permanent memorial recalling the \r\nvictims of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade, and \r\nis pleased to join the group of sponsors, as we have \r\ntraditionally done on this subject. We also celebrate the \r\nplacement of the Ark of Return on the grounds of the \r\nUnited Nations as a permanent memorial to the victims \r\nand a recognition of their tragedy, the legacy of their \r\nlives and, in many cases, their heroic resistance.\r\nThe communities of people of African descent now \r\nliving in all regions of the world have trod a long road \r\nto claim their rights and have raised their voices in our \r\nsocieties, generating awareness of human rights and \r\ncontributing invaluably to our cultures and identities \r\nas peoples and nations. In America, Colombia was \r\nparticularly enriched by the cultural contributions and \r\nlabour of the black people whom the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade brought to our lands. Cities such as Cartagena, \r\nPopayán and Santafé de Antioquia received this bitter \r\nlegacy. The millions of men and women brought from \r\nAfrica are embodied in our most important cultural \r\nmanifestations — our language, our cuisine, science \r\nand art. We also recall the contributions to freedom \r\nmade by the descendants of Bantus, Anzicos, Minas, \r\nViásfaras and Congos to American countries, in \r\nparticular Colombia, with the struggles waged by their \r\nautonomous communities of runaway slaves, including \r\ntheir own patriot armies.\r\nFor these reasons, there is a long cultural and \r\nlife-affirming bridge between our countries and African \r\ncountries that makes it unthinkable to discriminate \r\n6/17 15-34949\r\nA/70/PV.46 04/11/2015\r\nagainst them on the basis of their former enslavement. \r\nThe presence of cultures of African origin enriched \r\nour nationality and gave it a multicultural character \r\nof rich human content. Colombia is a multi-ethnic \r\ncountry, and our African origin is claimed as one of our \r\ngreatest assets. In this context, Colombia reiterates the \r\nimportance of resolution 69/16, which proclaimed the \r\n“International Decade for People of African Descent: \r\nrecognition, justice and development”. We believe \r\nthat this proclamation constitutes a great opportunity \r\nfor Governments, civil society and the international \r\ncommunity to pool their efforts in the common purpose \r\nto adopt effective public policies aimed at making a \r\ndifference over the next 10 years.\r\nThe International Decade for People of African \r\nDescent 2015-2024, proclaimed by the General \r\nAssembly and welcomed by the countries of Latin \r\nAmerica and the world, opens a window for redressing \r\nthe human catastrophe of the transatlantic slave trade, \r\nbased on the fact that it is not possible in any part of \r\nthe world to build a nation from the starting point of \r\nthe exclusion, invisibility and denial of the other, in \r\nparticular when that other gave his and her life to the \r\nmaterial and symbolic wealth of our countries and \r\nsocieties. The Decade seeks recognition on the part \r\nof the international community that people of African \r\ndescent represent a specific group whose human rights \r\nmust be promoted and protected. The communities of \r\npeople of African descent have the right to equality, \r\nnon-discrimination, education, ethno-education and \r\nparticipation and inclusion in society.\r\nIn Colombia, the Decade was launched on 21 May \r\nthrough a national campaign entitled “La hora contra el \r\nracismo”. A few months later, a national development \r\nplan enshrined in law the commitment of the Colombian \r\nState to the Decade through measures such as a 10-year \r\nplan for the Afro-Colombian population, a special \r\nstatute for the Raizals — the black communities of \r\nSan Andrés, one of our island communities in the \r\nCaribbean — and compensation for the property \r\ntax imposed on the collective territories of the black \r\ncommunities.\r\nRecognition of multicultural and plural ethnicity \r\nby my country’s political Constitution launched \r\na fruitful way for Colombia to be recognized as a \r\ncountry of immense cultural wealth based on the \r\ndifferences and autonomy of its various population \r\ngroups. These principles have allowed the country to \r\ndeepen its understanding of its own history and that \r\nof its populations. The socialization of that history is \r\none of the most important strategies for the eradication \r\nof racial discrimination, insofar as it allows us to \r\nhighlight the role of each of these communities in the \r\ndevelopment of the country and the nation.\r\nToday, as we join in the commemoration of the \r\n200th year since the abolition of the transatlantic \r\nslave trade, we recall the victims and the immense \r\nand invaluable contribution they made to each of our \r\nnations. Once again, we join voices to ensure that this \r\nshameful episode in the history of humankind is never \r\nrepeated.\r\nMs. Butts (United States of America): I am \r\nhonoured to represent the United States today on this \r\nimportant occasion to recognize the commemoration \r\nof the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade. \r\nTwo hundred and seven years ago, on 1 January \r\n1808 in New York City, a young Peter Williams Junior, \r\na self-described descendant of Africa who would \r\nbecome a leading pastor and noted abolitionist, chose to \r\nrecognize the effective date of the legislation abolishing \r\nthe transatlantic slave trade in a speech entitled “An \r\nOration on the Abolition of the Slave Trade”. He exalted \r\nin the moment: \r\n“Rejoice, Oh, ye descendants of Africans! \r\nNo longer shall the United States of America, nor \r\nthe extensive colonies of Great Britain, admit the \r\ndegrading commerce of the human species: no \r\nlonger shall they swell the tide of African misery \r\nby the importation of slaves. Rejoice, my brethren, \r\nthat the channels are obstructed through which \r\nslavery, and its direful concomitants, have been \r\nentailed on the African race.” \r\nToday we, too, rejoice in the United Nations \r\nrecognition of the bitter history of the transatlantic \r\nslave trade through the permanent memorial the Ark \r\nof Return unveiled this past March. The United States \r\nis pleased to join more than 90 Member States that \r\nhave made contributions in support of the permanent \r\nmemorial — designed by an American architect of \r\nHaitian descent, Rodney Leon — that now stands on \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters grounds as a public \r\ntribute to all of slavery’s victims. The United States \r\ncontribution supports this crucial project in partnership \r\nwith so many others who came together to fight injustice \r\nwith the particular leadership of Member States, the \r\n15-34949 7/17\r\n04/11/2015 A/70/PV.46\r\nMission of Jamaica, the Caribbean Community and the \r\nAfrican Union. \r\nAs a multicultural society, the United States \r\nstrongly believes in spreading awareness of the struggle \r\nof all who fell victim to slavery. While we take pride \r\nin the tremendous progress we have made in our great \r\nnation, led by such historic women leaders as Harriet \r\nTubman, Sojourner Truth, Fannie Lou Hamer and Ella \r\nBaker, we also recognize that the scars of the past still \r\nlinger. As such, we are dedicated to educating future \r\ngenerations of this tragic past as a means of combating \r\nracism and prejudice.\r\nThe United States continues to press forward on \r\neliminating discrimination within our country as well \r\nas joining the global community in creating a world of \r\nfreedom and equality for all. In that vein, the United \r\nStates is proud to be a sponsor of this draft resolution \r\nand to support the ongoing efforts of the United Nations \r\nto fight racial injustice and intolerance. Also, we are \r\nproud of the fact that more than 120 United States mayors \r\nhave joined the International Coalition of Cities against \r\nRacism, an initiative launched by the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The \r\nUnited States network has been the fastest-growing \r\npart of the global coalition. Every day United Nations \r\nrepresentatives and Government officials, along with \r\ntour groups, visitors and schoolchildren, will experience \r\nthe Ark of Return. \r\nThe memorial stands as a reminder not only of the \r\nhorrific injustices of the past but also of our shared \r\nresponsibility to fully realize the aspirations outlined in \r\nthe United Nations Charter. We must continue to study \r\nthe history and legacy of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. We must never forget the terrible human \r\ntragedy and the moral courage of those who work to \r\nend it.\r\nMr. Rakhmetullin (Kazakhstan): Every year, on \r\n25 March, we pay tribute to the victims of slavery. The \r\nInternational Day of Remembrance of the Victims of \r\nSlavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade is also a sober \r\nreminder that many modern forms of slavery and long-\r\nestablished stereotypes and biases continue to prevail, \r\nall calling for strong, concerted multilateral action.\r\nSlavery did not end with its abolition in the \r\nnineteenth century. It continues to prevail in numerous \r\nways, in some form or another, in almost every country \r\nin the world. This illegal practice takes the form of \r\nwomen caught in prostitution, children and adults \r\nforced to work in agriculture, domestic work, factories \r\nand sweatshops. Unfortunately, the illegal practice of \r\nslavery still blights the contemporary world. According \r\nto the International Labour Organization, around \r\n21 million men, women and children throughout the \r\nworld are in a form of slavery. Contemporary slavery \r\ntakes various forms and affects people of all ages, \r\ngender and races, restricting their freedom.\r\nWhat we learned from past tragic experiences in \r\nour part of the world is best summarized in the words of \r\nPresident Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan, while \r\ninaugurating in 2002 the monument dedicated to the \r\nvictims of political repression. He said “We remember \r\nnot to sprinkle ashes on our heads, but to prevent such \r\ntragedies in the present and in the future”. We should \r\nremember historical tragedies each day of our lives \r\nin every thought, word and deed, and not merely at \r\ncommemorative observances.\r\nMy country, in its national legislation, condemns \r\nand forbids genocide, racial segregation and all forms of \r\nracial discrimination, propaganda and agitation for racial, \r\nnational and religious superiority. Kazakhstan supports \r\nthe creation of inclusive multiracial and multi-ethnic \r\norganizations and movements. The country, where about \r\n130 ethnic groups and 20 religious denominations live \r\npeacefully, has a unique constitutional organ to ensure \r\ninter-ethnic harmony — the Assembly of the People of \r\nKazakhstan — the public entity that has nine seats in \r\nthe Parliament. In Astana, we organize regularly the \r\ntriennial Congress of Leaders of World and Traditional \r\nReligions as a platform for dialogue among spiritual \r\nleaders to promote mutual respect and understanding \r\nworldwide, thus contributing to peace and security.\r\nMy country considers the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade to be one of the most tragic pages of human \r\nhistory — one that still has lasting consequences, \r\nseverely damaging human rights and international \r\nlaw. The erosion of international law demands from \r\nus all a reaffirmation of its cornerstone principles and \r\nour commitment to preserve them to overcome the \r\nchallenges ahead. At the general debate of this session, \r\nthe President of Kazakhstan proposed convening in \r\n2016 a United Nations international conference at the \r\nhighest level, designed to reaffirm the basic principles \r\nof international law (see A/70/PV.13).\r\nKazakhstan has co-sponsored draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.5, entitled “Permanent memorial to and \r\nremembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade” to reconfirm my country’s \r\n8/17 15-34949\r\nA/70/PV.46 04/11/2015\r\nrobust commitment to combating racial and ethnic \r\ndiscrimination and to upholding human dignity, \r\nfreedom and justice for all — the primary prerequisites \r\nfor peace and security.\r\nMr. León González (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba attaches special importance to the commemoration \r\nof the bicentenary of the abolition of the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. Cuba is proud to sponsor draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.5, before us today. \r\nWe reaffirm the special declaration of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(CELAC) in favour of erecting a permanent memorial \r\nin honour of the victims of slavery and the transatlantic \r\nslave trade. We also support the CELAC Latin American \r\nand Caribbean People of African Descent Action Plan, \r\nadopted in the context of its third Summit in January \r\n2015, held in Costa Rica. Cuba welcomes both the \r\nproclamation of the International Decade for People of \r\nAfrican Descent and the approval of the programme of \r\nactivities for the Decade, and reiterates its commitment \r\nto continuing to participate actively and support efforts \r\nfor its effective implementation.\r\nIn Cuba, as in other countries in Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean, we can feel the consequences of \r\nthe transatlantic slave trade. That cruel trade brought \r\napproximately 1,300,000 Africans to our island. These \r\nmen, women and children from Africa were torn from \r\ntheir villages and families and sold as slaves on the \r\nother side of the Atlantic. The identity of the Cuban \r\nnation emerged from the mixing of the cultures of \r\nvarious ethnic groups in difficult colonial and, later, \r\nneocolonial circumstances.\r\nIn 1959, we launched a stage of true integration \r\nand recognized the value of all components of Cuban \r\nculture. We are essentially a mixture of Hispanics and \r\nAfricans; we also have influences from Asia and the \r\nAmerican indigenous peoples. The Cuban people are \r\nvery proud of their African origins, which are embodied \r\nin our idiosyncrasies and cultural characteristics. Cuban \r\nculture and nationality are enriched by the legacy of the \r\nAfricans. Freed slaves and their descendants were the \r\nmain actors in the various stages of the war that enabled \r\nthe Cuban people to exercise its self-determination. \r\nFurthermore, Cuba has contributed its own blood to \r\nthe emancipation of Africa, a continent to which all \r\nhumankind will forever be in debt.\r\nAs stated by the historic leader of the Cuban \r\nrevolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, in his statement at \r\nthe World Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \r\nheld in Durban in 2001: \r\n“The inhuman exploitation imposed on the \r\npeoples of three continents, including Asia, marked \r\nforever the destiny and lives of over 4.5 billion \r\npeople living in the Third World today whose \r\npoverty, unemployment, illiteracy and health rates \r\nas well as their infant mortality, life expectancy and \r\nother calamities — too many, in fact, to enumerate \r\nhere — are certainly awesome and harrowing. \r\nThey are the current victims of that atrocity, \r\nwhich lasted centuries, and those who clearly \r\ndeserve compensation for the horrendous crimes \r\nperpetrated against their ancestors and peoples.”\r\nThe developed countries and their consumer \r\nsocieties, responsible for the accelerated and almost \r\nunstoppable destruction of the environment, have \r\nbeen the main beneficiaries of conquest, colonization, \r\nslavery and the transatlantic slave trade, and the \r\nterrible exploitation and extermination of hundreds \r\nof people of the South. Cuba supports the just request \r\nfor compensation put forward by the countries of the \r\nCaribbean Community. Cuba also advocates the special \r\nand differentiated treatment requested by the developing \r\ncountries, in particular in Africa, in their economic and \r\ninternational relations. Cuba rejects selfishness and the \r\nshameful wealth of a few that serve as the blueprint for \r\nthe ongoing globalization.\r\nMr. Zinsou (Benin), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nTo conclude, we reaffirm the importance of \r\nstrengthening the activities of the United Nations and \r\nother international organizations, such as UNESCO, \r\nwith regard to this issue. It is the minimum that the \r\ninternational community can do to repair the crime \r\nagainst humanity committed through slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade of Africans.\r\nMr. Minah (Sierra Leone): I am truly honoured to \r\nrepresent Sierra Leone at this moment as we celebrate \r\nthe 200th anniversary of the abolition of the slave \r\ntrade. We are truly grateful for the leadership provided \r\nby Jamaica, and we commend Ambassador Rattray for \r\nhis leadership of a memorial committee that led to the \r\ncreation and the establishment of the Ark of Return \r\ndesigned by a Haitian American architect, Rodney \r\nLeon, and supervised by Sierra Leonean engineer \r\nMelbourne Garber.\r\n15-34949 9/17\r\n04/11/2015 A/70/PV.46\r\nAs we commemorate the lives lost, let us celebrate \r\nthe resilience of the descendants. As we commemorate \r\nthe lives lost, let us also educate those who need to \r\nknow the lessons of the slave trade. Certain names ring \r\ntrue when we talk about the transatlantic slave trade, \r\nbut all of us might not be familiar with them. Names \r\nsuch as Elmina, Cape Coast, Gorée Island and Bunce \r\nIsland are all locations where the commercialization of \r\nthe slave trade occurred on the West African coast.\r\nAll delegations support the total abolition of the \r\nslave trade, but let us understand that while the tide of \r\nslavery has receded, it has not completely gone away. We \r\nmust remain vigilant. We must remain attentive to make \r\nsure that a world without prejudice, without bigotry, \r\nwithout discrimination and without slavery truly comes \r\nabout. We note the terms, the clauses and the promise \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. We also \r\ntake note of the aspirations of this noble Organization, \r\nbut the future is not guaranteed and it is for all of us \r\nas diplomats, as those who are influence-makers and \r\nopinion formers, to make sure we remain vigilant on \r\nthe question of slavery in all its forms to ensure that \r\nthe world we wish to live in, and the world we wish to \r\nbequeath to generations yet unborn, is truly free, fair \r\nand as we wish it to be.\r\nIn a village in Cuba I had the privilege of meeting \r\ndescendants of slavery who still sing the songs of a \r\nWest African village in Freetown, Sierra Leone. A film \r\ncrew managed to record these songs in Cuba and also \r\nto go to West Africa to try to find the origins of these \r\nsongs. When he played the songs in Sierra Leone in \r\nthis particular village, these songs were immediately \r\nrecognized by the old people who said: “Those are our \r\nsongs. Those are the songs our grandmothers used to \r\nsing to us. We recognize these songs.” The result of \r\nthis discovery was that members of the Cuban village \r\nwent to Sierra Leone and met those in the Sierra \r\nLeonean village and even though they were separated \r\nby language, the one phrase that both of them could \r\nmanage to understand among themselves was simply \r\nthe phrase “they are we”. In other words these are our \r\npeople, our cousins, our sisters, our descendants.\r\nSlavery has united many in misery, but the promise \r\nof the future is for us to realize that the resilience of \r\nthe descendants can make a future for the world we \r\nwish to live in. As we celebrate and commemorate, \r\nlet us rededicate ourselves to what we need to do. We \r\nwelcome the leadership of Jamaica, but it is for all of us \r\nto do our part to make sure that the world we wish to \r\nlive in truly comes about.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on agenda item 118.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/70/L.5, entitled “Permanent memorial \r\nto and remembrance of the victims of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Zhang Saijin (Department for General \r\nAssembly and Conference Management): I should like \r\nto announce that, since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution, in addition to those delegations listed in \r\ndocument A/70/L.5, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of the draft resolution: Andorra, \r\nArgentina, the Plurinational State of Bolivia, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, \r\nthe Czech Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Georgia, \r\nHonduras, Iceland, Indonesia, Japan, Kazakhstan, \r\nLiechtenstein, Malaysia, Maldives, Monaco, Mongolia, \r\nMontenegro, Nepal, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Norway, \r\nParaguay, Peru, Samoa, San Marino, Serbia, Sweden, \r\nThailand, Timor-Leste, Turkey, Uruguay, the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela and Viet Nam.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly adopted a similar draft resolution \r\nat the previous session without a vote. May I take it \r\nthat the Assembly decides to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/70/L.5 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/70/L.5 was adopted (resolution \r\n70/7).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I shall \r\nnow give the f loor to the speaker who wishes to speak \r\nin explanation of position on the resolution just adopted.\r\nI give the f loor to the observer of the European \r\nUnion.\r\nMr. Whiteley (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union.\r\nSlavery and the slave trade are a crime against \r\nhumanity and should always have been so, especially \r\nthe transatlantic slave trade, and are among the \r\nmajor sources and manifestations of racism, racial \r\ndiscrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance.\r\n10/17 15-34949\r\nA/70/PV.46 04/11/2015\r\nBuilding on that notion, acknowledged at the World \r\nConference against Racism in 2001, in 2007 the General \r\nAssembly agreed to establish a permanent memorial on \r\nthe grounds of the United Nations to honour the victims \r\nof slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. Working \r\ntogether in unity, on the one hand to honour the victims \r\nof slavery but also to acknowledge and remember such \r\nmanifestations of racial discrimination, it was with \r\ngreat contentment that in March we witnessed the \r\nunveiling of the memorial the Ark of Return.\r\nWe warmly acknowledge the work of the Committee \r\nof interested States, pay tribute to the efforts of Jamaica, \r\nthe Caribbean Community and African Union States \r\nand others, and the generous voluntary contributions \r\nfrom Member States, complemented by funding from \r\nfoundations and private individuals.\r\nThe memorial reminds us, and will continue to \r\nremind those after us, of the tragic legacy of the slave \r\ntrade and the need to continue the fight against racism and \r\nprejudice. We believe that the project is just beginning. \r\nThe memorial helps us to remember the past and what \r\nracism and prejudice brings. We must work together in \r\nraising awareness of, educating and informing current \r\nand future generations about the causes, consequences \r\nand lessons of slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. \r\nNo effort should be spared, and the European Union \r\nwill always be in the forefront of efforts to combat all \r\nforms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 118.\r\nAgenda items 119 and 120 (continued)\r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nMr. De Antueno (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, we would like to thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for convening the Assembly to \r\nexchange ideas with regard to the implementation of the \r\nresolutions of the United Nations and the revitalization \r\nof the work of the General Assembly.\r\nThe General Assembly is the most representative \r\nand democratic organ of the Organization. Our \r\ndelegation is convinced that we must work seriously to \r\nrecover the leading role that, for different reasons, very \r\noften has been ceded to or taken up by other bodies. \r\nTherefore, we recall the fundamental importance of \r\npromoting the efficiency, transparency and inclusivity \r\nof our work as basic pillars to improve and perfect \r\nthe working methods of the Assembly and each of its \r\ncommittees.\r\nIn that regard, the work done and efforts made \r\nare worthy of recognition. The process headed by \r\nAmbassador Vladimir Drobnjak and Wilfried Emvula \r\nhave to be highlighted; they led to the adoption of \r\nresolution 69/321, which is innovative in many respects, \r\nin particular with regard to the process of the selection \r\nand appointment of the Secretary-General. We are \r\ngrateful to the entire membership for the f lexibility and \r\nconstructive spirit demonstrated during the process, \r\nwhich must continue during this session.\r\nOne question that we think is important to reflect \r\non for the future is the need to strengthen the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly. We must \r\nguarantee that the exception is not the rule. Both \r\nfrom a personnel perspective and from the budgetary \r\npoint of view, the Office of the President has to have \r\nthe necessary resources to function appropriately and \r\npredictably. It is clear that the resources currently \r\nallocated from the regular budget are insufficient and \r\nhave not been substantially increased since 1998, when \r\nthey were established. On the other hand, the trust \r\nfund established in 2010 is not the most efficient or \r\ntransparent way to finance the Office.\r\nIt is essential to establish mechanisms that \r\nguarantee total accountability with regard to the \r\nresources available for the trust fund, as well as the \r\norigin and way in which they are used. We must reflect \r\ncollectively with regard to the best way to guarantee \r\nthat the Office of the President adjusts to the highest \r\nstandards of transparency. In previous years we have \r\ndiscussed these issues in the framework of the debates \r\non the revitalization of the General Assembly. We \r\ncannot continue delaying a solution to these problems. \r\nThe time for action is now.\r\nAnother point I wish to make is the need to respect \r\nthe equilibrium in geographic representation as well \r\nas gender equality for the posts of the Organization. \r\nThat leads us to underscore the appeal to invite women \r\ncandidates for the highest post, which is to be filled \r\nnext year. After eight Secretaries-General and seven \r\ndecades when the administration of the Organization \r\nwas headed by men, and with everything that the United \r\nNations is doing for the empowerment of women, the \r\n15-34949 11/17\r\n04/11/2015 A/70/PV.46\r\ntime has come to continue to make history and ensure \r\nthat a woman heads up that important post.\r\nAnother aspect of concern is the timeliness and the \r\nupdating of the reports we receive. Argentina reiterates \r\nthe need to implement the provisions of resolution \r\n46/190, which establishes that documents must be \r\nsubmitted by the Secretariat six weeks in advance, and \r\nin the six official languages of the United Nations.\r\nFinally, in relation to the implementation \r\nresolutions, we ask the membership to make the \r\npolitical commitment to carry them out as a legal \r\nobligation. That is one of the most serious problems \r\nfaced by the General Assembly, and one reason that it \r\nhas lost in its leadership. But the deep analysis, hours of \r\ndebate and the commitments and negotiations will all \r\nbe for naught if States Members ignore the resolutions \r\nthat are adopted and we do not comply and keep our \r\nword in the most inclusive and democratic organ at our \r\ndisposal. We thus cannot complaint that other organs \r\nare encroaching on our functions and leaving us out of \r\nthe discussions.\r\nMs. Argüello González (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We are grateful for the convening of this \r\nimportant meeting. First and foremost, our delegation \r\nwishes to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Wilfried \r\nEmvula, Permanent Representative of Namibia, and \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Vladimir Drobnjak, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Croatia, on their reappointments \r\nas co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly. \r\nWe wish them every success in the performance of their \r\nfunctions.\r\nOur delegation associates itself with the statement \r\nmade by the representative of Algeria on behalf of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries (see A/70/PV.45).\r\nOur delegation reiterates its firm commitment to \r\nthe process of the revitalization and democratization \r\nof the General Assembly. We want to continue to \r\nwork constructively so that this organ can act in all its \r\ndimensions as the most representative and legitimate \r\norgan of the Organization.\r\nAs established on different occasions, Nicaragua \r\nbelieves the democratization of the United Nations \r\nto be an overriding concern. To achieve that goal, we \r\nmust continue to take measures so that the authority \r\nof the General Assembly is restored in order for \r\nit to act as the most democratic, deliberative and \r\nnormative organ of the Organization. We therefore \r\nhighlight the importance of the full implementation of \r\nresolution 69/321, adopted by the General Assembly on \r\n11 September 2015 and entitled “Revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly”. We recall the f lexible \r\napproach and consensual adoption of the resolution. We \r\nalso agreed to continue the review of the four clusters, \r\namong which is the nomination and appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General during this seventieth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe resolution marks a milestone in the following: \r\nthrough a letter from the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the President of the Security Council, \r\nthe resolution invites applications for the post of \r\nSecretary-General and requests that the names of the \r\ncandidates be circulated to the membership in general, \r\nthat meetings with the Member States be held and that \r\nthere be women candidates.\r\nThe Working Group is at an auspicious crossroads in \r\nterms of revitalizing the General Assembly. Nicaragua \r\nreaffirms its vision to make the United Nations and \r\nthe General Assembly the principal global forum for \r\ndebate. The Assembly must be a genuine bridge of \r\ncommunication with global governance stakeholders. \r\nAs such, it is necessary for it to be a transparent and \r\ninclusive forum, where each country, however small, \r\ncan feel that its voice is heard.\r\nWe already have at our disposal the necessary tools \r\nby way of the provisions of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the resolutions of the General Assembly. \r\nThe division of labour is clearly defined among the \r\ndifferent organs. We must respect and ensure that the \r\nSecurity Council does not take up subjects that are \r\nwithin the competence of the General Assembly.\r\nThe seventieth anniversary of the United Nations is \r\na crucial time, which is vital because of its importance \r\nto international law, global security and peace. We \r\nhope that this historic time will be taken full advantage \r\nof to create awareness of the role and activities of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn no way can we minimize the achievements and \r\nimportance of the General Assembly. The decrease in \r\nits role and functioning could cause doubts as to its \r\nrelevance and credibility. The voice and the vote of \r\nall States Members of the Organization for the good \r\nof all our peoples must be increasingly strengthened. \r\nNicaragua is committed to every initiative that allows \r\nus to recreate, reinvent and reshape the United Nations. \r\nWe are in favour of reshaping the United Nations so \r\n12/17 15-34949\r\nA/70/PV.46 04/11/2015\r\nthat the interests of everyone prevail and we can speak \r\nand hear under equal conditions as Member States.\r\nWe conclude with the inspiring words of our \r\nPresident, Commander Ortega Saavedra. May the \r\nUnited Nations lead us to play our role of ensuring \r\ndialogue, respect, understanding, security with \r\nsovereignty, peace and a future without interference or \r\ndependency, but working on a footing of equality, that \r\nis, with all, for all, for the good of all. May that be so.\r\nMr. Mendoza-García (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Costa Rica associates itself with the statement \r\n(see A/70/PV.45) made by the representative of Estonia \r\non behalf of the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency group (ACT), with whom we co-chair the \r\nACT working group on transparency.\r\nMy delegation is grateful for the convening of this \r\njoint debate on agenda items 119 and 120, as well as \r\nfor the appointment of the Ambassadors of Croatia and \r\nNamibia as co-facilitators for this session of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We recognize their excellent work \r\nat the previous session, which we are convinced will \r\nfacilitate significant progress at the present session.\r\nAllow me, in my national capacity, to make the \r\nfollowing points with regard to the process of the \r\nselection and the appointment of the person who will \r\noccupy the post of Secretary-General as of 2017.\r\nFirst I should like to highlight that it is with a \r\nfeeling of urgency that we have to follow up resolution \r\n69/321 and all the relevant resolutions on the process \r\nof the selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Although adopted, those resolutions have not \r\nbeen implemented fully or have to be modified because, \r\nuntil just a few months ago, there was no clear, defined \r\nprocess for such appointment.\r\nAs with all processes, implementation is decisive. \r\nResolution 69/321 includes clear and forceful language \r\nas to how the membership considers that the process \r\nshould be carried out for the selection of the next person \r\nwho will become Secretary-General. Costa Rica hopes \r\nthat the next Secretary-General will be a woman.\r\nIn that connection, Costa Rica calls upon the \r\nPresidents of the Security Council and of the General \r\nAssembly to remit a joint note to the membership as \r\nsoon as possible officially inviting the submission of \r\nnominations, as established clearly in the resolution. \r\nThat letter should also invite Member States to put \r\nforward women for the post of Secretary-General; \r\nthereby an open, transparent and inclusive process will \r\nbe launched.\r\nOnce the process is formally begun, we will have \r\nan opportunity to know on a regular basis the names \r\nof the candidates and their curricula vitae, as well as \r\nthe possibility of interacting with them in informal \r\nmeetings of the General Assembly or in formats that \r\ninclude meetings with regional groups — or even under \r\nan Arria-Formula format. We want to, and should, know \r\ntheir visions and platforms for action. This upcoming \r\nappointment will be decisive for the Organization.\r\nFurthermore, Costa Rica supports the idea that \r\nthe Security Council must recommend more than one \r\ncandidate to the General Assembly. We are happy to \r\nknow that a permanent member of the Security Council \r\nhas expressed its support for that option.\r\nSince nobody questions the legitimacy and the \r\nmandate of the President in any of our countries that are \r\ndemocratically elected, we should not fear that a process \r\nof this nature will in any way affect their mandate. A \r\nvote serves to confer greater legitimacy on the selection. \r\nEven when we consider the many achievements of past \r\nsessions, with the onset of the next session Costa Rica \r\nwill continue to promote changing the mandate to a \r\nsingle, non-renewable term of seven years, which will \r\nthus guarantee the independence of the post.\r\nIt is necessary that the next person who becomes \r\nSecretary-General perform with moral authority, \r\nintegrity and courage, so that the United Nations can \r\ndo its work in a more effective way. We need a strong \r\nand impartial leader, one who will not be involved in \r\ncampaigns or making undue promises to assure his \r\nreappointment. On the contrary, the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral must focus on current concerns that demand \r\nour maximum attention and clear action. All members \r\nrepresented in the General Assembly, not just the 15 \r\nmembers of the Security Council, must be involved in \r\nthe process of selection. The General Assembly must \r\nplay a more active and vigorous role, as should be the \r\ncase in any democratic system.\r\nNot only do we wish to have a voice in the process, \r\nwe want to participate in it. Costa Rica aspires to an \r\nopen, transparent election based on merit, with a \r\nfeeling of predictability, and which is taking place in a \r\nstructured and timely fashion.\r\nWith regard to the strengthening of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, we are convinced \r\n15-34949 13/17\r\n04/11/2015 A/70/PV.46\r\nthat we must make a very serious analysis of how we \r\ncan ensure transparency and improve the effectiveness \r\nof its management. We think the Office should have a \r\nminimum number of resources from the regular budget \r\nthat corresponds to the mandate we have given to it as \r\nthe General Assembly and which will allow it to act \r\nwithout any level of financial dependency with regard \r\nto a specific country or donor.\r\nThe fact that the Office has not received an \r\nincrease in its budget for 20 years shows the little \r\nstrategic thinking we have devoted to its functions, \r\ncompetencies and necessary resources to do its work. \r\nWe must therefore carry out a debate on the scope \r\nof its powers and the level of activities that Member \r\nStates expect from the Office, with a view to finding \r\na way of strengthening the institution. In that respect, \r\nthe discussion on the biennial budget is an opportunity \r\nthat we cannot miss, as it will allow us to take concrete \r\naction to correct past deficiencies.\r\nWe think that the time for major change in the \r\nUnited Nations has come. We must start without delay. \r\nWe have all the necessary tools at our disposal. Let us \r\nuse them. The time is now.\r\nMrs. Zarrouk Boumiza (Tunisia) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation would like to thank the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia for \r\ntheir great efforts as co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly during the seventieth session. We welcome \r\nthem both and congratulate them on their re-election \r\nas co-Chairs.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statement (see \r\nA/70/PV.45) made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries. \r\nI would like to make the following comments in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nThe Working Group will continue its work \r\nthroughout this session on the four topics it was already \r\nconsidering. Our great interest and priority continues \r\nto be on the selection and appointment of the next \r\nSecretary-General, which will take place in 2016.\r\nWith regard to strengthening of the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and its delegations, we believe that \r\nto be among the main priorities in the overall reform of \r\nthe United Nations, given the Assembly’s role as a key \r\ndeliberating body and one that defines overall policies. \r\nIt is the most representative organ of the United Nations. \r\nIt also has a key role to play in the establishment of the \r\nnorms and codification of international law, as well as in \r\nquestions related to the budget and the administration. \r\nAt the same time, we must strengthen the role of this \r\nbody and its authority and move forward to revitalize \r\nits work. In the same context, we must pursue the \r\nimplementation of the relevant resolutions, including \r\non the selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, as that is essential for progress to be made in \r\nthis area.\r\nMy delegation believes that strengthening the \r\nrole and authority of the General Assembly requires \r\npursuing and including in its agenda urgent issues \r\nthat are relevant to the international community. It is \r\nnecessary for this body to be able to address current \r\nchallenges, including making progress on implementing \r\nour obligations under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) and strengthening our \r\nefforts to combat terrorism.\r\nWe believe the holding of thematic debates to be an \r\nimportant interactive tool that enables us to exchange \r\npoints of view on topics of common interest that are of \r\ncurrent relevance. We hope that such discussions will \r\ncontinue under the presidency of the seventieth session \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nOn another point, we reaffirm the importance of \r\nimproving the content of the annual Security Council \r\nreports submitted to the General Assembly so that they \r\nare more thorough and more analytical and reflect the \r\ncontexts in which resolutions were adopted and the \r\nissues that remain unresolved.\r\nWe would also like to underscore the importance \r\nof holding regular meetings among the heads of \r\nthe various entities within the United Nations and \r\nregularly informing Member States of the results. That \r\nis a matter of increasing coordination and cooperation \r\namong the essential bodies. We favour expanding such \r\ncoordination so that it encompasses all the agendas of \r\nthose bodies, in order to strengthen integration and \r\nmainstreaming.\r\nWith regard to the work of the General Assembly, \r\nmy delegation notes that we have already taken many \r\nmeasures to improve the methods of work of the Main \r\nCommittees of the General Assembly. However, we need \r\nto go into the substance of the discussions of certain \r\nrecommendations that are related to this as follows: to \r\nattempt to summarize and be brief in resolutions and \r\nreports and other United Nations documents and to \r\nfocus on the practical aspects and avoid redundancy; to \r\n14/17 15-34949\r\nA/70/PV.46 04/11/2015\r\nexchange best practices among the various committees \r\nwhile maintaining the specificity of each committee \r\nand the distribution of responsibilities among them; \r\nto avoid the dates of meetings of various committees \r\ninterfering with one another; and that discussions are \r\nwell planned.\r\nAs to the nomination of the Secretary-General \r\nthat will take place next year, my country takes a \r\nfavourable view of the consensus reached during the \r\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly to send a \r\njoint letter of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil to invite delegations to present the names of \r\ntheir candidates, to make the whole process clearer \r\nand to regularly circulate the names and curricula \r\nvitae of the candidates. We hope that there will be \r\nclose collaboration with the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the President of the Security Council to \r\nofficially begin that process as soon as possible.\r\nWe underscore the importance of the full \r\nimplementation of the Assembly’s resolutions, including \r\nresolution 69/321, on the role of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich should be transparent, exhaustive and guarantee \r\nthe participation of all Member States in the various \r\nstages. We are certain that there are a number of very \r\nqualified candidates to take up the post of Secretary-\r\nGeneral. And it is important to include names of women \r\non the list of candidates, especially since no woman has \r\nbeen appointed to the post since the establishment of \r\nthe Organization, 70 years ago.\r\nWith regard to the strengthening the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, we believe that it is \r\nnecessary to provide all the necessary human resources \r\nand financial support to the President so that he can \r\ncarry out his mandate effectively and so that taking up \r\nthe presidency does not pose an additional burden for \r\ncountries with limited resources. We also underscore \r\nthe importance of strengthening the institutional \r\nmemory of the Office of the President of the General \r\nAssembly and to transmit the lessons learned and best \r\npractices from one President to another. That could \r\nguarantee effectiveness in managing the presidency.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate our support \r\nfor resolution 69/321, which was adopted in September \r\nand which re-establishes the Ad Hoc Working Group on \r\nthe Revitalization of the Work of the General Assembly. \r\nWe hope that its agenda will be very precise.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to congratulate \r\nMr. Vladimir Drobnjak and Mr. Wilfried Emvula, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia, \r\nrespectively, on their reappointment as co-Chairs of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe Work of the General Assembly during its seventieth \r\nsession. We commend their enormous, constructive and \r\ntireless efforts during the negotiations. We assure them \r\nof our full cooperation.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\n(see A/70/PV.45) made on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nThe process of revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly is part of the major efforts to reform \r\nthe United Nations and constitutes a driving force, as \r\nit has done from the beginning. Facing new types of \r\nproblems and challenges, the roles of the United Nations \r\nhave increased and diversified, requiring new ways of \r\nworking and also new sources of financing.\r\nDuring the general debate in September, world \r\nleaders mainly focused on the reform of the United \r\nNations so that the Organization can be capable of \r\neffectively carrying out its mandate while reflecting \r\nthe geopolitical realities of today’s world, strengthening \r\ninternational peace and security, combating the \r\nphenomenon of terrorism, strengthening the means \r\nof prevention and combating the recurrence of crises \r\nand conflicts, and preventing the deterioration of our \r\nenvironment and our biodiversity. The achievement of \r\nthose goals will certainly enable us to make the main \r\ndeliberative body a strong, credible and effective body \r\nthat is capable of addressing the new challenges of the \r\ntwenty-first century and of contributing to building a \r\nbetter world, one that is peaceful, more prosperous and \r\nmore just.\r\nResolution 69/321, adopted by the General \r\nAssembly on 11 September, is a major step forward \r\ndue to the spirit of compromise and f lexibility that \r\ndelegations demonstrated throughout the negotiations. \r\nIt is certainly possible to make tangible progress in the \r\nprocess of the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly — specifically as far as its methods of work \r\nare concerned — and that requires of the Chairs and \r\nmembers of the bureaux of the Main Committees \r\nto take better account in their consultations with \r\nMember States so that they can improve the work of \r\nthe Committees. We call on the Secretary-General and \r\non Chairs of the Main Committees to better coordinate \r\ntheir work in order to optimize the interactive nature \r\nof their relationship. We recall the decision to proceed \r\n15-34949 15/17\r\n04/11/2015 A/70/PV.46\r\nto the election of the non-permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council and the members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council six months before they assume their \r\nfunctions, including during the seventieth session.\r\nBeyond working methods, we would also like \r\nto recall that the subject that has gained the most \r\ninterest this year is mainly the process of the selection \r\nof the Secretary-General, which introduced major \r\ninnovations in the selection procedures. My delegation \r\nalso welcomes and strongly supports the measure \r\nof the relevant resolution to send a joint letter of the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil addressed to all Member States inviting \r\ncandidates for the post of Secretary-General and \r\nregularly communicating the names of the candidates, \r\nwho will interact with the members of the General \r\nAssembly. In that regard, my delegation encourages \r\ncandidates to officially present their candidacies in a \r\ntimely manner so that exchanges with Member States \r\nwill not be hurried. My delegation also supports the \r\nprinciple of geographic distribution, which should be \r\nmore balanced, as well as that of gender equality, which \r\nshould absolutely be taken into account. Finally, my \r\ndelegation believes that a democratic, transparent and \r\ninclusive process, if it is seen through to fruition, will \r\nmark a decisive turning point in the selection of the \r\nnext Secretary-General. My delegation is prepared to \r\nwork alongside other delegations in order to participate \r\nconstructively in the process.\r\nOn another point, it is important to note that the \r\nrole and activities of the President of the General \r\nAssembly have evolved throughout the years and that \r\nthe Assembly is increasingly considering issues related \r\nto global challenges. It is therefore essential to give \r\nthe Office of the President the proper personnel and \r\nnecessary resources, specifically financial resources, \r\nso that he is able effectively and efficiently to carry out \r\nthe functions of his mandate in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, thereby preserving the \r\ninstitutional memory of this Office.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reiterates that, in \r\nspite of the significant progress that has been achieved, \r\nthe process of revitalization is still far from complete. \r\nIt requires the commitment of all Member States \r\nand an unfailing political will in order to focus on \r\nmultilateralism and its noble objectives, which we all \r\nsupport.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement (see \r\nA/70/PV.45) made by the representative of Algeria on \r\nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nWe, too, thank the President for convening this \r\nmeeting to discuss the revitalization of the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the implementation of United \r\nNations resolutions.\r\nThe delegation of the Sudan welcomes the \r\nreappointment of the Permanent Representative of \r\nCroatia and the Permanent Representative of Namibia \r\nto co-chair the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly. \r\nWe thank them for their efforts in that regard. We would \r\nalso like to welcome the adoption of resolution 69/321, \r\nentitled “Revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly”, especially as it relates to the nomination \r\nand appointment of the Secretary-General and the role \r\nof the General Assembly in that connection. We also \r\nappreciate the President’s contribution to that process. \r\nWe emphasize that it should be based on the principles \r\nset out in the Charter of the United Nations and carried \r\nout with full transparency and with the participation of \r\nall Member States. We also reiterate the need to abide by \r\nall of the relevant resolutions of the General Assembly, \r\nespecially those related to the rules and regulations \r\nfor nominating and appointing the Secretary-General, \r\nincluding resolution 69/321.\r\nNominating and appointing the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral is a source of concern for many Member \r\nStates. In that regard, my delegation reiterates the need \r\nto respect the General Assembly’s rules of procedure, \r\nincluding rule 141, which relates to the nomination and \r\nappointment of the Secretary-General. We also note \r\nthat the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of the General Assembly should discuss \r\nthis issue, so as to guarantee broader participation by \r\nall Member States.\r\nAs we celebrate the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations, many geopolitical, security and \r\nhumanitarian changes have occurred and we are \r\nwitnessing new threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. That requires a comprehensive review of the \r\nOrganization. Therefore, my delegation welcomes the \r\nSecretary-General’s initiative in appointing Mr. José \r\nRamos-Horta, former President of Timor-Leste, to \r\nundertake a comprehensive review of peacekeeping \r\noperations, as well as the report (see A/70/95) issued \r\nby the Panel in June. My delegation will take part \r\nin that process. We call for the implementation of \r\nall the recommendations in all the relevant United \r\n16/17 15-34949\r\nA/70/PV.46 04/11/2015\r\nNations bodies, such as the Fourth Committee, the \r\nFifth Committees and the Special Committee on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations.\r\nIt is the duty of all Member States, which are \r\nmembers of the General Assembly of course, to \r\nsafeguard and reinforce the Assembly’s mandate and \r\nauthority, as well as the practical authority that it has \r\ndeveloped throughout the seven decades following the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations, in 1945, especially \r\nwith regard to its role in peacekeeping operations. We \r\nwarn against encroaching upon the General Assembly’s \r\nwork and mandate, which could negatively reflect on \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMr. Bodini (San Marino): I would like to \r\ncongratulate the Permanent Representatives of Croatia \r\nand Namibia on their appointments to co-chair the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nSan Marino believes in a strong United Nations \r\nand in its universal values. The General Assembly \r\nis at the centre of the authority and decision-making \r\nprocess of the United Nations system. Over the years, \r\nmany resolutions on the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly have been adopted and have improved the \r\nwork of this very important body. I should like to \r\nmention briefly a few items on which we could focus \r\nour attention.\r\nWe could give to the President of the General \r\nAssembly more authority in his role and increase the \r\nhuman and financial resources of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly to make sure that \r\nhe can effectively accomplish his tasks. We might \r\nalso improve coordination of the work of the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecond Committee in order to fulfil the mandate of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals and to monitor their \r\nimplementation.\r\nWe should continue to hold high-level thematic \r\ndebates. However, the General Assembly should \r\norganize fewer events than in the past — not only to \r\nsecure greater participation by our leaders but also to \r\nallow a small country like ours to be more involved in \r\nsuch endeavours.\r\nWe can improve the working methods of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and of the various committees by \r\nstreamlining their workload with biennial or triennial \r\ndraft resolutions and coordinating the many events in \r\na manner that will allow the greater participation of \r\nall our Missions. We might try to engage one another \r\nduring meetings like this with greater interaction \r\nand fewer formal speeches. Doing so might create a \r\nfriendlier environment and a more expeditious path for \r\nour deliberations.\r\nWhile the General Assembly should not be a \r\nsubstitute for the Security Council in the selection of \r\ncandidates for the post of Secretary-General, we should \r\npursue the implementation of resolution 69/321, in \r\nparticular by conducting informal meetings with the \r\ncandidates.\r\nWe should continue with the good practice of the \r\nSecretary-General in providing informal briefings on \r\nhis travel activities and his priorities. Under the able \r\nleadership of the President, we can advance the reform \r\nof the Security Council. Hopefully, that reform will be \r\nembraced by the vast majority of the membership or \r\nby consensus. With the goal of improving the financial \r\nhealth of the United Nations, we should prepare \r\naccurate United Nations budgets and monitor carefully \r\nactual expenses.\r\nIn conclusion, like many other small countries with \r\nlimited resources and small missions, San Marino seeks \r\na more efficient, more effective and more user-friendly \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): I have the honour \r\nto deliver a brief joint statement on behalf of the \r\nPermanent Representative of Namibia, Ambassador \r\nWilfried Emvula, and myself.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to thank the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for reappointing us as co-Chairs \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of the General Assembly. We feel deeply \r\nhonoured to continue facilitating such a vital, important \r\nand far-reaching process. We thank Member States for \r\nall the kind words of praise and support.\r\nEvidently, there is widespread recognition that \r\nresolution 69/321 represents a success for us all — for \r\nthe United Nations and Member States alike — and it \r\nserves as the best proof of how much can be achieved \r\nthrough constructive, reform-oriented and consensus-\r\nbased work. It is a result of the willingness of Member \r\nStates to engage in a thorough, substantive debate \r\non numerous crucial issues on the subject of General \r\nAssembly revitalization and, in particular, those related \r\nto the selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Clearly, during the sixty-ninth session certain \r\nissues were successfully addressed and provided with \r\n15-34949 17/17\r\n04/11/2015 A/70/PV.46\r\nappropriate, effective solutions. On the other hand, \r\nsome issues are still to be addressed properly during \r\nthis session and beyond.\r\nAs requested by the President of the General \r\nAssembly, during the seventieth session co-Chairs \r\nwill focus in particular on the issue of transparency, \r\nefficiency and accountability in the work of the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly. At the same \r\ntime, we should pay due and full attention to all other \r\nclusters on the General Assembly revitalization agenda, \r\nbearing in mind the latest report of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup (A/69/1007), which is an important point of \r\ndeparture for some aspects of our future discussion, \r\nand remains our point of reference.\r\nWe have taken very careful note of yesterday’s and \r\ntoday’s debate, and we shall take everything that has \r\nbeen said as guidelines for our upcoming work. We \r\nremain, as always, at the disposal of Member States for \r\nconsultation, exchanges of views and the exploration of \r\nnew ideas in the months to come.\r\nThe co-Chairs note an interest by Member States \r\nto exchange views on the subject of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, its transparency \r\nand financing aspects, and especially in hearing the \r\nviews of the President of the General Assembly on \r\nthat particular matter. Therefore, the co-Chairs are \r\nconsidering organizing some informal discussions in \r\nthat regard in the course of this year. It is an important \r\nmatter, and early informal exchanges of views will \r\nbenefit the co-Chairs immensely in charting the best \r\nway forward.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that we look forward \r\nto another fruitful year of deliberations in the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group. We express once again our \r\nfull appreciation for being entrusted with such an \r\nimportant task at this session of the General Assembly. \r\nWe also look forward to members’ positive and active \r\nengagement.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda items 119 and 120.\r\nThe meeting rose at noon.\r\n"
