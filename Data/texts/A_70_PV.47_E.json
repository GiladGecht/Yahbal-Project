Since its \r\ncreation 70 years ago, the Court has played a crucial role \r\nin advancing the rule of law at the international level, \r\nand its judgments and advisory opinions contribute to \r\npromoting international law worldwide. During those \r\nyears, the increased level of activity of the Court has \r\nbeen an indication of the growing desire of States to \r\nsettle their international disputes by peaceful means, in \r\naccordance with the Charter. It has also demonstrated \r\nthat States from all regions of the world have strong \r\nconfidence in the Court and its capacity to deliver \r\njustice for all.\r\nIn April next year, we will celebrate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the first session of the International \r\nCourt of Justice. That will be an occasion to recognize \r\nthe fundamental role that the principal judicial organ \r\nof the United Nations has played in the maintenance of \r\npeace and security in our world, but also in dealing with \r\nthe challenges that lie ahead and how best to overcome \r\nthem, inspired by our commitment to international law.\r\nIt is now my honour to invite Judge Ronny Abraham, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, to take \r\nthe f loor.\r\nMr. Abraham, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice (spoke in French): I would first of all like \r\nto begin by taking this opportunity to congratulate \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventieth session. I wish you \r\nevery success in your mission.\r\nI should also like to express my gratitude to the \r\nAssembly for following the long-standing tradition \r\nof giving the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice the opportunity to present an account of the \r\nCourt’s judicial activity over the previous year. I am \r\nparticularly honoured to address the Assembly for the \r\nfirst time as President and thus to avail myself of a \r\nprivilege that bears witness to the interest in the Court \r\ndisplayed by the General Assembly and the support that \r\nit provides the Court.\r\nIn the course of the judicial year 2014-2015, the \r\nCourt has continued to work, to the best of its abilities, \r\nfor the peaceful settlement of those disputes that the \r\ncommunity of States has seen fit to submit to it. As \r\ncan be seen from the report that I have the honour to \r\npresent today (A/70/4), the Court has made every effort \r\nto meet, in a timely manner, the expectations of the \r\ninternational parties appearing before it. During the \r\nreporting period from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015, \r\nthe total number of contentious cases pending before \r\nthe Court was 14. The Court held hearings in three of \r\nthose cases. \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.47\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n47th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 5 November 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nFirst, in April and May, the Court heard arguments \r\non the merits of the case Certain Activities carried out by \r\nNicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua), \r\nwhich was joined with the case Construction of a Road \r\nin Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. \r\nCosta Rica), accompanied by provisional measures. \r\nThen, in May 2015, the Court held hearings in the case \r\nObligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean \r\n(Bolivia v. Chile). It should, moreover, be noted that \r\nduring the reporting period, beginning on 1 August, \r\nthe Court also held hearings on preliminary objections \r\nin two cases: in September and October, Alleged \r\nViolations of Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces \r\nin the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia); and in \r\nOctober, Question of the Delimitation of the Continental \r\nShelf between Nicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 \r\nnautical miles from the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua \r\nv. Colombia). Currently, all of the cases in which the \r\nCourt has held hearings are under deliberation, with \r\nthe exception of the proceedings between Bolivia and \r\nChile, in which, on 24 September, the Court delivered \r\na judgment in which it found that it has jurisdiction in \r\nthe case, and the proceedings on the merits of the case \r\nhave accordingly been resumed. \r\nDuring the reporting period, the Court also delivered \r\nits judgment on the merits in the case Application of \r\nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \r\nthe Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia). I shall, as is \r\ncustomary, offer a brief presentation of that judgment. I \r\nshall then say a few words about the judgment rendered \r\nsome weeks ago on the preliminary objection raised by \r\nChile in the case Obligation to Negotiate Access to the \r\nPacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile).\r\nThe judgment on the merits, delivered on \r\n3 February, brought to a close the case Application of \r\nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \r\nthe Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia). On 2 July \r\n1999, the Government of the Croatia filed an application \r\ninstituting proceedings against the Federal Republic \r\nof Yugoslavia with respect to a dispute concerning \r\nalleged violations of the 1948 Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide, \r\na Convention that was approved, through the adoption \r\nof resolution 260 (III), on 9 December 1948 and entered \r\ninto force on 12 January 1951. The application invoked \r\narticle IX of the Genocide Convention as the basis \r\nfor the jurisdiction of the Court. On 11 September \r\n2002, the respondent raised preliminary objections \r\nrelating to that jurisdiction and to the admissibility of \r\nCroatia’s application, giving rise to a first judgment on \r\n18 November 2008.\r\nIn its judgment of 3 February, the Court began by \r\nrecalling that the name of the respondent had changed \r\nover the course of the proceedings. In February 2003, \r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had informed the \r\nCourt that it was to be henceforth called Serbia and \r\nMontenegro. Subsequently, following the Republic of \r\nMontenegro’s declaration of independence on 3 June \r\n2006, the Republic of Serbia — which I shall refer to \r\nas Serbia — remained the sole respondent in the case. \r\nThe Court had previously indicated those changes in its \r\n2008 judgment on the preliminary objections. In that \r\njudgment, it had rejected the first and third preliminary \r\nobjections raised by Serbia but had found, however, that \r\nthe second objection was not, in the circumstances of \r\nthe case, of an exclusively preliminary character and \r\nshould therefore be considered in the merits phase. In \r\nthe second objection, Serbia asked the Court to find that \r\nCroatia’s claims, based on acts or omissions that had \r\ntaken place prior to 27 April 1992, the date on which \r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia came into existence \r\nas a separate State, lay beyond its jurisdiction and were, \r\nmoreover, inadmissible. Subject to that conclusion, the \r\nCourt found that it had jurisdiction to entertain Croatia’s \r\napplication. It therefore had to rule on that objection in \r\nits 2015 judgment, before considering, if necessary, the \r\nmerits of Croatia’s claims.\r\nI would also recall that, some months after the 2008 \r\njudgment, Serbia filed a counter-claim, in which it \r\ncontended that Croatia had committed acts of genocide \r\nagainst Croatian Serbs in 1995. The Court had to \r\nconsider that claim as well. Before deciding the dispute, \r\nthe Court first began by setting up the historical and \r\nfactual background to the case. It therefore first recalled \r\nthat both parties to the dispute were sovereign States \r\nthat had emerged from the break-up of the Socialist \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, and it outlined the key \r\nstages of their establishment as such. It then described \r\nthe main events that had taken place in Croatia between \r\n1990 and 1995, and noted in particular that shortly \r\nafter Croatia’s declaration of independence on 25 June \r\n1991, an armed conflict broke out between, on the \r\none hand, Croatia’s armed forces and, on the other, \r\nSerb forces opposed to Croatia’s independence. At \r\nleast from September 1991 on, the Yugoslav National \r\nArmy (JNA) — which, according to Croatia, was by \r\nthen controlled by the Government of the Republic of \r\n15-35218 3/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nSerbia — intervened in the fighting against the Croatian \r\nGovernment forces.\r\nI would like to point out in passing that I have \r\njust used the term Serb forces, as the Court did in \r\nits judgment, to refer collectively to part of the Serb \r\nminority within Croatia and to various paramilitary \r\ngroups, irrespective of the issue of the attribution of \r\ntheir conduct.\r\nThe Court observed that by late 1991, those Serb \r\nforces and the JNA controlled around one third of \r\nCroatian territory within its boundaries in the Socialist \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia, a situation that was to \r\nlast until 1995. Croatia alleged that it was during that \r\nconflict that a genocide had been committed. The Court \r\nalso described how, during the spring and summer of \r\n1995, Croatia had succeeded, as a result of a series of \r\nmilitary operations, in retaking the greater part of the \r\nterritory that had slipped from its control; Serbia, for \r\nits part, alleged in its counter-claim that a genocide had \r\ntaken place during the Croatian Operation Storm in \r\nAugust 1995.\r\nHaving accordingly outlined the background to the \r\ncase, the Court turned to the questions of its jurisdiction \r\nand the admissibility of the parties’ respective \r\nclaims. Starting with the questions of jurisdiction \r\nand admissibility as they arose in the context of \r\nCroatia’s claim, the Court recalled that, in its 2008 \r\njudgment, it had found that it had jurisdiction to rule on \r\nCroatia’s claim regarding acts committed dating from \r\n27 April 1992 — the date when the Federal Republic \r\nof Yugoslavia came into existence, as a separate State, \r\nand became party, by succession, to the Genocide \r\nConvention — but that it had reserved its decision on its \r\njurisdiction pertaining to breaches of the Convention \r\nalleged to have been committed prior to that date.\r\nAfter analysing the parties’ arguments on the \r\nquestion, the Court concluded that it had jurisdiction \r\nto rule on the whole of Croatia’s claim, including that \r\npart of it relating to events prior to 27 April 1992. To \r\nreach that conclusion, the Court began by stating that \r\nthe Federal Republic of Yugoslavia could not have been \r\nbound by the Convention before 27 April 1992, contrary \r\nto Croatia’s main argument; it took note, however, of \r\nan alternative argument relied on by the Applicant, \r\nnamely, that the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, and \r\nsubsequently Serbia, could have succeeded to the \r\nresponsibility of the Socialist Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia for breaches of the Convention prior to that \r\ndate.\r\nThe Court stated that in order to determine whether \r\nSerbia was responsible for breaches of the Convention, \r\nit would first have to decide whether the acts alleged \r\nby Croatia had taken place and, if so, whether they \r\ncontravened the Convention; secondly, if that were \r\nthe case, whether those acts were attributable to \r\nthe Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia at the \r\ntime that they had occurred and whether they had \r\ninvolved the responsibility of the latter; and, thirdly, \r\nassuming that the responsibility of the Socialist Federal \r\nRepublic of Yugoslavia had been involved, whether the \r\nFederal Republic of Yugoslavia had succeeded to that \r\nresponsibility.\r\nNoting that the parties were in disagreement on \r\nthese questions, the Court considered that there was a \r\ndispute between them falling under article IX of the \r\nConvention, namely a\r\n“[dispute] ... relating to the interpretation, application \r\nor fulfilment of the ... Convention, including [one] \r\nrelating to the responsibility of a State for genocide \r\nor for any of the other acts enumerated in article III”.\r\nThe Court concluded that it had jurisdiction to \r\nrule on the dispute by specifying that, in reaching that \r\nconclusion, it was not necessary to take a decision \r\nbeforehand on the aforementioned three questions, \r\nsince they were substantive.\r\nRegarding the question of the admissibility of \r\nCroatia’s claim, the Court noted that Serbia had \r\nargued primarily, as a matter of principle, that it \r\nwas inadmissible because the Federal Republic of \r\nYugoslavia could not be held responsible for acts alleged \r\nto have taken place before it had come into existence as \r\na State, on 27 April 1992; however, it observed that this \r\nargument involved questions of attribution, on which \r\nit was not necessary to rule before considering on the \r\nmerits the acts alleged by Croatia.\r\nThe Court further noted Serbia’s alternative \r\nargument that Croatia’s claim was inadmissible because \r\nit related to events prior to 8 October 1991, the date \r\non which Croatia had come into existence as a State \r\nand become party to the Convention; it pointed out, \r\nhowever, that Croatia had not formulated any separate \r\ndemands for the events that had occurred before and \r\nafter 8 October 1991, and that, rather, it had advanced a \r\n4/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nsingle claim alleging a pattern of conduct increasing in \r\nintensity throughout the course of 1991.\r\nIn that context, the Court considered that what had \r\nhappened prior to 8 October 1991 was, in any event, \r\npertinent to an evaluation of whether what had taken \r\nplace after that date had involved violations of the \r\nGenocide Convention; it accordingly concluded that it \r\nwas not necessary to rule on Serbia’s argument before \r\nit had considered and assessed all of the evidence \r\nsubmitted by Croatia.\r\nThe Court then considered the question of the \r\nadmissibility of Serbia’s counterclaim, in the light of the \r\ncriteria set out in article 80 of its rules of procedure. It \r\narrived at the conclusion that this claim was admissible, \r\ninasmuch as, first, it came within the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt since it fell within the scope of its jurisdiction \r\nunder article IX of the Convention, and, secondly, it \r\nwas directly connected with the subject matter of the \r\nmain claim, both in fact and in law.\r\nThirdly, the Court clarified the question of \r\napplicable law in the case, namely, the Convention \r\non the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \r\nGenocide. It recalled that, under the terms of article II \r\nof the Convention:\r\n“[g]enocide means any of the following acts \r\ncommitted with intent to destroy, in whole or in \r\npart, a national, ethnical, racial or religious group, \r\nas such:\r\n(a) Killing members of the group;\r\n(b) Causing serious bodily or mental harm to \r\nmembers of the group;\r\n(c) Deliberately inflicting on the group conditions \r\nof life calculated to bring about its physical \r\ndestruction in whole or in part;\r\n(d) Imposing measures intended to prevent births \r\nwithin the group;\r\n(e) Forcibly transferring children of the group to \r\nanother group.”\r\nThe Court recalled that genocide thus defined \r\ncontains two constituent elements, namely, the \r\nphysical element, or actus reus — acts that have \r\nbeen committed — and the mental element, or mens \r\nrea — the intent to destroy the group as such.\r\nWith regard, first of all, to the mental element \r\nof genocide, the Court indicated that it is the intent \r\nto destroy, in whole or in part, a national, ethnical, \r\nracial or religious group as such that is the essential \r\ncharacteristic of genocide and that distinguishes it from \r\nother serious crimes. It stated that this is regarded as a \r\ndolus specialis; that is to say, a specific intent which, in \r\norder for genocide to be established, must be present in \r\naddition to the intent required for each of the individual \r\nacts involved. The Court further explained that the \r\nintent must be the physical or biological destruction \r\nof the protected group, or of a substantial part of that \r\ngroup. Evidence of that intent is to be sought, first, \r\nin the State’s policy, although such intent will seldom \r\nbe expressly stated, but it can also be inferred from \r\na pattern of conduct where such intent is the only \r\nreasonable inference to be drawn from the acts in \r\nquestion.\r\nNext, regarding the physical element of the crime \r\nof genocide, the Court recalled the meaning to be given \r\nto the prohibited acts listed in subparagraphs (a) to (e) \r\nof article II of the Convention, which I cited.\r\nFourthly and finally, still in the stage preceding \r\nthe actual consideration of the merits of the case, the \r\nCourt addressed questions of the burden of proof, the \r\nstandard of proof and the methods of proof applicable \r\nin the case. It recalled in particular that it is, in \r\nprinciple, for the party alleging a fact to demonstrate \r\nits existence. It further noted that claims against a \r\nState involving charges of exceptional gravity must be \r\nproved by evidence that is fully conclusive. Finally, it \r\nlaid down certain principles governing consideration of \r\nthe evidence submitted by the parties, which in these \r\nproceedings included documents from the International \r\nCriminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, reports \r\nfrom official or independent bodies, and written \r\nstatements of witnesses.\r\nI now turn to the Court’s consideration of the merits \r\nof the case. I shall begin by discussing the Court’s \r\ntreatment of Croatia’s claim, which comes first in the \r\njudgment, and shall then turn to its treatment of Serbia’s \r\ncounter-claim, which is dealt with subsequently.\r\nRegarding Croatia’s claim that the Court should \r\nfind Serbia responsible for violation of the 1948 \r\nGenocide Convention, the Court first considered \r\nwhether acts constituting the actus reus of genocide \r\nhad been committed by the Yugoslav National Army \r\nor Serb forces against members of the national or \r\nethnical Croat group between 1991 and 1995. Following \r\na thorough analysis of the evidence in the case file, \r\n15-35218 5/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nit concluded that, in the regions of Eastern Slavonia, \r\nWestern Slavonia, Banovina/Banija, Kordun, Lika \r\nand Dalmatia, the Yugoslav National Army and Serb \r\nforces had committed acts constituting the actus reus of \r\ngenocide within the meaning of subparagraphs (a) and \r\n(b) of article 2 of the Convention, namely, the killing \r\nof members of the national or ethnical Croat group and \r\nacts causing serious bodily or mental harm to members \r\nof that group. On the other hand, the Court stated that \r\nit was not persuaded that acts capable of constituting \r\nthe actus reus of genocide had also been proved in \r\nrelation to subparagraphs (c) and (d) of article 2 of the \r\nConvention, that is, it considered that it had not been \r\nestablished that conditions of life calculated to bring \r\nabout the group’s physical destruction, in whole or in \r\npart, had been deliberately inflicted, or that measures \r\nintended to prevent births within the group had been \r\nimposed.\r\nThe actus reus of genocide within the meaning of \r\nsubparagraphs (a) and (b) of article 2 of the Convention \r\nhaving thus been established, the Court examined \r\nwhether the acts in question had been committed with \r\ngenocidal intent. It stated that, in the absence of direct \r\nevidence of such intent, it would consider whether a \r\npattern of conduct had been established from which the \r\nonly reasonable inference to be drawn was an intent \r\non the part of the perpetrators of those acts to destroy \r\na substantial part of the group of ethnic Croats. After \r\na thorough analysis of the evidence in its possession, \r\nthe Court considered that the crimes committed against \r\nCroats appeared to have been aimed at the forced \r\ndisplacement of the majority of the Croat population \r\nfrom the regions concerned, and not at its physical or \r\nbiological destruction.\r\nIn the absence of proof of the necessary specific \r\nintent to destroy the protected group, in whole or in part, \r\nthe Court found that Croatia had failed to substantiate \r\nits allegation that genocide or other breaches of the \r\nConvention had been committed. It accordingly rejected \r\nCroatia’s claim in its entirety and considered that it \r\nneed not rule on other matters, such as the attribution \r\nof the acts found to have been committed, or succession \r\nto responsibility.\r\nRegarding Serbia’s counter-claim, on the basis \r\nof the evidence submitted to it, the Court concluded \r\nthat, during and after Operation Storm, carried out \r\nin August 1995, and in its aftermath, forces of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia had perpetrated acts falling within \r\nsubparagraphs (a) and (b) of article 2 of the Convention, \r\nthat is, the killing of members of the national or ethnical \r\nSerb group who were f leeing or had remained within \r\nthe areas of which Croatian forces had taken control, \r\nand acts constituting serious bodily or mental harm to \r\nmembers of the group.\r\nTo respond to the question of the existence of a \r\ngenocidal intent, the Court examined in particular the \r\ntranscript of the meeting held on the island of Brioni, \r\nunder the chairmanship of the then President of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia, in order to prepare Operation Storm. \r\nIt also considered the overall course of the military \r\noperations conducted by Croatia during the period \r\n1992-1995. It found that the intent to destroy, in whole \r\nor in part, the national or ethnical group of the Croatian \r\nSerbs had not been proven, and noted in particular that \r\nwhile acts constituting the actus reus of genocide had \r\nbeen committed, they were not perpetrated on a scale \r\nsuch that they could only reasonably demonstrate the \r\nexistence of a genocidal intent.\r\nThe Court therefore found that neither genocide nor \r\nother violations of the Genocide Convention had been \r\nproved and therefore rejected Serbia’s counter-claim \r\nin its entirety. Those are the main conclusions of the \r\njudgment rendered by the Court on 3 February.\r\nAs I mentioned in the beginning of my statement, \r\non 24 September the Court delivered a second judgment \r\nbearing on the preliminary objection to jurisdiction \r\nraised by the respondent in the case Obligation to \r\nNegotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile). \r\nI would recall that, on 24 April 2013, the Government \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia filed with the \r\nRegistrar of the Court an application introducing \r\nproceedings against the Republic of Chile in the matter \r\nof a dispute in relation to\r\n“Chile’s obligation to negotiate in good faith \r\nand effectively with Bolivia in order to reach an \r\nagreement granting Bolivia a fully sovereign \r\naccess to the Pacific Ocean”.\r\nBolivia attempted to argue for the Court’s \r\njurisdiction by invoking article XXXI of the American \r\nTreaty on Pacific Settlement, known as the Pact of \r\nBogotá, which provides that\r\n“In conformity with article 36, paragraph \r\n2, of the Statute of the International Court of \r\nJustice, the High Contracting Parties declare that \r\nthey recognize, in relation to any other American \r\nState, the jurisdiction of the Court as compulsory \r\n6/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nipso facto, without the necessity of any special \r\nagreement so long as the present Treaty is in force, \r\nin all disputes of a juridical nature that arise among \r\nthem concerning:\r\na) the interpretation of a treaty;\r\nb) any question of international law;\r\nc) the existence of any fact which, if established, \r\nwould constitute the breach of an international \r\nobligation;\r\nd) The nature or extent of the reparation to \r\nbe made for the breach of an international \r\nobligation”.\r\nChile, in its preliminary objection, claimed that, by \r\napplying another provision of the same treaty, namely, \r\narticle VI, the Court did not have jurisdiction to rule on \r\nthe dispute submitted by Bolivia. In the words of that \r\narticle,\r\n“[T]he aforesaid procedures, furthermore, \r\nmay not be applied to matters already settled by \r\narrangement between the parties, or by arbitral \r\naward or by decision of an international court, or \r\nwhich are governed by agreements or treaties in \r\nforce on the date of the conclusion of the present \r\nTreaty”.\r\nAccording to Chile, the matter in dispute in the case \r\nwas not, as the application indicated, the existence of \r\nan obligation to negotiate Bolivia’s sovereign access to \r\nthe sea and Chile’s alleged breaching of that obligation. \r\nThe respondent argued that the matters actually at issue \r\nin the present case were territorial sovereignty and \r\nthe character of Bolivia’s access to the Pacific Ocean, \r\nmatters that had, according to Chile, been settled by \r\narrangement in the 1904 peace treaty. According to \r\nChile, those issues are governed by the aforementioned \r\ntreaty.\r\nBolivia, in response to that objection, stated that \r\nthe dispute was over the existence of an obligation \r\nincumbent on Chile to negotiate in good faith a \r\nsovereign access of Bolivia to the Pacific Ocean and \r\nthe non-compliance with that obligation. According to \r\nBolivia, such an obligation arose from “agreements”, \r\nfrom “diplomatic practice” and “a series of statements \r\nattributable to ... [Chile]”, which go back over more \r\nthan a century, and it existed independently of the \r\nTreaty of Peace and Friendship of 1904 between Chile \r\nand Bolivia. Bolivia concluded that article VI of the \r\nAmerican Treaty on Pacific Settlement did not present \r\nan obstacle to the jurisdiction of the Court by virtue \r\nof article XXXI of that Treaty, as long as the issues in \r\ndispute in the present case did not constitute issues that \r\nhad been resolved or were governed by the 1904 Peace \r\nTreaty within the meaning of article VI.\r\nIn its ruling, the Court began by observing that, as \r\npresented, the claim covered a dispute relating to the \r\nexistence of an obligation to negotiate sovereign access \r\nto the sea and the non-compliance with that obligation. \r\nThe Court then considered that, even if one could \r\nassume that sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean was \r\nBolivia’s ultimate goal, it was appropriate to make a \r\ndistinction between that goal and the dispute, which \r\nwere linked but separate matters. It was the dispute that \r\nhad been submitted in the application. It appeared that \r\nBolivia did not request the Court to state and decide \r\nwhether it was entitled to access to the sea in that \r\ndispute.\r\nThe Court held in the case that, in the light of \r\nthe subject of the dispute as it had been defined, the \r\nissues under dispute between the parties had not “yet \r\nbeen resolved through an agreement between [them]” \r\nnor were they “governed by agreements or treaties in \r\nforce” at the time of the signing of the Pact of Bogotá \r\non 30 April 1948. That conclusion was based on the \r\nfact that the relevant provisions of the 1904 Peace \r\nTreaty, invoked by Chile to support its plea of lack \r\nof competence or jurisdiction, do not explicitly or \r\nimplicitly deal with the issue of an obligation that would \r\nfall on Chile to negotiate with Bolivia on the matter \r\nof sovereign access to the Pacific Ocean. The Court \r\ntherefore concluded that article VI did not represent an \r\nobstacle to the jurisdiction that article ХХХI of the Pact \r\nof Bogotá granted to the Court. It therefore rejected the \r\npreliminary plea of lack of jurisdiction raised by Chile.\r\nI insist on the fact that the Court has not heard \r\narguments of the parties on the merits of the case, \r\nthat the ruling that it delivered was aimed strictly at \r\nestablishing whether it had jurisdiction or not to hear \r\nthe case that had been submitted by Bolivia, and that \r\nnothing in the judgment of 24 September can and \r\nshould be interpreted as prejudging the substantive \r\nissues raised in the claim by Bolivia.\r\nI have now finished with the report regarding the \r\ntwo rulings issued by the Court over the past year. I \r\nwould now like to comment on the other decisions taken \r\nby the Court during the period covered by my report.\r\n15-35218 7/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI will now speak in English, as it is our practice at \r\nthe Court, in accordance with the Statute, to work at all \r\ntimes in both French and English.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the case Questions \r\nrelating to the Seizure and Detention of Certain \r\nDocuments and Data (Timor-Leste v. Australia) was \r\nstruck from the Court’s List by an order of 11 June 2015. \r\nThe oral hearings on the merits, which were scheduled \r\nfor September 2014, had first been postponed following \r\nthe receipt of a joint letter, dated 1 September 2014, \r\nwhereby the agents of Timor-Leste and Australia \r\nrequested the Court “to adjourn the hearing set to \r\ncommence on 17 September 2014 in order to enable \r\n[them] to seek an amicable settlement”. In the same \r\nletter, the agents of the parties had also raised the \r\npossibility that the parties might jointly seek a change \r\nin the order indicating provisional measures that the \r\nCourt had adopted on 3 March 2014. On 15 March 2015, \r\nthe agent of Australia indicated, in a separate letter, \r\nthat his Government wanted “to return the materials \r\nremoved from the premises of Collaery Lawyers on \r\n3 December 2013”. In order to allow for that restitution, \r\nthe respondent State also requested, pursuant to article \r\n76 of the Rules of Court, a “modification of the second \r\ninterim measure”, which the Court had indicated in its \r\norder of 3 March 2014 and which required Australia to \r\n“retain under seal the documents and electronic data \r\nseized, and any copies thereof, until further decision of \r\nthe Court”.\r\nBy an order rendered on 22 April 2015, the Court \r\nfirst\r\n“[a]uthorised the return, still sealed, to the firm \r\nCollaery Lawyers of all the documents and data \r\nseized on 3 December 2013 by Australia, and \r\nany copies thereof, under the supervision of a \r\nrepresentative of Timor-Leste appointed for that \r\npurpose;”\r\nSecondly,\r\n“[r]equested the parties to inform it that the return \r\nof documents and data seized on 3 December 2013 \r\nby Australia, and any copies thereof, had been \r\neffected and on what date that return had taken \r\nplace;”\r\nThirdly,\r\n“[d]ecided that, upon the return of the documents \r\nand data seized on 3 December 2013 by Australia, \r\nand any copies thereof, the second measure \r\nindicated by the Court in its order of 3 March 2014 \r\nshall cease to have effect”.\r\nThe Court subsequently received confirmation by \r\nboth parties that on 12 May 2015 Australia had returned \r\nthe documents and data seized on 3 December 2013. \r\nThen the agent of Timor-Leste informed the Court that \r\nhis Government wished to discontinue the proceedings, \r\nstating that,\r\n“[F]ollowing the return of the seized documents \r\nand data by Australia on 12 May 2015, Timor-\r\nLeste successfully achieved the purpose of its \r\napplication to the Court, namely, the return of \r\nTimor-Leste’s rightful property, and therefore \r\nAustralia recognizes that its actions had violated \r\nthe sovereign rights of Timor-Leste”.\r\nAustralia, which had been asked to state its views \r\non Timor-Leste’s request for discontinuance, informed \r\nthe Court that it had no objection to the discontinuance \r\nof the proceeding as requested by Timor-Leste.\r\nOn the basis of those elements, in my capacity \r\nas President of the Court, I placed on record the \r\ndiscontinuance by the applicant of the proceedings and \r\ndirected that the case be removed from the Court’s List. \r\nNeedless to say, the fact that that contentious procedure \r\ndid not require to a judgment shows that the Court \r\nassisted the parties in seeking a solution to the dispute \r\nbetween them. That highlights the role that the Court \r\ncan play, even indirectly, in the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes.\r\nHaving recalled the principal decisions handed \r\ndown by the International Court of Justice in the course \r\nof the past year, I now come to the new cases submitted \r\nto it.\r\nDuring the reporting period, a new case was placed \r\non the List, and the proceedings have resumed in \r\nanother case, with regard to the question of reparations. \r\nRegarding the first case, Somalia instituted proceedings \r\nagainst Kenya on 28 August 2014 relating to a dispute \r\nconcerning maritime delimitation in the Indian Ocean. \r\nIn its application, Somalia contends, on the one hand, \r\nthat both States disagree about the location of the \r\nmaritime boundary in the area where their maritime \r\nentitlements overlap and asserts, on the other hand, that \r\ndiplomatic negotiations, in which their respective views \r\n8/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nhave been fully exchanged, have failed to resolve the \r\ndisagreement. It then proceeds to requesting the Court\r\n“to determine, on the basis of international law, the \r\ncomplete course of the single maritime boundary \r\ndividing all the maritime areas appertaining to \r\nSomalia and to Kenya in the Indian Ocean, including \r\nthe continental shelf beyond 200 [nautical miles]”.\r\nThe applicant further asks the Court to determine the \r\nprecise geographical coordinates of the single maritime \r\nboundary in the Indian Ocean.\r\nIn the view of the applicant, the maritime boundary \r\nbetween the parties in the territorial sea, exclusive \r\neconomic zone and continental shelf should be \r\nestablished in accordance with, respectively, articles \r\n15, 74 and 83 of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea. Somalia explains that, accordingly, the \r\nboundary line in the territorial sea\r\n“should be a median line as specified in article 15, \r\nsince there are no special circumstances that would \r\njustify departure from such a line”\r\nand that, in the cases of the exclusive economic zone \r\nand the continental shelf, the boundary\r\n“should be established according to the three-step \r\nprocess the Court has consistently employed in its \r\napplication of articles 74 and 83”.\r\nSomalia adds that\r\n“Kenya’s current position on the maritime boundary \r\nis that it should be a straight line emanating from \r\nthe parties’ land boundary terminus and extending \r\ndue east along the parallel of latitude on which the \r\nland boundary terminus sits, through the full extent \r\nof the territorial sea, exclusive economic zone and \r\ncontinental shelf, including the continental shelf \r\nbeyond 200 [nautical miles]”.\r\nBy an order of 16 October 2014, I fixed 13 July 2015 \r\nas a time limit for the filing of a memorial by Somalia, \r\nand 27 May 2016 for the filing of a counter-memorial \r\nby Kenya. After the memorial of Somalia was filed \r\nwithin the set time limit, Kenya raised, on 7 October \r\n2015, certain preliminary objections to the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court and to the admissibility of the application. \r\nThe proceedings on the merits have therefore been \r\nsuspended, and the Court fixed 5 February 2016 as the \r\ntime limit within which Somalia may present a written \r\nstatement with its observations and submissions on the \r\npreliminary objections raised by Kenya.\r\nFurthermore, by an order dated 1 July 2015, the \r\nCourt decided to resume the proceedings in the case \r\nconcerning Armed Activities on the Territory of the \r\nCongo (Democratic Republic of the Congo v. Uganda) \r\nwith regard to the question of reparations.\r\nIt is recalled that the Court delivered its judgment \r\non the merits in the case on 19 December 2005. In that \r\njudgment it found, on the one hand, that Uganda was \r\nunder obligation to make reparation to the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo for the injury caused by \r\nUganda’s violation of the principle of the non-use of \r\nforce in international relations and the principle of \r\nnon-intervention, of obligations incumbent upon it \r\nunder international human rights law and international \r\nhumanitarian law, and of other obligations incumbent \r\nupon it under international law and, on the other hand, \r\nthat the Democratic Republic of the Congo was under \r\nobligation to make reparation to Uganda for the injury \r\ncaused by the Democratic Republic of the Congo’s \r\nviolation of obligations incumbent upon it under the \r\n1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. In \r\nthe same judgment, the Court decided that, failing \r\nagreement between the parties, it would settle the \r\nquestion of the reparation due to each of them and \r\nreserved for that purpose the subsequent procedure in \r\nthe case.\r\nOver the years, the parties have transmitted to the \r\nCourt certain information concerning the negotiations \r\nthat they have held to settle the question of reparation. \r\nHowever, on 13 May 2015, the Registry of the Court \r\nreceived from the Democratic Republic of the Congo a \r\ndocument entitled “New application to the International \r\nCourt of Justice”, requesting the Court to decide \r\nthe question of the reparation due to the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo in the case.\r\nIn its order of 1 July 2015, the Court observed that\r\n“although the Parties have tried to settle the \r\nquestion of reparations directly, they have been \r\nunable to reach an agreement in that respect”.\r\nThe Court therefore decided to resume the proceedings \r\nin the case with regard to the question of reparations \r\nand fixed 6 January 2016 as the time limit for the filing \r\nby the Democratic Republic of the Congo of a memorial \r\non the reparations that it considers to be owed to it by \r\nUganda, and for the filing by Uganda of a memorial on \r\nthe reparations that it considers to be owed to it by the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\n15-35218 9/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nTogether with the new case Somalia v. Kenya, that \r\nbrings to 12 the total number of cases currently on the \r\nCourt’s docket.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIt will be apparent from my report that the activities \r\nof the International Court of Justice remain within the \r\narea of the peaceful settlement of inter-State disputes. \r\nHaving succeeded in eliminating the judicial backlog \r\nthat it was facing, even as late as a few years ago, the \r\nCourt will intensify its efforts to make optimum use \r\nof the modest resources at its disposal, with a view to \r\nachieving prompt resolution of the disputes submitted \r\nto it. To do so, it will not hesitate to continue its practice \r\nof dealing with several cases concurrently.\r\nThe Assembly will certainly have noted, at the \r\nstart of my address, that four cases are currently under \r\ndeliberation. That fact bears witness to the Court’s \r\nconcern, as it approaches its seventieth anniversary, to \r\ndischarge its noble and uplifting judicial mission within \r\na reasonable time frame. The Court has successfully \r\nfaced each new challenge posed by the complexity \r\nof legal relations between States. It will keep rising \r\nto those challenges in order to fulfil its role as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations. It is \r\nworth recalling that it does so at a minimum cost for \r\nStates. It trusts that, in the exercise of its functions, the \r\nCourt can keep relying on the constant support of the \r\nAssembly.\r\nI should like to conclude by reminding everyone \r\nthat the Court, which took up its office a few months \r\nafter the entry into force of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, will be marking its seventieth anniversary next \r\nApril. The event will be celebrated in a formal session \r\nin The Hague in the presence of His Majesty the King \r\nof the Netherlands. The Court will also be organizing a \r\nseminar, attended by eminent jurists, on various legal \r\ntopics directly related to its work. That event will be an \r\nopportunity both to celebrate the work accomplished \r\nover the past seventy years and to reflect on the new \r\nchallenges facing the Court.\r\nOnce again. I would like to express my gratitude \r\nfor the opportunity to address the Assembly. I wish \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session every \r\nsuccess.\r\nMr. Gharibi (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nI would first like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for his comprehensive \r\nreport on the work of the Court (A/70/4). The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement attaches great importance to \r\nagenda item 75, “Report of the International Court of \r\nJustice”, and takes note of the account contained in the \r\nreport on the activities of the Court between 1 August \r\n2014 to 31 July 2015, as requested by the decision of \r\nthe Assembly last year. I would also like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Court for his statement in presenting \r\nhis report to the General Assembly today.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms and \r\nunderscores its principled positions concerning the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use or threat \r\nof use of force. The International Court of Justice plays \r\na significant role in promoting and encouraging the \r\nsettlement of international disputes by peaceful means, \r\nas reflected in the Charter of the United Nations, and \r\ndoes so in such a manner that international peace and \r\nsecurity and justice are not endangered.\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe Movement endeavours to generate further \r\nprogress in the promotion of full respect for international \r\nlaw and, in that regard, commends the role of the Court \r\nin promoting the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes, in accordance with the relevant provisions of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the Statute of the \r\nCourt, in particular Articles 33 and 94 of the Charter.\r\nIn regard to the advisory opinions of the Court, we \r\nnote the fact that the Security Council has not sought \r\nany advisory opinion from the Court since 1970, and \r\nthe Movement urges the Security Council to make \r\ngreater use of the International Court of Justice, the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, as a \r\nsource of advisory opinions and interpretations of the \r\nrelevant norms of international law, as well as opinions \r\non controversial issues. It further requests the Council \r\nto use the Court as a source of interpretations relating \r\nto relevant international law issues, and also urges it \r\nto consider having Council decisions reviewed by the \r\nCourt, with a view to ensuring their adherence to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law. \r\nThe Movement also invites the General Assembly, \r\nother bodies of the United Nations and the specialized \r\nagencies so authorized to request advisory opinions \r\nfrom the International Court of Justice on legal \r\nquestions arising within the scope of their activities.\r\n10/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms the \r\nimportance of the unanimous nature of the Court’s \r\nadvisory opinion issued on 8 July 1996, entitled the \r\n“Legality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons”. \r\nOn that issue, the Court concluded that an obligation \r\nexists to pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion \r\nnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its \r\naspects under strict and effective international control.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement continues to call on \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, to fully respect the 9 July \r\n2004 advisory opinion of the Court entitled “Legal \r\nConsequences of the Construction of a Wall in the \r\nOccupied Palestinian Territory”, and calls upon all \r\nStates to respect and ensure respect of the provisions \r\ncontained therein aimed at ending the Israeli occupation \r\nthat began in 1967 and establishing an independent \r\nState of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nMr. Mamabolo (South Africa): My delegation has \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates. The African Group associates itself with the \r\nstatement just delivered by the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nAt the outset, the African Group would like to thank \r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nRonny Abraham, for his presentation and also for the \r\nreport of the Court on its work (A/70/4). The African \r\nGroup continues to consider the International Court of \r\nJustice as the pre-eminent mechanism for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes at the international level. It \r\nshould be kept in mind that the Court, as a court of \r\njustice and, moreover, the principal judicial organ of \r\nthe United Nations, occupies a special position.\r\nEverything that the Court does is aimed at \r\npromoting the rule of law. The World Court hands down \r\njudgments and advisory opinions in accordance with \r\nits Statute, which is an integral part of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, and thus contributes to promoting \r\nand clarifying international law. The African Group \r\nwelcomes the reaffirmed confidence that States have \r\nshown in the Court’s ability to resolve their disputes. \r\nIn particular, we are pleased to see that States continue \r\nto refer disputes to the Court. We commend States for \r\nno longer limiting their referral of cases to matters of \r\nlittle political significance and for referring disputes \r\ninvolving weighty political issues. The number of cases \r\ncurrently pending on the Court’s docket is a reflection \r\nof the esteem in which the States hold the International \r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of international \r\njudicial dispute-settlement mechanisms of both a \r\nspecialized and a regional nature, the Court continues \r\nto attract a wide range of cases covering many areas. \r\nWhile the Court’s determination that the requirement to \r\ncooperate is based principally on treaty obligations, it \r\nalso clearly draws upon general principles, particularly \r\nin making the link between procedural and substantive \r\nobligations. The principle of prevention, enunciated in \r\nan earlier Court decision, notably the Corfu Channel \r\ncase and the advisory opinion concerning the Legality \r\nof the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, is drawn upon \r\nsignificantly by the Court. As such, the African Group \r\nreaffirms the importance of the unanimous Court \r\nadvisory opinion issued on 8 July 1996 concerning the \r\nLegality of the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. In that \r\ndecision, the International Court of Justice concluded \r\nthat there exists an obligation to pursue in good faith \r\nand bring to a conclusion negotiations leading to nuclear \r\ndisarmament in all its aspects under strict and effective \r\ninternational control. In that respect, it is interesting \r\nto note that the current list of cases before the Court \r\nincludes cases on obligations concerning negotiations \r\nrelating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race and to \r\nnuclear disarmament. \r\nBy an order dated 19 July 2015, the Court fixed the \r\ntime limit for the filing by the Republic of the Marshall \r\nIslands of a written statement of its observations and \r\nsubmissions on the preliminary objections raised by the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \r\nin the case. The Marshall Islands alleges breaches of \r\narticle VI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT) by the United Kingdom. \r\nArticle VI of the NPT provides that \r\n“[e]ach of the Parties to the Treaty undertakes \r\nto pursue negotiations in good faith on effective \r\nmeasures relating to cessation of the nuclear arms \r\nrace at an early date and to nuclear disarmament, and \r\non a treaty on general and complete disarmament \r\nunder strict and effective international control.”\r\nTo that end, the Marshall Islands contends that the \r\nUnited Kingdom has breached, and continues to breach, \r\nits legal duty to perform its obligations under the NPT \r\nand customary international law in good faith.\r\nOnce again, by an order dated 9 July 2015, the \r\nCourt extended from 17 July 2015 to 1 December 2015 \r\n15-35218 11/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nthe time limit for the filing of the counter-memorial \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on the questions \r\nof the jurisdiction of the Court and the admissibility \r\nof its application in the case. We eagerly await those \r\njudgments, with the hope that they will build on the \r\nalready rich wealth of jurisprudence in this area, and in \r\ninternational law in general.\r\nThe importance of advisory opinions on legal \r\nquestions referred to the International Court of Justice \r\ncannot be overstated in the pursuit of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes in accordance with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. It is therefore rather disappointing \r\nthat during the period under review, no requests for \r\nadvisory opinions were made.\r\nMs. Cooper (Australia): On behalf of Canada, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand (CANZ), I would like \r\nto thank the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Judge Ronny Abraham, for his informative \r\nreport (A/70/4) on the work of the Court over the past \r\nyear. I would also like to thank former President Judge \r\nTomka for his important contribution during his term \r\nas President.\r\nThe International Court of Justice plays a critical \r\nrole in the peaceful settlement of disputes between \r\nStates and in providing advisory opinions on emerging \r\nor controversial issues in international law. CANZ \r\ncountries continue to support the International Court \r\nof Justice as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. The Court’s demanding caseload, dealing with \r\na variety of subject matters, serves to demonstrate its \r\nwide appeal and highlights the important role it plays \r\nin the promotion of the rule of law. Looking at the \r\nCourt’s work over the past year, cases before the Court \r\ncontinued to raise issues at the forefront of international \r\nlaw. We understand that the agenda of the Court in the \r\nyear ahead will remain a busy one.\r\nInternational law and the rule of law are the \r\nfoundations of the international system. As States that \r\naccept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court and \r\nhave been parties to proceedings before it, the CANZ \r\ncountries are convinced that greater acceptance of \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court contributes \r\nto strengthening the rule of law internationally by \r\nbroadening the options available to States to ensure the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. It also helps the Court \r\nto fulfil its role more effectively by permitting it to \r\nfocus on the substance of disputes more quickly. We \r\ncontinue to urge Member States that have not done so \r\nto deposit with the Secretary-General a declaration of \r\nacceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction.\r\nFinally, the CANZ group would like to express \r\nits appreciation to Judge Sepúlveda Amor for his vital \r\ncontribution to the development of international law \r\nthrough his work as Judge and Vice-President, and to \r\nwish him well in his future endeavours. We would also \r\nlike to thank and acknowledge Judge Keith of New \r\nZealand for his substantial contribution to the Court’s \r\nwork. Similarly, we also would like to recognize Judge \r\nSkotnikov for his work as Judge on the Court. The \r\nCANZ group also congratulates Judges Crawford, \r\nGevorgian and Robinson on their elections to the \r\nCourt, and Judges Bennouna and Donoghue for their \r\nre-elections to the Court.\r\nWe look forward to continuing to support the Court \r\nin its central contribution to the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes.\r\nMrs. Sule (India): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank Judge Ronny Abraham, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for his comprehensive \r\nreport (A/70/4) on the judicial activities of the Court \r\nfor the period from August 2014 to July 2015. I also \r\nthank him and Vice-President Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed \r\nYusuf for guiding the work of the Court.\r\nAs the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, the Court is poised to celebrate its seventieth \r\nanniversary in April next year. The International \r\nCourt of Justice is entrusted with the task of the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes between States, which \r\nis fundamental for fulfilment of one of the purposes \r\nof the United Nations, namely, the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. We acknowledge \r\nthat the Court has fulfilled that task admirably since \r\nits establishment and has acquired a well-deserved \r\nreputation as an impartial institution, maintaining the \r\nhighest legal standards in accordance with its mandate \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations, of which the \r\nStatute of the Court is an integral part.\r\nOne of the primary goals of the United Nations, as \r\nstated in the Preamble of the United Nations Charter, \r\nis to establish conditions under which justice and \r\nrespect for international obligations can be maintained. \r\nThe International Court of Justice, as the only Court \r\nwith general international law jurisdiction, is uniquely \r\nplaced to help achieve that goal.\r\n12/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nThe report of the Court illustrates the importance \r\nStates attach to the Court and the confidence they place \r\nin it. The importance of the Court is also evident from \r\nthe number, nature and variety of cases that the Court \r\ndeals with and, in doing so, its ability to deal with the \r\ncomplex aspects of public international law.\r\nThe judgments delivered by the Court have \r\nplayed an important role in the interpretation and \r\nclarification of the rules of international law, as well \r\nas in the progressive development and codification of \r\ninternational law. In the performance of its judicial \r\nfunctions, the Court has remained highly sensitive to \r\nthe political realities and sentiments of States, while \r\nacting in accordance with the provisions of the United \r\nNations Charter, its own Statute and other applicable \r\nrules of international law.\r\nDuring the judicial year 2014-2015, the Court \r\ndelivered a judgment, held public hearings in two \r\ncases and handed down nine orders. The number of \r\ncontentious cases on the Court’s docket stands at 12. \r\nThe universality of the Court is evident from the fact \r\nthat States from across all the continents submitted \r\ncases to the Court for adjudication.\r\nThe cases before the Court involve a wide variety \r\nof subject matter, such as territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes, environmental damage and the conservation \r\nof living resources, violations of territorial integrity, \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights, genocide, the interpretation and application \r\nof international conventions and treaties and the \r\ninterpretation of the Court’s own judgments.\r\nThe Court’s second function is to provide advisory \r\nopinions on legal questions referred to it by the organs of \r\nthe United Nations and specialized agencies. Although \r\nno request for its advisory opinion was made during \r\nthe past judicial year, that function of the Court adds to \r\nits important role of clarifying key international legal \r\nissues. The report of the Court rightly points out that \r\n“everything the Court does is aimed at promoting the \r\nrule of law” (A/70/4, para. 23), in particular through its \r\njudgments and advisory opinions.\r\nIt is worth mentioning that the Court ensures the \r\ngreatest possible global awareness of its decisions \r\nthrough its publications, multimedia offerings and \r\nwebsite, which now features the Court’s entire \r\njurisprudence, as well as that of its predecessor, the \r\nPermanent Court of International Justice. Those \r\nsources provide useful information for States wishing \r\nto submit a potential dispute to the Court.\r\nWe share the concern of the Court concerning \r\nproblems relating to a health risk due to the presence of \r\nasbestos in the Peace Palace, and we support all efforts \r\nrequired to deal with it.\r\nFinally, India wishes to reaffirm its strong support \r\nto the Court and to acknowledge the importance that \r\nthe international community attaches to the work of the \r\nCourt.\r\nMr. Xu Hong (China) (spoke in Chinese): It gives \r\nme great pleasure to speak on this agenda item on the \r\nreport of the International Court of Justice (A/70/4) at \r\nthe current session of the General Assembly. At the \r\noutset, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, please allow \r\nme to thank President Abraham for his statement. My \r\nthanks also go to all the judges and staff of the Court \r\nfor their hard work over the past year.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe United Nations. The Court’s history spans nearly \r\n70 years. The judicial activities of the Court represent \r\nan important means in peacefully settling disputes. \r\nThat practice, dating back nearly 70 years, has proved \r\nthat the Court, as one of the six major organs and the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, plays \r\nan indispensable role in fulfilling the fundamental \r\npurpose of the United Nations, namely, maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. China appreciates the \r\nwork of and contribution by the Court in that regard.\r\nDuring its nearly 70-year history, the Court has \r\ndelivered 120 verdicts and issued 27 advisory opinions \r\non a wide range of important issues, such as the non-use \r\nof force, non-interference in internal affairs, diplomatic \r\nand consular relations and decolonization. In those \r\njudicial activities, the Court has applied, interpreted, \r\nclarified or confirmed the relevant principles of \r\ninternational law and the fundamental norms of \r\ninternational relations, thereby contributing to the \r\nfurther clarification of norms governing State-to-State \r\nrelations. Like the rest of the international community, \r\nChina has always closely followed the judicial \r\nactivities of the Court and attaches great importance \r\nto the significant role of the Court in promoting the \r\ndevelopment of international law. \r\nThe Chinese delegation has also noted in the reports \r\nsubmitted to the General Assembly in recent years that \r\nthe Court has repeatedly referred to the difficulties it \r\n15-35218 13/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nfaces in terms of human and financial resources. My \r\ndelegation believes it critical that the Court should \r\nhave resources that are commensurate with its status \r\nand role within the United Nations framework, which \r\nis essential to ensuring its effective operation and high-\r\nquality judicial activities.\r\nAs an active advocate for the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, China supports dispute settlement through \r\nsuch appropriate means as negotiations, dialogue and \r\nconsultations. The selection and application of the \r\nmeans of dispute settlement should be made in strict \r\naccordance with the principle of sovereign equality and \r\nin full respect of the wishes of the States concerned. \r\nChina is consistently committed to settling disputes \r\nthrough friendly consultations and, as always, will \r\nsupport the Court in fulfilling its mandate. In recent \r\nyears, the workload of the Court has been on the \r\nrise — a fact that reflects both the important role played \r\nby the Court in the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes and the trust in and expectation of impartiality \r\nfrom the Court on the part of the international \r\ncommunity, especially the parties to a dispute. China \r\nhopes that the Court will continue to faithfully perform \r\nits judicial function in accordance with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the Statute of the Court, \r\nseek peaceful settlement of international disputes and \r\nmake further contributions to the maintenance of the \r\ninternational order and system, with the United Nations \r\nas the anchor and the defence of the authority of the \r\nCharter and fundamental norms of international law.\r\nMr. Argüello González (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice for his \r\nreport (A/70/4) and introductory statement.\r\nNicaragua associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nAs is clear from the report before us, the number \r\nof cases before the International Court of Justice is \r\nincreasing every year, thereby reflecting the confidence \r\nthat Member States place in the Court, the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. That trust has \r\nbeen a constant factor notwithstanding the growing \r\nnumber of international tribunals established over the \r\npast decades, and reaffirms the f lagship role played \r\nby the Court in the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\nIt is for those reasons that Nicaragua is pleased that, \r\nsince the last reporting period, two additional States \r\nhave joined in recognizing the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the Court, in accordance with the Statute of the \r\nCourt. However, it also notes that 72 such declarations \r\nrepresent a relatively small number as compared with \r\nthe 193 States Members of the Organization.\r\nIn its own particular case, Nicaragua, a small \r\ndeveloping country that depends on respect for \r\ninternational law to protect its national interests, has \r\nturned to the Court on several occasions. It has also \r\naccepted the jurisdiction of the Court whenever it has \r\nbeen a respondent and, while it does have a reservation, \r\nhas never invoked that reservation and is currently in \r\nthe process of withdrawing it.\r\nDuring 2015, Nicaragua has taken part in oral \r\nhearings in four separate cases. The Court has begun its \r\ndeliberation on the merits of two joined cases involving \r\ndisputes with the Republic of Costa Rica — Certain \r\nActivities carried out by Nicaragua in the Border \r\nArea (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and Construction \r\nof a Road in Costa Rica along the San Juan River \r\n(Nicaragua v. Costa Rica) — and in two other cases in \r\ndeliberation in which preliminary objections have been \r\nraised by Colombia concerning the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt — Question of the Delimitation of the Continental \r\nShelf between Nicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 \r\nnautical miles from the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua \r\nv. Colombia) and Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights \r\nand Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua \r\nv. Colombia).\r\nNicaragua takes this opportunity to reiterate that it \r\nhas faithfully fulfilled its international obligations in \r\nevery case to which it has been party, and that it expects \r\nreciprocity in the fulfilment of the obligation to abide \r\nby the judgments of the International Court of Justice \r\nin cases to which it is party, while stressing that the \r\nexistence of a dispute does not justify the use of force \r\nor threat of force by any of the States parties to the \r\ndispute. It is also important to note that, in contentious \r\nproceedings registered in the Central Registry of \r\nthe Court, five States in the Americas — all Latin \r\nAmerican countries — are parties to these proceedings, \r\nwhich is the highest number of participants from the \r\nsame continent.\r\nIn terms of resources, the first thing to note is that \r\nthe Court has the smallest budget of all the principal \r\norgans of the United Nations system, and yet has been \r\nthe most effective in preventing wars. It is also the most \r\ncost-effective body of the international judicial system. \r\n14/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nIts costs have remained low despite its increased \r\nworkload, as reflected in both the number of pending \r\ncases — 12 cases at the moment —and the increasing \r\nsubstantive complexity of the cases before the Court, \r\nwhich require highly specialized technical advice.\r\nSimilarly, Nicaragua notes with satisfaction the \r\nnew technical facilities available to parties for oral \r\nhearings and the constant support provided by the \r\nSecretariat for that purpose. Nicaragua, as a State \r\nparty in several cases, knows at first hand the financial \r\nchallenges that sometimes require the Court to charge \r\nthe parties for the costs of certain procedures, such \r\nas translations, which is onerous for less aff luent \r\ncountries. Accordingly, Nicaragua urges Member \r\nStates to consider those aspects in their discussions \r\nin the Fifth Committee and to provide this main organ \r\nwith the financial and technical support it needs to \r\nresolve the complex disputes that are submitted to it.\r\nLikewise, Member States are urged to contribute \r\nto the Secretary-General’s Trust Fund to Assist States \r\nin the Settlement of Disputes through the International \r\nCourt of Justice. The development and strengthening \r\nof friendly relations among States are enhanced when \r\ndisputes are permanently resolved by the means \r\nprovided by international law, of which the Court, the \r\nOrganization’s principal judiciary organ, is one of the \r\nmost respected institutions.\r\nFinally, it is worth noting, as the President of the \r\nCourt has said in other forums, that the Assembly can \r\nmake better use of its powers to request advisory opinions \r\nof the Court, and thereby support the development of \r\ninternational law and strengthen respect for the rule of \r\nlaw internationally.\r\nWe again welcome the submission of the report of \r\nthe Court and look forward to actively participating in \r\nthe celebrations of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nCourt, scheduled for April 2016. Those celebrations \r\nwill provide a unique opportunity for States that have \r\nnot yet done so to accept the compulsory jurisdiction \r\nof the Court under the Statute or withdraw their \r\nreservations. The celebrations will be even more \r\nmeaningful if a record number of countries accept the \r\nCourt’s compulsory jurisdiction.\r\nMr. Galea (Romania) (spoke in French): I wish to \r\nexpress my most sincere congratulations to President \r\nRonny Abraham on his election as President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as well as to express \r\nmy country‘s deep appreciation for the report (A/70/4) \r\nof the Court. As is the case every year, it is thorough, \r\ncomprehensive and substantive.\r\nIn the period covered by the report, we witnessed an \r\nexpansion in the Court’s substantive jurisdiction and an \r\nincrease in the complexity of the matters before it. On \r\n3 February 2015, the Court delivered its judgment in the \r\ncase Application of the Convention on the Prevention \r\nand Punishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. \r\nSerbia). The judgment gave the Court an opportunity \r\nto provide a clarification of the concept of genocide, \r\nciting the preparatory work of the Convention to \r\nemphasize the distinction between “physical” genocide \r\nand “cultural” genocide. The decision also provides \r\nan interesting view of the application of logic as well \r\nas the presumption of non-retroactivity, as set forth \r\nin article 28 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of \r\nTreaties. While that presumption applies to substantive \r\nobligations, including the obligation to prevent \r\ngenocide, this logical obstacle does not exist in relation \r\nto the treaty obligation to punish acts perpetrated before \r\nthe treaty entered into force.\r\nThe case concerning Questions relating to the \r\nSeizure and Detention of Certain Documents and \r\nData (Timor-Leste v. Australia) was removed from \r\nthe Court’s list, following the applicant’s withdrawal \r\nwhen the parties reached an amicable settlement. The \r\ncase had offered the Court a new area to explore in \r\nthe evolution of contemporary international relations. \r\nMeanwhile, in its judgment of 24 September 2015 \r\non the preliminary objections in the case concerning \r\nObligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean \r\n(Bolivia v. Chile), the Court recalled the reference \r\npoints in relation to the concept of the object of a \r\ndispute, whose definition is given by the Court itself. \r\nThe broad spectrum of matters on the Court’s docket at \r\npresent, including maritime delimitations and nuclear \r\ndisarmament, demonstrates the increased interest of \r\nStates in the settlement of disputes through the Court.\r\nRomania strongly supports the International Court \r\nof Justice. Our country is convinced that the Court \r\nhas an essential role to play in international relations \r\nfor the promotion of the rule of law internationally \r\nand to ensure the supremacy of international law. For \r\nRomania, international law represents something of \r\nvalue for the international community, and it is a pillar \r\nof our foreign policy.\r\nThe year 2015 has marked a milestone for my \r\ncountry in its relationship with the International Court \r\n15-35218 15/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nof Justice. After actively participating in the life of the \r\nCourt, including in the contentious case concerning \r\nMaritime Delimitation in the Black Sea (Romania \r\nv. Ukraine), Romania deposited with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, on 23 June 2015, its declaration accepting \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the International Court \r\nof Justice, thus becoming the seventy-second State to \r\naccept that obligation.That decision was the end point \r\nof a complex process that started in 2012. The Ministry \r\nfor Foreign Affairs led a complex public and academic \r\ndebate, while a detailed analysis of the consequences \r\nof such a declaration was undertaken. The public \r\ndebate showed broad support for the initiative among \r\nthe political forces, authorities, experts in international \r\npublic law and the general public.\r\nFollowing the public and inter-institutional debate, \r\nsome reservations or limitations were proposed.\r\nIn order to confer greater domestic legitimacy on \r\nthat decision, a law was adopted by Parliament and \r\nsigned by the President of Romania. The acceptance of \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction confirms Romania’s full trust \r\nin the International Court of Justice and its efforts to \r\nstrengthen the rule of law at the international level. \r\nThe declaration is proof that my country is committed \r\nto conducting its foreign relations in accordance with \r\ninternational law and that it is prepared to settle any \r\ndisputes in a peaceful manner in accordance with the \r\nlaw.\r\nAllow me to conclude by expressing my belief that \r\nthe Court will continue to develop its activity and to \r\nrepresent the highest standard of professionalism and \r\nimpartiality.\r\nMs. Butts (United States of America): The United \r\nStates would like to congratulate President Abraham \r\non his election to the presidency of the International \r\nCourt of Justice earlier this year. We also congratulate \r\nJudges Joan Donoghue and Mohamed Bennouna on \r\ntheir re-elections, and Judges James Crawford, Kirill \r\nGevorgian and Patrick Robinson on their elections as \r\nnew members of the Court. We would like to thank \r\nPresident Abraham for his leadership of the Court over \r\nmuch of the past year and for his recent report (A/70/4) \r\nregarding the activities of the Court between August \r\n2014 and July 2015.\r\nIn reviewing the report, we are again struck by \r\nhow productive the Court has continued to be over the \r\ncourse of a year. The Court issued one judgment and \r\nnine orders and held public hearings in two cases. In \r\naddition, the Court remained seized of a number of \r\nother matters, with a total of 12 cases on its list. We \r\ncommend the Court’s increasing ability to respond \r\npromptly and efficiently to the requests put before it, \r\nparticularly in the light of its growing caseload as well \r\nas the growing factual and legal complexity of its cases, \r\nand we appreciate that the Court has set a particularly \r\ndemanding schedule of hearings and deliberations \r\nfor itself. We believe those efforts will continue to \r\nbolster confidence in the Court and often provide \r\nStates with an opportunity to resolve disputes before \r\nthey escalate. This year, as in years past, the Court \r\nhas taken up a considerable range of topics, including \r\ngenocide, boundary disputes, the use of force and the \r\ninterpretation of international agreements. It is as a \r\nresult of such efforts that we continue to see States turn \r\nto the Court to resolve their disputes peacefully.\r\nWe also wish to remark on the Court’s continued \r\npublic outreach to educate key sectors of society, \r\nincluding law professors, students, judicial and \r\nGovernment officials and the general public, to increase \r\nunderstanding of the Court and its work. We appreciate \r\nthe efforts that the Court has made to increase \r\naccessibility and transparency, including by making its \r\nrecordings available to watch live on demand on United \r\nNations Web TV. All those efforts complement United \r\nNations efforts to promote the rule of law globally and \r\nto promote better public understanding of international \r\nlaw.\r\nAs we approach the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe Court’s inaugural session at the Peace Palace, we \r\nhave a unique opportunity to reflect on the Court’s \r\nimportant role and on the impressive jurisprudence \r\nit has developed. The International Court of Justice \r\nwas established under Article 92 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nOrganization and, in its nearly seven decades of work \r\nsince then, it has contributed immeasurably to the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and to the development \r\nand understanding of international law. The Preamble \r\nto the Charter underscores the determination of its \r\ndrafters to establish the conditions under which justice \r\nand respect for the obligations arising from treaties and \r\nother sources of international law can be maintained. \r\nThat essential goal lies at the core of the Charter system, \r\nand in particular of the Court.\r\nThe United States is pleased to join others today \r\nin celebrating and applauding nearly 70 years of the \r\nCourt’s work.\r\n16/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nMr. Alday González (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Mexico would like to express its \r\ndeep appreciation to the International Court of Justice \r\nfor its arduous work over the past year, which was just \r\ndescribed by its President, Judge Ronny Abraham. \r\nAt the same time, Mexico welcomes the Court’s \r\nrenewal during the reporting period, which reaffirms \r\nits universal character and ensures that its decisions \r\nwill be adopted with respect for the principal judicial \r\nsystems and the multiplicity of regional perspectives \r\nand realities. All of that will help to ensure that the \r\nhighest international judicial organ will continue the \r\nexcellent work that has characterized it during its first \r\n70 years.\r\nMexico would like to recognize the judges, who \r\nperformed their task in the most exemplary manner, \r\nthereby creating an enduring legacy for the Court and \r\nfor international justice. We would like to acknowledge \r\nin particular the work of Judges Leonid Skotnikov, \r\nKenneth Keith and Bernardo Sepúlveda Amor. The \r\ndedication and knowledge that Judge Sepúlveda Amor \r\nbrought to his service with the Court are a source of \r\ngreat pride for Mexico.\r\nThe Court’s intense activity during recent years \r\nbears out the trust that the international community \r\nhas placed in it as the ideal mechanism for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. The consolidation of the Court \r\nis evident from its universal mission, with States \r\nemploying the full range of procedural measures \r\nprovided for in its Statute, and from the breadth of the \r\nsubstantive issues represented in the disputes that have \r\nbeen brought before it. There can be no doubt that the \r\nInternational Court of Justice plays a crucial role in the \r\npromotion and applicability of the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level. The existence of efficient judicial \r\nmechanisms for the peaceful resolution of any disputes \r\nthat may arise in the application or interpretation of \r\ninternational law is essential to the very concept of \r\nthe rule of law. That leads to two fundamental points: \r\nthe need for more States to accept the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice, as \r\nprovided for by Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute, \r\nand the need for full compliance with the judgments \r\nissued by the Court.\r\nMexico would like to highlight the great legal value \r\nof the Court’s judgments, both for the parties to a case \r\nand for the international community as a whole, since \r\njurisprudence is an auxiliary source of key importance \r\nin determining the validity and content of norms. The \r\nCourt has an essential role to play in the development \r\nof international law, especially as the leading voice in \r\ndialogue with other legal organs, a role that enriches \r\ninternational law and helps prevent its fragmentation.\r\nFrom the point of view of procedural law, the work \r\nof the Court has become more complicated because \r\nStates now increasingly use all the alternatives and \r\nprocedures provided for in the Statute, such as the \r\nrequest for provisional measures and the interpretation \r\nof judgments whose determination by the Court are of \r\nprimary importance to avoid the escalation of disputes \r\nor the emergence of new ones. In addition, from the \r\nperspective of substantive law, the International Court \r\nof Justice acts to settle disputes that arise on very \r\ndiverse issues and reflect its genuinely broad-based \r\ncharacter. In addition to territorial conflicts and those \r\npertaining to maritime boundaries, the Court hears \r\nquestions related to the treatment of nationals by other \r\nStates, charges of massive violations of human rights \r\nor of State responsibility for international crimes, and \r\nissues relating to the environment and the management \r\nof shared natural resources, among others.\r\nIn the period covered by the report, the Court \r\nresolved an issue that was of great legal complexity \r\nand political sensitivity. We hope that it will help to \r\nstrengthen peace in the region involved. The case \r\nis important because of the precedent that it sets for \r\njurisdictional limitations, in accordance with the scope \r\nof the optional clause based on which a dispute is \r\nsubmitted, the interpretation of the validity of treaties, \r\nin particular the presumption against the retroactive \r\napplication of treaties, the juridical scope in the case \r\nof States’ succession and, of course, the interpretation \r\nof the substantive provisions of the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide.\r\nMexico wishes to thank the General Assembly for \r\nits willingness to authorize new deadlines and other \r\nbudgetary requests for the Court and calls for it to \r\ncontinue providing the tools necessary to ensure that \r\nthe Court functions at optimal capacity as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the Organization. In addition to the \r\nadministrative improvements at the Court itself, there \r\nis no doubt that addressing the prolonged delays that \r\nexisted before has led to the commitment by States \r\nto providing increased human resources. In that \r\nregard, we wish to call for assurances that the Court \r\nhas sufficient resources for the celebration of its \r\nseventieth anniversary, in 2016. Mexico also wishes to \r\nexpress its sincere congratulations to the Registrar of \r\n15-35218 17/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nthe Court, Philippe Couvreur, on his recent election, \r\nwhich is undoubtedly because of his outstanding \r\nperformance in all three areas — legal, diplomatic and \r\nadministrative — of his work.\r\nI would like to conclude my statement by \r\nacknowledging the efforts of the International Court \r\nof Justice to provide as much transparency as possible \r\nin its work, particularly the considerable effort it made \r\nto improve its website. Through the site, it is possible \r\nto consult not only judgments and advisory opinions \r\nbut all the documents of the parties. That initiative \r\nis most valuable to all States and all those studying \r\ninternational law.\r\nMr. Plasai (Thailand): My delegation would like to \r\nexpress its appreciation to Judge Ronny Abraham for his \r\nable leadership as President of the International Court \r\nof Justice and for his comprehensive report (A/70/4) on \r\nthe activities of the Court over the past year.\r\nThe Court has continued to be very active. For \r\nthe present reporting period, the Court rendered one \r\njudgment, handed down nine orders, held several public \r\nhearings and was seized of new contentious cases. The \r\n12 cases that remain on the Court’s docket cover a wide \r\nrange of issues and involve States from every continent. \r\nWe appreciate the remarkable efforts made by the Court \r\nin efficiently managing these cases, which involve, in \r\nprocedural terms, many phases and, in substantive \r\nterms, growing factual and legal complexity.\r\nThe latest judgment of the Court, in the case \r\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and \r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. \r\nSerbia), rendered on 3 February, is a true milestone in \r\nthe development of international human rights law and \r\ninternational humanitarian law. Among other things, it \r\nprovides useful clarification of the terms of article 2 \r\nof the Convention, in particular regarding actus reus \r\nand dolus specialis of the crime of genocide. We also \r\ncommend the Court’s rigorous process in reaching \r\ndecisions, which contributes to increasing confidence \r\nin the Court and in the international dispute settlement \r\nsystem in general. As such, the Court has played a key \r\nrole in the peaceful settlement of inter-State disputes \r\nand in strengthening respect for the rule of law at \r\nthe international level, which are important to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAs the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, the Court plays a unique role in the progressive \r\ndevelopment of international law. Over the years, \r\nits impressive case law has brought greater clarity \r\nin different areas of international law. Thailand has \r\nfollowed with great interest the Court’s case law in the \r\nareas of border delimitation, maritime boundaries and \r\nthe interpretation of treaties and judgements, just to \r\nname a few. This year, we noted that a new case involving \r\neconomic rights was presented to the Court, which will \r\nfurther diversify the issues before it and underscore its \r\nrole as a court of general jurisdiction. We look forward \r\nto commemorating the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, in April 2016. It will be \r\nan excellent opportunity to celebrate and reflect on the \r\nwork done by the Court to date.\r\nIn conclusion, we welcome efforts to promote \r\ntransparency in the conduct of the work of the Court. \r\nFor years the Court has successfully used technology \r\nto facilitate access to information regarding its \r\nprocedures, rulings and judgments through recordings \r\nthat are broadcast live or on demand and online data \r\non case documentation. That has helped to significantly \r\nincrease understanding of international law and the \r\nwork of the Court.\r\nLet me conclude by expressing our gratitude to \r\nall the Judges, the Registrar and the Registry staff \r\nfor their dedication to the work of the Court and the \r\nmaintenance of peace, justice and the rule of law within \r\nthe international community.\r\nMr. Saeed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The Sudan \r\nassociates itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Iran, on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement, and the representative of South Africa, on \r\nbehalf of the African Group.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/70/327) and the report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice (A/70/4). We would also \r\nlike to thank the President of the Court, Mr. Ronny \r\nAbraham, for presenting the report on the activities \r\nof the Court during the most recent reporting period. \r\nConsidering that the International Court of Justice is \r\nthe principal judicial organ of the United Nations, my \r\ndelegation also wishes to thank the Court for the role it \r\nplays, as stipulated by the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nin enhancing the rule of law at the international level \r\nthrough its judgments and advisory opinions and its \r\n18/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\ncontribution to reinforcing the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes.\r\nThe role of the International Court of Justice is of \r\ncrucial importance, and it has a very heavy workload. \r\nThat requires Member States to provide further political \r\nsupport and additional financial resources so that it can \r\nfulfil its mandate. The annual report is an opportunity \r\nfor the General Assembly to reiterate the importance \r\nof the role of the Court and to support its activities. \r\nThe growing number of cases submitted to the Court \r\nreflects the trust we have in the Court and its ability \r\nto resolve disputes with integrity and impartiality and \r\nin a way that is acceptable to all the parties concerned. \r\nThe Sudan encourages the Court to adopt the necessary \r\nmeasures to render it more capable of shouldering its \r\nresponsibilities and settling disputes in a timely manner.\r\nMy delegation also calls on the General Assembly to \r\ninvite countries that have not recognized the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court to do so, thereby contributing \r\nto reinforcing the rule of law at the international level. \r\nIt would also enable the Court to fulfil its mandate as \r\ndefined by the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe Sudan also invites the Security Council, which \r\nhas not sought an advisory opinion from the Court since \r\n1970, to take advantage of the Court as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations and a source of \r\nadvisory opinions that shed light on the principles \r\nof international law. We also call upon the General \r\nAssembly and the United Nations specialized agencies \r\nto seek advisory opinions from the International \r\nCourt of Justice with regard to the interpretation of \r\ninternational legal principles that pertain to their \r\nrespective mandates.\r\nIn conclusion, the Sudan reiterates the importance \r\nof the role played by the International Court of Justice, \r\nand we express our support to the Court in the fulfilment \r\nof its mandate.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): At the outset, allow me to welcome \r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice and \r\nthe members of the Court who are present here today at \r\nthis meeting. The Plurinational State of Bolivia thanks \r\nthe International Court of Justice for its report (A/70/4) \r\ncovering the period from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015. \r\nWe also thank the President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, Judge Ronny Abraham, for presenting the \r\nreport to the Assembly.\r\nBolivia, as a peaceful State, abides by the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the principles on which \r\nthe International Court of Justice is established. Its \r\njurisdiction is a permanent call to dialogue between \r\nnations that are neighbours and sisters. The Court, its \r\nprinciples and its purposes open up new opportunities \r\nfor resolving our differences. The Plurinational State \r\nof Bolivia is convinced that the International Court \r\nof Justice is one of the best means for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes between States. Bolivia urges \r\nall States to honour in good faith the jurisdiction \r\nand judgments of the Court, in conformity with the \r\nprovisions of Charter of the United Nations. Bolivia \r\nalso requests that we uphold what is established in \r\nresolution 67/1, by which the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations reaffirmed their obligation to resolve \r\ndisputes through peaceful means, including through \r\njudicial settlement. In that same spirit, we wish to recall \r\nthe Manila Declaration on the Peaceful Settlement of \r\nInternational Disputes, which provides that recourse \r\nto judicial settlement does not imply an act of enmity \r\nbetween States.\r\nThe fact that the Court’s list includes contentious \r\ncases from across all continents, as the report states, \r\nis a clear demonstration of its universal jurisdiction \r\nand the recognition that it enjoys. The professionalism, \r\nindependence and integrity with which the judges of \r\nthe Court deliver their decisions, thereby justifying the \r\ntrust placed in the Court by the States members of the \r\nUnited Nations system, has enabled it to strengthen its \r\nmost important undertaking, which is to establish a \r\nuniversal court of justice for States.\r\nIt is also important for me to stress that the Bolivian \r\ndelegation supports the need to allocate adequate \r\nbudgetary resources for the functioning of the Court \r\nand to do so in a timely manner. We would like to \r\nunderscore the effort made by the Court to disseminate \r\nits achievements, especially as it prepares activities to \r\ncelebrate its seventieth anniversary, in April 2016.\r\nBolivia endorses the appeal made by the General \r\nAssembly, through resolution 69/123, which calls on \r\n“States that have not yet done so to consider accepting \r\nthe jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice in \r\naccordance with its Statute” (resolution 69/123, seventh \r\npreambular paragraph). Moreover, Bolivia also \r\nrespectfully urges States that currently recognize the \r\njurisdiction of the Court not to abandon the Court. They \r\nare sending signals that indicate a peaceful vocation \r\nand respect for international law, security and justice.\r\n15-35218 19/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nIn the case brought by the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia against the Republic of Chile, which was \r\nrecently accepted by the Court, as was stated already by \r\nPresident Evo Morales, we repeat that Bolivia envisages \r\nonly one way of resolving outstanding issues, namely, \r\nthrough negotiation and the peaceful means established \r\nby international law.\r\nFinally, Bolivia reaffirms and reiterates its \r\ncommitment to peace in the resolution of conflicts and \r\nreiterates its faithful attachment to the principles of \r\ninternational law and the provisions of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. It is not might that makes right; it is \r\nreasonable laws that right injustices.\r\nMr. Yoshikawa (Japan): I would like to start \r\nby thanking President Ronny Abraham of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for his leadership and the \r\ncomprehensive report (A/70/4) on the work of the Court. \r\nI am also grateful to the Netherlands for hosting a side \r\nevent on the Court with the presence of His Majesty \r\nKing Willem-Alexander on 29 September.\r\nThe Court was born in 1945, on the very same day \r\nas the United Nations, and began its work the following \r\nyear. The fact that the Statute of the International Court \r\nof Justice is an integral part of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and that the Court is the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations is a strong reminder of \r\nwhy the United Nations was established 70 years ago. \r\nThe United Nations was created to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to maintain \r\ninternational peace and stability through the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nThe Court is the only international court which has \r\nuniversal jurisdiction in terms of the number of States \r\nparties to the Statute of the Court and the diversity of \r\nthe subject matters it deals with. All questions of an \r\ninternational legal nature can be submitted to it. All \r\nStates Members of the United Nations are ipso facto \r\nparties to the Statute of the International Court of \r\nJustice. From 1947 until today, 161 cases have been \r\nentered in the General List of the Court and 149 cases \r\nhave been resolved. Those achievements demonstrate \r\nthat the Court has played a constructive role in the field \r\nof the peaceful settlement of international disputes for \r\nseven decades. It is not an overstatement to assert that \r\nthe path the Court has taken to date constitutes the core \r\nhistory of the promotion of the rule of law by the United \r\nNations in international relations. In that context, I \r\nwish to repeat the plea of my Government that more \r\nStates should recognize the compulsory jurisdiction of \r\nthe Court.\r\nOn the other hand, today the international \r\ncommunity enjoys the benefits of the remarkable \r\ndevelopment of various peaceful means of dispute \r\nsettlement other than the Court, such as the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea, arbitral \r\ntribunals, international investment tribunals and the \r\nWorld Trade Organization dispute-settlement system. \r\nJapan welcomes the current trend of States utilizing \r\nsuch peaceful means of dispute settlement, depending \r\non specific situations. We hope that the effectiveness \r\nof international law will be further strengthened in a \r\ncoherent manner.\r\nThe rule of law and peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes are fundamental principles of \r\nJapan’s foreign policy. In its bilateral relations with \r\nother Member States, Japan explores the possibilities of \r\npeacefully settling disputes through the International \r\nCourt of Justice. Japan not only abides by the Court’s \r\ndecisions in cases in which Japan was a party, but also \r\nrespects the jurisprudence of the Court in other cases. \r\nThat is because we adhere to the principle of the rule \r\nof law.\r\nMr. Remaoun (Algeria) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme to express our appreciation to the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Judge Ronny Abraham, \r\nfor his introduction of the exhaustive report on the \r\nactivities of the Court during the period from 1 August \r\n2014 to 31 July 2015 (A/70/4).\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the Permanent Representative of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of African States and by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe growing responsibility of the International \r\nCourt of Justice in promoting international peace \r\nand security is undeniable, particularly through the \r\nfulfilment of its mandate and its role in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, in conformity with the rules \r\nof international law and the principles of justice. \r\nIndeed, despite the establishment of many specialized \r\njurisdictions at the international and regional levels to \r\naddress many emerging issues, the International Court \r\nof Justice remains the only jurisdiction that enjoys \r\nuniversality. The Court has a unique position within the \r\n20/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\ninternational legal framework, given the fact that it was \r\nestablished by the Charter of the United Nations as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the Organization.\r\nThe Court’s work has grown significantly in factual \r\nand legal complexity throughout the years. The Court \r\nhas been entrusted with resolving many contentious \r\ncases from all over the world, involving a wide range \r\nof subjects, such as territorial and maritime disputes, \r\nenvironmental damage, violations of territorial \r\nintegrity, the right to self-determination of peoples \r\nunder foreign occupation, violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights, and many other \r\nmatters. Moreover, despite the increasing complexity of \r\nthe cases and the considerable growth of the workload \r\nof the Registry over the past 20 years, we commend the \r\nCourt for its efficient response to those new challenges. \r\nWe encourage the Court to pursue its efforts to further \r\nstrengthen measures already taken.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation reiterates its full \r\nsupport for the Court’s key role in ensuring the \r\nimplementation of the provisions of international law, \r\nadjudicating disputes between States and providing \r\nadvisory opinions to them and to international \r\norganizations on how best to assume their roles and \r\nfunctions. In that respect, we would like to emphasize \r\nthe importance for all States, without exception, to \r\nabide by their legal obligations and comply with the \r\ndecisions of the International Court of Justice in cases \r\nto which they are parties.\r\nIt is also important for the United Nations, \r\nparticularly the Security Council and the specialized \r\nagencies, to request advisory opinions on legal questions, \r\nwhen needed, from the International Court of Justice. \r\nThe high moral and legal value of the Court’s advisory \r\nopinions would certainly promote both international \r\npeace and security and the rule of law. As such, there is \r\nan urgent need for the international community to insist \r\non full compliance with the Court’s advisory opinions. \r\nIn that context, we strongly encourage respect for all \r\nadvisory opinions and legal provisions delivered by \r\nthe Court. Respect for international law will reinforce \r\nthe rule of law and thereby contribute to strengthening \r\nglobal peace and security.\r\nWe take this opportunity to recognize the key role \r\nplayed by the Court in maintaining and promoting the \r\nrule of law throughout the world. In fact, by fulfilling \r\nits two main functions, as mandated by the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, the International Court of \r\nJustice has contributed over the past seven decades \r\nto the development and codification of the rules of \r\ninternational law and consolidated the principles of \r\njustice and equality at the international level.\r\nFinally, my delegation commends all the efforts \r\nmade to date in that regard, and reaffirms its confidence \r\nin the Court’s ability to carry out its mission, using the \r\nsame meticulous and impartial methods with a high \r\nlevel of effectiveness.\r\nMr. Koch (Germany): As the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, the International Court of \r\nJustice makes a crucial contribution to the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security by ensuring that \r\ninternational disputes are settled by peaceful means \r\nand in accordance with international law. Germany \r\nreaffirms its strong support for the Court. In our \r\nview, two aspects are of special importance if we are \r\nto preserve the role of the Court and to enhance its \r\ncontribution to the peaceful solution of international \r\ndisputes even further.\r\nFirst, with regard to compliance, as States Members \r\nof the United Nations it is in our common interest to \r\npreserve the premise underlying the very idea of the \r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes by judicial \r\nmeans, namely, the obligations of the parties to a dispute \r\nto implement the judgements delivered by a competent \r\njudicial organ, in particular by the International Court \r\nof Justice. \r\nUnfortunately, compliance is still far from \r\nuniversal. We must all be very clear in that regard. \r\nCompliance with the decisions of international courts \r\nand tribunals is not a question of courtesy; it is a legal \r\nobligation incumbent on the parties. In the case of \r\nthe International Court of Justice, that obligation is \r\nunequivocally stipulated in paragraph 1 of Article 94 \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations itself. It is a long-\r\nestablished principle of public international law that \r\ndomestic law must be adapted to a State’s obligations \r\nderiving from international law and cannot provide any \r\njustification for violating the latter.\r\nSecondly, on the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt, in our view one of the best ways for any State to \r\nfoster the peaceful settlement of international disputes \r\nby judicial means is by recognizing the jurisdiction of \r\nthe International Court of Justice as compulsory by \r\nmaking a declaration to that effect under paragraph \r\n2 of article 36 of the Court’s Statute. Germany made \r\nsuch a declaration in 2008. Unfortunately, as of today, \r\n15-35218 21/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nonly 72 declarations are in force. Many States Members \r\nof the United Nations thus still do not recognize the \r\njurisdiction of the International Court of Justice as \r\ncompulsory.\r\nI call on those States to do their part to help the \r\nInternational Court of Justice perform its important \r\nfunctions in the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes yet more effectively.\r\nMr. Alabrune (France) (spoke in French): \r\nThe delegation of France wishes to thank President \r\nAbraham for his very informative, complete and clear \r\nintroduction of the annual report (A/70/4) on the \r\nactivities of the International Court of Justice for the \r\njudicial year that just ended.\r\nAs highlighted in the list of cases on the docket \r\nof the Court, its litigation activity has increased \r\nremarkably over the past 20 years, demonstrating \r\nboth the confidence of States in the institution of the \r\nCourt and its role as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations in the search for the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes and strengthening the rule of law. At least \r\n12 legal proceedings pending before the Court attest to \r\nthat, as does the fact that over the past year, the Court \r\nhas delivered two judgments — one on the merits and \r\nthe other on preliminary objections — and eight rulings.\r\nWhile the judgments and orders delivered by the \r\nCourt are binding on the parties by dint of the authority \r\non the subject under review, States’ respect for and due \r\nenforcement also reflect the high quality of the Court’s \r\ndecisions. The judgments and rulings of the Court may \r\nthus contribute to easing political tensions and help \r\nStates to find a solution that other peaceful means for \r\nthe settlement of disputes do not provide.\r\nThe past year was marked by the re-election of one \r\nthird of the Judges of the Court. In that regard, we offer \r\nour very warm congratulations to its new members. \r\nThe French delegation also wishes to welcome the \r\nelection of Judge Ronny Abraham to the position of \r\nPresident of the Court. The French delegation recalls \r\nthat, as emphasized by President Abraham, the use \r\nof two languages, English and French, in the work of \r\nthe Court helps to improve the quality and precision \r\nof the jurisprudence of the Court. It should be stressed \r\nthat it is languages that actually ensure balance among \r\nthe different juridical systems participating in the \r\nformation of international law.\r\nI take this opportunity, on behalf of France, to \r\nagain offer the members of the Court, the Registrar and \r\nall its staff our profound gratitude for the work carried \r\nthis year, the seventieth anniversary year of the Court, \r\nwhich this year again bears testimony to its sustained \r\nand effective activity, executed, as we know, with \r\nlimited means.\r\nMr. Pírez Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba associates itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the countries of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe Republic of Cuba thanks President Ronny \r\nAbraham for introducing the report on the International \r\nCourt of Justice (A/70/4). We also wish at this rostrum \r\nto express our commitment to the strict application \r\nof international law and the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes.\r\nMy delegation has recognized the work of the \r\nCourt since its inception. Its decisions and advisory \r\nopinions have been of particular importance not only to \r\nthe cases submitted for its consideration but also to the \r\ndevelopment of international law. The volume of cases \r\nunder the consideration of that forum, many of which \r\nrelate to Latin America and the Caribbean, demonstrate \r\nthe importance that the international community \r\nattaches to the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThe Republic of Cuba favours the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, in accordance with paragraph 1 \r\nof Article 33 of the Charter, and has declared its prior \r\nconsent to the jurisdiction of the International Court \r\nof Justice. Cuba regrets the failure of some Court \r\ndecisions to be executed, in clear violation of Article 94 \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, which establishes \r\nthat every Member of the United Nations undertakes to \r\ncomply with the decision of the International Court of \r\nJustice in any case to which it is a party. \r\nIn that regard, the Republic of Cuba notes with \r\nconcern that the effectiveness and enforceability of the \r\nCourt’s decisions can be subject to reasonable criticism \r\nwhen certain countries do not recognize judgments \r\nunfavourable to themselves. Unfortunately, the refusal \r\nof these States to comply with the decisions handed \r\ndown and their obstruction of the United Nations \r\nmechanisms to enforce the judgments, such as resort \r\nto the privilege of the veto in the Security Council, \r\ndemonstrate the f laws in the mechanisms of the Court \r\nto execute its decisions. This demonstrates that the \r\nnecessity of reforming the United Nations system, in \r\n22/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\norder to give developing countries greater assurances \r\nvis-à-vis more powerful nations, also applies to the seat \r\nof the International Court of Justice. My delegation \r\nbelieves that it would be helpful for the Court to conduct \r\na critical evaluation of its relationship to the organs of \r\nthe United Nations generally and the Security Council \r\nin particular.\r\nThe International Court of Justice has handled many \r\nsignificant cases, and Cuba considers the unanimous \r\nadvisory opinion of 8 July 1996 on the legality of \r\nthe threat or use of nuclear weapons to be extremely \r\nimportant. In its opinion, the Court concluded that an \r\nobligation exists to pursue in good faith and bring to \r\na conclusion negotiations aimed at achieving nuclear \r\ndisarmament in all its aspects through strict and effective \r\ninternational controls. In that context, and as others \r\nhave done before us, Cuba urges full acknowledgement \r\nof the Court’s advisory opinion of 9 July 2004 on the \r\nlegal consequences of the construction of a wall in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, and calls on all States to \r\nrespect and ensure respect for the Court’s provisions on \r\nthat important matter.\r\nCuba considers it very important that the International \r\nCourt of Justice be allocated sufficient budgetary \r\nresources to enable it to properly carry out its work of \r\nsettling the disputes under its jurisdiction by peaceful \r\nmeans, and we have urged that we work to ensure that \r\nthe Court receives appropriate resources in a timely \r\nfashion. The Republic of Cuba is grateful to the Court \r\nfor the publications it makes available to Governments \r\nand for its online resources, which are valuable for \r\nstudying and disseminating international public law, \r\nparticularly for developing countries, which are often \r\ndenied information related to advances in international \r\nlaw owing to obsolete and ridiculous embargo policies \r\nthat have been overwhelmingly rejected by the \r\ninternational community.\r\nCuba is a peaceful country that respects international \r\nlaw, and it has always faithfully met its international \r\nobligations arising from treaties to which it is party. \r\nWe wish to take this opportunity to reiterate our \r\ncommitment to peace. Th events of recent years \r\nhave been irrefutable evidence of the importance of \r\nthe International Court of Justice as an international \r\nbody for settling disputes of major significance to the \r\ninternational community peacefully, in good faith and \r\nin accordance with international law.\r\nMr. Troncoso Repetto (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, my delegation would like to express its \r\nappreciation for the report (A/70/4) of the President \r\nof the International Court of Justice, Judge Ronny \r\nAbraham, on the work of the Court during the past \r\nyear. It shows that during the reporting period the \r\nCourt accomplished a great deal on issues raised by a \r\nnumber of States, particularly concerning incidental \r\nproceedings and new applications. We also carefully \r\nstudied the judgment handed down in the case \r\nconcerning the Application of the Convention on the \r\nPrevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide \r\n(Croatia v. Serbia).\r\nIn keeping with the provisions of its Statute, the \r\nCourt exercises jurisdiction over cases referred to it \r\nunder terms recognized by the States and in accordance \r\nwith the principle of voluntary jurisdiction. In exercising \r\nthat jurisdiction, the Court applies international \r\nlaw as indicated in article 38 of the Statute, which \r\nsees international conventions as the heart of States’ \r\nexpression of their will and as a fundamental pillar of \r\ninternational relations, a pillar also recognized in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations itself.\r\nAmong the core principles guiding Chile’s foreign \r\npolicy, articulated in multiple forums and instruments, is \r\nthe principle of the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes. Another of our basic foreign-policy principles \r\nis the essential role of respect for international treaties \r\nas the foundation that peaceful, stable and cooperative \r\nrelations among States are built on. The importance that \r\nmy country attaches to treaties is particularly applicable \r\nto those that establish borders between States. Ensuring \r\nthat they are strictly observed and remain stable over \r\ntime is a prerequisite for peaceful relations between \r\nnations. They cannot be revised through unilateral \r\nactions, nor can their revision be imposed on a State.\r\nWe have recently been apprised of the Court’s \r\njudgment on Chile’s preliminary objection raised in \r\nthe case before the Court concerning the Obligation to \r\nNegotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean (Bolivia v. Chile). \r\nIn the judgment, the Court ruled that, even assuming \r\nthat the existence of an obligation to negotiate were \r\nto be established, a matter that would be the subject \r\nof proceedings on the merits, it would not be for the \r\nCourt to predetermine the outcome of any negotiation \r\nthat would take place in consequence of that obligation. \r\nFurthermore, the freedom of the parties to initiate \r\nnegotiations cannot be limited by alleged obligations \r\nthat are devoid of any legal substance.\r\n15-35218 23/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nConsidering the Court’s role as the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations and its wide-ranging \r\nmission both in contentious cases and in the framework \r\nof advisory opinions, my delegation would like to once \r\nagain express its support for the importance of having at \r\nits disposal a complete version of the Court’s judgments \r\nand advisory opinions in Spanish, which will enhance \r\nawareness of its rulings and ultimately contribute to the \r\ndissemination of international law in the broadest sense \r\nand adding to efforts that have already been made in \r\nthat regard.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nPeru is grateful for the introduction by Judge Ronny \r\nAbraham, President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, of the Court’s annual report for the period from \r\n1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015 (A/70/4).\r\nI would like to begin my statement by emphasizing \r\nthe fundamental role played in the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes by the International Court of Justice, as \r\nthe principal judicial body of the United Nations and \r\nas established in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIts work is an essential contribution to the promotion \r\nof the rule of law at the international level. We also \r\nnote that besides that valuable function, in accordance \r\nwith Article 96 of the Charter, the Court’s advisory \r\nopinion may be requested by the General Assembly, \r\nthe Security Council and other organs and specialized \r\nagencies of the United Nations. Those are the two areas \r\ncovered by the International Court of Justice. Through \r\nits judgments and opinions, it helps to promote and \r\nclarify international law as a true pathway to peace. \r\nFor all those reasons, Peru would like to point out that \r\nthe General Assembly has once again urged States \r\nthat have not yet done so to consider the possibility \r\nof recognizing the Court’s jurisdiction, in accordance \r\nwith paragraph 2 of article 36 of its Statute.\r\nHaving said this, Peru would like to recognize the \r\nwork carried out by the eminent judges of the Court, in \r\nparticular the President and Vice-President, as well as \r\nthe ad hoc judges. By the same token, we would like to \r\nput on record our gratitude for the considerable work \r\ncarried out by the Registry of the Court, in particular \r\nby the Registrar and Deputy Registrar. \r\nThe sustained level of work of the International \r\nCourt of Justice is an expression of the prestige enjoyed \r\nby that principal judicial organ of the United Nations. \r\nIndeed, thanks to the Court’s efforts, Peru has been able \r\nto peacefully resolve its last outstanding border issue. \r\nThe Court’s high level of work can be explained, inter \r\nalia, by the significant number of measures adopted in \r\nrecent years to increase its effectiveness and allow it \r\nto absorb the ongoing increase in workload, including \r\nthrough a speedier processing of the increasing judicial \r\nproceedings.\r\nPeru welcomes the Court’s decision to celebrate \r\nits seventieth anniversary through various events, \r\nespecially in April 2016, which my delegation and \r\nespecially our Embassy in The Hague fully support. \r\nWe would also like to commend the host country of the \r\nCourt, the Netherlands, for its constant commitment and \r\nsupport to the work of the Court and to strengthening \r\nits cooperation with the principal organs in New \r\nYork. In that connection, my delegation followed with \r\ninterest the visit to the Court, in August 2014, by the \r\nrepresentatives of States members of the Security \r\nCouncil. We believe that such visits can be important \r\nfor ensuring a good relationship between the Court and \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nIn reaffirming our recognition of the Court for \r\nthe contribution it has made and continues to make \r\nto the peaceful settlement of disputes among States, I \r\nshould like to take advantage of this historic seventieth \r\nsession to pay tribute to José Luis Bustamante y \r\nRivero, Peruvian jurist and diplomat, former President \r\nof Peru and former President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, who also directly contributed to the \r\nachievement of its noble goals.\r\nMs. Hioureas (Cyprus): It is with particular \r\nhonour and pleasure that the Republic of Cyprus \r\naddresses the General Assembly today with regard to \r\nthe report (A/70/4) of the International Court of Justice. \r\nThe Republic of Cyprus attaches great importance to \r\nthe role and work of the International Court of Justice \r\nand to the settlement of disputes by peaceful means \r\nin conformity with justice and international law, as \r\nprovided for in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThis occasion offers us the opportunity to commend \r\nthe Court on its significant work and to pay tribute and \r\nconvey our respect to President Judge Ronny Abraham \r\nand its members, who serve the Court with dedication \r\nand distinction. We are, once again, grateful to the \r\nPresident for his introduction of the report and for his \r\ninsightful remarks on the work and functioning of the \r\nCourt.\r\nIn the role of the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, the work of the International Court of \r\n24/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nJustice bears utmost importance for the promotion of \r\nthe rule of law, for friendly relations among States and \r\nfor international peace and security. This role can be \r\nbest achieved through the universal acceptance of the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court, as recommended \r\nby resolution 69/123.\r\nThe Court’s jurisdiction over disputes has \r\ninfluenced and shaped international law through \r\nthe peaceful resolution of disputes. With trust in the \r\nCourt’s capacity to deliver justice, in 2002 the Republic \r\nof Cyprus made a declaration for the recognition \r\nof compulsory jurisdiction. To date, we are one of \r\n72 countries in the world that have done so. We call \r\nupon States to recognize the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nin accordance with the article 36 of the Statute, thereby \r\npromoting and facilitating the International Court of \r\nJustice’s ability to maintain and promote the rule of law \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIt is now widely recognized that the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes within the framework of the \r\nCharter requires an integrated and coordinated \r\napproach, combining more than one category of \r\nstrategies of dispute resolution. A welcome development \r\nin that regard is the continued and increased recourse to \r\nthe International Court of Justice, in parallel with other \r\nmethods of dispute resolution, thereby emphasizing \r\nthe role of the Court in the United Nations system for \r\nthe maintenance of peace and security. In particular, \r\nthe decisions of the International Court of Justice have \r\ncontributed significantly to the development of the law \r\nof the sea, which is of particular importance to the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus.\r\nOur delegation underscores the steps taken by \r\nthe Court to enhance its efficiency in handling cases. \r\nEffective management is pivotal, considering the \r\nCourt’s increased caseload. We are pleased to note that \r\nthe 12 cases currently entered in the Court’s list ref lect \r\nthe geographic diversity. The cases come from various \r\nregions of the world and cover diverse international law \r\nsubjects. We would like to briefly address key cases of \r\nthe Court during the past year. Of particular importance \r\nare the current contentious proceedings relating \r\nto issues of sovereignty over disputed territories, \r\ninternational law obligations to negotiate in good faith \r\nand maritime delimitation disputes.\r\nThe ruling in the case of Certain Activities carried \r\nout by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa Rica v. \r\nNicaragua) is of importance as the issue before the \r\nCourt is to adjudge upon the sovereignty of the disputed \r\nterritory and territorial integrity. The pronouncements \r\nof the International Court of Justice relating to issues \r\nof occupation and territorial integrity are central \r\nto international peace and security. Moreover, the \r\ndevelopments in cases centred on an obligation to \r\nnegotiate are also important.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating the support \r\nof Cyprus for the work of the International Court \r\nof Justice and expressing gratitude for its role in \r\npromoting the rule of law and its active role in shaping \r\ninternational law.\r\nMs. Yparraguirre (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nwould like to thank President Ronny Abraham and \r\nthe entire team at The Hague for their comprehensive \r\nreport on the work of the International Court of Justice \r\nin the past year (A/70/4).\r\nWe subscribe to the statement of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement delivered by the representative of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran.\r\nThe world Court peacefully resolves sovereign \r\ndisputes that cannot otherwise be resolved by or \r\nthrough the political organs of the United Nations. As \r\nwe commemorate this year the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the United Nations, its principal judicial organ \r\ncontinues to play a vital role in supporting peace and \r\nsecurity, human rights and development, not through \r\narmies, but through the rule of law.\r\nThree years ago, we affirmed the Court’s essential \r\ncontribution to the rule of law in paragraph 31 of our \r\nlandmark consensus declaration of the high-level \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly on the rule of law at \r\nthe national and international levels (resolution 67/1). \r\nThe Philippines today reaffirms both its support for that \r\ndeclaration and its duty to comply with the decisions of \r\nthe Court in contentious cases. We renew our call on \r\nMember States that have not yet done so to accept the \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nIn the period under review, the Court was seized of \r\n12 cases. The gamut of subjects covered the big issues \r\nof our time, attesting to the Court’s stature as the only \r\ninternational court of a universal character with general \r\njurisdiction. Those include territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes; unlawful use of force; interference in the \r\ndomestic affairs of States; the violation of territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty; economic rights; international \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law; genocide and \r\n15-35218 25/26\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.47\r\nenvironmental damage to and conservation of living \r\nresources. The sovereign parties in these cases come \r\nfrom all over the world. Almost half of the cases are \r\nfrom the Americas and a third are from Africa. Their \r\nexample contributes to the progressive development of \r\ninternational law and encourages the rest of us to put \r\nour trust in international adjudication, including by the \r\nCourt.\r\nArticle 1, paragraph 1 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations reminds us of our primary duty\r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \r\npeace”.\r\nThat is the rationale for the 1982 Manila Declaration \r\non the Peaceful Settlement of International Disputes \r\n(resolution 37/10, annex). To this day, many delegations \r\nrecognize the Declaration as a major achievement of the \r\nSpecial Committee on the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand on the Strengthening of the Role of the Organization. \r\nThe Manila Declaration was negotiated and adopted \r\nby the General Assembly during the Cold War, when \r\nmany non-aligned countries were consolidating their \r\npolitical and economic independence. It supported their \r\naspirations by articulating the norms of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, as outlined in Chapter VI of the \r\nCharter.\r\nTo illustrate our point, between 1947, when the \r\nCourt began considering its first contentious case, the \r\nCorfu Channel case, and the adoption in 1982 of the \r\nManila Declaration — a span of 35 years — it dealt \r\nwith fewer than 50 contentious cases. Since then, in a \r\nshorter period of time, its caseload has increased and \r\nit has taken on more than 80 contentious cases. The \r\ngrowing confidence of Member States, especially \r\ndeveloping countries, in the Court’s capabilities, \r\ncredibility and impartiality in the settlement of disputes \r\nby peaceful means is not unrelated to the norms, values \r\nand aspirations articulated in the Manila Declaration, \r\nof which the most fundamental is the non-use or threat \r\nof use of force. The Manila Declaration reflects the \r\ninternational community’s increasing reliance on the \r\nrule of law as a cornerstone not only of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, but also for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThe Philippines would like to reiterate that only \r\nthrough the rule of law in international relations can \r\nwe guarantee the respect, order and stability that we, \r\nthe peoples of the United Nations, seek. We believe \r\nthat contemporary international legal architecture has \r\nstrengthened the Court as the only forum for resolving \r\njusticiable disputes between States related to the vast \r\nfield of general international law. If there is anything \r\nthat the Charter of the United Nations and the Statute, \r\njurisprudence and experience of the Court can all teach \r\nus, it is that small nations should have no fear of the \r\nbig Powers if their cause is just, and that through the \r\nwork of the Court and other international courts and \r\ntribunals, including arbitral tribunals, the rule of law in \r\ninternational relations has a chance to prevail.\r\nIn closing, we reiterate our call on the Security \r\nCouncil to consider Article 96 of the Charter more \r\nseriously and to make greater use of the Court as a \r\nsource of advisory opinions and of interpretation of \r\nthe relevant norms of international law, particularly \r\non the most current and controversial issues affecting \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMr. Sarki (Nigeria): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident for convening this important meeting to \r\nconsider the report of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/70/4). Nigeria is grateful to Judge Ronny Abraham, \r\nthe President of the Court, for his comprehensive \r\nbriefing and remarks. We also congratulate him on his \r\nelection in February to the presidency of the Court.\r\nNigeria aligns itself with the statements delivered \r\nearlier today by the Permanent Representative of South \r\nAfrica, on behalf of the Group of African States, and \r\nby the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, on \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nNigeria maintains a special relationship with the \r\nInternational Court of Justice. Three of our eminent \r\njurists and statesmen have served as members of the \r\nCourt in previous years. We have also had occasion \r\nto defer to the Court’s ruling on matters related to \r\nour border differences with a neighbouring State. We \r\ntherefore believe that the Court has a central place \r\nin the administration of international justice and in \r\npromoting the rule of law, and respect for the rule of \r\nlaw, at the international level. We also believe that its \r\nrulings enhance the sovereignty of States.\r\nWe have studied the Court’s report covering the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015 and have \r\ntaken note of the Court’s activities during the reporting \r\nperiod. We believe it provides insights into the essential \r\nworking methods of the Court. We commend the Court \r\n26/26 15-35218\r\nA/70/PV.47 05/11/2015\r\nfor the measures it has taken in recent years to enhance \r\nits efficiency, facilitating effective management of its \r\nsteadily increasing workload. The number of cases \r\nadjudicated by the Court, their diversity in terms of \r\nsubject matter and the fact that they emanate from \r\nevery region of the world attest to the Court’s increasing \r\nrelevance, both as an organ and an instrument for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nWe note that in recent years the Court has moved \r\nto publish its decisions using modern information and \r\ncommunications technology. We also welcome its \r\nnew engagement with the public. Such efforts help to \r\npromote greater transparency in the Court’s activities. \r\nWe look forward to participating in the events the \r\nCourt is planning to mark its seventieth anniversary, \r\nin April next year. However, we noticed in the report \r\nthat no request was made for advisory opinions during \r\nthe period under review. We therefore urge that more \r\nuse be made of the Court for advisory opinions on \r\nsundry issues. Indeed, the importance of advisory \r\nopinions on legal questions referred to the Court in the \r\npursuit of peaceful settlement of disputes cannot be \r\noveremphasized.\r\nAccording to paragraphs 2 and 5 of Article 36 of \r\nthe Statute of the Court, States are expected to make \r\ndeclarations recognizing the Court’s compulsory \r\njurisdiction. However, Nigeria notes that of the \r\n193 States Members of the United Nations, only \r\n72 — less than half the membership — have so far \r\nmade declarations recognizing that jurisdiction. \r\nNigeria would like to see more countries accept it, in \r\nconsonance with resolution 69/123. In that regard, we \r\nencourage Member States that have yet to subscribe to \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court to endeavour \r\nto do so. That, we believe, would further strengthen the \r\nCourt’s role and ability to promote international justice \r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nFinally, Nigeria will continue to abide by its \r\ncommitment to promoting international justice and \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes, as a State party \r\nto the Statute of the International Court of Justice and \r\nhaving made a declaration recognizing the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court. We encourage all Member \r\nStates to continue to support the activities of the Court \r\nin order to promote international justice and the rule \r\nof law.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): We greatly appreciate the work of \r\nthe International Court of Justice as the principal \r\ninternational judicial body of the United Nations \r\nsystem. We congratulate Judge Ronny Abraham on his \r\nelection as President of the Court and thank him for his \r\ndetailed report (A/70/4).\r\nIt is clear that States continue to actively present \r\ntheir disputes for adjudication by the International \r\nCourt of Justice, demonstrating their high level of \r\ntrust in it. In many cases the Court’s judicial standards \r\nand expert opinions have become reference points \r\nfor States’ political and legal decisions. Thanks to its \r\ndedicated efforts, the International Court of Justice has \r\nmaintained a high level of momentum in its work for \r\nmany years, and has achieved that while dealing with \r\nthe greatly expanded scope of its cases, cited in the \r\nreport for their increased complexity and numbers.\r\nThe Court continues to consider disputes \r\nconcerning the delimitation of land and maritime areas, \r\na theme that has always been present in current affairs. \r\nHowever, today the dossier of the Court also includes \r\ncases related to economic rights, environmental \r\ndamage, disarmament, international humanitarian \r\nlaw and other issues. We note the fact that during the \r\nreporting period the Court has rendered judgments on a \r\nlarge number of decisions on various issues, including \r\na decision on the case concerning the Application of \r\nthe Convention on the Prevention and Punishment of \r\nthe Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. Serbia), which the \r\nCourt has been considering since 1999. We welcome \r\nthe efforts the International Court of Justice has been \r\nmaking to improve the effectiveness of its work, \r\nunder increasingly pressured conditions, as well as to \r\nmaintain the pace of its proceedings.\r\nAs the report rightly notes, the Court plays a key \r\nrole in the maintenance and promotion of the rule of \r\nlaw all over the world. The widespread dissemination \r\nof knowledge about the work of the Court plays an \r\nimportant part in this, achieved by ensuring the \r\nbroadest possible distribution of the Court’s decisions, \r\nthe development of multimedia platforms and the \r\nCourt’s work with educational institutions.\r\nIn 2016, the International Court of Justice will be \r\n70 years old. We believe that the events dedicated to the \r\nanniversary will be an excellent opportunity to once \r\nagain draw attention to the meaning and role of this key \r\ninstitution in the system for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
