Ae are \r\ngrateful for his presentation of the report on the work of \r\nthe Court (A/70/4) for the period 2015-2015 and for his \r\npresence here in the Assembly.\r\nDuring this reporting period, the work of the \r\nCourt was once again very intensive. It delivered one \r\njudgment, handed down nine orders, held two public \r\nhearings, was seized of a new contentious case and \r\nfollowing up on 12 pending proceedings. The fact that \r\nthese cases originate from every continent is a clear \r\nreflection of the universal character of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction.\r\nAs the peaceful settlement of international disputes \r\nis a vital objective of the United Nations, the role of \r\nthe Court in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and the promotion of the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level is a key one, hence the responsibility \r\nof the United Nations and its Member States to support \r\nthe ICJ in the fulfilment of its tasks. This support \r\ncalls for the Organization to ensure that the Court is \r\nable to deal effectively and objectively, with complete \r\nprocedural and judicial independence, with the cases \r\nsubmitted to it and that it has the resources necessary \r\nto discharge its mandate, bearing its workload in mind.\r\nA key requirement for the strengthening of the \r\nrule of law and of the Court itself is for States to act \r\nthroughout the process in accordance with the principle \r\nof good faith and to respect and comply with the \r\nCourt’s decisions, both judgments and orders, as well \r\nas all precautionary measures imposed, without any \r\nexception. Such compliance must be complete and \r\nin good faith so as to guarantee the integrity of each \r\nprocess and thereby strengthen the indisputable role of \r\nthe Court in ensuring peace and justice.\r\nIn that vein, we welcome the statements made by \r\nseveral States that spoke before me that reaffirmed their \r\ncommitment to fulfilling the obligations emanating \r\nfrom the Court’s decisions. I cannot but reiterate \r\nhow important it is for the Organization to seriously \r\nconsider options to follow up on these decisions and \r\nhighlight cases of non-compliance in order to avoid \r\nsuch situations, which contravene the rule of law.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the fact that in 2015, \r\ntwo States, Greece and Romania, made respective \r\ndeclarations recognizing as compulsory the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court, as contemplated by article 36, paragraphs \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.48\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n48th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 5 November 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\n2 and 5, of its Statute. However, although 193 countries \r\nare parties to that Statute, to date only 72 have accepted \r\nits jurisdiction. Costa Rica has accepted as compulsory \r\nits jurisdiction since 1973 and therefore takes note of \r\nthis fact this with concern. It respectfully calls on those \r\nStates that have not yet done so to consider making \r\nuse of the mechanism provided for in article 36 of the \r\nStatute of the Court.\r\nThroughout the years, the Court has made significant \r\ncontributions to the development of international law \r\nthrough its judgments and advisory opinions since it \r\nresolved the first dispute, on the Corfu Channel. Today, \r\non the eve of celebrating its seventieth anniversary, \r\nwe are certain that the Court will continue to work \r\ndiligently in order to resolve the disputes submitted to \r\nit in a fair and impartial fashion, in accordance with the \r\nlofty legal mission entrusted to it by States through the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nCosta Rica, which disbanded its armed forces in \r\n1948, depends solely on international justice to defend \r\nits sovereign rights. On that account and in accordance \r\nwith our traditional respect for the instruments and \r\nbodies of international law, we reiterate, once again, \r\nour commitment to faithfully abide by all the decisions \r\nthat issue from those bodies, reaffirming our full \r\nconfidence that the Court will continue to strengthen \r\npeace and justice through the objective exercise of its \r\nduties.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): Croatia thanks the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\nRonny Abraham, for his report (A/70/4) on the work of \r\nthe Court over the past year.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Court rendered \r\nits judgment in the case brought before it by Croatia, \r\nApplication of the Convention on the Prevention and \r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide (Croatia v. \r\nSerbia), and deliberated on a number of other cases \r\nbrought before it by other States, as elaborated in detail \r\nby Judge Abraham. In that regard, Croatia continues to \r\nclosely follow the work of the Court and all its activities.\r\nAdherence to the rule-of international law is pivotal \r\nto ensuring the peaceful settlement of disputes between \r\nStates and the avoidance of conflict. The International \r\nCourt of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, has a central and fundamental role to \r\nplay in strengthening the rule of law on the international \r\nlevel. Its task in that regard is indispensable.\r\nSeen more broadly, international adjudication, \r\nin addition to its original and primary purpose to \r\ndecide disputes between States, contributes, by its \r\nvery existence, to the idea that there is an alternative \r\nto the unlimited exercise and misuse of power. That is \r\nwhy international adjudication needs to be developed \r\nin accordance with the highest standards, legal and \r\nmoral alike. Jurisprudence, within the framework of \r\napplicable international law and its predictability, \r\nmust be a powerful instrument in settling disputes by \r\npeaceful means and in accordance with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nLet me emphasize that States need to have \r\nconfidence that their disputes will be decided upon \r\ncompetently, independently and impartially, within \r\nthe framework of the highest legal and ethical and \r\nprofessional standards. The confidence of States that \r\nongoing disputes will be settled through international \r\nadjudication according to the highest standards is of \r\nparamount importance for the willingness of States \r\nto turn to judicial settlement for the resolution of their \r\ndisputes and for their choice of the legal framework \r\nover any other means. Indeed, the entire architecture \r\nof international adjudication rests upon that pivotal \r\npremise.\r\nIn conclusion, let me extend Croatia’s support to \r\nthe Court and its important work.\r\nMs. Mesquita Borges (Timor-Leste): Allow, me at \r\nthe outset, to thank the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, Judge Ronny Abraham, for presenting \r\nthe report (A/70/4) on the work of the Court and or his \r\nwork at the Court over the past year.\r\nTimor-Leste associates itself with the statement \r\n(see A/70/PV.47) delivered by the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nThe International Court of Justice, as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, is tasked with \r\npromoting the peaceful settlement of disputes, in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nFurthermore, it is the only international court of a \r\nuniversal character with general jurisdiction.\r\nThe universal nature of the Court is reflected in \r\nthe diversity of the cases coming before it. As stated \r\nin the Court’s report, the current docket includes \r\ncases brought by sovereign parties from all regional \r\ngroups. That highlights the importance attached \r\n15-35224 3/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nglobally to the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes, as enshrined in the Charter, and to ensuring \r\nthat international peace and security and justice are \r\nnot endangered. There has also been an increase in \r\nthe confidence and trust placed upon the Court, in \r\nparticular by developing countries and small States. \r\nThe reliance of small States on the Court to protect \r\ntheir sovereignty is a testament to its ability to resolve \r\ninternational disputes in conformity with the principles \r\nof justice and international law. It is our experience \r\nthat international law serves well in protecting the \r\nrights and interests of small States. That is why Timor-\r\nLeste is such a strong supporter of the United Nations \r\nand international law. The multilateral system and \r\ninternational law guide fair behaviour and can provide \r\nStates with options for dispute resolution. To date, \r\n72 Member States have made declarations recognizing \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. Timor-Leste \r\nis in that group and expresses its strong support for \r\nand faith in the Court. That is exemplified by the case \r\nbrought before the International Court of Justice by \r\nTimor-Leste, Questions relating to the Seizure and \r\nDetention of Certain Documents and Data (Timor-\r\nLeste v. Australia).\r\nThe United Nations High-level Meeting on the \r\nRule of Law at the National and International Levels \r\n(see A/67/PV.5) recognized the positive contribution \r\nof the International Court of Justice and the value of \r\nits work for the promotion of the rule of law, which \r\nit carries out through its judgments and advisory \r\nopinions, in accordance with the Charter and, in \r\nparticular, in accordance with Articles 33 and 96. In \r\nits role in promoting and clarifying international law, \r\nthe Court has contributed to the development of law in \r\nthe following areas: interference in the domestic affairs \r\nof States, the violation of territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty, and economic rights, among others. Timor-\r\nLeste acknowledges the role of the Court in capacity-\r\nbuilding through the provision of information to both \r\nStates and organizations regarding the procedures of \r\nthe Court.\r\nIn conclusion, the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations provides an opportunity to renew our \r\ncommitment — the commitment of the international \r\ncommunity — to the pacific settlement of disputes \r\nand to the work of the International Court of Justice. \r\nOnly through such a commitment can we ensure the \r\npromotion of the rule of law in international relations \r\nby the United Nations.\r\nMr. Cheong Loon Lai (Malaysia): Malaysia \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement (see A/70/PV.47).\r\nWe wish to express our appreciation to Judge \r\nRonny Abraham, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, for the report (A/70/4) and for his briefing to \r\nthe General Assembly on the work of the Court. We also \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his report (A/70/327).\r\nJudge Abraham’s briefing has provided the General \r\nAssembly with a better understanding of, and insight \r\ninto, the work of the Court. We furthermore wish to \r\ntake this opportunity to commend the judges of the \r\nCourt for their unwavering sense of duty in upholding \r\nthe rule of law. We view international law as the legal \r\nbedrock governing and regulating inter-State relations. \r\nIt is in that regard that, in our view, the International \r\nCourt of Justice, as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, played an important and major role in \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security by \r\nproviding a forum for the adjudication and peaceful \r\nresolutions of disputes between States and by handing \r\ndown advisory opinions of the Court on questions and \r\ninterpretations of law. The rulings and decisions of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice epitomize the application \r\nof the rule of law at the international level. Furthermore, \r\nthe rulings and decisions of the Court undoubtedly \r\nenrich the corpus of knowledge regarding international \r\nlaw. The increasing number of cases referred to the \r\nCourt serves to provide further testament of the faith \r\nand confidence that the international community has \r\nin the Court’s ability to discharge its adjudicative \r\nfunctions fairly and impartially, in accordance with the \r\nrecognized principles of international law, including \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the Statute of the \r\nCourt.\r\nThe International Court of Justice plays an \r\nimportant role in the peaceful resolution of disputes \r\nthrough its adjudication process. We view the apolitical \r\nnature of the Court in the discharge of its functions as \r\nan important element contributing to the just and fair \r\nadjudication of the cases before it. It is our view that \r\nthe General Assembly and the International Court of \r\nJustice, as principal organs of the United Nations, are \r\nworking towards achieving the same goal, namely, the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe firmly and steadfastly believe that States should \r\nresolve their differences through peaceful means, \r\n4/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nas provided for in international law, and not by the \r\nthreat or use of force. If dialogue fails and a negotiated \r\nsettlement cannot be achieved, we view the Court, in \r\naddition to the other dispute settlement mechanisms \r\navailable to the parties, as an avenue for the parties \r\nto a dispute to peacefully resolve their differences. \r\nBecause of our commitment to the peaceful resolution \r\nof disputes and our confidence in the Court’s fullest \r\napplication of the rule of law, Malaysia and its immediate \r\nneighbours agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt two cases regarding disputes on sovereignty \r\nconcerning several maritime issues. Our confidence \r\nin the impartiality of the adjudication process is \r\nreflected in our full acceptance of, adherence to and \r\nrespect for the decisions of the Court. In addition, on \r\ntwo separate occasions, Malaysia also availed itself, in \r\nthe General Assembly, of the advisory opinion entitled \r\nLegal consequences of the construction of a wall in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian Territory (A/ES-10/273) and \r\nanother advisory opinion entitled Legality of the threat \r\nor use of nuclear weapons (A/51/218, annex).\r\nWe furthermore regard the Court’s outreach \r\nprogrammes, including its encouragement of visits by \r\nMember States, its publications and its other online \r\nresources, as important tools for raising the awareness \r\nof the international community with regard to the work \r\nand function of the International Court of Justice. We \r\nview the briefings by the President of the Court to the \r\nGeneral Assembly as important elements in support \r\nof our mutual commitment to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. We therefore reiterate \r\nour fullest support for the work of the Court.\r\nMr. Atlassi (Morocco) (spoke in French): Allow me, \r\nat the outset to thank Judge Ronny Abraham, President \r\nof the International Court of Justice, for his exhaustive \r\nreport (A/70/4) covering the Court’s activities from \r\n1 August 2014 through 31 July 2015. I would also like \r\nto take this opportunity to congratulate the re-elected \r\njudges, namely Judges Mohamed Bennouna, Joan \r\nDonoghue and Kirill Gevorgian, along with those \r\nnewly elected in the context of renewing the Court’s \r\ncomposition on 6 November 2014 (see A/69/PV.39).\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, and by the representative of South Africa, on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States (see A/70/PV.47). \r\nI would like, however, to make several remarks in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nThe International Court of Justice, established by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations in June 1945, is the \r\nmain judicial organ of the United Nations. The basic \r\ntexts of the Court are therefore the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and its own Statute, which is also part \r\nof the Charter. As of 31 July 2015, 193 States were party \r\nto that Statute. Those States, in full exercise of their \r\nsovereignty, may seize the Court with an application \r\nseeking resolution of any manner of dispute, whether \r\nbilateral or multilateral, thanks to its character as the \r\nsole international arbiter with universal jurisdiction \r\nin both contentious cases and advisory proceedings, \r\nwhich makes it more accessible and more sought after \r\nfor its opinions on the differences and disputes among \r\nStates.\r\nThe disputes that the Court has considered concern, \r\namong other matters, territorial and maritime issues, \r\nviolations of territorial integrity and sovereignty, \r\ngenocide, environmental damage, the preservation of \r\nbiological resources, the interpretation and application \r\nof international conventions and treaties, and the \r\ndemand for a ban on nuclear weapons. That variety of \r\nissues serves to demonstrate the general character of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations and affirms its universality. Moreover, \r\nmore than 300 bilateral and multilateral treaties or \r\nconventions provide for the Court’s jurisdiction ratione \r\nmateriae in resolving differences that concern the \r\nimplementation or interpretation of those agreements. \r\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly, as \r\nwell as other United Nations organs, are authorized to \r\nask the Court for advisory opinions on all legal issues \r\npursuant to Article 96, paragraph 1, of the Charter. As \r\na result, the International Court of Justice is the judicial \r\norgan par excellence of the United Nations system.\r\nThe Court has an important role to play in the \r\npromotion and peaceful settlement of disputes, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of the Charter, in \r\nparticular Chapter VI and Articles 33 and 94. It can \r\nalso play a role in encouraging parties to come to the \r\nnegotiating table and by delivering transactional justice, \r\nwhich offers parties an opportunity to resolve their \r\ndifferences on their own. In doing so, the Court renders \r\nan invaluable service to parties in dispute parties and \r\nplays an invaluable role as a facilitator of negotiations.\r\nThe impact of the International Court of Justice \r\ngoes well beyond the judgments and opinions that it \r\ndelivers. Indeed, many disputes have found their way to \r\nresolution simply because one of the parties suggested \r\n15-35224 5/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nhaving recourse to the Court. That is all the more true \r\ninasmuch as the Court is an integral part of an overall \r\nprocess that seeks the peaceful resolution of disputes, \r\non the one hand, and the promotion of the rule of law, on \r\nthe other. Through its decisions and advisory opinions \r\nthe Court contributes to strengthening and clarifying \r\ninternational law and to the primacy of the law itself \r\nin promoting peace. The Court’s jurisprudence has \r\nbroadly contributed to the gradual development of \r\nthe rules of international law. That is particularly true \r\ninasmuch as the Court plays a key role through its \r\nmutually beneficial complementarity with the Security \r\nCouncil in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. Moreover, its practice shows that some disputes \r\nsubmitted to the Court have achieved resolution not \r\nthrough a decision by the Court, but simply because \r\npreliminary measures contributed to their resolution. \r\nIn addition, the dissemination and publication of the \r\nCourt’s judgments, advisory opinions and decisions \r\ncontributes to promoting the values and principles of \r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts and of preventive \r\ndiplomacy.\r\nIn conclusion, the Kingdom of Morocco appreciates \r\nthe important role played by the Court in the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes and its valuable contribution to \r\nreinforcing and implementing the rules of international \r\nlaw.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note \r\nof the report of the International Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 75?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 78\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/70/350)\r\nReports by the Secretary-General (A/70/317 \r\nand A/70/346)\r\nThe President: I welcome to the General Assembly \r\nJudge Silvia Alejandra Fernández de Gurmendi, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court.\r\nThe International Criminal Court was established \r\nas an independent permanent international court in \r\nrelationship with the United Nations system, with \r\njurisdiction over the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community as a whole, with a \r\nview to ending impunity for the perpetrators of those \r\ncrimes. The Court is the leading international reference \r\nfor justice with regard to genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes, and is a fundamental actor \r\nin efforts to deter future atrocities. The International \r\nCriminal Court represents a voluntary gathering of \r\nnations in a mosaic of values and aspirations for a more \r\nsecure world on the path towards ending impunity.\r\nIt is now my honour to invite Judge Fernández de \r\nGurmendi to take the f loor.\r\nMs. Fernández de Gurmendi (International \r\nCriminal Court) (spoke in Spanish): It is a great honour \r\nto present to the General Assembly the eleventh annual \r\nreport (see A/70/350) of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC).\r\nThis is the first time that I appear before the \r\nAssembly in my capacity of President of the Court, \r\nbut it is not my first time in the Hall. As a former \r\nrepresentative of my country to the United Nations, I am \r\nvery familiar with, and immensely appreciative of, the \r\nimportant work that goes on in the General Assembly \r\nand its Main Committees. I also had the privilege of \r\nparticipating directly in the negotiation of the Rome \r\nStatute under the auspices of the Organization. The \r\nsupport of the United Nations was, and continues to \r\nbe, extremely important for the International Criminal \r\nCourt.\r\nThe Rome Statute reaffirms the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court \r\nwas based primarily on the recognition that atrocious \r\ncrimes that offend the international community as \r\na whole threatened international peace and security \r\nand undermined the essential values that the United \r\nNations endeavours to promote. Through the Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court, States reaffirmed \r\nthe primary responsibility of national jurisdictions for \r\ninvestigating and prosecuting such crimes. However, in \r\nestablishing the Court, States also recognized that there \r\nare times when domestic courts alone, for a variety \r\nreasons, cannot cope. The International Criminal \r\nCourt is complementary to national systems in such \r\nsituations, with the goal of avoiding impunity for the \r\n6/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nmost serious crimes, as well as contributing to their \r\nprevention. The creation of a permanent International \r\nCriminal Court to judge such crimes brought to fruition \r\na long-standing aspiration, and its establishment was \r\nnot an easy process. It required enormous diplomatic \r\nand technical efforts to achieve broad agreement on \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction, its substantive and procedural \r\nlegal framework and its cooperation and enforcement \r\nregime. Today, there is a widespread expectation that \r\natrocious crimes must not go unpunished, and the \r\nCourt has a central role in upholding that expectation \r\nof the international community and the hope of victims \r\nall over the world.\r\nAgainst that background, I can assure the Assembly \r\nthat, as President of the International Criminal Court, \r\nI recognize the enormous responsibility that rests on \r\nthe Court. The Court must fulfil its mandate, but it \r\nis clear that it cannot meet those expectations alone. \r\nThe Court relies heavily on the cooperation of States \r\nand organizations at every step of the process, from \r\ninvestigation to arrests and from witness protection to \r\nthe enforcement of sentences. However, just as the Court \r\nexpects cooperation from the international community, \r\nwe recognize that the Court is expected to do its part \r\nefficiently, by providing high quality justice in a \r\ntimely manner. For that reason, I have made it the main \r\npriority of my mandate to enhance the effectiveness \r\nand efficiency of the International Criminal Court. All \r\norgans of the Court are actively engaged in important \r\nreforms with that goal in mind. Over recent months \r\nthe judges in particular have made unprecedented \r\ncollective efforts to expedite the criminal process by \r\nadopting best practices and revising working methods. \r\nIt is important to note that those efforts have already \r\nyielded very positive results. As President, I intend to \r\ndeploy all available efforts to complete all necessary \r\nreforms.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me now provide a concise update on the Court’s \r\njudicial developments. More details can be found in the \r\nwritten report that members have before them.\r\nWe reached several milestones during the past year. \r\nThe Court issued its first two final appeals judgments \r\non the merits, as well as the first appeals judgments \r\non sentencing and reparations. Two new trials have \r\nrecently commenced hearings of evidence before the \r\nCourt, and a third trial is due to commence early in \r\n2016. Together with one existing trial, that means that \r\nnext year we expect to have up to four trials running \r\nat once, involving a total of 10 accused persons — the \r\nCourt’s busiest year so far in terms of trial proceedings.\r\nIn addition to those cases, two further suspects \r\nwere transferred to the ICC this year. Mr. Dominic \r\nOngwen, an alleged brigade commander in the \r\nLord’s Resistance Army in Uganda, was transferred \r\nto the Court almost 10 years after the arrest warrant \r\nagainst him was originally issued. And more recently, \r\nMr. Ahmad Al-Faqi Al-Mahdi was surrendered to \r\nthe Court on charges of war crimes regarding the \r\ndestruction of historical and religious monuments \r\nin Timbuktu. Pre-trial proceedings in both cases are \r\ncurrently under way. In that connection, it is helpful \r\nthat we will be moving into the ICC’s new permanent \r\npremises next month, which will provide more capacity \r\nfor handling the Court’s growing caseload, as well as \r\nbetter facilities for public access.\r\nIn September 2014, the Prosecutor opened her \r\nninth investigation, following a second referral from \r\nthe Central African Republic, this time with respect \r\nto crimes allegedly committed on its territory since \r\n2012. The Prosecutor also recently requested judicial \r\nauthorization to open an investigation into the \r\nsituation in Georgia, covering the period from 1 July \r\nto 10 October 2008, for war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity allegedly committed in and around South \r\nOssetia. That matter is currently before the Pre-Trial \r\nChamber, which will consider whether or not there are \r\nreasonable grounds to proceed with an investigation in \r\naccordance with the Statute.\r\nDuring the past year, the ICC reached some \r\nimportant milestones in the implementation of its \r\nunique reparations mandate, which gives unprecedented \r\nattention to the rights of the victims of international \r\ncrimes. The first appeals judgment on reparations, \r\nin the case of Mr. Thomas Lubanga, provided more \r\nclarity on the principles to be applied to reparations \r\ncases under the Rome Statute and, in the circumstances \r\nof this particular case, instructed the Trust Fund for \r\nVictims associated with the Court to produce a draft \r\nimplementation plan for collective reparations in \r\naccordance with the Trust Fund’s mandate. The Trust \r\nFund filed its draft implementation plan earlier this \r\nweek, and the matter is now in the hands of the Trial \r\nChamber. Reparations proceedings are also under way \r\nin the case of Mr. Germain Katanga, whose conviction \r\nfor crimes against humanity and war crimes committed \r\n15-35224 7/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nin the Ituri district of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo became final last year.\r\nRegarding other activities during the reporting \r\nperiod, the Trust Fund for Victims has been actively \r\ncarrying out its assistance mandate. Psychological, \r\nphysical and material support remains central in \r\nresponding to the needs of victims under the jurisdiction \r\nof the ICC. The Trust Fund, in conjunction with locally \r\nbased partners in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and Uganda, has assisted a total of over 50,000 \r\nbeneficiaries of psychological rehabilitation, over 1,300 \r\nbeneficiaries of physical rehabilitation and over 2,500 \r\nbeneficiaries of material support. The Trust Fund’s \r\nassistance programme integrates several cross-cutting \r\nthemes, such as supporting the advancement of women’s \r\nrights, restoring the dignity of victims, promoting \r\npeacebuilding, supporting the rights of children \r\naffected by armed conflict, mobilizing communities, \r\nmanaging crises and addressing the impact of sexual \r\nand gender-based violence. The ability of the Trust \r\nFund for Victims to provide general assistance and \r\nto supplement reparations, where necessary, depends \r\nentirely upon donations and the generous voluntary \r\ncontributions of States. I would like to warmly thank \r\nthose States that have supported the ICC’s Trust Fund \r\nfor Victims to date, and encourage others to consider \r\ndoing so, in the interests of the victims and their \r\naffected communities.\r\nIn recognition of the important relationship \r\nbetween the ICC and the United Nations, the Court’s \r\nreport addresses at greater length than before the \r\nvarious aspects of the cooperation between our \r\norganizations. It ranges from logistical assistance in \r\nthe field to administrative and personnel arrangements, \r\njudicial assistance and the provision of services such as \r\nthose relating to security, satellite communications and \r\nthe use of conference facilities. In accordance with the \r\nrelationship agreement between the United Nations and \r\nthe International Criminal Court, the Court reimburses \r\nthe Organization for the assistance that it receives. \r\nCooperation also works in the other direction, and the \r\nCourt has on occasion provided logistical and security \r\nsupport to the United Nations.\r\nIn summary, the relationship between the United \r\nNations and the Court is doing well, and the Court \r\nis very grateful for the support it receives. I would \r\nlike to emphasize that the cooperation of the United \r\nNations, as well as the cooperation of its funds, \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies, is important \r\nto the Court’s activities. Nonetheless, there are some \r\nongoing challenges. One is the continuing lack of full \r\ncooperation in relation to the two situations that the \r\nSecurity Council referred to the Prosecutor, namely, \r\nDarfur and Libya. During the reporting period, the Court \r\nmade three judicial findings of non-cooperation — two \r\nwith respect to the Sudan and one with respect to Libya. \r\nThat brings to 11 the total number of non-cooperation \r\nfindings referred to the Council. For the Court to be able \r\nto effectively discharge its mandate, full compliance \r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions is \r\nrequired. The Court alone is not in a position to secure \r\nthat compliance, so we look to the Council for active \r\nsupport in that regard.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn addition to the important relationship with the \r\nUnited Nations, the Court has continued to develop its \r\ninteraction and cooperation with other international \r\nand regional organizations, institutions and entities, as \r\nwell as with States in all parts of the world. The Court \r\nhas cooperation agreements with the European Union, \r\nthe Organization of American States, the African-Asian \r\nLegal Consultative Organization, the Commonwealth, \r\nthe International Organization of La Francophonie, \r\nand the Parliament of Southern Common Market, \r\namong others. We continue to engage with various \r\nregional organizations in order to foster support for \r\nour activities. Just two weeks ago, the Court and the \r\nAfrican Union held a joint technical seminar at African \r\nUnion headquarters in Addis Ababa — the fourth in \r\na series of seminars that started in 2011. We are also \r\ndeeply grateful for the excellent cooperation that we \r\nhave received from States in all regions of the world. \r\nTo further enhance that vital relationship, we have held \r\ncooperation seminars in various regions, with the kind \r\nassistance of donors, and look forward to continuing \r\nthat practice.\r\nIt has been an eventful year in terms of institutional \r\ndevelopments at the ICC. Six new judges were elected \r\nto the Court in December 2014, and sworn in on \r\n10 March 2015. Their contributions have already \r\nbeen outstanding, and I am sure that they will serve \r\nthe Court well during their nine-year mandate. The \r\nAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute elected \r\nMr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister of Justice of Senegal, as the \r\nnew President of the Assembly for a three-year term. \r\nMinister Kaba enjoys the full support of the Court in \r\nthe important role that he has assumed at the helm of \r\nthe Court’s parent body.\r\n8/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nSince the Court’s previous report to the United \r\nNations (see A/69/321), the number of States parties \r\nto the Rome Statute has increased to 123, with the \r\naccession of the State of Palestine on 2 January 2015. \r\nThere have also been several new ratifications of the \r\namendments to the Rome Statute adopted at the Review \r\nConference in Kampala in 2010. To date, a total of \r\n26 States have ratified the amendments to article 8, \r\nconcerning the use of poison weapons and expanding \r\nbullets in non-international armed conflicts, and 24 \r\nStates have ratified the amendments on the crime of \r\naggression. In addition, two States — Senegal and \r\nthe State of Palestine — have ratified the Agreement \r\non the Privileges and Immunities of the International \r\nCriminal Court, bringing the total number of parties \r\nto the Agreement to 74. I encourage all the remaining \r\nStates parties and other interested States to consider \r\nratifying the Agreement.\r\nAs a judicial institution, the International Criminal \r\nCourt is a distinct kind of international organization. \r\nThe Rome Statute explicitly requires the judges to \r\nbe independent in the performance of their functions \r\nand requires the Prosecutor and her staff not to seek \r\nor act on instructions from any external source. The \r\nindependence of judicial and prosecutorial functions \r\nfrom external influence is essential for ensuring the \r\nCourt’s identity and the achievement of its goals. \r\nWithout independence, the Court’s whole raison d’être \r\nis compromised. That independence does not, however, \r\nmean unfettered freedom. At all times, the Court’s \r\nactivities are defined by the legal framework within \r\nwhich it operates.\r\nThe Rome Statute is the Court’s constitution. It sets \r\nthe limits of what we can and cannot do. The Court is \r\naccountable to States parties, the Assembly of States \r\nParties and the international community at large. But \r\nwhen it comes to the Court’s judicial and prosecutorial \r\nfunctions, its independence must be maintained. \r\nThe Court must act within its legal framework and \r\ncannot step outside its legal boundaries in order to \r\naccommodate political objectives.\r\nJoining the Rome Statute is a sovereign decision \r\nfor each State to make. I know that 72 Member States \r\namong those seated in this Hall have so far not decided \r\nto take that step. I would like to recall that they can \r\nnonetheless contribute to the work of the Court and the \r\nbroader Rome Statute system. Indeed, non-party States \r\ncan provide us with valuable cooperation and regularly \r\nattend meetings of the Assembly of States parties in an \r\nobserver capacity. I know that many of the non-party \r\nStates are actively contemplating ratification or \r\naccession to the Rome Statute and are making concrete \r\nefforts towards that goal. I hope to welcome many of \r\nthem to the International Criminal Court family during \r\nmy term as President. Only with global participation \r\ncan the Court be fully effective in intervening whenever \r\ncore international crimes are committed with impunity. \r\nOur deterrent effect equally depends on the competence \r\nof our jurisdiction.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, before the end of the year, \r\nthe Court will move to its new permanent premises in \r\nThe Hague. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nextend an invitation to all members of the Assembly \r\nto visit us there. Our doors are open to everyone. Let \r\nus cooperate towards the attainment of our shared \r\nobjectives, namely, the rule of law, peace, security and \r\nprevention.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court for her briefing.\r\nI now give the f loor to the observer of the European \r\nUnion.\r\nMr. Marhic (European Union) (spoke in French): \r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion and its member States. The candidate countries \r\nof the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Serbia \r\nand Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation process Bosnia and Herzegovina; and the \r\npotential candidate countries the Republic of Moldova \r\nand Georgia, align themselves with this statement.\r\nAt the outset, we wish to congratulate President \r\nFernández de Gurmendi on her election and to thank her \r\nfor her presence in New York and her comprehensive \r\nbriefing. We also thank the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for its annual report (see A/70/350) to \r\nthe United Nations, which covers the period from \r\n1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015 and provides details on \r\nwhat is described as a new year marked by a heavy \r\nworkload for the ICC. We are staunch supporters of \r\nthe International Criminal Court, and our strong policy \r\nin that regard has a firm institutional foundation in a \r\ndetailed 12 July 2011 European Council decision on the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and a 2011 action plan \r\non implementation, which is adapted to the evolving \r\nactivities of the Court.\r\nWe acknowledge from this year’s report that, \r\nwith 21 cases in eight situations at different stages \r\n15-35224 9/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nof procedure, with 10 situations under preliminary \r\nexamination and one new investigation by the \r\nProsecutor, the ICC is facing an increased workload. \r\nWe also note the important legal developments during \r\nthe period — the transfer of Mr. Dominic Ongwen \r\nand his initial Court appearance in January 2015; the \r\ndecisions on the Court’s first two appeals for judgment \r\non the merits relating to the situation in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Congo, in December 2014 and February \r\n2015, respectively; and the confirmation of charges \r\nagainst Mr. Charles Blé Goudé in December 2014. With \r\nregard to the situation in Mali, we welcome the fact that \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor has paid special attention \r\nto allegations related to the attacks directed against \r\nhistoric monuments, notably those inscribed on the list \r\nof World Heritage sites. We note, in that regard, that \r\non 30 September 2015, Mr. Ahmad Al Faqi Al Mandi \r\nappeared before the ICC on charges related to attacks \r\nagainst such buildings.\r\nThe latest report of the ICC describes the efforts that \r\nthe Court has made to fulfil its mandate, the positive \r\ndevelopments and the challenges it faces. Looking to \r\nnext year, we note that an unprecedented number of \r\nfour trials will be held simultaneously, covering trials \r\nthat focus on allegations of crimes involving more than \r\n10,000 victims. The Court thus continues to give hope to \r\nthe victims of the most grievous crimes. We emphasize \r\nthat the participation of victims and the reparations for \r\nvictims are key components of the ICC’s legal system.\r\nIn the context of the increasing workload of the ICC, \r\nwe stress the importance of a truly efficient and effective \r\nfunctioning of the Court. While the proceedings before \r\nthe Court must be fair and must be implemented in full \r\ncompliance with the highest standards of justice, the \r\nCourt’s activities must be based on financial analyses \r\nand meticulous budgeting processes.\r\nThe universality of the Rome Statute continues to \r\npresent one of the main challenges facing the ICC, as \r\nuniversality is essential so as to ensure accountability \r\nfor the most serious crimes of concern to the entire \r\ninternational community. The perpetrators of such \r\ncrimes, regardless of their status, must be held \r\naccountable for their actions. A key element in the \r\nRome Statute is that it applies equally to all persons, \r\nwithout any distinction based on official capacity. We \r\nmust continue to work tirelessly to make the Rome \r\nStatute truly universal.\r\nOn 1 April 2015 we saw the Palestinian accession \r\nto the Rome Statute of the ICC, and we took note of the \r\ndecision of the ICC Prosecutor to open a preliminary \r\nexamination of the situation in Palestine. There \r\nwere two additional accessions to the Agreement on \r\nthe Privileges and Immunities of the International \r\nCriminal Court, six States ratified the amendment to \r\narticle 8 of the Rome Statute and eight States ratified or \r\naccepted the amendments to the Statute on the crime of \r\naggression, including the following European member \r\nStates: the Czech Republic, Latvia, Malta, Poland and \r\nSpain. We also note the declaration lodged by Ukraine \r\nunder article 12, paragraph 3, of the Rome Statute, on \r\n8 September, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court for \r\nan indefinite duration, which represents an important \r\nstep towards universality.\r\nDuring the reporting period, we continued to \r\nengage in promoting the universality of the Rome \r\nStatute and in increasing participation in the Agreement \r\non the Privileges and Immunities of the Court, as well \r\nas promoting a better understanding of the Court’s \r\nmandate through démarches and dialogues with third \r\nStates and international organizations, the organization \r\nof dedicated local or regional seminars, the systematic \r\ninclusion of an ICC clause into agreements with \r\nthird countries and financial support to civil-society \r\norganizations.\r\nThe primary responsibility for bringing offenders \r\nto justice lies with States themselves, in conformity \r\nwith the relevant provisions of the Rome Statute. \r\nComplementarity is a core principle in the Rome \r\nStatute. In order to make it operational, all States parties \r\nneed to prepare and adopt effective national legislation \r\nto implement the Rome Statute in national systems. \r\nThrough various assistance instruments and projects, \r\nwe support initiatives that focus on encouraging States \r\nto cooperate in the fight against impunity for atrocity \r\ncrimes. We welcome the positive dynamic in terms of \r\ncomplementarity regarding the situation in Guinea, as \r\ndescribed in the report. We commend in particular the \r\nfact that the quality and pace of national proceedings \r\nincreased significantly during the reporting period, \r\nowing to the efforts of the Office of the Prosecutor, the \r\nUnited Nations system, civil society and the Guinean \r\nauthorities.\r\nAnother continuing fundamental challenge lies \r\nin the necessity of ensuring cooperation with the \r\nICC, and in particular how to react to instances of \r\nnon-cooperation by States that are thereby in violation \r\n10/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nof their obligations with regard to the ICC. Cooperation \r\nwith the Court and the enforcement of its decisions are \r\nequally essential if the Court is to be able to carry out \r\nits mandate. That applies to all States parties to the \r\nRome Statute, as well as when the Security Council \r\nhas referred a situation to the Court in accordance with \r\nChapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nWe note with concern that a certain number of arrest \r\nwarrants issued by the Court remain outstanding — some \r\nsince 2005. We recall that non-cooperation with the \r\nCourt with regard to the execution of arrest warrants \r\nconstitutes a violation of international obligations and \r\nstif les the Court’s ability to deliver justice. We call \r\nupon all States to take consistent actions to encourage \r\nappropriate and full cooperation with the Court, \r\nincluding the prompt execution of arrest warrants. \r\nWe also reiterate the critical importance for all States \r\nof refraining from helping to shelter or hide the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes and of taking \r\nthe necessary steps to bring those perpetrators to justice \r\nin order to end impunity.\r\nWe welcome the actions undertaken by States, \r\ninternational organizations and civil society to increase \r\ntheir cooperation with, and assistance to, the ICC. We \r\nwelcome in particular the cooperation of the United \r\nNations with the Court, at Headquarters, at the level \r\nof United Nations specialized agencies and at the field-\r\nmissions level, which is described in the report. We note \r\nwith appreciation the fact that the Rule of Law Unit \r\nof the Secretariat, the Office of the Rule of Law and \r\nSecurity Institutions and the rule of law components of \r\npeacekeeping missions have proven useful in promoting \r\ninternational justice, in particular in countries in \r\nwhich the Court has been active. We acknowledge the \r\nrecommendations in the report for mainstreaming the \r\nCourt in the United Nations system, in particular the \r\nfact that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) could provide an important platform for \r\nstrengthening national jurisdictions. We also note that \r\nthe Court continues to welcome the updated guidelines \r\nof the Secretary-General on contacts with persons who \r\nare the subjects of arrest warrants or summonses issued \r\nby the Court.\r\nThe European Union and its member States, for \r\ntheir part, are committed to pursuing their efforts in the \r\narea of the fight against impunity, including by giving \r\nthe Court their full diplomatic support.\r\nOur common goal continues to be the same: to further \r\nstrengthen the Court so that it can fulfil its mandate \r\neffectively. There are States parties to the ICC in all \r\nparts of the world, and all States parties share a feeling \r\nof ownership of the Rome Statute. We will continue \r\nto encourage the broadest possible participation in the \r\nRome Statute, and we are determined to safeguard the \r\nintegrity of the Statute, support the independence of \r\nthe Court and ensure cooperation with the it. We are \r\nalso committed to fully implementing the principle of \r\ncomplementarity, enshrined in the Rome Statute, by \r\nfacilitating effective and efficient interaction between \r\nnational justice systems and the ICC in the fight against \r\nimpunity.\r\nMs. Aching (Trinidad and Tobago): I have the \r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\n14 member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM).\r\nCARICOM wishes to congratulate the President of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) on her election. \r\nWe also take this opportunity to reiterate our steadfast \r\ncommitment to cooperating with all the organs of the \r\nCourt as they seek to fulfil the mandate of the ICC \r\nand improve its effectiveness and efficiency. We also \r\nexpress our gratitude to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe reports and the note on the International Criminal \r\nCourt contained in documents A/70/346, A/70/317 and \r\nA/70/350, respectively.\r\nWe wish to express our unwavering commitment \r\nto the ICC based on its primary objectives, namely, \r\nto help put an end to impunity for perpetrators of the \r\nmost serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity, to contribute to the prevention of the \r\natrocious crimes listed under article 5 of the Rome \r\nStatute and to ensure that the perpetrators of the \r\nmost serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity are brought to justice, thereby preventing \r\nimpunity.\r\nCARICOM recognizes the importance of the ICC \r\nin promoting the rule of law, encouraging respect for \r\nhuman rights and achieving sustainable peace and the \r\nfurther development of nations, in accordance with \r\ninternational law and the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. CARICOM agrees \r\nthat the success of the Court is intrinsically linked \r\nto the universality of the Rome Statute. We believe \r\nthat, through increased cooperation, the Court would \r\nbe better able to effectively discharge the mandate \r\n15-35224 11/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nentrusted to it by States parties. To that end, we \r\nreiterate our commitment to promoting the universality \r\nof the Rome Statute. In addition, we urge all States that \r\nhave not yet done so to ratify and fully implement the \r\nRome Statute of the ICC with a view to promoting its \r\nuniversality.\r\nWe also welcome the number of ratifications of \r\nthe Rome Statute and the Kampala amendments. We \r\nremain optimistic that the required 30 ratifications will \r\nbe achieved before 2017 so as to facilitate the entry into \r\nforce of the Kampala amendments, which would enable \r\nthe Court to exercise its jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression. We also recognize the most recent States \r\nparties to accede to the Agreement on the Privileges \r\nand Immunities of the ICC.\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nCooperation with the Court remains at the centre \r\nof the Rome Statute and falls not only to States parties \r\nbut also to all States Members of the United Nations, \r\nespecially when referrals by the Security Council are \r\ninvolved. Those who argue in some quarters that the ICC \r\nis an obstacle to achieving lasting peace and security \r\nmust be reminded that, consistent with the doctrine of \r\ncomplementarity enshrined in the Rome Statute, the \r\njurisdiction of the ICC is invoked only when States are \r\nunable or unwilling to prosecute those individuals who \r\nare accused of perpetrating the most severe crimes of \r\nconcern to the international community. In other words, \r\nno individual or State should fear the ICC, because it is \r\na court of last resort.\r\nCARICOM remains concerned about the failure of \r\nsome States to honour their legally binding obligations \r\nto cooperate with the Court in the execution of \r\noutstanding arrest warrants aimed at bringing to justice \r\nthose who have committed the most severe crimes of \r\nconcern to the international community. We wish to \r\nunderline that those who fail to cooperate with the \r\nCourt are contributing to impunity, which not only \r\nundermines the rule of law but also constitutes an \r\naffront to the victims of grave crimes.\r\nCARICOM remains deeply concerned that, while \r\nthe workload of the Court increased significantly over \r\nthe past year, a similar increase in resources has not \r\nbeen observed. The report of the Secretary-General \r\nmakes it clear that 2016 will be the busiest year in the \r\nhistory of the Court, with an unprecedented number \r\nof four cases taking place simultaneously, covering \r\nalleged crimes involving more than 10,000 victims. We \r\ntherefore reiterate our call for the ICC to be provided \r\nwith the necessary resources to properly execute its \r\nmandate.\r\nCARICOM urges those States that have not yet \r\ndone so to pay their outstanding contributions in \r\norder to ensure that the Court is able to carry out its \r\nresponsibilities in an effective and efficient manner. We \r\nalso encourage States to make voluntary contributions \r\nto the Trust Fund for Victims, with a view to ensuring \r\nthat victims are provided with adequate reparations. \r\nFurther, in accordance with Article 115, sub-paragraph \r\nb, of the Rome Statute of the ICC and the relationship \r\nagreement between the United Nations and the ICC, \r\nCARICOM stresses that funds for expenses associated \r\nwith referrals by the Security Council should be \r\nprovided by the United Nations. We therefore reiterate \r\nour call for the United Nations to honour its obligations \r\nto meet the costs associated with Security Council \r\nreferrals to the ICC.\r\nCARICOM also underscores the importance of \r\nproper follow-up by the Security Council to ensure \r\ncooperation, in particular with regard to the arrest and \r\nsurrender of individuals, as without that cooperation \r\njustice will not prevail. We fully agree with the mention \r\nin the report of the Secretary-General that a perception \r\nof inactivity by the Council in terms of taking further \r\nmeasures to ensure that appropriate cases be brought to \r\ncourt could risk undermining the credibility of both the \r\nCourt and the Council.\r\nCARICOM takes note of the preliminary \r\nexaminations undertaken by the Office of the Prosecutor \r\non situations in various parts of the world and the \r\nconclusion of preliminary examinations elsewhere. \r\nWe also acknowledge the fact that investigations and \r\njudicial proceedings are ongoing in eight States. We \r\nalso commend the Prosecutor for seeking to discharge \r\nher mandate in a manner consistent with the provisions \r\nof the Rome Statute of the ICC.\r\nCARICOM remains fully committed to the \r\nprogressive development of the relationship between \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC as part of our overall \r\nsupport for the maintenance of an international regime \r\nbased on respect for the inalienable human rights of \r\nindividuals, respect for the territorial integrity of States \r\nand the need to bring to justice those who commit \r\nserious breaches of the provisions of the Rome Statute \r\n12/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nand other laws, which, in our view, represent customary \r\ninternational law.\r\nIn conclusion, CARICOM once more reiterates \r\nits steadfast support for the Court as it continues to \r\ndischarge its sacred mandate.\r\nMs. Lehto (Finland): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the five Nordic countries, namely, Denmark, \r\nIceland, Norway, Sweden and my own country, Finland.\r\nI would like to start by thanking the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for its annual report to the United \r\nNations (see A/70/350). I would also like to thank \r\nJudge Fernández de Gurmendi, President of the ICC, \r\nfor personally giving us a thorough presentation of the \r\nmain issues contained in the report.\r\nThe Nordic countries would like to express their \r\nsincere appreciation to the Court for its significant \r\ncontribution to the fight against impunity worldwide. \r\nFrom the report and President Fernández de Gurmendi’s \r\nintroduction, it is clear that the caseload of the Court \r\nhas continued to increase.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Office of the \r\nProsecutor conducted preliminary examination \r\nactivities in 10 situations, in Asia, Africa, the Middle \r\nEast, Europe and Latin America. Investigations by \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor now number eight, with \r\nthe opening of a new investigation in the situation of \r\nCentral African Republic. We also note that the Office \r\nof the Prosecutor recently requested authorization to \r\nopen a ninth investigation, in Georgia. In total, the \r\nCourt is now seized of 23 cases in nine situations. \r\nThose numbers are unprecedented in the history of the \r\nCourt. The activities of the Court are becoming truly \r\nworldwide. We commend the President, the Prosecutor \r\nand the entire Court for the dedicated and highly \r\nprofessional manner in which they carry out their work.\r\nThe Court is the most important international \r\nactor in efforts to fight impunity and in developing \r\ninternational criminal law. We stress the importance of \r\nstrong cooperation by States in order for the Court to \r\nbe truly able to carry out its task in the most effective \r\nway. Only in that way is it possible for the international \r\ncommunity and the Court to pursue the aim of ending \r\nimpunity for past crimes and preventing future ones \r\nfrom taking place. Both the Court and the States parties \r\nare part of the Rome Statute system of international \r\ncriminal justice, built upon the principles of \r\ncomplementarity, cooperation and shared responsibility \r\nto hold perpetrators of mass crimes accountable and to \r\nensure justice for victims.\r\nIt is a cause for concern that the number of \r\noutstanding arrest warrants remains high. States parties \r\nhave a legal obligation under the Rome Statute to \r\ncooperate fully with the Court. In addition, we strongly \r\nurge all States to strengthen their efforts to cooperate \r\nfully and effectively with the Court, in line with any \r\napplicable Security Council resolutions. States have \r\nthe primary responsibility to investigate and prosecute \r\ncrimes, as the ICC is a court of last resort. We must, \r\nhowever, acknowledge that many States affected by such \r\ncomplex and large-scale crimes as genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes lack the resources, \r\ncapacity or motivation to initiate investigations \r\nand conduct appropriate criminal proceedings. The \r\nNordic countries are prepared to assist States parties \r\nthat are willing to strengthen their national legal \r\ncapacities in that area. In that context, we highlight \r\nthe complementarity programme of the Justice Rapid \r\nResponse facility, which offers assistance, mentoring \r\nand modelling to States that are willing to investigate \r\nconflict-related international crimes.\r\nWe welcome the cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the ICC, as described in the report. We \r\nnote, however, that greater support to the Court on the \r\npart of the Security Council is still needed. That is true \r\nin particular in cases of non-cooperation with the Court \r\nand where there is a need for more effective follow-\r\nup of cases referred to it from the Security Council. \r\nWhile respecting the independence and integrity of \r\nthe Court, the Security Council must play its part in \r\nensuring accountability when gross violations and \r\nabuses of international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights law have occurred in any part of the world, as is \r\nmost acutely now the case in Syria. We strongly appeal \r\nto the Security Council to refer the Syrian situation to \r\nthe ICC. We also call upon Iraq to accede to the Rome \r\nStatute as a matter of priority. Persons responsible for \r\nwar crimes and other serious international crimes in \r\nthe region must be held accountable.\r\nIn order for the Court to be able to carry out its \r\ntask in the most efficient way, it needs to be properly \r\nfunded. The Court’s budget will be dealt with in the \r\nAssembly of the State Parties later this month, but we \r\nwish to underline the global activities of the Court. They \r\nare reflected in the Court’s report. It is our common \r\nresponsibility to ensure that the Court has sufficient \r\nresources to carry out its important mandate in a time \r\n15-35224 13/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nof ever-increasing demand. The Court’s budget needs \r\nto reflect adequately its increased caseload.\r\nVictims are, and should be, at the core of the \r\nCourt’s concern in its operations; they are a priority \r\nfor the Nordic countries. We especially commend the \r\nefforts of the Court, in cooperation with States and the \r\nUnited Nations, to strengthen international capacities \r\nto investigate and prosecute sexual and gender-based \r\ncrimes in order to bring justice to the victims of those \r\natrocious crimes. The surge in examinations and \r\ninvestigations is likely to increase the need to mobilize \r\nmore resources to help victims, and we encourage States \r\nto contribute to the ICC’s Trust Fund for Victims. We \r\nalso encourage the mobilization of private resources \r\nthrough public-private partnerships. We believe \r\nthat that source of funding is likely to become even \r\nmore important in the future, considering the current \r\neconomic outlook in many countries.\r\nThe full realization of victims’ rights to reparations \r\nand their procedural rights are an important aspect of \r\nthe continuing success and relevance of the Court. \r\nWe commend the important work of the Trust Fund \r\nin the various assistance projects for victims and their \r\nfamilies in the field. We also note the work being done \r\nby the Trust Fund in relation to the first-ever draft \r\nimplementation plan for reparations for victims, which \r\nwill be an important milestone for the Court.\r\nLet me conclude by renewing our pledge that the \r\nNordic countries will remain staunch supporters of the \r\nCourt. We are committed to continuing our support to \r\nthe Court’s independence and integrity.\r\nMr. Zellweger (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nAt the outset, I want to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for her report (see \r\nA/70/350), which has provided us with an excellent \r\nbasis for discussion today.\r\nRecently, many States have expressed their \r\ncommitment to the role played by the International \r\nCriminal Court in combating impunity. Mali has asked \r\nthe ICC to investigate the destruction of religious \r\nstructures, and the Niger handed over a suspect \r\nimplicated in the same affair. The Central African \r\nRepublic has encouraged the ICC to examine crimes \r\nrecently committed within its territory. Ukraine has \r\nallowed the Court to expand the scope of its preliminary \r\nexamination. And Palestine has ratified the Rome \r\nStatute, bringing the number of States parties to 123, or \r\ntwo thirds of all States in the world.\r\nThe ICC itself is making every effort to combat \r\nimpunity. Currently, the Court is undertaking \r\npreliminary examinations, investigations and judicial \r\nproceedings relating to situations throughout the \r\nworld: in Afghanistan, the Central African Republic, \r\nColombia, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, Georgia, Guinea, Iraq, Kenya, Libya, Mali, \r\nNigeria, Uganda, Palestine, the Sudan and Ukraine. The \r\nCourt has also issued important preventive statements, \r\nas was the case during the tensions that arose during \r\nelections in Burundi. Moreover, the ICC is examining \r\nhundreds of communications concerning numerous \r\nother places throughout the world.\r\nWhat can we conclude from the those facts? It \r\nis clear that the mission of the ICC and the support \r\nit provides are of a global scale. While some accuse \r\nthe ICC of being a political tool directed against high-\r\nranking officials, it is in fact an independent judicial \r\ninstitution serving thousands of victims. For that \r\nreason, the Court requires and deserves our support.\r\nRecently, there have been repeated discussions \r\nof whether it would be appropriate to establish ad \r\nhoc international tribunals when States have neither \r\nthe will nor capacity to prosecute the perpetrators of \r\ninternational crimes. That may be an option when the \r\nICC has no jurisdiction ratione temporis, as would \r\nhave been the case for the crimes committed in Chad \r\nin the 1980s. In other situations, recourse to the ICC \r\nis an obvious solution because of its established legal \r\nframework, fully funded budget and highly qualified \r\npersonnel. The decision to establish an international ad \r\nhoc tribunal because it is politically more convenient \r\nin the short-term will prove to be unsatisfactory in the \r\nlonger term. However, even when the ICC is resorted to, \r\nit will be able to try only perpetrators who bear primary \r\nresponsibility. Therefore, the creation of specialized \r\nnational courts to hear crimes not dealt with by the \r\nICC, as in the case of the Central African Republic, \r\nis to be welcomed. It breathes life into the principle of \r\ncomplementarity and allows for justice to be accorded \r\nto victims.\r\nI would now like to address the issue of cooperation \r\nbetween the ICC and the United Nations. As the report \r\nof the Court illustrates, such cooperation is increasingly \r\nbroad and deep. All the relevant United Nations entities \r\nwork regularly with the Court. Switzerland welcomes \r\nin particular the cooperation between the ICC and \r\nUnited Nations commissions of inquiry, groups and \r\nexpert panels, as well as efforts to institutionalize such \r\n14/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\ncooperation. We also welcome the joint work towards \r\nbuilding capacity in national jurisdictions so as to be \r\nable to address the most serious crimes.\r\nWhile cooperation is effective at that level, the \r\nrelationship with the Security Council is not as clear-cut. \r\nOn the one hand, the Council mandates peacekeeping \r\nmissions to support arrests being made, or even to \r\nexecute them directly. On the other hand, there are \r\nareas in which the Council could develop and support \r\nthe fight against impunity more than it is currently \r\ndoing. The most striking example in that respect is \r\nthe decision by the Council not to refer the situation in \r\nSyria to the ICC. The lack of response to the numerous \r\nICC communications about non-cooperation in referred \r\nsituations also attests to the apparent reluctance of \r\nthe Security Council to support the ICC fully. We \r\nwelcome the fact that the Court’s report addresses the \r\nissue of sanctions. Switzerland believes that we could \r\nstrengthen cooperation between the Court and the \r\nCouncil on sanctions issues and that dialogue should be \r\ninitiated in that regard.\r\nThe Court is facing an ever growing number \r\nof judicial activities. It is also confronted with \r\ngrowing, and at times conflicting, expectations from \r\nstakeholders. Their expectations must be matched by \r\npolitical and financial support. In order to maximize \r\nits impact, the Court needs to work as efficiently as \r\npossible. Switzerland therefore strongly supports the \r\nPresident of the Court, the Prosecutor and the Registrar \r\nin their efforts to enhance the efficacy of judicial \r\nprocedures and other processes at the ICC.\r\nIn conclusion, we encourage all States parties to \r\nratify the Kampala amendments to the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich consist of expanding the notion of war crimes in \r\nnon-international armed conflicts and defining crimes \r\nof aggression. Switzerland ratified those amendments \r\nearly in September. We also support a timely activation \r\nof the competencies of the ICC by the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties with respect to crimes of aggression, for \r\nthe very simple reason that preventing wars prevents \r\nwar crimes from being committed.\r\nMr. Adank (New Zealand): We welcome the \r\n2015 annual report (see A/70/350) of the International \r\nCriminal Court. We also appreciate the annual \r\nopportunity at the General Assembly to discuss the \r\nCourt’s activities, and in particular its relationship with \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nWe welcome the election of seven new judges. We \r\ncongratulate Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi of \r\nArgentina on her election as President of the Court, and \r\nsupport the observation that she made in March that the \r\nsuccess of the Court depends on both the cooperation \r\nof the international community and the performance \r\nof the Court. We look forward to engaging with her \r\non such issues in order to ensure that the Court is as \r\neffective and efficient as it can be.\r\nWe also thank His Excellency Mr. Sidiki Kaba, \r\nMinister of Justice of Senegal, who was elected \r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties, for his \r\nrecent efforts to strengthen the relationship between \r\nthe Court and States parties, including through \r\nin-country visits. We welcome his commitment to \r\nworking with all States parties to create the conditions \r\nnecessary for a constructive dialogue that is focused \r\non our common goal of ending impunity for crimes \r\nof concern to the international community as a \r\nwhole through national and international measures of \r\ncooperation. Looking ahead, we see value in providing \r\na regular space for constructive dialogue to take place, \r\nwhether in the Assembly of States Parties or other \r\nmore informal forums. In addition to the dialogue on \r\nrelationship issues, we acknowledge the President of \r\nthe Court’s important work aimed at promoting the \r\ncomplementarity and universality of the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich she spoke about today.\r\nThe workload of the Court is ever increasing. \r\nThe Court is currently seized of 21 cases and eight \r\nsituations. During the reporting period, the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor conducted preliminary examination \r\nactivities in seven situations and opened one new \r\ninvestigation. We welcome the efforts of the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor to develop its strategic plan for the period \r\n2016-2018, which will build on the lessons learned from \r\nthe current plan and identify pathways for the future.\r\nA critical success factor for the Court is its ability to \r\ncooperate and work with the United Nations at all levels. \r\nCooperation is central to the relationship agreement \r\nbetween the two organizations. We welcome the extra \r\nattention that the Court paid to that issue in its report, \r\nand we encourage it to continue to focus on practical \r\nmatters in future reports. It is important that all United \r\nNations offices, funds and programmes implement the \r\nobligation to cooperate, including through simple but \r\nsignificant actions such as continuing the practice of \r\nhigh-level consultations and ensuring that requests are \r\nresponded to. Such efforts and others, in particular \r\n15-35224 15/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nthe Court’s suggestions in relation to sanctions, are \r\nessential for a sustainable relationship built on mutual \r\ntrust and respect.\r\nAs the Court notes, peacekeeping missions provide \r\nvaluable assistance to the Court’s work and to host \r\nStates. Consistent with their mandates, such missions \r\nlend essential support to host States that are trying, \r\noften with limited capabilities, to cooperate with the \r\nCourt and ensure that the persons most responsible for \r\ninternational crimes are held to account. As a member \r\nof the Security Council, New Zealand is ever cognizant \r\nof the link between conflict prevention, peacebuilding \r\nand accountability for international crimes. \r\nNon-cooperation with binding Council resolutions that \r\nrefer situations to the Court is not only a critical issue \r\nfor the Court, but also goes to the heart of the Council’s \r\nown credibility. As previously expressed in the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council, referrals need to \r\nbe carefully considered, and the Council needs to have \r\na genuine commitment to support the implementation \r\nof the referrals it makes.\r\nNew Zealand shares the view of many present in \r\nthis Hall that countries need to be empowered and \r\nequipped with the tools to investigate and prosecute \r\ncrimes at the domestic level, in line with the principle \r\nof complementarity. We were reminded several \r\ntimes today that the Court is a court of last resort. \r\nAccountability ought to be pursued at a range of levels \r\nand in a manner that is appropriate to the specific \r\ncountry context.\r\nThe international community grappled for decades \r\nwith the question of whether the establishment of a \r\ncourt with permanent standing and jurisdiction over the \r\nmost serious international crimes was possible. Since \r\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute, in 1998, we have seen \r\nthe International Criminal Court develop its place in \r\nthe international legal landscape. Given the breadth, \r\ndepth and technical complexity of the Court’s work, the \r\nfuture will not be without its challenges.\r\nNew Zealand remains committed to working with \r\nothers to ensure that the Court continues to be regarded \r\nand perceived as a sustainable and effective judicial \r\ninstitution.\r\nMr. Pírez Pérez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Cuba takes note of the report (see \r\nA/70/350) of the International Criminal Court on its \r\nactivities in 2014 and 2015. We express our commitment \r\nto the fight against impunity for crimes of concern to \r\nthe international community.\r\nThe current international situation and the events \r\nthat have taken place in recent years are irrefutable \r\nproof of the need for an autonomous international \r\njuridical institution to maintain the fight against \r\nimpunity for the gravest crimes. However, given article \r\n16 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt and the broad powers granted to the Security \r\nCouncil with regard to the work of the Court, the \r\nreality that we see is not exactly that of an independent \r\ninstitution. That problem, besides undermining the \r\nessence of the Court’s jurisdiction, also violates the \r\nprinciple of the independence of judicial bodies, as \r\nwell as the transparency and impartiality needed in the \r\nadministration of justice.\r\nReferrals to the Court by the Security Council \r\nconfirm the negative trend that my country has witnessed \r\nand mentioned on several occasions. In the process of \r\nthe referrals by the Security Council, international \r\nlaw is constantly violated and developing countries \r\nare attacked in the name of the alleged fight against \r\nimpunity. That is why Cuba reiterates its position for \r\nthe establishment of an impartial criminal jurisdiction \r\nthat is not selective, but effective, fair, complementary \r\nto national justice systems, truly independent and \r\nthereby free from subordination to political interests \r\nthat could undermine its very essence.\r\nUnfortunately, the results of the first Review \r\nConference of the Rome Statute, which took place \r\nin Kampala in 2010, did not resolve the issues I have \r\nmentioned. The Court, as an organ with international \r\ncriminal jurisdiction, continues to be subjected to \r\nthe illegitimate, undemocratic and abusive acts of the \r\nSecurity Council, which violate international law. It is \r\nalso deplorable that some Security Council resolutions \r\nstipulate that crimes committed by the forces of some \r\nof the Powers that are Security Council members but \r\nnon-parties to the Rome Statute are excluded from \r\ninvestigation. Such referrals by the Security Council \r\nare offensive to the international community. They \r\nconstitute evidence of the political double standards in \r\nthe Security Council, and they violate the procedural \r\nprinciples of the International Criminal Court.\r\nThe delegation of Cuba reiterates that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court cannot ignore \r\ninternational treaties and the principles of international \r\nlaw. The Court must respect the legal principle relating \r\n16/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nto the consent of the State to be bound by a treaty, which \r\nappears in article 11 of part 2 of the Vienna Convention \r\non the Law of Treaties, of 23 May 1969.\r\nCuba reiterates its serious concern at the precedent \r\ncreated by the decisions of the Court to initiate legal \r\nproceedings against nationals of States not party to \r\nthe Rome Statute, which have not even accepted its \r\njurisdiction in accordance with article 12 of the same \r\ntreaty. As numerous reports and speakers have stressed, \r\nthe Rome Statute was never intended to replace national \r\ncourts. We should not forget that the jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court must be independent of \r\nthe political organs of the United Nations, and always \r\nfunction in a complementary manner in relation to \r\nnational penal jurisdictions.\r\nThe people of Cuba have been the victims of the most \r\ndiverse forms of aggression for 50 years. Harassment \r\nand aggression have left thousands of people dead and \r\ninjured in Cuba, hundreds of families have lost their \r\nchildren, parents, siblings, and innumerable trade, \r\nfinancial and material losses have occurred. However, \r\nthe definition of the crime of aggression reached at \r\nthe first Review Conference fell far short of taking \r\ninto account some of the elements I have mentioned. \r\nThe definition of the crime of aggression should be \r\nformulated in a generic manner and encompass all \r\nforms of aggression that occur in international relations \r\nbetween States. It should not be limited to the use of \r\narmed force, as aggression also affects sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity and the political independence of \r\nStates.\r\nThe International Criminal Court must report its \r\nactivities to the General Assembly on the basis of the \r\nprovisions of the relationship agreement between the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and the United Nations. \r\nCuba, although not a party to the International Criminal \r\nCourt, is ready to continue actively participating in the \r\nnegotiation processes relating to the Court, especially \r\nunder the agenda item “Report of the International \r\nCriminal Court”, which the General Assembly \r\nconsiders every year.\r\nCuba reaffirms its determination to combat \r\nimpunity and maintains its commitment to international \r\ncriminal justice and its attachment to the principles of \r\ntransparency, independence and impartiality and the \r\nunrestricted application and respect for international \r\nlaw.\r\nMs. Cooper (Australia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), Judge Sylvia Silvia Alejandra Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi, for her informative presentation. I also \r\ncongratulate her on her election as President and on \r\nbeing the first woman to hold that position.\r\nThis year we are celebrating the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations. It is fitting, \r\nin this anniversary year, to reflect on the many \r\naccomplishments of the United Nations. It is also time \r\nto take stock and consider how the United Nations and \r\nMember States can do more to respond to unanswered \r\nchallenges, including our failure to end impunity for \r\nserious international crimes. Unimaginable atrocities \r\nare being perpetrated daily in all corners of the globe: \r\nfrom the forced cannibalism recorded in the African \r\nUnion’s commission of inquiry on South Sudan to the \r\nindiscriminate bombing documented in the latest report \r\n(A/HRC/30/48) by the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights Independent \r\nInternational Commission of Inquiry on the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic. Yet to date those most responsible for those \r\nshocking acts have not been held to account. That is \r\ndespite the fact that history has demonstrated time and \r\nagain that the investigation and prosecution of serious \r\ninternational crimes is critical to the re-establishment \r\nof an inclusive and lasting peace and, in that way, to the \r\nprevention of the recurrence of such crimes.\r\nThe acknowledgment of those facts led the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to propose the \r\nestablishment of a permanent criminal court in the \r\nearly years of the United Nations. The recognition of \r\nthose facts also led States to conclude the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich established the International Criminal Court as \r\na critical part of the international peace and security \r\narchitecture some 50 years later.\r\nThe Court’s services are more in demand than ever. \r\nNine situations are currently before the Court, and \r\nanother nine are under preliminary examination. Each \r\nof those situations has come before the Court because \r\nStates with jurisdiction were either unwilling or unable \r\nto take action to hold alleged perpetrators to account.\r\nAs the President of the Central African Republic, \r\nCatherine Samba-Panza, explained when she addressed \r\nthe latest meeting of the ICC’s Assembly of States \r\nParties, her Government made a referral to the Court \r\nbecause it recognized that the Government could not \r\ndeliver justice alone. The Interim Government was \r\n15-35224 17/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nconvinced that reconciliation and lasting peace required \r\nthat justice be done, but accepted that the foundations \r\nof the judicial system in the Central African Republic \r\nhad collapsed. It therefore called on the Court for \r\nassistance — a brave decision that Australia commends.\r\nAustralia does not shy away from recognizing \r\nthat the Court has been asked to undertake a complex \r\nmandate. Collecting evidence in the midst of ongoing \r\nconflicts, providing protection to witnesses half way \r\naround the world and bringing forward cases against \r\nthose sitting atop chains of command are all tasks \r\nthat entail obvious challenges. But, distressingly, one \r\nof the greatest challenges facing the Court is a lack of \r\ncooperation from the same actors that have pledged to \r\nsave succeeding generations from the scourge of war \r\nand affirmed that the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community as a whole must not go \r\nunpunished.\r\nThe Court’s success in combating impunity for \r\nserious international crimes hinges on the degree of \r\ncooperation that it is afforded, not just by States parties \r\nand States obliged to cooperate with the Court by virtue \r\nof Security Council resolutions but also by non-party \r\nStates and regional and international organizations, \r\nincluding the United Nations. For that reason, Australia \r\nonce again calls on States that have not done so to \r\nratify the Rome Statute, as amended by the Kampala \r\namendments, in order to send a clear and universal \r\nmessage to would-be perpetrators that Rome Statute \r\ncrimes will not be tolerated.\r\nWe call on States to support a strong draft resolution \r\non the International Criminal Court this session, so as \r\nto demonstrate the commitment of Member States to \r\nthe Court. We call on the Security Council to enhance \r\nits cooperation with the Court, including by taking \r\nfollow-up action in relation to those situations that it \r\nhas referred to the Court, in order to turn the Council’s \r\nrhetoric on accountability into action.\r\nSecretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld famously \r\nsaid that the United Nations was not created to take \r\nus to heaven, but to save us from hell. The same can \r\nbe said of the International Criminal Court. The Court \r\nhas Australia’s unwavering support in that mission. \r\nWe trust that all Member States will agree that it is a \r\nworthy one.\r\nMr. Koch (Germany): The International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) was founded on our strong belief that \r\nsustainable peace and security can be based only on \r\njustice and the rule of law. That very notion is reflected \r\nin the preamble to the Rome Statute, which stipulates \r\nthat the crimes under the jurisdiction of the Court \r\n“threaten the peace, security and well-being of the \r\nworld”.\r\nThat is the spirit that makes the success of the ICC a \r\njoint endeavour on the part of all States parties, as they \r\nhave a genuine interest in ensuring an effective fight \r\nagainst impunity. The Court needs our support and \r\ndeserves its States parties’ unconditional cooperation \r\nso that it can fulfil its mandate. That is true because a \r\nlack of cooperation by States leaves the Court without \r\nmeans. It is even more true because a lack of cooperation \r\nseriously undermines the Court’s credibility as it seeks \r\nto perform its all-important work.\r\nBut support for the ICC concerns not only its States \r\nparties, but also the Security Council. As others have \r\nsaid before me, the Security Council’s involvement \r\ndoes not end with a decision to refer a situation to the \r\nICC. Rather, the Council needs to actively support the \r\nCourt’s work in following up on requests to investigate \r\na given situation. The Council therefore needs to take \r\na more sustained interest in the ICC’s work so as to \r\nsupport its credibility and, finally, the credibility of the \r\nideas on which the Court is based.\r\nMs. Rodrígues Pineda (Guatemala) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): We wish to congratulate Judge Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi on her election as President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC) and to \r\nthank her for her detailed and informative briefing, \r\nwhich we listened to with great interest. My delegation \r\nappreciates the annual exchanges between the United \r\nNations and the Court, not only because they strengthen \r\ninstitutional dialogue and the relationship between the \r\ntwo organizations but also because they serve to give \r\nvisibility to the vital work of the Court. I would like to \r\naddress the relationship that exists between the Court \r\nand the United Nations by highlighting four key areas.\r\nFirst, with regard to the Court and the General \r\nAssembly, States Members of the United Nations \r\nincreasingly recognize that the ICC is the central \r\nmechanism for the administration of international \r\ncriminal justice. The reality is that war crimes, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and genocide know no borders. \r\nWe must all join forces in the struggle against those \r\ncrimes. The success of the Court is therefore an issue \r\nthat concerns all Member States, be they States parties \r\nor not.\r\n18/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nWe must follow the path chosen 17 years ago with \r\nthe adoption of the Rome Statute and redouble our \r\nefforts to combat impunity. We must bear in mind the \r\nlong-term effects of the Court, which will be greater \r\nrespect for international law, including international \r\ncriminal law and international humanitarian law, and \r\nfor human rights and the rule of law. Ultimately, that \r\nwill contribute to international peace and justice in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nurge Member States that have not yet done so to become \r\nparties to the Rome Statute. Our appeal is particularly \r\nurgent at a time when we are about to witness the \r\ncessation of activities of the ad hoc international \r\ntribunals established by the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, with regard to the relationship between \r\nthe Court and the Security Council, the Council \r\nmust commit to effectively following up on its own \r\ndecisions regarding the specific situations that have \r\ngenerated a referral by the Council to the Court. It is \r\nthe responsibility of the Council to ensure compliance \r\nwith Court decisions, especially when Court judges \r\nhave noted and reported instances of non-cooperation. \r\nCurrently, there are 11 communications from the Court \r\nto the Council on the lack of cooperation with regard \r\nto Darfur and Libya, to which no response has yet been \r\nreceived.\r\nWe are concerned that there are States that are not \r\nhonouring their obligations under the Rome Statute \r\nand the Charter of the United Nations. Whenever the \r\nrule of law is defied and the Security Council does not \r\nprevent it, the rule of law is undermined. One way of \r\npreventing such undesirable situations from arising in \r\nthe first place, given the unwillingness of some States to \r\nexecute arrest warrants, would simply be not to extend \r\ninvitations to or accept visits of suspects subject to such \r\nwarrants. We also regret the Council’s reluctance to take \r\nadditional measures and to monitor the progress of the \r\nCourt, limiting itself to receiving regular reports from \r\nthe Prosecutor on country situations. That is a sign of \r\nindifference by the Council to upholding the rule of law \r\nin general, and to ensuring accountability in particular.\r\nThirdly, with regard to the relationship between \r\nthe Court and the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, the functions of that \r\nOffice include the use of a variety of early warning \r\nmeasures, including the submission of reports on \r\nsituations and issues of particular interest. Reports \r\nfrom commissions of inquiry and monitoring missions \r\nhave proved useful for corroborating information \r\nregarding the nature and severity of specific situations. \r\nSuch information can be especially advantageous for \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor in preliminary hearings, \r\nduring which publicly available information is used \r\nto determine whether there is a sufficient basis for \r\nconducting an investigation.\r\nWe support the recommendation in the Court’s \r\nreport (see A/70/350) for the continued pursuit of \r\nways to increase cooperation and coordination in \r\nsituations that fall within its jurisdiction, with a view to \r\nfacilitating an exchange of information in accordance \r\nwith the relationship agreement. In that regard, we look \r\nforward to the conclusion of a framework memorandum \r\nof understanding between the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nand the Office of the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights.\r\nFourthly, concerning the relationship between the \r\nCourt and the Secretariat, the Court is often faced \r\nwith complex situations in which the United Nations \r\nis attempting to achieve parallel objectives. For that \r\nreason, the United Nations is a crucial partner of \r\nthe Court and is often uniquely positioned to offer \r\nlogistical and security support on the ground. In that \r\nregard, we are pleased to welcome cooperation with the \r\nDepartment of Peacekeeping Operations through the \r\nconclusion of several memorandums of understanding \r\nwith some peacekeeping operations on the ground. \r\nWe would note the relevance of the point made in the \r\nrecent report of the High-level Independent Panel on \r\nPeacekeeping Operations (see A/70/95) to the effect \r\nthat a United Nations peacekeeping mission alone \r\ncannot take on all aspects of the judicial system and \r\nthat combined efforts are needed to achieve sustainable \r\nresults. That report adds that it is necessary to examine \r\nthe whole chain of institutions, including tribunals, \r\nand that they should collaborate efficiently. We believe \r\nthat the International Criminal Court, in accordance \r\nwith the principle of complementarity, can contribute \r\nto such operations by ensuring that the rule of law \r\nperforms effectively to combat impunity through the \r\nCourt’s support of the appropriate transitional justice \r\nmechanisms in cases where past violations have not \r\nbeen resolved and pose an obstacle to achieving a \r\ndurable peace.\r\nFurthermore, it is important to recall that the \r\nrelationship with the Secretariat is not confined to \r\npeacekeeping operations or to the Office of Legal \r\nAffairs, which provides unequivocal support to the \r\nCourt, but that it affects all aspects of the United \r\n15-35224 19/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nNations presence on the ground through its offices, \r\nfunds and programmes, as well as its humanitarian \r\noperations. We consider it essential that that \r\ncommitment to collaboration should be shouldered by \r\nall parts of the United Nations system, in accordance \r\nwith the Secretary-General’s policy and on the basis of \r\nthe relationship agreement. For example, we note that \r\nthe Court’s report points out that it has asked on various \r\noccasions for restrictions on documents from the United \r\nNations and other sources to be lifted in order for the \r\nCourt to be able to use them during trials. The report \r\nlikewise stresses the assistance provided by the United \r\nNations and related bodies with regard to making \r\navailable former officials to testify in trials. The annual \r\njoint round tables between the United Nations and the \r\nCourt provide a good opportunity for both entities to \r\nhold working sessions to discuss practical cooperation \r\nagreements, lessons learned and future challenges.\r\nIn conclusion, I once again reiterate Guatemala’s \r\nunwavering commitment to the International Criminal \r\nCourt and to the fight against impunity for grave crimes \r\nof concern to the international community.\r\nMr. Gâlea (Romania): The Romanian delegation \r\nthanks the International Criminal Court for its eleventh \r\nannual report (see A/70/350) to the United Nations.\r\nFirst of all, we would like to congratulate Judge \r\nSilvia Alejandra Fernández de Gurmendi on her election \r\nas President of the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\nWe also congratulate Mr. Sidiki Kaba on his election as \r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the ICC. I can ensure them both of Romania’s \r\ncommitment to, and full support for, their efforts.\r\nMy delegation equally welcomes the election of \r\nseven new judges, given the increasing workload and \r\nprospects faced by the Court. As the report highlights, \r\nthe ICC is currently dealing with 21 cases in eight \r\nsituations at different stages of proceedings, while the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor is conducting investigations \r\nand preliminary examinations in a significant number \r\nof cases. Next year is expected to be a very busy one, \r\nwith four trials taking place simultaneously.\r\nThe universality of the Rome Statute of the ICC \r\nis, in our view, the most powerful preventive approach. \r\nThis year marked Palestine’s accession to the Rome \r\nStatute and the declaration by Ukraine, which was \r\nsubmitted under article 12, paragraph 3, of the Rome \r\nStatute, accepting the jurisdiction of the Court for acts \r\ncommitted on its territory since 20 February 2014. We \r\ncontinue to encourage all States to become parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute.\r\nFrom our perspective, the ICC’s ability to deliver \r\njustice depends on the full cooperation of States. The \r\nfundamental challenge to the Court’s work remains \r\nthe need to ensure full and prompt cooperation with \r\nit, and in particular the need to react to instances of \r\nnon-cooperation. The Court’s efforts to ensure respect \r\nfor the rule of law must not be undermined. Victims face \r\nthe prospect of remaining victims forever when justice \r\nfails to fulfil its basic role. States should be aware of \r\nthe significant role that they play in the fulfilment of \r\ninternational justice in compliance with their legal \r\nobligations stemming from the Rome Statute and/or the \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe ICC remains a court of last resort, \r\ncomplementing national jurisdictions. Therefore, \r\nthe effective implementation of the principle of \r\ncomplementarity is particularly important if the \r\npotential of the Rome Statute is to be fully realized. \r\nWe commend the positive example of the situation in \r\nGuinea, as described in the report, and the efforts of all \r\nthe actors involved.\r\nThe report equally illustrates the importance of \r\nthe relationship between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, as well as the need for \r\nunwavering political support and follow-up action by \r\nthe Security Council to address issues arising from \r\nreferrals to the ICC made by the Council in accordance \r\nwith the Rome Statute. We express our support for \r\nestablishing a mechanism that would ensure effective \r\nfollow-up to such referrals. Romania remains an active \r\nand strong supporter of the International Criminal \r\nCourt and continues to promote its work, which is \r\ncrucial for international peace and justice.\r\nThe Romanian delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatement delivered on behalf of the European Union \r\nand its Member States.\r\nMr. Logar (Slovenia): Allow me to begin by \r\nextending Slovenia’s heartfelt congratulations to the \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nJudge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, on her election \r\nand to thank her for introducing the annual report of the \r\nCourt (see A/70/350).\r\nSlovenia welcomes today’s opportunity to engage \r\nin a discussion on the work of the Court. The report \r\nreaffirms the continuous increase in the workload of the \r\n20/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nCourt, as well as the scale and versatility of its efforts \r\nto bring justice to victims — all of which attests to the \r\ngrowing role of the Court in establishing accountability \r\nfor the most serious crimes under international law. \r\nWith the transition of the Court to its new permanent \r\npremises, the Court will be able to conduct an \r\nunprecedented number of trials simultaneously, leading \r\nto an even greater pace for the Court in 2016. Since \r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the Court in fighting \r\nimpunity largely depend on the level of commitment \r\nof the international community, it is crucial that we do \r\nour share.\r\nI would like to focus in my statement on four \r\nkey areas of particular importance, which are also \r\nhighlighted in the report before us, namely the \r\nrelationship between the ICC and the United Nations, \r\nStates’ cooperation with the ICC, the principle of \r\ncomplementarity and universality.\r\nOne of the underlying aspirations of the United \r\nNations is to establish conditions under which, according \r\nto preamble of the statute of the Court, “Justice and \r\nrespect for the obligations can be maintained”. With \r\nthe principles and powers enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, the United Nations is a vital \r\npartner of the ICC in establishing accountability for \r\natrocity crimes. Slovenia therefore welcomes the \r\nhighly valuable cooperation between the ICC and the \r\nUnited Nations, including in the form of information \r\nexchange, logistical support and security assistance, \r\ninvolving not only United Nations Headquarters, but \r\nalso United Nations peacekeeping missions and other \r\nUnited Nations presence in the field.\r\nAs is evident from the report, the ICC-United \r\nNations relationship has seen notable progress in recent \r\nyears, which is highly commendable. While fully \r\nappreciative of those developments, my delegation \r\nwould like to refer to several priorities and priority \r\nareas where we see room for further improvements. Let \r\nme begin with the role of the Security Council.\r\nWith the powers vested in the Security Council, \r\nincluding the ability to refer situations to the ICC, \r\nthe Council is a particularly important partner of the \r\nICC, and its support has a great potential impact on the \r\nefficiency of the Court. However, 11 unanswered Court \r\ncommunications to the Security Council, concerning \r\nnon-cooperation regarding Darfur and Libya and a \r\ngeneral lack of policy with respect to referrals, attest \r\nto the fact that greater efforts are needed to further \r\nenhance the cooperation between the Security Council \r\nand the Court. There is a clear need for a better follow-\r\nup to the referred situations on the part of the Security \r\nCouncil. Moreover, the full implementation of the \r\nRelationship Agreement and better use of the Security \r\nCouncil’s sanctions system in cases of persons sought \r\nby the Court under an arrest warrant would also, and \r\nimportantly, advance the Court’s efforts and efficiency. \r\nIn that regard, Slovenia would like to reaffirm its \r\nsupport for initiatives urging permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council to refrain from using the veto in \r\nsituations of atrocity crimes.\r\nFurther improvements would also be welcome \r\nconcerning the mainstreaming of the Court in the United \r\nNations system and the role of peacekeeping missions. \r\nSlovenia welcomes the concrete recommendations in \r\nthe report on how to further strengthen both areas of \r\nconcern, and stresses the need to examine ways they \r\ncould be implemented. Therefore, it is essential that we \r\nmake the best use of it to raise awareness and political \r\nsupport for the Court and to create greater synergies \r\namong the relevant actors in the field of human rights, \r\npeace and security and international criminal justice.\r\nWith the broad United Nations presence on the \r\nground, we believe that its potential for cooperation \r\nwith the Court is vast. What we need to ensure, however, \r\nis that the peacekeeping mission mandates allow for \r\nthe most effective cooperation with the Court and host \r\nStates. Just as the Court needs effective support and \r\ncooperation from the United Nations, it requires full \r\nand prompt cooperation from Member States. It is \r\ncritical to understand that cooperation with the ICC \r\nis not a choice; it is a legal obligation, as defined in \r\nthe Rome Statute. To date, 12 arrest warrants remain \r\noutstanding — some for several years — including \r\nthat of Omar Al-Bashir. A lack of cooperation on \r\nthe part of States seriously undermines the Court. \r\nSlovenia therefore calls on States to comply with their \r\ninternational obligations.\r\nThe third area of importance for the functioning \r\nof the Court, which I would like to address today, \r\nis the principle of complementarity. As the report \r\nrightly states, “Ending impunity is not the preserve \r\nof any one institution” (A/70/350, para. 101 (a)). As \r\nother delegations have noted, the Court is a court of \r\nlast resort and can prosecute only a limited number of \r\nindividuals. What we need is the proper and effective \r\nimplementation of the principle of complementarity. \r\nThat, however, requires appropriate national legislation, \r\n15-35224 21/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nthe necessary capacities and inter-State cooperation. \r\nSlovenia, together with Argentina, Belgium and the \r\nNetherlands, is actively engaged in such efforts, in \r\nparticular through an initiative to adopt a multilateral \r\ntreaty for mutual legal assistance and extradition for \r\nthe domestic prosecution of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to invite all States to join nearly 50 other \r\nStates in supporting that initiative.\r\nTurning to the important issue of universality, \r\nSlovenia remains committed to promoting the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute and the Kampala \r\namendments. We believe that it is only through \r\nuniversal outreach that the ICC can truly develop to \r\nits full potential. However, attaining that goal will \r\nrequire active engagement on the part of international \r\nand regional organizations, States and civil society. \r\nWith that in mind, this year Slovenia organized two \r\ninternational conferences that put international criminal \r\njustice at the top of the agenda: the Rights for Peace: \r\nChallenges and Opportunities conference in April, \r\nand the annual international Bled Strategic Forum in \r\nSeptember. The Forum included panels dedicated to \r\nending sexual violence in conflict and strengthening \r\nthe fight against impunity. Our commitment to \r\npromoting universality has been further affirmed by \r\nthe action plan on universality, adopted in September \r\nin the framework of the informal ministeral network \r\nsupporting the ICC. Slovenia takes this opportunity to \r\nonce again call on all States to join the ICC, ratify the \r\nKampala amendments and, in so doing, affirm their \r\ncommitment to accountability and respect for human \r\nrights.\r\nTo conclude, Slovenia remains firmly committed \r\nto advocating and promoting the rule of law and \r\ninternational criminal justice. Global peace and security \r\ncan be possible only with the advancement of the well-\r\nbeing of nations, respect for human rights and the rule \r\nof law. The ICC is an important tool for the prevention \r\nand prosecution of atrocity crimes, and deserves our \r\nstrong political commitment and cooperation, as well \r\nas our full respect for its independence and integrity. \r\nLet us do our share.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): Sudan \r\nunderscores the importance of the noble objectives that \r\nprevailed when the United Nations was established. \r\nThese include the maintenance of peace and security, \r\nsustainable development, and the protection of human \r\nrights through an approach based on international \r\ncooperation and dialogue aimed at the development \r\nof friendly relations and the peaceful settlements of \r\ndisputes. To this end, the Charter of the United Nations \r\nsets forth the principles of the equality and sovereignty \r\nof States, non-interference in the internal affairs of \r\nother States, and respect for the political independence \r\nand territorial integrity of States. Such international \r\ncooperation is the way we will withstand all challenges, \r\nincluding those in the economic, social and political \r\nareas. We must refrain from using or threatening to use \r\nviolence.\r\nAvoiding impunity is one of international justice’s \r\nloftiest goals. We all agree on the importance of \r\nthis principle. It is the responsibility of the national \r\njudicial and legal authorities to uphold this principle \r\nwith the support of relevant national legislation. \r\nThe politicization of international justice and the \r\nmanipulation of justice to serve narrow interests \r\nare inconsistent with the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to achieve justice and implement the \r\nprinciples and purposes set forth in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Such politicization increases \r\ntension in international relations and infringes upon \r\nthe established rules of international law instead of \r\npromoting it in fulfilment of one of the main purposes \r\nfor which the United Nations was founded.\r\nAs we review the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (see A/70/350), we should remind \r\nourselves of the relationship between the United \r\nNations and the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nwhich is based on the independence and discreteness \r\nof each entity and the non-existence of any organic or \r\nstructural relationship between them. We note with \r\nconcern that a number of States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the ICC are trying to transform the General \r\nAssembly into an assembly of States parties to the \r\nRome Statute. The Sudan has voiced a strong objection \r\nagainst this trend, which has been clearly expressed in \r\nthe ICC annual report.\r\nThe authors of the report have proposed new \r\nprovisions that might lead to interpretations that do not \r\nreflect the letter or spirit of the relationship agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the ICC. These \r\nproposals should not be used to support arguments in \r\nfavour of merging the ICC with the United Nations \r\nsystem. The Court must remain independent and should \r\nact in accordance with unambiguous provisions that \r\nserve as a balanced legal framework for its operations. \r\nThe Sudan has clearly expressed its position in informal \r\n22/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nconsultations on the Court’s draft special decisions, \r\nand we will not change that position.\r\nIn its recent practice, the ICC has shown that it has \r\nbecome a tool of international conflict and a political \r\naction mechanism, particularly through its special \r\nfocus on Africa and through its targeting of African \r\nleaders and symbols, to such an extent that African \r\npublic opinion describes the ICC as a court of big States \r\nbearing down on developing countries. A number of \r\nquestions impose themselves in that regard. What is \r\nthe ICC position with respect to crimes in non-African \r\nregions? Why does the ICC ignore those crimes? Is it \r\nnot an international court entrusted with the task of \r\npreventing impunity whenever and wherever crimes are \r\nperpetrated? Where are the principles of impartiality, \r\nindependence and integrity as the main pillars of the \r\npractice of the Court?\r\nThese questions, which we have raised and continue \r\nto raise, are very difficult ones, but we have not received \r\nany rational or convincing response. The current \r\npractices of the ICC and the persons representing it \r\nprovide a clear answer — the ICC’s only mandate is \r\nto target Africans and African States and nobody else. \r\nI would ask members to read the list of situations and \r\ncases in the report. The list contains situations in eight \r\ncountries of the world, which is enough to provide \r\nadditional proof of what I am saying. All the listed \r\nsituations are in African States; this is by no means a \r\ncoincidence; far from it.\r\nThe relationship between the ICC and the Security \r\nCouncil is an explicit illustration of politicization. \r\nThere should be no such relationship between a body \r\nentrusted with achieving international justice and \r\nanother political body driven by political interests and \r\ncalculations — the same body that refers cases that \r\noccur in certain countries while excluding others. This \r\nrelationship typifies the blurry distinction between \r\njustice as a principle that unites humankind at large, on \r\nthe one hand, and the political calculations that are so \r\ninconsistent with the principle of equity, on the other \r\nhand.\r\nThe reports of the Secretary-General on the ICC and \r\nits relationship with the United Nations should respect \r\nthe spirit and letter of the Relationship Agreement \r\nwithout advocating for the merger between the ICC and \r\nthe United Nations system. Furthermore, the Sudanese \r\ndelegation expresses its concern regarding the explicit \r\ninterference of the ICC in the work of the Secretariat, \r\nwith its efforts to instruct Secretariat staff on how to \r\ndeal with Member States or asking Member States to \r\nsend reports and explanations on how they implement \r\ntheir obligations.\r\nWe are not the only ones concerned about the \r\nharmful impact of voluntary contributions on the \r\nCourt’s integrity and independence. We are not the \r\nonly ones to express their deep concern — I repeat, \r\ndeep concern — with respect to the principle of \r\ncomplementarity described in the Rome Statute. I am \r\nspeaking of the ambiguity that was described by the \r\nfirst President of the ICC as a positive ambiguity, a \r\n“constructive ambiguity”. Unfortunately, this so-called \r\nconstructive ambiguity is the same principle that has \r\nbecome hostage to political interpretation to such an \r\nextent that it has led a European Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs to say that ICC jurisdiction does not apply to \r\nhis own State.\r\nThe principle of equality should not be based on \r\nconstitutional rights as was stated by a previous speaker, \r\nnot because it is part of international customary law \r\nalone, but because equality at its core means that there \r\nshould be no distinction between persons based on their \r\nnationality or the State with which they are affiliated. \r\nHowever, the factual reality of the Court is that such \r\ndistinctions are made, which is an explicit abuse of the \r\nprinciples of justice and good conscience.\r\nMy State reiterates that we should avoid impunity \r\nand achieve justice through competent legal bodies. \r\nFurthermore, we categorically refuse to deal with \r\ninternational bodies that we are not States parties to, in \r\naccordance with the Vienna Convention on the Law of \r\nTreaties between States and International Organizations \r\nor between International Organizations.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nPeru welcomes with interest the report (see A/70/350) \r\nof the International Criminal Court on its activities \r\nin 2014 and 2015, which has been submitted to \r\nthe General Assembly pursuant to article 6 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court. It also wishes \r\nto welcome the election of seven new judges and in \r\nparticular the election of the President of the Court, \r\nJudge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, who is an \r\nillustrious representative of our region. Peru reiterates \r\nits recognition of the work of the Court’s organs, which \r\nis carried out in strict compliance with the provisions \r\n15-35224 23/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nof the Rome Statute and is not subordinate to any other \r\nkind of consideration.\r\nTwelve years after its creation, the International \r\nCriminal Court has a heavy workload, consisting of 21 \r\ncases and 8 situations. We also know that in 2016, the \r\nCourt will be even more active, with an unprecedented \r\ncaseload. Peru is therefore pleased that in December \r\nthe Court will move to its permanent headquarters. \r\nNevertheless, we also recognize that the Court can \r\ncontinue to improve its efficiency. In that regard, Peru \r\nis honoured to serve as a focal point for Cluster I, which \r\nis focused on increasing the efficiency of the criminal \r\nprocess, of the Study Group on Governance of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties. In that regard, we support \r\nthe adoption of practical measures, in accordance with \r\nthe Rome Statute, to expedite proceedings and improve \r\nthe efficiency of the Court, provided that they do not \r\nundermine due process or the rights of the parties and \r\nvictims.\r\nDespite that progress, Peru recognizes that \r\ninternational criminal justice continues to be a lofty \r\ngoal and that the International Criminal Court, a young \r\ninstitution on the international scene, needs more \r\nsupport and a high level of cooperation. Such support \r\nshould come not just from the States parties to the \r\nRome Statute, but rather from all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations. In that regard, Peru expresses deep \r\nconcern about the problems linked to the financing \r\nof the Court, in particular in relation to referrals by \r\nthe Security Council, which are funded by the States \r\nparties to the Statute alone instead of by all the States \r\nMembers of our Organization. Similarly, we reiterate \r\nour concern with regard to the meagre progress \r\nreflected in the recent General Assembly resolutions \r\non the report of the Court, and we hope that during \r\nthe current session fruitful discussions can be held to \r\nachieve a substantive resolution that is fully supported \r\nby the entire international community and will help the \r\nfight against international impunity.\r\nI shall now briefly refer to the need to keep \r\nmoving forwards towards comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, particularly in relation to its working \r\nmethods and the use of the veto. That is especially \r\nrelevant given the imperative of preventing atrocity \r\ncrimes. Indeed, when a State cannot fulfil its sovereign \r\nresponsibility to protect its population, we have noted \r\nthat the international community has failed to respond \r\nadequately and the Security Council has been unable \r\nto fulfil its primary responsibility for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. Therefore, Peru \r\nsupports the French initiative and the initiative of the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency group \r\nregarding a code of conduct on Security Council \r\nresolutions to prevent mass atrocities.\r\nAs a member of the Informal Ministerial Network \r\nfor the International Criminal Court, Peru attaches \r\nthe greatest importance to the universality of the \r\nRome Statute. Indeed, in the context of the Ministerial \r\nNetwork, we have recently adopted an action plan, \r\nwhich is an important step towards that end. Therefore, \r\nwe take this opportunity to call upon the States that \r\nhave not yet done so to consider ratifying the Statute, \r\npreferably in its 2010 version.\r\nPeru is a peaceful and stable country that has \r\novercome serious internal conflicts over the course \r\nof its history. That was possible thanks to the \r\nimplementation of genuine accountability mechanisms, \r\nwhich are the best way to prevent the recurrence of \r\nserious human rights violations. We therefore reaffirm \r\nour commitment to the struggle against international \r\nimpunity, as well as to the work of the International \r\nCriminal Court, which is the best-placed institution \r\nfor ensuring that the most serious crimes do not go \r\nunpunished.\r\nMr. Pressman (United States of America): I \r\nthank President Gurmendi for her presentation of the \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nbetween 1 August 2014 and 31 July 2015, and for her \r\nservice to the Court in this first year of her tenure as \r\nPresident.\r\nEnding impunity for those responsible for war \r\ncrimes, crimes against humanity and genocide is \r\nsomething that the United States views as both a moral \r\nimperative and a stabilizing force in international affairs. \r\nTo that end, the United States continues to work, on a \r\ncase-by-case basis and consistent with United States \r\npolicy and laws, with the International Criminal Court \r\nto identify practical ways to advance accountability for \r\nthe worst crimes known to humankind. Together, the \r\ninternational community must find ways to intensify \r\nits collaboration to bring to justice the perpetrators of \r\natrocity crimes.\r\nThis past year has been marked by some progress. \r\nIn January, the United States welcomed the transfer \r\nof Dominic Ongwen by Central African authorities to \r\nthe ICC, which occurred thanks to close cooperation \r\nbetween the Court, the Central African Republic, \r\n24/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nUganda, the African Union Regional Task Force and \r\nthe United States. Ongwen is allegedly responsible \r\nfor committing and directing brutal crimes in Uganda \r\nand the region. The fact that he will now stand trial at \r\nthe ICC is a welcome and long-overdue step towards \r\njustice for the victims of the Lord’s Resistance Army. \r\nThe United States was pleased to work with its partners \r\nto help make that happen. We look forward to the day \r\nwhen Joseph Kony, too, will be held accountable.\r\nThe United States also recently welcomed the \r\nannouncement by the ICC Prosecutor in September that \r\nAhmad Al-Faqi Al-Mahdi, an alleged member of the \r\nIslamic extremist group Ansar Eddine, was surrendered \r\nto the Court by the authorities of the Niger, with the \r\ncooperation of Mali. That is an important step towards \r\nholding accountable those responsible for serious \r\ncrimes in Mali and towards holding accountable alleged \r\nmembers of extremist groups for war crimes. The \r\ncharges against Al-Faqi signal progress in bringing to \r\njustice those accused of intentionally targeting attacks \r\nagainst religious and historic buildings and monuments. \r\nSuch assaults are not just on Mali and its people, but on \r\nthe common cultural heritage of all humankind. Those \r\nare attacks against civilization and a tragedy for all \r\ncivilized people, and, as Secretary of State John Kerry \r\nhas said, the civilized world must take a stand. The \r\nUnited States commends Mali and the Niger on their \r\ncooperativeness in transferring Al-Faqi to the Court.\r\nThe United States also welcomes the Court’s report \r\nof continued cooperation with peacekeeping missions \r\nthat have been authorized by the Security Council to \r\nprovide support to appropriate justice and accountability \r\ninitiatives. We recognize with particular appreciation \r\nthe contributions of UN-Women to the work of the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor through the secondment of \r\ngender experts. At a time when we continue to witness \r\nthe commission of horrific sexual and gender-based \r\nviolence and crimes against women and girls and \r\nboys and men in atrocity situations around the world, \r\nwe must remain vigilant in our fight to prevent, end \r\nand hold to account those responsible for these most \r\nheinous crimes. The United States remains committed \r\nto pursuing justice for victims of sexual and gender-\r\nbased violence, including through strengthening the \r\nability of national authorities to address these crimes, \r\nwhich we are doing in countries like the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo.\r\nThe ICC was established as a court of last resort, \r\none that would focus on those deemed most responsible \r\nfor the most serious crimes and one that would step in to \r\ninvestigate and prosecute such persons only when States \r\nare not willing or genuinely able to do so themselves. \r\nOur support for domestic accountability efforts must \r\nbe integral to our approach collectively to ending \r\nimpunity for atrocity crimes. We welcome the progress \r\nmade in the Central African Republic to establish \r\na special criminal court, within its domestic system, \r\nbut with international participation. This represents an \r\nimportant step towards providing accountability at the \r\nnational level for the crimes committed amid the ongoing \r\nbrutal violence in the Central African Republic, while \r\nsimultaneously bolstering national-level capacity. The \r\nspecial criminal court could demonstrate the potential \r\nof positive complementarity, whereby international \r\nscrutiny and activity have stimulated and supported the \r\ncapacity of the domestic judiciary to bring justice to \r\nvictims.\r\nIn closing, it is important to note that there is still \r\nmuch to be done in our work together to prevent mass \r\natrocities and bring to justice those who commit crimes \r\nagainst humanity, war crimes and genocide. Facing \r\nlimited resources and increasing demands, it will be \r\nimportant for the Court to make prudent decisions about \r\nthe cases it pursues and declines to pursue and ensure \r\nthat its choices are guided by justice, rigour, fairness \r\nand care. The international community should strive \r\nto ensure that the Court is able to remain focused on \r\nits core mandate to address war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and genocide, and the Court should remain \r\nfocused on achieving concrete and just results.\r\nWe note, in this regard, that the United States \r\ncontinues to have serious concerns about the amendments \r\non the crime of aggression adopted at Kampala, which \r\nwe believe would risk undermining not only the Court’s \r\nwork to prevent and punish atrocity crimes, but other \r\nlegitimate efforts to do so as well. If States do not have \r\nclarity on what conduct is covered, it is easy to imagine \r\nthe complications and the chilling effect that would \r\narise in any number of situations where the imperative \r\nfor action, including by our partners and allies who \r\nare parties to the Rome Statute, is overwhelming, \r\nincluding action aimed at stopping the very atrocities \r\nthat prompted the Court’s creation. Imagine — in such \r\na situation after the Court’s aggression jurisdiction \r\nhas been activated — the questions States would face \r\nabout whether the Court would regard as aggression \r\na decision to join or support a coalition to prevent a \r\nhumanitarian catastrophe.\r\n15-35224 25/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\nIt is in this context that we stress that we all have an \r\ninterest in seeking greater clarity on key issues before \r\nany decision is taken to activate the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover the crime of aggression, including with regard both \r\nto what conduct is covered and also to which States are \r\ncovered. States should not have to decide whether to \r\nactivate the amendments without clear and common \r\nunderstanding on these points. We look forward to \r\ncontinued cooperation with the United Nations and our \r\ninternational partners on these most important matters.\r\nMr. Auväärt (Estonia): Estonia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union. In my national capacity, please allow \r\nme to make the following remarks.\r\nI thank President Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi \r\nfor her presentation of the report (see A/70/350) of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) on its activities \r\nin 2014/15 and congratulate her on her election. The \r\nreport illustrates the continuously increasing caseload \r\nof the Court, which in turn reflects the worldwide \r\ndemand for justice. There are now 21 cases and eight \r\nactive situations under the Court’s consideration, of \r\nwhich a considerable number were referred to the Court \r\nby the States themselves. In addition, the Prosecutor is \r\nseized with numerous communications and preliminary \r\nanalysis from all over the world and next year, for the \r\nfirst time, the Court will deal with four different trials \r\ntaking place simultaneously. In this regard, we note the \r\nimportant internal reforms and evaluation by the Court \r\nin order to make its work more efficient. Estonia hopes \r\nthat States parties will keep the growing workload of the \r\nCourt in mind when negotiating the Court’s budget at \r\nthe upcoming Assembly session and provide the Court \r\nwith the necessary resources to fulfil its mandate.\r\nWith respect to the past year, we note the ratification \r\nof the Rome Statute by the State of Palestine and the \r\nsecond declaration by Ukraine accepting the exercise of \r\njurisdiction by the Court over alleged crimes committed \r\nin Ukraine’s territory since 20 February 2014. Estonia \r\nhopes that Ukraine will also promptly ratify the Rome \r\nStatute to enjoy the full protection of the Rome Statute \r\nsystem. We welcome the fact that, during the reporting \r\nperiod, six States ratified the Kampala amendments and \r\neight States ratified or accepted the amendments to the \r\nStatute on the crime of aggression. Estonia reiterates \r\nits call on all United Nations Members that have not yet \r\ndone so to ratify the Rome Statute.\r\nWhile the ICC is an independent judicial institution, \r\nit is connected to the United Nations through its \r\ngenesis and shared values. This natural relationship \r\nwas institutionalized 11 years ago, in 2004, through the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court. The Agreement \r\nprovides a general framework for cooperation for \r\nthese two institutions. We appreciate the continued \r\ncooperation and assistance the Court receives from \r\nthe United Nations, and we further encourage the \r\nstrengthening of the relationship between the Court and \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nEstonia recognizes the important judicial \r\ndevelopments during the reporting period with the \r\nCourt’s first two appeals judgements in the situation \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the transfer \r\nand subsequent proceeding in the Dominic Ongwen \r\ncase, and the confirmation of charges against Charles \r\nBlé Goudé in the situation in Côte d’Ivoire. We also \r\nnote the first appearance of Ahmad Al-Faqi Al-Mahdi \r\nbefore the ICC, who allegedly was involved in the \r\ndestruction of historical and religious monuments in \r\nTimbuktu and therefore constitutes the first case before \r\nthe ICC concerning this type of crime. Furthermore, \r\nwe recognize the Prosecutor’s progress in her work on \r\nthe situation in Georgia and note her assignment of the \r\nsituation to the Pre-Trial Chamber in order to open an \r\ninvestigation into the situation.\r\nThe Security Council has authorized the missions \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Mali to \r\ncooperate with and support the Court. We encourage \r\nthe Security Council to mandate peacekeeping \r\nmissions to arrest ICC fugitives and to equip them \r\nin such a manner that the missions are able to fulfil \r\ntheir mandate. We recommend this in the light of the \r\n12 outstanding warrants of arrest issued by the Court \r\nand the fundamental goal of the Council to prevent mass \r\natrocities, which constitute a threat to international \r\npeace and security. Estonia also calls upon all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to contribute to ending \r\nimpunity by working together to execute the pending \r\narrest warrants.\r\nConsidering that the Office of Legal Affairs is the \r\nfocal point for ensuring cooperation within the entire \r\nUnited Nations system on all aspects of the relationship \r\nwith the Court, Estonia encourages all United Nations \r\nactors to systematize their cooperation with the Office \r\nof Legal Affairs.\r\n26/27 15-35224\r\nA/70/PV.48 05/11/2015\r\nThe failure to bring individuals responsible for the \r\nmost serious crimes under international law to justice \r\nmeans failing the victims of these crimes. The victims \r\nare the raison d’être of the Rome Statute system. The \r\nCourt has given hope to the victims of atrocity crimes, \r\nand more than 200,000 victims have already benefited \r\ndirectly or indirectly from the concrete assistance \r\nprogrammes of the ICC Trust Fund for Victims. We \r\nwelcome the progress made by the Court in the Lubanga \r\ncase concerning the policy on reparations. Estonia is \r\ncontributing again this year to the Trust Fund and we \r\ncall upon others to do the same.\r\nIn conclusion, given the States’ primary \r\nresponsibility to ensure accountability, it is of the \r\nutmost importance that States, the United Nations and \r\nother international, regional and non-governmental \r\norganizations assist States in building the national \r\ncapacity to investigate and prosecute Rome Statute \r\ncrimes domestically. The increasing attention that the \r\nUnited Nations has recently given to the strengthening \r\nof domestic capacity to address crimes under the Rome \r\nStatute is most welcome, and Estonia hopes that these \r\nefforts will continue. Estonia has allocated development \r\ncooperation resources to promote the strengthening of \r\nnational judicial capacity in this regard, working closely \r\nwith civil society organizations, which play a crucial \r\nrole in assisting States to bring domestic legislation \r\ninto line with the Rome Statute, and we call upon all \r\nMember States in a position to do so to do the same.\r\nMs. Krasa (Cyprus): At the outset, we would like \r\nto congratulate President Fernández de Gurmendi on \r\nher election as President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) and to thank her for her comprehensive \r\npresentation of the report (see A/70/350) covering \r\nthe period from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015. My \r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe observer of the European Union and would like to \r\ndeliver additional remarks in its national capacity.\r\nThe Republic of Cyprus is pleased to participate in \r\ntoday’s consideration of the annual report and would like \r\nto reiterate its conviction that the Court significantly \r\ncontributes to the overall goal of the United Nations \r\nto work towards a more just and peaceful world, \r\nserving in this way the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Given the connecting \r\nand complementary mandates of the United Nations \r\nand the Court, the relationship between the United \r\nNations and the Court, as formalized in the 2004 \r\nrelationship agreement between the United Nations and \r\nthe International Criminal Court, is significant.\r\nThe Republic of Cyprus is pleased to note that, during \r\nthe reporting period, the United Nations continued to \r\nwork closely with the Court to further strengthen the \r\nrelationship and to ensure the effective implementation \r\nof the relationship agreement. As reflected in the report, \r\nthe Court had another very full year in terms of judicial \r\nproceedings, investigations, preliminary investigations \r\nand institutional developments, a pace of work that \r\nis likely to continue to intensify in the subsequent \r\nperiod. Cyprus acknowledges the important judicial \r\ndevelopments in the reporting period and will continue \r\nto follow closely developments in the 21 cases and eight \r\nsituations currently before the Court. We also welcome \r\nthe fact that the Office of the Prosecutor is giving \r\nparticular attention to allegations concerning attacks \r\nagainst cultural heritage and buildings dedicated to \r\nreligion and, in this regard, welcome progress in \r\nthe Ahmad Al-Faqi Al-Mahdi case. In the light of \r\nthese developments, the further strengthening of the \r\nrelationship between the United Nations and the Court \r\nby means of practical steps, such as those contained in \r\nthe report of the Court to the Assembly of States Parties \r\non the status of ongoing cooperation between the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and the United Nations, is \r\na prospect that we support.\r\nIt is a fact that the Court continues to look to the \r\ninternational community for support and cooperation \r\nin establishing accountability for the most serious \r\ncrimes under international law, bringing justice to \r\nvictims and affected communities, and helping to \r\nprevent future atrocities. In this context, my delegation \r\nwould like to seize the opportunity of this meeting to \r\nreiterate its commitment and support to the Court, a \r\nsupport that we have afforded to the Court since its \r\ninception. In line with Cyprus’s role as a focal point \r\nwithin the Assembly of States Parties for the promotion \r\nof universality and the full implementation of the Rome \r\nStatute, I would like to welcome the accession of the \r\nState of Palestine to the Rome Statute and to seize this \r\nopportunity to call upon States not parties to ratify \r\nthe Rome Statute, preferably in its 2010 version. The \r\nuniversal ratification of the Rome Statute is crucial to \r\nthe application of the principle of equality before the \r\nlaw and to the effective deterrence of the most serious \r\ncrimes under international law. We also look forward \r\nto an early activation of the provisions on the crime of \r\n15-35224 27/27\r\n05/11/2015 A/70/PV.48\r\naggression and encourage States parties that have not \r\nyet done so to ratify the Kampala amendments.\r\nIt is always worthwhile to remind ourselves and the \r\ninternational community that the very creation of the \r\nICC was thought by many to be a mission impossible. \r\nYet, for the last 13 years, the Court has been making \r\na perceptible contribution to the advancement of \r\ninternational justice. For this reason, the Republic of \r\nCyprus would, in welcoming this year’s report of the \r\nICC, like to reiterate its unwavering support to the \r\nCourt. It is our conviction that, through universality, \r\ncooperation and complementarity, the current and \r\nfuture challenges of the Court can be overcome. States \r\nparties, especially, ought to continue promoting the \r\nindependence, credibility and efficiency of the Court. \r\nWe very much welcome the example of complementarity \r\nwith regard to the preliminary examination in Guinea \r\nmentioned in the report and share the hope that it will \r\nserve as a successful cooperation model for other \r\nsituations.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item for this meeting.\r\nThe representative of the Sudan has requested to \r\nspeak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind \r\nmembers that statements in the exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand to five minutes for the second statement and should \r\nbe made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Saeed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\ndelegation of the Sudan would like to take the f loor \r\nto respond to the representative of Slovenia, who had \r\nthe audacity to make an undiplomatic reference to \r\nthe Sudan and the President of our Republic in his \r\nstatement, even though we all here work in the area of \r\ndiplomacy. In his statement, he named the President of \r\nour Republic without giving him his title, even while \r\nknowing that he is the President of a State Member of \r\nthe United Nations. The Sudan was the first State in the \r\nsub-Saharan region to achieve independence, some 60 \r\nyears ago.\r\nThe case of the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\ninvolving the Sudan is political in the extreme and has \r\nnothing to do with justice. It is an example of selectivity, \r\npoliticization and double standards. It is also an attempt \r\nto undermine the stability and development of the \r\nSudan, as well as its territorial security and integrity \r\nand its political independence. All this is surely quite \r\nclear to the representative of Slovenia, who must be \r\naware of these principles and this reality.\r\nThe reference by the representative of Slovenia \r\nis unacceptable, inappropriate and not in line with \r\ndiplomatic custom. It echoes well-known positions \r\nagainst the Sudan, its people and its leadership, including \r\nthe symbol of the Sudan, which is the President of the \r\nRepublic. The fact that the representative of Slovenia \r\nhighlighted this matter makes the State of Slovenia a tool \r\nused by the International Criminal Court to echo well-\r\nknown positions. That is strange and unacceptable. The \r\ndelegation of the Sudan expresses its strong rejection of \r\nthe reference by the representative of Slovenia.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
