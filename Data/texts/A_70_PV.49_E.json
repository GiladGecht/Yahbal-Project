In Nuremburg it was \r\ndecided that:\r\n“[c]rimes against international law are committed \r\nby men, not by abstract entities, and only by \r\npunishing individuals who commit such crimes can \r\nthe provision of international law be enforced”.\r\nSeventy years ago in San Francisco, our founding \r\nfathers and mothers adopted a text that created this \r\nvery Organization. Their prayer remains as relevant \r\nas it is eloquent — to save us and those after us from \r\nthe scourge of war which twice in their lifetime \r\nbrought untold sorrow to all humankind. Arguably, \r\nthe United Nations is the best thing that happened \r\nto the rule of law and international law. Among its \r\nmany achievements, the United Nations, through the \r\nInternational Law Commission and the initiative of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago in 1989, recognized the growing \r\nclamour for a permanent international criminal court. \r\nThe long campaign culminated in the United Nations \r\nDiplomatic Conference leading to the adoption of the \r\nRome Statute in 1998, its entry into force in 2002, and \r\nthe election of the first bench of judges in 2003.\r\nToday the Philippines reaffirms its commitment to \r\nfighting impunity and ensuring that perpetrators are \r\nheld to account for their crimes. For if we cannot deliver \r\ninternational criminal justice, global peace and security \r\nwill not be possible. The International Criminal Court \r\nhas become central to the majesty of the rule of law in \r\nour time. Just as Nuremburg pointed to individuals as \r\nauthors of untold sorrow and injustice to multitudes, so \r\nmust we recognize individuals who contribute to the \r\ncollective work of delivering international justice — a \r\nvocation that is certainly difficult, sometimes thankless \r\nand possibly dangerous. They include members of the \r\nSecretariat across the United Nations family involved \r\nin the delivery of justice; the judges of the Court led \r\nby President Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi; Prosecutor \r\nFatou Bensouda; the staff of both the Court and the \r\nProsecutor; President Sidiki Kaba of the Assembly \r\nof States Parties and his team; and the lawyers, civil \r\nsociety advocates, witnesses and victims, many of \r\nwhom are unnamed and unsung. Indeed, it is people, \r\nindividually then collectively, who make justice work.\r\nThe Philippines pays close attention to the \r\nincreasingly heavy workload of the Court — its pending \r\njudicial proceedings, situations, and preliminary \r\nexaminations. Developments in the work of the Court \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.49\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n49th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 6 November 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nand of the Prosecutor concern us as a State party. \r\nConsistent with the principle of complementarity \r\nand as part of our duty of cooperation, we strive to \r\nensure that our criminal justice system is transparent, \r\nfair, effective and relatively speedy, allowing for \r\nthe prosecution of crimes under the Rome Statute. \r\nThe Philippine legislation enacted in 2009 on crimes \r\nagainst international humanitarian law, genocide, and \r\nother crimes against humanity paved the way for our \r\nratification of the Rome Statute.\r\nThe Philippines supports the code of conduct \r\nregarding Security Council action against genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity or war crimes, elaborated \r\nin the context of the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group under the leadership of \r\nLiechtenstein. The five permanent members should \r\nrefrain from using their veto in situations involving \r\nmass atrocity crimes under the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt. We also call on the Security Council to take \r\nthe necessary follow-up measures on situations it has \r\nreferred to the Court so as to uphold the credibility of \r\nboth institutions and to ensure accountability.\r\nThe Philippines also supports the mainstreaming \r\nof the work of the Court in the United Nations system, \r\nincluding in the work of UN-Women, as a follow-up \r\nto Security Council resolution 1325 (2000) on women, \r\npeace and security. States, whether parties or not, \r\nshould help each other to protect human rights and build \r\ndomestic capacities, including through human-resource \r\ndevelopment-related assistance such as the training of \r\njudges, prosecutors, the police and the military. The \r\nPhilippines would like to take this opportunity to thank, \r\nonce again, the States parties for their confidence in the \r\nabilities of Professor Raul Pangalangan to contribute to \r\nthe work of the Court, and for electing him as a judge \r\nfor the next six years.\r\nOur goal is universality. We join the call for many \r\nmore countries to ratify or accede to the Rome Statute, \r\nparticularly from our Asia-Pacific region. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \r\nnow defines our global development framework. We \r\nwill achieve that agenda only if we have peace and \r\nsecurity based on justice for our generation and for \r\ngenerations yet to come.\r\nMr. Remaoun (Algeria) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, I should like to join previous speakers in thanking \r\nthe President of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nJudge Silvia Alejandra Fernández de Gurmendi, for her \r\nvery detailed briefing (see A/70/PV.48) on the activities \r\nof the International Criminal Court covering the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015, in accordance with \r\narticle 6 of the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the International Criminal Court. I \r\nshould also like to take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nher on her election to this important post.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI should like also to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis two reports, the first entitled “Information relevant \r\nto the implementation of article 3 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the \r\nInternational Criminal Court” (A/70/317). The second \r\nis entitled “Expenses incurred and reimbursement \r\nreceived by the United Nations in connection with \r\nassistance provided to the International Criminal \r\nCourt” (A/70/346).\r\nAlgeria welcomes this opportunity to contribute to \r\nthe discussions on this crucial agenda item and wants \r\nto echo the concerns raised in past years by the African \r\nUnion, African States and many other countries \r\nthroughout the world with regard to the need for the \r\nSecurity Council, the ICC and the Assembly of States \r\nParties to engage constructively with the requests \r\nsubmitted by both the African Union and African \r\nStates.\r\nHere in the General Assembly, we reiterate our \r\nunflinching commitment to fighting impunity and \r\ngranting access to justice. My country has shown \r\nover the years its determination to uphold the rule of \r\nlaw and promote human rights, democracy and good \r\ngovernance. We understand, on the one hand, that there \r\nis a need for the international community to commit \r\nto fighting impunity and ensuring the prosecution of \r\nindividuals suspected of having committed crimes of \r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. \r\nOn the other hand, we have to stress the primary role \r\nof sovereign States in pursuing such objectives. We \r\nrecall in this respect that this primacy derives from \r\nmany principles well established under international \r\ncustomary law, international law and national laws, \r\nsuch as the principle of State sovereignty, territorial \r\njurisdiction, nationality, the primacy of actions by \r\nStates regarding criminal prosecutions, the protective \r\nprinciple, and the immunity of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment in the exercise of their functions.\r\nThe primacy of national jurisdictions granted \r\nby the Rome Statute itself under the principle of \r\ncomplementarity has not been duly applied in some \r\n15-35401 3/18\r\n06/11/2015 A/70/PV.49\r\ncases that were referred to the Court by the Security \r\nCouncil or the Office of the Prosecutor. In this regard \r\nwe cannot be astonished to see many States, even \r\nthose that are parties to the Statute, questioning the \r\nimpartiality of this institution and the criteria that \r\nhave been used in taking the decision whether or not \r\nto refer the Court, and expressin fears and doubts about \r\npolitical manipulation and selectivity.\r\nIt is of the utmost importance to recall that the \r\npoliticization, selectivity and misuse of indictments and \r\nabuse by the International Criminal Court, targeting \r\nonly African States and leaders, were the main reasons \r\nfor convening the extraordinary Summit of the African \r\nUnion in Addis Ababa in October 2013. As noted by \r\nour Heads of State and Government at the Summit, the \r\nactivities of the International Criminal Court since its \r\nestablishment have focused exclusively on Africa, while \r\nunacceptable situations in other parts of the world have \r\nbeen ignored.\r\nThe issue of international justice must include \r\nthe need to respect the sovereignty and national \r\nindependence of all States, including African countries. \r\nIn this regard, based on national law and international \r\ncustomary law, which grants immunity to sitting Heads \r\nof State and Government and other senior State officials \r\nduring their tenure, the African Union (AU) Summit \r\ndecided\r\n“to safeguard the constitutional order, stability and \r\nintegrity of Member States, no charges shall be \r\ncommenced or continued before any International \r\nCourt or Tribunal against any serving AU Head of \r\nState or Government or anybody acting or entitled \r\nto act in such capacity during their term of office”.\r\nWhile Algeria welcomes the decision made by \r\nthe Prosecutor of the ICC on 5 December 2014 to \r\nwithdraw the charges against the President of Kenya, \r\nmy delegation would like to echo the other important \r\nconclusions of the latest Summit of the African \r\nUnion, held last June in South Africa, which mainly \r\nrequested suspending proceedings initiated against \r\na serving African President or Deputy President, in \r\naccordance with article 16 of the Rome Statute on the \r\ndeferral of cases, until the African Union’s concerns \r\nand proposals for amendments to the Rome Statute are \r\nconsidered. Those legally sound proposals represent a \r\nreal opportunity to reinforce the conviction of Member \r\nStates of the impartiality of international justice; \r\ndefuse polarization; and preserve and safeguard peace, \r\nsecurity and the stability of our African continent, as \r\nwell as its dignity, sovereignty and integrity.\r\nMr. Andrianarivelo-Razafy (Madagascar) (spoke \r\nin French): The delegation of Madagascar would like to \r\nthank Judge Fernández de Gurmendi, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), for introducing the \r\nreport of that international body (see A/70/PV.48).\r\nDuring the period covered by the report (A/70/35), \r\nthe United Nations celebrated the tenth anniversary \r\nof the entry into force of the Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International \r\nCriminal Court, the only standing criminal court with \r\nuniversal jurisdiction. According to its reports, we \r\nnote that the implementation of the Agreement has \r\nstrengthened the links between the United Nations \r\nand the Court. We express our heartfelt gratitude to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his commitment \r\nand devotion in the service of the United Nations \r\nand the Court. Madagascar fully supports the Court’s \r\nactivities.\r\nCooperation is of vital importance to the \r\nfunctioning of the Court. Strengthening the regime of \r\ninternational cooperation and cooperation between the \r\nStates and the ICC is of key importance to the future of \r\nthe Court and to allow it to achieve its full potential. In \r\nthis regard, my delegation welcomes the convening in \r\nGaborone, on 29 and 30 October, of a high-level seminar \r\non cooperation between the ICC and the States and the \r\nlink between that cooperation and the strengthening of \r\nregional and national capacities, in which my country, \r\nMadagascar participated alongside other countries of \r\nthe Southern African Development Community.\r\nThe seminar helped us to strengthen the \r\nfundamental role of cooperation of States parties as an \r\noperational pillar of the Court. The effectiveness of the \r\nCourt depends on such cooperation. It is now time to \r\nimplement the 66 cooperation recommendations that \r\nwere adopted in 2007 by the Assembly of States Parties. \r\nWe thank the organizers of that event — in particular the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, in cooperation with the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Botswana — which was \r\nsponsored by the European Union and the Governments \r\nof the Kingdom of the Netherlands and Norway.\r\nGrowing threats to peace and international \r\nsecurity, the current scope of migratory f lows, and \r\nongoing violence and atrocities remain a major source \r\nof concern to the international community, which is \r\ndetermined to put an end to impunity and to persecute \r\n4/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nthe perpetrators of the crimes of genocide, war crimes \r\nand crimes against humanity. That is why we supported \r\nthe initiative of France and Mexico to suspend the veto in \r\ncases of mass atrocities, and the initiatives put forward \r\nby Liechtenstein and the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency group on a code of conduct to govern \r\nSecurity Council action against genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes. A declaration on this \r\nmatter was adopted in the framework of the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations.\r\nThe adoption of the Kampala amendments on the \r\ncrime of aggression in June 2010 was a significant \r\nadvance in terms of making international criminal law \r\nmore effective. The declaration adopted in September \r\n2012 at the high-level meeting on the rule of law at \r\nthe national and international levels underscores the \r\ninternational community’s awareness of the role that the \r\nICC plays in a multilateral system aimed at putting an \r\nend to impunity and ensuring the rule of law. It stresses \r\nthat impunity for crimes of genocide, war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity will not be tolerated.\r\nIn this context, Madagascar is committed to \r\nratifying the Kampala amendments on the crime of \r\naggression, as reaffirmed by the President of our \r\nNational Assembly during his visit to New York in \r\nSeptember to participate in the parliamentary meetings \r\non the roles of parliamentarians in criminalizing illegal \r\nand aggressive acts of war. A national action has been \r\nadopted to implement the Rome Statute and to integrate \r\nsome of its provisions into our national legislative \r\nframework.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of the President of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties, Mr. Sidiki Kaba of Senegal, \r\nto overcome the challenges before the Court and to \r\nmake it stronger and more independent. My delegation \r\ntakes this opportunity to congratulate and wish every \r\nsuccess to the new judges who took up their posts on \r\n11 March and 11 July. We also congratulate the State \r\nof Palestine, which became the 123rd State party to the \r\nRome Statute, and the States that have ratified and \r\naccepted the amendments to the statute on the crime \r\nof aggression. We encourage those States that are not \r\nparties to the Rome Statute to accede to it.\r\nMr. Xu Hong (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation congratulates Judge Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi on her election as the President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC) and thanks \r\nher for her report (A/70/350).\r\nChina has always attached importance to the \r\nsignificant role of the ICC in maintaining international \r\npeace, security and justice, prosecuting serious \r\ninternational crimes, and promoting the development of \r\ninternational law, and has participated as an observer \r\nState in successive sessions of the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute.\r\nThe ICC and the United Nations are independent \r\nyet related organizations with the common interest of \r\npreventing and punishing serious international crimes \r\nthat endanger international peace and security. The work \r\nof the two can therefore be mutually reinforcing. The \r\nICC and the United Nations, and the Security Council \r\nin particular, should respect each other’s functions; \r\nintensify cooperation within the legal framework \r\ndefined by the Charter of the United Nations, relevant \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, and the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the International Criminal Court; \r\nand build a constructive partnership.\r\nThe recent work of the ICC has demonstrated that \r\nprosecutors are becoming more cautious and pragmatic \r\nin their investigations and prosecutions, and the role of \r\nthe Court in international affairs is enjoying increasing \r\nattention. China hopes the Court will continue to \r\nperform its duties prudently in order to ensure that \r\ncriminal justice is not achieved at the expense of peace, \r\nstability and national reconciliation. In addressing the \r\nissue of the immunity of Heads of State, we hope that \r\nthe Court will strictly abide by existing international \r\nlaw and take into full consideration the legal claims \r\nof certain countries so as to avoid obstructing the \r\nperformance by State leaders of their duties.\r\nThe Chinese delegation notes that 24 State parties \r\nhave ratified the amendment to the Rome Statute \r\non the crime of aggression. Given that the crime of \r\naggression has a bearing on international peace and \r\nsecurity, the amendment should be implemented in an \r\norderly manner within the framework of international \r\nlaw established by the United Nations Charter. The \r\nparamount authority of the Charter must be safeguarded, \r\nand any other international legislation must conform to \r\nits provisions. Regarding the content of the amendment \r\nand the timing of its entry into force, China believes \r\nthat parties should engage in full consultations to seek \r\nmaximum consensus with a view to reaching the widest \r\npossible agreement.\r\nPeace, justice and the rule of law are the shared \r\nvision and aspiration of human society. China looks \r\n15-35401 5/18\r\n06/11/2015 A/70/PV.49\r\nforward to ongoing contributions by the Court to that \r\nlofty goal.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We welcome \r\nPresident Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, the first \r\nwoman to head the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nas President. We commend her for her strong leadership \r\nand look forward to seeing her frequently here in New \r\nYork.\r\nThe Court’s report shows the progress made during \r\nthe past year. The opening of the trial against Bosco \r\nNtaganda stands out in particular, along with the fact \r\nthat the Court will finally be able to provide justice \r\nfor the victims of the Lord’s Resistance Army. The \r\nupcoming year will mark the highest level yet of judicial \r\nactivities. That illustrates how dynamic and active the \r\ninstitution has become and that there is a solid level of \r\ncooperation from States.\r\nExpediting judicial proceedings while guaranteeing \r\nfull respect for the rights of the accused remains a \r\nchallenge and is key for the future success of the ICC, \r\nbut we should not assume that enhancing efficiency \r\nand making budget cuts automatically go hand in \r\nhand. A lack of funding can be a factor in slowing \r\ndown proceedings, at which point financial austerity \r\nbecomes counterproductive. Demands on the ground, \r\nnot financial considerations, should determine the \r\nscope of the Court’s activities.\r\nJustice is inexpensive compared to the human and \r\nfinancial costs associated with atrocity crimes, from \r\nmassive material destruction to large-scale displacement. \r\nWe are therefore concerned by the comments made \r\nyesterday by the Prosecutor in the Security Council \r\n(see S/PV.7549) that a new investigation in Libya may \r\nnot be possible due to lack of funding, and in spite of \r\nthe obvious potential benefits of such an investigation. \r\nThis also reinforces the point that States parties have \r\nbeen making for a number of years now that the costs \r\nfor investigations resulting from a Security Council \r\nreferral should be financed from the United Nations \r\nbudget, as provided for under the Rome Statute.\r\nThe Council’s lack of follow-up to its referrals \r\ncontinues to hamper accountability, in particular its \r\nlack of response to notifications of non-cooperation. \r\nThe failure of the Council to do its job under the Rome \r\nStatute makes the full application of the other provisions \r\nimpossible. Ten years after its first referral, the Council \r\nstill lacks direction and purpose in its relationship with \r\nthe Court. There is much room for a more productive \r\nrelationship, including through stronger mandates \r\nfor peacekeeping and special political missions and \r\ntargeted sanctions against indicted persons.\r\nUnfortunately, the report of the High-level \r\nIndependent Panel on Peace Operations (see A/70/95) \r\nfails to address this point even though 44 States have \r\nissued a joint submission calling for better support of \r\nthe ICC and its mandate by peace operations. We hope \r\nthat this can be remedied in the review by States that \r\nis under way. It is not only the Council that has to step \r\nup its game. States parties themselves must increase \r\ntheir efforts to execute more than a dozen outstanding \r\narrest warrants. The location of many indictees is \r\npublic knowledge. Full cooperation with the Court is \r\nan obligation that States have voluntarily undertaken in \r\nratifying the Rome Statute.\r\nThe prosecution and the defence also rely on \r\ncooperation for investigations and witness protection \r\nand in order to ensure the freezing of assets of indictees. \r\nWe have just organized a workshop in The Hague on \r\nfinancial investigations, together with the Court and \r\nthe Basel Institute on Governance. We hope that its \r\nfindings can be the basis for concrete progress in this \r\narea of cooperation between States and the Court.\r\nThe universality of the Rome Statute remains a \r\nkey goal. While 123 States parties is a solid number, \r\nthe Court does not currently have jurisdiction in more \r\nthan one third of the United Nations membership. \r\nThe Informal Ministerial Network coordinated by \r\nour Foreign Minister has initiated an action plan for \r\nuniversality in order to move forward and to close the \r\nexisting impunity gaps. Expanding membership in the \r\nCourt is the most obvious way to fight the perception \r\nof selectivity from which the Court continues to suffer.\r\nWe welcome the progress made in the ratification \r\nprocess of the Kampala amendments on the crime of \r\naggression, which many speakers before me have \r\nreferenced in their interventions. With the ratification \r\nof Switzerland in September, only six additional \r\nratifications are needed to allow for the activation of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction in 2017. The Kampala amendments \r\non the crime of aggression are firmly based on existing \r\ninternational law, provide for full clarity on their \r\napplication in practice, and were therefore adopted by \r\nconsensus by all States parties at the Review Conference \r\nin 2010.\r\nThe Kampala agreement exempts non-States \r\nparties from the jurisdiction of the Court, and it fully \r\n6/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nsafeguards the Court’s independence vis-à-vis the \r\nSecurity Council while fully respecting the provisions of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The activation of the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction in 2017 will make the most serious \r\nforms of the illegal use of force a punishable offence \r\nbefore the ICC. This will complement the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, which prohibits the illegal use of \r\nforce and brings to a conclusion almost two decades of \r\ndiscussion in the framework of the Rome Statute.\r\nWhenever atrocity crimes occur, there are calls \r\nfor the ICC to get involved. The institution is thus \r\nconfronted with the highest expectations, while it can \r\nof course not bring justice of itself. Its value, however, \r\nis not limited to cases where it has the capacity to \r\nconduct trials. It has been scientifically proven that \r\nthe International Criminal Court can deter crimes. A \r\nrecent academic study illustrated that some potential \r\nperpetrators have shied away from enlisting child \r\nsoldiers because of the fear of ICC prosecution.\r\nThe biggest benefit of the Court’s work, however, \r\nis its central role as a symbol of accountability and an \r\nincentive for States to investigate and prosecute the \r\nmost serious crimes in their national systems. There is \r\nmuch room for international involvement in building \r\nand strengthening national capacities in this respect. \r\nWe hope that we can enhance cooperation among the \r\nCourt, the United Nations system and all States in order \r\nto be better equipped to fight impunity.\r\nMr. Barro (Senegal) (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof my delegation, I should like first to congratulate you \r\nvery warmly, Mr. President, on your election to preside \r\nover this seventieth session of the General Assembly. I \r\nreiterate the support of my delegation as you carry out \r\nyour work.\r\nI should also like to congratulate Ms. Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi on her election as President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC). I welcome \r\nthe laudable efforts that she has been making at the \r\nhead of that body in her relationship with the judges, \r\nthe Prosecutor’s Office and the Registry in order to \r\npromote international justice.\r\nPlease allow me, in the same vein, to reiterate the \r\nsincere gratitude of my country to the States parties \r\nthat placed their trust in Mr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister \r\nof Justice of Senegal, as President of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the opportunity to \r\nconsider the report of the International Criminal Court \r\n(A/70/350) and commends its relevance in providing \r\nus with essential information on the activities of the \r\nCourt from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015, in particular \r\nthe preliminary examinations, investigations and trials, \r\nas well as the support extended to the Court by the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular through its offices and \r\npeacekeeping missions throughout the world.\r\nI believe that dynamic interaction among the \r\nCourt, the General Assembly and the Security Council \r\ncan contribute to strengthening international peace \r\nand security and to suppressing serious crimes against \r\nhumanity. Working in perfect harmony, these three \r\nbodies, whose complementarity is obvious, could \r\nfurther contribute to ensuring international peace and \r\nsecurity because they often face the same challenges. \r\nIn this regard, my delegation supports the idea of \r\nextending an annual invitation to the President and \r\nthe Prosecutor of the Court to inform the Council and \r\nexchange views on issues of common interest and ways \r\nto strengthen their mutual cooperation. We are also \r\nin favour of allowing the Office of Legal Affairs, the \r\nfocal point of cooperation between the Court and the \r\nUnited Nations system, to assume a stronger role as \r\ncoordinator among the various United Nations bodies.\r\nFrom 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015, the Court \r\nhad a very heavy workload. During that period, the \r\nProsecutor’s Office had to carry out preliminary \r\nexaminations of 10 situations and open a new \r\ninvestigation on the situation in another country. The \r\ngrowing number of cases before the Court is an indicator \r\nof its importance and of the hopes that it inspires that \r\nimpunity for the crimes under its jurisdiction, which \r\nweigh heavy on our collective conscience, may be \r\neliminated. But the ongoing increase in the number of \r\ncases before the Court, together with the insufficiency \r\nof available resources, could have a negative impact on \r\nits effectiveness. It is therefore necessary to strengthen \r\nthe financial support of the United Nations in order to \r\nenable the Court to carry out its functions.\r\nIn this regard, the General Assembly should \r\ntake into account the costs of various investigations \r\nand prosecutions linked to situations that have been \r\nreferred to the Court under article 115 (b) of the Rome \r\nStatute, which states that funds shall be provided by the \r\nUnited Nations, subject to the approval of the General \r\nAssembly, in particular in relation to the expenses \r\nincurred due to referrals by the Security Council.\r\nFurthermore, it is also important to keep in mind \r\nthe subsidiary jurisdiction of the Court, which can \r\n15-35401 7/18\r\n06/11/2015 A/70/PV.49\r\nbe seized of cases only when a State cannot or will \r\nnot discharge its responsibility to prosecute crimes \r\nthat are punishable under the Rome Statute. In that \r\nregard, the United Nations should continue to provide \r\ntechnical assistance to those countries that request it, in \r\nparticular to strengthen their national capacities in the \r\ninstitutional and legislative spheres by training their \r\njudicial personnel and police and security forces.\r\nHaving established the International Criminal \r\nCourt and made it a standing body, the international \r\ncommunity must now rise to the challenge of achieving \r\nits universality by encouraging States that have not yet \r\ndone so to sign or ratify the Rome Statute. In this regard, \r\nI should like to congratulate the State of Palestine on its \r\nrecent accession to the Rome Statute.\r\nThe cooperation of States parties and non-parties, \r\ncivil society and subregional and regional organizations \r\nwith the Court is also of key importance to its functions, \r\nin particular with respect to proceedings, investigations, \r\nthe handling of evidence and the implementation of \r\ninternational mandates. I encourage States to ratify the \r\nagreement on the privileges and immunities of Court \r\npersonnel, as Senegal did in September 2014 during the \r\ntreaty ceremony. Furthermore, the Security Council, \r\nas guarantor of international peace and security, must \r\nact responsibly and objectively when it considers \r\nsituations of mass atrocities. The Council’s support and \r\ncooperation are therefore indispensable to ensure that \r\nthe Court functions well.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wholeheartedly calls \r\nfor strengthened cooperation between the United \r\nNations system and the Court on a broad spectrum of \r\ntopics. In that spirit, the full and complete cooperation \r\nof the international community is obviously necessary \r\nto ensure that the perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes under international law are held accountable for \r\ntheir activities, that we deliver justice to the victims and \r\ncommunities that were affected, and that we prevent \r\nfurther atrocities.\r\nMr. Sarki (Nigeria): We wish to thank the President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, for her comprehensive report \r\n(A/70/350) and to congratulate her and the seven new \r\njudges who were elected to serve in the Court during \r\nthe reporting period. We wish to seize this opportunity \r\nalso to express appreciation to the President of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nICC, Mr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister of Justice of Senegal, \r\nfor his work in coordinating the affairs of the Assembly \r\nsince he assumed office on 8 December 2014. We also \r\nwish to congratulate the State of Palestine on acceding \r\nto the Rome Statute.\r\nWe note that the ICC has made appreciable progress \r\nin the fight against impunity and crimes against \r\nhumanity. We commend the Court for its contribution to \r\nthe development of substantive and procedural elements \r\nof international criminal law. The contributions of the \r\nCourt to the promotion of the rule of law and respect for \r\nhuman rights are also very commendable. Through its \r\nwork, the need to ensure accountability for genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes has been \r\nstrengthened.\r\nThe raison d’être of the ICC is based on the concept \r\nthat impunity must be challenged and that everybody \r\nshould be held accountable for their actions. Therefore, \r\nthe cooperation of States, international organizations \r\nand civil society is vital for the Court to continue \r\ndischarging its role as enshrined in the Rome Statute. \r\nIt is for this reason that Nigeria finds it perplexing that \r\nsome Member States have decided not to recognize the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction over their nationals, while at the \r\nsame time clamouring for the imposition of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction over the nationals of other States, including \r\nHeads of State and Government.\r\nThat said, we note that during the reporting period, \r\nthe ICC had a busy schedule in which the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor conducted preliminary examination \r\nactivities in 10 situations and opened a new investigation \r\ninto the situation in the Central African Republic. \r\nAlso, the Court admitted 4,002 victims to participate \r\nin proceedings before it. It is also envisaged that there \r\nwill be an unprecedented number of four trials that will \r\ntake place simultaneously in 2016, which would cover \r\nalleged crimes involving more than 10,000 victims.\r\nWe wish to recognize the work done by the Court \r\non specific country situations. We commend the Libyan \r\nrepresentatives to the ICC for their close cooperation \r\nwith the Office of the Prosecutor. We welcome the \r\nexchange of information between the Libyan Prosecutor-\r\nGeneral’s Office and the Office of the ICC Prosecutor \r\nand commend the commitment and professionalism of \r\nthe Libyan national investigators. We encourage the \r\ntwo sides to strengthen their cooperation and work \r\ntogether to end impunity in Libya.\r\nWe condemn all mass executions, including that of \r\na group of 30 Ethiopian Christians by the Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Sham (ISIS). We also condemn other \r\n8/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nabductions that have been attributed to ISIS. We call for \r\nan immediate and unconditional ceasefire across Libya. \r\nParties involved in the conflict should refrain from \r\ntargeting civilians or civilian targets and should desist \r\nfrom committing further criminal acts. We call on all \r\nLibyan militias to disarm and participate in the efforts \r\nto restore peace, and law and order in the country. We \r\nsupport the political dialogue and the formation of a \r\nGovernment of national accord to meet the aspirations \r\nof the Libyan people to establish the rule of law in their \r\ncountry and to end the conflict and safeguard Libya’s \r\nunity and territorial integrity. That is vital to stabilizing \r\nthe country and ending the impunity of terrorist groups \r\nand militias.\r\nWe also welcome improved cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC, cooperation between \r\nthe ICC and United Nations peacekeeping missions and \r\nother United Nations presences in the field, as well as \r\ncooperation with the Security Council. We agree with \r\nthe report that, as the main forum for international \r\ncooperation and consultation, the United Nations offers \r\na unique context for promoting the mainstreaming and \r\nunderstanding of Rome Statute issues and considerations \r\ninto a wider variety of areas of international activity. \r\nWe also note with satisfaction the content of the report \r\nconcerning cooperation with and assistance from States, \r\nother international organizations and civil society, as \r\nwell as the cooperation between relevant partners in \r\nthe context of supporting and strengthening the Rome \r\nStatute system of international criminal justice, which \r\nis an example of complementarity in action.\r\nThe report also indicates that the Office of the \r\nProsecutor continues its analysis of the war crimes \r\ncommitted by Boko Haram and allegedly also by the \r\nNigerian security forces in the context of the fight \r\nagainst terrorism in Nigeria. It is noteworthy that the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor has not been able to identify \r\nany case against the Nigerian security forces. It must \r\nbe noted clearly that as a signatory to the Rome Statute, \r\nNigeria is faithfully committed to the ideals of the \r\nresponsibility to protect. The protection of civilians in \r\narmed conflict, especially women, girls and children \r\nand other vulnerable persons, is a commitment that we \r\nhave taken upon ourselves. Our stance on human rights, \r\nthe rule of law, peace and security, democracy and good \r\ngovernance and accountability are also in line with the \r\nfounding principles of the ICC.\r\nWe have been demonstrating our abiding commitment \r\nto the promotion of these values in diverse ways. \r\nNigeria is a member of the Assembly of States Parties \r\nto the Rome Statute of the ICC, which we ratified on \r\n27 September 2001. We have consistently underlined \r\nthe structural importance of the ICC in the fight against \r\nimpunity and in the quest for judicial accountability. \r\nWe believe that impunity must be addressed resolutely \r\nwherever it occurs in the world and not just selectively \r\nby targeting weaker States. It is our belief that the \r\naspiration for a global system that is based on the rule \r\nof law, where accountability and social justice are the \r\nfoundations for durable peace, should be a source of \r\ninspiration to all. Indeed, that should be a priority for \r\nthe international community.\r\nMr. Misztal (Poland): Poland aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the observer of the European Union \r\non this agenda item (see A/70/PV.48). My delegation \r\nwould nevertheless like to underline and discuss some \r\nof the points it considers to be of the utmost importance.\r\nFirst, let me take this opportunity to thank the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for its annual \r\nreport to the United Nations (see A/70/350). I also wish \r\nto congratulate the new President of the Court, Judge \r\nSilvia Fernández de Gurmendi, and all newly elected \r\njudges. We are proud that Judge Piotr Hofmański, who \r\nwas nominated by my Government, is one of them. \r\nI am sure that their work will contribute to further \r\nstrengthening the international system of justice.\r\nThe caseload of the Court has continued to increase \r\nduring the reporting period. Especially significant is \r\nthe Court’s first appeals judgment on the merits in \r\nthe Thomas Lubanga case. We welcome the ongoing \r\nefforts aimed at improving the Court’s work. We \r\nbelieve that introducing some changes to the rules \r\nof procedure and evidence involving, among others, \r\nlimiting the composition of the Court in certain cases, \r\nwould contribute to more efficient proceedings without \r\nprejudice to their reliability and integrity.\r\nWe are a long way from achieving the Rome \r\nStatute’s universality. The majority of humankind still \r\nlives in States that are not party to the Rome Statute, \r\nthe treaty which, by envisaging effective punishment of \r\nperpetrators, aims at the protection of individuals from \r\nmost grievous crimes. That is why we believe that the \r\nidea of universality should be advocated by any means \r\npossible. We welcome the ICC’s efforts to stimulate \r\ninterest and support for more countries to consider \r\njoining the Court. But it is also a responsibility of each \r\nState Party to spread the values of the Rome Statute. \r\nWe welcome the Action Plan for the Universality of \r\n15-35401 9/18\r\n06/11/2015 A/70/PV.49\r\nthe Rome Statute, adopted recently by the Informal \r\nMinisterial Network for the ICC, in which my country \r\nplays an active part. It is a perfect example of the \r\npolitical support States parties can provide in order to \r\nchampion the idea of universality.\r\nYet, there is still much to be done in this area and \r\nin the field of promoting understanding of the Statute’s \r\nsignificance among the parties themselves. The \r\nyear 2015 is the first in a long time when, instead of \r\nlooking in hope at the growing number of Rome Statute \r\nStates parties, we might worry that they may begin \r\nto dwindle. It is a great challenge for the ICC and the \r\nStates parties to overcome this state of affairs. In this \r\ncontext, cooperation with African partners is especially \r\nimportant. Poland emphasizes that it is indispensable \r\nfor African countries to be part of the international \r\nsystem of justice underpinned by the Rome Statute. \r\nEach State party from Africa is priceless if the scales \r\nof justice are to operate fairly.\r\nPoland underlines that victims should be at the \r\ncentre of attention of the ICC’s legal system. Their rights, \r\nespecially the rights to participation and reparation, \r\nare a fundamental aspect of the Rome Statute. Poland \r\ncontributes to the Trust Fund for Victims and invites \r\nother parties to do so. The Trust Fund supports victims \r\nof crimes under the ICC’s jurisdiction and enables them \r\nto pursue their rights. It is worth noting that during \r\nthe reporting period the Court and the Trust Fund for \r\nVictims started to implement the first court-ordered \r\nreparations in the Thomas Lubanga case. Never before \r\nhas this innovative solution established in article 75 of \r\nthe Rome Statute been applied. We expect that further \r\ncontributions to the Fund will enable victims to exercise \r\ntheir right to reparation.\r\nSpecial attention should also be devoted to instances \r\nof the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter and referring a situation to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. Poland strongly believes \r\nthat the Council should enforce cooperation on the part \r\nof the States concerned should they fail to cooperate in \r\nfulfilling the Court’s mandate.\r\nMr. González Franco (Paraguay), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nThe present global situation proves that the number \r\nof armed conflicts is far from falling. New challenges \r\nare piling up for the international system of justice. \r\nIt must therefore be remembered that even the most \r\nsmoothly running institution will not be efficient \r\nwithout collaborative effort and good will on the part \r\nof members of the international community. That \r\napplies to parties to the Rome Statute and non-States \r\nparties alike, as well as to all permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council, as everyone should care about \r\nputting an end to impunity for the worst atrocities. \r\nThere cannot be lasting peace without justice, and \r\nensuring justice is our common responsibility.\r\nWe believe that only together can we free the world \r\nfrom all forms of injustice. Poland supports the ICC \r\nin its struggle against impunity, as it is the central \r\ninstitution of the international systems of justice. It is \r\ntherefore necessary to make progress towards achieving \r\na more efficient and effective Court and to protect its \r\nindependence. Full and unconditional independence of \r\nthe ICC is a sine qua non of the international criminal \r\njustice system. We have always supported the Court’s \r\nmission and will continue to do so.\r\nMr. Kamau (Kenya): We thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/70/350) on the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). I should also like at this point \r\nto take the opportunity to recognize Judge Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi, President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Judge Fernández takes over the leadership of the \r\nCourt at a time when the Court is growing in stature \r\nand reach. I wish to reassure the Judge, on behalf of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya, of our continued support.\r\nOver the years, Kenya has continued to encourage \r\nthe ICC to expand activities, enhance its work and \r\nimprove its efficiencies and footprint, as the Court \r\nwas created to ensure that the world has a common \r\nplatform to fight impunity. As with other international \r\ninstitutions, we continue to engage robustly, encourage \r\nand provide legislative guidance to the Court to try to \r\nkeep it faithful to our collective objective while keeping \r\nit aligned to the Rome Statute.\r\nThe conclusion in this session’s report (see \r\nA/70/350) is more encouraging than that of the previous \r\nsession. We commend the ICC on the achievement of \r\nthe first appeal judgment on the merits. However, we \r\ncontinue to express our deep regret at the slow pace \r\nof judicial output in the Court’s 12 years of existence, \r\nparticularly in the light of the resources expended, \r\nthe rising expectations of millions and the mounting \r\nneeds for international judicial redress in the world. In \r\na world where multiple communities and countries are \r\ndevastated by horrific wars and clashes and where grave \r\ninjustices go unpunished, that dismal output of tangible \r\nresults by the Court is disheartening and confounding.\r\n10/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nMoreover, Kenya remains deeply concerned by \r\nthe current interpretation and implementation of the \r\nRome Statute, as we have stated several times. There \r\nis growing anxiety and urgency, particularly among \r\nAfrican States, that the manner of the application \r\nof the Rome Statute by the ICC does not augur well \r\nfor the future of the Court. For us, the continued \r\nwrongheaded interpretation of the Statute could very \r\nwell be the undoing of the Court. Clearly, something \r\nis deeply wrong with the collective architecture of the \r\ninternational criminal system at the ICC, for the very \r\nreasons that we have stated before on several occasions.\r\nAs we said at this very rostrum last year (see A/69/\r\nPV.34), when we, the Member States, were forming \r\nthe International Criminal Court, we were convinced \r\nthat we were setting up a Court with higher standards \r\nof practices and procedures than those found in \r\nour national jurisdictions. However, today we find \r\nourselves saddled with a Court that has lower standards \r\nand thresholds than those found in our national courts. \r\nThat ought simply to be unacceptable. To illustrate the \r\npoint, Kenya recalls that during the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute meeting in November \r\n2013, the Assembly made an informed and collective \r\ndecision that the amendments to rule 68, on prior \r\nrecorded testimony, would not be used retroactively \r\nand would not be used in any case before the Court \r\nat that point. Less than a year later, in total disregard \r\nof the collective will and understanding that had been \r\nreached at the Assembly, the prosecution ignored the \r\nlegislative authority of the Assembly and sought to \r\napply the amended rule in the Kenya case. What is more \r\nshocking is that the Court itself has gone ahead to allow \r\nsuch application of rule 68 not only in total disregard \r\nof the basic tenets on the retroactive application of \r\nlaw, but also in full knowledge of the aforementioned \r\nunderstanding and consensus reached at the November \r\n2013 meeting.\r\nIt should be remembered by all that the retroactive \r\napplication of the law does not meet the legal thresholds \r\nin any of our countries, including tribunals and judicial \r\nbodies even at the lowest levels. In the Kenyan case, we \r\nnow find the Prosecutor perpetuating the prosecution of \r\na case with little evidence, and being forced to resort to \r\nthe use of recanted statements. Such statements cannot \r\nbe subjected to cross-examination, as is the requirement \r\nin criminal law. That surely goes against the rights of \r\nan accused person, whether in civil or common law \r\nsystems. Yet we see it playing out at The Hague.\r\nFurthermore, in paragraphs 50 and 51, the report \r\nbefore us today mentions ongoing investigations into \r\nthe situation in Kenya. Recently, the integrity of the \r\ninvestigations in the Kenyan cases have been called into \r\nquestion owing to the alarming but credible revelations \r\nthat the Prosecutor’s witnesses brought before the Court \r\nwere procured with promises of reward. The efficacy of \r\nevidence that is now eight years old has become even \r\nmore suspect. Those devastating revelations of witness \r\ntampering have led to 190 members of the Kenyan \r\nParliament, 50 of whom are from the opposition, to \r\npetition the President of the Security Council as well \r\nas the President of the Assembly of States Parties in \r\nseeking intervention in this eight-year-old case on \r\nKenya that has been at The Hague.\r\nOver the year — that is, in one single year — 4,002 \r\nvictims were admitted to participate in the proceedings \r\nbefore the Court. That is an admirable number. However, \r\nit is Kenya’s experience that the issue of admitting \r\nvictims, while in principle laudable, remains a likely \r\navenue for abuse. Kenya is concerned that adequate \r\nsteps are not in place and the systems do not exist at The \r\nHague to ensure that only genuine victims, and indeed \r\nfor that matter, genuine witnesses, are included in the \r\nproceedings and can avail themselves of the protections \r\nlaid out in the Rome Statute.\r\nKenya, as a situation country, continues to be \r\nacutely aware of the manner in which the ICC operates \r\nand the interpretation it gives to the Rome Statute. As \r\nwe approach another election cycle, we have come to \r\nrecognize that the manner in which the ICC processes \r\nare applied can be prejudicial to the interests of a \r\nMember State, and can have serious consequences to \r\nthe political reality of a country as it goes through its \r\npolitical cycle. The mishandling of those processes can \r\nbe severely disruptive to the political cycle and social \r\nprogress. They can be impact severely on national \r\nhealing after a collective trauma, as Kenya suffered in \r\n2007-2008. They can impact severely on the promotion \r\nof peace and stability and even, sadly, on the pursuit \r\nof truth and justice. It is important, therefore, that the \r\nICC and its cases must not be used or allowed to retard \r\nnational healing or to destabilize countries.\r\nWhat we have found is that bringing all these \r\nconcerns to an Assembly such as this is something \r\nthat is clearly challenging to a delegation such as ours. \r\nWe have noted that notwithstanding the huge financial \r\noutlays provided for the ICC and the pressure on the \r\n15-35401 11/18\r\n06/11/2015 A/70/PV.49\r\nalready overstretched budget that we have seen at the \r\nICC, and despite the growing disquiet about the Court’s \r\nperformance, we remain concerned that any attempts to \r\ndiscuss and question the issues that I have just spoken \r\nabout, both publicly and transparently, continues to be \r\nmet with stiff resistance under the guise of protecting \r\nthe independence of the Court and its organs. We \r\nsimply cannot have a situation where Member States \r\ncannot engage in dialogue over the issues that are of \r\nconcern to Member States and the performance of the \r\nCourt in a situation where bringing up those issues is \r\nmet with ridicule or resistance.\r\nThe report that we have before us rightly states, \r\nin paragraph 100, that national jurisdictions should be \r\nencouraged and assisted by the international community \r\nto address the need for increased capacity in the areas \r\nof the administration of justice and the fight against \r\nimpunity. The ICC was never intended to replace \r\nnational courts, and is therefore a court of last resort. \r\nTherefore, greater emphasis should be accorded to \r\nsupporting national and regional initiatives to promote \r\npeace and to fight impunity in our regions. In that vein, \r\nAfrican States have tried to engage constructively \r\nwith the International Criminal Court, but with little \r\nsuccess. Despite individual and collective efforts \r\nto initiate and develop an enabling environment for \r\nconstructive dialogue with the ICC, they have met with \r\nmarginal success.\r\nFinally, section III B of the report deals with \r\ncooperation with, and assistance from, States, other \r\ninternational organizations and civil society. We note \r\na telling, glaring omission in paragraph 107, namely, \r\nthe absence of any mention of the African Union. One \r\nwould think that, as the bulk of the work that the Court \r\ndeals with is centred in Africa, there would be a greater \r\nand more proactive effort on the part of the Court not \r\nonly to report on that, and the entity that oversees it, \r\nbut to deepen its interactions and cooperation with \r\nthe African Union and individual African States in \r\na manner that reflects these important matters. This \r\nunfortunate state of affairs needs to be discouraged. \r\nAs a way forward, we suggest that high-level Court \r\nofficials, who come through New York quite regularly, \r\nshould hold regular and predictable meetings and \r\nbriefings with the New York African Group whenever \r\nthey travel to the United Nations on business. We note \r\nthat they already do that with other certain regional \r\ngroups, and we call for remedial action from the Court \r\nin that regard.\r\nIn conclusion, the report we have in front of us \r\nfails to tackle the real issues facing the ICC and fails \r\nto offer any insights, as we have said in previous \r\nyears, on possible solutions to improve the work and \r\nrelationship of the ICC with its member States moving \r\nforward. None of the organizational realities and \r\nchallenges that the Court has faced in implementing its \r\nmandate is contained in this report. It lacks analysis \r\nand perspective. Our continued acceptance of the status \r\nquo therefore will only undermine the legitimacy of the \r\nCourt and its core mandate, the fight against impunity. \r\nWe look forward to the new President of the ICC \r\nrectifying those matters in future reports.\r\nMr. Alday González (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Government of Mexico would like to thank \r\nJudge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, for the presentation of \r\nthe eleventh annual report (see A/70/350) of the Court \r\nto the General Assembly, which covers the work of the \r\nCourt from August 2014 to July 2015.\r\nMexico welcomes the accession of the State of \r\nPalestine to the Rome Statute in the period covered by \r\nthe report. The State of Palestine has thus become the \r\n123rd State party to the Rome Statute. Our goal will \r\ncontinue to be working towards the achievement of the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute.\r\nThe report on the work of the Court includes, \r\namong other things, the opening of a new investigation, \r\nthe confirmation of its first verdict and sentence and \r\nthe detention and appearance of the first accused \r\nin the first situation that was referred to the Court’s \r\njurisdiction. Together with the progress made in judicial \r\nproceedings and the increasing participation of victims, \r\nthis shows progressive development in the work of the \r\ntribunal. We note that this week the Trust Fund for \r\nVictims presented its first draft implementation plan \r\nfor collective reparations to victims in connection with \r\nthe Lubanga case.\r\nDespite the instances of progress that I have just \r\nmentioned, the Court is also facing challenges in \r\nfully complying with its mandate. For example, arrest \r\nwarrants issued by the Court remain outstanding \r\nagainst 12 individuals.\r\nSecondly, and related to the point I just made, in \r\nthe period covered by the report, the Court referred to \r\nthe Security Council three findings of non-cooperation \r\npertaining to situations the Council had referred to the \r\nCourt, bringing the total number to 11. It is urgent that \r\n12/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nthe Council, as guarantor of international peace and \r\nsecurity, provide effective follow-up to the situations \r\nthat it has referred to the International Criminal Court, \r\nparticularly when the Court has notified the Council of \r\nnon-cooperation by a given State.\r\nThirdly, it is worth recalling that the powers \r\nconferred upon the Security Council in the Rome \r\nStatute to refer situations to the Court involve a duty \r\ntowards the victims and the international community \r\nas a whole. I reiterate the call of my country for the \r\nSecurity Council to make such referrals on the basis of \r\nobjective and non-politicized criteria. The goal should \r\nbe that the perpetrators of international crimes are \r\neffectively brought before the law and that victims are \r\ncompensated.\r\nWith regard to the role carried out by the Security \r\nCouncil in that area, I should like to underscore the \r\nrecent support by a large number of countries for the \r\ninitiative promoted by my country jointly with France \r\nfor permanent members of the Security Council to \r\ncommit to refrain from exercising their so-called right \r\nto the veto when dealing with situations where mass \r\natrocities have been committed.\r\nThe report presented by the International Criminal \r\nCourt highlights the importance of strengthening \r\ncooperation with the United Nations and proposes some \r\nmeans of achieving that goal. It would be interesting to \r\nexplore those options in order to assess their feasibility.\r\nFinally, the report also mentions the actions taken by \r\nother actors in the international community, including \r\nthe Organization through its specialized entities and \r\nagencies, all of which contribute to efforts to encourage \r\nStates and to help them boost their capacities to improve \r\ntheir justice systems and accountability mechanisms. \r\nAs Mexico has highlighted on many occasions, it is \r\nprecisely in such forums with an explicit mandate in \r\nthat regard where it is extremely relevant to promote \r\nsuch efforts, rather than in the Court itself, which, as a \r\nfully judicial tribunal, has no such mandate.\r\nMexico acknowledges and underscores the importance \r\nof the work of the International Criminal Court as \r\npresented in the report under consideration at the \r\npresent session. We encourage the Court to continue \r\nstrengthening its work strictly within the framework of \r\nthe Rome Statute.\r\nMs. Guillén-Grillo (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation would like to express its gratitude for the \r\ndetailed and accurate report (see A/70/350) presented \r\nby the President of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi. Costa \r\nRica welcomes her election and would like to assure \r\nher of our support as she carries out the important \r\nfunctions entrusted to her. At the same time, we would \r\nlike to congratulate her on the steps that have begun \r\nto be taken in order to increase the efficiency and \r\neffectiveness of the Court.\r\nCosta Rica wishes to reiterate its full support for \r\nthe Court. We are entirely convinced that it is one of \r\nthe most important achievements of multilateralism \r\nand an outcome of the willingness on the part of the \r\ninternational community to achieve two goals. The \r\nfirst was to put an end to impunity for the most serious \r\ncrimes against humanity, regardless of who commits \r\nsuch crimes. The second, no less important aim, was to \r\nprovide justice to victims. Because that is a universal \r\naspiration, the world requires that there be no room \r\nfor impunity in any State. In that regard, Costa Rica \r\nwelcomes the accession of Palestine to the Rome \r\nStatute, which brings the number of States parties to \r\n123. We reiterate the importance of continued efforts to \r\npromote ratification of the Statute until it is universal.\r\nWith regard to the common goal of putting an end \r\nto impunity for atrocity crimes, my delegation recalls \r\nthat the ICC is a Court of last resort and was not created \r\nto replace domestic courts. The responsibility to \r\ninvestigate and prosecute crimes under its jurisdiction \r\nbelongs first to the justice systems of each State. That \r\nis why complementarity is an essential element of \r\nentrenching a system of international criminal justice. \r\nNevertheless, it is important to be clear that, once the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction is activated in accordance with the \r\nRome Statute, States parties must fulfil the unavoidable \r\nresponsibilities that f low from the Statute. In that \r\nregard, cooperation with the Court is key not only for \r\naccountability, but also because any lack of cooperation \r\nmeans that victims are prevented from seeing justice \r\ndone and receiving the reparations that they call for and \r\ndeserve. Our main obligation is to victims.\r\nThe next point I should like to mention is the \r\nfinancial situation of the Court, and the possibility that, \r\nowing to budget constraints, the Court’s very important \r\nwork could be threatened. The Court currently has the \r\nheaviest workload in its history. We cannot allow its \r\nwork and its effective responses to be contingent on an \r\ninappropriate budget. Costa Rica is convinced that the \r\nbenefits of investing in international justice for peace, \r\n15-35401 13/18\r\n06/11/2015 A/70/PV.49\r\ncoexistence and human dignity will far surpass the \r\ncosts.\r\nWith regard to that point, my delegation would \r\nlike to refer to cooperation between the Court and the \r\nUnited Nations, which is based on the relationship \r\nagreement between the two organizations signed on \r\n14 October 2004. That cooperation has been developing \r\nin a positive way and has led to tangible benefits for \r\nboth organizations. Nevertheless, Costa Rica once \r\nagain reiterates the need to address the issue of the \r\nfinancing of activities as a result of the referral of cases \r\nto the Criminal Court by the United Nations. Due to \r\nthe fact that the Charter of the United Nations confers \r\nthe responsibility for international peace and security \r\non the Security Council, in taking on such referrals the \r\nCourt is helping the Council to fulfil its mandate. In \r\nsuch cases of cooperation, article 13 of the Agreement \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations should be \r\nimplemented without delay. That article calls for an \r\neconomic contribution by the United Nations for the \r\nactivities of the Court. The agreement is clear in that \r\nsuch contributions should be made through decisions \r\nof the General Assembly. My delegation hopes that \r\nsuch support will very soon materialize via the proper \r\nchannels.\r\nWith regard to referrals, my delegation reiterates \r\nthat the Security Council would benefit from a \r\nuniform, predictable and transparent protocol for \r\nreferring cases to the Court. On this issue Costa Rica \r\nwelcomes France’s proposal for permanent members of \r\nthe Council to adhere to a code of conduct by which \r\nthey commit themselves not to use the veto cases \r\ninvolving mass atrocities. We also support the proposal \r\nof Liechtenstein on behalf of the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group to establish a \r\nbroader and more concrete code of conduct.\r\nWith regard to the geographical location of the \r\ncases before the Court and the insinuation that it is due \r\nto a biased Court, my delegation would respectfully like \r\nto recall that, of the nine situations before the Court, \r\nfive were referred by States themselves. Another two \r\nsituations were referred to the Court by the Security \r\nCouncil. Therefore, only two of the situations were \r\nraised by the Prosecutor’s Office. In addition, one of \r\nthose situations was raised following a declaration \r\nby the State involved under article 12.3 of the Rome \r\nStatute. I mention this by way of clarification for the \r\nbenefit of those who may have had any doubts. We would \r\nalso like to recall that the 10 preliminary examinations \r\ncarried out by the Prosecutor in the period covered by \r\nthe report represent cases across three continents.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reiterates its full \r\ncommitment to the international criminal justice \r\nsystem and to the International Criminal Court. We \r\nrespectfully call on the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council to continue supporting the fight \r\nagainst impunity and to continue to support efforts to \r\nbring justice to the victims of mass atrocities.\r\nMr. Lasso Mendoza (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Ecuador would like to acknowldge \r\nthe presence at the General Assembly of the President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC), Judge \r\nSilvia Fernández de Gurmendi, to present the report \r\n(see A/70/350) on the work of the Court in the period \r\nspanning 2014-2015, dated 28 August.\r\nThe delegation of Ecuador welcomes the report, \r\nwhich relates, among other things, the following \r\nachievements: preliminary examinations conducted \r\nby the Prosecutor, rulings of the Court on appeals \r\nproceedings, the election of seven new judges and of \r\nthe President of the Court, the election of the President \r\nof the Assembly of States Parties and the accession of \r\nPalestine, which became the 123rd State party to the \r\nStatute — a significant step towards the much-hoped-\r\nfor universality of the Rome Statute.\r\nEcuador reiterates its support for the Court as a \r\nmechanism that has unique characteristics to fight \r\nimpunity. We call on all States gathered here to provide \r\ntheir support so that the Court can effectively and \r\ntangibly exercise its jurisdiction over individuals in \r\nconnection with its competence on the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community. \r\nThe crime of genocide, crimes against humanity, war \r\ncrimes and crimes of aggression, which are subject \r\nto the complementary jurisdiction of the Court, can \r\nbe adequately prosecuted only if there is universal \r\nadherence by States to the Statute and if they provide \r\nthe necessary cooperation to the Court. Certainly, \r\nthat is the least we can do in the light of the fact that \r\nthroughout its history humankind has witnessed so many \r\nevents, including ones that continue in the present, that \r\nhave resulted in so many victims — children, men and \r\nwomen — of unimaginable atrocities that boggle the \r\nmind and deeply move the conscience of humankind, as \r\nhighlighted by the preamble to the Statute.\r\nHowever, Ecuador is very concerned about efforts \r\nto politicize and abuse the Rome Statute. My country \r\n14/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nrejects such efforts as attempting to create artificial \r\nenvironments to implement the Statute so as to give \r\njurisdiction and competence to the Court — for example, \r\nthrough the resolutions of the Third Committee. That is \r\nall the more inappropriate given that the Statute allows \r\ncountries to bring cases to the Court directly through \r\nthe Security Council. Ecuador does not agree with that \r\nprovision of the Statute, as it creates abuses. There are \r\nvalid alternatives to beginning judicial proceedings to \r\nfight impunity without having to politicize justice.\r\nAnother issue of concern to Ecuador has to do with \r\nthe cost entailed in the referrals made by the Security \r\nCouncil to the Court. Such costs should be borne by \r\nthe United Nations in accordance with its relationship \r\nagreement with the Court, which the General Assembly \r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nMy country advocates for the universality of the \r\nStatute. It is a matter of combating impunity in the \r\nframework of an open multilateral treaty, as is the \r\nRome Statute. Therein also lies the importance of the \r\namendments to the Rome Statute adopted in Kampala \r\nin 2010. What we adopted in Kampala should bind all \r\nof us. However, in order to encourage States to ratify \r\nthe amendments and make progress in the fight against \r\nimpunity, it is essential for other States also to accede \r\nto the Statute, particularly those that use it politically \r\nwithout being a State party to the Statute. I must \r\npoint out that the political constitution of my country \r\ncontains a provision regarding no statute of limitations \r\nfor the crime of aggression, thereby adhering to the \r\nfundamental principles set out in the Rome Statute. \r\nCombating impunity is a cross-cutting element in the \r\nwork of the United Nations. My country stands prepared \r\nto cooperate in the area of international law.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): My first words \r\nare to congratulate Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi \r\non her election as President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). Brazil is particularly pleased \r\nto note that four of the main offices of the ICC — its \r\npresidency, both vice-presidencies and the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor — are currently held by women. I join \r\nothers in thanking Judge Fernández de Gurmendi for \r\npresenting the Court’s annual report (see A/70/350) to \r\nthe General Assembly. I also take this opportunity to \r\ncommend the Court for contributing to the fight against \r\nimpunity and for promoting respect for the rule of law.\r\nBrazil remains steadfast in its commitment to the \r\nRome Statute system and to the cause of justice, which \r\nmotivated its establishment. As an instrument for \r\nensuring that those accused before it are judged with \r\nfairness and full respect for their human rights, the ICC \r\nis a vehicle for justice and peace. The foundations of \r\nthe legitimacy of the Rome Statute system lie not only \r\nin the independence of its organs, but also in its reach. \r\nEnhancing the universality of the Rome Statute will \r\ncontribute to dispel the misperception of selectivity \r\nregarding the Court’s activities.\r\nI am pleased to recall not only that all South American \r\ncountries are parties to the Rome Statute, but also that \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean represents the second-\r\nlargest regional group among the States parties — only \r\nbehind the Group of African States. Approximately two \r\nthirds of the United Nations membership has ratified \r\nthe Rome Statute, but it is still not universal. Every new \r\nratification is an important step towards the promotion \r\nof peace and justice. Brazil welcomes the accession of \r\nPalestine to the Statute. States that exercise their right \r\nto join multilateral treaties, especially those conceived \r\nfor defending human rights and combating impunity, \r\nshould be welcomed, rather than met with reprisals and \r\nsanctions.\r\nIn that context, allow me to underscore the \r\nimportance we attach to the outcomes of the \r\nKampala Review Conference, in which Brazil was \r\nan active participant. We are convinced that the \r\nactivation of the amendment regarding the crime of \r\naggression — hopefully by 2017 — will represent a \r\nmajor contribution to completing the international \r\ncriminal justice system.\r\nAs reported by President Fernández de Gurmendi, \r\nthe ICC has reached an unprecedented level of activity, \r\nand its workload is increasing significantly. In that \r\ncontext, I should like to recall my delegation’s concern \r\nwith regard to the financing of Security Council \r\nreferrals, an issue of a structural nature that goes to \r\nthe core of the relationship between the Court and the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular the General Assembly. \r\nOnce again we reiterate our call for the implementation \r\nof article 13 of the Relationship Agreement and of \r\narticle 115 (b) of the Rome Statute, which provide clear \r\nguidance in the sense that such costs should be met \r\nby the United Nations and not fall to the parties to the \r\nRome Statute. It is equally important to highlight that, \r\nas set out in Article 17 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the General Assembly has the exclusive — and \r\nI underline exclusive — responsibility to consider and \r\napprove the budget of the Organization.\r\n15-35401 15/18\r\n06/11/2015 A/70/PV.49\r\nProper funding of Security Council referrals will \r\nenhance the credibility of both the ICC and the United \r\nNations. The current situation is not sustainable, as \r\nillustrated on 5 November when the ICC Prosecutor \r\ncalled attention (see S/PV.7549), in her tenth report \r\nto the Security Council on the situation in Libya, to \r\nresource constraints that will prevent her Office from \r\nconducting additional investigative activities on Libya.\r\nThe pursuit of international justice and the \r\nachievement of lasting peace and security are mutually \r\nreinforcing objectives. Both the ICC and the Security \r\nCouncil have pivotal, albeit different, roles in pursuing \r\nthose objectives in a uniform manner and without \r\nselectivity. The quest for peace and justice is fraught \r\nwith challenges. It is a common purpose of both the \r\nUnited Nations and the ICC. Our efforts in that regard \r\nmust be informed by the shared values that bring the \r\nAssembly together and have made the first permanent, \r\ntreaty-based International Criminal Court a reality.\r\nMr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): Let me, at the \r\noutset, convey my delegation’s congratulations and \r\ngratitude to Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi on \r\nher ascendance to the presidency of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) as well as for her very insightful \r\nbrief to the General Assembly. My delegation expresses \r\nits readiness and willingness to support her and other \r\nnewly elected judges of the Court in the discharge of \r\nthe Court’s mandate. We also wish to offer our support \r\nto the President of the Assembly of States Parties for \r\nthe continued discharge of his mandate.\r\nBotswana remains a strong supporter and friend \r\nof the ICC. To that end, we reiterate our unwavering \r\ncommitment to contributing to a strong, effective and \r\naccountable international criminal justice system based \r\non respect for the rule of law. Ever since its establishment, \r\nin 2002, the ICC has played a critical role in the lives \r\nof millions of people as a permanent court of last resort \r\nfor victims of genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes. From all corners of the globe, the Court \r\ncontinues to be a useful deterrent in pushing back \r\nthe frontiers of impunity, promoting the protection of \r\nhuman rights and working with other stakeholders to \r\nbring justice to victims of mass atrocities. The Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court recognizes \r\nthat States have the first responsibility and right to \r\nprosecute international crimes. Where national legal \r\nsystems either fail or are unwilling or unable to do so, \r\nthen the Court may exercise its jurisdiction over such \r\ncrimes.\r\nAs former Prosecutor Luis Moreno-Ocampo once \r\nsaid,\r\n“As a consequence of complementarity, the \r\nnumber of cases that reach the Court should not \r\nbe a measure of its efficiency. On the contrary, the \r\nabsence of trials before the Court, as a consequence \r\nof the regular functioning of national jurisdictions, \r\nwould be a major success.”\r\nWe therefore wish to appreciate the support and \r\ncooperation the Court continues to receive from various \r\nStates parties, as well as non-State parties, to investigate \r\ncases and situations under the Court’s jurisdiction. We \r\nwelcome with appreciation the report (see A/70/350) \r\ndelivered to the Assembly by the President of the \r\nCourt on the activities of the Court covering the period \r\nAugust 2014 to the end of July 2015. We take note that, \r\ncurrently, the Court is seized of 21 cases and eight \r\nsituations, mainly on the African continent. We are also \r\nwell aware of the complexity, character and nature of \r\nthe cases before the Court, as well as potential ones.\r\nWe remain convinced that there are numerous \r\nother potential cases deserving of the Court’s attention. \r\nWe also recognize that, in order to achieve full \r\naccountability for the gravest international crimes, \r\nthe Court depends entirely on the willingness and \r\nreadiness of States to cooperate and enable it to have \r\na universal outreach. In that respect, we welcome the \r\nsupport and assistance the Court continues to receive \r\nfrom the United Nations system, as well as from civil \r\nsociety and States parties, to promote the rule of law \r\nat the national and international levels. We know that \r\nthese present a profound challenge to the Court in its \r\npursuit to make perpetrators of human rights abuses \r\naccount for their deeds. As human rights violations and \r\natrocity crimes continue to take place in other parts of \r\nthe world, we call on some members of the Security \r\nCouncil to refrain from frustrating initiatives to refer \r\ndeserving cases to the ICC. We believe that in doing so \r\nthe Council would enable the Court to cast its net wide \r\nand would not be perceived to be unfairly targeting \r\ncertain regions of the world.\r\nWe look forward to continuing to support the \r\nInternational Criminal Court in its quest to fight \r\nagainst impunity and to bring justice to the millions of \r\nmen, women and children. We believe that the Security \r\nCouncil can do more to enable the ICC to complement \r\nthe principles and purposes of the Charter of the United \r\nNations in relation to justice and the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\n16/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nMr. Martinsen (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, I should like to express the particular \r\nsatisfaction of the Argentine Republic upon receiving \r\nthis first report (see A/70/350) of the new President \r\nof the Court, our compatriot Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi, as well as to warmly congratulate her on \r\nher election. I should also like to express gratitude \r\nfor the presentation of the report (A/70/317) of the \r\nSecretary-General on the implementation of article 3 of \r\nthe relationship agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court and the report \r\n(A/70/346) on expenditures and reimbursements in \r\nrelation to assistance provided to the Court.\r\nWith regard to the update on the judicial activities \r\nof the Court and the activities of the Office of the \r\nProsecutor, we welcome the fact that it has been \r\npossible to move forward with activities both in terms \r\nof preliminary examinations and situations and cases \r\nunder the charge of the Court in fulfilment of its \r\nmandate and within the limit of the resources that have \r\nbeen allocated for that purpose. We call on all Member \r\nStates that are parties to the Rome Statute to bear in \r\nmind the particular nature of the Court as they evaluate \r\ntheir own annual budgets, so that the Court’s budget can \r\nbe approved at the next Assembly of States parties in \r\norder to allow the Court to fulfil its mandate and carry \r\nout its essential functions. We also encourage States to \r\npromote the streamlining of processes through positive \r\nconsideration of the proposed amendments to the rules \r\nof procedure and rules of proof drafted by judges and \r\ndebated within the focus group on governance.\r\nWith regard to the report’s section on international \r\ncooperation, I should like to refer to the relationship of \r\nthe Court with the United Nations. Over the years since \r\nthe entry into force of the Statute, the need to ensure \r\ngreater accountability for crimes covered by the Rome \r\nStatute has been concretely integrated in United Nations \r\ndeliberations and those of the international community \r\nas a whole. The Security Council has done the same and \r\nhas incorporated the Court into its own consideration of \r\nspecific situations. All of that has served to strengthen \r\nthe fight against impunity. However, certain challenges \r\nremain that ought to be addressed.\r\nThe relationship between the Organization and \r\nthe Court is crucial and should always respect the \r\njudicial independence of the Court. I should like to \r\nrecognize the directives of the Secretary-General on \r\nnon-essential contacts. The relationship between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Court is also characterized \r\nby the relationship of the Court with the Security \r\nCouncil. That organ is empowered to make referrals to \r\nthe Court, which it has in fact done in two situations. \r\nFor years, Argentina has expressed some concerns, \r\nboth in the General Assembly and in the Security \r\nCouncil as a non-permanent member. In accordance \r\nwith the Rome Statute, when it comes to referrals the \r\nCourt exercises its jurisdiction over nationals of States \r\nparties and the nationals of non-States parties to the \r\nStatute. No decision by the Security Council has the \r\ncapacity to change the norms of the Statute with regard \r\nto the jurisdiction of the Court to provide immunity to \r\nnationals of non-States parties who commit crimes that \r\nare covered by the Statute. That is in the context of a \r\nsituation that is referred to the Court.\r\nI should like to reiterate that to date the financial \r\ncost of the referrals made by the Security Council to \r\nthe Court have been covered exclusively by States \r\nparties. The Rome Statute provides that such costs must \r\nbe borne by the United Nations. That is also reflected \r\nin the Relationship Agreement between the United \r\nNations and the Court, which the Assembly adopted by \r\nconsensus. Argentina and other Members of the United \r\nNations have questioned the unfortunate practice of the \r\nSecurity Council in terms of funding those referrals, \r\ndespite the fact that a large majority supports full \r\ncompliance with sub-paragraph (b) of article 115 of \r\nthe Rome Statute and article 13 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement. Fighting impunity is a goal of the States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute and of the United Nations. \r\nBut that objective also needs to be accompanied by a \r\ncommitment to provide the Court with the necessary \r\nresources to fulfil its functions. That commitment is \r\nnot an alien concept at the United Nations, given the \r\nexperience with the ad hoc Tribunals set up by the \r\nCouncil. We now need to address the issue as it relates \r\nto the International Criminal Court. The lack of action \r\nin that regard could jeopardize the sustainability of the \r\ninvestigations carried out by the Court and can have an \r\nimpact on the credibility of the Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, Argentina would like to emphasize \r\nthat the significant contribution of the International \r\nCriminal Court to fighting impunity for the most serious \r\ncrimes of international concern is also a contribution \r\nto the objectives of the Organization. As indicated \r\nin the Kampala Declaration, there is a noble mission \r\nand function of the International Criminal Court in \r\nthe multilateral system, the objective of putting an \r\nend to impunity, establishing the rule of law, fostering \r\nrespect for human rights and achieving lasting peace \r\n15-35401 17/18\r\n06/11/2015 A/70/PV.49\r\nin accordance with international law and the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nreiterate the firm commitment of our country to the \r\nwork of the International Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Minami (Japan):At the outset, I should like \r\nto thank President Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi for \r\nher comprehensive report (see A/70/350) on the work of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC). Japan’s basic \r\npolicy towards the Court is to enable it to function \r\neffectively in a sustainable manner, with the support of \r\nthe international community. Japan is proud of being \r\nthe largest financial contributor and of sending capable \r\nhuman resources, including judges, to the Court.\r\nWhile the ICC has demonstrated progress in the \r\npast 13 years, some challenges still remain. One of them \r\nis the sustainability of the Court. The Court has been \r\nexercising its jurisdiction over nine situations, more \r\nthan 10 suspects remain at large and nine preliminary \r\nexaminations are still going on. However, its financial \r\nand human resources are limited and should be used \r\nin a most efficient manner. My delegation supports \r\nthe lessons-learned initiative of the Court and closely \r\nfollows the work of the study group on governance in \r\nThe Hague.\r\nAnother challenge is the effectiveness of the Court. \r\nWe see issues related to executing arrest warrants and \r\ncollecting evidence. Its experience in the past 13 years \r\ntells us that cooperation among the States concerned \r\nis one of the key elements for a more effective \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that capacity-building \r\nin legislation and the criminal justice systems of the \r\nStates concerned can serve justice and reconciliation, \r\nand thereby contribute to effective cooperation from \r\nthem. Enhanced capacity will also enable national \r\nauthorities in the States concerned to conduct \r\ninvestigation, prosecution and punishment in close \r\ncooperation with the international community. Japan is \r\nwilling to play a positive role in the field of capacity-\r\nbuilding.\r\nCooperation is also crucial in situations referred \r\nto the Court by the Security Council. The ICC can \r\nfunction more effectively when the Council follows \r\nup such situations in close cooperation with the Court \r\nand the States concerned. With the support of Member \r\nStates, Japan will become a member of the Security \r\nCouncil from January next year. My delegation wishes \r\nto contribute to further deepening dialogue and \r\ncooperation between the two bodies from inside the \r\nCouncil.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express the sincere \r\nappreciation of Japan for the work that the ICC has \r\naccomplished to date. It is our hope that the ICC will \r\ncontinue to work diligently in the fight against impunity \r\nand to consolidate its credibility and reputation both \r\ninside and outside the Rome Statute system. Japan, for \r\nits part, is determined to strengthen its contribution to \r\nthe ICC, and consequently to the establishment of the \r\nrule of law in the international community.\r\nMr. Rhee Zha-hyoung (Republic of Korea): At the \r\noutset, we would like to extend our warm congratulations \r\nto President Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, together \r\nwith the two Vice-Presidents, on their elections to the \r\npresidency of the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\nWe also welcome the seven judges newly elected during \r\nthe reporting period. While thanking the President \r\nfor her comprehensive presentation of the report \r\n(see A/70/350), we cannot fail to express our sincere \r\nappreciation to those in all organs of the Court for their \r\nhard work and dedication.\r\nAs emphasized by previous speakers, the Rome \r\nStatute reaffirms the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. As we are all aware, the \r\nthree pillars of the work of the United Nations — peace \r\nand security, development and human rights — depend \r\nheavily on securing criminal justice at both national and \r\ninternational levels, especially for those serious crimes \r\nof concern to the international community as a whole. \r\nThat is all the more so considering the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (General Assembly resolution \r\n70/1), which includes various elements concerning \r\njustice, the rule of law and accountability. In that \r\nregard, we support the ongoing cooperation between \r\nthe ICC and the United Nations on various levels, as \r\npresented in the report and the presentation, especially \r\nthose cooperative activities in the field.\r\nFor the past 13 years, the ICC has been making \r\nsteady contributions to helping end impunity for the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes, and its work \r\nis laudable. That being the case, the ICC, now as a \r\nteenager on its path to adulthood, has to overcome a \r\nnumber of growing pains to establish itself as a robust \r\nand solid institution for international criminal justice.\r\nFirst, it is imperative that the ICC enhance \r\nefficiency at various stages, especially given the \r\nexpectation of four trials running simultaneously next \r\n18/18 15-35401\r\nA/70/PV.49 06/11/2015\r\nyear and of heavier caseloads for the following years. In \r\nthat regard, we welcome the remarks by the President \r\nthat all organs of the Court are actively engaged in \r\nimportant reforms towards enhancing the effectiveness \r\nand efficiency of the institution, and hope for continued \r\nefforts to achieve that goal. We especially appreciate \r\nthe recent publication of the pre-trial practice manual.\r\nSecondly, the number of States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute has more than doubled since the Statute’s \r\nentry into force, in 2002. That is truly a remarkable \r\nachievement. Nevertheless, the number still falls short \r\nof the two thirds of the States Members of the United \r\nNations. Securing universality is part and parcel of \r\nending impunity for perpetrators of atrocity crimes \r\nwherever such crimes are committed. It also helps to \r\nenhance the credibility of the Court and the deterrence \r\nof crimes. As such, continued efforts for universality \r\nshould be made by both the Court and States parties.\r\nThirdly, cooperation at every step of the \r\nprocess continues to be an essential component of \r\nthe effectiveness of the Court and of the genuine \r\nmeaningfulness of universality. Cooperation \r\nbetween the ICC and States parties is vital and has \r\nbeen reinforced by the Assembly of States Parties, \r\ninternational organizations, civil society organizations \r\nand non-party Member States as well. It is quite \r\nencouraging that two suspects were transferred to the \r\nICC with the cooperation of States parties during the \r\nreporting period. However, as is still the case, the ICC \r\nsuffers from a lack of full cooperation. States parties \r\nmust be further encouraged to investigate grave crimes \r\nwithin their borders and prosecute or extradite the \r\ncriminals based on the principle of complementarity. \r\nThe ICC, together with States parties and other entities \r\nmentioned above, must help improve the judicial \r\ncapacity and overall competency of States parties at the \r\nnational level by offering assistance and expertise. In \r\ncases of non-compliance or non-cooperation, we must \r\nassess the underlying reasons and develop strategies to \r\nencourage more cooperative engagement.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has been a staunch supporter \r\nof the ICC since its inception. As a member of the \r\nBureau, we are actively participating in the concerted \r\nefforts to establish the ICC as the responsible, \r\nuniversal and efficient institution to end impunity for \r\nthe perpetrators of the most serious crimes against \r\nhumankind. We will continue to spare no effort in that \r\nnoble and significant endeavour, both at the ICC and at \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 78?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m.\r\n"
