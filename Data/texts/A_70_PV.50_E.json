Those Member \r\nStates are eligible for immediate re-election.\r\nI should like to remind members that as of \r\n27 June 2016, the following States will continue to be \r\nrepresented in the Commission: Armenia, Bulgaria, \r\nCameroon, Canada, China, Côte d’Ivoire, Denmark, \r\nEcuador, El Salvador, France, Germany, Greece, \r\nHonduras, Hungary, Indonesia, Japan, Kuwait, Liberia, \r\nMalaysia, Mauritania, Mexico, Namibia, Panama, \r\nthe Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, Sierra \r\nLeone, Singapore, Switzerland, the United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland and Zambia. \r\nTherefore, those 30 States are not eligible for election.\r\nThe General Assembly will now proceed to the \r\nelection of 30 members to replace those members whose \r\nterm of office will expire on 27 June 2016.\r\nIn accordance with rule 92 of the General \r\nAssembly rules of procedure, the election will be held \r\nby secret ballot and there will be no nominations. I \r\nshould like to recall, however, paragraph 16 of decision \r\n34/401, whereby the practice of dispensing with the \r\nsecret ballot for elections to subsidiary organs when \r\nthe number of candidates corresponds to the number \r\nof seats to be filled should become standard unless \r\na delegation specifically requests a vote on a given \r\nelection. In the absence of such a request, may I take it \r\nthat the Assembly decides to proceed to the election on \r\nthe basis of dispensing with the secret ballot?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: With regard to candidates, I \r\nshould like to inform members of the following. For \r\nthe seven seats from among the African States, there \r\nis one candidate: Mauritius. For the seven seats \r\namong the Asia-Pacific States, the group has endorsed \r\nsix candidates: India, the Islamic Republic of Iran, \r\nLebanon, Pakistan, the Philippines and Thailand. For \r\nthe four seats among the Eastern European States, \r\nthe group has endorsed four candidates: Belarus, the \r\nCzech Republic, Poland and Romania. For the five seats \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States, there \r\nare five endorsed candidates: Argentina, Brazil, Chile, \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.50\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n50th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 9 November 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/4 15-35537\r\nA/70/PV.50 09/11/2015\r\nColombia and the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nFor the seven seats among the Western European and \r\nother States, there are seven endorsed candidates: \r\nAustralia, Austria, Israel, Italy, Spain, Turkey and the \r\nUnited States of America.\r\nSince the number of candidates for the five regional \r\ngroups is equal to or less than the number of seats to \r\nbe filled by each group, may I take it that the General \r\nAssembly wishes to declare those candidates elected \r\nfor a six-year term beginning on 27 June 2016?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I congratulate the following States, \r\nwhich have been elected as members of the United \r\nNations Commission on International Trade Law for a \r\nsix-year term beginning on 27 June 2016: Argentina, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Belarus, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, \r\nthe Czech Republic, India, Israel, the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, Italy, Lebanon, Mauritius, Pakistan, the \r\nPhilippines, Poland, Romania, Spain, Thailand, Turkey, \r\nthe United States of America and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela.\r\nRegarding the six remaining vacancies from the \r\nGroup of African States and the one remaining vacancy \r\nfrom the Group of Asia-Pacific States, the General \r\nAssembly will hold elections upon notification by \r\ninterested Member States from those two regions.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 113.\r\nAgenda item 114 (continued)\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments\r\n(e) Appointment of members of the Committee \r\non Conferences\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/70/107)\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has before it \r\na note by the Secretary-General circulated in document \r\nA/70/107. As indicated in that document, since the \r\nterm of office of the representatives of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Côte d’Ivoire, Iraq, Israel, Peru, Senegal \r\nand Uruguay will expire on 31 December 2015, it will be \r\nnecessary for the President of the General Assembly to \r\nappoint seven members to fill the resulting vacancies. \r\nThese members will serve for a period of three years \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2016.\r\nOn the recommendation of the Chair of the Group \r\nof African States, I have endorsed Ghana and Liberia as \r\nmembers of the Committee on Conferences for a period \r\nof three years beginning on 1 January 2016. May I take \r\nit that the Assembly takes note of these appointments?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: I should like to remind members \r\nthat one seat from the Asia-Pacific States, one seat from \r\nthe Eastern European States, two seats from the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States and one seat from the \r\nWestern European and other States, for a period of two \r\nyears beginning on 1 January 2016, remain vacant. I \r\nurge these groups to submit their candidates as soon as \r\npossible.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (e) of agenda item 114.\r\n(f) Appointment of members of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/70/106)\r\nThe President: As indicated in the note by the \r\nSecretary-General, the General Assembly is required \r\nduring the current session to appoint a member to fill \r\nthe vacancy in the Joint Inspection Unit that will arise \r\nfrom the expiration of the term of office on 31 December \r\n2016 of Mr. Jorge Flores Callejas (Honduras).\r\nAs also indicated in document A/70/106, in \r\naccordance with paragraph 1 of article 3 of the \r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, the President \r\nof the General Assembly will consult with Member \r\nStates to draw up a list of countries — in this case, \r\none country — which would be requested to propose \r\na candidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection \r\nUnit. As further indicated in paragraph 2 of document \r\nA/70/106, the General Assembly, by its resolution \r\n61/238 decided that, beginning on 1 January 2008, \r\nthe President of the General Assembly, when drawing \r\nup the list of countries in accordance with article 3, \r\nparagraph 1, of the statute of the Unit, would invite \r\nMember States to submit the names of the countries \r\nand their respective candidates simultaneously, on the \r\nunderstanding that the candidates submitted were the \r\ncandidates that the respective Member States intend to \r\npropose, to the extent possible, for appointment by the \r\nAssembly in accordance with article 3, paragraph 2, on \r\nthe statute.\r\n15-35537 3/4\r\n09/11/2015 A/70/PV.50\r\nAfter holding the necessary consultations, I should \r\nlike to communicate to the Assembly the information \r\nreceived from the Chair of the Group of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States that the Group has endorsed \r\nHonduras as the country that will propose a candidate \r\nfor the vacancy from among the Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States. In accordance with paragraph 1 of \r\narticle 3, of the statute of the Joint Inspection Unit and \r\nresolution 61/238, of 22 December 2006, Honduras \r\nwill be requested to submit the name of the candidate \r\nand the curriculum vitae highlighting the candidate’s \r\nrelevant qualifications for the task.\r\nI would like to remind members that, in accordance \r\nwith resolution 59/267, of 23 December 2004, the \r\ncandidates should have experience in at least one \r\nof the following fields: oversight, audit, inspection, \r\ninvestigation, evaluation, finance, project evaluation, \r\nprogramme evaluation, human resources management, \r\nmanagement, public administration, monitoring and \r\nall-programme performance as well as knowledge of \r\nthe United Nations system and its role in international \r\nrelations.\r\nAfter holding the appropriate consultations \r\ndescribed in paragraph 2 of article 3 of the statute of \r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit, including consultations with \r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council and \r\nwith the Secretary-General, in his capacity as Chair of \r\nthe United Nations System Chief Executives Board for \r\nCoordination, I will submit the name of the candidate \r\nto the Assembly for appointment to the Joint Inspection \r\nUnit.\r\nWe have thus concluded this stage of our \r\nconsideration of sub-item (f) of agenda item 114.\r\nAgenda item 112 (continued)\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council\r\nThe President: The General Assembly will now \r\nproceed to hold a by-election to elect one member of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, in accordance with rule \r\n140 of the rules of procedure.

In his letter, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Ireland, in his capacity \r\nas Chair of the Group of Western European and other \r\nStates, announces that Austria will relinquish its seat \r\non the Economic and Social Council at the end of the \r\nyear 2015 for the remainder of the 2015-2017 term, in \r\nfavour of Ireland. As a result, one vacancy will occur \r\nand a new member must therefore be elected to fill the \r\nunexpired term of office of Austria, commencing on \r\n1 January 2016 and expiring on 31 December 2017.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of resolution 2847 \r\n(XXVI), adopted on 20 December 1971, and taking \r\ninto account that the vacancy will occur in the Group \r\nof Western European and other States, the new member \r\nshould therefore be elected from that regional group. I \r\nshould like to inform the Assembly that the candidate \r\nwho receives a two-thirds majority and the greatest \r\nnumber of votes by members present and voting will be \r\ndeclared elected.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with rule 92 of the \r\nrules of procedure, the election will be held by secret \r\nballot, and there will be no nominations. We shall now \r\nproceed accordingly.\r\nI should like to inform members that, as of 1 January \r\n2016, the following States from among the Western \r\nEuropean and other States will be represented on the \r\nEconomic and Social Council: Australia, Belgium, \r\nFinland, France, Italy, Germany, Greece, Portugal, \r\nSwitzerland, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and \r\nNorthern Ireland and the United States of America The \r\nnames of those 11 States should therefore not appear on \r\nthe ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\n4/4 15-35537\r\nA/70/PV.50 09/11/2015\r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given solely to the delegate seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s name plate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have been \r\ncollected. I would like to remind members that, at this \r\nstage, they are voting in the by-election for one seat for \r\nthe Western European and other States. Ballot papers \r\nwill now be distributed. I request representatives to use \r\nonly those ballot papers and to write on them the name \r\nof the State for which they wish to vote. A ballot will be \r\ndeclared invalid if it contains more names of Member \r\nStates from the relevant region than the number of seats \r\nassigned to it. A ballot will also be declared invalid if \r\nall the names of the Member States on that ballot do not \r\nbelong to the relevant region.\r\nAt the invitation of the President, Mrs. Loko \r\n(Benin), Mr. Dos Santos Pereira (Brazil), Ms. Hung \r\n(Canada), Mr. Stefanik (Poland), Mrs. Thanarat \r\n(Thailand) and Ms. Magnon (Togo) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.35 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11 a.m.\r\nThe President: The result of the voting is as \r\nfollows:\r\nWestern European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers: 179\r\nNumber of invalid ballots: 1\r\nNumber of valid ballots: 178\r\nAbstentions: 5\r\nNumber of members present and voting: 173\r\nRequired two-thirds majority: 116\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nIreland 172\r\nIceland 1\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nIreland was elected a member of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council for a term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2016 and ending on 31 December 2017.\r\nThe President: I congratulate Ireland on having \r\nbeen elected a member of the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil l, and I thank the tellers for their assistance in \r\nthis election.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 112.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.05 a.m.\r\n"
