In that connection, the General Assembly \r\nhas before it a note by the Secretary-General issued as \r\ndocument A/70/300.\r\nMay I take it that the Assembly takes note of that \r\ndocument?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nagenda item 111?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 30\r\nReport of the Security Council\r\nReport of the Security Council (A/70/2)\r\nThe President: It is a pleasure to preside over \r\nthis important meeting of the General Assembly as it \r\nconsiders the annual report of the Security Council \r\n(A/70/2). The introduction to the report was prepared \r\nby New Zealand, as President of the Council in July, \r\nand is presented today by the current President for the \r\nmonth of November, Ambassador Rycroft of the United \r\nKingdom. According to the Charter of the United \r\nNations, the annual report of the Security Council shall \r\ninclude an account of the measures that the Council \r\nhas decided upon, or taken, to maintain international \r\npeace and security. As we look around the world today, \r\nit is clear that the Security Council plays a fundamental \r\nrole in the Organization as it seeks to prevent and end \r\nconflicts and tackle other threats to peace and security, \r\nincluding violent extremism.\r\nThe Council carries out its mandates on behalf \r\nof all Member States. Therefore, the Assembly’s \r\nconsideration of this report of the Council is an important \r\naspect of the transparency and accountability that the \r\nwider membership expects with regard to the Security \r\nCouncil. The annual report was among the many issues \r\ndiscussed when I addressed the Security Council open \r\ndebate on working methods last month (see S/PV.7539). \r\nWhile the report has improved in recent years, Member \r\nStates have also called for further improvements in its \r\nanalytical quality.\r\nHowever, the report is only one of the many \r\ninteractions between the Assembly and the Council, \r\nand such interaction will be particularly vital during \r\nthis year of joint activity. As Member States know, \r\nthe Presidents of the Security Council and General \r\nAssembly are tasked with bringing forward the process \r\nto select and appoint the next Secretary-General, \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.51\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n51st plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 12 November 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

The \r\nPresident of the Security Council and I have also been \r\nworking together on a peacebuilding review and the \r\nreappointment of co-facilitators in September to work \r\ntoward concurrent and identical General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions as the formal outcomes of \r\nthat process.\r\nI look forward to hearing Member States’ views \r\non this year’s annual report of the Council, as well as \r\nproposals on how best to make it a more useful tool \r\nfor the General Assembly’s consideration, as we look \r\nto continually improve the interaction between the \r\ndifferent organs of the United Nations.\r\nI now give the f loor to the President of the Security \r\nCouncil, Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, to introduce \r\nthe report of the Council.\r\nMr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): Let me begin by \r\ncongratulating you, Sir, on behalf of all the members \r\nof the Security Council, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session, and I \r\nthank you for arranging today’s meeting.\r\nAs the President of the Security Council for the \r\nmonth of November, it is my honour to introduce the \r\nannual report of the Council (A/70/2), which covers the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations entrusts the \r\nSecurity Council with the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nOver the past year, with the support of the United \r\nNations membership, the Security Council has sought \r\nto discharge its responsibilities actively, urging the \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts and undertaking a \r\nseries of peacekeeping and peacebuilding activities all \r\nover the world.\r\nIn keeping with recent trends, the activity of \r\nthe Security Council increased during the reporting \r\nperiod. During the period under review, the Council \r\nheld 267 formal meetings, of which 248 were public. \r\nThe Council adopted 65 resolutions and 27 presidential \r\nstatements and issued 148 statements to the press. The \r\nCouncil also conducted three missions, one to Europe \r\nand Africa, which included Belgium, the Netherlands, \r\nSouth Sudan, Somalia and Kenya, in August 2014; one \r\nto Haiti in January 2015, and one to Africa in March \r\n2015, which included the Central African Republic, \r\nBurundi and Ethiopia.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East featured \r\nprominently on the Council’s agenda. The Council \r\nfollowed the security situations in Iraq, the Syrian \r\nArab Republic and Yemen and adopted a number of \r\nresolutions. On Syria, the Security Council adopted \r\nresolution 2191 (2014), in which the Council renewed \r\ndecisions regarding the authorization of United \r\nNations agencies to deliver humanitarian aid across \r\nborders and the implementation of related monitoring \r\nmechanisms, and demanded that all parties to the \r\nSyrian domestic conflict comply with their obligations \r\nunder international humanitarian law and international \r\nhuman rights law. That resolution was followed by \r\nresolution 2209 (2015) concerning the use of toxic \r\nchemicals, such as chlorine, as a weapon in the Syrian \r\nArab Republic.\r\nOn Yemen, the Council adopted resolution 2201 \r\n(2015), which demanded that the Houthis withdraw \r\ntheir forces from Government institutions and engage \r\nin United Nations-brokered negotiations; resolution \r\n2204 (2015), which renewed the sanctions measures \r\nintroduced by resolution 2140 (2014), after the first \r\nthree individuals were listed in November; and \r\nresolution 2216 (2015), which listed an additional \r\ntwo individuals, Abdel-Malik al-Houthi and former \r\nPresident Ahmed Ali Abdullah Saleh, and introduced \r\nan arms embargo on the individuals designated under \r\nthe sanctions regime and those acting on their behalf or \r\nat their direction in Yemen.\r\nOther developments in the Middle East figured \r\nprominently on the Council’s agenda, including \r\nthe Palestinian question and the United Nations \r\nDisengagement Observer Force and Lebanon. The \r\nCouncil also adopted resolution 2231 (2015), endorsing \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on Iran, \r\nfollowing the diplomatic efforts by China, France, \r\nGermany, the Russian Federation, the United Kingdom, \r\nthe United States of America, the High Representative \r\nof the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security \r\nPolicy and the Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nThe Council also regularly considered the situation \r\nin Ukraine and adopted resolution 2202 (2015).\r\nMuch of the Council’s activity focused on Africa, \r\nincluding meetings on Burkina Faso, Burundi, the \r\nCentral African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, \r\nSomalia, the Sudan, South Sudan and Western Sahara. \r\nThe Council also responded to the Ebola outbreak with \r\nthe adoption of resolution 2177 (2014).\r\n15-36233 3/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nConcerning South Sudan, the Council also \r\nestablished a new subsidiary body, a Committee to \r\noversee a travel ban and asset freeze, pursuant to \r\nresolution 2206 (2015). The Committee subsequently \r\nimposed sanctions on six individuals.\r\nThematic, general and cross-cutting issues remained \r\na priority for the Council, including non-proliferation \r\nand the Committee established pursuant to resolution \r\n1540 (2004); threats to international peace and security \r\ncaused by terrorist acts; small arms and light weapons; \r\nthe protection of civilians in armed conflict; children \r\nand armed conflict; women and peace and security; \r\npeacekeeping and post-conflict peacebuilding; \r\nsecurity-sector reform; sanctions; cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and regional and subregional \r\norganizations; peace and security in Africa; and the \r\nrule of law.\r\nThe Council met regularly to address the threat posed \r\nby Al-Qaida, the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant \r\n(ISIL), the Al-Nusra Front, foreign terrorist fighters and \r\nthe spread of violent extremism. The Council adopted \r\nresolution 2170 (2014) to cut off funding for ISIL, \r\nthe Al-Nusra Front and all other individuals, groups, \r\nundertakings and entities associated with Al-Qaida, \r\nand resolution 2199 (2015) to further constrain their \r\nfinancing, including new measures on the trade in oil \r\nand oil products for their benefit, as well as the looting \r\nand smuggling of antiquities from Iraq and the Syrian \r\nArab Republic. In addition, the Council added 32 \r\nindividuals and five entities to the sanctions list of the \r\nAl-Qaida Sanctions Committee established pursuant to \r\nresolutions 1267 (1999) and 1989 (2011).\r\nThe Council also adopted resolution 2178 (2014), \r\naddressing the threat posed by foreign terrorist fighters \r\nand requiring States to establish criminal offences \r\nsufficient to enable the prosecution of specified \r\noffences and calling for States to enhance international \r\ncooperation in that regard; resolution 2178 (2014) also \r\naddressed the need to combat violent extremism as an \r\nessential element of combating the threat of foreign \r\nterrorist fighters. In addition, the Council strongly \r\ncondemned the escalation of attacks by Boko Haram, \r\nand expressed concern at the continuing threat posed \r\nby the group.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nfounding of the United Nations. The Council held an \r\nopen debate on maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity in February 2015 (S/PV.7389), reiterating its \r\nresponsibility to uphold the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. The Council held two \r\nopen debates on women and peace and security, one \r\nin October 2014 (see S/PV.7289) and the other in April \r\n2015 (see S/PV.7428), and, at a debate in May on the \r\nprotection of journalists (see S/PV.7450), the Council \r\nadopted the second-ever resolution on the subject in 10 \r\nyears, resolution 2222 (2015).\r\nIn November 2014, in another innovation for the \r\nCouncil, the Council was briefed, for the first time, \r\non the role of policing in peacekeeping and post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding, and adopted the Council’s first \r\nresolution dedicated to policing issues (resolution 2185 \r\n(2014)) to respond to the contemporary challenges of \r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nIn conclusion, consistent with usual practice, \r\nthe introduction to the report was prepared by New \r\nZealand, which held the presidency of the Security \r\nCouncil in July 2015. Members of the Council also \r\ncontributed to the preparation of the report. I extend \r\nthanks to the Secretariat for compiling the report and to \r\nall those involved in producing it. I look forward to this \r\nmorning’s discussion of the report by Member States \r\nand will convey the views of members of the General \r\nAssembly to my colleagues in the Security Council.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): On \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), allow \r\nme, at the outset, to express NAM’s appreciation to \r\nyou, Mr. President, for holding this debate, which will \r\nprovide the General Assembly with an opportunity \r\nto examine, scrutinize and evaluate the report on the \r\nactivities of the Security Council (A/70/2).\r\nThe provision in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nrequiring the Council to report to the General Assembly \r\nwas designed to help the Assembly, as the chief \r\ndeliberative and representative organ of the United \r\nNations, to exercise its mandate with regard to issues \r\nrelating to the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nMember States have conferred on the Security \r\nCouncil the primary responsibility for the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, pursuant to Article \r\n24, paragraph 1, of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIn that context, the Council acts on behalf of Member \r\nStates. That is why NAM stresses that the Council \r\nshould report and be accountable to the General \r\nAssembly, in accordance with paragraph 3 of Article \r\n24 of the Charter.\r\n4/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nNAM underscores the need for States Members of \r\nthe United Nations to fully respect the functions and \r\npowers of each principal organ of the United Nations, \r\nin particular the General Assembly, and to maintain \r\nthe balance among those organs within their respective \r\nCharter-based functions and powers. NAM also \r\nstresses that the Security Council must fully observe \r\nall provisions in the Charter, as well as all of the \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions that clarify the Council’s \r\nrelationship with the Assembly and other principal \r\norgans. In that context, we affirm that Article 24 of \r\nthe Charter does not necessarily provide the Security \r\nCouncil with the competence to address issues that \r\nfall within the functions and powers of the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council, \r\nincluding in the areas of norm-setting, legislation, \r\nadministrative and budgetary matters, and establishing \r\ndefinitions, bearing in mind that the Assembly is the \r\nbody primarily tasked with the progressive development \r\nof international law and its codification.\r\nNAM reiterates its concern about the continuing \r\nencroachment by the Security Council on the functions \r\nand powers of the General Assembly and the Economic \r\nand Social Council, which it does by addressing issues \r\nthat traditionally fall within the competence of those \r\norgans. NAM is also concerned over the attempts by \r\nthe Security Council to use thematic issues to expand \r\nits mandate into areas that do not pose a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security. NAM therefore \r\nurges the Council to confine itself to its mandate, \r\nin accordance with the provisions of the Charter. \r\nAll organs and bodies of the United Nations should \r\ncarry out only those tasks that are established in their \r\nrespective mandates.\r\nNAM urges all States to uphold the primacy of \r\nand full respect for the provisions of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations pertaining to the functions and powers of \r\nthe Assembly, and calls on the Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nSecurity Council to conduct regular discussions and \r\ncoordination among themselves regarding the agenda \r\nand programme of work of the respective principal \r\norgans that they represent. In doing so, they need to \r\nestablish increased coherence and complementarities \r\namong those organs in a mutually reinforcing manner \r\nand be respectful of each other’s mandates.\r\nNAM also welcomes, as a step forward, the informal \r\nmeetings held between the President of the Council \r\nfor July and States Members of the United Nations on \r\nthe preparation of the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil, and calls for more regular interactions, each \r\nyear, between the President of the Security Council \r\nfor July, when the report is prepared, and the wider \r\nmembership of the United Nations, which can help \r\nenhance the quality of such reports.\r\nFor years, the Non-Aligned Movement has noted \r\nthat the annual reports of the Security Council continue \r\nto be a procedural overview of the meetings, activities \r\nand decisions of the Council. We call on the Security \r\nCouncil to submit a more explanatory, comprehensive \r\nand analytical annual report to the General Assembly, \r\nassessing the work of the Council, including cases \r\nwhen the Council has failed to act, and the views \r\nexpressed by its members during the consideration of \r\nthe agenda items under its consideration. Furthermore, \r\nNAM calls on the Security Council to elaborate on \r\nthe circumstances under which it adopted particular \r\noutcomes, ranging from resolutions to presidential \r\nstatements, press statements and others.\r\nFinally, we call on the Security Council to submit \r\nspecial reports, when necessary, for the consideration \r\nof the General Assembly, pursuant to Article 15, \r\nparagraph 1, and Article 24, paragraph 3, of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. The Security Council should \r\nensure that its monthly assessments are comprehensive \r\nand analytical and issued in a timely fashion. The \r\nGeneral Assembly may consider proposing parameters \r\nfor the elaboration of such assessments.\r\nMr. Jürgenson (Estonia): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency (ACT) group, a cross-regional group \r\ncomprised of the following 25 small and mid-sized \r\ncountries working together to improve the working \r\nmethods of the Security Council: Austria, Chile, Costa \r\nRica, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Gabon, Ghana, \r\nHungary, Ireland, Jordan, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, \r\nMaldives, New Zealand, Norway, Papua New Guinea, \r\nPeru, Portugal, Rwanda, Saudi Arabia, Slovenia, \r\nSweden, Switzerland and Uruguay. Currently, three \r\nACT members are serving in the Council and in 2016 \r\nthe number will remain the same.\r\nLet me start by thanking the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for holding this debate and for his \r\ndedication to the issue, most notably seen in his strong \r\ncall for a more analytical report voiced in the open \r\ndebate on working methods (see S/PV. 7539) held in the \r\nCouncil this October.\r\n15-36233 5/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nThe ACT group expresses its appreciation to New \r\nZealand for its efforts and commitment in preparing the \r\nintroduction to the report (A/70/2), and to the United \r\nKingdom for its presentation. The report summarizes \r\npast activities conducted by the Council and signals \r\nits priority areas. In that regard, it is a clear and well-\r\norganized document. However, while recognizing the \r\nchallenge of keeping the document inclusive and yet \r\nconcise, we would have welcomed — as previously \r\nemphasized — a stronger focus on analysis. Adding \r\nadditional insights into the Council’s decision-making \r\nprocesses would help the General Assembly to better \r\ncapture the content of the report and the work of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nACT commends the efforts of the Security Council \r\nto enhance its transparency and effectiveness. In recent \r\nyears, the Council has interacted with a great number \r\nof outside actors — civil society, non-governmental \r\norganizations, academics and others — through various \r\ntypes of innovative meetings, including Arria-Formula \r\nmeetings and other informal interactive dialogues. \r\nThe overall number of open debates, public briefings, \r\nwrap-up sessions and reports to the General Assembly \r\nhas also increased. More f lexible use of the range of \r\nCouncil products, particularly press and presidential \r\nstatements, has been made in reaction to unfolding \r\nevents.\r\nThe ACT group fully appreciates the introductory \r\npart of the report, the five-page section on thematic \r\nissues and the fact that part II of the report includes an \r\noverview of 43 items and situations. However, in our \r\nview, there is still room for improvement by making it \r\nmore analytical. In doing so, both the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly could make better use of \r\nthe report, while fully respecting the tasks, mandates \r\nand competencies of the two bodies. To help with the \r\naforementioned, last year at the Assembly meeting on \r\nthe same issue, the ACT group offered six concrete \r\nsuggestions on how the annual report could be drafted, \r\nthe nature of its content and how to improve the \r\ndiscussion on it (see A/69/PV.58). As those proposals \r\nstill retain their relevance, please allow me to point \r\nthem out again.\r\nFirst, how relevant is the number of open debates \r\nheld, if the exchange of views and specific proposals \r\nare not included in the report? When assessing the \r\nimpact of consultations, the Council should explicitly \r\ninclude in the report a representative selection of \r\nthe views expressed by non-members. In doing so, \r\npreference should be given to group statements that \r\nfeature concrete suggestions.\r\nSecondly, the adoption of the annual report by the \r\nCouncil could be an occasion for a public debate with \r\nCouncil members. Issues addressed in that open debate \r\ncould include the decisions made by the Council and the \r\npositions of the various member States; challenges that \r\nthe Council faces in the execution of its mandate and \r\nhow it proposes to solve them; references to discussions \r\non which the Council did not find agreement; and the \r\nreasons that led the Security Council not to take firm \r\npositions on important issues related to peace and \r\ninternational security. ACT recommends that both \r\na retrospective and a prospective focus be taken into \r\naccount during such an analytical discussion of the \r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nThirdly, annual assessments of the work of the \r\nCouncil’s subsidiary bodies and monthly assessments \r\nby Council presidencies that provide more analytical \r\nmaterial than the current annual report should be \r\ncompiled and form an integral part of the annual \r\nreport. These assessments could play an important \r\nrole in guiding the priorities of the Council month by \r\nmonth. Any disclaimers related to the positions of other \r\nCouncil members could be included.\r\nFourthly, thematic issues are not stand-alone \r\ntopics; on the contrary, they are an integral part of \r\nthe consideration of country situations. Both general \r\nunderlying themes and cross-cutting issues that are \r\nrelevant through the work of the Security Council \r\nshould therefore, despite not being formally part of the \r\nagenda, be linked through relevant cross-references to \r\ncountry situation analyses. In this vein, we especially \r\nencourage more efforts by the Council to honour and \r\nengage other relevant United Nations stakeholders in \r\nall its thematic engagements.\r\nFifthly, the annual report could also be a useful tool \r\nfor accountability in the area of the working methods of \r\nthe Council. Elements of evaluation in relation to key \r\nareas of the Council’s work should be introduced. A \r\nsection of the report, therefore, should be dedicated to \r\nthis topic and include a record of the progress made in \r\nthe implementation of the presidential notes and other \r\nworking methods as recommended by other Member \r\nStates and ACT.\r\nLastly, the adoption of the annual report should be \r\nan excellent occasion not only to review and evaluate \r\nthe past, but also for all parties to take in lessons \r\n6/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nlearned and to discuss options and strategies for the \r\nfuture. Any discussion of the annual report should \r\nnot be mainly a retrospective formal exercise, but a \r\nprospective, reform-minded one. ACT suggests as a \r\npossible format a series of workshops clustered around \r\ncountry situations or larger thematic issues, or even in a \r\nless formal format than the Arria Formula setting.\r\nAllow me also to say a few words on other matters \r\nrelated to the working methods of the Council. We would \r\nlike to highlight the increase in the number of open \r\ndebates organized by each month’s Council President. \r\nAt the same time, we recall that they should also \r\ntranslate into meaningful discussions. We encourage \r\nmore spontaneous, lively and productive consultations \r\nwithin the Council.\r\nWe are gratified that 106 Member States, including \r\nnine members of the Security Council, have supported \r\nthe code of conduct regarding Security Council action \r\nagainst genocide, crimes against humanity and war \r\ncrimes. We encourage all States that have not yet done \r\nso, especially those seeking election to the Security \r\nCouncil, to sign up. Now is the time to implement \r\nthe commitments contained in the code of conduct by \r\ntaking more consistent action to prevent or end the \r\ncommission of atrocity crimes.\r\nAs we are in the important year before the selection \r\nof the next Secretary-General, the ACT group would \r\nhope to see enhanced cooperation between the \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil on this issue by their sending the joint letter as \r\nrequested in resolution 69/321 at the earliest.\r\nIn conclusion, let me stress that the ACT group \r\nwelcomes all proposals aiming to improve the content \r\nand submission of the annual report, and in this regard \r\nwe are looking forward to studying, among others, the \r\nRussian-Lithuanian proposal.\r\nFinally, we encourage future Security Council \r\npresidencies to strengthen efforts to enhance the report \r\nand make it a more useful tool for us all.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria): I should like at the \r\noutset sincerely to thank British Ambassador Matthew \r\nRycroft for his excellent presentation of the report of \r\nthe Security Council to the General Assembly (A/70/2).\r\nWhile renewing our commitment to and support for \r\nthe statement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nIran on behalf of the Non-Aligned Movement, I should \r\nlike to add the following comments.\r\nThe Assembly’s consideration of the Security \r\nCouncil’s report should not be a mere formality, in \r\nthat it should provide the General Assembly, the chief \r\ndeliberative body of the United Nations, with a valuable \r\nopportunity for an in-depth analysis of the Council’s \r\nactivities, as well as identify the measures that should \r\nbe taken to make the necessary improvements in its \r\nworking methods. It is also an opportune occasion for \r\nMember States to express their views on the way in \r\nwhich the Council conducts its duties.\r\nWe believe that this interaction is also in the interest \r\nof the Security Council, which would benefit from it, \r\nby considering and using the ideas and constructive and \r\ninnovative proposals that I am convinced will emerge \r\nfrom this debate. Moreover, as is its prerogative, and \r\naccording to the Charter, the Assembly could even take \r\nany action it considers appropriate at the end of this \r\ndebate.\r\nWith regard to the format of the report, we are \r\npleased that it now contains an analytical section \r\non the work of the Council aimed at responding to \r\nthe comments and criticisms made in that regard by \r\nMember States throughout the years in this forum. The \r\ndocument before us indeed contains elements that are of \r\ninterest to all Members of the United Nations. However, \r\nwe have to underline the fact that the report is still far \r\nfrom being the substantive document that Members \r\nof the United Nations need in order to allow them to \r\nassess the work of the Council. We hope to see in future \r\nthe analytical part of the report provide indicators of \r\nthe results of the Council’s work as well as a section \r\ndevoted to proposals and recommendations aimed at \r\nimproving its work.\r\nWith regard to the functioning of the Council, a \r\nsignificant number of Council members made efforts \r\nduring the period under consideration to improve both \r\nexchanges with all Members of the United Nations \r\nand the transparency of that body’s working methods. \r\nIn order to limit the secrecy in the Council’s work, \r\na concerted effort needs to be made to improve the \r\ndissemination of information on the activities of the \r\nCouncil and to hold more open briefings in order to \r\nallow non-members of the Council to benefit from the \r\ninformation provided by the Secretariat on various \r\nsituations and conflicts and to express their opinion on \r\nthe decisions taken.\r\nAlgeria continues to believe that it would be wise, \r\non a case-by-case basis, for the consultations preceding \r\nthose meetings to be open to the parties interested or \r\n15-36233 7/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\ninvolved in the question under consideration in order \r\nto obtain their views. That would allow the Security \r\nCouncil to have a better understanding of the subject \r\nunder consideration and to take its decisions with \r\nbetter background information at hand. We appreciate \r\nthe monthly holding of wrap-up meetings open to \r\nnon-members of the Council. We believe those meetings \r\nprovide opportunities to express views on issues of \r\ninterest in an analytical, systematic, open and candid \r\nway.\r\nWith regard to the substance of the report, it \r\nillustrates that during the period under consideration, the \r\nCouncil has not only reacted to threats to international \r\nand regional peace and security, but has sometimes \r\nalso taken direct action to address the large number \r\nof problems affecting the world. It has demonstrated \r\ndetermination and follow-up in dealing with certain \r\nissues. We believe that Security Council missions to \r\nareas in conflict are extremely important because they \r\ntackle the heart of the problem. Those missions have \r\na positive impact on local actors. We encourage this \r\ntype of initiative and actions and call for them to be \r\nformalized and expanded to other conflict areas.\r\nOn a less positive note, we regret the implicit \r\nendorsement by some Council members of Member \r\nStates that do not respect Council resolutions, which \r\ncertainly compromises the Council’s authority, and in \r\nthat regard, we regret the fact that certain important \r\nSecurity Council resolutions have not been followed by \r\naction. That state of affairs is often representative of a \r\ndefiance of and lack of concern for the credibility of the \r\nCouncil. It is that very credibility of the Council that is \r\nin question today. That credibility will be further eroded \r\nif the Council does not succeed in reversing that trend \r\nand in demonstrating to the entire world its capacity \r\nto shoulder its responsibilities in the management and \r\nsettlement of the disputes that have been on its agenda \r\nfor a very long time and to no avail.\r\nIn conclusion, I should highlight the importance of \r\nstrengthening and consolidating the cooperation among \r\nthe United Nations, the African Union and the African \r\nUnion Peace and the Security Council, because we \r\nmust spare no effort to equip the African Union with \r\nthe capacity and the peacebuilding architecture needed \r\nto ensure the success of its missions that have been \r\ndeployed on the basis of a Council mandate.\r\nMr. Mukerji (India): Let me, at the outset, thank \r\nthe President for organizing this meeting to consider \r\nthe annual report of the Security Council (A/70/2), \r\ncovering the period from 1 August 2014 to 31 July \r\n2015. I would like to express my appreciation for the \r\nefforts made by Ambassador Gerard van Bohemen, \r\nPermanent Representative of New Zealand, and his \r\nteam in preparing the annual report of the Council. I \r\nwould also like to thank Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, \r\nPermanent Representative of the United Kingdom, for \r\npresenting the report to the General Assembly.\r\nLast year, my delegation proposed that the issues \r\nraised by Member States in this annual meeting to \r\nconsider the Security Council’s report should be \r\nfollowed up, so that the Council can respond to this \r\ndebate. Several other delegations also made the same \r\nproposal. While paragraph 216 of the report before \r\nus today indicates that the President of the Council \r\nprovided Council members last year with a summary of \r\nthe Assembly’s consideration of the annual report, that \r\nseems to have been the end of the matter, as far as the \r\nCouncil is concerned.\r\nThe attitude of the Council in that regard is highly \r\nobjectionable. We expect the Council to take into account \r\nthe views expressed by us in this annual exercise. If \r\nthe Council feels that our views are not relevant, we \r\nexpect to be informed of the reasons why that is the \r\ncase. Otherwise, we are discussing the annual report \r\nof the Council without any reason, and the valuable \r\ntime and resources of the General Assembly are being \r\nwasted in the process. We note, in paragraph 1 of the \r\nreport, that the Council held 267 formal meetings, of \r\nwhich 248 were public. It also adopted 65 resolutions \r\nand 27 presidential statements.\r\nThe question that we pose today is in how many of \r\nthe open debates in which Member States participated \r\ndid the Council adopt its outcome documents — whether \r\nresolutions or presidential statements — after the \r\nparticipation of non-Council member States? The \r\nanswer is quite clear: none. All the resolutions and \r\npresidential statements were adopted by the Council at \r\nits open debates before Member States, not represented \r\nin the Council, took the f loor, making a travesty of \r\nsuch open participation. Of late, that attitude, directed \r\nat other Member States, has become even more \r\nworrying. At a recent open debate of the Council, we \r\nwere shocked to note that plenipotentiary accredited \r\nenvoys of Member States were given the opportunity to \r\nspeak only after non-plenipotentiary representatives of \r\nnon-Member State delegations.\r\n8/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nThe Council’s report gives impressive statistics, but \r\nthose statistics only cloak the Council’s imperviousness \r\nto adapting its working procedures to the contemporary \r\nworld, which would require it to meet the standards of \r\ntransparency and accountability and be responsive to \r\nthe views of other Member States. That is the nub of \r\nthe problem.\r\nThe Council’s report, being opaque and \r\nunaccountable, is therefore a halfway house. We read \r\nits 264 pages without really understanding why the \r\nprimary organ of the United Nations responsible for \r\nmaintaining international peace and security has \r\nallowed the world to slide further down the road to \r\nviolence and conflict. Why have more than 60 million \r\npeople become the victims of crises? Why is the world \r\nseeing so many refugees from crisis situations? We in \r\nthe General Assembly do not receive any answers to \r\nsuch questions, nor, for that matter, does the general \r\npublic. The consequence is a severe erosion of the \r\ncredibility of the Council itself.\r\nI would like to focus on three major areas of the \r\nCouncil’s work, as contained in its annual report, to \r\noffer some comments. I do so to highlight the fact \r\nthat the ineffectiveness of the Council imposes severe \r\ncosts on all of us, especially developing countries. \r\nJudging from its report, we must conclude that the \r\nCouncil seems unable to comprehend the nature of \r\nthe socioeconomic challenges faced by developing \r\ncountries resulting from the breakdown in international \r\npeace and security, especially now when we are on the \r\ncusp of implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), adopted unanimously, \r\nwith the goal of eradicating poverty within a generation. \r\nThat is due to the fact that, for the past 70 years, only \r\none developing country is represented as a permanent \r\nmember in the Council, while our total membership \r\nin the Assembly is more than 134. We call for the \r\nurgent expansion of the Council, in order to add more \r\ndeveloping-country members in both of its categories, \r\nso as to offset that problem. The three areas of the \r\nCouncil to which I refer are its implementation of United \r\nNations peacekeeping, the response of the Council to \r\nterrorism and the inability of the Council to discharge \r\nits primary task, enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, namely, to resolve disputes peacefully.\r\nWith regard to United Nations peacekeeping, the \r\nannual report states that much of the Council’s activity \r\nfocused on Africa. Yet none of the peacekeeping \r\nmissions mandated by the Council to operate in Africa \r\nhave been successfully completed. Going by its routine \r\nrollover of the mandates of peacekeeping operations, \r\nthe Council is using peacekeeping as an open-ended \r\nmechanism, not as a means to bring about a sustainable \r\npeace, as recommended most recently in the report of \r\nthe High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations \r\n(A/70/95). That brings into focus the fact that the \r\nCouncil has not been able to use peacekeeping as a \r\ntool to secure peace. For peacekeeping in general, the \r\nCouncil continues to f lout Article 44 of the Charter by \r\nnot inviting troop-contributing Member States that are \r\nnot represented in the Council to participate in decisions \r\non how mandates for peacekeeping are drawn up.\r\nWe call on the Council to immediately implement \r\nArticle 44 of the Charter, in its letter and spirit, so as to \r\nmake United Nations peacekeeping more effective and \r\ncost-efficient. As far as crises in Africa are concerned, \r\nthey are most probably due to the fact that none of \r\nthe permanent members of the Council, who exercise \r\nthe right of being the drafters of those mandates, or, \r\nas they call themselves, penholders, is from Africa. \r\nThat is a major shortcoming, as seen from the report \r\nof the Council, and one that can be rectified only by \r\nexpanding the membership of the Council, in both \r\ncategories. Mere increases in short- or, for that matter, \r\nlong-term rotational seats are not the answer, in the real \r\nworld, to the glaring shortcomings of penholdership.\r\nRegarding the second issue, the response of the \r\nCouncil to the threats posed by terrorism, especially in \r\nAfrica and Asia, has been less than robust. In paragraph \r\n49 of the report, the Council notes the growing terrorist \r\nthreat that affects the neighbouring countries of Libya \r\nand beyond. In paragraph 51, the Council calls for the \r\nterrorist threat to be addressed. The same pattern is \r\nevident in reading paragraphs 121 and 127, regarding \r\nSyria and Iraq. In addition to the landmark Council \r\nresolutions adopted earlier against terrorism, such \r\nas resolution 1267 (1999), resolution 1373 (2001) and \r\nresolution 1540 (2004), we note the reference in this \r\nreport to more recent resolutions, such as resolution 2195 \r\n(2014), resolution 2170 (2014), resolution 2178 (2014) \r\nand resolution 2199 (2015). Despite all its exhortations \r\nand resolutions, the report is silent on what the Council \r\nhas actually done in terms of acting to meet that threat. \r\nThe increasing number and brutality of terrorist acts, \r\nmeanwhile, vividly illustrates the ineffectiveness of the \r\nCouncil in countering terrorism.\r\nLast year, my delegation pointed to the need for \r\nthe Council to investigate, prosecute and penalize \r\n15-36233 9/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nterrorist acts, especially those directed against United \r\nNations personnel and peacekeepers. Regrettably, the \r\nCouncil has not acted on that issue, and paragraphs 134 \r\nto 140 of the report make for dismal reading regarding \r\nthe ineffectiveness of the Council in that regard. The \r\nreport does not reveal anything about the way in which \r\nthe Council’s sanctions regimes against terrorism have \r\nfunctioned, which, by itself, is a significant omission, \r\nhidden from our scrutiny in the Assembly.\r\nThe third area where the Council’s report glosses \r\nover the Council’s ineffectiveness is in the pursuit of \r\npeaceful negotiations to resolve disputes. For example, \r\nefforts to use political negotiations to resolve crises are \r\nnow occurring outside the Security Council, not in it. \r\nThe Council has watched such negotiations from the \r\nsidelines, whether they concern the crises in Syria, \r\nSouth Sudan or Ukraine. We note that the negotiations \r\nhave been conducted by Member States, not all of \r\nwhich are represented in the Council. That is a telling \r\ncomment on the fact that, today, the Council is not the \r\nprimary driver of resolving disputes through political \r\nprocesses, which is its core competence under the \r\nCharter. Such a trend again illustrates why, 10 years \r\nago, our leaders, in their wisdom, unanimously agreed \r\nthat the Council needed urgent reforms to make it more \r\nrepresentative in order for it to be more effective.\r\nAgainst that broad backdrop, we note with concern \r\nthe information in the report that the Council, rather than \r\nfocusing on its primary responsibility for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, is instead venturing \r\ninto areas that are in the domain of the General \r\nAssembly. Paragraphs 98 to 100 of the report illustrate \r\nthat trend clearly, especially when we recall that it was \r\nthe General Assembly that successfully galvanized the \r\ninternational response to the Ebola crisis through the \r\nEbola Trust Fund, to which my country was a major \r\nfinancial contributor.\r\nIn conclusion, the report illustrates vividly that, \r\ntoday, the Council’s effectiveness in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, the reason for which it \r\nwas set up by the Charter, has been severely undermined. \r\nThe solution, from our vantage points here in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, is to reform the Council as soon as \r\npossible, as was mandated by all our leaders at the 2005 \r\nWorld Summit. We are hopeful that our discussion \r\ntoday, Mr. President, will strengthen your resolve to \r\nimplement that mandate during your presidency, so \r\nthat we will be able to correct that major anomaly in \r\ninternational relations by the time we conclude the \r\ncommemoration of the seventieth anniversary of our \r\nUnited Nations in September 2016.\r\nMr. Mendoza-García (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Costa Rica aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Estonia on behalf \r\nof the Accountability, Consistency and Transparency \r\n(ACT) group.\r\nCosta Rica would like to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of the United Kingdom for his \r\npresentation of the annual report of the Security \r\nCouncil for the period from 1 August 2014 to 31 July \r\n2015 (A/70/2). The information it gives us about the \r\nCouncil’s huge and growing workload is in many \r\nways complete and useful. My delegation would also \r\nlike to thank New Zealand for its efforts in preparing \r\nthe report’s introduction. In that regard, we want to \r\nhighlight the significant work that has been done by the \r\nSecurity Council’s current non-permanent members, \r\nwho are responsible for much of the energy directed \r\nat ensuring the Council’s health, transparency and \r\naccountability.\r\nThe presentation of the Security Council’s annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly is an important occasion \r\nthat not only encourages accountability on the part of \r\nthe Council but also gives members of the Assembly \r\nan opportunity to address some of the most urgent and \r\ncompelling issues of the year in question. It is a year that \r\nhas seen a number of deteriorating situations, especially \r\nin Africa and the Middle East, and in which the \r\nSecurity Council has launched a number of prescriptive \r\ninitiatives on the protection of civilians — including \r\njournalists, women, girls and children — in armed \r\nconflict. It is a year in which the Council has also \r\ndisplayed dynamism in its response to new challenges, \r\nas it showed in its renewed determination to work more \r\nclosely with the United Nations system as a whole in \r\naddressing terrorism and sexual violence, to cite only \r\ntwo of its most significant efforts.\r\nCosta Rica appreciates the Council’s efforts each \r\nyear to improve its annual report and urges it to continue \r\nto improve its quality and comprehensiveness. In that \r\nregard, I would like to make some specific, respectful \r\nrecommendations that we hope can be put into practice \r\nin order to improve the report’s value, particularly \r\nto members of the Assembly in general. We urge \r\nthe Security Council to make its annual report more \r\nanalytical and thoughtful, which would be a welcome \r\nchange, because at present it is a statistical compilation \r\n10/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nof events and a bland summary of meetings and final \r\ndocuments.\r\nWe would be grateful if the Council could provide \r\nus with an analysis of its decision-making processes, \r\nespecially where viewpoints diverge and converge. \r\nWe would also like to see candid assessments of the \r\nobstacles to the prevention and resolution of conflicts, \r\nincluding some discussion of the circumstances in \r\nwhich the Council decided to adopt particular types of \r\ntexts, whether presidential statements or resolutions. \r\nThe hows, the whys and why nots are key for this type \r\nof report.\r\nThe adoption of the annual report should also be \r\nan opportunity for the Council to take note of lessons \r\nlearned, with the aim of discussing options and \r\nstrategies for improving its performance in future. In \r\nthat regard, we would like to emphasize how important \r\nit is to have higher levels of substantive participation by \r\nthe entire membership in the early stages of the drafting \r\nprocess. That can be done, for example, through open \r\ninteractive discussions or other informal formats, in \r\nwhich views can be exchanged between the first draft \r\nof the report and the Council’s final approval of it.\r\nAs the report says, the Security Council has held \r\na significant number of thematic debates, in which \r\nparticipation has been open to the Organization’s entire \r\nmembership. However, interactivity in those debates \r\nis virtually non-existent, and any resulting document \r\nis generally agreed on by the Council without taking \r\nMember States’ views into account. We must find a way \r\nto ensure that the discussions in which the membership \r\nparticipates have more impact on the Organization’s \r\npolicies.\r\nThe Security Council also plays a very important \r\nrole in the fight against impunity. Costa Rica urges \r\nthe Council to strengthen its cooperation with the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, especially where \r\natrocities are concerned, so as to empower the Court \r\nand enable it to fulfil its mandate, as well as to support \r\nthe Court in its investigations and prosecutions and thus \r\nensure accountability for perpetrators. In that regard, \r\nwe would like to reiterate our proposal for establishing a \r\nuniform, predictable and transparent protocol whereby \r\nthe Council can refer cases to the Court, while at the \r\nsame time ensuring that the Council does not insert \r\njurisdictional exceptions that could violate the principle \r\nof equality before the law and jeopardize the Court’s \r\ncredibility. Such measures would help to strengthen \r\nthe Court’s role, while safeguarding its independence. \r\nThe Court’s concerns about financing, security and \r\naccess all deserve the Council’s sustained attention if \r\nthe promise of the International Criminal Court is to \r\nbe fulfilled.\r\nBecause human lives are at stake, Costa Rica \r\nsupports the initiative of France and Mexico aimed at \r\nlimiting the use of the veto when mass atrocities are \r\ninvolved, a proposal that dates back to our membership \r\nin the “Little Five”. In particular, we support the \r\ncomplementary efforts led by Liechtenstein in the ACT \r\ngroup through the establishment of a code of conduct. \r\nCosta Rica is pleased that 106 States have joined that \r\ninitiative, and we encourage more Member States to \r\naccede to it, especially those seeking a seat on the \r\nSecurity Council. We would also like to reiterate our \r\ncall on the Council’s permanent members to keep \r\nan official record of their use or threat of use of the \r\nveto, along with their justification for its use, and to \r\nregularly circulate such information to all Members \r\nof the United Nations. We suggest that States take a \r\nState’s adherence to the code of conduct into account \r\nwhen deciding which States to support in elections to \r\nthe Security Council and the Human Rights Council.\r\nCosta Rica is proud to have been one of the first States \r\nto advocate for reforms in selecting and appointing the \r\nSecretary-General, who represents the entire United \r\nNations system. It is crucial to ensure that the General \r\nAssembly plays a proper part in the selection process. \r\nWe cannot stress enough how urgently we need to be \r\nable to rely on a democratic and transparent process, if \r\nwe are to ensure we can rely on our next leader — one \r\nwho Costa Rica hopes will be a woman — a leader able \r\nto inspire the complete confidence of the United Nations \r\nfamily. Resolution 69/321 calls on the Presidents of the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly to send a \r\njoint letter to all Member States to begin the process \r\nof requesting nominations. The letter should contain \r\na description of the entire process and should invite \r\nStates to submit nominations, particularly of women, \r\nin a timely manner.\r\nCosta Rica would particularly urge the United \r\nKingdom, as the current President of the Security \r\nCouncil for November, to launch a collaborative \r\nprocess together with you, Sir, as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, to begin implementing that historic \r\nresolution. Costa Rica views that process, along with \r\nconsideration of the Council’s report, as an excellent \r\nopportunity for strengthening the relationship between \r\n15-36233 11/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nthe two principal organs of the United Nations. All \r\nwe need now is political will and the initiative of our \r\nleaders.\r\nMr. Sobral Duarte (Brazil): Let me begin by \r\nthanking the Permanent Representative of the United \r\nKingdom and President of the Security Council for the \r\nmonth of November, Ambassador Matthew Rycroft, for \r\npresenting the annual report of the Security Council \r\n(A/70/2). I would also like to thank the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of New Zealand, Ambassador Gerard \r\nvan Bohemen, for preparing the introduction to the \r\nreport in his capacity as President of the Council in \r\nJuly.\r\nThe report under discussion today is an important \r\nelement in the overall effort to make the Council more \r\naccountable to the broader membership. Delegations \r\ndeserve to be better informed about the Council’s \r\ndeliberations. Brazil has been a long-standing supporter \r\nof measures to promote transparency and accountability \r\nfor the benefit of the 178 Member States that are not \r\npart of the Council’s daily routine.\r\nThere are three reports currently under consideration \r\nby the broader membership that provide us with relevant \r\ninputs for reflection on the strengths and shortcomings \r\nof our collective security mechanism. The emphasis on \r\nthe primacy of politics and on prevention proposed by \r\nthe High-level Independent Panel on Peace Operations, \r\nthe Advisory Group of Experts on the Review of the \r\nPeacebuilding Architecture and the authors of the \r\nGlobal Study on the implementation of resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) is a welcome development. Bearing in mind that, \r\nas the Council’s annual report highlights, the Security \r\nCouncil is facing increasingly complex threats with an \r\nalarming rise in the number of civilian victims, we must \r\nput conflict prevention at the forefront of our strategies.\r\nAmong the various tools at the disposal of the \r\nUnited Nations for promoting conflict prevention, \r\nthe role of the Peacebuilding Commission deserves \r\nto be highlighted. By fostering joint international \r\nstrategies on reconstruction, institution-building and \r\npolicy development in vulnerable environments, the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission has a key role to play in \r\naverting the recurrence of conflict and in promoting \r\na culture of prevention of conflicts. That proved to be \r\nparticularly true during last year’s Ebola crisis in West \r\nAfrica, when the Commission issued an early warning \r\nto the Security Council on the destabilizing regional \r\nimplications of the epidemic. It also contributed to \r\nraising awareness within the international community, \r\nthereby helping to prevent the public-health emergency \r\nfrom reversing the important peacebuilding gains that \r\nhad been achieved in that part of the world.\r\nOne of the highlights of the Council’s work during \r\nthe past year was the high-level review of the women \r\nand peace and security agenda, which culminated in a \r\nsuccessful open debate held last month (see S/PV.7533), \r\nwhen resolution 2242 (2015) was adopted. A number of \r\ncountries, including my own, presented new, specific \r\nmeasures to protect and empower women and girls \r\naffected by conflict. The debate was inspired by the \r\nGlobal Study on the implementation of resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) and its vital recommendations, not least of which \r\nis the imperative of avoiding the securitization and the \r\nmilitarization of the women and peace and security \r\nagenda.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East further deteriorated \r\nduring the period covered by the Council’s report, amid \r\nincreasing tensions and threats to international peace \r\nand security. In Syria, the conflict has entered its fifth \r\nyear. The spiral of violence and destruction continues \r\nto worsen, resulting in the shocking figures of more \r\nthan 250,000 people killed, almost 8 million internally \r\ndisplaced persons and more than 4 million refugees. The \r\nindiscriminate attacks against the civilian population, \r\nincluding the use of so-called barrel bombs, continue \r\nunabated. There are also persistent reports of chemical \r\nmaterials, such as chlorine, being used as a weapon.\r\nAgainst that tragic background, the Council’s \r\nrecurring inability to act decisively to achieve a peaceful \r\nsolution to the Syrian crisis is distressing. Despite the \r\ngeneral recognition that there is no military solution to \r\nthe conflict, we continue to see a disconnect between the \r\npriority that should be given to political initiatives and \r\nthe level of hostilities and military engagement on the \r\nground. Despite the adoption of important resolutions \r\nto address the humanitarian challenges and the use of \r\nchemical weapons in Syria, the Council has not truly \r\ndealt with crucial aspects of the conflict. It must act to \r\nprevent further militarization, stop the f low of weapons \r\nto all belligerent parties and move the political process \r\nforward.\r\nIn the same vein, we are once again witnessing \r\na severe upsurge in violence in Palestine and Israel. \r\nWhile the peace process between Israelis and \r\nPalestinians remains stalled, living conditions in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories have deteriorated and \r\n12/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nillegal actions and provocations have increased. Many \r\ndelegations, including that of Brazil, have repeatedly \r\ncalled on the Security Council to fully assume its \r\nresponsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand to actively support and steer the peace process \r\ntowards a two-State solution. Not only has the Security \r\nCouncil fallen short of engaging in the promotion of \r\na durable and peaceful solution to the conflict; it \r\nhas also repeatedly missed opportunities to meet its \r\nresponsibilities.\r\nLast December, the Council failed to act when \r\na draft resolution on the issue was brought to a vote. \r\nJust a few weeks ago, a draft presidential statement \r\nrequesting the Secretary-General to provide options \r\nfor a temporary international observer presence in \r\nJerusalem was presented, but so far no progress has been \r\nachieved. We were glad to hear that a non-permanent \r\nmember has proposed a new draft resolution with the \r\ngoal of relaunching substantive peace talks. We hope \r\nthat this time the Security Council will not stand still \r\non that issue, which is critical to the stability of the \r\nentire Middle East.\r\nThe situation in the Democratic Republic of \r\nCongo has remained a concern in 2015. Efforts to \r\ncounter certain armed groups have been hindered by \r\nthe partial suspension of military cooperation between \r\nthe Congolese armed forces and the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUSCO). The ongoing \r\nsecurity-sector reform in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, which is key to the sustainable withdrawal \r\nof MONUSCO, still faces considerable challenges and \r\nrequires international attention.\r\nBrazil stresses the need to develop and implement \r\ncomprehensive and sustainable strategies to overcome \r\nthe root causes of conflict in the eastern Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, including the promotion of \r\nsocioeconomic development and the extension of State \r\nauthority. South-South cooperation also has a role to \r\nplay in the process. In that regard, Brazil has worked \r\ntogether with the United Nations and civil-society \r\norganizations to provide assistance to victims of sexual \r\nviolence in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nWith regard to the situation in Haiti, Brazil \r\nwelcomes the ongoing progress achieved in recent years, \r\nwhich has allowed the United Nations Stabilization \r\nMission in Haiti (MINUSTAH) to downsize. However, \r\nthere are still reasons for concern with respect to \r\nsecurity, including in the context of the ongoing \r\nelectoral process. In this sense, it is important that any \r\nassessment mission be deployed after the formation of \r\na new Government and that the reconfiguration process \r\nbe guided solely by conditions on the ground, as well \r\nas by the need to preserve the progress made in the past \r\n11 years.\r\nBrazil also underlines the importance of the tools \r\nmandated to MINUSTAH to develop quick-impact and \r\ncommunity violence reduction projects. The experience \r\nof Haiti has clearly shown that such activities directly \r\nbenefit the local population and assist in building \r\nconfidence in the peace process and the Mission \r\nthroughout its life cycle. Any future presence of \r\nthe Organization in Haiti should take that success \r\nstory into account and ensure the continuity of such \r\nactivities, so as to contribute to the sustainability of the \r\nreconstruction efforts.\r\nMr. González Franco (Paraguay), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nAs a concluding remark, let me emphasize how \r\nencouraged Brazil was by the significant participation \r\nin the General Assembly debate on Security Council \r\nreform held a few days ago (see A/70/PV.43). As we \r\nreiterated on that occasion, the only way to ensure a \r\nmore efficient, transparent and accountable Security \r\nCouncil is through comprehensive reform that adapts \r\nthe Council’s anachronistic structure to contemporary \r\ninternational realities. Brazil is confident that, under \r\nthe leadership of the President of the General Assembly, \r\nwe will be able to make substantive progress during the \r\nseventieth session.\r\nMr. Mwinyi (Tanzania): My delegation would \r\nlike to thank the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor convening this important meeting to consider the \r\nannual report of the Security Council (A/70/2), in line \r\nwith paragraph 3 of Article 24 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAs underscored in our statement made during the \r\ndebate on the revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly (see A/70/PV.45), we deem the continued \r\ninteraction between the Assembly and other principal \r\norgans of the United Nations to be absolutely critical \r\nto advancing their respective Charter mandates. It is \r\nin that regard that we wish to thank the President of \r\nthe Security Council for his excellent presentation of \r\nthe annual report, and New Zealand for its preparation. \r\nWe also wish to fully endorse and align ourselves with \r\n15-36233 13/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nthe statement delivered by the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nTanzania recognizes the central role being played \r\nby the Security Council in discharging its primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. We are aware that it does so not \r\non its own behalf, but on behalf of each and every \r\nState Member of the Organization. For that reason, \r\nwe are genuinely proud of the progress achieved over \r\nthe course of the 70 years of its existence. Similarly, \r\nwe are gravely concerned about the failures we have \r\nmet, the consequences of which must serve as lessons \r\nif we are to preserve the credibility and legitimacy of \r\nthe Organization. In other words, we must embrace \r\nand advance the comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil with a view to making it more effective, \r\ninclusive and reflective of contemporary global realities. \r\nWe believe that Member States are at a decisive moment \r\nwith the setting in motion of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations towards text-based negotiations. Let us \r\nforge ahead with greater zeal and determination to \r\nachieve that important objective as soon as possible.\r\nIn the meantime, we welcome measures being \r\ntaken to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of \r\nthe Security Council. These include the open debates, \r\nwhich Tanzania has been attending in order to share \r\nits perspectives. We hope that in future the Council \r\nwill arrange the debates in a way that would allow its \r\nmembers to take into account the views expressed by \r\ndelegations before adopting its outcomes. Initiatives \r\nproposed by France, Mexico and the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group, aimed at limiting \r\nthe use of veto in cases of atrocity crimes, are a step \r\nin the right direction. Whereas the code of conduct \r\nis justifiable, albeit not in a way that undermines its \r\nvalidity in line with the Charter, the bottom line is \r\nfor the members of the Council, especially those with \r\nveto-wielding power, to act in accordance and only \r\nin accordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nWe call on the Council to include, in its future \r\nreports to the Assembly, an assessment of its actions \r\nand inactions, including due to the use of the veto, as \r\nwell as the attendant repercussions thereof. It has been \r\nemphasized repeatedly, including by my delegation, \r\nthat the Council’s annual report should be analytical \r\nand incisive. As a matter of fact, there have been many \r\nrecommendations from the Chamber to the Council \r\nthrough its President, including those incorporated in \r\nthe letter of the President of the General Assembly at \r\nits sixty-ninth session, dated 4 December 2014. My \r\ndelegation is unaware of any feedback from the Council \r\nin that regard. We therefore request a follow-up to \r\nthe letter and the proposals contained therein by the \r\nPresident of the Assembly at the current session.\r\nWe welcome the Council’s increased interaction \r\nwith external actors, including representatives of civil \r\nsociety, academia and others to discuss a wide range of \r\ntopics. We note with regret, however, that in the recent \r\npast some of those meetings have covered divisive \r\ntopics that have nothing to do with the Council’s \r\nmandate. We wish to recall that, as a representative \r\nbody with a mandate distinct from that of the General \r\nAssembly, the Council must refrain from entertaining \r\nsuch topics, which only serve to derail it from its core \r\nresponsibility.\r\nWe note that the nature and scope of situations \r\nbeing addressed by the Security Council have evolved. \r\nConflicts have become complex, fragmented and \r\nintractable, and increasingly involve non-State armed \r\ngroups that employ unconventional and gruesome \r\nmethods of warfare. United Nations peace operations \r\nare also operating in perilous environments with little \r\nor no peace to keep. It is imperative, therefore, that the \r\nCouncil adapt accordingly. It must use all the tools at \r\nits disposal in discharging its Charter mandates. It must \r\ngive ample prominence to political solutions and invest \r\nin conflict prevention and post-conflict peacebuilding. \r\nIt must also forge stronger ties with regional and \r\nsubregional organizations so as to support them, as \r\nappropriate, in their endeavours towards conflict \r\nprevention and resolution. Finally, it must strengthen \r\ncooperation with other principal organs whose role \r\nin addressing some of the root causes of conflicts, \r\nincluding poverty and chronic inequality, is vital.\r\nIn conclusion, we wish to underscore the importance \r\nof upholding the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations; of fostering friendly relations \r\nand cooperation among States, in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations; and of strengthening \r\ncooperation among the principal organs of the United \r\nNations and between the organs and regional and \r\nsubregional organizations, while respecting their \r\nrespective mandates.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Liechtenstein \r\nis a member of the Accountability, Coherence and \r\n14/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nTransparency group and aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Estonia. \r\nOur comments today are being made against the \r\nbackground of the launch, three weeks ago, of the code \r\nof conduct regarding Security Council action against \r\ngenocide, war crimes and crimes against humanity. \r\nIn signing onto the code, 106 States have pledged to \r\nsupport timely Security Council action to prevent or \r\nend atrocity crimes and, specifically, not to vote against \r\ncredible draft resolutions to that end. We hope that \r\nsuch commitment, which was also made by nine of the \r\ncurrent members of the Security Council, will lead to \r\nan improvement in the Security Council’s track record \r\nin that respect. We have reviewed the annual report \r\n(A/70/2) with that in mind and would like to make some \r\ncomments on the Council’s action in that regard.\r\nThe Council’s sustained engagement in the \r\nsituation in Burundi during the reporting period was \r\ncommendable and necessary. Indeed, the Council’s \r\nvisit to the country in March seems to have been \r\nwell timed. Nevertheless, the Council was not able to \r\naddress the violence that accompanied the elections \r\nand the chaotic circumstances surrounding them. \r\nMeeting regularly and issuing a press statement did \r\nnot prove to be an adequate response to a crisis that \r\nled 144,000 Burundians to f lee their country during \r\nthe reporting period alone. The inability to engage \r\nin effective preventive diplomacy has resulted in the \r\npresent situation, on which the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, the Special Adviser \r\nfor the Prevention of Genocide and the Prosecutor of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), among others, \r\nhave commented and expressed their deepest concern. \r\nThe Council is challenged to act with resolve to address \r\nan explosive situation that could serve as a test of \r\nthe practical application of the code of conduct. We \r\ntherefore welcome the fact that the Security Council \r\nhas scheduled action on a draft resolution later today. \r\nThe Council engagement in Darfur is long-standing \r\nand yet, despite the presence of one of the largest \r\npeacekeeping operations in the history of the United \r\nNations, targeted sanctions and the referral of the \r\nsituation to the International Criminal Court, the conflict \r\ncontinues, as do serious violations of international \r\nhuman rights law and international humanitarian \r\nlaw. During the reporting period, the Council was \r\nconfronted by reports of mass rape by members of the \r\nSudanese armed forces in Thabit, Northern Darfur. No \r\nproper investigation was commissioned, the African \r\nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur was \r\nrepeatedly denied access and the Sudanese Government \r\neven demanded its eventual withdrawal. The Council \r\nhas not applied sanctions against any of the persons \r\nindicted by the ICC or made any new listings in the \r\nlight of new atrocity crimes. At the same time, the \r\nGovernment has continued its policy of non-cooperation \r\nwith the ICC, to which the Council referred the situation \r\n10 years ago, without any response from the Council. \r\nOver time, all this has fostered a climate of impunity \r\nin which the commission of atrocity crimes is only a \r\nlogical consequence. We share the frustration of the \r\nProsecutor of the ICC, who has decided — despite the \r\ncontinued commission of crimes that demand urgent \r\nattention — to direct her limited resources elsewhere \r\nin the face of Council inaction.\r\nIn Syria, too, the Council has not been able to \r\nadequately respond to what has become the defining \r\nconflict of the decade. It adopted two resolutions \r\nduring the reporting period. Resolution 2191 (2014), \r\non the humanitarian situation, demanded, among other \r\nthings, that\r\n“all parties to the ... conflict comply with their \r\nobligations under international humanitarian law \r\nand international human rights law” (Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2191 (2014), para. 1).\r\nThe resolution continues to be manifestly breached \r\ndaily, and yet the Council is unable to respond. \r\nResolution 2209 (2015) addresses the issue of \r\nchemical weapons, which, to be sure, constitutes one of \r\nthe more morbid aspects of the conflict in Syria. And yet \r\nthe Council’s one-sided focus on the chemical-weapons \r\ntrack is, at best, missing the larger point in a conflict \r\nthat has killed more than 250,000 people. At worst, \r\nit gives the impression that mass killings of civilians \r\nperpetrated by other means, including torture, \r\nstarvation and barrel bombs, deserve less attention \r\nthan the use of weaponry prohibited under international \r\nlaw. On the humanitarian track, the Council has taken \r\ncommendable steps, but implementation continues \r\nto be an enormous challenge, of which the ongoing \r\nlarge-scale displacement of the civilian population is \r\nbut the most obvious manifestation. Conspicuous by \r\ntheir absence from the report are references to any \r\nattempt to provide justice to the victims, establish \r\na credible accountability mechanism and provide \r\neffective protection to the civilian population.\r\nWe acknowledge the efforts of some members of \r\nthe Council to move the Council to do the right thing in \r\n15-36233 15/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\neach of these situations. There is, however, no way to \r\navoid the conclusion that the Council has been largely \r\nunable to take adequate action to prevent or end the \r\ncommission of atrocity crimes in spite of the varied \r\nand impactful toolkit at its disposal. While it has used \r\nthat toolkit most creatively in some situations — for \r\nexample, when chemical weapons were being used \r\nin Syria, or to develop world-wide anti-terrorism \r\nsanctions — it has been unable to do what is required \r\nin many situations involving atrocity crimes. We \r\nare concerned in particular because the Council’s \r\nperformance is key to the overall perception of the \r\nUnited Nations; an inability or unwillingness to act in \r\nthe face of atrocity crimes is especially harmful for the \r\nOrganization as a whole.\r\nWe expect the Council to be responsive to the \r\ndemands of the membership as a whole and to conduct \r\nits work in a culture of political accountability. By \r\nsupporting the code of conduct, 106 States have made it \r\nclear that they expect zero tolerance for atrocity crimes. \r\nThe Council members that have signed the code of \r\nconduct have a special responsibility in that respect, but \r\nwe hope that the Council as a whole will be responsive \r\nto the call for a change in culture. We look forward to \r\nreading about the start of such a change in next year’s \r\nreport.\r\nMrs. Del Sol Dominguez (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Cuba supports the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nOur delegation thanks the President for convening \r\ntoday’s meeting to consider the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly, contained in \r\ndocument A/70/2. Unfortunately, the Assembly meets \r\nevery year to discuss similar reports of the Security \r\nCouncil, which have not contained and still do not \r\ncontain any real critical analysis of the work done by \r\nthe Council. Once again, the report merely describes \r\nthe action taken by that organ.\r\nArticles 15 and 24 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations state that the Security Council shall submit \r\nannual and special reports on its work. Unfortunately, \r\nspecial reports are still not being submitted. The annual \r\nreport this year once again takes only a descriptive \r\napproach, listing the issues considered by the Council \r\nwithout any assessment thereof. Such an assessment \r\nwould have enabled Member States to themselves carry \r\nout a real assessment of the causes and implications \r\nof the actions undertaken by the Council in each \r\ncase, and also of its non-action in cases where there \r\nwas consideration of an issue representing a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThis exercise fails to provide true accountability \r\nof the Security Council to the General Assembly. How \r\nlong will we continue with this purely formal exercise? \r\nWhy are our repeated calls for change not heeded? Who \r\nbenefits from continuing this formal exercise, with no \r\nreal accountability to the most important organ of the \r\nUnited Nations?\r\nCuba reiterates its concern at the growing \r\ntendency in the Security Council to consider issues \r\nand assume functions that are not within its purview, \r\nthereby usurping the role entrusted by the Charter to \r\nother organs, particularly the General Assembly. We \r\nstress the need to strike the right balance between the \r\nprincipal organs of the United Nations, in accordance \r\nwith the Charter.\r\nWe once again urge Council members to review the \r\nCouncil’s agenda and adapt it to its mandated functions. \r\nThe Council must strictly abide by the provisions of the \r\nCharter and all resolutions of the General Assembly, \r\nwhich is the principal deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative organ of the United Nations.\r\nOne of the main problems and challenges still \r\nfacing the United Nations on its seventieth anniversary \r\nis its inability to carry out the reform the Security \r\nCouncil needs to make it into a truly transparent, \r\nrepresentative, democratic and effective body. Until the \r\nSecurity Council is thoroughly reformed, any reform of \r\nthe United Nations itself will remain incomplete.\r\nCuba calls on all Member States to work urgently \r\nto ensure that the closed-door consultations in the \r\nSecurity Council are the exception to the rule; that \r\nthere is an increase in both categories of membership, \r\npermanent and non-permanent, in order to remedy the \r\nunderrepresentation of developing countries in the \r\nCouncil, using no selective or discriminatory criteria; \r\nand that an end is put to the obsolete and anti-democratic \r\nveto.\r\nUrgent changes are required in the working methods \r\nof the Council so as to enable genuine participation \r\nby all Member States in its work and decisions. This \r\nincludes formalizing its rules of procedure, which, \r\n70 years on, remain provisional, so as to help to increase \r\ntransparency and accountability.\r\n16/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nTruly analytical annual reports on the work of the \r\nSecurity Council, and special reports, as provided for in \r\nthe Charter, are essential if the Assembly is to be able \r\nto discharge its mandate of maintaining international \r\npeace and security. We believe that a more transparent \r\nCouncil would be a more legitimate Council. A more \r\ninclusive and accessible Security Council that truly \r\ntakes into account the views of States Members of the \r\nOrganization would be a much more effective Council.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank the Permanent Representative of the \r\nUnited Kingdom for presenting the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council (A/70/2). I would also like to thank \r\nthe Permanent Representative of New Zealand for \r\nhaving prepared the report’s introduction.\r\nEgypt aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement and would also like to \r\nmake the following additional remarks.\r\nFirst, the Charter of the United Nations entrusts the \r\nSecurity Council with the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, on \r\nbehalf of the entire membership. Egypt therefore firmly \r\nbelieves that the work of the Security Council should \r\nbe based on transparency, inclusivity and openness. \r\nWe call for increased interactivity between the Council \r\nand the broader membership throughout the reporting \r\ncycle.\r\nSecondly, the report appears to be more of a \r\nstatistical compilation of the outcomes of the Council’s \r\nwork. Future reports need to be analytical rather than \r\ndescriptive and provide a deeper understanding of the \r\nstumbling blocks that faced the Council on specific \r\nissues.\r\nThirdly, we note the growing tendency of the \r\nCouncil to hold thematic debates on issues that do not \r\nconstitute imminent threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. These debates often encroach on the territory \r\nof other organs of the United Nations and overlap with \r\ntheir work. In this regard, we underscore the role of \r\nthe General Assembly in norm-setting, legislation and \r\nadministrative and financial issues, and we urge the \r\nCouncil to maintain the balance between the various \r\norgans of the United Nations as reflected in the United \r\nNations Charter.\r\nWe also urge the Security Council to hold regular \r\nconsultations with relevant States that are non-members \r\nof the Council. Such consultations should include the \r\nactive participation of non-member States relevant to \r\nthe issue at hand. In this regard, it is crucial to actively \r\nengage regional stakeholders in Council deliberations \r\non a crisis before considering taking action on it. \r\nMoreover, troop-contributing countries should also be \r\nengaged in the Council’s discussions of a peacekeeping \r\nmandate prior to its adoption.\r\nFinally, Egypt welcomes the continuous debate on \r\nthe Council’s working methods and will continue, during \r\nits coming membership in the Security Council for \r\n2016-2017, to contribute to strengthening transparency, \r\ninclusivity, openness and the democratization of the \r\nSecurity Council’s work, as it is indispensable to the \r\ncredibility of the Council in carrying out its mandate \r\nand ensuring its effectiveness and ability to address the \r\ngrowing challenges.\r\nMr. Alday González (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico would like to thank President Lykketoft for \r\nconvening this meeting. We also thank New Zealand \r\nfor having prepared the annual report (A/70/2) this \r\nyear and the United Kingdom for introducing it to the \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Charter states that the Council should carry \r\nout its work on behalf of the membership. Given the \r\nabsence of any other opportunities, this debate should \r\nin principle be the best possible opportunity to further \r\nstrengthen dialogue and communication on the work \r\nof the Council and the perception of the Council by \r\nMember States.\r\nHowever, neither the format nor the content of \r\nthe report, nor the way in which this debate is being \r\nheld, is truly conducive to a truly substantive or \r\ninteractive dialogue. We acknowledge the limitations \r\nof this exercise and the difficulties faced by Council \r\nmembers in reaching agreement on the content of, and \r\nadopting, the report, but we believe that there could \r\nbe an improvement if changes in working methods are \r\nincorporated.\r\nThe proposals that have been made for years by \r\nthe members of the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency group and its predecessor, the “Little \r\nFive” group, are, in the view of my delegation, viable \r\noptions for making the report’s content more useful \r\nto the membership and strengthening the dialogue \r\nbetween the Council and the other Members of our \r\nOrganization.\r\n15-36233 17/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nIn its current format, the report of the Security \r\nCouncil remains devoid of any analysis or high-quality \r\ninformation. We believe, for example, that were it to \r\ndiscuss, in a factual manner, occasions on which the \r\nCouncil was not able to reach agreement, this would \r\nprovide the membership with a more accurate and \r\nappropriate record of its deliberations. Giving equal \r\nweight to the views expressed by all members in those \r\ncases would, without prejudice, improve both the quality \r\nof the report and the transparency and accountability, \r\nthe lack of which impacts the work and decisions of the \r\nSecurity Council, to the detriment of its credibility. The \r\nconvening of an increasing number of briefings, open \r\ndebates and interactive dialogues would be an important \r\nstep towards realizing transparency and effectiveness \r\nin the Council’s work. We therefore propose that the \r\nSecurity Council hold, at least once a year, an open \r\ndebate accessible to all Member States to discuss the \r\ncontent of its annual report prior to its adoption, so \r\nthat the final product submitted to the Assembly would \r\nincorporate the views of non-members of the Council.\r\nOn the question of the powers of the Council, my \r\ndelegation reiterates that the Council should act in \r\naccordance with its mandate under the Charter, and \r\navoid the temptation to expand into areas that are not \r\nwithin its purview but fall clearly within that of the \r\nGeneral Assembly or the Economic and Social Council. \r\nOn the substance of the Council’s work, we welcome \r\nits overall sustained attention to a growing number of \r\nconflicts around the world, ranging from the Central \r\nAfrican Republic to the Middle East and from the Great \r\nLakes region of Africa to Haiti, among others. We are \r\nconcerned, however, that the dysfunctionality of the \r\nCouncil, when it cannot or will not act, exacerbates its \r\nchronic inability to fulfil its mandate, thereby making \r\nits failure to act an additional threat to peace and \r\ninternational security.\r\nThe work of the Security Council must not only \r\nbe balanced, objective and impartial, it must also be \r\nperceived as such by Member States and our citizens \r\naround the world. Along with other Member States, \r\nMexico is discussing and will discuss in the coming \r\nmonths a number of practical recommendations to build \r\non efforts and proposals that are already on the table, \r\nto be presented in due course for the membership’s \r\nconsideration.\r\nIn that vein, we have been encouraged by the broad \r\ntacit support that the membership has enthusiastically \r\ngiven to the French-Mexican initiative to limit the use \r\nof the veto and to the complementary proposal that has \r\nbeen launched with equal success by the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency group. Both initiatives \r\nsend a clear and strong message to the Security Council \r\nand constitute irrefutable evidence that most Member \r\nStates want the Council to change its working methods.\r\nMr. Jinga (Romania): Romania welcomes the \r\nadoption on 20 October of the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/70/2), covering its activities for the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015. We congratulate \r\nNew Zealand on preparing a comprehensive document, \r\nbased on a revised approach, in order to provide an \r\naccessible summary of the Council’s activities. We also \r\nappreciate the introduction of the report by the United \r\nKingdom presidency of the Council.\r\nAmbassador Gerard van Bohemen has said that \r\nhe “would have preferred a document that contained \r\nmore self-reflection on the Council’s performance” \r\n(S/PV.7538, p. 2). In fact, I think that the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of New Zealand did a great job and, in \r\nthat respect, I suggest that we take a 70-year look back \r\nat the first such report, of 3 October 1946:\r\n“The first twenty-three meetings of the Council \r\nwere held in London and the remainder in New \r\nYork ... Up to 15 July 1946, the Council had \r\nheld fifty meetings ... In fulfilling its primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, the Council has dealt with ... \r\n[five] questions.” (A/93, p. viii)\r\nOne may argue that at that time, we were dealing with \r\nother realities, different from those of today. Indeed, \r\naccording to the latest report,\r\n“During the period under review, the Council held \r\n267 formal meetings, of which 248 were public. The \r\nCouncil adopted 65 resolutions and 27 presidential \r\nstatements and issued 148 statements to the press” \r\n(A/70/2, p. 10).\r\nMoreover, we just heard that there are currently 66 \r\nmatters relative to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security that are being dealt with by the \r\nCouncil.\r\nRomania is of the view that not only has the quantity \r\nof the Council’s workload significantly increased; so \r\nhas its complexity. In that respect, I would like to refer \r\nto three particular aspects. First, let me recall that on \r\n16 October, we marked the 10-year anniversary of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1631 (2005), on cooperation \r\n18/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nbetween the United Nations and regional organizations \r\nin maintaining international peace and security. The \r\ntheme represented a priority of Romania’s 2004-2005 \r\nmandate in its role as a non-permanent member of the \r\nCouncil. Through that resolution, my country made \r\na conceptual and practical contribution to the United \r\nNations efforts in maintaining international peace \r\nand security, in accordance with the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nDevelopments at the international level, including \r\ncrisis situations that emerged in the aftermath of its \r\nadoption, confirmed the viability of our initiative. \r\nRegional organizations have become increasingly \r\nprofiled as privileged partners of the United Nations \r\nin maintaining international peace and security. To \r\ngive but two examples, I will cite the African Union \r\nand the Organization for Security and Cooperation in \r\nEurope. As a member of the European Union (EU), \r\nRomania also welcomes the enhanced cooperation \r\nbetween the EU and the United Nations, and reaffirms \r\nits willingness to further strengthen that process.\r\nSecondly, we are pleased to note the increased \r\npresence of the members of the Security Council on \r\nthe ground, as was the case with the three missions \r\nit undertook to Europe and Africa in August 2014, to \r\nHaiti in January 2015 and again to Africa in March \r\n2015. We hope that this approach will be maintained \r\nbecause we consider it critical for Council members to \r\ninteract directly with people affected by the conflicts \r\nthat the Security Council takes action on.\r\nLastly, I would like to underscore the efficiency of \r\nUnited Nations activities by referring to the decisions \r\nto reduce the overall force levels of the Missions in \r\nHaiti and Liberia, as a result of their positive outcomes. \r\nAt the same time, I think it is worth underlining the \r\ncapacity of the Security Council to adapt and respond \r\nappropriately to new types of crises, as was the case \r\nwith the first United Nations emergency health mission \r\nin Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea and with its \r\nleadership role in combating Ebola.\r\nThe report of the Security Council for the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2014 to 31 July 2015 is more than a \r\nfactual document. It is a mirror of its activities. We all \r\nneed a Security Council that is involved, committed, \r\ntransparent and efficient in its work.\r\nAllow me to conclude by extending our deep \r\nappreciation for their contributions as former \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council to Argentina, \r\nAustralia, Luxembourg, the Republic of Korea \r\nand Rwanda, and to the outgoing members Chad, \r\nChile, Jordan, Lithuania and Nigeria. I also take this \r\nopportunity to wish a most successful mandate to \r\nincoming non-permanent members Egypt, Japan, \r\nSenegal, Ukraine and Uruguay.\r\nMr. Mamabolo (South Africa): South Africa joins \r\nothers in thanking the President for scheduling this \r\ndebate on the annual report of the Security Council \r\n(A/70/2) and for linking our discussion to Article 12 \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. We also thank \r\nthe Permanent Representative of the United Kingdom, \r\nAmbassador Matthew Rycroft, President of the Security \r\nCouncil for the month of November, for introducing the \r\nreport, as well as the Permanent Representative of New \r\nZealand, Ambassador Gerard van Bohemen, and his \r\nteam for preparing the report.\r\nWhile the report before us indeed provides a useful \r\nfactual account of the work of the Security Council, \r\nSouth Africa is once again disappointed that it does \r\nnot provide an analytical evaluation of the Council’s \r\nwork, in particular with respect to its effectiveness in \r\ndischarging its mandate, namely, the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The Council’s annual \r\nreports remain too clinical, merely conveying events \r\nin a chronological, descriptive manner, with almost no \r\nanalysis. We believe that a more analytical report would \r\nbe beneficial to the broader membership, because it \r\nwould likely provide better insight into the challenges \r\nthat the Council faces as it deliberates on the various \r\nsituations on its agenda, as reflected in its ability to \r\nresolve certain conflicts.\r\nFurthermore, the report makes clear that very little \r\nhas changed for the elected members of the Security \r\nCouncil, who constantly face numerous challenges that \r\nresult from the high-handed tactics of the permanent \r\nmembers of the Council. South Africa has also long been \r\ncritical of the practice of having important resolutions \r\ndrafted by a small group that often consists of countries \r\nthat do not serve on the Security Council. Such texts \r\nare then presented to members of the Council as faits \r\naccomplis. While we support broad consultation by the \r\nCouncil, its decisions should be open to debate among \r\nall members of the Council.\r\nAs we stated in the recent debate of the Security \r\nCouncil on its working methods (see S/PV.7539), South \r\nAfrica is pleased with the Council’s commitment \r\nto enhanced strategic cooperation with the African \r\n15-36233 19/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nUnion Peace and Security Council. That is particularly \r\nrelevant in the context of the Secretary-General’s \r\nmost recent report on the future of United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, in which he identifies the \r\nneed for institutional cooperation and global-regional \r\npartnerships “so as to enable consultation, common \r\nearly warning and conflict analysis, and coordinated \r\nresponses to the specific dynamics of each region” \r\n(A/70/357, para. 46). More specifically with regard \r\nto the African Union, South Africa supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s call to “institutionalize consultative \r\nprocesses and, where appropriate, joint mechanisms” \r\n(ibid., para. 52), as well as the need to elaborate “early \r\ncommunication and procedures for crisis consultation” \r\n(ibid., para. 29). In that regard, we call on the Security \r\nCouncil to fully implement resolution 2033 (2012), \r\nwhich decides, among other things,\r\n“to elaborate further ways of strengthening relations \r\nbetween the two Councils, including through \r\nachieving more effective annual consultative \r\nmeetings, the holding of timely consultations, and \r\ncollaborative field missions of the two Councils, \r\nas appropriate” (Security Council resolution 2033 \r\n(2012), para. 17)\r\nand\r\n“to formulate cohesive positions and strategies \r\non a case by-case basis in dealing with conflict \r\nsituations in Africa” (ibid.).\r\nUnfortunately, the annual report before us does \r\nnot reflect the commitment to regular engagement \r\nand consultation, aside from the ninth annual meeting \r\nbetween the Security Council and the Peace and \r\nSecurity Council, which took place in March. We \r\nbelieve that this points to the selectivity with which the \r\nSecurity Council coordinates its positions with those of \r\nthe African Union. South Africa reiterates its concern \r\nabout the tendency in certain cases where the Security \r\nCouncil selectively picks elements of decisions of \r\nregional organizations that advance the national \r\ninterests of some Council members. It is important that \r\nthe principle of subsidiarity be respected if we are to \r\nestablish better synergies for enhancing cooperation, \r\nespecially on the African continent. We therefore call \r\nfor greater consistency from the Council in engaging \r\nwith regional bodies.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council’s working \r\nmethods in general, we join other delegations in \r\nacknowledging the Security Council’s attempt to be \r\nmore transparent in its functioning and the small steps \r\ntaken in that regard, such as regularizing the briefings \r\nto Member States at the beginning and end of each \r\npresidency, and the increased number of public briefings \r\non the issues discussed. However, more needs to be done \r\nto include Member States in the Council’s deliberations, \r\nin particular those States directly affected by a specific \r\nconflict, We continue to believe that broader and more \r\ninclusive consultations by the Council with the larger \r\nmembership of the United Nations can only serve to \r\nenhance the Council’s efficacy and credibility.\r\nWe do not need to read the annual report of the \r\nSecurity Council to conclude that the Council has \r\nagain lapsed into dysfunction and has not been able \r\nto address the most pressing issues on its agenda, \r\nincluding the question of Palestine and the situation \r\nin Syria. In both instances the General Assembly has \r\nacted where the Council was unwilling or unable to \r\nrespond, including with respect to the resumption of the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s tenth emergency special session, \r\nheld pursuant to the Uniting for Peace resolution 377 \r\nA (V), to discuss the grave developments in Gaza, as \r\nwell as the adoption of resolution 64/10, endorsing the \r\nrecommendations of the United Nations Fact-Finding \r\nMission on the Gaza Conflict in 2009 and 2010, and \r\nthe appointment of a Special Envoy to Syria against the \r\nbackdrop of a total deadlock in the Security Council in \r\n2012.\r\nIt is our firm opinion that measures to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of the General Assembly regarding its role \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security \r\nshould be discussed and adopted. South Africa does not \r\nwish to see the General Assembly usurp the role of the \r\nSecurity Council, but we advocate the need to improve \r\non the balance of competence between the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council, as members of the \r\nAfrican Union called for in the Ezulwini Consensus. \r\nThat is especially critical at the present session, when we \r\nwill begin discussion on the selection and appointment \r\nof the next Secretary-General.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate our view that the \r\nrepresentative nature of the Assembly makes it the \r\nideal body to respond to and address issues of concern \r\nthat affect the entire world. We are therefore committed \r\nto seeing closer and better cooperation between the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Fesko (Ukraine): First of all, we would like \r\nto express our appreciation to Ambassador Gerard van \r\n20/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nBohemen and his team for preparing the introductory \r\npart of the Security Council report (A/70/2), and \r\nto Ambassador Matthew Rycroft for providing an \r\nexcellent presentation.\r\nAs a newly elected member of the Security Council \r\nfor the period 2016-2017, Ukraine takes particular \r\ninterest in the report. We welcome the attempt at \r\nmaking the document more concise. We believe that \r\nshortening the introductory part is a step in the right \r\ndirection in the preparation of a document for which \r\nthe General Assembly has long been calling, namely, \r\na more analytical and substantive paper and not a mere \r\nrecollection of the Council’s proceedings over the \r\nreporting period.\r\nIt is our strong belief that the membership of \r\nthe United Nations must be informed not only about \r\nwhat happened and when, but also why and how a \r\ngiven action was taken or not taken. That aspect is \r\nstill missing from the traditional annual reports of the \r\nCouncil. Having answers to such questions would not \r\nonly enhance Member States’ understanding of the \r\nCouncil’s work, but could also prove beneficial to the \r\nCouncil by encouraging it to find workable solutions to \r\nspecific situations.\r\nAnalysis of the decision-making processes in \r\ncases where the Council either failed to act or where \r\nits actions did not bring about the expected result in \r\nthe form of a peaceful resolution of a given conflict \r\ncould help identify areas for improvement in the \r\nCouncil’s methods of work. That would facilitate the \r\nsearch for more effective ways of addressing issues that \r\nare brought before the Council and dealing with them \r\nin a decisive and results-oriented manner, as opposed \r\nto following the dangerous trend of avoiding an issue \r\nup to the point of ignoring it. In other words, in our \r\nopinion, the annual report should provide the United \r\nNations membership with a clear answer as to how \r\nsuccessful the Security Council has been in carrying \r\nout its primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nA candid assessment reveals that behind many \r\npages of fine print lurks the conclusion that the \r\nSecurity Council has yet to rise to the challenges of \r\ntoday. As the external aggression against Ukraine \r\nclearly demonstrates, when the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations are violated, \r\nwhen international law is subject to frivolous and \r\nselective interpretations and when perpetrators avoid \r\naccountability, the world needs a strong Security \r\nCouncil that is capable of taking resolute action.\r\nWe need the Council both to protect the Charter \r\nand to follow it. Apparently, the second part of Article \r\n27, paragraph 3, of the Charter, which obligates a party \r\nto a dispute to abstain from voting, proved too high a \r\nmountain to climb both for a party in question — as \r\nwas the case with the two Russian vetoes on the draft \r\nresolutions concerning Ukraine — and the Council \r\nitself, which shied away from proper consideration of \r\nthe application of the relevant provision. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome and fully support the code of conduct \r\nregarding Security Council action against genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity or war crimes put forward by \r\nthe Accountability, Coherence and Transparency group, \r\nas well as the French-Mexican initiative on limiting the \r\nuse of the veto. Those are very timely initiatives that \r\nmay facilitate the transformation of the Council into a \r\nbody in which the veto right is used responsibly in the \r\ninterests of the world, and not abused to promote and \r\nprotect the narrow interests of a single party.\r\nUkraine recognizes that the aforementioned \r\nshortcomings are not the result of a lack of trying on the \r\npart of the overwhelming majority of Council members, \r\nincluding permanent ones, but rather the outcome of \r\nall-too-clear institutional deficiencies in the Council’s \r\ncomposition and established working methods. In that \r\nregard, we encourage the Council to explore new ways \r\nand approaches to improve its overall performance. \r\nAs an incoming member, Ukraine stands ready to \r\ncontribute to pertinent discussions on the subject, both \r\nwithin the Council and with the wider United Nations \r\nmembership.\r\nMr. Rakhmetullin (Kazakhstan): The delegation \r\nof Kazakhstan welcomes the report of the Security \r\nCouncil (A/70/2) and commends its outstanding work \r\nas one of the key entities responsible for regional and \r\nglobal peace and security. We acknowledge the sincere \r\ncommitment and stewardship of each of its Presidents, \r\nand we commend all the members of the Council for \r\ntheir tireless, year-long efforts, as manifested in this \r\ncomprehensive report on all aspects of the agenda.\r\nThe Security Council’s outcomes would be more \r\neffective if the report were analytical and evaluative \r\nand if it pointed out how the various decisions taken \r\ncould have greater impact and how their accompanying \r\nprocesses could be better utilized. It would also be \r\nadvantageous to have interim reports from the Council \r\n15-36233 21/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nin addition to the yearly one, to allow for ongoing \r\nfeedback. The report describes the remarkable work \r\nof various peacekeeping operations. It would also \r\nbe helpful if their mandates were comprehensive, \r\nrealistic and achievable and if there were an analysis \r\nof how they could be more effectively implemented. \r\nThe Council could also have benefited from greater \r\ndialogue with troop- and police-contributing countries \r\non their expanded mandates, mutual expectations and \r\nthe security of their personnel. The Security Council \r\ncould gain much from lessons learned and could \r\nreflect greater coordination among the Department \r\nof Peacekeeping Operations (DPKO), international \r\norganizations, regional structures and neighbouring \r\ncountries surrounding areas of conflict. Together with \r\nDPKO and regional organizations, the Council could \r\nmirror more analytically such operations in the field.\r\nKazakhstan appreciates the fact that the Council \r\nheld open debates on a vast range of topics — on \r\nsuch customary topics as women, children and armed \r\nconflict, inclusive development, the protection of \r\njournalists, Ebola and, for the first time, the security \r\nof small island developing States. While the debates \r\nserved as a platform for airing approaches, there is a \r\nstark need to further plan a comprehensive strategy \r\nrather than simply to archive statements. It would \r\nhelp the Council to work in close cooperation with the \r\nSecretariat, the United Nations system, the General \r\nAssembly, the Economic and Social Council and \r\nother international regional organizations. The work \r\nof the subsidiary bodies of the Council could also be \r\nstrengthened through close cooperation among them \r\nand United Nations specialized agencies and other \r\nbodies so that the Council becomes more robust in \r\naddressing the various complex issues that continue to \r\nevolve. A greater number of field missions by Security \r\nCouncil members would also help its members to \r\nappreciate the realities on the ground.\r\nWe would also like to see a better reflection \r\nof the Security Council’s response to the various \r\nrecommendations of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwith respect to both individual and groups of countries, \r\nso that there is greater momentum towards dynamic \r\nchange. Security Council reform is part of a global \r\nprocess of reform of the United Nations aimed at \r\nenhancing its response capabilities in tackling complex \r\nand multidimensional issues. That must not lie outside \r\nthe responsibility and accountability of the Council \r\nitself.\r\nSince 2016 is the year for the selection of the \r\neighth Secretary-General, we look forward to seeing \r\nthe report of the Security Council’s deliberations on \r\nthe selection process in close coordination with the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nKazakhstan, for its part, will continue to play its \r\nrole and to wholeheartedly support efforts to make the \r\nCouncil more responsive, accessible and effective in \r\nfulfilling its mandate as set forth in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme, at the outset, to thank the Permanent Representative \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland for introducing the report (A/70/2) of the \r\nSecurity Council to the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session. I also thank and congratulate \r\nthe Permanent Representative of New Zealand for \r\ncoordinating the preparation and the adoption of the \r\nintroduction to the report.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on \r\nbehalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nThe Security Council continues to face new \r\nchallenges in the implementation of the mandate \r\nconferred on it by the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nA number of those matters weigh heavily on the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security. In \r\nfact, beyond the conflicts and regional disputes already \r\non its agenda, the Council is increasingly forced to \r\naddress the issues associated with the fight against \r\nterrorism and extremism and combating transnational \r\norganized crime.\r\nFaced with those global phenomena, it is important \r\nto note that the Security Council has reacted with one \r\nvoice and in a concerted manner by taking appropriate \r\nmeasures to counter those threats, in particular the \r\nthreat of international terrorism. Moreover, the Security \r\nCouncil has maintained and strengthened the practice \r\nof holding public debates on thematic issues related to \r\nconflict prevention, peacebuilding and peacekeeping, \r\nwomen and peace and security, and the role of young \r\npeople in the fight to combat violent extremism, among \r\nothers. Morocco participated in almost all of those \r\ndebates and fully appreciates them, because they make \r\nit possible for the members of the Security Council to \r\nlisten to and interact with all the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations. As we mentioned previously, it is \r\n22/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nimportant for the debate topics to be focused so that we \r\ncan benefit as much as possible from them.\r\nIn the same vein, my delegation believes that the \r\npractice, now established, of holding annual debates \r\non the Council’s working methods is a positive that \r\ncontributes, specifically through the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup dedicated to the issue, to imbuing its work with \r\ngreater effectiveness, efficiency and transparency. My \r\ndelegation wishes to congratulate the members of the \r\nCouncil for the important improvements introduced in \r\nrecent years in that principal organ’s working methods. \r\nWe are persuaded that the latter will continue to address \r\nthose questions with great interest.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation wishes to stress the \r\nimportance of strengthened interaction between the \r\nCouncil and the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC) and \r\nits country-specific configurations. The briefings by \r\nthe Chair of the Commission and the country-specific \r\nconfigurations allow the Security Council to integrate \r\nthe related peacebuilding components essential to \r\nsustainable peace into its consideration of situations \r\non the Commission’s agenda and its decisions in that \r\nregard.\r\nThe Security Council has continued to pay particular \r\nattention to the African continent. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation welcomes the significant progress made by \r\nmany African countries on the path of peacebuilding, \r\nimproving security conditions and the normalization \r\nof political life and the implementation of national \r\nreconciliation processes.\r\nWith regard to the Central African Republic, \r\nthe period under review includes the deployment \r\nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic \r\nin September 2014, nearly two years after the outbreak \r\nof the crisis in that country. Morocco, in accordance \r\nwith its commitment to peace and stability on the \r\ncontinent, worked during its 2012-2013 term on the \r\nCouncil to create the Mission and was among the \r\nfirst countries to send troops into the Central African \r\nRepublic, initially to constitute the guard unit and then \r\nto strengthen its presence at the time the Mission was \r\nbeing established. Since then, significant progress has \r\nbeen achieved, notably at the political level, with the \r\nconvening of the Bangui Forum, which for the first \r\ntime brought representatives from all levels of Central \r\nAfrican society to take important decisions, which we \r\nshould ensure are implemented.\r\nMorocco also chairs the PBC country-specific \r\nconfiguration on the Central African Republic and \r\nworks to strengthen peacebuilding in that country. The \r\nwork of the configuration essentially focuses on support \r\nfor the political process, particularly the financing of \r\nelections, but also on national reconciliation projects \r\nand strengthening the rule of law. The Central African \r\nRepublic remains in an unstable situation that requires \r\nour ongoing support and special attention, particularly \r\non the part of the Council, to put the country back on a \r\npath to peace and stability.\r\nWith regard to the Sahel, Morocco has never ceased \r\nto draw the international community’s attention to \r\nthe situation in the region. That role was pursued and \r\nstrengthened during our Council term, which strongly \r\nsupported the establishment of the United Nations \r\nIntegrated Strategy for the Sahel. We note that the hope \r\nand the approach behind the implementation of the \r\nStrategy is constantly being eroded,  despite the fact that \r\nthe deteriorating situation in certain regions of the Sahel \r\ndemands increased and substantial support on the part \r\nof the international community. We hope that the next \r\nbriefing by the Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, at the end of the month, will enable us to be \r\ninformed in a more detailed manner on the progress \r\nmade, especially on the difficulties encountered in \r\nimplementing the Strategy. It is important to think \r\nabout an action plan to implement and improve the \r\nStrategy and to minimize its shortcomings.\r\nThe Security Council has continued its regular \r\nreview of the Palestinian question, and my delegation \r\nhas participated in all Council open debates on the issue. \r\nNevertheless, we must take the opportunity afforded by \r\nthe review of today’s report to note that, unfortunately, \r\nthe situation continues to deteriorate in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories in general and in Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif in particular, following an escalation of \r\nviolence and repeated incursions by Israeli settlers on \r\nHaram Al-Sharif of the Al-Aqsa Mosque, in violation of \r\nthe relevant resolutions of the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In that regard, on the instructions \r\nof His Majesty the King, as President of the Al-Quds \r\nCommittee, on 26 September, on the sidelines of the \r\nseventieth session of the General Assembly, Morocco \r\nchaired a meeting of the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation’s Ministerial Contact Group, which \r\nadopted a declaration condemning the Israeli violations \r\nand calling for protecting Al-Quds Al-Sharif.\r\nThe impasse on the Palestinian issue must not \r\ncontinue. The Security Council must play its role in \r\n15-36233 23/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nfinding a solution to the Palestinian issue and bringing \r\nthe two parties to the negotiating table to reach a lasting \r\nsolution to enable the establishment of the State of \r\nPalestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, based on a \r\ntwo-State solution and within the 4 July 1967 borders, \r\nliving side by side in peace and security.\r\nWith regard to Libya, since the uprising of the Libyan \r\npeople in February 2011, the Kingdom of Morocco has \r\nconsistently supported the legitimate aspirations of the \r\nLibyan people to live in dignity and democracy. Also, \r\nat the request of the Secretary-General, His Majesty \r\nKing Mohammed VI agreed to host the talks for \r\ninter-Libyan peace in Skhirat, under the auspices of the \r\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General for Libya and \r\nHead of the United Nations Support Mission in Libya. \r\nThe talks led to the initialling of the Skhirat political \r\nagreement on 11 July. In that regard, Council members \r\nexpressed their gratitude to Morocco for its efforts to \r\nmake progress on the agreement and welcomed the \r\nLibyan dialogue. My delegation continues to call all \r\nLibyan parties to persevere on the path of dialogue to \r\nreach a settlement to the situation in that country with \r\nthe participation of all sectors of Libyan society.\r\nThe Security Council has devoted a major part \r\nof its agenda and its meetings to the fight against the \r\nscourge of terrorism. That demonstrates the gravity of \r\nthe horrific phenomenon and the increasing threat it \r\nposes to the international community. In that regard, \r\nmy delegation welcomes the adoption, during the \r\nperiod under review, of Security Council resolutions \r\n2170 (2014), 2178 (2014) and 2199 (2015) and Security \r\nCouncil presidential statements S/PRST/2015/4 and \r\nS/PRST/2015/14, which introduce a set of measures \r\nto counter terrorist groups, including Daesh and Boko \r\nHaram, and to address the threat posed by foreign \r\nterrorist fighters.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, an active participant, \r\nresponsible and respected on the international scene \r\nin the area of the fight against terrorism and religious \r\nextremism, has developed for that purpose an approach \r\nbased on the following principles.\r\nFirst, we must work to optimize security governance \r\nand to upgrade the legal framework for combating \r\nterrorism.\r\nSecondly, we must combat social instability and \r\npromote sustainable human development. We must \r\nrecall that His Majesty the King launched in 2005 the \r\nnational initiative for human development, specifically \r\nto combat social gaps, exclusion and poverty.\r\nThirdly, we must restructure the religious area, \r\nparticularly through the training of imams on the real \r\nteachings of Islam based on tolerance, coexistence, \r\nopenness and respect for others. We should note in \r\nthat regard that the countries of the friends of Africa \r\nand Europe have concluded bilateral agreements with \r\nMorocco for the training of imams in Morocco, who \r\nlater become trainers in their own respective countries. \r\nThat experience, in its three dimensions, has led to the \r\nMoroccan approach to combat incitement to commit \r\nterrorist acts motivated by extremism and intolerance, \r\nwhich was shared during a high-level meeting held \r\nin 30 September 2014 with members of the Security \r\nCouncil Counter-Terrorism Committee (CTC), together \r\nwith the Members of the United Nations, at the initiative \r\nof Morocco and the CTC Executive Directorate.\r\nI cannot conclude without warmly congratulating \r\nEgypt, Japan, Senegal, Ukraine and Uruguay on their \r\nwell-deserved election as non-permanent members of \r\nthe Security Council for the period 2016-2017. I am sure \r\nthey will fully and successfully contribute to the efforts \r\nof the Council for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly for convening today’s \r\nmeeting. My delegation welcomes this opportunity to \r\nexpress its views on the report of the Security Council \r\n(A/70/2). This annual debate is useful in reviewing \r\nnot just the work of the Security Council but also the \r\nmanner in which the Council operates. We also thank \r\nAmbassador Matthew Rycroft of the United Kingdom \r\nfor presenting the report in his capacity as the President \r\nof the Security Council for this month. \r\nThe Security Council is the premier institution \r\ncharged with responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security — which does not, of \r\ncourse, strip the General Assembly of its role in that \r\nregard. The Council acts on behalf of the broader United \r\nNations membership, and is therefore accountable to it. \r\nOnly with a substantive annual report by the Council \r\nand a two-way communication between the Council \r\nand the General Assembly can this debate on the report \r\nof the Security Council become meaningful. I would \r\nlike to outline our main observations and impressions \r\nabout the Council’s report. \r\n24/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nWe believe that the Security Council conducted \r\nits business reasonably efficiently, as reflected in the \r\nnumber of meetings that it held as well as the substantial \r\nnumber of outcomes that it was able to agree on. We \r\nappreciate the Council’s ability to reach consensus and \r\nmake progress on counter-terrorism issues. Important \r\nwork was done in that regard during the past reporting \r\nperiod. \r\nThere has been a gradual yet perceptible increase \r\nin the number of public meetings. We hope that such \r\na culture of transparency will continue to grow. We \r\nare also pleased to note the continuation of wrap-up \r\nsessions by the monthly presidencies of the Council, \r\nwhich is a practice that Pakistan revived during its \r\npresidency in January 2013. Seven such meetings were \r\norganized during the reporting period.\r\nOn the other hand, the report of the Council \r\ncontinues to be a compilation of documents and \r\ninformation, and it lacks substance. More than a fourth \r\nof the report is made up of compendiums of meetings. \r\nWhile we understand the possible difficulties in \r\npreparing a substantive report, greater effort is required \r\nin that regard. That would enable all delegations to \r\noffer substantive comments and would make the debate \r\non today’s agenda item more useful.\r\nWe recognize those limitations and would like to \r\nshare some observations on the work of the Security \r\nCouncil. The continuation of the robust work of the \r\nCouncil in peacekeeping is indeed welcome. As a \r\nleading troop-contributing country (TCC), Pakistan \r\ntakes pride in being a part of that important endeavour \r\nof the Council. In order to make United Nations \r\npeacekeeping more effective, however, we believe \r\nthat closer interaction and consultations between the \r\nCouncil and the TCCs is warranted. That continues to \r\nbe a persistent shortcoming in the Council’s work. We \r\nremain concerned at the Council’s tendency to use in \r\nparticular measures under Chapter VII of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, without fully utilizing Chapter \r\nVI and Chapter VIII possibilities. \r\nThe Council’s inability to act effectively or \r\ndecisively, or even to pronounce itself clearly, on \r\nthe situation in Palestine is inexplicable and frankly \r\ninexcusable. That inability imperils peace and security \r\nand contributes to aggression and violence. Importantly, \r\nit reinforces the perceptions of selectivity. An impression \r\nof double standards in its approach will undermine the \r\neffectiveness of the Council. The Council must not only \r\nstake its claim to being fair, unbiased and effective; it \r\nmust also be perceived by others to be so. The Council \r\nwould also enhance its credibility if it were able to \r\nrespond to the raging violence and spreading chaos and \r\ndisorder elsewhere in the Middle East. \r\nThe Council and the General Assembly should \r\nwork as partners in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. The General Assembly can discuss \r\nvexing issues that do not find a solution in the Council. \r\nThe number of annual meetings of the Council clearly \r\nindicates the burden that it bears on a day-to-day basis. \r\nIt should not seek to further burden itself by trying \r\nto assume functions that other United Nations bodies \r\nare mandated to perform. That approach not only \r\nundermines the effectiveness of the relevant United \r\nNations bodies, it also prevents the Security Council \r\nfrom devoting more focus and time to the issues that \r\ndirectly fall within its scope.\r\nThe Council needs to be more responsive to the \r\nmembership’s call for improvements in its working \r\nmethods. We acknowledge some progress in the \r\nCouncil’s interaction with the wider membership, \r\nsharing penholderships with non-permanent members \r\nand the adoption of a Pakistan-initiated proposal of \r\nintra-Council dialogue. However, most Member States \r\nagree that progress in those areas is far too slow. \r\nThe Council’s working methods need to be in sync \r\nwith the values promoted by the United Nations — the \r\nvalues of transparency, inclusiveness and participation. \r\nPakistan made certain recommendations in that regard \r\nduring last year’s Assembly debate (see A/69/PV.58) \r\non this agenda item. We also proposed that a synopsis \r\nof the views of all Member States be circulated as an \r\nofficial document. We were pleased to see action taken \r\nby the President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session in that regard. \r\nThe foregoing views and suggestions can still \r\nbe helpful in improving the working methods of the \r\nCouncil. Also, a joint committee of the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly could be formed to \r\nexamine implementation of our recommendations.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that Pakistan is \r\nalso open to other initiatives that could promote the \r\nvalues I have just outlined. To that end, we assure the \r\nPresident of our cooperation and support.\r\nMs. Zahir (Maldives): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwishes to thank His Excellency Mr. Gerard van \r\n15-36233 25/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nBohemen, Permanent Representative of New Zealand, \r\nand his team for their efforts in drafting this year’s \r\nreport (A/70/2) of the Security Council. I also wish to \r\nexpress my appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Matthew \r\nRycroft, Permanent Representative of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, which \r\ncurrently holds the presidency of the Security Council, \r\nfor introducing the document here today.\r\nMy delegation takes note of the activities, \r\ninitiatives and decisions taken by the Security Council \r\nduring the reporting period, which have had a positive \r\nimpact in a number of situations across the globe that \r\nhave and continue to pose threats to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Maldives commends \r\nthe efforts that have been made to enhance the \r\naccountability, coherence and transparency of the \r\nCouncil. The efforts made to acknowledge the broader \r\ndimensions of international peace and security are \r\ngreatly welcome and form the foundation for a Council \r\nthat is truly representative of the Organization’s \r\nmembership. The Arria Formula meeting of the \r\nSecurity Council in June on the security dimensions \r\nof climate change and the open debate on the security \r\nconcerns of small island developing States in July of \r\nthis year (see S/PV.7499) are two recent initiatives \r\nthat embody a necessary recognition of the vast array \r\nof security concerns faced by States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is important that the momentum that \r\nthose events generated not be lost.\r\nThe report of the Security Council constitutes \r\nan annual exercise of summarizing past activities \r\nconducted by the Council. We note that it does \r\nnot effectively underline important priority areas. \r\nHowever, while debates in the General Assembly focus \r\non closer cooperation between the Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council and on the Council’s ability to foster \r\ninternational peace and security, my delegation would \r\nwelcome a more analytical and reflective approach, \r\nwith a view to making the Council more effective in its \r\nfuture work.\r\nThe Security Council is a principal organ of \r\nthe United Nations, and the adoption of its annual \r\nreport should be an occasion for more comprehensive \r\nengagement on the part of the entire membership of \r\nthe United Nations. Non-members of the Security \r\nCouncil should be afforded an opportunity to make \r\ntheir suggestions and share their analyses on the \r\nefficacy with which the Council has represented the \r\nOrganization for the year. To that end, my delegation \r\njoins the call for an open debate of the Council to be \r\nheld prior to the finalization of the Council’s report.\r\nWith regard to the substance of the document, \r\nMaldives would like to highlight its deepening concern \r\nabout the Council’s inaction on a number of issues \r\nthat are of dire importance to international peace \r\nand security. The inability of the Security Council to \r\ntake concrete action with regard to the situations in \r\nPalestine and Syria and in countering the expansion of \r\nand the impacts caused by the so-called Islamic State \r\nrepresents one of the gravest failings of our time. That \r\nthose issues have not been meaningfully addressed \r\nby the Council negates the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and in international law.\r\nIt is imperative that the report adequately analyse \r\nthe work of the Council, while acknowledging its \r\nshortcomings, and that an opportunity be given for \r\nthose shortcomings to be addressed when moving \r\nforward. The Council acts on behalf of the entire \r\nmembership of the Organization, and any inability \r\nto fulfil its mandate calls into question the Council’s \r\nlegitimacy and relevance. Any such inability therefore \r\nalso calls into question the legitimacy and relevance \r\nof the Organization as a whole. The States Members \r\nof the United Nations deserve better. The people of \r\nthe world, whom we represent, deserve better as well. \r\nMaldives looks forward to continuing its engagement \r\nand advocacy in favour of a Council that is both truly \r\nreflective of the broader membership and representative \r\nof its views.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to align myself with the previous \r\nspeakers who affirmed the importance of improving \r\nthe relationship between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which, as the principal consultative \r\norgan for States Members of the United Nations, is the \r\nforum in which they can express themselves and voice \r\ntheir opinions. \r\nIn its annual report (A/70/2), the Security Council \r\nhighlights its role as contributor to the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security pursuant to its mandate \r\nunder the Charter of the United Nations. It is important \r\nto note, however, that the Security Council’s role does \r\nnot preclude the General Assembly’s own role as a \r\nmain actor in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Indeed, the General Assembly’s role in \r\nterms of international peace and security should not be \r\nlimited to briefings such as today’s, which are merely \r\npro forma.\r\n26/27 15-36233\r\nA/70/PV.51 12/11/2015\r\nThe report we have before us is simply a quantitative \r\nprocedural account of the cases and situations under \r\nreview at the Security Council. It is a compendium \r\nof events that occurred during the period covered and \r\nof the activities undertaken by the Council in the past \r\nyear. We believe that such a procedural review does \r\nnot reflect the true role that could be played by the \r\nGeneral Assembly together with the Security Council \r\nin dealing with questions related to international peace \r\nand security. We have therefore stressed in all of our \r\nstatements that a pivotal aspect of reforming the United \r\nNations would be to reform the relationship between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council with \r\na view to implementing a better and more effective \r\nrelationship leading to the General Assembly’s taking \r\nits rightful place and playing its full role in that regard. \r\nWe also reiterate the importance of taking into \r\naccount the concerns of those Member States that find \r\nthemselves on the agenda of the Security Council, and \r\ncall the Assembly’s attention to the fact that the State \r\nmost concerned in a Security Council discussion is \r\noften completely excluded from the discussions and \r\nconsultations on it. Furthermore, the new practice \r\nthat gives certain States the right to be an exclusive \r\npenholder revives, in essence, an outmoded colonial \r\nmethodology that is not supported by the Charter.\r\nIn our view, reforming the working methods of \r\nthe Security Council and its procedures is vital for \r\nachieving comprehensive reform, one that provides for \r\nthe just geographic distribution of membership in the \r\nCouncil among the continents of the world, in particular \r\nour mother continent, Africa, which consists of 54 \r\nStates. In fact, more than 67 per cent of the matters on \r\nthe Council’s agenda are related to Africa. \r\nAs we are concentrating today on the procedural \r\nmeasures needed to improve the effectiveness of the \r\nSecurity Council in its work, we reaffirm what has \r\nbeen expressed in the documents of the ministerial \r\nconferences of the Non-Aligned Movement countries, \r\nincluding the conference held in Bali in May 2010 on \r\nimprovement of the Security Council working methods. \r\nWe also support the implementation of the note by \r\nthe President of the Security Council on procedural \r\nmeasures, contained in document S/2010/507, as well \r\nas the circulation of the Council’s daily programme \r\nof work in the United Nations Journal, which would \r\nmake it accessible to all. In addition, transparency and \r\nobjectivity require that the monthly programme of work \r\nof the Council also be circulated to all Member States \r\nat the beginning of each month. \r\nWhen it comes to briefings by members of the \r\nSecretariat or representatives of subsidiary bodies \r\nof the Security Council, we stress the importance of \r\nmaking written texts and any audiovisual materials \r\nthat accompany such briefings available to all Member \r\nStates. With respect to official documents of the \r\nCouncil, especially reports of the Secretary-General on \r\npeacekeeping missions, we underline the importance \r\nof circulating such reports in all six official languages \r\nof the United Nations long enough before the start of \r\nSecurity Council deliberations for delegations to review \r\nthem. In many cases such documents are circulated only \r\nin draft form and often only to members of the Security \r\nCouncil, while the report under consideration, which \r\nis an official document, is rarely circulated to Member \r\nStates before the day itself of the deliberations,  and \r\nsometimes even only afterwards.\r\nWith respect to the types of meetings held, \r\ndespite the relative increase in the number of open \r\nor public meetings, it goes without saying that the \r\nmajority of Council meetings are in the form of closed \r\nconsultations, and thus are exclusively for members \r\nof the Security Council and their invitees, whose \r\nopinions are sought, for example representatives of the \r\nSecretariat. However, for objectivity and transparency \r\nto be ensured, at a minimum the State concerned should \r\nbe allowed to take part in such consultations. We also \r\nstress the importance of the principle of consultation \r\nand cooperation between the Security Council and \r\nregional and subregional organizations, including the \r\nholding of joint consultative meetings in compliance \r\nwith Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter. We \r\nwould also note the right of Member States to participate \r\nin open meetings in accordance with Articles 37 and 39 \r\nof the Charter and the Security Council’s provisional \r\nrules of procedure.\r\nIn conclusion, we stress the importance of \r\ncooperation and coordination among the organs of the \r\nUnited Nations, including through consultations among \r\nthe Presidents of the Security Council, the General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council. Such an \r\napproach in no way violates the exclusive competencies \r\nand mandates of each organ. We look forward to the \r\nfirst fruits of reform, in particular the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council and its working methods, together \r\nwith its relationship with the General Assembly. That \r\n15-36233 27/27\r\n12/11/2015 A/70/PV.51\r\nreform should be undertaken in a practical manner that \r\nrevitalizes the role of the General Assembly as the main \r\ndeliberative organ of the United Nations. \r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly takes note of the report of the \r\nSecurity Council contained in document A/70/2?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.40 p.m.\r\n"
