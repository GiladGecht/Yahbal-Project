On behalf of \r\nthe Council and on my own behalf, I wish to offer our \r\nsympathies to the families of the victims and the people \r\nof those countries. We stand united as men and women \r\nwho are defending human rights.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLet me, at the outset, congratulate the newly elected \r\nmembers of the Council for the period 2016-2018 and \r\nwish them all a successful term. The General Assembly \r\ndecided, in its resolution 60/251, that membership \r\nin the Human Rights Council is open to all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. Furthermore, the \r\nGeneral Assembly decided that States shall take into \r\naccount the contribution of candidates to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights and their voluntary \r\npledges and commitments made thereto. In that \r\ncontext, the Geneva community and I took note of the \r\nvoluntary pledges made by some States. We also took \r\nnote of the event on 15 July 2015 organized by Amnesty \r\nInternational and the International Service for Human \r\nRights, with the co-sponsorship of the Permanent \r\nMissions of Botswana, Brazil and the Netherlands, \r\nin which some of the candidates participated. The \r\nGeneral Assembly also decided that members elected \r\nto the Council shall uphold the highest standards in \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights, and \r\nfully cooperate with the Council. With regard to the \r\nlatter, namely, cooperation with the Council, I call on \r\nall States, and in particular all States members of the \r\nHuman Rights Council that have not yet done so, to \r\nissue standing invitations to the Council mechanisms.\r\nThe year 2015 marks the ninth year since the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council. As it \r\nenters its tenth year, the Council’s record testifies to \r\nhigh responsiveness in dealing with human rights \r\nissues all over the world. The Human Rights Council \r\nhas continued to be actively engaged in cases of urgent \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.53\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n53rd plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 16 November 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nand chronic violations of human rights. In 2015, in \r\naddition to its regular sessions, one special session was \r\nheld, along with an enhanced interactive dialogue on \r\nmigration during the June session, and a new procedure \r\nfor informal briefings with the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights was added to the Council’s toolbox.\r\nA total of 137 resolutions, decisions and President’s \r\nstatements were adopted in 2015, 84 of them without \r\na vote. As President of the Human Rights Council, I \r\nbelieve that we should strive for as much consensus \r\nas possible and as much voting as necessary. Many \r\nof the resolutions, including on country issues, were \r\ncross-regional initiatives, affirming the resolve of the \r\nCouncil to take action on important human rights issues \r\nby overcoming different political positions. One such \r\nexample is the resolution on promoting reconciliation, \r\naccountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, which was \r\nadopted in September by consensus and co-sponsored \r\nby Sri Lanka. Another is the resolution on the rights \r\nof the child, which is negotiated in Geneva during the \r\nMarch session.\r\nLet me briefly summarize some of the Council’s \r\ncountry-specific decisions that were taken in the course \r\nof the year. Syria has continued to be high on the agenda \r\nof the Council throughout the year, and the mandate of \r\nthe Independent International Commission of Inquiry \r\non the Syrian Arab Republic has been extended once \r\nagain. The Commission of Inquiry, which presented its \r\ntenth report in September, once again documents gross \r\nhuman rights violations that are massive in extent and \r\nscope.\r\nThe Council also heard reports from the \r\nCommission of Inquiry on Eritrea and from the Special \r\nRapporteur for the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. The Commission of Inquiry on Eritrea was set \r\nup to investigate systematic, widespread and grave \r\nviolations of human rights with a view to ensuring full \r\naccountability, including where such violations may \r\namount to crimes against humanity.\r\nIn April, the Council held a special session in the \r\nlight of the terrorist attacks and human rights abuses \r\nand violations committed by the terrorist group Boko \r\nHaram. It requested the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights to work in close cooperation and \r\nconsultation with States affected by acts perpetrated by \r\nthe terrorist group Boko Haram and collect information \r\nfrom them in order to prepare a report on violations \r\nand abuses of human rights and atrocities committed \r\nby the group, with a view to ensuring accountability. \r\nThe Council also reaffirmed that the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights for all and the rule of law are \r\nessential in the fight against terrorism, and recognized \r\nthat effective counter-terrorism measures and the \r\nprotection of human rights can only be complementary \r\nand are mutually reinforcing.\r\nThe Independent Commission of Inquiry on the \r\n2014 Gaza conflict presented its report in June and \r\npointed to the possible commission of war crimes by \r\nboth Israel and Palestinian armed groups and outlined \r\na number of steps for the international community to \r\ntake. In March, the High Commissioner was requested \r\nto urgently dispatch a mission to investigate violations \r\nand abuses of international human rights law committed \r\nin Libya since 2014. He was also asked to strengthen the \r\npresence of the Office for the High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees in Palestine. Another mission was mandated \r\nto monitor and report on the human rights situation in \r\nSouth Sudan with a view to ensuring accountability and \r\ncomplementarity with the African Union Commission \r\nof Inquiry. The Council also extended existing country-\r\nspecific special procedures mandates — Special \r\nRapporteurs and Independent Experts — on Belarus, \r\nCambodia, the Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Eritrea, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Mali, Myanmar, Somalia and \r\nthe Sudan.\r\nDuring its three most recent regular sessions, the \r\nCouncil has held, among other debates, a total of 17 \r\npanel discussions with panellists, including a variety \r\nof stakeholders, on themes such as the question of the \r\ndeath penalty, climate change, the rights of persons \r\nwith disabilities, the state of racial discrimination \r\nworldwide, the rights of the child, equal enjoyment \r\nby every girl of the right to education, the effects of \r\nterrorism on the enjoyment of human rights, the rights of \r\nwomen, unilateral coercive measures, good governance \r\nin public service and the impact of the world drug \r\nproblem on the enjoyment of human rights. The Council \r\nalso held a panel on the situation of human rights in \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. This year’s \r\nhigh-level panel discussion on mainstreaming human \r\nrights focused on the enhancement of international \r\ncooperation in the field of human rights. In 2016, at its \r\ntenth anniversary, the mainstreaming panel, with heads \r\nand senior officials of United Nations agencies, will \r\nfocus on the Sustainable Development Goals and human \r\nrights, with an emphasis on the right to development.\r\n15-36749 3/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nThe Council also established two new special \r\nprocedures mandates — one on the enjoyment of human \r\nrights by persons with albinism and the other on the \r\nright to privacy. All in all, there are now 56 mandates \r\nin total covering both country and thematic mandates. \r\nFormer Secretary-General Kofi Annan once called \r\nthem the crown jewels of the human rights system, \r\nand indeed, special procedures are the Council’s and \r\nthe international community’s eyes and ears, as they \r\nmonitor, report and advise on human rights issues \r\nthroughout the world. As of 11 November, 114 Member \r\nStates and one non-member observer State had extended \r\na standing invitation to thematic special procedures. \r\nIn line with resolution 60/251, I call on all States that \r\nhave not yet done so to issue standing invitations to \r\nthe special procedures mandate-holders and to fully \r\ncooperate with the Council’s mechanisms, including by \r\nimplementing their recommendations, in an effort to \r\nstrengthen human rights worldwide.\r\nThe Council has also made progress on enhancing \r\nits functionality by, among other things, adopting a \r\nPresident’s statement at the June session. The many \r\ndiscussions leading to that President’s statement \r\ntouched on many more aspects and showed the need \r\nnot only to implement the statement, as a step forward, \r\nbut also to continue discussing those matters. In that \r\ncontext, I also see a need for better cooperation and \r\ncoordination between Geneva and New York, with a \r\nview to minimizing unnecessary duplication, being \r\nmore resource-efficient and, ultimately, working \r\ntogether to strengthen the United Nations human rights \r\nsystem.\r\nI am also pleased to inform the Assembly that \r\nwe have continued to make the work of the Council \r\naccessible to persons with disabilities, pursuant to the \r\nlegal obligations arising from the Convention on the \r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities and in line with the \r\nmandate given to the Council’s task force on that issue. \r\nAt every session of the Council, one panel was made \r\naccessible, in addition to the annual panel on the rights \r\nof persons with disabilities. At the most recent session \r\nof the Council in September, the panel discussion on \r\na human rights-based approach to good governance \r\nin public service was made accessible through the \r\nprovision of international sign-language interpretation, \r\ncaptioning and a webcast of those services. We remain \r\ncommitted, at the Council, to that issue through the \r\ntask force that continues to report to us on progress, \r\nincluding best practices.\r\nAllow me now to turn to comment, from my \r\nperspective, on the highly valuable and unique \r\nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. We are now getting closer \r\nto the end of the second cycle of that peer review \r\nmechanism, as well as to the beginning of the third. \r\nThe UPR continues to get positive feedback from all \r\nactors involved. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto highlight a number of positive trends that I had the \r\nprivilege of witnessing over the course of the year. Of \r\ncourse, there are also challenges ahead that will require \r\nour attention and concerted action. The principle of the \r\nuniversality of the process continues to be preserved. \r\nAll States scheduled for review came, and most of \r\nthem came with delegations at the ministerial level. \r\nThat demonstrates the commitment of all States to \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review, which is of the utmost \r\nimportance. Nevertheless, challenges remain and, \r\nin particular, those related to the participation and \r\ninvolvement of States that have no representation in \r\nGeneva or only a very small one. We are aware of that \r\nchallenge, and the Office of the High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights has put in place a variety of programmes \r\nand activities to address the needs of those States and to \r\nensure their participation in the UPR.\r\nAnother important principle is that of periodicity, \r\nwhich offers the opportunity to measure progress. \r\nThe focus must be on the implementation of \r\nrecommendations. Ideally, therefore, national reports \r\nand presentations in the Working Group refer to the \r\nimplementation of recommendations from the previous \r\nreview cycle. That rightly reflects the cyclical nature \r\nof the reviews and the process involving presentations \r\nto the Working Group on the UPR in Geneva. Going \r\nforward, there is no doubt that that focus on follow-up \r\nand implementation, reporting on the impact and the \r\nchanges on the ground, will need to be stressed much \r\nmore. That will also help to safeguard the credibility of \r\nthe mechanism.\r\nIn that regard, more and more States are, on a \r\nvoluntary basis, either submitting mid-term reports, \r\nwhich take stock of the progress made, or using the \r\nframework provided by the Human Rights Council \r\nto share the progress made and challenges faced in \r\nthe implementation of the recommendations. States \r\nare also increasingly strengthening their national \r\nprocesses and systems so as to enable a more systematic \r\nengagement with and follow-up to the recommendations \r\nfrom the human rights mechanisms, including the \r\n4/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nUniversal Periodic Review. That approach is also \r\nhighly encouraging and should be further pursued. I \r\nam pleased to note that, in comparison with the first \r\ncycle, bilateral matters tend to be less present in the \r\nreviews. I welcome the self-restraint exerted by the \r\nStates concerned, thereby contributing to preserving \r\nthe constructive, consensual and non-politicized nature \r\nof the Universal Periodic Review.\r\nI would like to turn to an issue of concern that \r\ntranscends the review and concerns the work of the \r\nCouncil in general, which is the protection of the role \r\nof civil society in our work. The active participation \r\nand contribution of civil-society organizations and \r\nnational human rights institutions are central to the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms, \r\nand they contribute to making it a unique forum among \r\nother United Nations intergovernmental organs. Civil \r\nsociety, human rights defenders, non-governmental \r\norganizations and national institutions for the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights not only contribute to \r\nour discussions, but they also make us more effective \r\nand provide us with a mirror image of the realities on \r\nthe ground. And in that regard, civil society is not just \r\nsomething that is nice to have: it is at the core of our \r\nwork and at the core of human rights.\r\nIt is therefore essential that representatives of \r\ncivil society be able to operate in a free, open and safe \r\nenvironment that protects and promotes their own human \r\nrights. Over the course of the year, I have been apprised \r\nand seized of alleged and verified cases of intimidation, \r\nthreats and reprisals against individuals from civil-\r\nsociety organizations, national human rights institutions \r\nand even special-procedures mandate-holders. Many of \r\nthose cases are also documented in the report of the \r\nSecretary-General on cooperation with the United \r\nNations, its representatives and mechanisms in the field \r\nof human rights (A/HRC/30/29), which is presented \r\nannually in September to the Human Rights Council.\r\nI have repeatedly appealed to the Council to ensure \r\nthe safe participation and involvement of civil society \r\nin our work and, where required, I have followed up \r\ndirectly with the States concerned. I would like once \r\nagain to reiterate that, without the contribution of civil \r\nsociety, the work of the Council, the Universal Periodic \r\nReview and other mechanisms would be much less \r\neffective. The participation of civil society should be \r\npreserved, and individuals working with civil society \r\norganizations should be protected from intimidation of \r\nany type.\r\nIn that context, I would also like to stress the need \r\nto implement Human Rights Council resolution 24/24, \r\non cooperation with the United Nations. The Council \r\ndecided in 2013 to establish a focal point on reprisals \r\nand intimidation in the context of cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations, a topic that, at the time, was also being \r\nconsidered by the General Assembly. As President of the \r\nCouncil, I am pleased to note that that item is now closed \r\nand that subsequently States from all regions expressed \r\ntheir support for the prompt implementation of Council \r\nresolution 24/24. That brings me to a point that I wish \r\nto underline. While the Council is undoubtedly de jure \r\na subsidiary body of the General Assembly, we trust \r\nthat our decisions are respected and, in the form of our \r\nannual report, acknowledged in toto.\r\nLet me briefly turn to another subject, namely, \r\nthe welcome and increased participation of the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs) and small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) in the work of the Human Rights Council. \r\nIn that regard, the Voluntary Technical Assistance \r\nTrust Fund to Support the Participation of LDCs and \r\nSIDS in the work of the Human Rights Council has \r\nbeen crucial. We all recognize that the Fund is a great \r\nasset, not only for the beneficiary countries but also for \r\nthe work of the Council.\r\nAs in the past, the Human Rights Council made a \r\nseries of recommendations to the General Assembly, \r\nwhich 1 will present in a more detailed way in my \r\npresentation to the Third Committee this afternoon. For \r\ninstance, the resolution adopted on the human rights \r\nsituation in Syria at our thirtieth session recommends \r\nthat the General Assembly should submit the reports of \r\nthe International Independent Commission of Inquiry \r\non Syria to the Security Council for appropriate action. \r\nFurthermore, the Council requested the General \r\nAssembly to consider holding a high-level segment on \r\nthe right to development during the general debate at its \r\nseventy-first session.\r\nIn view of the upcoming fifteenth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the Durban Declaration and Programme \r\nof Action, the Council also requested the General \r\nAssembly, in its resolution 30/16, to dedicate a theme \r\nat the high-level segment of the seventy-first session to \r\nthe full and effective implementation of the Declaration \r\nand Programme of Action, including, among other \r\nthings, the universal ratification of the International \r\nConvention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial \r\nDiscrimination. Furthermore, the Secretary-General \r\nwas requested, through the General Assembly, to \r\n15-36749 5/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nreview and rescind the mandate of the independent \r\neminent experts for the successful implementation of \r\nthe Durban Declaration and Programme of Action and, \r\nin lieu of that mandate, to establish a forum on people \r\nof African descent.\r\nThis year, the Council also mandated a panel \r\ndiscussion on the progress made and challenges in \r\naddressing human rights issues in the context of efforts \r\nto end the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030. The report of \r\nthat discussion will be brought to the attention of the \r\nGeneral Assembly ahead of the high-level meeting on \r\nHIV/AIDS in 2016. Finally, the Council recommended \r\nthat the General Assembly designate 9 December as the \r\nInternational Day of Commemoration and Dignity of \r\nthe Victims of Genocide.\r\nSince our Fifth Committee colleagues are today \r\ndiscussing the budget for human rights activities, I would \r\nlike to touch on the significant challenges facing the \r\nHuman Rights Council in terms of resources. As I said \r\nearlier, the Council continues to adopt a high number \r\nof resolutions and decisions with significant resource \r\nimplications. Resources are also of great importance \r\nfor the work of the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nof Human Rights with regard to capacity-building \r\nand technical cooperation. Unfortunately, the regular \r\nbudget has not kept pace with that growth. For example, \r\nthe High Commissioner and his Office often have to \r\nrely on voluntary contributions in order to implement \r\nmandated activities. However, a strong and independent \r\nHigh Commissioner and Office are and will continue to \r\nbe in our common interest. I would therefore like to \r\nseek cooperation and support from all Member States \r\nto address that issue through the Fifth Committee, by \r\npositively considering options on how to address the \r\nfunding gap, including with regard to new mandates \r\narising from resolutions and decisions of the Council.\r\nI have held the presidency since January 2015 \r\nand will conclude my term at the end of this year. \r\nOn 7 December, the Council is expected to hold its \r\norganizational meeting to appoint the new Bureau for \r\nthe tenth cycle. The presidency from January 2016 \r\nonwards will come from the Group of Asia-Pacific \r\nStates. Throughout its existence for the past nine years, \r\nthe Council has proved able to devise new formats \r\nand modalities for addressing human rights issues of \r\nconcern. That was also the case this year. During the \r\nJune session, the Council held an enhanced interactive \r\ndialogue on the human rights of migrants and a \r\ndialogue on the current status of negotiations on the \r\npost-2015 development agenda with regard to human \r\nrights. Informal conversations on topical issues were \r\norganized, outside Council sessions, with the incoming \r\nChair of the Third Committee, the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the High Commissioner. Those formats, \r\nalong with the regular updates at the beginning of \r\neach Council session by the High Commissioner on \r\ndevelopments in the world and the numerous reports \r\npresented by his Office, have fruitfully contributed to \r\nthe Council’s deliberations during the calendar year.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to assure members of my \r\ncommitment to seeing a successful transition of the \r\nPresidency. I trust that the General Assembly will \r\ncontinue to provide its full support to the Council. On \r\nbehalf of my successor, I would like to welcome all \r\nmembers to the thirty-first session of the Council in \r\nMarch 2015. Finally, I would like to echo the words of \r\nformer Secretary-General Kofi Annan:\r\n“We will not enjoy development without \r\nsecurity, we will not enjoy security without \r\ndevelopment, and we will not enjoy either without \r\nrespect for human rights”.\r\nWe should — in the seventieth year of the United \r\nNations — wholeheartedly endorse those three pillars \r\nof the United Nations in all our work, and we should \r\nwork to strengthen the human rights system.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): On \r\nbehalf of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), I \r\nwould like to express the Movement’s sympathy to the \r\nfamilies of the victims of the attacks committed by \r\nDaesh terrorist groups during the past 10 days in Paris, \r\nBeirut and Baghdad. The Movement strongly condemns \r\nthose terrorist attacks and extends its condolences to \r\nthe Governments and the people of France, Lebanon \r\nand Iraq. Those terrorist attacks prove once again that \r\nterrorism and violent extremism are global threats and \r\nthat combating them requires global cooperation.\r\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries \r\nreaffirms that democracy, development and respect for \r\nall human rights and freedoms are interdependent and \r\nmutually reinforcing. The international community \r\nshould support the strengthening and promotion of \r\ndemocracy, development and respect for all human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms in the entire world, \r\nwithout distinction between developed and developing \r\ncountries. In that regard, we recall the commitments \r\nmade by the Heads of States and Government during \r\nthe various summits of the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\n6/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nWe also reaffirm that all human rights, in particular \r\nthe right to development, are universal, inalienable, \r\ninterdependent, indivisible and interrelated, and that \r\nhuman rights issues must be addressed within the global \r\ncontext through a constructive, non-confrontational, \r\nnon-politicized, non-selective, impartial, transparent \r\nand dialogue-based approach. They should also be \r\naddressed in a fair and equitable manner, with objectivity \r\nand respect for all of the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. They include respect \r\nfor the guiding principles of national sovereignty, \r\nterritorial integrity, non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States, and the right to self-determination of \r\nall peoples under foreign occupation and colonial or \r\nalien domination, while also considering the political, \r\nhistorical, social, religious and cultural particularities \r\nof each country.\r\nThe Movement stresses the need to preserve the \r\npositive developments achieved since the establishment \r\nof the Human Rights Council in the context of its \r\nwork, including its institution-building package. \r\nFurthermore, NAM reaffirms the need to ensure that \r\nhuman rights are not used for political purposes, for \r\nadopting politically motivated decisions or for avoiding \r\ndealing with the problems that plagued the former \r\nUnited Nations Commission on Human Rights. The \r\nMovement also recalls General Assembly resolution \r\n62/155, which in its paragraph 11\r\n“[u]rges all actors on the international scene to \r\nbuild an international order based on inclusion, \r\njustice, equality and equity, human dignity, mutual \r\nunderstanding and promotion of and respect for \r\ncultural diversity and universal human rights, and \r\nto reject all doctrines of exclusion based on racism, \r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance”.\r\nThe Movement emphasizes the role of the Human \r\nRights Council as a subsidiary body of the General \r\nAssembly that is responsible for considering human \r\nrights situations in all countries in the context of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review and in a spirit of cooperation \r\nand constructive dialogue. In that regard, the Movement \r\nexpresses its deep concern at the continuing and \r\nexpanding practice involving the selective adoption \r\nof country-specific resolutions in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. That practice exploits human rights for \r\npolitical purposes and contravenes the principles \r\nof universality, objectivity and non-selectivity in \r\naddressing human rights issues, which undermines \r\ncooperation as an essential principle in the effective \r\npromotion and protection of all universally recognized \r\nhuman rights.\r\nIn conclusion, the Movement calls on all States \r\nmembers of the Human Rights Council to promote \r\ninternational cooperation and constructive dialogue in \r\nthe Council, and to prevent the application of double \r\nstandards, selectivity and political manipulation, which \r\ndiscredited the United Nations Commission on Human \r\nRights.\r\nMr. Minah (Sierra Leone): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of the Group of African States. At the \r\noutset, let me say that our thoughts and prayers are with \r\nthe citizens of Paris and Beirut in connection with the \r\nrecent terrorist atrocities. We pray for all those who \r\ncontinue to suffer from terrorist acts around the world.\r\nI welcome the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Mr. Joachim Rücker, Permanent Representative \r\nof Germany to the United Nations in Geneva, and \r\nalso thank him for the introductory remarks that he \r\nmade during his presentation of the annual report of \r\nthe Human Rights Council to the General Assembly \r\n(A/70/53). The African Group thanks Ambassador \r\nRücker for his work since 1 January 2015 and for the \r\nlevel of professionalism and engagement that he has \r\ncontinuously maintained. In that regard, the African \r\nGroup would like to make the following points on the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council since its previous \r\nannual report.\r\nAs it approaches the tenth anniversary of its \r\ncreation, the Human Rights Council continues to fulfil \r\nits mandate as a subsidiary body of the General Assembly \r\nin a promising manner and in accordance with  resolution \r\n60/251 and as further elaborated and framed in the \r\nCouncil’s resolution 5/1, entitled “Institution-building \r\nof the Human Rights Council”. The Council continues \r\nto expand its work and activities, which underscores the \r\nneed for comprehensive rationalization so as to ensure \r\nefficiency and effectiveness.\r\nThe African Group appreciates the efforts of the \r\nincumbent President of the Council to address the \r\nareas with the potential to increase the efficiency \r\nof the Council’s work. In that regard, we welcome \r\nthe adoption of the statement by the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council on enhancing the efficiency of \r\nthe Human Rights Council (A/HRC/PRST/29/1) and the \r\nsubsequent follow-up decision (A/HRC/DEC/30/115). \r\nWe emphasize that any proposals for consolidating \r\n15-36749 7/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nthe working methods or increasing efficiency should \r\nbe made within the established parameters of the \r\ninstitution-building package (Human Rights Council \r\nresolution 5/1), the outcome of the review, the rules of \r\nprocedure and the existing modalities of work. We also \r\nreiterate that the Bureau of the Human Rights Council \r\nshould be guided by and must work within the framework \r\noutlined in paragraph 114 of the institution-building \r\npackage, which clarifies that the Bureau’s role should \r\nbe confined to organizational and procedural matters.\r\nWe express our concern over a number of attempts \r\nto depart from the institution-building package or \r\nto initiate a de facto review. We believe that those \r\nattempts can have grave and negative consequences for \r\nthe credibility and future of the Human Rights Council. \r\nThe same concerns also apply to the disconcerting \r\nattempts to question the status of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil as a subsidiary body of the General Assembly, \r\nor to reopen the discussion on previously settled key \r\ninstitutional questions.\r\nAs we approach the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRight to Development (resolution 41/128) in 2016, we \r\nnote with great concern the continued impasse in the \r\nintergovernmental Working Group on the Right to \r\nDevelopment and the repeated resistance to pursuing \r\nthe normative elaboration of the definition of that right. \r\nSadly, that is hampering the serious work needed to \r\nensure that that important right becomes a concrete and \r\ntangible reality for everyone, particularly the world’s \r\npoor.\r\nThe African Group welcomes the recommendation \r\nof the Human Rights Council that requests the High \r\nCommissioner, as part of the activities to commemorate \r\nthe thirtieth anniversary of the Council, to seek the \r\nviews of members in preparing a paper on the realization \r\nand implementation of the right to development, as \r\nelaborated in the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRight to Development. It also welcomes the decision to \r\nsubmit that paper to the Working Group on the Right \r\nto Development for consideration at its seventeenth \r\nsession, and it requests that the General Assembly \r\nconsider holding a high-level segment on the right to \r\ndevelopment during the general debate at its seventy-\r\nfirst session.\r\nDuring the period covered by the report, the \r\nAfrican Group within the Human Rights Council \r\ncontinued to assume its active and constructive role, \r\nincluding focusing the spotlight on a number of issues \r\nand priorities to which it attaches particular importance. \r\nThe African Group maintains its leadership on a range \r\nof issues, including the elimination of female genital \r\nmutilation, the impact of toxic waste on human rights \r\nand the effects of the non-repatriation of illicit funds on \r\nthe enjoyment of human rights.\r\nAs a backdrop to the growing number of instances \r\nof racial violence and hatred in various regions of the \r\nworld, the African Group remains at the forefront of the \r\nfight against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia \r\nand other forms of related intolerance through its \r\npresentation of ambitious and practical resolutions \r\naimed at the full implementation of the Durban \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action.\r\nIn that context, we must highlight the fact that the \r\nAfrican Group has been very supportive and engaged \r\nwith item 10 of the programme of work of the Human \r\nRights Council, entitled “Technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building”. The African States comprise two \r\nthirds of the beneficiaries of that agenda item, and that \r\nis an indicator of the degree of openness that Africa \r\nmaintains towards promoting technical cooperation \r\nand capacity-building in the field of human rights. We \r\ntake this opportunity to ensure that item 10 will remain \r\na platform for technical cooperation and capacity-\r\nbuilding. It should not be used for other objectives, such \r\nas monitoring or investigation. Advisory services on \r\nhuman rights issues should be implemented only at the \r\nrequest of the State concerned, based on its priorities, \r\nnational ownership and with full respect for the State’s \r\nsovereignty and political independence.\r\nWe are very encouraged that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil remains seized of the issue of the protection of \r\nthe family. More than 20 years after the International \r\nYear of the Family, protection and support for the \r\nfamily as a natural and fundamental unit of society \r\nremain largely overlooked, although they represent \r\nan uncontested obligation under international human \r\nrights law. The African Group welcomes the adoption \r\nof Human Rights Council resolution 29/22 and looks \r\nforward to the report on the impact of the fulfilment of \r\nStates’ obligations under international human rights law \r\nregarding the protection of the family to be submitted \r\nto the thirty-first session of the Council.\r\nWe take note of the fact that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil held an enhanced interactive dialogue during \r\nits June session on the human rights of migrants. \r\n8/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nNevertheless, the grave situation witnessed by migrants, \r\nrefugees and asylum-seekers invites further work \r\nand efforts by the Council in that regard, particularly \r\nconcerning the impact of migration and border-control \r\npolicies on the safety, dignity and human rights of \r\nmigrants and refugees. The African Group reiterates \r\nits commitment to continued support for the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council as a subsidiary body of \r\nthe General Assembly and its role in supporting the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights globally.\r\nThe African Group is convinced that the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review (UPR) remains the most distinctive \r\nmechanism of universal application for assisting States \r\nin fulfilling their human rights obligations. In our \r\nview, the mechanism remains relevant to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. The Group would \r\nlike to reaffirm the need to preserve the mechanism’s \r\ncooperative nature and the principle of dialogue. \r\nThe Group firmly believes that it is critical that the \r\nVoluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance \r\nfor the implementation of UPR recommendations be \r\nproperly used for the purpose of assisting States develop \r\nnational capacity and expertise for the implementation \r\nof the accepted recommendations.\r\nWhile the African Group reiterates its support \r\nfor the mechanisms and the special procedures of the \r\nCouncil and the important work that it undertakes \r\nin the promotion and protection of human rights, the \r\nGroup believes that there is a need for such mechanisms \r\nand special procedures to be streamlined in order for \r\nthem to be more effective. The Group would like to \r\nemphasize the need for the procedures to comply with \r\nthe institution-building package, the code of conduct \r\nfor mandate-holders and the terms of reference of their \r\nrespective mandates.\r\nThe African Group reiterates its strong concern \r\nover attempts to impose new notions and concepts, \r\nsuch as sexual orientation and gender identity, which \r\nare not referenced in international human rights law, \r\nand strongly rejects any attempts to undermine the \r\ninternational human rights system by seeking to impose \r\nconcepts pertaining to social matters, including private \r\nindividual conduct, that fall outside the internationally \r\nagreed human rights legal framework. Focusing on \r\nnotions on which there is no international agreement, \r\ndefinition or consensus will serve only to divide the \r\nHuman Rights Council and undermine its balanced and \r\negalitarian approach to the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights for all.\r\nThe Group therefore observes with regret that \r\nconcepts not universally agreed on are given attention \r\nto the detriment of issues of paramount importance, \r\nsuch as the right to development and the racism agenda. \r\nOur alarm stems not only from concerns about the lack \r\nof legal grounds or the fact that such concepts delve \r\ninto matters that essentially fall within the domestic \r\njurisdiction of States, but from the fact that such \r\nattempts also run counter to the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which calls for respect for the sovereignty of \r\nStates and the principle of non-intervention. We believe \r\nthat people are not inherently vulnerable, but that some \r\nindividuals and groups find themselves in vulnerable \r\nsituations owing to a number of factors. Such factors \r\ninclude the socioeconomic environment in which they \r\nlive. We strongly deplore all forms of stereotyping, \r\nstigmatization, prejudice, intolerance, discrimination \r\nand violence directed against peoples, communities \r\nand individuals on any grounds whatsoever, wherever \r\nthey may occur. We call on all Member States to \r\nrefrain from attempting to give priority to the rights \r\nof certain individuals, which could result in negative \r\ndiscrimination at the expense of the other internationally \r\nagreed rights.\r\nIn conclusion, the African Group is convinced that \r\nthe principles underpinning the creation of the Human \r\nRights Council, as outlined in resolution 60/251, remain \r\nof utmost importance and relevance. The Human \r\nRights Council, in undertaking its mandate aimed at \r\npromoting universal respect for the protection of human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms without distinction, \r\nshould continue to base its activities on the principles \r\nof non-politicization, non-selectivity, objectivity, \r\nuniversality, the elimination of double standards \r\nand international cooperation in addressing human \r\nrights issues. The Human Rights Council should also \r\nremain committed to the principles of interrelatedness, \r\ninterdependence and the indivisibility of all human \r\nrights, including the right to development, bearing in \r\nmind that all human rights should receive equal and fair \r\ntreatment.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the European Union.\r\nMr. Vrailas (European Union) (spoke in French): \r\nAt the outset, allow me to turn to my French colleagues \r\nand friends to express how deeply shocked and \r\nsaddened we are by the terror attacks in Paris. France \r\nis a great and strong nation. Its values of freedom, \r\nequality and brotherhood have inspired and continue \r\n15-36749 9/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nto inspire the European Union (EU). Today, we stand \r\nunited with the Government and the people of France. \r\nI also wish to extend sincere condolences to the other \r\ncountries whose nationals were also among the victims \r\nof the terrorist attacks and to our colleagues in Iraq \r\nand Lebanon regarding the attacks on the capitals of \r\nthose countries last week. We must recognize that such \r\nattacks are attacks on us all.\r\nThis is, regrettably, the second time this year that \r\nI am addressing the Assembly just after a terrorist \r\nattack. The first occurred in January in Paris. At that \r\ntime, I spoke about upholding the right to the freedom \r\nof expression, even when an opinion given could hurt, \r\nanger or insult someone else. What freedoms are we \r\ndefending today? Is it the right to attend a football \r\nmatch, listen to music, go for a walk or to a restaurant? \r\nOf what crimes were the victims of last week’s attacks \r\nguilty?\r\nIt is for that reason that we must spare no effort and \r\nwork together to ensure that such reprehensible acts do \r\nnot achieve their goal of creating divisions and sowing \r\nfear and hatred. We must face the threat together, \r\nwith all the means necessary and with unwavering \r\ndetermination. We urgently need to understand the \r\nthreat posed and ensure that the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the values, ideals and principles therein \r\nguide the way. Good always overcomes evil, and we \r\nmust make every effort to ensure that that remains true.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nEuropean Union. The candidate countries Turkey, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro \r\nand Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; the European Free Trade Association \r\ncountry Iceland, member of the European Economic \r\nArea; as well as Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova and \r\nGeorgia, align themselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Joachim \r\nRücker, for presenting the Council’s tenth annual \r\nreport to the General Assembly (A/70/53). We also \r\nappreciate the opportunity to engage in an interactive \r\ndialogue with the President of the Council in the Third \r\nCommittee in order to strengthen the links between the \r\nCouncil and the wider United Nations membership in \r\nNew York.\r\nSince the establishment of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the European Union has been a strong \r\nsupporter of that body. We would like to reaffirm our \r\ncontinued support today. Being the only United Nations \r\nbody that is purely devoted to supporting the promotion \r\nand protection of all human rights, the Council has \r\nstrengthened the ability of the United Nations to help \r\nensure that all persons can enjoy their human rights and \r\nthat violations thereof are disclosed. We attach great \r\nimportance to both the credibility and the effectiveness \r\nof the Council, and will continue to make every effort to \r\nensure that it is not only able to address violations and \r\nabuses of human rights, including gross and systematic \r\nviolations and abuses, and respond promptly to human \r\nrights emergencies, but also to improve human rights \r\nstandards and their implementation worldwide through \r\nsystematic work on relevant thematic issues. In that \r\ncontext, we strongly oppose any attempts to undermine \r\nthe institutional position of the Council within the \r\nUnited Nations system, and the European Union \r\nstresses the importance of its independence.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the central role \r\nplayed by the Human Rights Council in addressing \r\nhuman rights situations throughout the world. The \r\nsevere consequences of the crisis in Syria and the \r\nviolations committed by the Al-Assad regime cannot \r\nbe ignored by any State, and the conflict’s effects have \r\nalso become blatantly visible in the region and beyond. \r\nIn that context, the Council’s ongoing response to the \r\ncrisis remains critically important. The Council has also \r\ndemonstrated its commitment to providing technical \r\nassistance and capacity-building to the Governments of \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, Iraq, Libya and Mali in order to promote \r\nhuman rights, and we welcome the continued support \r\nthat has been rendered to the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, including East Jerusalem, the Republic of \r\nGuinea, South Sudan and Ukraine. We trust that the \r\nCouncil will continue to closely monitor situations \r\nwhere technical assistance and capacity-building can \r\nmake a difference, and will take action where necessary.\r\nOn 28 October, the General Assembly elected \r\n18 new members of the Council. Serving as a Council \r\nmember entails important responsibilities; resolution \r\n60/251 provides that members elected to the Council \r\nshall uphold the highest standards in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. While we congratulate \r\nthe new members, we also encourage all to pay careful \r\nattention to the human rights records and commitments \r\nof States throughout their membership.\r\n10/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nThe European Union highly values the work of \r\nthe special procedures. They play a crucial role in \r\nadvancing the human rights agenda. All EU member \r\nStates have extended a standing invitation to the \r\nspecial-procedures mandate-holders, and the European \r\nUnion calls on all States Members of the United Nations \r\nto do likewise and to actively cooperate with them. In \r\norder to enable them to fully carry out their mandates, \r\nit is crucial that they be able to independently assess \r\nand draw the Council’s attention to human rights issues \r\nand situations. In that regard, the EU also welcomes \r\nthe growing participation of mandate-holders in the \r\nCouncil’s work.\r\nGiven the situation in the countries concerned, \r\nthe European Union welcomes the extensions of the \r\ncountry-specific mandates of the Special Rapporteurs \r\non the situation of human rights in Myanmar, Iran, \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, Cambodia \r\nand Belarus. We also welcome the extension of the \r\nmandates of the Independent Experts on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in Haiti, the Central African Republic and \r\nMali. We also note the first report (A/HRC/29/42) of \r\nthe commission of inquiry on human rights in Eritrea. \r\nFinally, we welcome the consensus Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 30/1, on Sri Lanka, an important \r\nstep in pursuing reconciliation and accountability there.\r\nThematic special procedures play an equally \r\nimportant role through their research, country-\r\nspecific visits and valuable contributions to the better \r\nunderstanding of the content of specific human rights. \r\nAmong the many thematic special procedures, the \r\nEuropean Union would like to highlight the mandate \r\nof the Special Rapporteur on the freedom of religion or \r\nbelief, who plays an active role in identifying existing \r\nand emerging obstacles to the enjoyment of the right \r\nto the freedom of religion or belief and in presenting \r\nrecommendations to overcome such obstacles. \r\nMoreover, we also want to draw attention to the newly \r\nestablished mandate of the Independent Expert on the \r\nenjoyment of human rights by persons with albinism \r\nand the mandate on the right to privacy in the digital \r\nage. We wish them success and reiterate our support to \r\ntheir mandates.\r\nThe European Union remains strongly committed \r\nto the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a truly \r\nuniversal and unique mechanism within the United \r\nNations, addressing all human rights and applicable to \r\nall Member States without distinction or discrimination. \r\nUltimately, however, the quality of the recommendations \r\nand the commitment to implementing them are key \r\nto the outcome of that process. The equal treatment \r\nof all countries is an underlying element of the UPR \r\nmechanism and should be maintained throughout each \r\ncycle.\r\nThe European Union reiterates its strongest \r\ncondemnation of the acts of reprisal and intimidation \r\nof civil-society representatives attending the Human \r\nRights Council and cooperating with human rights \r\nmechanisms and the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights. Following the \r\ndecision of the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth \r\nsession not to defer consideration of Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 24/24, we call on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to appoint a focal point for reprisals, taking \r\ninto consideration the concerns raised by some States \r\non some of the provisions in the resolution. That was \r\nthe will of a cross-regional group of 56 States, including \r\nthe 28 EU member States, expressed in a joint statement \r\nduring the thirtieth session of the Council. We remain \r\nready to engage with all Member States to identify a \r\nsolution to the issue. Contributions by civil-society \r\norganizations and national human rights institutions \r\nare extremely valuable to the work of the Council. Their \r\nability to interact with the Council must be preserved.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate our ongoing \r\ncommitment to contributing to the work of the Human \r\nRights Council and to further strengthening its role \r\nin the protection and development of international \r\nhuman rights law. We will continue to systematically \r\nuphold and ensure the implementation of existing \r\ninternational norms and standards, strongly advocate \r\nfor the universality of human rights and promote \r\nthe observance by all States of all human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms.\r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The tragedy in Paris is yet another example of \r\nthe savagery of the terrorism that is threatening human \r\ncivilization. In Lebanon and Iraq, terrorist attacks have \r\nalso claimed the lives of many people in recent days. \r\nOur country is among those that have experienced the \r\nhorror of international terrorism at first hand. We join \r\nothers in expressing our condolences and once again \r\nstate the need to decisively and cohesively combat that \r\nheinous scourge, which knows no nationality, religion \r\nor borders. Terrorism violates human rights, including \r\nthe most basic of them — the right to life. To effectively \r\ncombat that evil, we must truly bring together the \r\nefforts of the entire international community.\r\n15-36749 11/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nWe thank Mr. Rücker for presenting the report on \r\nthe work of the United Nations Human Rights Council in \r\n2015 (A/70/53). We also congratulate the representatives \r\nof the 18 countries elected on 28 October to the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nWe view the Council as a key component of the \r\nuniversal system for promoting and protecting human \r\nrights. It is designed to promote the development of \r\nconstructive intergovernmental dialogue on human \r\nrights. Russia actively participates in the Council’s \r\nwork, cooperating with all interested States, as well \r\nas with the special-procedures mandate-holders of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and the Universal Periodic \r\nReview mechanism. We will continue to strengthen the \r\nactivity of the Council, in accordance with the principle \r\nof respectful and depoliticized cooperation, which is \r\nthe only effective way to achieve the goal of universal \r\nrespect for human rights.\r\nThis year, the Council addressed a wide range of \r\nissues. It is important that the Council’s resolutions, \r\nits President’s statements and joint country statements \r\naddressed such topics as the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the end of the Second World War, the protection of \r\nChristians, the protection of the family and the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption and fortieth anniversary of \r\nthe entry into force of the International Covenants on \r\nHuman Rights.\r\nAt the same time, in our opinion, there are many \r\nother issues that require the urgent attention of the \r\nCouncil, including violations of the rights of national \r\nminorities and the phenomenon of mass statelessness \r\non the European continent. Against a backdrop of \r\nincomprehensible phobias, several States have started \r\nrepressing all dissent by bringing pressure to bear on \r\nthe media, closing television channels and blacklisting \r\njournalists. The Council must focus its attention on \r\nthe negative practice of the use of extraterritoriality \r\nto shirk international human rights responsibilities. \r\nMore attention should be paid to ensuring social, \r\neconomic and cultural rights, the promotion of the \r\nright to development and to strengthening the system \r\nof international legal guarantees of non-interference in \r\nprivate and family life.\r\nUnfortunately, the Human Rights Council is not \r\ndoing enough to combat racism, racial discrimination, \r\naggressive nationalism, xenophobia and related \r\nintolerance or the glorification of Nazism and the spread \r\nof radical ideologies of hatred. We believe that the \r\nCouncil must give significantly more attention to those \r\nissues and that States should adopt a more constructive \r\napproach to their consideration. We are particularly \r\nconcerned about the growing politicization of the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council and the polarization of \r\nits members’ interests. The ongoing efforts of several \r\ncountries to act as mentors is not conducive to the \r\ncreation of an atmosphere of constructive cooperation \r\nin the Council, which is necessary for its effective \r\nwork. As a result, it is significantly more difficult for \r\nthe Council to hold focused and objective discussions \r\non current issues on the international human rights \r\nagenda.\r\nIt is well understood that the primary responsibility \r\nfor the promotion and protection of human rights lies with \r\nStates, while the task of the international community is \r\nto assist them in that endeavour. We believe that the \r\nhuman rights situation in certain countries should be \r\nexamined in the Council with a view to those countries \r\nreceiving advisory services, technical assistance or \r\ncapacity-building. At the same time, we must strictly \r\nadhere to the basic principle that technical assistance, \r\nfirst and foremost, must be provided only at the request \r\nof the State concerned. We believe that the work of the \r\nCouncil in the area of technical assistance must be in \r\nline with the requirements of neutrality, impartiality \r\nand independence.\r\nRussia supports the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism, which, in our opinion, is the only objective \r\ninternational human rights monitoring mechanism. We \r\nwould like to urge all States that have already completed \r\nor will complete this process in future to work in a spirit \r\nof openness, voluntary cooperation and willingness to \r\nengage in dialogue. They should not avoid taking on \r\ncommitments to implement the recommendations and \r\nshould take responsibility for their implementation. \r\nOwing to the increase in recent years in the number \r\nof the Council’s special procedures, we must focus on \r\neliminating the duplication of efforts and on strictly \r\nabiding by the mandates assigned to the procedures and \r\nby the code of conduct.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to again encourage \r\nStates and other interested parties to avoid any further \r\npoliticization or geographical or thematic distortion of \r\nthe Council’s work and not to use the Council to solve \r\nproblems that are unrelated to its mandates. We call \r\non all concerned to work with the Council in a spirit \r\nof equal and mutually respectful and constructive \r\ncooperation. We are ready to contribute to this work.\r\n12/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nMr. Ndong Ella (Gabon) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation associates itself with the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Sierra Leone on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States.\r\nAt the outset, I should like, on behalf of my country \r\nand my own behalf, to express my sincere condolences \r\nto France and the French people, especially the families \r\nof the victims, following the savage attacks committed \r\nin Paris, Île-de-France, on Friday. Gabon strongly \r\ncondemns those despicable acts of another age, which \r\nabsolutely nothing can justify.\r\nI welcome the presence in the Hall of Mr. Joachim \r\nRücker, Permanent Representative of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany to the United Nations Office at \r\nGeneva and President of the Human Rights Council. I \r\nwant to thank him for the relevant information he has \r\nkindly provided to us on the Council’s activities and \r\ncongratulate him on the excellent work he has carried \r\nout at the head of the Council at a time when the world is \r\nfacing multiple crises, which often cause multifaceted \r\nhuman rights violations.\r\nSince I had the privilege of presiding over the \r\nimportant Human Rights Council on behalf of my \r\ncountry, Gabon, I understand the scope and complexity \r\nof the tasks assigned to him, and I can fully appreciate \r\nhis activities and initiatives aimed at enhancing \r\nthe credibility and effectiveness of the Council in \r\ncontinuing the efforts of his predecessors. I welcome \r\nthe special attention he has given to strengthening the \r\nsynergy that must exist between Geneva and New York \r\nwhen addressing the issues and concerns related to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights throughout \r\nthe world. That synergy is all the more necessary as it \r\ncan serve as a foundation for greater coordination in \r\nthe implementation of the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nGabon believes that respect for human rights and \r\nthe dignity of the human person is a prerequisite for \r\nharmonious development, based on the well-being of \r\nall people, regardless of gender, religion, political \r\nopinion, ethnicity and social status. As the Assembly \r\nwell knows, the dignity of the human person exists \r\nregardless of whether or not it is recognized. My \r\ndelegation encourages the Human Rights Council to \r\nremain seized of situations that threaten the exercise \r\nand enjoyment of human rights, such as discrimination \r\nin all its forms and in particular racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia and discrimination against women.\r\nGabon has been closely following the Council’s \r\nconsideration of current issues and situations, such \r\nas those related to private life in the age of digital \r\ntechnology, family, sustainable development, migration \r\nand climate change. My delegation encourages the \r\nCouncil to strengthen its efforts in the field of technical \r\nassistance and capacity-building in human rights. The \r\ncountries listed in the Council’s agenda as needing \r\nsuch strengthening must be supported with a view to \r\nenabling them to eventually improve their human rights \r\nsituations. To that end, my delegation welcomes the \r\nproposals of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights to increase the number of staff in \r\nthe field.\r\nMy country’s Government, in line with the vision \r\nof His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President \r\nof the Republic and Head of State, who wants to \r\nmake Gabon an emerging country by 2025, regards \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights as an \r\nongoing endeavour that requires the involvement \r\nof all stakeholders and the strong cooperation of our \r\nStates, together with all United Nations human rights \r\nmechanisms, in particular the Council. Gabon, an \r\noriginal member of the Council since its establishment \r\nin 2006, has always complied with the requirements of \r\nthose mechanisms. We encourage other States to do the \r\nsame.\r\nThe reform of the working methods of the Human \r\nRights Council is particularly meaningful today, as we \r\nwill celebrate the tenth anniversary of its establishment \r\nnext year, in 2016. This reform process could begin with \r\na review of the Council’s agenda, which has become \r\nsomewhat congested over the years. Other aspects \r\nthat also might receive attention include the human \r\nrights dimension in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), which brings hope to \r\ndeveloping countries that face many challenges. As the \r\nthirtieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration \r\non the Right to Development (resolution 41/128) \r\napproaches in 2016, Gabon expresses its support for \r\nthe intergovernmental Working Group on the Right to \r\nDevelopment and hopes that it will fully carry out its \r\nmandate.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm my country’s \r\nsupport for the activities of the Human Rights Council, \r\nin accordance with resolution 65/251. The promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nmust take into account the principles of objectivity, \r\nuniversality, non-politicization, non-selectivity and \r\n15-36749 13/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nindivisibility, which are the basis for the values of \r\nhumanism, solidarity, social justice and respect for life \r\nand human dignity.\r\nMs. Wilson (Australia): I would like to start by \r\nacknowledging the horrific attacks in Paris last Friday \r\nnight, just days after the tragic attacks in Beirut and \r\nBaghdad. We offer our deep condolences to the families \r\nof those killed, and strongly condemn such acts of \r\nterror.\r\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nremains the cornerstone of the international \r\ncommunity’s human rights framework. Australia was \r\na founding Member of the United Nations, and since \r\nthe 1940s has consistently supported the central role of \r\nhuman rights as enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. We commend the Human Rights Council \r\nfor its important work in promoting and protecting \r\nall human rights, and we have actively engaged with \r\nthe Council as a non-member since its establishment \r\nin 2006. We also participate constructively in the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR) process, which we \r\nconsider to be a critical element of the United Nations \r\nhuman rights machinery and of our own human rights \r\nadvocacy. Last Monday, Australia was reviewed by 104 \r\nUnited Nations Members as part of our second cycle \r\nUPR. We take the Universal Periodic Review seriously \r\nand will over the next few months genuinely consider \r\neach recommendation.\r\nWe remain a champion of the promotion and \r\nprotection of human international rights. Australia’s \r\nForeign Minister has announced our candidacy for \r\nmembership in the Human Rights Council for a two-\r\nyear term from 2018 to 2020, the first time Australia \r\nhas sought a seat on the Council.\r\nAustralia continues to focus on five pillars in the \r\nhuman rights field: advancing the rights of women \r\nand girls; promoting good governance and strong \r\ndemocratic institutions everywhere; promoting and \r\nprotecting freedom of expression; advancing the rights \r\nof indigenous peoples; and promoting strong national \r\nhuman rights institutions and capacity-building. \r\nThose pillars reflect our priorities at home and \r\nabroad. They are issues for which we have long been \r\nan advocate domestically, in our international human \r\nrights engagements and through our aid programme \r\ncommitments.\r\nAs home to one of the world’s oldest continuous \r\ncivilizations, we are proud of the culture and heritage \r\nof Australia’s first peoples. Consistent with our \r\nindigenous peoples strategy, Australia is committed to \r\ngiving practical effect to the outcome document of the \r\nWorld Conference on Indigenous Peoples (resolution \r\n69/2) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights \r\nof Indigenous Peoples. We engage in Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolutions on the rights of indigenous peoples \r\nand look forward to considering how the Expert \r\nMechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples can be \r\nstrengthened.\r\nInternationally, we give high priority to advancing \r\nthe rights of women and girls and have placed gender \r\nequality and women’s empowerment at the centre of \r\nour aid programme. We are committed to working \r\ncollaboratively with other States to achieve equality \r\nbefore the law for women and girls, reduce violence \r\nagainst women and promote gender equality.\r\nAustralia’s leadership promotes strong, effective \r\nand independent national human rights institutions, the \r\nindependence of judges and lawyers, good governance \r\nwith respective groups, and the responsibility to \r\nprotect. Australia is also a strong advocate for the \r\nglobal abolition of the death penalty. We continue to \r\nencourage States to move away from this inhumane \r\nform of punishment. Australia has long emphasized \r\nthat there is no evidence of its value as a deterrent \r\nand that any miscarriage of its use is irreversible. In \r\nthat regard, we were pleased to see the Human Rights \r\nCouncil adopt resolution 30/5, on the death penalty.\r\nAustralia will continue to support efforts to \r\nimprove the efficiency and effectiveness of the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council, including through \r\nthe biennialization of resolutions and enhanced \r\ncoordination between New York and Geneva. We also \r\ncontinue to value the important role that the Office \r\nof the High Commissioner for Human Rights plays in \r\nfacilitating the work of the Council, assisting special \r\nprocedures and providing technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building. Australia strongly supports the \r\nindependence of the Office of the High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights and the work it does in the field, \r\nparticularly in our region.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Like others, I \r\nwould like to express our deepest sympathy for the \r\nvictims of the terrorist attacks in Paris last Friday. We \r\nstand in full solidarity with the Government and the \r\npeople of France, as well as with other Governments \r\nthat have recently been affected by terrorist attacks, \r\nparticularly those of Lebanon and Iraq.\r\n14/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nI would like to thank the President of the Human \r\nRights Council for presenting its annual report (A/70/53). \r\nA dynamic relationship between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, since both organs are entrusted with \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights, is highly \r\nimportant. Regular communication and coordination \r\nare thus essential. We appreciate President Rücker’s \r\nregular visits to New York and hope that his successor \r\nwill follow his example. My comments today will focus \r\non some of the Council’s most important achievements \r\nduring the reporting period.\r\nThe Council’s decision to support national \r\naccountability efforts in Sri Lanka for crimes \r\ncommitted during the civil war was an important signal \r\nfor survivors there. It also illustrated the Council’s role \r\nin promoting accountability for gross and systematic \r\nhuman rights violations, particularly when carried out \r\nas attacks on civilian populations. National judiciaries \r\nalways have the primary responsibility to investigate and \r\nprosecute. International criminal justice, particularly \r\nin the form of the International Criminal Court, comes \r\ninto play only when domestic efforts fail or are not \r\neven attempted. The proposed hybrid mechanism, \r\nunder national leadership but with an international \r\ncomponent, requires a strong commitment on the part \r\nof the Government of Sri Lanka to bringing justice to \r\nthe victims of the war and strengthening its judiciary \r\nin a sustainable manner. It also requires the continued \r\nengagement of the Human Rights Council, since this \r\nwill be a lengthy and possibly difficult process. In \r\nthat regard, we would like to commend the leadership \r\ndisplayed on the issue by High Commissioner Zeid \r\nRa’ad Al Hussein.\r\nAccountability for the worst types of crimes \r\nunder international law is important, but we should \r\nnever delude ourselves into believing that there can \r\nbe genuine compensation for such crimes. Preventing \r\nthem from occurring in the first place is our real duty \r\nand challenge. We therefore welcome the fact that 106 \r\nStates have subscribed to the code of conduct regarding \r\nSecurity Council action against genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity, or war crimes. We look forward \r\nto seeing more States make this important political \r\ncommitment, which we will use as a yardstick in \r\ndeciding which countries we would like to see serve \r\non the Security Council and also on the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. The code of conduct is now also ready to \r\nbe applied with respect to Burundi, which will be its \r\nfirst major challenge. In that respect, we welcome the \r\nSecurity Council’s consensus adoption of resolution \r\n2248 (2015) on the situation in that country.\r\nIn July, the Human Rights Council appointed the \r\nfirst-ever Special Rapporteur on the right to privacy. \r\nSafeguarding privacy in the digital era is one of the big \r\nhuman rights challenges of our time. It is also an area \r\nwhere the Human Rights Council can have a real impact, \r\nin particular by helping to clarify where to draw the \r\nline for States that interfere with the right to privacy. \r\nClearly, the mere fact that the rapid development of \r\ninformation and communications technology has made \r\nit easier than ever to collect personal data is not sufficient \r\nreason to lower our standards of protection. Digital \r\nsurveillance can play a useful role in law enforcement, \r\nbut it must at all times respect proportionality and \r\nbe subject to judicial review, including remedies for \r\naffected individuals. That should also be a key message \r\nfor the review of the outcome document of the World \r\nSummit on the Information Society Forum and its \r\nimplementation. Human rights must be protected \r\nonline and offline. The International Covenant on \r\nCivil and Political Rights requires that we extend such \r\nprotection, without discrimination based on nationality \r\nor citizenship, and that States respect those rights and \r\nnot interfere with them, whether in their own territory, \r\nabroad or in cyberspace.\r\nThe Council has continued to make progress on \r\nthe question of the death penalty. In particular, the \r\nrecently adopted Human Rights Council resolution 30/5 \r\naddresses the relationship between the death penalty \r\nand the absolute prohibition of torture and of inhuman, \r\ndegrading or cruel treatment or punishment. On that \r\nquestion, in the Human Rights Council report of 16 July \r\n2015, the Secretary-General clearly states:\r\n“In the light of the evolution of international human \r\nrights law and jurisprudence and State practice, the \r\nimposition of the death penalty is incompatible \r\nwith ... the prohibition of torture or other cruel, \r\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.” \r\n(A/HRC/30/18, para. 55)\r\nOn the issue of torture, the Special Rapporteur found \r\nno categorical evidence on the methods of execution \r\ncurrently in use that comply with the prohibition in every \r\ncase. The Council and the General Assembly should be \r\nable to follow that logic to make similar statements in \r\nthe future. There may be no full international consensus \r\non the death penalty, but we are strongly encouraged by \r\nthe steady positive trend towards abolition worldwide.\r\n15-36749 15/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to raise the issue of \r\nHuman Rights Council resolution 24/24, adopted in \r\n2013, in paragraph 9 of which the Council encourages \r\nStates\r\n“to address acts of intimidation and reprisal against \r\nindividuals and groups who cooperate or have \r\ncooperated with the United Nations”.\r\nThe resolution still awaits implementation, despite \r\nthe fact that there are no longer any legal or practical \r\nobstacles to it. Threats to human rights defenders \r\nworldwide are increasing at an alarming pace. Those \r\ncourageous individuals provide a key contribution \r\nto one of the three pillars of the United Nations. The \r\nOrganization therefore has both a self-interest and a \r\nmoral duty to help protect them. Human Rights Council \r\nresolution 24/24 must therefore be implemented without \r\nany further delay and in a manner that finds the widest \r\npossible political support.\r\nMs. Yparraguirre (Philippines): At the outset, \r\nallow me to convey the profound sympathies of the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Philippines to the \r\nGovernments and the peoples of Iraq, Lebanon and \r\nFrance in the aftermath of the horrific terrorist attacks \r\nperpetrated in recent weeks against innocent civilians \r\nin Iraq, Lebanon and France, whose rights to life, liberty \r\nand security of person, as enshrined in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, have been violated. We \r\nstand in solidarity with the peoples of Iraq, Lebanon and \r\nFrance and all other affected countries in condemning \r\nthose attacks and in fighting this scourge.\r\nThe Philippines thanks the President of the Human \r\nRights Council for his briefing and welcomes the latest \r\nreport on the work of the Council (A/70/53). I wish to \r\nexpress my country’s strong support for his efforts to \r\nenhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the Council.\r\nTwo weeks ago, my country received the honour of \r\nbeing elected for another term, the 2016-2018 term, as a \r\nmember of the Council. We appreciate the opportunity \r\nto serve on the Council once more, and we pledge to \r\ncontinue to actively participate in its work in a spirit of \r\nconstructive engagement and cooperation and with the \r\naim of upholding international human rights standards. \r\nThe Philippines has traditionally sponsored initiatives \r\nin the Human Rights Council on the protection of the \r\nhuman rights of vulnerable groups, such as migrants, \r\nwomen, indigenous peoples and persons with \r\ndisabilities, and we continued to do so in the period \r\ncovered by the report.\r\nThe Philippines was a principal sponsor of Human \r\nRights Council resolution 29/15 on human rights and \r\nclimate change, which calls for a study on the impact \r\nof climate change and the full enjoyment of the human \r\nright to health and decides to incorporate a panel \r\ndiscussion on the issue in the programme of work for \r\nthe thirty-first session of the Human Rights Council. \r\nWe will continue to work with partner countries in this \r\nvery important area with a view to creating a stronger \r\nsense of urgency for a human rights-based approach \r\nto dealing with climate change. We would like to see \r\nthe Council consider how the international community \r\ncan respond to the calls of the people and communities \r\nwhose lives and livelihoods are at risk and who may \r\nbe forced to leave their homes and migrate, owing to \r\nclimate-change-related events or disasters.\r\nAs Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum, a group \r\nof 20 countries that are most vulnerable to climate \r\nchange, and as one of the most disaster-prone countries \r\nin the world, the Philippines places importance on \r\ncontinually raising the awareness of the international \r\ncommunity on the very real and damaging impacts \r\nof climate change, the effects of which cut across the \r\nissues of human rights, migration, health, education \r\nand labour, among others.\r\nOn the Universal Periodic Review regional \r\nconsultations, the Philippines presented Human \r\nRights Council resolution 30/14 on the contribution of \r\nparliaments to the work of the Human Rights Council \r\nand its Universal Periodic Review. The resolution calls \r\nfor convening a panel discussion during the thirty-\r\nsecond session of the Human Rights Council to take \r\nstock of the contribution of parliaments to the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council and its Universal Periodic \r\nReview and to identify ways to further enhance their \r\ncontributions. In that regard, the Asia-Pacific regional \r\nconsultation among parliamentarians was spearheaded \r\nby the Philippine Senate in Manila in February this \r\nyear.\r\nThe Philippines strongly supports the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We firmly believe that it is a very useful \r\ntool for effecting real change on the ground, as it \r\nencourages all Member States to engage constructively \r\nand to work towards improving the human rights \r\nsituation in a country, based on its national priorities \r\nand international obligations and commitments. The \r\nPhilippines believes that there is a need for a sharper \r\nfocus on providing international support for capacity-\r\n16/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nbuilding to enable countries to better implement their \r\naccepted recommendations.\r\nIn conclusion, the Philippines will continue to \r\nsupport and actively engage in the important work \r\nof the Human Rights Council and support its role as \r\na venue for genuine and constructive dialogue, with a \r\nparticular focus on capacity-building and international \r\ncooperation.\r\nMr. Sukhee (Mongolia): At the outset, let me \r\nexpress our deepest condolences to the families of the \r\nvictims of those terrorist attacks committed in Paris \r\nlast Friday. As His Excellency Mr. Elbegdorj Tsakhia, \r\nPresident of Mongolia, stated last Friday night, “We \r\nstand united with the people of France, and we have no \r\ndoubt that France will prevail.”\r\nPlease allow me to express my Government’s deep \r\ngratitude for the valuable support extended to Mongolia \r\non 28 October when, for the first time, it was elected \r\nto the Human Rights Council, for the term 2016-2018. \r\nMongolia will do its utmost to uphold the trust invested \r\nin it and help to advance the cause of promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights around the world. I would also \r\nlike to take this opportunity to thank the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council for introducing the \r\nannual report (A/70/53) of the Council. My delegation \r\ncommends the efforts of the Council, which is a key \r\nplatform for constructive dialogue and cooperation to \r\npromote human rights throughout the world. Its current \r\nreport reveals a realistic picture of current human rights \r\nviolations and challenges worldwide and recommends \r\npossible ways and instruments to defend human \r\nrights, liberty, equality and dignity while combating \r\nintolerance, discrimination and violence.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights is \r\none of the main pillars of Mongolia’s foreign policy. We \r\nrecognize the centrality of human rights in sustainable \r\ndevelopment planning and acknowledge that human \r\nrights, the rule of law and democratic governance are \r\nall interlinked and mutually reinforcing. Mongolia \r\nwill continue to promote the issues of human rights \r\neducation; gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen; the rights of the child, the elderly and persons \r\nwith disabilities; the fight against human trafficking; \r\nand the abolition of the death penalty.\r\nWe appreciate the importance of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review (UPR) process because it gives all \r\nMember States an equal opportunity to bring their \r\nhuman rights situation to the attention of that important \r\nbody, share lessons learned and good practices and \r\ndiscuss challenges in the implementation of human \r\nrights obligations. The second national report of \r\nMongolia under the UPR was discussed constructively \r\nin May and was received positively by the UPR \r\nWorking Group, which welcomed Mongolia’s efforts \r\nto implement the recommendations made during \r\nthe first UPR review. The Working Group made 164 \r\nrecommendations, out of which the Government of \r\nMongolia accepted 150. Currently, the Government is \r\nworking on the development of the plan of action to \r\nimplement the UPR recommendations.\r\nMongolia has consistently supported the work and \r\nactivities conducted under the special procedures of the \r\nCouncil, and standing invitations were extended by the \r\nGovernment of Mongolia to all mandate-holders in 2004. \r\nSince then, Mongolia has received the visits of eight \r\nmandate-holders, including the Special Rapporteurs on \r\nthe right to food, on the right to education, on torture, \r\non extreme poverty and on human rights, and also the \r\nWorking Group on business and human rights.\r\nMongolia appreciates the importance of the work \r\nof the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights and notes the increasing demand \r\nfor the Office’s support and activities. Since 2014, \r\nMongolia has been making modest voluntary financial \r\ncontributions to the High Commissioner’s Office. \r\nAs one of the three pillars of the United Nations, the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights should be \r\nstrengthened, and the work of the High Commissioner’s \r\nOffice for advancing human rights globally should not \r\nbe held back by financial difficulties.\r\nMongolia believes that human rights are essential \r\nto achieving sustainable development. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \r\noffers us critical opportunities to further advance the \r\nachievement of human rights for all people everywhere \r\nand without discrimination.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my \r\nGovernment’s full commitment to contributing to the \r\nCouncil’s activities during its membership, including \r\nthrough the voluntary pledges and commitments made \r\nunder resolution 60/251. At the international level, \r\nMongolia will continue to support the principles of \r\nnon-selectivity, universality and the indivisibility \r\nof human rights and will work to ensure the full \r\nenjoyment of human rights, including civil, political, \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights and the right to \r\n15-36749 17/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\ndevelopment. At the national level, Mongolia will \r\npursue the comprehensive implementation of its \r\ninternational obligations on human rights and enhance \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights through \r\nexpanded collaboration with all stakeholders.\r\nMs. Al-Nasrallah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation condemns the cowardly terrorist attacks \r\nin France, Lebanon and Iraq, attacks that call for the \r\ninternational community to combat international \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations.\r\nToday, the General Assembly is discussing one of \r\nthe most important items on its agenda. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for its report (A/70/53), which outlines the \r\nCouncil’s recent work aimed at promoting human \r\nrights at the international level and consolidating and \r\nprotecting human rights. We would also like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nJoachim Rücker. The report covers numerous issues \r\nrelating to human rights and their protection and to \r\nfundamental human freedoms. Moreover, it addresses \r\nthe issue of human rights in a number of countries and \r\nfocuses on the role of international organizations and \r\non strengthening cooperation throughout the world. \r\nIt also deals with such important issues as human \r\ntrafficking, the human rights of people with disabilities \r\nand the stepping up of efforts to eliminate all forms \r\nof intolerance, discrimination and violence against \r\nwomen.\r\nThe report also includes the outcome of Kuwait’s \r\nsecond Universal Periodic Review (UPR) of Kuwait, \r\nwhich requires the full cooperation of all members of \r\nthe international community. Since the endorsement \r\nof its second UPR in January, the State of Kuwait \r\nhas made great efforts to implement the outcome of \r\nthat review. In its entirety, the review included 278 \r\nrecommendations, 178 of which were accepted, because \r\nthey were in line with the Constitution of the State of \r\nKuwait. Kuwait duly noted 25 other recommendations, \r\nand four recommendations were partially accepted. I \r\nwould like to announce that my country has endorsed \r\na bill to establish, pursuant to the Paris Principles, a \r\nnational institution with competence to promote and \r\nprotect human rights and disseminate human-rights \r\nnorms.\r\nMy country has established a committee for the \r\ndefence of human rights in the National Assembly. It has \r\nalso established public agencies to combat corruption and \r\nconduct oversight of labour in all sectors. Undoubtedly, \r\nthe concept of human rights is directly connected with \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, which is due to the \r\nfact that the progress of countries can be measured in \r\nterms of the extent to which they have complied with \r\ntheir human rights obligations. Also, the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations calls for the promotion of human rights \r\nand the protection of fundamental freedoms.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has offered a wide range of \r\nhumanitarian assistance through intergovernmental \r\nand non-governmental organizations, including the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights. We firmly believe in the need to \r\npromote international peace and security and respect \r\nfor human rights. Against that backdrop, the State of \r\nKuwait has hosted three international conferences in \r\nsupport of the humanitarian situation in Syria and to \r\nalleviate the suffering of the Syrian people, in line with \r\nreport of the Independent International Commission of \r\nInquiry on the Syrian Arab Republic (A/HRC/30/48). \r\nAccordingly, my delegation supported Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 29/16, on the continuing grave \r\ndeterioration of the human rights and humanitarian \r\nsituation in Syria.\r\nAs we are discussing the question of human \r\nrights, we call for respect for the human rights of the \r\nindividual. We would like to strongly condemn the \r\ncontinuing brutal practices of Israel, the occupying \r\nPower, and its breach of the basic human rights of the \r\nhelpless Palestinian people in the occupied territories. \r\nIsrael must be forced to comply with its obligations \r\nunder international human rights law. In that regard, \r\nwe support all the relevant resolutions of the Human \r\nRights Council referred to in the report.\r\nIn conclusion, despite the efforts undertaken by the \r\nState of Kuwait and the achievements made in the area \r\nof human rights at the national and international levels, \r\nour responsibilities with respect to this issue make it \r\nimperative that we continue our efforts to overcome all \r\ndifficulties and challenges so that we can benefit from \r\nthe body of international experience and expertise in \r\nour drive to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1).\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt): Egypt aligns itself with \r\nthe statements made by the representative of Sierra \r\nLeone, on behalf of the Group of African States, and \r\nby the representative of the Islamic Republic of Iran, \r\non behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\n18/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nAt the outset, I would also like to welcome \r\nAmbassador Joachim Rücker, Permanent Representative \r\nof Germany to the United Nations Office in Geneva \r\nand current President of the Human Rights Council. \r\nThe delegation of Egypt would like to thank President \r\nRücker for his presentation today of the annual report \r\nof the Human Rights Council (A/70/53), as well as to \r\ncongratulate him on the dedicated and tireless efforts \r\nhe has made during his presidency of the Council.\r\nOur meeting today comes in the wake of the \r\nabhorrent terrorist attacks in France, Egypt, Beirut and \r\nmany other places around the world, which resulted in \r\nthe loss of scores of innocent lives and have shocked \r\nthe conscience of the international community. The \r\ndark plague of terrorism and extremism is emerging as \r\na fundamental challenge for the global community and \r\npresents an insurmountable obstacle to the enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms, particularly \r\nwith regard to the right to life and personal security. We \r\nwelcome the adoption by the Human Rights Council of \r\nits resolution 28/17, on the effects of terrorism on human \r\nrights, and we urge the Council to stand united behind \r\nthe timely and critical message it conveys, namely, \r\ncondemning all acts of terrorism wherever they occur \r\nand by whomever they are perpetrated and considering \r\nthe devastating impact of terrorism on the enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nNext year marks the tenth anniversary of the Human \r\nRights Council. Since its inception, the Council’s \r\npivotal mandate has been to promote and protect human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms globally. However, \r\nthat mandate cannot be implemented effectively \r\nunless it is applied in accordance with the principles \r\nof non-politicization, non-selectivity, objectivity, \r\nuniversality and international cooperation, and within \r\nthe framework of a genuine intergovernmental dialogue \r\non human rights issues. The unprecedented challenges \r\nthat ensuring universal respect for human rights is \r\nbeing subjected to will inevitably require expansion in \r\nthe work and activities of the Human Rights Council \r\nand result in increased pressures on its resources and \r\nprogramme of work.\r\nEgypt firmly supports enhancing the efficiency of \r\nthe work of the Council in that regard. We welcome \r\nthe adoption of A/HRC/PRST/29/1, on enhancing \r\nthe efficiency of the Human Rights Council, and the \r\nsubsequent follow-up decision, A/HRC/DEC/30/115. \r\nEgypt also recalls the commitments set forth in the \r\nVienna Declaration and Programme of Action in favour \r\nof the universality, indivisibility, interrelatedness and \r\ninterdependence of all civil, cultural, economic, political \r\nand social rights, including the right to development, \r\nand in support of the principle that all human rights \r\nshould be treated in a fair and equitable manner, with \r\nthe same emphasis and on an equal footing.\r\nNext year marks the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations Declaration on the Right to Development. \r\nWe consider that occasion to be an opportune moment \r\nto step up the efforts of the United Nations and the \r\ninternational human rights community to realize the \r\nright to development and further elaborate its normative \r\ncontent, including by formulating measurable criteria \r\nand sub-criteria towards its implementation. We also \r\nlook forward to the contributions that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil can make in supporting the global partnership \r\nin efforts to implement the new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nThe eradication of poverty and the realization of \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights are undoubtedly at \r\nthe heart of the new global development charter. We \r\nare encouraged by the Council’s efforts to adequately \r\naddress the challenges standing in the way of the \r\nattainment of economic, social and cultural rights. In \r\nthat regard, we note with great appreciation the Council’s \r\nadoption of its resolution 28/15, on the right to work. \r\nIn that resolution, which Egypt sponsored, the Council \r\naffirmed that decent work and full and productive \r\nemployment were an integral part of achieving human \r\nrights and leading a dignified life.\r\nWe are pleased to see that the Human Rights Council \r\ncontinues to actively engage on issues of racism, \r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and other related \r\nforms of intolerance, including religious intolerance, \r\nstigmatization and discrimination and violence on the \r\nbasis of religion and belief. It is a matter for concern \r\nthat we still witness recurring and alarming instances of \r\nsuch violations, especially in the context of political and \r\nelectoral propaganda and the media, including social \r\nmedia. This situation requires firm and immediate \r\naction and the full and effective implementation of the \r\nDurban Declaration and Programme of Action. The \r\nissue is all the more pressing as a result of the refugee \r\nand asylum-seeker crisis that is currently unfolding. \r\nIn that regard, we urge the Human Rights Council to \r\ndevote more attention to the human rights of migrants.\r\nMy delegation congratulates the Human Rights \r\nCouncil on the adoption of its resolution 29/22, on \r\n15-36749 19/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nprotection of the family, which was led by Egypt and \r\na cross-regional core group. By adopting an ambitious \r\nand substantively comprehensive text by a comfortable \r\nmajority, the Human Rights Council reaffirmed States’ \r\nobligations under international human rights law to \r\nprovide effective protection for the family as the natural \r\nand fundamental unit of society. We look forward to the \r\nrelevant report being presented by the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights next March.\r\nOn the other hand, we remain concerned by attempts \r\nto impose new controversial notions and concepts that \r\nhave no basis in international human rights law. That \r\napproach could seriously undermine the universality \r\nof human rights as well as the credibility of the \r\ninternational human rights system.\r\nI conclude by reiterating Egypt’s continued \r\nsupport for the work of the Human Rights Council, as \r\na subsidiary body of the General Assembly, and for its \r\nimportant role in promoting global respect for human \r\nrights.\r\nMr. Kaluđerović (Montenegro): Montenegro fully \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered on behalf of \r\nthe European Union.\r\nLet me begin by offering my deepest condolences to \r\nthe victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris and Lebanon. \r\nThose tragic events remind us of the importance of \r\nadditionally strengthening the Human Rights Council \r\nand other human rights mechanisms and of joining our \r\nefforts in tackling terrorism and violent extremism.\r\nMy delegation would like to thank the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council, Ambassador Joachim \r\nRücker, for presenting the annual report of the Human \r\nRights Council (A/70/53) to the General Assembly. We \r\nappreciate this opportunity to discuss the achievements \r\nof the Human Rights Council in 2015, bearing in mind \r\nin particular that this is the last year of our membership \r\nin that body. I would like to pay particular tribute to \r\nAmbassador Rücker for the way in which he discharged \r\nhis duties as President of the Council during its ninth \r\nyear, and for his personal engagement in developing \r\na set of responses to the non-negligible challenge \r\nof improving the Council’s working methods. That \r\nincluded a retreat hosted earlier this year in Berlin, \r\nwhich truly helped in developing fruitful ideas on how \r\nto additionally strengthen the Geneva human rights \r\nsystem.\r\nThe realization of human rights is crucial to \r\npreserving democracy and freedom. It is essential to \r\nachieving the great objective of the United Nations, \r\nnamely, the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. The struggle to uphold human rights is waged \r\non behalf of the people who suffer injustice and seek \r\nredress or who are victims of merciless conduct by \r\nviolent extremists and violations of international human \r\nrights and humanitarian law.\r\nAs can be learned from the report before us today, \r\nthe Human Rights Council has demonstrated its \r\nability to contribute to human rights protection efforts \r\naround the globe. The Council has continued to tackle \r\nsensitive issues, deal with many difficult and complex \r\nhuman rights situations and bridge differences between \r\npolitically, ideologically and culturally different States \r\nthat share a common goal of combating a sometimes \r\nshocking degree of dereliction of duty and abuse of \r\nhuman rights. In addition to its regular sessions, the \r\nspecial one held on Boko Haram has confirmed that the \r\nCouncil’s activities are closely tied to today’s extreme \r\nchallenges.\r\nAllow me to express our satisfaction that this year \r\nthe Council adopted two important resolutions for which \r\nMontenegro was a part of the core group. One is aimed \r\nat combating the harmful practice of child, early and \r\nforced marriage, in order to prevent children, men and \r\nparticularly women from being left on the margins of \r\nsociety. The other is designed to help the Government of \r\nSri Lanka to negotiate the country’s difficult processes \r\nof reconciliation and post-conflict transition. Indeed, \r\nwe believe we are right in stating that this resolution \r\nreflects in miniature the larger objective of the Council, \r\nnamely, bringing together the collective efforts of the \r\ninternational community and the political will of a \r\nGovernment with a view to enabling citizens who have \r\nborne significant suffering in the past to enjoy a more \r\npeaceful, secure and dignified life.\r\nI turn now to the Human Rights Council’s special \r\nprocedures. This mechanism has proved to be a central \r\ntool for independent and impartial insight into the \r\nhuman rights situation from a thematic or country-\r\nspecific perspective. We would like to pay tribute to \r\nthe expertise of the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which, \r\nduring the course of the year, continued to bring to \r\nthe Council’s attention alleged violations or abuse, to \r\nconduct thematic studies and to provide appropriate \r\nadvice for technical assistance to countries in need.\r\nIn addition, we must be aware that any initiative \r\nthat would assign a subsidiary role to the OHCHR in \r\n20/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nrelation to the Council would be counterproductive for \r\nthe independence of the OHCHR. Rather, we should \r\nfurther strengthen the Council and the OHCHR by \r\nfinding a way of making the two bodies more sensitive \r\nto each other’s recommendations, and by advocating \r\nfor a more sensitive approach when deciding on the \r\nfinancial means needed for their complementary and \r\nindependent duties. In that regard, we will continue to \r\nadvocate for the Human Rights Council and OHCHR \r\nto be provided, in future, with adequate resources to \r\nconduct their important duties.\r\nWe must pay sincere tribute to the Universal Periodic \r\nReview mechanism, which continues to be an important \r\nincentive for improving the human rights situation in \r\nthe countries under review. As the third cycle is about \r\nto start, the success and results of the implementation \r\nphase will determine the efficiency and ultimate \r\ncredibility of the mechanism and will demonstrate \r\nthe extent of States’ engagement in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. Montenegro pays a \r\ngreat deal of attention to the mechanism and recently \r\nsubmitted its mid-term report on the implementation of \r\nthe recommendations received during the second cycle. \r\nWe are also in the process of developing a national \r\nmechanism to follow up the recommendations received \r\nby way of the special procedures and treaty bodies.\r\nAs the Human Rights Council approaches its \r\ntenth anniversary, we often ask ourselves whether \r\nwe have built an appropriate and credible mechanism \r\nto cope with the continuing new challenges that face \r\nthe international community. It is difficult to assess \r\nresults, given the daily gross violations of human rights \r\nfor which perpetrators are often not held accountable \r\nand given the violent extremism and terrorism that are \r\nbent on disrupting the struggle for peace and security.\r\nSyria’s citizens continue to bear enormous pain \r\nowing to the conflict. Many have been forced to f lee \r\ntheir homes, possibly becoming victims of trafficking \r\nand smuggling. A large percentage of the citizens \r\nlive in hunger and poverty. Women still do not enjoy \r\nthe same rights as men and continue to face harsh \r\nforms of discrimination. Some Governments continue \r\ninexorably to ignore the international community’s \r\nappeals to improve the human rights situation. That \r\nattitude usually goes hand in hand with a narrow civil-\r\nsociety space in which human rights defenders face \r\nincreasing intimidation and harassment.\r\nIt is also unfortunate that in every part of the world \r\ndifference continues to be perceived as dangerous to \r\nsociety rather than an enrichment. That includes the \r\nongoing violence, harassment and discrimination \r\ncarried out against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender \r\nand intersex persons. And, finally, it is terrifying that \r\nthe whole world must guard against possible activities \r\non the part of the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, \r\nBoko Haram and other terrorist and violent extremist \r\ngroups.\r\nSuch negative phenomena must not discourage \r\nthe efforts of the international community but should \r\nmake it more alert to contemporary threats and help \r\nin building a more preventive approach to human \r\nrights challenges. In that regard, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has truly achieved success in raising the level \r\nof accountability of States in human rights protection \r\nworldwide. We often underestimate the fact that the \r\nsuccess of the Council and other human rights bodies \r\nin facing contemporary challenges depends on our \r\nown readiness to use that international forum to call \r\nfor perpetrators of serious human rights violations \r\nto be brought to justice, for Governments to be held \r\naccountable to their citizens and for a proactive \r\napproach to to be taken to building a culture of respect \r\nfor human rights as the only acceptable standard.\r\nWe are the ones who need to ensure that in our \r\ninternational deliberations we extend the same corpus of \r\nrights to each individual member of society, regardless \r\nof ethnic, religious, sexual or any other affiliation. We \r\nmust also recognize and respect the important role of \r\ncivil society in the Council and on the ground. And we \r\nneed to ensure that the same goals we promote in the \r\nHuman Rights Council are mirrored within our own \r\nborders.\r\nWith that in mind, let me assure the Assembly that, \r\nupon ceasing to be a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Montenegro will continue its engagement \r\nto uphold human rights and protect the dignity of the \r\nhuman individual. We hope that our efforts in that \r\nregard, both at the national and the international level, \r\nwill win us re-election to that eminent body for the \r\nperiod 2022-2024.\r\nMs. Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, we would like to express our heartfelt \r\ncondolences and sympathy to the victims of the \r\ncriminal and terrorist attacks that took place in a \r\nnumber of neighbourhoods in the French capital of \r\nParis and claimed the lives of many people. We strongly \r\ncondemn such terrorist attacks, which run counter to \r\nall moral, humanitarian and religious values and are \r\n15-36749 21/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\naimed at the destabilization of countries and the killing \r\nof innocents. We pray for the full and speedy recovery \r\nof all of the injured victims.\r\nAllow me to express our thanks to the President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council for his briefing to the General \r\nAssembly on the work of the Council. We appreciate \r\nthe work that he has undertaken in order to ensure \r\nrespect for human rights in all countries. We endorse \r\nthe contents of his reports (A/70/53 and A/70/53/Add.1) \r\nfor their valuable and important information.\r\nMy country has supported the Human Rights Council \r\nsince its inception as the primary organ concerned \r\nwith human rights within the United Nations system. \r\nWhile we commend the Council for its impartiality, \r\nobjectivity and non-selectivity, we must make every \r\neffort to ensure that the Council continues to fulfil its \r\nfunctions in improving the standards of human rights \r\nand addressing human rights violations, including \r\nexpeditious responses to emergencies, promoting \r\nthe rights to development and education, combating \r\nviolence and putting an end to impunity. We strongly \r\noppose attempts made by other parties to undermine the \r\nCouncil’s efforts. We also commend the efforts of the \r\nCouncil to provide technical assistance and capacity-\r\nbuilding to countries so that they can fulfil their human \r\nrights obligations, as well as the Council’s growing \r\nand effective role in promoting and consolidating the \r\nculture of human rights while increasing awareness. \r\nIn that regard, we call for continuing support for the \r\nHuman Rights Council so as to enable it to continue \r\nits efforts, in view of the growing number of mandates \r\nthat have been established and that require increased \r\nresources.\r\nAdditionally, we would like to underline the \r\nimportance of the family, which is the primary \r\ncomponent of society because it contributes to \r\nbuilding societies and promoting development. I take \r\nthis opportunity to endorse the adoption of Council \r\nresolution 26/11, regarding the protection of the family, \r\nwhich is at the heart of the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. We look forward to the report that will be \r\nsubmitted in tandem with the implementation of that \r\nimportant resolution.\r\nThe State of Qatar, represented by its wise \r\nleadership, accords high priority to the respect of \r\nhuman rights in the context of the overall policy \r\nreform undertaken by our country in accordance with \r\nits comprehensive development vision, Qatar National \r\nVision 2030. The latter includes the improvement of \r\nhealth care and education, the mainstreaming of human \r\nrights in educational curricula, the promotion of human \r\nrights for women, children and persons with disabilities, \r\ncombating human trafficking and improving conditions \r\nfor foreign labourers. As a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, Qatar is committed to fulfilling its obligations \r\nin the area of human rights, safeguarding humanitarian \r\nprinciples, promoting and consolidating the concepts \r\nand culture of human rights and cooperating with the \r\nCouncil. That has been reflected in our participation \r\nin the Council in discussions regarding the second \r\nUniversal Periodic Review cycle.\r\nQatar continues to improve its record in the \r\narea of human rights, which has been substantiated \r\nby its standing invitation to all special-procedures \r\nmandate-holders. Qatar received a visit from the \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants in \r\nNovember 2013 and welcomed the visit of the Special \r\nRapporteur on the independence of judges and lawyers \r\nin January 2014. Qatar is also host to the United Nations \r\nHuman Rights Training and Documentation Centre \r\nfor South-West Asia and the Arab Region in Doha. \r\nTomorrow, on 17 November, the Third Committee will \r\nconsider the draft resolution on the United Nations \r\nCentre, and we would like to thank the sponsors of \r\nthat draft resolution, which has been submitted for the \r\nfourth time since the inception of the Centre in 2005.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to reiterate our \r\ncommitment to participating constructively and \r\nimpartially in the area of human rights and to \r\ncooperating with the relevant United Nations agencies \r\nand international organizations in line with international \r\nstandards, and especially with the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and its specialized organs and mechanisms.\r\nMr. Otepola (Nigeria): Nigeria joins other \r\ndelegations in conveying our condolences to the \r\nGovernments and the peoples of France, Iraq and \r\nLebanon, who have suffered unwarranted attacks on \r\nharmless and innocent individuals. Nigeria views those \r\nattacks as directed not only against those people, but \r\nagainst all of humankind. Our hearts are with those \r\nwho have lost loved ones and those injured during the \r\nunprovoked attacks.\r\nMy delegation warmly welcomes the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Ambassador Joachim Rücker, \r\nto New York and thanks him for the presentation of the \r\nreport of the Human Rights Council for 2015 (A/70/53).\r\n22/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries and by the representative of Sierra Leone on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States.\r\nRespect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms lies at the heart of Nigeria’s constitutional \r\ndemocracy. In that respect, we consider it important not \r\njust to ensure the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights within Nigeria, but also to uphold the tenets of \r\nthose rights. Consequently, Nigeria will continue its \r\nactive engagement with the Human Rights Council \r\nas the main organ of the United Nations charged with \r\npromoting and protecting human rights. We also want \r\nto join the President of the Human Rights Council in \r\nsaying that human rights, as one of the three pillars \r\nof the United Nations, is closely tied to the two other \r\npillars, namely, peace and security and development. \r\nWithout peace there can be no development, and \r\nwithout development, there can be no peace.\r\nHowever, it is also a fact that without human \r\nrights there would be neither peace and security nor \r\ndevelopment. The extent to which those rights mutually \r\nreinforce one another underscores the important role \r\nof the Human Rights Council in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. The activities of the \r\nCouncil during the reporting period clearly indicate \r\nthe effort that has gone into the fulfilment of its \r\nmandate. The Council’s three annual regular sessions \r\nand the various special sessions devoted to specific \r\nissues underscore the determination of the Council \r\nto address human rights issues of global concern. \r\nOne of those special sessions was on the atrocities \r\ncommitted by the terrorist group Boko Haram. We \r\nwelcome the support of the Human Rights Council in \r\nthe fight against Boko Haram — as set out in Council \r\nresolution S-23/1, reproduced in its report of 1 April \r\n2015 (A/HRC/S-23/2) — while promoting humanitarian \r\nassistance to refugees and internally displaced persons \r\nand technical assistance to the multinational joint task \r\nforce, to which Nigeria has made available the sum of \r\n$100 million for its operationalization. We would like \r\nto take this opportunity to assure the international \r\ncommunity of our firm commitment to protecting \r\nhuman rights while fighting terrorism.\r\nThe various special procedures of the Council \r\ncontinue to play a vital role in the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. The wide range of topics \r\nthey cover and handle clearly demonstrates the \r\nvariety of the issues that the Council is seized with. \r\nWe greatly appreciate their reports to the Council and \r\ntheir interactive meetings with the Third Committee. \r\nWe have demonstrated our support for the special \r\nprocedures by issuing a standing invitation to them to \r\nvisit Nigeria.\r\nWe urge that the work of the Council continue to \r\nbe guided by resolution 60/251 and solidly based on \r\nthe fundamental principles underpinning the Vienna \r\nDeclaration and Programme of Action on human rights. \r\nWhile we see the Council as a unique tool for the \r\nprotection and promotion of all human rights, whether \r\ncivil, political, economic, social or cultural, we are \r\nalso of the view that a focus on economic, social and \r\ncultural rights might be the Council’s own contribution \r\nto assisting States in attaining the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (see resolution 70/1).\r\nThe Universal Periodic Review (UPR) has so far \r\nproved to be very successful as a reliable mechanism \r\nfor addressing human rights violations. It is remarkable \r\nthat, since the first session of the Working Group on \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review in February 2008, the \r\nmechanism has attracted a high level of participation \r\nby States. The second cycle of the UPR has reinforced \r\nthe mechanism’s importance as a means of promoting \r\nand protecting human rights across the world.\r\nNigeria acknowledges the active participation \r\nof non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the \r\nactivities of the Human Rights Council. We welcome \r\nthe Council’s engagement with NGOs as a way of \r\nallowing the people’s voice to be heard, but at the same \r\ntime we hope its report will be guided by facts and \r\nobjectivity. We would also like to see the Council pay \r\ngreater attention to the human rights situation in all \r\nnon-self-governing territories, with the specific aim of \r\nholding the administering Powers to their commitment \r\nto preparing such territories for full independence.\r\nFinally, Nigeria will continue to emphasize the \r\npromotion of human rights and the protection of \r\nhuman dignity. We believe that equity and equality, \r\npractised by all, for all humankind, must be part of \r\nthe basic foundation of the activities of the Human \r\nRights Council, in accordance with universally \r\nagreed-on principles of human rights, for the benefit \r\nof the global community. In that connection, we call \r\non the international community to assist Nigeria and \r\nother countries in similar situations in their efforts to \r\nrecover and return illicit funds and stolen assets, in \r\n15-36749 23/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\norder to enable those countries to enjoy human rights \r\nfor development.\r\nMr. González Franco (Paraguay) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I would first like to express the condolences \r\nand full solidarity of the Government and the people \r\nof Paraguay to the Governments and the peoples of \r\nIraq, Lebanon and France for the terrible attacks they \r\nsuffered last week.\r\nParaguay welcomes the report on the work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council (A/70/53), presented by \r\nAmbassador Joachim Rücker, alongside whom my \r\ncountry, representing the Group of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States (GRULAC), had the honour of serving \r\nas a Vice-President of the Council. I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to thank the GRULAC States for the \r\ntrust they placed in us, as well as the President for all \r\nthe work accomplished during his tenure. Our work in \r\nthe Bureau was conducted with transparency and in a \r\nconstructive and conciliatory spirit, while respecting \r\nthe principles of universality and non-selectivity.\r\nParaguay considers the Human Rights Council \r\nto be fundamentally important not only within the \r\nUnited Nations, but in the world. Its role as the main \r\nintergovernmental body responsible for promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights cannot be overemphasized. \r\nIt is therefore essential that we remain committed to \r\nstrengthening the Council and, above all, as States, to \r\ncooperating in enabling it to carry out its duties and, \r\nwhere appropriate, providing it with the resources it \r\nneeds to perform effectively and adequately.\r\nWe emphasize the importance of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review as a mechanism that enables us \r\nto monitor the progress and the challenges that all \r\ncountries deal with in the field of human rights, and to \r\nbe monitored in our turn, and we believe that universal \r\nmechanism should be an inspiration to other United \r\nNations bodies. While we do not doubt the impact \r\nof the Universal Periodic Review on the ground, I \r\nbelieve we should strengthen compliance with its \r\nrecommendations at the national level.\r\nImplementing the human rights recommendations \r\nof that universal and regional system is a priority for \r\nmy country. For that reason and based on Paraguay’s \r\npositive experience in that area and our awareness \r\nof the responsibility that membership in the Human \r\nRights Council implies, we and Brazil led the action on \r\nthe resolution that the Council adopted at its thirtieth \r\nsession on strengthening national human rights follow-\r\nup systems and processes. That resolution aims to \r\nshare examples of best practices in implementing \r\nrecommendations, while emphasizing the need to \r\nstrengthen cooperation between the United Nations \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\nand States so as to improve countries’ institutional \r\ncapacities in the area.\r\nI would also like to highlight that, together with \r\nAlbania, Brazil, Colombia, Guatemala, Greece, Mexico, \r\nNorway, Switzerland and Uruguay, we sponsored the \r\nresolution entitled “Contribution of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to the special session of the General Assembly \r\non the world drug problem of 2016”, with the main aim \r\nof ensuring that the Council contributes a human rights \r\napproach to the discussion of the issue, especially at the \r\nspecial session of the Assembly to be held in 2016. I am \r\nalso pleased to be able to say that the Southern Common \r\nMarket, of which my country is the current President, \r\npromoted the Council’s adoption of the resolution \r\nentitled “The incompatibility between democracy and \r\nracism”.\r\nThe Republic of Paraguay reaffirms its commitment \r\nto the effective promotion and protection of human \r\nrights throughout the world. We firmly believe that \r\nthe dignity and rights of all people should be protected \r\nwithout discrimination. The Human Rights Council \r\nplays a key role in that endeavour, which is why we \r\nurge that it continue to carry out its functions with \r\nobjectivity, impartiality and universality. I therefore \r\ncall on States to continue to cooperate with the Council \r\nand to provide it with the assistance it needs to fulfil \r\nits goals.\r\nMs. Izanova (Kazakhstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nI would first like to express our deep and heartfelt \r\ncondolences to all the victims of the acts of terrorism \r\nin Paris, Baghdad and Beirut. We firmly condemn such \r\nattacks.\r\nI would like to welcome His Excellency Mr. Joachim \r\nRücker, President of the Human Rights Council, and to \r\nthank him for his presentation of the Council’s report \r\n(A/70/53).\r\nDuring the past year, Kazakhstan participated in the \r\nwork of the Council as a Vice-President, representing the \r\nAsia-Pacific Group. As a Bureau member, Kazakhstan \r\nparticipated directly in the organization of the work \r\nfor the Council’s ninth cycle. Unfortunately, the cycle \r\ntook place against the backdrop of an escalation in \r\narmed conflicts, terrorist acts and grave humanitarian \r\n24/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\ncrises. As a result, the Council’s agenda was focused \r\non issues of migration, refugees and combating \r\nterrorism. Nevertheless, during its regular sessions, \r\nthe Council also continued to work successfully on a \r\nwide range of other human rights issues, as reflected \r\nin the report. In that regard, we wish to commend the \r\nstellar professionalism of the Council’s President in \r\norganizing the work of the Council effectively, and we \r\ntake this opportunity to thank him for the joint work of \r\nthe Bureau.\r\nWe support the efforts to increase the Council’s \r\nproductivity pursuant to the adoption at the twenty-\r\nninth session of President’s statement A/HRC/\r\nPRST/29/1, on 3 July. We also support efforts to achieve \r\ncloser dialogue between the Council and the Third \r\nCommittee and to improve cooperation between those \r\nbodies. In order to increase the efficacy of both bodies, \r\nwe believe that it would be beneficial to find areas \r\nwhere duplicative practices can be eliminated.\r\nWe are convinced that the Council’s activity \r\nshould be based, first and foremost, on the principle of \r\nprotecting women and children. As a traditional sponsor \r\nof a draft resolution on that issue, Kazakhstan moved, \r\nat the March session, to include in the draft the issues \r\nof protecting children in efforts to combat violence and \r\nprevent child suicide and the use of children in armed \r\nconflict. We thank the other countries on the Council \r\nthat supported Council resolution 28/19.\r\nThe activity of the Council must be based on the \r\nprinciples of dialogue among equals and constructive \r\ncooperation. Those principles must remain fundamental \r\nin the consideration of all Council agenda items, \r\nwithout exception, including country-specific items. \r\nIn that regard, we support the consensus resolution on \r\nSri Lanka. We also support the initiatives of several \r\ncountries to further promote the right to development. \r\nIn the light of the recently adopted 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development (resolution 70/1) and the \r\nupcoming thirtieth anniversary of the Declaration on the \r\nRight to Development, the Council must pay appropriate \r\nattention to the right to development in the upcoming \r\nanniversary year. We also feel that it is essential to \r\napproach all categories of human rights — civil, \r\npolitical, economic, social and cultural — in a balanced \r\nmanner within the Council.\r\nWe wish to note separately that Kazakhstan \r\ncontinues to actively cooperate with the Council and \r\nwith its mechanisms and procedures. In just the past \r\ntwo years, our country was visited by four Special \r\nRapporteurs. Kazakhstan stresses its interest in \r\nfurthering dialogue with the Special Rapporteurs. \r\nDuring the same period, Kazakhstan presented its \r\nlatest report to the four United Nations treaty bodies, \r\ncompleted the second Universal Periodic Review cycle \r\nand ratified the international Convention on the Rights \r\nof Persons with Disabilities. We wish also to note that, \r\nbeginning in 2008, Kazakhstan has provided a yearly, \r\nvoluntary contribution to the budget of the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights.\r\nTo conclude, please allow me to wish every success \r\nto the new members of the Bureau and to express our \r\nhope that they will make a significant contribution \r\nto the promotion and protection of human rights. I \r\nwould like to reiterate Kazakhstan’s commitment to \r\nprotecting fundamental human rights and freedoms \r\nand to cooperating closely with all mechanisms of the \r\nglobal human rights system.\r\nMr. Bishnoi (India): At the outset, I offer our \r\nheartfelt condolences for the victims of the terrorist \r\nattacks in Beirut and Paris last week.\r\nWe thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for his briefing on the activities of the Council, \r\nand we welcome his report (A/70/53). I would also \r\nlike to place on record our appreciation to him for the \r\nsmooth and effective manner in which he has conducted \r\nthe deliberations of the Council.\r\nWe align ourselves with the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nThe Human Rights Council has evolved into an \r\nindispensable forum for voluntary participation and for \r\nsharing national experiences and best practices in the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development envisages\r\n“a world of universal respect for human rights and \r\nhuman dignity, the rule of law, justice, equality and \r\nnon-discrimination” (resolution 70/1, para. 8).\r\nThe clear reflection of human rights principles and \r\nstandards in the people-centred 2030 Agenda underlines \r\nthe collective political will to strive to synergize the \r\nwork of the United Nations in its three pillars of peace \r\nand security, development and human rights.\r\nThe Human Rights Council now has an even more \r\nimportant role to play. It must continue to strengthen its \r\n15-36749 25/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nadherence to the fundamental principles of universality, \r\ntransparency, impartiality, objectivity, non-selectivity \r\nand constructive international dialogue, while seeking \r\nto realize human rights for all. The Council must \r\nensure that the indivisibility, interrelatedness and \r\ninterdependence of all human rights, including the right \r\nto development, are respected and dealt with in a fair \r\nand equal manner.\r\nThe universality of human rights cannot, however, \r\nbe construed as a universality of values and systems. \r\nThe Council must bear in mind the significance \r\nof national and regional particularities and of the \r\nvarious historical, cultural and religious backgrounds \r\nof countries in its dialogues with Member States. \r\nThe unique and positive mechanism of the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review (UPR) is widely accepted and has \r\nbolstered the credibility of the institution. As we \r\napproach the third cycle of the UPR and the tenth \r\nanniversary of the Council, we need to maintain the \r\nuniversality of the mechanism and further improve its \r\nefficiency by rationalizing recommendations. We must \r\nrefrain from using it to impose specific thematic issues \r\nthat have not acquired universal acceptance. We should \r\nalso find ways to support developing countries in the \r\nimplementation of their accepted recommendations \r\nthrough capacity-building.\r\nI would like to mention that the success of \r\ndialogue with the important mechanism of special \r\nprocedures hinges on their continued independence \r\nand impartiality and on the related tasks being carried \r\nout with responsibility and sensitivity. Another concern \r\nis the Council’s continued dependence on voluntary \r\nfunding. It is clear that the Council needs to continue to \r\nrationalize its priorities to make the most efficient use \r\nof limited resources.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express our deep \r\nappreciation to the High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, Prince Zeid Ra’ad Zeid Al Hussein, and his \r\nOffice for assisting States in their efforts to promote \r\nand protect human rights. The unique role played by \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights (OHCHR) in fulfilling its mandate is \r\nunparalleled in the United Nations. At the same time, \r\nwe share the view that the inherent ambiguities in the \r\ngovernance and administrative arrangements of the \r\nOffice, including in the funding, geographical diversity \r\nof staffing and strategic planning, are hindering its \r\noptimal performance, as highlighted in the recent Joint \r\nInspection Unit review report. In that regard, we take \r\nnote of the efforts of the High Commissioner to improve \r\nefficiency and streamline the work of his Office through \r\nthe change initiative. Those efforts notwithstanding, it \r\nis important, in our view, for Member States to agree on \r\na mechanism to comprehensively address those long-\r\nstanding issues, including enhancing the transparency \r\nand accountability of OHCHR.\r\nIt is our long-held belief that human rights issues \r\ncannot be approached in isolation, which would ignore \r\nthe complex and intricate relationship between human \r\nrights, development, democracy and international \r\ncooperation. As we approach the tenth anniversary \r\nof the Human Rights Council, we must also remain \r\nmindful of the reasons for its creation and avoid \r\nrepeating past mistakes.\r\nThe Council should respect the right of each State \r\nto organize and manage its affairs, including in the \r\nfield of human rights, and guard against falling into the \r\ntrap of putting a country in the spotlight in a selective \r\nmanner and engaging in intrusive monitoring, which \r\nhas, time and again, proven to be counterproductive. \r\nThe need of the hour is to ensure that the Council \r\ncontinues to function in a non-selective, non-politicized, \r\nnon-confrontational and transparent manner. We must \r\nguarantee full respect for the core principles of Article \r\n2 of the Charter of the United Nations, namely, the \r\nsovereign equality, territorial integrity and political \r\nindependence of all States Members of the United \r\nNations.\r\nAs a member, India remains committed to making \r\nthe Human Rights Council a strong, effective and \r\nefficient body capable of promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all, so that \r\nit retains its pre-eminent place as a leading international \r\nhuman rights institution.\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland is deeply shocked and concerned by \r\nthe terrorist attacks perpetrated last week in Beirut, \r\nBaghdad and Paris. Switzerland strongly condemns \r\nthose heinous acts, which go against the fundamental \r\nvalues of any society, and assures the countries affected \r\nof its full solidarity. It expresses its deepest condolences \r\nto the families of the victims and the countries affected \r\nby that scourge.\r\nSwitzerland thanks the President of the Human \r\nRights Council for his presentation. The promotion \r\nand protection of human rights are priorities for \r\nSwitzerland. They are among its most treasured values. \r\n26/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nSwitzerland attaches paramount importance to the role \r\nof the Council and to its effectiveness, as well as to \r\nmaximizing its impact in ensuring respect for human \r\nrights throughout the world. As the host State to the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Switzerland believes that it \r\nhas a special responsibility to support the Council in \r\nachieving its objectives. Moreover, we are especially \r\npleased to have been elected to the Council for the \r\n2016-2018 term, and thus to be able to continue our \r\nmajor commitment to the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights as a full member.\r\nSwitzerland expresses its gratitude to the President \r\nof the Council and congratulates him on the exemplary \r\nmanner in which he has performed as President over the \r\npast year. In particular, we welcome the fact that, under \r\nhis presidency, priority has been given to cooperation \r\nwith civil society, to strengthening the human rights \r\npillar of the United Nations and to an element that we \r\nbelieve contributes considerably to that strengthening, \r\nnamely, improving the working methods of the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nIn the course of its sessions, the Council has \r\nsucceeded in adapting to new human rights challenges \r\nby extending the scope of its activities, both at the \r\nthematic level and in terms of country situations. That \r\nwider field of activity is clear proof of its success. But \r\nto some extent, the Council has also been a victim \r\nof its success. Having increased and diversified its \r\nactivities to such an extent, it has reached the limit \r\nof its capacities. That is why Switzerland commends \r\nthe progress made during the presidency in improving \r\nthe working methods of the Council. We welcome the \r\nfact that concrete proposals were made, and we will \r\ncontinue to support the operationalization of initiatives \r\naimed at achieving more effective and efficient working \r\nmethods.\r\nStrengthening the human rights pillar of the United \r\nNations is essential for ensuring that human rights are \r\nrespected everywhere in the world. That reinforcement \r\nis achieved by addressing more closely human-rights-\r\nrelated issues within all the bodies of the United Nations. \r\nFrom that perspective, we welcome in particular the \r\nPresident’s personal commitment to strengthening the \r\nlink between the Human Rights Council and the Third \r\nCommittee, and also with the Security Council, through \r\nhis participation in several meetings and events on this \r\nside of the Atlantic. That closer contact between Geneva \r\nand New York is helping to strengthen the human rights \r\npillar throughout the United Nations system.\r\nCivil-society actors are key partners of the United \r\nNations system. Close cooperation between them \r\nand the Council is essential for ensuring respect for \r\nhuman rights in the world. Switzerland is nevertheless \r\nconcerned about the ever-increasing number of cases \r\nof intimidation and reprisals against individual civil-\r\nsociety members, in particular those who cooperate \r\nwith United Nations mechanisms. Switzerland calls on \r\nall States Members of the United Nations to ensure the \r\nprotection of those individuals.\r\nI would like to conclude by assuring the President \r\nof the Council of Switzerland’s continued commitment \r\nto the Human Rights Council in the continuation of \r\nits essential work in protecting and promoting human \r\nrights.\r\nMr. Alday González (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation joins in condemning, in the strongest \r\npossible terms, the terrorist acts that were committed \r\nin Baghdad, Beirut and Paris recently, and expresses \r\nthe condolences of the Government and the people of \r\nMexico to the families and peoples of Iraq, Lebanon \r\nand France.\r\nMexico welcomes the report submitted by the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council (A/70/53), and \r\nthe work done by the Council at its twenty-eighth, \r\ntwenty-ninth and thirtieth sessions, as well as at the \r\ntwenty-third special session. As we have mentioned \r\non other occasions, the Council’s report provides a \r\nunique opportunity to review the main elements of its \r\nprogress, and for delegations to express their concerns \r\nwith regard to the functioning of the universal system \r\nof human rights. The Council is at the centre of that \r\nsystem, and therefore the analysis of its report will have \r\na positive and visible impact on improving the situation \r\nof human rights throughout the world.\r\nMexico wishes to stress the sound functioning of \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review mechanism, a tool that \r\nhas most likely been one of the main contributions of \r\nthe Human Rights Council. The peer-review scrutiny, \r\nwhich is carried out constructively and progressively, \r\nmust be viewed as an opportunity to improve the \r\nnational human rights situations in all Member States \r\nand allows one to avoid falling into any kind of \r\ncomplacency or deception.\r\nReflection on the functioning of the Council is a \r\nprocess that must focus on continuing improvement of \r\nthe way it works. Mexico has insisted on the importance \r\nof adopting a qualitative rather than quantitative \r\n15-36749 27/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\napproach in assessing the impact of the Council. We \r\nmust also ensure the effectiveness of its deliberations, \r\nand we say this given the proliferation of resolutions and \r\nmandates, which stands in contrast to the effectiveness \r\nof its work in the field.\r\nWe welcome the President’s statement A/HRC/PRST/29/1 \r\nand Council decision 30/115, on enhancing the efficiency \r\nof the Council, adopted this year. They will help to \r\npromote the adoption of certain initial measures that \r\nwill optimize the work of the Council by adjusting \r\nthe work timetable of the Advisory Committee in the \r\nprocess of considering the applications of those aspiring \r\nto be mandate-holders.\r\nMexico firmly maintains the right of members of \r\nthe Council to submit initiatives that will contribute to \r\nthe treatment by that body of the major topics within \r\nthe human rights field. However, Mexico emphasizes \r\nthat, in order to implement that right, the members must \r\ntake a constructive approach when submitting a draft \r\nresolution. A constructive approach in the resolutions \r\nprocess is essential so as to ensure the strengthening \r\nof international human rights. The wording of the \r\ninitiatives must seek to create a constructive and \r\nbalanced text aimed at achieving consensus among all \r\nthe views of its members. They must fundamentally \r\npromote respect for equal rights and the principles \r\nof universality, impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity, which, under its mandate, regulate the \r\nfunctioning of the Council.\r\nTen years after its establishment, the Human \r\nRights Council represents an important step forward \r\nfor the United Nations. It is time to continue improving \r\nprocedures and to begin implementing some of the \r\nmeasures discussed so as to make the work of the \r\nCouncil more effective and, above all, so that concrete \r\nresults on the ground can ensue for all individuals \r\neverywhere.\r\nMr. Hetesy (Hungary): Hungary thanks the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Mr. Joachim \r\nRücker, for presenting the annual report of the Council \r\n(A/70/53) to the General Assembly.\r\nHungary fully aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the observer of the European Union, and \r\njoins others in expressing its deepest condolences to all \r\nthe peoples and the Governments affected by the recent \r\nterrorist attacks.\r\nHungary reiterates its full and continued support \r\nfor the work of the Human Rights Council and its \r\nmechanisms. We have been an active supporter of the \r\nCouncil since its establishment, in 2006, including by \r\ntaking a leading role in introducing draft resolutions \r\non the independence of the judiciary and on the \r\nquestion of reprisals. Hungary was a member of the \r\nCouncil between 2009 and 2012, and served as one \r\nof the Vice-Presidents between 2011 and 2012. We \r\nhave presented our candidature for membership in \r\nthe Council for the period 2017-2019. We are strongly \r\ncommitted to the protection of human rights defenders \r\nand firmly believe that the participation of civil society \r\nin the work of the Council is essential. We remain \r\ndeeply concerned about continued acts of intimidation \r\nand reprisals against those who cooperate or seek to \r\ncooperate with the United Nations, its representatives \r\nand mechanisms in the field of human rights. In that \r\nregard, we welcome the actions taken by the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council to address that important \r\nissue, as he explained in his statement delivered today.\r\nWe attach great importance to the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review (UPR) and believe that, over the past \r\nseven years, the UPR has established itself as a unique \r\nand important peer-review mechanism. In our national \r\ncapacity, we have submitted our mid-term UPR report, \r\nand we are now preparing our second review, to be \r\nheld in the spring of 2016. We also strongly support \r\nthe work of the special procedures of the Council, \r\nwhich play a crucial role in advancing the human rights \r\nagenda of the United Nations. Hungary, in line with the \r\nstrong plea of the President this morning, has extended \r\na standing invitation to all human rights experts \r\nfrom the special procedures, and we will continue to \r\ncooperate with experts who have pertinent mandates by \r\nfacilitating their country visits, responding in a timely \r\nmanner to their communications and acting on their \r\nrecommendations.\r\nIn the past, we have facilitated the visits of \r\nsix different experts with human rights mandates \r\nto Hungary, and we look forward to the upcoming \r\nvisits of the United Nations Working Group on \r\nDiscrimination against Women in Law and Practice, \r\nthe Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights \r\ndefenders and the Special Rapporteur on the right to \r\nthe freedoms of peaceful assembly and association. \r\nHungary continues to host the annual Budapest Human \r\nRights Forum as part of its commitment to raise \r\nawareness about the human rights issues that are high \r\non the international community’s agenda. The eighth \r\nBudapest Human Rights Forum, held last week at the \r\nMinistry of Foreign Affairs and Trade, was dedicated \r\n28/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nto the seventieth anniversary of the United Nations and \r\nfeatured discussions about human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the participation of minorities and the \r\nuniversal periodic review.\r\nHungary attaches great importance to the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). As co-Chair of the \r\nOpen Working Group on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, Hungary worked with Member States and \r\nother stakeholders to ensure that the Goals and targets \r\nof the 2030 Agenda reflected the universality and \r\nindivisibility of all human rights. The 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development promises peaceful, just and \r\ninclusive societies that are free from fear and violence, \r\nand it incorporates important elements on democratic \r\ngovernance, the rule of law, access to justice and the \r\nprotection of fundamental freedoms. The Agenda also \r\nplaces the principles of equality and non-discrimination \r\nat the centre of sustainable development efforts. If \r\nimplemented effectively, the Agenda will go a long way \r\ntowards ensuring the fulfilment of human rights for all. \r\nWe therefore believe that the Human Rights Council \r\nand its mechanisms can also contribute to the effective \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating Hungary’s full \r\nsupport for the work of the Human Rights Council.\r\nMr. Jürgenson (Estonia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express my deepest condolences to the families \r\nof the victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris. We stand \r\nin solidarity with the Government and the people of \r\nFrance.\r\nEstonia aligns itself with the statement made by the \r\nobserver of the European Union, and we would like to \r\nmake some additional remarks in our national capacity.\r\nEstonia expresses its appreciation for the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council and to the President of \r\nthe Council, Mr. Joachim Rücker, for his presence \r\nhere today and for presenting his overview on the \r\ndevelopments of the past year.\r\nEstonia will conclude its term in the Human \r\nRights Council at the end of this year, having been a \r\nmember since 2013. We support the regular exchange \r\nof information and the efforts made to coordinate the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council and that of the \r\nThird Committee. We hope that the Council and the \r\nCommittee will support and complement each other’s \r\nwork. Furthermore, we must work on incorporating \r\nhuman rights issues consistently within the United \r\nNations framework, and also on ensuring the continued \r\neffectiveness of the Council and of the Committee to \r\ncontribute to the development and protection of human \r\nrights.\r\nDuring our term in the Human Rights Council, we \r\nhave focused on ensuring and protecting democracy, \r\nthe rule of law, good governance and fighting impunity \r\nin all forms, with emphasis on supporting the activities \r\nof the International Criminal Court. In addition, we \r\nhave stood for universal human rights, as they are a \r\nfundamental part of international institutions, as well \r\nas for improving women’s rights, advancing gender \r\nequality and eliminating gender-based violence. We \r\nhave been committed to protecting the rights of the \r\nchild, and believe that corporal punishment for children \r\nis unacceptable. We call on Member States to prohibit \r\ncorporal punishment in any form.\r\nEstonia will continue to focus on the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples and their participation in United \r\nNations forums. The importance of cultural heritage \r\nand the respect for the fundamental right of indigenous \r\npeoples to their traditional lands is a key aspect in \r\nthat regard. We are strong supporters of the active \r\nparticipation of civil-society organizations, and we \r\nvalue their contributions in the field of human rights. \r\nA strong democracy should acknowledge the role \r\nand importance of civil society while respecting its \r\nindependence and freedom.\r\nWe are deeply committed to ensuring human \r\nrights, including freedom of expression and offline and \r\nonline opinion. We believe that freedom of expression \r\nand opinion are the cornerstones of democracy and an \r\nopen society. Only democracy and the rule of law can \r\nguarantee those freedoms, along with the principle that \r\neveryone is and will be held accountable for their words \r\nand actions. Freedom of expression cannot limit the \r\nright to privacy, or vice versa.\r\nThose freedoms further include unlimited and \r\nunrestricted access to the Internet. As one of the \r\nfounding members of the Freedom Online Coalition, \r\nEstonia will continue to push for the freedom of \r\nexpression and the protection of human rights on the \r\nInternet. While the need for greater cybersecurity has \r\nbeen described as a reason for restrictions, Estonia \r\nbelieves that Internet freedom and cybersecurity are \r\nnot mutually exclusive concepts, and security is not an \r\nexcuse to limit the freedom of expression. We believe \r\nin a free and secure Internet for all.\r\n15-36749 29/30\r\n16/11/2015 A/70/PV.53\r\nIn conclusion, Estonia would like to reiterate its \r\nsupport for the work of the Human Rights Council and \r\nits mechanisms. We will continue to be committed to \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights in all \r\nforums.\r\nMr. Tesfay (Eritrea): First of all, on behalf of myself \r\nand the Government of Eritrea, I would like to express \r\nour condolences to the Governments and the people and \r\nfamilies of the victims of terrorism in France and other \r\ncountries.\r\nMy delegation wishes to welcome the President \r\nof the Human Rights Council and takes note of the \r\nCouncil’s annual report to the General Assembly \r\n(A/70/53). Eritrea believes, as has been stressed clearly \r\nand strongly on a number of occasions by the Group of \r\nAfrican States, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries \r\nand other regional groups, that the Universal Periodic \r\nReview remains a valid and appropriate mechanism for \r\nenhancing constructive dialogue and cooperation on \r\nhuman rights issues among Member States. That tool \r\nshould not be undermined by unnecessary parallel and \r\noverlapping initiatives. Article 2 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations clearly states that non-interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of States should also be a guiding \r\nprinciple for United Nations bodies, including the \r\nHuman Rights Council. The core tenets of human rights \r\nvalues are best promoted when the Council upholds the \r\nprinciples of universality, impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity, and those founding principles should \r\nbe respected and promoted at all times by all Member \r\nStates.\r\nThe report of the Human Rights Council to the \r\nAssembly reflects important work on issues that my \r\ndelegation highly values. However, it must be pointed \r\nout that my delegation rejects the proliferation of \r\ncountry-specific mandates. For example, renewing the \r\nmandates of the Special Rapporteur and the Commission \r\nof Inquiry on Eritrea is unwarranted and unnecessary. \r\nIt is a politically motivated act that does not reflect the \r\nreality on the ground in Eritrea. It also lacks context. \r\nEven development programmes, such as afforestation, \r\nwater harvesting and dam building, as well as other \r\ninfrastructural activities that were implemented with the \r\nfull participation of the people, have been deliberately \r\npresented as involving slave labour. Contrary to such \r\ndistorted assertions by the mandate-holders, there are in \r\nfact effective ways of mobilizing domestic resources for \r\nsustainable development. Eritrea should be commended \r\nand emulated — not intimidated and threatened — and \r\nits development activity must not be misrepresented.\r\nDespite the occupation of its sovereign \r\nterritory, including the town of Badme, and the \r\npolitically motivated unjust sanctions imposed on \r\nit, Eritrea — with its 50 per cent Muslim and 50 per \r\ncent Christian population; its location along a major \r\nmaritime trade route in the volatile Horn of Africa and \r\nRed Sea region; and its 1,200 kilometres of coastline \r\nand more than 350 islands — is fully committed to, and \r\nengaged in, advancing and realizing the hard-fought \r\nsocial, cultural, economic and political aspirations of \r\nits people. It is therefore appropriate to mention a few \r\nof its human rights agenda issues and achievements.\r\nThe political, social and economic rights of women \r\nare fully respected under the law. They have equal rights \r\nto own property, they are paid equally for equal work, \r\nand female genital mutilation has been criminalized. \r\nUnder the motto, “Education for All”, education is free \r\nfrom kindergarten to the tertiary level. At the tertiary \r\nand vocational levels, students are provided with free \r\nfood and lodging.\r\nIn the health sector, Eritrea has achieved \r\nMillennium Development Goals 4, 5 and 6 and has \r\nestablished a solid basis for transitioning to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1). \r\nEritrea has also been declared, by the World Health \r\nOrganization, to be a polio- and measles-free country.\r\nThe establishment of a Special Rapporteur and a \r\nCommission of Inquiry on the same issue and on the \r\nsame country, in this case Eritrea, is not only redundant, \r\nit is also a waste of time and resources that cannot \r\nbe justified or rationalized. It must be terminated. It \r\nmust be underlined that the Special Rapporteur is also \r\na member of the Commission of Inquiry. That fund \r\ncould be reallocated to the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to enhance its \r\ntechnical cooperation with Member States. Eritrea’s \r\nhumble recommendation is consistent with the appeal of \r\nthe High Commissioner to Member States to strengthen \r\nthe regular budget of the human rights body.\r\nFor the Human Rights Council to base its actions \r\non a report presented to it by two or three individuals \r\nwho collected information from faceless, nameless \r\nsources is not only procedurally wrong, it is a travesty \r\nof justice as well. It must be rejected. The Council \r\nshould not allow itself to be politically manipulated and \r\n30/30 15-36749\r\nA/70/PV.53 16/11/2015\r\nused by any group or member country, big or small, \r\nrich or poor. The Council’s main objective should be to \r\npromote human rights standards through constructive \r\nengagement and dialogue. It should not be used as an \r\ninstrument within a certain country’s sinister agenda \r\nthat has little value in improving the human rights \r\nsituation of any given country.\r\nThe Council must also provide an opportunity for \r\nthe party concerned and accused to defend itself and \r\nexplain the human rights situation in the country. The \r\ndictum that one is innocent until proven guilty must be \r\nrespected by all Member States, including the Council.\r\nI wish to appeal to the President of the Human \r\nRights Council to guide Council members to thoroughly \r\ninterrogate any justifiably established mandate-holders \r\nand deal only with issues that are verifiable and \r\ncollected from credible sources. Sweeping allegations \r\nand sensational sound bites must be avoided and \r\nchallenged.\r\nIn conclusion, we ought to remind ourselves \r\nthat, not long ago, we witnessed the termination of \r\nthe Commission on Human Rights, when some of \r\nits members used it as a political tool for threats and \r\nintimidation, mostly against developing countries. \r\nOnce again, I appeal to the President of the Human \r\nRights Council to exercise maximum vigilance in order \r\nto maintain the integrity of the Council.\r\nNobody can tell, nor has the right to tell, the \r\nEritrean or other people what to be or not to be in their \r\ncountry, and what to do or not to do. The people, and \r\nonly the people, of Eritrea are the determiners of their \r\ndestiny. What the Eritrean people need is solidarity, \r\ncooperation and engagement, not conditionality, threats \r\nand intimidation. We must also not forget that the right \r\nto development is also a human rights issue. Let us \r\npractice what we preach — nobody must be left behind.\r\nThe Eritrean Government once again reaffirms \r\nits commitment to the attainment of improved human \r\nrights standards in order to guarantee the full enjoyment \r\nof such rights by the people of Eritrea.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
