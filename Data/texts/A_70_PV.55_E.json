I think we have all been deeply \r\nsaddened, shocked and outraged by the loss of life \r\nand incredible carnage in recent weeks in many places \r\naround the world, among them Ankara and Baghdad, \r\nover the Sinai, in Beirut and, this past weekend, in Paris. \r\nWe mourn with those who have lost their friends and \r\nloved ones and those whose lives are deeply shattered \r\nor destroyed.\r\nThe disregard for human life and human dignity \r\ndisplayed by groups such as Daesh, Boko Haram, \r\nAl-Shabaab, Al-Qaida and others is a mortal threat to \r\nthe values that bring us together at the United Nations.\r\nIn these most difficult moments, when pain and grief \r\ncan so swiftly turn to anger and intolerance, we, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, must stand together, united in our \r\ncollective resolve to advance peace, justice, human \r\nrights and prosperity for all.\r\nThe world needs us to respond, but that response \r\nmust be considered. It must be comprehensive and \r\nsustained. It must, above all, seek to advance a political \r\nsolution to the conflict in Syria and, guided by a \r\ncommitment to international law, focus on addressing \r\nthe root causes of terrorism and violent extremism.\r\nIn memory of the victims and in a sign of solidarity, \r\nI would like to invite everyone in the Hall to observe a \r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a \r\nminute of silence.\r\nAgenda item 87\r\nReport of the International Atomic Energy Agency\r\nNote by the Secretary-General transmitting \r\nthe report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (A/70/219)\r\nDraft resolution (A/70/L.8)\r\nThe President: I invite Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency, to introduce the report of the Agency for the \r\nyear 2014.\r\nMr. Amano (International Atomic Energy Agency): \r\nLet me begin by expressing my horror at the appalling \r\nacts of terrorism that took place in Paris last Friday \r\nwithin hours of the dreadful attack in Beirut. On behalf \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), I \r\noffer my sympathy and support to the Governments and \r\nthe peoples of France and Lebanon.\r\nThe IAEA has had another eventful year since I \r\nlast had the honour to address the General Assembly \r\n(see A/69/PV.37). There were important developments \r\nin relation to the Iran nuclear issue. I will talk about \r\nthat in some detail in a moment, but I would first like \r\nto say that I very much welcome the adoption of the \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.55\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n55th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 17 November 2015, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nSustainable Development Goals (see resolution 70/1) by \r\nworld leaders at the General Assembly in September. \r\nThere are clear links between the new Goals and the \r\nwork of the IAEA. Areas covered by both include \r\nenergy, food security and nutrition, human health and \r\nthe protection of the oceans and management of water \r\nresources, and climate change. I am especially pleased \r\nthat there is explicit recognition in the new Goals of \r\nthe importance of science and technology in advancing \r\ndevelopment, something I have stressed in previous \r\nstatements to the Assembly. The Agency has so much \r\nto offer in that area that I often summarize our work as \r\n“atoms for peace and development”. I also welcome the \r\ninclusion of new Goals concerning non-communicable \r\ndiseases, including cancer, which is an important area \r\nof the IAEA’s work.\r\nSince I last addressed the Assembly, the IAEA \r\nhas continued to contribute effectively to the \r\ndevelopment needs of member States by transferring \r\nnuclear technology through our technical cooperation \r\nprogramme. We also demonstrated our ability to \r\nrespond quickly to crises in member States. After \r\nthe earthquake in Nepal in April, the Agency helped \r\nthe country’s authorities to test the structural safety \r\nof critical buildings such as hospitals and schools, \r\nusing non-destructive testing techniques, including \r\nradiography. Following the outbreak of Ebola in West \r\nAfrica, we provided equipment and diagnostic kits for \r\nrapid identification of the virus. We have since helped \r\ncountries of the region to build or strengthen their \r\ncapacity to respond to possible future outbreaks of \r\nEbola and other deadly diseases.\r\nThe IAEA Programme of Action for Cancer \r\nTherapy assists member States in integrating radiation \r\nmedicine into comprehensive cancer-control strategies. \r\nThe IAEA has invested nearly €300 million in cancer \r\nand radiotherapy projects throughout the world in the \r\npast few decades. Our work helps to save many lives, \r\nbut developing countries’ need for access to effective \r\ncancer treatment remains great. The inclusion of targets \r\nfor non-communicable diseases, including cancer, in \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals gives me hope that \r\nmuch more will be done to address the issue in the \r\ncoming decades.\r\nPreparations for a long-overdue renovation of the \r\nIAEA nuclear applications laboratories in Seibersdorf, \r\nnear Vienna, are well under way. The laboratories \r\ntrain scientists from all over the world, support \r\nresearch in human health, food and other areas, and \r\nprovide analytical services to national laboratories. \r\nAlmost all IAEA member States receive support from \r\nthem. The target date for completion of the first new \r\nlab, the Insect Pest Control Laboratory, is the end of \r\n2017. Construction of the second lab will begin once \r\nsufficient extrabudgetary funding is available. The \r\nlaboratories are the engine of much of the technical \r\nsupport that we provide to member States. They will \r\nconstitute an important part of the IAEA’s contribution \r\nto the achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. I thank the countries that have already provided \r\nor pledged support for the modernization project. I call \r\non all Member States in a position to do so to contribute \r\ngenerously.\r\nThis year’s IAEA Scientific Forum in September \r\nwas entitled “Atoms in Industry”. Participants \r\nconsidered the key role that nuclear technologies \r\nplay in areas ranging from the production of high-\r\nperformance materials to the control of pollutants that \r\ncause disease. At the end of the year, representatives \r\nfrom more than 190 countries will meet in Paris for the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. Many countries believe that nuclear power can \r\nhelp them to address the twin challenges of ensuring \r\nreliable energy supplies while curbing greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions. Nuclear power has a low environmental \r\nimpact and leads to significant avoidance of \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions. I believe that appropriate \r\nconsideration should be given to nuclear power in talks \r\non climate change mitigation under the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. There \r\nare now 441 nuclear-power reactors, operating in 30 \r\ncountries. Together, they provide approximately 11 per \r\ncent of the world’s electricity. There are 65 reactors \r\nunder construction, mostly in Asia. The IAEA helps \r\ncountries that choose to use nuclear power to do so \r\nsafely, securely and sustainably. \r\nIn August, I signed a host State agreement and a \r\nrelated technical agreement with the Government of \r\nKazakhstan establishing an IAEA bank of low-enriched \r\nuranium (LEU) in that country. The IAEA LEU bank is \r\na mechanism of last resort to give countries confidence \r\nthat they will be able to obtain LEU to make fuel for \r\nnuclear-power plants in case of an unforeseen disruption \r\nto supply that cannot be remedied by commercial \r\nmeans. I am grateful to Kazakhstan for hosting the \r\nIAEA LEU bank.\r\n15-37040 3/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nMy report on the 2011 Fukushima Daiichi accident \r\nwas released in September, along with five technical \r\nvolumes. I believe that that IAEA report will be the key \r\nreference document on the accident for years to come \r\nand will help to improve nuclear safety throughout the \r\nworld. Turning briefly to nuclear security, I am pleased \r\nto report that the 2005 Amendment to the Convention \r\non the Physical Protection of Nuclear Material has \r\nmoved closer to entry into force. However, accession \r\nby 13 countries is still necessary. The entry into force \r\nof the Amendment would reduce both the likelihood of \r\nterrorists being able to detonate a dirty bomb and the \r\nrisk of a terrorist attack on a nuclear installation. I ask \r\nall countries that have not yet done so to accede to this \r\nimportant nuclear security instrument as a matter of \r\nurgency. \r\nI now turn to nuclear verification. Safeguards \r\nagreements are now in force with 182 States. However, \r\n12 non-nuclear-weapon States parties have yet to meet \r\ntheir obligation under the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons to conclude a comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements with the Agency. I urge all those \r\nStates to conclude such agreements as soon as possible. \r\nI am pleased to report that the number of States with \r\nadditional protocols in force continues to increase. It \r\nnow stands at 126. That is very encouraging, because \r\nthe additional protocol is essential for the Agency to \r\nbe able to provide credible assurance that there are no \r\nundeclared nuclear material and activities in a country. \r\nThe nuclear programme of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea is a matter of serious concern. The \r\nAgency remains unable to undertake verification in \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, and our \r\nknowledge of the country’s nuclear programme is \r\ntherefore limited. Nevertheless, we have maintained our \r\nreadiness to return to the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea if requested to do so. I call on the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to comply fully with its \r\nobligations, cooperate promptly with the Agency and \r\nresolve all outstanding issues, including those that have \r\narisen during the absence of Agency inspectors from \r\nthe country.\r\nAs the Assembly will recall, in May 2011 I reported \r\nthat it was very likely that a building destroyed at the \r\nDayr al-Zour site in Syria was a nuclear reactor that \r\nshould have been declared to the Agency. The Agency \r\nhas not received any new information that would affect \r\nthat assessment. I again urge Syria to cooperate fully \r\nwith the Agency in connection with unresolved issues \r\nrelated to the Dayr al-Zour site and other locations. \r\nThere have been important developments \r\nconcerning the implementation of IAEA safeguards \r\nin the Islamic Republic of Iran. In July, Iran and the \r\nP5+1 countries agreed on a Joint Comprehensive Plan \r\nof Action. The Security Council asked the IAEA to \r\nundertake verification and monitoring of Iran’s nuclear-\r\nrelated commitments under the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action, and our Board of Governors authorized \r\nus to do so. Iran will implement the Additional Protocol \r\nto its Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA. That is \r\na powerful verification tool that will give the Agency \r\ngreater access to information and locations in Iran. \r\nIran also agreed to implement a number of additional \r\ntransparency measures that go beyond the scope of the \r\nAdditional Protocol and will help the Agency to better \r\nunderstand Iran’s nuclear activities. Also in July, I \r\nsigned a road map with Iran for the clarification of the \r\npossible military dimensions to the country’s nuclear \r\nprogramme by the end of this year. Activities set out \r\nin the road map were completed by the target date of \r\n15 October. We are now finalizing our analysis of all \r\nthe information at our disposal. I will present my final \r\nassessment on all past and present outstanding issues \r\nto the IAEA Board of Governors by 15 December. My \r\nreport will be factual, objective and impartial. Our \r\nmember States will determine the appropriate response. \r\nMuch work remains to be done, but I believe that \r\nthe significant progress made on the Iran nuclear issue \r\nrepresents a real success for diplomacy. It demonstrates \r\nthat even complex and challenging issues can be \r\ntackled effectively if all the parties are committed to \r\ndialogue — not dialogue for its own sake, but dialogue \r\naimed at achieving results. In the case of Iran, the \r\nsustained efforts of the IAEA, the P5+1 countries, the \r\nSecurity Council and, of course, Iran itself have got us \r\nto where we are today. The IAEA was able to make a \r\nvital contribution by sticking to its technical mandate \r\nand not straying into politics. The agreements reached \r\nin July represent a clear net gain for the IAEA from the \r\nverification point of view. The Agency will continue \r\nto implement safeguards in Iran with a view to being \r\nable in due course to draw what we call the broader \r\nconclusion, that all nuclear material continues to be \r\nintended for peaceful purposes.\r\nMany of our 166 countries face financial difficulties \r\nthat are likely to continue in the coming years. This \r\nmeans that our budget will remain under pressure. \r\n4/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nThe Agency will seek to maintain a balance between \r\nbudgetary constraints and the increasing demand for \r\nour services from our growing membership. We will \r\ncontinue to prioritize and seek efficiencies, while \r\nbeing careful not to undermine the high quality of our \r\nservices to member States.\r\nWe have intensified our efforts to increase the \r\nnumber of staff recruited from developing countries \r\nor from member States that are underrepresented or \r\nnot represented at all, especially at senior levels. Good \r\nprogress has been made in improving the representation \r\nof women in the IAEA secretariat, but more needs \r\nto be done. I remain committed to expanding the \r\nopportunities available to women, who make an \r\nenormous contribution to the work of the Agency, and \r\nI encourage member States to actively help us achieve \r\nour ultimate goal of equal gender representation.\r\nDespite our limited resources, the IAEA remains \r\nan organization that delivers concrete results. We will \r\ncontinue to fulfil our broad mandate in a balanced \r\nmanner, working to improve the well-being and security \r\nof the people of the world through the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear science and technology.\r\nThe President: I thank the Director General for his \r\nintroduction of the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Brazil \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/70/L.8.\r\nMr. De Aguiar Patriota (Brazil): Let me offer \r\nthe condolences of the Brazilian Government to the \r\npeople and the Governments of the countries affected \r\nby the recent terrorist attacks. We fully subscribe to \r\nyour statement at the start of our proceedings today, \r\nMr. President, which fully expresses the sentiments of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nI would like to thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, Director \r\nGeneral of the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA), for presenting the Agency’s 2014 report (see \r\nA/70/219) and for providing updates on its activities in \r\n2015.\r\nBrazil attaches great importance to the peaceful \r\napplications of nuclear energy, from human health, \r\nmedicine and the production of radioisotopes to \r\nthe nuclear fuel cycle, power generation, industry, \r\nagriculture and environmental protection. Nuclear \r\ntechnology can play an important role in the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1).\r\nWe fully support the IAEA’s implementation of \r\nsafeguards as well as efforts to achieve more efficiency \r\nin their application. In so doing, we must continue to \r\nensure that States’ obligations are met and that the \r\nAgency takes into account the various scopes and \r\ncorresponding safeguards measures derived from \r\nthe distinct categories of agreements entered into by \r\nmember States. The synergy between General Assembly \r\nresolutions, the three interrelated pillars of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \r\nIAEA’s statutory functions, including that of acting \r\n“in conformity with policies of the United Nations \r\nfurthering the establishment of safeguarded worldwide \r\ndisarmament”, is becoming increasingly apparent. The \r\nIAEA has conducted essential verification activities \r\nin the past, either in country-specific situations or \r\npursuant to requests from interested States parties to \r\ndisarmament agreements. That role, which has been \r\nhighlighted in successive IAEA General Conference \r\nresolutions, must be supported, and the IAEA secretariat \r\nshould stand ready to perform such tasks in the future.\r\nBrazil acknowledges the central role of the IAEA \r\nin strengthening the nuclear-security framework \r\nglobally, in an inclusive, transparent and multilateral \r\nmanner. We look forward to next year’s IAEA nuclear-\r\nsecurity conference, which will represent a significant \r\nopportunity for high-level consideration of the issue. It \r\nis our firm conviction that nuclear security activities \r\nmust be carried out in tandem with the international \r\ncommunity’s broader efforts to promote nuclear \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and the peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear energy.\r\nBrazil is honoured to chair the IAEA Board \r\nof Governors, in the person of our Permanent \r\nRepresentative to the Agency, Ambassador Laércio \r\nVinhas. It is therefore my pleasure to introduce, \r\nunder agenda item 87, the draft resolution entitled \r\n“Report of the International Atomic Energy Agency”, \r\ncontained in document A/70/L.8. This draft resolution, \r\nconsidered annually by the General Assembly, derives \r\nfrom a requirement pursuant to the IAEA Statute and \r\nthe agreement governing the relationship between \r\nthe IAEA and the United Nations. It constitutes an \r\nopportunity for Member States to be apprised of the \r\nAgency’s activities and to express their support for its \r\nwork.\r\n15-37040 5/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nThe draft resolution before the General Assembly \r\nwas discussed in October and early November in \r\nVienna, and informal consultations were also held in \r\nNew York last week. The text is being introduced on \r\nthe basis of resolution 69/7, of November 2014, and \r\ncontains technical updates only. It takes note of the \r\nannual report of the IAEA and of resolutions adopted by \r\nthe General Conference at its fifty-ninth session, from \r\n14 to 18 September 2015. It reaffirms strong support for \r\nthe Agency’s role in the application of atomic energy \r\nfor peaceful purposes. It also calls on Member States to \r\ncontinue supporting IAEA activities. As was the case \r\nlast year, the adoption of today’s draft resolution will \r\nsend a strong political signal of support for the work of \r\nthe Agency in its various fields, such as cooperation, \r\nsafety, security and verification.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Russia has carefully studied the annual \r\nreport (see A/70/219) of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) for 2014, prepared by the \r\nDirector General of the Agency, and the additional \r\ninformation on it. We note that an annex to the \r\nreport contains the factually inaccurate assertion \r\nthat during the reporting period of 2014, Sevastopol \r\nwas allegedly part of Ukraine. That knowingly false \r\nstatement ignores the fact that in a referendum held \r\nafter the illegal coup in Kyiv of February 2014, the \r\npopulation of Crimea, including the city of Sevastopol, \r\nvoted to secede from Ukraine and for reunification \r\nwith the Russian Federation. The people’s will was \r\nimplemented. Afterwards, we officially informed \r\nthe IAEA secretariat that the relevant installations in \r\nCrimea were under Russian jurisdiction, and we asked \r\nthe Agency to apply safeguards to them in accordance \r\nwith our Safeguards Agreement.\r\nFor those reasons, the Russian Federation cannot \r\naccept, and fully rejects, any statements in the annual \r\nreport and its annexes, or any other Agency documents, \r\nthat contradict that objective reality. As far as we are \r\nconcerned, they are legally and politically null and void. \r\nWe note that in the notes to the annual report for 2014, and \r\nin regard to the data in the list of nuclear installations, \r\nreference is made to the Agency’s statement that it does \r\nnot express any opinion whatsoever concerning the legal \r\nstatus of any country or territory or of its authorities, \r\nor concerning the delimitation of its frontiers. While \r\nwe have taken that reference into consideration, it does \r\nnot relieve us of our duty to express the aforementioned \r\nreservation. The Russian delegation first stated it at \r\nthe June meeting of the IAEA Board of Governors \r\nin Vienna. At our request, the text of the reservation \r\nwas distributed by the IAEA secretariat as Agency \r\ndocument INFCIRC/876. The reservation was part of a \r\ncompromise on the approval of the report by the Board \r\nof Governors and the General Conference of the IAEA, \r\nwhich was a precondition for Russia’s consent.\r\nIn the process of working on the draft resolution \r\nentitled “Report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency” (A/70/L.8) in Vienna, our country showed \r\nmaximum flexibility in order to keep open the \r\npossibility that it could be adopted by consensus. It was \r\nmerely a question of having the draft resolution make \r\nreference to our reservation on the annual report of the \r\nIAEA in the text. Furthermore, we do not object to the \r\nexpression of alternative views.\r\nUnfortunately, a number of States and the IAEA \r\nsecretariat choose to ignore objective reality. Not only \r\ndo they deny the fact that Crimea is an integral part \r\nof Russia, but they also wish to overlook the fact that \r\nour country has expressed a reservation with respect \r\nto the IAEA annual report. It seems that they prefer to \r\nfind themselves in a world of pleasant illusions. In this \r\nsituation we cannot support the proposed draft resolution \r\nbefore the General Assembly. It is truly regrettable that, \r\nafter such a long time, the draft resolution, which has \r\nalways been adopted by consensus, will cease to be \r\nso adopted. But we cannot support illusions that run \r\ncounter to reality.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Vrailas (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\ncandidate countries Turkey, the former Yugoslav \r\nRepublic of Macedonia, Montenegro and Albania; the \r\nEuropean Free Trade Association country Liechtenstein, \r\na member of the European Economic Area; as well as \r\nUkraine, the Republic of Moldova and Georgia, align \r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nWe are pleased to support draft resolution A/70/L.8 \r\non the report (see A/70/219) of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), a report that again reaffirms \r\nthe indispensable role of the Agency with regard to the \r\nnon-proliferation of nuclear weapons and in assisting \r\nthe development and practical application of atomic \r\nenergy for peaceful uses, in technology transfer and in \r\nnuclear safety, verification and security.\r\n6/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nThe European Union is fully committed to promoting \r\nuniversal accession to nuclear non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament agreements. We consider the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) to be \r\nthe cornerstone of the global nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime, the essential foundation for the pursuit of \r\nnuclear disarmament, in accordance with article VI of \r\nthe NPT, and vital for further development of nuclear \r\nenergy applications for peaceful purposes.\r\nWe call upon States that have not yet done so to \r\njoin the Treaty as non-nuclear-weapon States. While \r\nthe EU regrets that consensus could not be reached on a \r\nfinal document at this year’s NPT Review Conference, \r\nit remains committed to the establishment of a Middle \r\nEast zone free of nuclear weapons and all other weapons \r\nof mass destruction in line with the 1995 resolution on \r\nthe Middle East. We also note with satisfaction the \r\namount of strong support that was expressed for the \r\nAgency’s work.\r\nThe 2010 NPT Review Conference reaffirmed the \r\nrole of the IAEA in verifying and assuring compliance \r\nby States with their safeguards obligations and stressed \r\nthe importance of resolving all cases of non-compliance \r\nand of States parties responding resolutely and \r\neffectively in such cases. The European Union is \r\ndeeply concerned about the protracted and serious \r\nchallenges to the non-proliferation regime posed by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and the Syrian \r\nArab Republic. \r\nThe European Union welcomes the historic \r\nagreement of 14 July between the E3/EU+3 and Iran \r\non a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, in full \r\nconformity with NPT principles and endorsed by \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2231 (2015). The full and \r\nsustained implementation of the Plan of Action requires \r\nthe application and subsequent ratification by Iran of the \r\nAdditional Protocol to its Safeguards Agreement. The \r\nAdditional Protocol is an essential prerequisite for the \r\nAgency to be able to provide credible assurance about \r\nthe absence of undeclared nuclear material and activities \r\nin Iran and provide the international community with \r\nthe necessary assurances on the exclusively peaceful \r\nnature of Iran’s nuclear programme. The provisional \r\napplication and subsequent early ratification by Iran \r\nof the Additional Protocol would demonstrate Iran’s \r\ncommitment to the normalization of the nuclear issue.\r\nThe European Union would like to stress again \r\nthat the Security Council, as the final arbiter of \r\ninternational peace and security, has a mandate to take \r\nappropriate action in the event of non-compliance with \r\nNPT obligations, including safeguards agreements. \r\nThe Agency’s system of safeguards is a fundamental \r\ncomponent of the nuclear non-proliferation regime and \r\nplays an indispensable role in the implementation of the \r\nNPT. The measures contained in the Model Additional \r\nProtocol form an integral part of the IAEA safeguards \r\nsystem and, in the EU’s view, comprehensive safeguards \r\nagreements together with additional protocols \r\nconstitute the current IAEA verification standard. We \r\ncall for their universalization without delay. \r\nThe EU has firmly supported the continued \r\nevolution of safeguards, with a view to achieving \r\nthe efficient and effective implementation of IAEA \r\nsafeguards worldwide. We are grateful for the wide \r\nsupport received from IAEA member States, at the \r\nrecent IAEA General Conference, for the EU-sponsored \r\nresolution on strengthening the effectiveness and \r\nimproving the efficiency of Agency safeguards.\r\nThe European Union attaches importance to the \r\nhighest standards of nuclear safety being implemented \r\nand continuously improved in the EU and promoted \r\ninternationally. Last year the Council of the European \r\nUnion adopted a renewed directive to strengthen \r\nthe safety framework for nuclear installations. This \r\ndirective sets the objective of preventing accidents \r\nand, should they occur, mitigating their consequences \r\nand avoiding early and large radioactive releases. The \r\nVienna Declaration on Nuclear Safety, adopted earlier \r\nthis year by the Contracting Parties to the Convention \r\non Nuclear Safety (CNS) sets forth similar principles, \r\nand we will give serious attention to the implementation \r\nof the decisions taken in the Vienna Declaration, among \r\nothers, in preparation for, and participation in, future \r\nreview meetings of the CNS.\r\nWithin the framework of its strategy against the \r\nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, the EU \r\nis actively supporting Security Council resolutions \r\n1540 (2004) and 1887 (2009) together with other \r\ninternational initiatives, such as the Global Initiative \r\nto Combat Nuclear Terrorism, the Global Partnership \r\nagainst the Spread of Weapons and Materials of Mass \r\nDestruction and the Nuclear Security Summit process, \r\nthat contribute to strengthening nuclear security. Out \r\nof €260 million dedicated to chemical, biological, \r\nradiological and nuclear (CBRN) risk mitigation \r\nworldwide, more than €100 million has been allocated \r\n15-37040 7/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nto the EU’s regional CBRN Centres of Excellence \r\nInitiative.\r\nThe European Union strongly supports IAEA \r\nactivities in the area of nuclear security and is, together \r\nwith its member States, among the main contributors to \r\nthe Nuclear Security Fund. Approximately €40 million \r\nfrom EU funds and another €45 million from EU \r\nmember States have been contributed to the Nuclear \r\nSecurity Fund to date, for the benefit of about 100 \r\ncountries. We intend to continue to support the IAEA’s \r\nwork. The EU looks forward to the next high-level \r\nIAEA International Conference on Nuclear Security, \r\nwhich will take place in December 2016, and calls on \r\nall IAEA member States to participate at a high level.\r\nEffective physical protection is of the utmost \r\nimportance to preventing nuclear material from falling \r\ninto the hands of terrorists and proliferators and to \r\nprotecting nuclear facilities against malicious acts. The \r\nEuropean Union urges all States that have not yet done \r\nso to become party to the Convention on the Physical \r\nProtection of Nuclear Material and to accede to its 2005 \r\nAmendment. All EU member States have now ratified \r\nthe 2005 amendment to the Convention. The European \r\nUnion furthermore calls on States that have not yet \r\ndone so to make a political commitment to using in an \r\neffective manner the recommendations set out in the \r\nIAEA Code of Conduct on the Safety and Security of \r\nRadioactive Sources and its supplementary guidance \r\non the import and export of such materials.\r\nFinally, the European Union attaches the utmost \r\nimportance to the Agency’s technical cooperation \r\nprogramme and the role of the Agency in the responsible \r\ndevelopment of the peaceful applications of nuclear \r\ntechnology in the areas of, among things, human health, \r\nfood and agriculture, water resources, environment, the \r\npreservation of cultural heritage, nuclear and radiation \r\nsafety and nuclear energy. \r\nThe IAEA’s nuclear sciences and applications \r\nlaboratories at Seibersdorf contribute essential work \r\nin this respect, and we welcome the Director General’s \r\ninitiative regarding the modernization of the laboratories. \r\nThe EU also recognizes the valuable contribution that \r\nnuclear technology can provide in the attainment of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. The EU supports both \r\nthe IAEA and IAEA member States in the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear technology, also through technical \r\nexpertise, with a total amount of some €150 million per \r\nyear. The EU has allocated €225 million over the period \r\n2014-2020 for the promotion of nuclear safety, radiation \r\nprotection and the application of efficient and effective \r\nsafeguards of nuclear material in third countries.\r\nMs. AlGharabally (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly is today considering an important \r\nitem on its agenda, given its close connection with \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nin particular in the framework of the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security and the prohibition of \r\nharmful non-peaceful nuclear materials.\r\nWe have read closely the report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) (see A/70/219) for \r\nthe calendar year 2014 and support it in letter and \r\nin spirit, in particular the activities carried out in \r\n2014-2015. We pay tribute to the Director General of \r\nthe Agency, Mr. Amano, as well as his Bureau and \r\nthe various departments of the Agency, for the great \r\nefforts they have made to enhance and promote the role \r\nof the Agency, efforts that have highlighted the work \r\ncarried out to achieve peace, health and prosperity by \r\nemploying nuclear energy throughout the world.\r\nIn that context, Kuwait congratulates Turkmenistan, \r\nBarbados, and Antigua and Barbuda, as well as the \r\nother countries that have joined the Agency, and wishes \r\nthem success and prosperity. Economic and social \r\ndevelopment needs throughout the world will require \r\nincreasing energy resources in future. Since nuclear \r\nenergy is complementary, not alternative, to other \r\nenergy sources, the choice to use it must be made by \r\na State’s political authorities. Kuwait fully supports \r\nand cooperates with the various departments of the \r\nAgency to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy \r\nfor building national and institutional capabilities.\r\nWe aim for greater consultation and cooperation \r\nbetween our national institutions and the Agency. \r\nThat is why my country has contributed $3 million to \r\nstrengthen the activities of the Agency — $500,000 to \r\nthe Monaco Laboratory, $1 million to the Seibersdorf \r\nlaboratories and $1.5 million to the Peaceful Uses \r\nInitiative.\r\nIn the framework of scientific initiatives and \r\nprogrammes aimed at assisting developing countries, \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber \r\nAl-Sabah, Crown Prince of Kuwait, announced an \r\nannual prize of $1 million for the best research projects \r\nand initiatives for the development of African countries \r\nin the area of health, food and education.\r\n8/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nThe Agency’s technical cooperation programme \r\nis key to national capacity-building in developing \r\ncountries. Kuwait has always supported cooperation \r\nactivities. We welcome the efforts undertaken by the \r\nAgency in the technical cooperation region of the Asia-\r\nPacific, which include regional seminars and training \r\ncourses, which have a great positive effect on the \r\npromotion of capacity-building in those countries. We \r\nhope to see additional close and effective cooperation \r\nefforts in that respect and thank the Agency for its \r\nefforts and its visits to Kuwait.\r\nWe believe that the accession of all Member \r\nStates that have nuclear facilities to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is vital. I should \r\nlike also to congratulate Iran and the P5+1 on the \r\nhistoric accord concluded in Vienna and for Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2231 (2015), which will ease tension \r\nand strengthen stability in the region, making use of the \r\nfull potential of the countries of the region to achieve \r\nprogress and prosperity in the region.\r\nWe are therefore following attentively the \r\nimplementation of the security agreement for nuclear \r\nfacilities by encouraging the use of nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes. We invite Iran to engage in greater \r\ncooperation with the Agency, in full transparency. We \r\nalso hope that the historic agreement between the P5+1 \r\nand Iran will be an incentive for Iran to accede to other \r\nnuclear treaties, so that it can make use of the Agency’s \r\nknowledge in promoting security at its nuclear facilities \r\nand in the region.\r\nKuwait attaches particular importance to expanding \r\nthe Agency’s safeguards system in the Middle East \r\nregion to cover all nuclear activities, given that the \r\nAgency is the specialized body that has the mandate to \r\nmonitor and carry out this work.\r\nNevertheless, in spite of the fact that most \r\ncountries in the region have concluded such safeguards \r\nagreements, we note with deep regret that Israel has \r\nstill not acceded to the Treaty or placed its nuclear \r\nfacilities under IAEA safeguards, thereby threatening \r\nthe security and stability of the region. This presents a \r\nmajor obstacle to the creation in the Middle East of a \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons, which is clearly a negative \r\nstance with respect to the stability of the region and the \r\nworld. We have all been witness to the continued efforts \r\nto block the holding of a conference on the creation of \r\nsuch a zone, striving to create a region free of nuclear \r\nweapons and other weapons of mass destruction in the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nFollowing a number of studies and technical \r\nconsulations over a period of 10 years, the Agency \r\ncreated the first bank of low-enriched uranium, signing \r\nan agreement with Kazakhstan under which the latter \r\nwill host this nuclear-fuel bank.\r\nWe commend Russia on its signing with the Agency \r\nof a transit agreement for the transport of low-enriched \r\nuranium, which will allow several countries to obtain \r\nnuclear fuel for their peaceful activities. This great \r\nachievement, which took place on 27 August, ref lects \r\nthe generous contributions of several donor countries \r\nin response to the appeal made by the former Director \r\nGeneral of the IAEA, Mr. ElBaradei, who played a key \r\nrole in achieving this goal.\r\nThe central objective of the bank is to enable States \r\nto have access to low-enriched uranium for their nuclear \r\nlaboratories and activities for peaceful purposes, with \r\nthe goal of creating a safer and more secure world. \r\nTo that end, Kuwait has contributed $10 million to \r\nstrengthen IAEA activities. \r\nIn conclusion, Kuwait is committed to continuing \r\nits support for the Agency’s leading efforts and effective \r\ncontributions to achieving sustainable development in a \r\nnumber of developing countries in order to overcome \r\nobstacles in the areas of the economy, finance, health \r\ncare, food and climate change. That will clearly add to \r\nthe safety, well-being, prosperity and happiness of all \r\ncountries in the world. \r\nMr. Luque Márquez (Ecuador) (spoke in French): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to express our condemnation \r\nof the terrorist attacks that took place last Friday in \r\nParis, our condolences and our solidarity with the \r\npeople and the Government of France. As the President \r\nof Ecuador, Rafael Correa, said, our hearts are with \r\nFrance and the families of those who were victims of \r\nthe terrorist brutality.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nWe would like to thank Mr. Yukiya Amano, \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), for presenting the Agency’s annual \r\nreport (see A/70/219).\r\nFor Ecuador, the peaceful applications of nuclear \r\nenergy are of special importance because of their \r\ncontribution to development in some particularly \r\n15-37040 9/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nimportant areas, such as health care, agriculture and \r\nindustry. On that account, we would like the IAEA \r\nto further enhance its activities relating to science, \r\ntechnology and nuclear applications and to strengthen \r\nits technical cooperation programme. Ecuador \r\nwishes to highlight the key role that that programme \r\nperforms in meeting one of the central objectives \r\nof the IAEA Statute, namely, the promotion of the \r\npeaceful application of nuclear energy. We therefore \r\nacknowledge the efforts carried out to provide a more \r\neffective programme, intended to meet the needs and \r\nmatch the priorities of the IAEA member States. \r\nAccordingly, we wish to stress that the technical \r\ncooperation programme in Latin American and \r\nCaribbean countries once again recorded the highest \r\nimplementation rate of all regions over the past year. \r\nThat shows the importance of those activities for our \r\nregion and the interest shown by Latin American and \r\nCaribbean countries in implementing joint activities \r\nwith the IAEA. It is in that same context that the \r\nRegional Cooperative Agreement for the Advancement \r\nof Nuclear Science and Technology in Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean has played a key role. We are therefore \r\nconvinced that implementation of the regional strategic \r\nprofile that defines and prioritizes areas of cooperation \r\nwith the IAEA for the period 2016-2017 will help to \r\nincrease the number of projects that have an important \r\nimpact on the lives of our citizens.\r\nEcuador has made progress in drafting a new \r\natomic energy bill that will harmonize our national \r\nlegislation with the main areas of work of the IAEA \r\nand with the new basic safety standards that have been \r\nadopted internationally. The bill will soon benefit from \r\nthe input of an IAEA mission before being submitted \r\nto our National Assembly, where it will be debated. In \r\nthe near future, we will also have in place a law on \r\nthe management and transport of nuclear and other \r\nradioactive materials and a national emergency response \r\nplan for radiological accidents. Additionally, the \r\nDepartment of Nuclear Applications and Management \r\nin our Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy is \r\ndeveloping a process for reviewing technical standards \r\nthat will include support services to the regulatory \r\nauthority. In that regard, Ecuador is giving priority to \r\nstrengthening the regulatory authority by encouraging \r\nthe construction of new laboratories for nuclear \r\napplications. That will be a significant step forward for \r\nmy country and, to that end, we are counting in advance \r\non the IAEA’s cooperation in terms of providing the \r\nappropriate training and technology.\r\nThe Constitution of Ecuador condemns the \r\ndevelopment and use of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nTrue to that principle, we proudly reiterate that we \r\nare part of the first nuclear-weapon-free zone in a \r\nhighly populated area, as established by the Treaty of \r\nTlatelolco, and of a zone of peace, as proclaimed by \r\nthe Heads of State at the second and third Summits \r\nof the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates (CELAC), held in Havana and Belén, Costa \r\nRica. Furthermore, we continue to firmly believe in \r\nthe full implementation, without discrimination or \r\ndouble standards, of the three pillars of the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). We \r\nreiterate our concern because, while the objectives of \r\nthe Treaty on Non-Proliferation and the exercise of the \r\ninalienable right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy \r\nhave been implemented, there has been no progress on \r\nnuclear disarmament. We regret in no uncertain terms \r\nthat because of the obstruction of three States, it was \r\nnot possible to adopt the final document of the 2015 \r\nNPT Review Conference. At the same time, I must also \r\nexpress our dissatisfaction with the weakness of the \r\ncontents of the chapter on nuclear disarmament in the \r\ndraft final document of that Conference. I repeat that the \r\nnuclear-disarmament provisions of that draft document, \r\ncirculated in the last hours of the Conference, cannot, \r\nas far as my country is concerned, serve as a precedent \r\nor a basis for progress towards nuclear disarmament. \r\nEcuador, along with the other CELAC member \r\nStates, has repeatedly expressed its profound concern \r\nabout the enormous humanitarian consequences and \r\nglobal impact of any accidental or intentional nuclear \r\ndetonation. Accordingly, we believe that that issue must \r\nbe raised every time the nuclear question is discussed. \r\nIn that regard, we actively participated in conferences \r\nconvened in Oslo, Nayarit and Vienna, and we again urge \r\nthat States begin a diplomatic process for the adoption \r\nof a legally binding instrument for the prohibition and \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons. Ecuador encourages the \r\nIAEA to exercise its statutory function “in conformity \r\nwith policies of the United Nations [of] furthering the \r\nestablishment of safeguarded worldwide disarmament”, \r\nall the while preserving the highly technical nature of \r\nthe Agency and avoiding politicization.\r\nAs a staunch defender of the right to the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy, Ecuador has always recognized \r\nthat any State that so wishes should be able to develop \r\n10/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nsuch peaceful uses within the framework of the NPT. \r\nEcuador was therefore very pleased with the news of \r\nthe conclusion of an agreement between the P5+1 and \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the establishment of \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action regarding the \r\nIranian nuclear programme. The agreement is a historic \r\nmilestone not only because a long-term dispute has \r\nbeen resolved through negotiations, but also and mainly \r\nbecause dialogue prevailed over unilateralism, which \r\nhas caused such harm in contemporary international \r\nrelations. It was a reaffirmation of the efficiency of \r\ndiplomacy in the quest for lasting peace.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reaffirm Ecuador’s \r\ncommitment to the IAEA’s aim of ensuring that \r\nnuclear energy becomes safer, more efficient and more \r\nbeneficial for all of humankind.\r\nMr. Hashmi (Pakistan): We thank Director General \r\nAmano for presenting the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency’s annual report for 2014 (see A/70/219). We \r\ncommend him for his leadership and contribution.\r\nFor more than five decades, the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has worked successfully \r\nas a catalyst for enhancing the contribution of atomic \r\nenergy to peace, health and prosperity throughout the \r\nworld. The Agency has helped member States advance \r\ntheir development priorities while ensuring that nuclear \r\nscience and technology are used in a safe, secure and \r\nsustainable manner. For that, the Agency deserves the \r\ndeep appreciation of us all.\r\nWe note with interest the Agency’s projections \r\nfor 2030, which continue to indicate an increase in \r\nglobal nuclear power capacity. We share the Agency’s \r\nassessment that nuclear energy will continue to be \r\na preferable source of viable, safe and sustainable \r\nalternative in future, particularly in countries with \r\nfast-growing energy needs. That appraisal has been \r\nreiterated in the Agency’s publication Climate Change \r\nand Nuclear Power 2014, which states that, apart from \r\nhydropower and wind power, nuclear power emits the \r\nsmallest amount of greenhouse gases per kilowatt-hour \r\nof electricity produced. The publication also notes the \r\nimportance of nuclear power in providing energy-supply \r\nsecurity and other environmental and macroeconomic \r\nbenefits.\r\nPakistan is a strong advocate of utilizing nuclear \r\ntechnology for peace, progress and prosperity for all. \r\nAs the sixth most populous nation in the world, we are \r\nof the firm belief that socioeconomic development is a \r\nmajor priority for our country. For more than 55 years, \r\nwe have sought to harness the application of nuclear \r\ntechnology for economic and social development. \r\nThe Agency has been a valuable partner in those \r\nefforts, including through its Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme.\r\nPakistan’s economy is on an upward trajectory. \r\nIndustrial, agricultural and consumer demand for \r\nelectricity has been growing. With a population of more \r\nthan 180 million people and faced with a severe energy \r\ndeficit, we are tapping into all sources — hydropower, \r\nsolar and wind power and nuclear energy. Pakistan has \r\nfive operational nuclear facilities, which include three \r\nnuclear power plants and two research reactors. The \r\noldest of them was commissioned in 1972. Besides those \r\nplants, two more, producing 340 megawatts each, are \r\nexpected to be commissioned next year. Work has also \r\nbegun on two larger, third-generation nuclear-power \r\nplants of 1,100 megawatts each. With the completion \r\nof those two units, nuclear power will begin to make \r\na sizeable contribution to electricity generation in the \r\ncountry. Pakistan envisages a nuclear-power-generation \r\ncapacity of 40,000 megawatts under its Nuclear Energy \r\nVision 2050.\r\nAlthough we have more than four decades of \r\nexperience of safely operating nuclear power plants, we \r\nremain mindful of and attach the highest importance to \r\nthe safety and security of our current and future nuclear \r\npower plants. All nuclear power plants in Pakistan are \r\nunder IAEA safeguards.\r\nPakistan values the leading role that the Agency \r\nhas played in the wake of the Fukushima accident \r\nin harmonizing and coordinating global efforts to \r\nimprove nuclear safety of nuclear power plants. Under \r\nour Fukushima Response Action Plan, immediate \r\nand mid-term actions have already been taken and \r\nimplemented. Pakistan also interacts with the IAEA, \r\nthe World Association of Nuclear Operators (WANO) \r\nand others to enhance the safety of our nuclear-power \r\nplants. WANO expert missions regularly visit Pakistan \r\nto assess and suggest various safety measures for our \r\npower plants.\r\nOur Centre of Excellence for Nuclear Security \r\nconducts specialized training courses, including \r\nat the regional level, in the physical protection of \r\nnuclear materials and facilities, material control and \r\naccounting, personnel reliability, transport security \r\nand other security-related areas. The Pakistan Institute \r\n15-37040 11/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nof Engineering and Applied Sciences offers special \r\ncourses on nuclear security and physical protection \r\nas part of the curriculum in the nuclear engineering \r\nprogramme. The Institute is also poised to be a regional \r\nand international hub for training.\r\nOver the past decade, Pakistan’s nuclear regulatory \r\nmechanism has grown into an effective system \r\nunderpinned by a robust infrastructure. The Pakistan \r\nNuclear Regulatory Authority has based its regulations \r\non the IAEA safety standards. The Authority also offers \r\nitself for independent peer reviews. The Authority has \r\nvery close links with the IAEA, both as a recipient and \r\nas a contributor. It has established a National Institute \r\nof Safety and Security for facilitating national and \r\nregional training courses on nuclear security. It is \r\nequipped with state-of-the-art laboratories for training \r\nin nuclear radiation safety, nuclear security and physical \r\nprotection.\r\nBesides nuclear power, Pakistan has harnessed \r\nnuclear technology for socioeconomic development. \r\nIn the health sector, the Pakistan Atomic Energy \r\nCommission provides diagnostics and treatment \r\nthrough its 18 oncology medical hospitals, where about \r\n80 per cent of the cancer patients in the country are \r\ntreated each year. More such hospitals are planned.\r\nFor a country of more than 180 million people, \r\nfood security is of critical importance. Over the past 50 \r\nyears, four agriculture centres have been engaged in a \r\nvariety of research and development activities leading \r\nto higher use and better-quality agriculture products \r\nand livestock. The research and development work in \r\nthe physical sciences and engineering has also led us to \r\nmake important gains in water-resource management \r\nand the production of most of the radioisotopes required \r\nby the nuclear medical centres and the private sector.\r\nWith a sizeable civilian nuclear programme and \r\ndecades of experience in nuclear operations in the areas \r\nof power generation, health, medicine, agriculture, \r\nbiotechnology and industrial applications, Pakistan is \r\nuniquely placed to offer cooperation in the peaceful uses \r\nof nuclear energy to developing countries under IAEA \r\nsafeguards. We look forward to further strengthening \r\nour participation in IAEA promotional activities.\r\nPakistan has been an active and constructive \r\nparticipant in the Nuclear Security Summit process. \r\nWe have attended all Summit meetings at the highest \r\nlevel, so as to demonstrate the importance that we \r\nattach to nuclear security. The IAEA plays a central \r\nand leading role in the international nuclear-security \r\narchitecture as well as in the successor arrangements to \r\nthe Summit meetings for the post-2016 period. Through \r\nthe years, Pakistan has worked closely with the IAEA \r\nto strengthen nuclear security. We are implementing \r\na nuclear-security action plan in cooperation with the \r\nAgency.\r\nPakistan recognizes the important role played by \r\nthe IAEA verification regime. We share the view that \r\nall States should fully comply with their respective \r\nsafeguards obligations. We have fully complied with our \r\nown obligations, pursuant to our safeguards agreements \r\nwith the Agency. Implementation of the regulatory \r\naspects of the Agency represents an important area, \r\nin which safeguards play a key role. At the same time, \r\npromotional activities of the Agency are of the highest \r\npriority for developing counties. Equitable allocation \r\nof extra-budgetary resources is needed for both the \r\nsafeguards and the Technical Cooperation Programmes.\r\nPakistan is a State with advanced nuclear \r\ncapabilities. We have the experience, trained \r\nmanpower and facilities to become both a provider \r\nand a recipient of nuclear technology for peaceful \r\npurposes. Pakistan has played and will continue to play \r\nits constructive role in advancing non-proliferation \r\nobjectives, nuclear safety and security, as well as the \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear technology. Pakistan views \r\nits membership in export-control regimes, particularly \r\nthe Nuclear Suppliers Group, as a mutually beneficial \r\nproposition. We reiterate our call for an equitable, \r\nnon-discriminatory and criteria-based approach to \r\npromote civil nuclear cooperation and membership in \r\nexport-controls regimes.\r\nMr. Khoshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): At the \r\noutset, I would like to express my deepest condolences \r\nto the people and the Governments of France, Iraq and \r\nLebanon for the tragic loss of life of a number of their \r\ncitizens as a result of the recent heinous terrorist acts. \r\nI would also like to thank the Director General of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for his \r\npresentation of the Agency’s annual report for 2014 (see \r\nA/70/219).\r\nNuclear energy is bound to play a significant role \r\nin the development of developing countries as a result \r\nof their growing energy demands, in particular the \r\ndemand for electricity. To meet that demand without \r\ncontributing to climate change, more clean energy must \r\nbe produced.\r\n12/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nThe peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology \r\nare of great importance to the scientific, technological \r\nand socioeconomic development of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran. Iran has made a considerable investment in \r\nestablishing the necessary nuclear infrastructure \r\nand has achieved significant progress in the civil \r\napplications of nuclear science and technology in the \r\nmedical, agricultural and industrial fields.\r\nWe emphasize the importance of nuclear \r\nknowledge-sharing and the transfer of nuclear \r\ntechnology to interested developing countries, \r\nconsistent with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT), in order to enhance their \r\nscientific and technological capabilities and contribute \r\nto their sustainable socioeconomic development. In \r\nthat regard, the activities of the IAEA in the field of \r\ntechnical cooperation should play an important role. In \r\naccordance with its Statute, the primary responsibility \r\nof the IAEA is to assist member States in research \r\non and the development and practical application of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful uses. We stress the need \r\nto enhance the IAEA’s activities and contributions in \r\nthat area in order to meet the expectations of interested \r\ndeveloping nations, including Iran.\r\nOther mandates of the IAEA, in particular \r\nsafeguards-related verification activities, should be \r\ncarried out in support of its primary responsibility \r\nto promote the application of nuclear science and \r\ntechnology throughout the world. In that context, we \r\nemphasize that the design and implementation of the \r\nrequired safeguards must comply with the inalienable \r\nrights of NPT States parties and avoid hampering their \r\neconomic or technological development. Any efforts \r\nto enhance safeguards implementation, such as those \r\nthat are currently under consideration by the Agency, \r\nneed to ensure respect for the inalienable rights and \r\nthe national sovereignty of NPT States parties. We \r\nunderline that concerns related to nuclear proliferation \r\nshould not, in any way, restrict the inalienable rights of \r\nany NPT State party to develop all aspects of nuclear \r\nscience and technology for peaceful purposes, without \r\ndiscrimination, as stipulated in article IV of the Treaty.\r\nThe inalienable right of NPT States parties to \r\ndevelop research in and the production and use of \r\nnuclear energy, including national nuclear fuel cycles, \r\nfor peaceful purposes must be respected by all. The right \r\nof the NPT States parties to develop the use of nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes and their commitment \r\nto promote and facilitate the exercise of that right are \r\namong the main pillars of the core provisions of the \r\nTreaty. However, one can only express dismay over \r\nthe systematic attempts, applied under the pretext of \r\nnon-proliferation concerns and contrary to the letter \r\nand spirit of the Treaty, to restrict the application of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, on the basis of firm \r\nideological, strategic and international principles, has \r\ncategorically and consistently rejected weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, in particular nuclear weapons, as obsolete \r\nand inhuman and detrimental to international peace \r\nand security.\r\nThe conclusion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan \r\nof Action on 14 July signifies a crucial step by Iran \r\nand the E3+3, through negotiations and based on \r\nmutual respect, to resolve an unnecessary crisis that \r\nhad been manufactured by baseless allegations about \r\nthe peaceful Iranian nuclear programme, followed by \r\nunjustified politically motivated measures against \r\nthe people of Iran. The main foundation of the Plan \r\nof Action is provided by the reciprocal undertakings \r\nby the E3+3 and Iran, recognizing Iran’s peaceful \r\nnuclear programme and its enrichment activities and \r\nsimultaneously the termination of all of the provisions \r\nof previous Security Council resolutions, as well as the \r\ncomprehensive lifting of Security Council sanctions \r\nand all unilateral and multilateral nuclear-related \r\nsanctions. That signifies a fundamental shift in the \r\nSecurity Council’s approach. The same fundamental \r\nshift should be pursued by the IAEA, including by \r\nthe Board of Governors. All previous resolutions of \r\nthe Board, which are, in Iran’s view, unjustified and \r\npolitically motivated measures, should be terminated. \r\nWhile the Plan of Action, endorsed by Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2231 (2015), provides for nuclear \r\ncooperation with Iran and the continuation of its \r\nenrichment programme, the provisions of previous \r\nresolutions of the Board calling for suspension of the \r\nenrichment programme are no longer valid. The Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran is committed to fully implementing its \r\nvoluntary undertakings in good faith, contingent on the \r\nsame good-faith implementation of all undertakings by \r\nthe other parties, including those involving the removal \r\nof sanctions and restrictive measures under the Plan of \r\nAction.\r\nOn the other hand, in continuing their cooperation \r\nunder the Framework for Cooperation to accelerate \r\nand strengthen their cooperation and dialogue aimed \r\nat resolving, by the end of 2015, all past and present \r\n15-37040 13/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\noutstanding issues that have not already been resolved by \r\nthe IAEA and Iran, a road map was concluded between \r\nthe Agency and Iran. Iran faithfully implemented its \r\nvoluntary undertakings under the road map that was \r\nagreed on recently. We therefore expect that after the \r\nfinal assessment by the Director General is submitted, \r\nall past and present issues will be resolved once and \r\nfor all in the upcoming Board of Governors meeting on \r\n15 December.\r\nCooperation with the IAEA has a central place \r\nin Iran’s nuclear policy. In that regard, the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran firmly believes that the role of the \r\nAgency, in accordance with its Statute, is vital for \r\nthe peaceful uses of nuclear energy through technical \r\ncooperation with member States. In the light of the \r\nimminent implementation of the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action, all restrictions and limitations imposed \r\non the technical cooperation between Iran and the \r\nAgency should be removed in the 2016-2017 cycle.\r\nMr. Okamura (Japan) (spoke in French): It is with \r\ngreat feeling and profound sympathy that I address the \r\nGeneral Assembly with regard to the series of terrorist \r\nattacks that recently occurred in Paris, Beirut and \r\nBaghdad. Our hearts are with the families and friends of \r\nthe victims of those abominable attacks, as well as with \r\nthe Governments and the peoples concerned. Japan will \r\nalways maintain its solidarity with the international \r\ncommunity in condemning and combating terrorism, \r\nwhich is also an attack against our common values. \r\nJapan will remain resolute in its active contribution to \r\npeace, to stability and, above all, to the fight against \r\nterrorism, in collaboration with the entire international \r\ncommunity.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI would like to thank Director General Yukiya \r\nAmano for presenting the annual report (see A/70/219) \r\nof the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). \r\nSince last year, the international community has \r\nwitnessed some significant developments in such \r\nfields as nuclear safety, the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\ntechnology and non-proliferation. Japan would also like \r\nto warmly welcome Antigua and Barbuda, Djibouti, \r\nGuyana and Vanuatu as new members of the IAEA.\r\nJapan continues to fully support the IAEA so \r\nthat the Agency can fulfil its important role under the \r\nleadership of Director General Amano. Japan welcomes \r\nthe important advances in the implementation of the \r\nIAEA Action Plan on Nuclear Safety. Notable examples \r\ninclude the adoption of the Vienna Declaration on \r\nNuclear Safety in February, as well as the entry into force \r\nof the Convention on Supplementary Compensation for \r\nNuclear Damage in April, which resulted from Japan’s \r\naccession to the Convention. In August, the IAEA’s \r\nFukushima report was published. We appreciate the \r\ntireless efforts of all persons involved. Taking that report \r\nto heart, Japan is determined to devote its sincerest \r\nefforts to further enhancing nuclear safety. Moreover, \r\nI have the pleasure to report to the General Assembly \r\nthat at the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, \r\nwe are making solid progress in decommissioning \r\nthe plant and in managing contaminated water. The \r\noperation of the sub-drain system started in September. \r\nThe closing of the impermeable seaside wall was \r\ncompleted in October. Those two operations are \r\nexpected to considerably reduce the accumulation of \r\ncontaminated water. On behalf of the Government and \r\nthe people of Japan, let me express our renewed and \r\nsincere gratitude for the invaluable support from the \r\ninternational community, including the IAEA.\r\nDirector General Amano is promoting the concept \r\nof atoms for peace and development. The IAEA is \r\nconducting various activities under that concept to \r\nmeet the socioeconomic needs of developing countries \r\nby utilizing nuclear science and technology in such \r\nareas as food security, human health and water \r\nmanagement. With a view to achieving the recently \r\nadopted Sustainable Development Goals (see resolution \r\n70/1), the atoms for peace and development initiative is \r\nvery timely and important.\r\nAs part of our support for such timely IAEA efforts \r\nunder the leadership of Director General Amano, \r\nJapanese Foreign Minister Fumio Kishida announced \r\na contribution earlier this year of $25 million to the \r\nIAEA’s Peaceful Uses Initiative to be disbursed over \r\nthe next five years. More recently, Japan disbursed \r\nabout $1.2 million from its Peaceful Uses Initiative \r\ncontributions to support IAEA regional technical \r\ncooperation projects in the regions of Africa and \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean and in the Asia-\r\nPacific region. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto encourage the international community to provide \r\nfurther support for the IAEA’s activities in the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear science and technology.\r\nThe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action on the \r\nIranian nuclear issue is an important step for the \r\nenhancement of the international non-proliferation \r\nregime and for the stabilization of the Middle East. \r\n14/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nJapan welcomes the advent of adoption day for the Plan \r\nof Action on 18 October and hopes that implementation \r\nday will come at the earliest possible date. In close \r\ncoordination with the international community, Japan \r\nwill support the implementation process of the Plan of \r\nAction. Meanwhile, all past and present outstanding \r\nissues regarding Iran’s nuclear programme should \r\nbe clarified as early as possible, so as to dispel any \r\nconcerns of the international community and based on \r\nthe road map agreed between Iran and the IAEA.\r\nIn North-East Asia, North Korea’s continued \r\ndevelopment of nuclear and missile programmes poses a \r\nserious threat to the peace and security of the region and \r\nthe entire international community. Japan urges North \r\nKorea to refrain from any further provocative action and \r\nto take concrete steps towards complete, verifiable and \r\nirreversible denuclearization, and immediately cease all \r\nrelated activities. Japan also urges North Korea to fully \r\ncomply with the relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nand the 2005 Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, \r\nand to return to compliance with the safeguards of the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand the IAEA. In that regard, Japan fully supports the \r\nIAEA’s continued involvement in that issue.\r\nJapan wishes to play a more proactive role in \r\nmaintaining peace, prosperity and stability in the world \r\nunder the banner of “Proactive Contribution to Peace”, \r\nbased on the principle of international cooperation.\r\nNext year will mark the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the IAEA Statute. As a responsible member \r\nof the international community, Japan expresses its \r\nfirm determination to contribute further to ensuring \r\nand promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nMs. Del Sol Dominguez (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba supports the important work of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA). We welcome all the \r\nnew members of the Agency.\r\nTechnical cooperation is one of the main pillars of \r\nthe IAEA and deserves priority attention. In our country, \r\nwe look positively on the use of nuclear technology \r\nin such vital areas as human health, agriculture, \r\nfood supply, hydrology and the preservation of the \r\nenvironment. Such activities should be carried out in \r\nstrict compliance with safety regulations. In that regard, \r\nwe stress the essential role of international cooperation. \r\nWe accord special priority to the IAEA Programme of \r\nAction for Cancer Therapy, which should receive the \r\nnecessary financial resources to broaden its reach and \r\nresults.\r\nCuba continues to face obstacles and delays that \r\nhinder its cooperation with the Agency by virtue of \r\nthe sanctions policy that our people still face, which \r\nimposes severe restrictions on our programme with the \r\nIAEA. The restoration of diplomatic relations between \r\nCuba and the United States is the first step in a long, \r\ncomplex process towards the normalization of bilateral \r\nrelations and the definitive end of the blockade. We \r\nare grateful for the support that we receive each year \r\nfrom the IAEA and the international community in that \r\nregard.\r\nThe effective management of nuclear security does \r\nnot admit of exclusions or selectivities. International \r\nrules governing nuclear safety should be adopted \r\nin the framework of the IAEA through multilateral, \r\ntransparent and inclusive negotiations, with the \r\nparticipation of all States. Cuba welcomes the holding \r\nof the forthcoming IAEA International Ministerial \r\nConference on Nuclear Security in December 2016. We \r\nwill continue to strengthen the excellent cooperation \r\nbetween our country and the IAEA in implementing \r\nprojects aimed at improving physical nuclear security \r\nso as to be able to better control our borders and our \r\nfacilities that have Category 1 and 2 radioactive sources. \r\nIn the context of IAEA safeguards, our country has \r\nobtained dual certification and satisfactory results in \r\nAgency inspections for eight consecutive years. We \r\nmust preserve the credibility of the IAEA’s activities in \r\nthe field of safeguards, ensuring fair and professional \r\naction in that area.\r\nCuba supports efforts to improve the efficiency \r\nof the safeguards, provided they do not affect the \r\nlegitimate rights of States or establish discriminatory \r\nand selective practices. We welcome the progress \r\nmade in the ongoing negotiations between the IAEA \r\nand the Islamic Republic of Iran. We encourage \r\nfurther progress in that process. We also reaffirm our \r\nsupport for the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone in the Middle East. We truly regret that the \r\nproposed modalities for holding the Conference on the \r\nestablishment of a zone free of nuclear weapons and \r\nother weapons of mass destruction in the Middle East \r\nserved as the argument used by the three countries that \r\nblocked the final document of the Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons (NPT) held this year. The \r\nestablishment of such a zone would be a key contribution \r\n15-37040 15/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nto peace and security for all peoples in the region. We \r\nbelieve that the continued failure to implement the 1995 \r\nNPT Review Conference resolution on the Middle East \r\nand the failure to hold the Conference to establish that \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zone endanger the very credibility \r\nof the NPT.\r\nGreater efficiency and effectiveness is needed \r\nin adopting IAEA decisions, which will require \r\nstrengthening the General Conference as the supreme \r\nlegislative body in which all member States participate. \r\nWe should also thoroughly consider the composition \r\nand functions of the Board of Governors.\r\nHumankind will remain in danger of being \r\nannihilated by the more than 16,000 existing nuclear \r\nweapons. That is why nuclear disarmament cannot \r\nremain an objective that is always postponed or subject \r\nto conditions. The only way to avoid the use or threat \r\nof use of nuclear weapons is their total prohibition and \r\nelimination, under strict international verification. The \r\nIAEA has an important role to play in that respect. \r\nCuba will stand firm in the battle to achieve a world \r\nfree of nuclear weapons. That is our commitment to \r\npresent and future generations.\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland is deeply shocked and saddened by the \r\nterrorist attacks perpetrated in Paris, Beirut, Baghdad \r\nand over the Sinai peninsula in the past few weeks. \r\nSwitzerland firmly condemns such hateful acts, \r\nwhich run counter to the fundamental values of all \r\nsocieties, and we assure the countries affected of our \r\nfull solidarity. Switzerland also extends its deepest \r\ncondolences to the families of the victims and to all of \r\nthe countries affected.\r\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) \r\nhas had to face a number of major challenges this year, \r\nand others are on the horizon. Of those challenges, \r\nSwitzerland would like to highlight the following four.\r\nFirst, Switzerland welcomes the agreement reached \r\non 14 July on the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \r\nbetween Iran and the ЕЗ/EU+3. My country hopes \r\nthat the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which \r\nwas the result of several years of intense and difficult \r\nnegotiations, will be implemented in a constructive \r\nmanner by all of the parties involved. The IAEA, which \r\ncontributed significantly to the July agreement, will \r\nhave a key role to play in verifying the implementation \r\nof the nuclear part of the agreement. Switzerland \r\nsupported the negotiation process that led to the \r\nadoption of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \r\nand has provided financial support for the work of the \r\nIAEA resulting from those negotiations.\r\nSecondly, Switzerland welcomed the holding of a \r\ndiplomatic conference in February 2015 to discuss an \r\namendment that it had introduced within the framework \r\nof the Convention on Nuclear Safety. The resulting \r\nVienna Declaration on Nuclear Safety was adopted \r\nunanimously, establishing the principle that state-of-\r\nthe-art technology should ensure safety at new nuclear \r\nfacilities and that existing facilities should be subject \r\nto regular checks and continuous safety improvements. \r\nSwitzerland is working to ensure that the objectives \r\nof the Declaration become the benchmark for nuclear \r\nsafety and are integrated into the wider framework of \r\nthe IAEA, which sets global standards for nuclear safety. \r\nEnhancing nuclear safety remains a vital, ongoing \r\neffort. The IAEA’s challenge will be to continue its \r\nefforts to develop its nuclear-safety strategy. The IAEA \r\ncan count on Switzerland’s support in the fulfilment of \r\nthat task.\r\nThirdly, at the IAEA General Conference this \r\nyear, the issue of nuclear security was discussed at \r\nlength, resulting in a resolution that, for the first time, \r\nestablished a clear link between disarmament and \r\nnuclear security. Switzerland welcomes that resolution, \r\nas we are convinced that in order to be all-encompassing \r\nand credible, the approach taken to nuclear security must \r\nbe more broadly based, taking on board the obvious \r\nlink between nuclear security and nuclear disarmament \r\nas well as the entire range of nuclear materials that \r\nexist, both civilian and military. In more than one \r\nrespect, 2016 will be the year of nuclear security, and \r\nSwitzerland welcomes the decision by the IAEA to hold \r\na ministerial conference on nuclear security next year. \r\nMy country is indeed convinced that, given its broad \r\nmembership and its capability to combine technical \r\nexpertise and political leadership, the IAEA is ideally \r\nplaced to play a steering role in international efforts in \r\nthe area of nuclear security.\r\nFourthly, Switzerland supports the IAEA report \r\nentitled The Conceptualization and Development of \r\nSafeguards Implementation at the State Level, and hence \r\nsupports the work of the Secretariat to implement such \r\na concept. Indeed, on the one hand, the IAEA is seeing \r\nan increase in its verification tasks and there is a desire \r\namong member States to see it become more active in \r\nother areas, including nuclear security and safety. On \r\nthe other hand, those developments are coming at a \r\n16/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\ntime of persistent reluctance to increase budgets. The \r\nState-level concept must therefore lead to a genuine \r\noptimization of the effectiveness of the safeguards \r\nsystem. That will most likely mean a complete review \r\nof current practice and a better targeting of priorities in \r\norder to make genuine improvements to management, \r\nin terms of effort and cost, that are both substantial \r\nand measurable for the IAEA and also for the States \r\nconcerned.\r\nThe assessment made thus far by the Secretariat on \r\nthe State-level concept has indicated that the potential \r\nfor efficiency gains is limited. Switzerland does not \r\nshare that view, and we are convinced that there is real \r\nroom for manoeuvre, but a culture change within the \r\nIAEA is necessary to achieve it. In fact, the thought \r\nprocess set in motion by the State-level concept cannot \r\nbe restricted to the mere quest for efficiency gains. \r\nWe will most likely need to extend our thinking more \r\nbroadly to the overall management of the IAEA, if we \r\nwant it to be able to meet all of the challenges that lie \r\nahead.\r\nMr. Phua (Singapore): On behalf of my delegation, \r\nallow me to begin by extending my deepest condolences \r\nand solidarity to the countries that recently suffered \r\nheinous terrorist attacks. Singapore supports all efforts \r\nto bring the perpetrators of such crimes to justice.\r\nI thank Director General Yukiya Amano for the \r\ncomprehensive annual report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (see A/70/219). Singapore has \r\nconsistently supported the work of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in promoting the \r\nsafe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear science \r\nand technologies. We are pleased to continue our \r\nco-sponsorship of the draft resolution on the report \r\nof the IAEA (A/70/L.8), and we regret that the draft \r\nresolution will not be adopted by consensus this year.\r\nSingapore has consistently taken the view that \r\nnuclear safety is an issue of concern to all States and \r\nnot merely to States with nuclear installations. That \r\nis because nuclear accidents may have catastrophic \r\nconsequences that transcend national borders.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation to \r\nthe IAEA and the Secretariat for their work on the \r\ncomprehensive report of the Director General entitled \r\nThe Fukushima Daiichi Accident. It is a sobering \r\nreminder of the dangers of complacency and of the \r\nfact that countries operating nuclear power plants bear \r\nresponsibility to their peoples and the international \r\ncommunity to ensure that their regulatory frameworks, \r\nplant design, operational safety procedures and culture, \r\nand emergency preparedness and response are robust at \r\nall times. The report provides a valuable repository of \r\nknowledge that can be drawn upon to ensure that such \r\naccidents do not happen again.\r\nThe Diplomatic Conference of the Convention on \r\nNuclear Safety, convened in February 2015, adopted the \r\nVienna Declaration on Nuclear Safety by consensus. \r\nWe urge all contracting parties to the Convention, \r\nespecially countries with nuclear installations and those \r\nplanning to embark on a civilian nuclear programme, \r\nto implement the safety objectives contained in the \r\nDeclaration expeditiously and in good faith. Singapore \r\nwill fulfil its responsibilities and cooperate with the \r\nIAEA and member States to contribute towards the \r\nstrengthening of international and regional standards \r\nof nuclear safety.\r\nThe IAEA plays a central role in promoting the \r\nsafe, secure and peaceful use of nuclear energy, which \r\nis critical to furthering the objectives of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). \r\nWhile Singapore has consistently expressed support \r\nfor the right of all sovereign States to use nuclear \r\nenergy for peaceful purposes, we also believe that the \r\nright must be exercised in strict accordance with the \r\nprovisions of the NPT. We urge States, particularly the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, to refrain from \r\nall provocative actions, to return to the NPT, to fully \r\ncomply with all relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nand to resume full cooperation with the IAEA.\r\nSingapore also welcomes the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action agreed between the P5+1 and Iran. The \r\nagreement is a significant step in the right direction, but \r\nthe implementation of the agreement will be critical. We \r\nurge all parties to fulfil their obligations expeditiously \r\nand in good faith. Singapore recognizes the essential \r\nrole of the IAEA in verifying and monitoring the \r\nnuclear-related measures set out in the agreement. We \r\nsupport the Agency’s implementation of the measures \r\ncontained in Security Council resolution 2231 (2015) \r\nand look forward to the Director General’s report on \r\nthe implementation of the road map for the clarification \r\nof past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran’s \r\nnuclear programme, signed on 14 July.\r\nSingapore welcomes the valuable work of the IAEA \r\nin mobilizing peaceful applications of nuclear science \r\nand technology to address critical global challenges \r\n15-37040 17/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nin myriad areas, such as food and agriculture, public \r\nhealth, water resources and the environment. Singapore \r\nhas collaborated with the IAEA since 2000 to jointly \r\nprovide technical assistance to other fellow developing \r\nIAEA member States. We are pleased to have renewed \r\nour commitment to work together when we welcomed \r\nDirector General Amano to Singapore in January this \r\nyear and committed to an updated memorandum of \r\nunderstanding on the Singapore-IAEA Third Country \r\nTraining Programme. Under the scope of that revised \r\nmemorandum, Singapore and the IAEA will provide \r\njoint technical assistance to other developing countries \r\nin a number of areas, including nuclear medicine and \r\nnuclear safety. We have begun with a joint training \r\nprogramme for participants from 11 countries on the \r\nstrategy for and evaluation of trials on suppression of \r\nthe Aedes genus of the mosquito population by using the \r\nsterile insect technique. We hope that it will be merely \r\nthe first programme within a fruitful cooperation.\r\nSingapore also supports the IAEA’s continued \r\ncooperation with regional organizations. We welcome \r\nthe progress made by the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations Network of Regulatory Bodies on Atomic \r\nEnergy (ASEANTOM) in strengthening cooperation \r\namong countries in Southeast Asia aimed at promoting \r\ngreater nuclear safety, security and safeguards within \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations community. \r\nASEANTOM has proposed an IAEA regional technical \r\ncooperation project to support the establishment of a \r\nregional environmental radioactivity database and an \r\nemergency preparedness and response framework, \r\nwhich will commence in 2016. We look forward to \r\nthe further strengthening of the collaboration between \r\nASEANTOM and the IAEA.\r\nIn conclusion, Singapore is a proud partner of the \r\nIAEA, which has done good work and made significant \r\ncontributions to the international community. We look \r\nforward to continuing our cooperation.\r\nMr. Alemu (Ethiopia): It gives me great pleasure to \r\nspeak on this important agenda item under consideration \r\ntoday. I would like to express appreciation and gratitude \r\nto the Director General of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA), Ambassador Amano, for his \r\ncomprehensive 2014 annual report on the work of the \r\nAgency (see A/70/219).\r\nEthiopia commends the IAEA for its continued \r\nefforts to discharge its responsibilities with regard to \r\nhelping member States use nuclear energy for peaceful \r\npurposes. We believe that the three pillars of the IAEA \r\nwill continue to play a key role in achieving the newly \r\nadopted 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) by promoting the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear technologies while addressing the risk of \r\nnuclear proliferation. From our perspective, the IAEA \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme, including the \r\nprovision of guidance to member States, is of critical \r\nimportance. In that regard, the development of nuclear-\r\npower projects and the promotion of the application \r\nof nuclear technology to human health, medical \r\nservice, food and agriculture, and the protection of the \r\nenvironment are of vital importance.\r\nIn Ethiopia, the Agency’s technical cooperation \r\ncontinues to be vital in supporting the Government’s \r\nefforts to develop capabilities in the areas of tsetse \r\nf ly control, cancer treatment, diagnostic nuclear \r\nmedicine services, isotope hydrological analysis and \r\nnon-destructive quality testing, and national nuclear \r\nscience and technology infrastructure. We have \r\nimproved our capacity through personnel training, \r\nequipment acquisition, expert missions and other forms \r\nof technical assistance from the IAEA.\r\nWith the view to supporting the Agency’s advocacy \r\nof the peaceful use of nuclear technology, Ethiopia is a \r\nsignatory to a number of IAEA treaties and conventions. \r\nWe also firmly believe that the provision of sufficient \r\nand predictable resources to the Agency’s programmes \r\nand, more importantly, the balanced distribution of \r\nresources to its safeguards, nuclear safety and technical \r\ncooperation activities need to be ensured. In fact, the \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme plays a crucial \r\nrole as a means of transferring nuclear technology to \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nOur biggest technical cooperation project with \r\nthe IAEA is aimed at eradicating the tsetse f ly from \r\nthe Southern Rift Valley region. That insect still \r\nposes a genuine threat to the lives and livelihoods \r\nof our communities and is a constraint on livestock \r\nproduction in Ethiopia. The Southern Rift Valley \r\nTsetse Eradication Project is currently under way and \r\nremarkable achievements have been made in connection \r\nwith the expansion of farmland and livestock farming.\r\nWith regard to the Programme of Action for Cancer \r\nTherapy, Ethiopia commends the IAEA for its role and \r\ncontinued support in consolidating the comprehensive \r\ncancer-control programmes at the Black Lion \r\nSpecialized Hospital in Addis Ababa, which serves as a \r\n18/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nreferral hospital. The Agency has also been extending \r\nits support to the expansion of nuclear medicine and \r\nradiotherapy centres in five more selected regional \r\nuniversity hospitals. It is in that light that Ethiopia \r\nreiterates its call for increased resources from the \r\nregular budget to cover the increasing burdens faced \r\nby the Technical Cooperation Fund in implementing \r\nthe Technical Cooperation Programme. We are also of \r\nthe view that both national measures and international \r\ncooperation are essential for nuclear and radiation \r\nsafety.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to emphasize that \r\nthe Agency has a key role to play in the promotion of \r\na global safety culture. The Agency’s safeguards are \r\namong the basic components of the non-proliferation \r\nregime and create an environment conducive to nuclear \r\ndisarmament and nuclear cooperation. Furthermore, \r\nin responding to the threats from non-State actors, \r\nparticularly terrorists, who seek to acquire weapons of \r\nmass destruction, the collaborative efforts of member \r\nStates, international organizations and civil society \r\nare critical. In that connection, the implementation \r\nof Security Council resolutions 1540 (2004) and 1887 \r\n(2009) is also essential for addressing nuclear-related \r\nthreats.\r\nThe safeguards and verification mandates of the \r\nAgency illustrate the importance of the Agency’s \r\ncontinued vigilance and contributions to international \r\npeace and security. In that regard, Ethiopia strongly \r\nsupports the right of all States to enjoy the full use \r\nof nuclear technology and its scientific application in \r\naccordance with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons.\r\nTo conclude, I wish to reiterate our profound \r\nthanks and appreciation to the IAEA, particularly its \r\ngoverning body and leadership, for their dedication to \r\nstrengthening essential technical cooperation between \r\nthe Agency and countries such as Ethiopia. Let me also \r\nreiterate our assurances that Ethiopia will continue to \r\ndo its level best to further enhance the positive spirit \r\nof cooperation with the Agency, as well as with all the \r\ndevelopment partners that have so far made generous \r\ncontributions to our development endeavours, including \r\nin that critical area.\r\nMr. Hahn Choonghee (Republic of Korea): \r\nLet me begin by thanking the Director General of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), \r\nMr. Yukiya Amano, for introducing the Agency’s \r\nannual report for 2014 (see A/70/219). We welcome \r\nthe report’s thematic overview of the IAEA’s activities \r\nand underline the importance that the Republic of \r\nKorea attaches to a balanced programme of work. \r\nWe believe that such a programme will contribute to \r\npromoting the peaceful applications of nuclear science \r\nand technology, enhancing nuclear safety and security, \r\nand strengthening global nuclear verification and \r\nnon-proliferation efforts.\r\nThe international community has just adopted \r\nthe ambitious new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) with its Goals aimed \r\nat promoting shared prosperity for the next 15 years. \r\nEnsuring that all Member States share the benefits \r\nof nuclear science and technology for their economic \r\nand social development will contribute to achieving \r\nthose common development goals. In that regard, we \r\nwelcome the IAEA secretariat’s efforts to fully align \r\nits Technical Cooperation Programme with the 2030 \r\nAgenda.\r\nAs we approach the twenty-first session of the \r\nConference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, the \r\nRepublic of Korea would also like to highlight the \r\ncontribution of nuclear power to energy-supply security, \r\nwith its environmental and macroeconomic benefits. \r\nWe will continue to work with the Agency and others \r\nto ensure that nuclear power remains a viable option for \r\nhelping to meet the climate and energy challenges of \r\nthe twenty-first century.\r\nThe 2011 accident at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear \r\npower station was a solemn reminder that nuclear safety \r\ncan never be taken for granted. As we move forward, \r\nsustaining the momentum that we have built up in the \r\nfield of nuclear safety is essential. We believe that the \r\nAgency’s report on the Fukushima Daiichi accident \r\nwill be an objective guide to and a strong reminder of \r\nthe importance of nuclear-safety preparedness. The \r\nreport’s findings are not the end but the beginning of \r\nour collective endeavour to understand and learn from \r\nthe accident and strengthen nuclear safety worldwide. \r\nBoth the General Assembly and IAEA member States \r\nhave recognized and reaffirmed the central role that the \r\nAgency has played in strengthening the global nuclear-\r\nsecurity architecture. As the host country of the 2012 \r\nSeoul Nuclear Security Summit, the Republic of Korea \r\nis a strong supporter of the Agency’s work in that field \r\nand would like to draw attention to the December 2016 \r\n15-37040 19/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nInternational Conference on Nuclear Security that \r\nKorea will chair at the ministerial level.\r\nGiven the vital contribution of the IAEA \r\nsafeguards to international peace and security, the \r\nRepublic of Korea is pleased to note that, in 2014, the \r\nAgency continued to improve the effectiveness and the \r\nefficiency of the safeguards. We are encouraged by the \r\ngrowing acceptance of the State-level concept and the \r\ncontinuing increase in the number of comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreements, additional protocols and \r\namended small-quantities protocols that are in force. \r\nIn that regard, as of October, Korea became one of \r\ntwo member States to apply the new version of the \r\nState-level approach.\r\nThe Republic of Korea is encouraged by the \r\nprogress made in resolving the past and present \r\noutstanding issues of Iran’s nuclear programme. We \r\ntake note of the Agency’s statement that the activities \r\nset out in the road map agreed between the Agency and \r\nIran were completed as planned by 15 October, and we \r\nhope that all parties concerned will continue in good \r\nfaith their efforts to ensure an exclusively peaceful \r\nIranian nuclear programme.\r\nDespite such positive developments, however, \r\nsignificant safeguards challenges remain. We continue \r\nto view with grave concern North Korea’s continued \r\nviolation of its international obligations to abandon \r\nall nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes \r\nand immediately cease all related activities, especially \r\nin the light of its ongoing provocations and public \r\nstatements vowing to pursue the further development \r\nof nuclear weapons. The Republic of Korea feels \r\ncompelled, therefore, to reiterate that North Korea \r\ncannot have the status of a nuclear-weapon State and \r\nthat it must fully comply with all its obligations under \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions and fulfil \r\nits commitments under the 19 September 2005 Joint \r\nStatement of the fourth round of the Six-Party Talks.\r\nAlong with the international community, we stand \r\nready to offer a brighter future to North Korea, if it \r\ndemonstrates a genuine willingness to completely \r\nabandon its nuclear-weapons programme and agrees to \r\nabide by its international obligations and commitments. \r\nHowever, its negative response to past diplomatic efforts \r\nunderlines the need for the international community to \r\nreiterate a strong and unified message that the path to \r\npeace, stability and prosperity hinges on North Korea’s \r\nwillingness to return to meaningful denuclearization \r\ntalks. In that regard, we appreciate the resolution on \r\nthe North Korean nuclear issue adopted by consensus \r\nat the fifty-ninth IAEA General Conference this past \r\nSeptember. While maintaining extra vigilance, the \r\nRepublic of Korea will continue its constructive efforts \r\nto achieve a peaceful resolution of the North Korean \r\nnuclear issue and looks forward to working with others \r\nto that end.\r\nThe Republic of Korea reiterates its full support for \r\nthe work of the IAEA in achieving our common goal of \r\nharnessing nuclear energy in the service of peace and \r\ndevelopment for humankind. We join others in support \r\nof this year’s draft resolution A/70/L.8 on the report of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nMr. Isnomo (Indonesia): Indonesia joins the \r\ninternational community in condemning the shameful \r\nand cowardly terrorist attacks that occurred in France \r\nand Lebanon and conveys its heartfelt condolences to \r\nthe Governments and the peoples of those two countries.\r\nMy delegation would like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation to the Director General of the IAEA \r\nfor preparing a comprehensive report on the work of \r\nthe Agency during 2014 (see A/70/219) and for his \r\nintroductory statement, which contains additional \r\ninformation on the activities of the Agency during 2015.\r\nIndonesia takes note of the developments and \r\nsignificant activities of the Agency during the reporting \r\nperiod, covering nuclear technology in power and \r\nnon-power applications, nuclear safety and security, \r\nnuclear verification and technical cooperation. In that \r\nregard, Indonesia welcomes the Agency’s continuous \r\nefforts to provide the necessary support to member \r\nStates in the aforementioned fields. We encourage the \r\nIAEA secretariat to continue to pursue and adapt its \r\nprogramme of work in a balanced manner to meet the \r\nchanging needs of member States and to ensure that \r\nsufficient resources are allocated in that respect so \r\nthat the benefits of nuclear science and technology are \r\nshared by all member States for their socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIndonesia believes that the Agency’s technical \r\ncooperation programme plays an indispensable role as \r\nthe main vehicle through which the Agency delivers \r\nits mandate of promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\ntechnology, especially in developing countries. Given \r\nthe key role played by the technical cooperation \r\nprogramme, Indonesia underlines the need to earmark \r\na significant portion of contributions for the Technical \r\n20/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nCooperation Fund to ensure that there are sufficient \r\nresources for the programme.\r\nSince 2012, Indonesia has been a contributor to the \r\nIAEA Peaceful Uses Initiative (PUI), which supports \r\nthe IAEA programme on technical cooperation among \r\ndeveloping countries. It is currently developing a \r\nregional capacity-building initiative for the Asia Pacific \r\nregion with the IAEA within the PUI framework. The \r\nInitiative envisages structural and sustainable technical \r\ncooperation and encourages the recipient, provider and \r\ndonor countries to sit down with the IAEA and plan \r\ntogether. In that context, Indonesia will continue its \r\nsupport for all PUI activities, particularly in the area of \r\nknowledge exchange in nuclear and nuclear-application \r\ntechnology in agriculture. It will also continue to assign \r\nits cost-free experts to support technical cooperation on \r\nnuclear security and nuclear application.\r\nIndonesia is pleased that Director General Yukiya \r\nAmano has put more emphasis on promoting the \r\napplication of nuclear science and technology for the \r\nbenefit of humankind in the areas of food and agriculture, \r\nhealth, industry and the environment. In that regard, \r\nIndonesia welcomes the Agency’s continuing efforts \r\nto strengthen its capacity and its services to member \r\nStates, including the initiative to renovate the nuclear \r\napplication laboratories in Seibersdorf.\r\nIndonesia wishes to reiterate the importance of the \r\nrole of the Agency in fostering international cooperation \r\nin the peaceful uses of nuclear energy and technology, \r\nnuclear safety and security. We fervently hope that the \r\ncooperation between Indonesia and the Agency can be \r\nfurther expanded and developed. We also would like \r\nthe Agency to step up collaboration and support for the \r\napplication of nuclear science and technology in the \r\nregion.\r\nSince becoming a member of the Agency in \r\n1957, Indonesia has been steadfast in its commitment \r\nto the IAEA’s Technical Cooperation Programme. \r\nIndonesia itself has benefited significantly from IAEA \r\ncooperation in the areas of food and agriculture, health, \r\nwater, and other peaceful uses of nuclear energy and is \r\nnow ready to work with the Agency to provide technical \r\ncooperation to other developing countries. An IAEA \r\ncollaborating centre was established in Jakarta in 2015 \r\nand is ready to be utilized for that purpose.\r\nWith regard to nuclear safety, Indonesia wishes to \r\ndraw attention to the IAEA site and external events \r\ndesign service and to the visit of the integrated regulatory \r\nreview service mission conducted in August 2015. \r\nWith the support provided by the Agency, Indonesia \r\nconducted a nuclear-energy system assessment using \r\nthe Agency’s International Project on Innovative \r\nNuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles methodology and \r\nsubmitted its first assessment report, which focuses on \r\na large power reactor that is part of its efforts to sustain \r\nnuclear energy development.\r\nIn the area of security, Indonesia ratified the \r\nInternational Convention for the Suppression of Acts \r\nof Nuclear Terrorism in 2014, the Convention on the \r\nPhysical Protection of Nuclear Material in 1986 and the \r\n2005 Amendment through a presidential decree in 2009. \r\nIndonesia has also officially inaugurated the Indonesia \r\nCentre as a centre of excellence in nuclear security and \r\nemergency preparedness at the national and regional \r\nlevels. Furthermore, the Indonesian National Nuclear \r\nEnergy Agency has launched a programme to construct \r\na small-scale, non-commercial, multipurpose power \r\nreactor to demonstrate electricity production in a safe \r\nmanner, enhance knowledge and competence with \r\nrespect to nuclear power and non-power technology \r\nand promote public acceptance of nuclear power. \r\nThat reactor is expected to be commissioned by 2020. \r\nIndonesia extends its appreciation to the IAEA for its \r\nsupport of this programme.\r\nIn relation to safeguards, Indonesia welcomes \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action between Iran \r\nand the P5+1 on 14 July in Vienna, and the adoption \r\nof Security Council resolution 2231 (2015). Indonesia \r\nbelieves that those successful negotiations represent a \r\ndecisive step by both sides towards a final resolution \r\nof the Iranian nuclear issue. Indonesia calls on all \r\nthe parties, including the P5, to adhere to the agreed \r\ncommitments in the Plan, with a view to reaching a \r\ndurable and peaceful solution. Indonesia also reaffirms \r\nits support to the Agency in implementing the \r\nverification and monitoring of the Plan.\r\nIndonesia will continue to support the IAEA in \r\nfulfilling its mandate as enshrined in its statute. In \r\nthe light of the numerous developments affecting \r\nthe global architecture, my delegation believes that \r\nthe Agency needs to revisit its current practices \r\nunder the statute, to improve its work and make it \r\nmore efficient, representative and transparent. As a \r\ncommitted member of the IAEA, Indonesia continues \r\nto contribute its resources in many ways to support the \r\nAgency, including by becoming the external auditor of \r\nthe IAEA for the period 2016-2017. With a wide range \r\n15-37040 21/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nof auditing experience, the Indonesian Audit Board \r\nintends to utilize that opportunity to further contribute \r\nto the work of the Agency by providing a high-quality \r\naudit service in order to promote accountability and \r\ntransparency in the role of the Agency, which is to \r\nensure the safe, secure, and peaceful uses of nuclear \r\nenergy.\r\nAs a reflection of Indonesia’s deep appreciation for \r\nthe indispensable role of the Agency in encouraging \r\nand assisting the development and practical application \r\nof atomic energy for peaceful uses, in technology \r\ntransfer to developing countries and in nuclear safety, \r\nverification and security, Indonesia is pleased to join \r\nothers in sponsoring draft resolution A/70/L.8 on the \r\nreport of the IAEA. It is a measure of Indonesia’s \r\ndeep appreciation of the Agency’s indispensable role \r\nin encouraging and assisting the development and \r\npractical application of atomic energy for peaceful uses, \r\nin technology transfer to developing countries and in \r\nnuclear safety, verification and security. Indonesia is \r\nready to continue supporting the successful work of the \r\nAgency. \r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nChinese delegation welcomes the report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (see A/70/219), \r\npresented by Director General Yukiya Amano. Over \r\nthe past year, the International Atomic Energy Agency \r\n(IAEA) has effectively discharged its relevant duties \r\nunder its statute. It has exerted substantial efforts and \r\nmade important progress in the areas of promoting the \r\napplication of nuclear energy and technology, nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation, strengthening nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity, and monitoring. In that regard, China would \r\nlike to express its appreciation to the Agency.\r\nThe international community is now gradually \r\nadopting a more rational attitude towards nuclear \r\nenergy. The development of nuclear energy \r\ndemonstrates a generally positive trend and nuclear \r\ntechnologies are being ever more widely applied. \r\nMeanwhile, global nuclear governance is increasingly \r\nexpanding, with the universality of nuclear safeguards \r\nbeing continuously strengthened and global nuclear \r\nsafety and security further enhanced. On the other \r\nhand, nuclear non-proliferation security is still facing \r\na serious situation, and the risks of nuclear terrorism \r\ncannot be ignored. China therefore hopes that the \r\nAgency will focus on the following aspects in its future \r\nwork.\r\nFirst, China encourages the Agency to actively \r\npromote technical cooperation in such areas as the \r\npeaceful application of nuclear energy and technology \r\nand to further assist developing countries in sharing the \r\nbenefits of nuclear development. China looks forward \r\nto the IAES’s early establishment of a modern nuclear \r\napplications laboratory and plans to donate €2 million \r\nin additional contributions to the nuclear application \r\nlaboratory programme.\r\nSecondly, the Agency needs to forge a more effective \r\nand impartial safeguards regime. The application of \r\nsafeguards should first and foremost be objective and \r\nimpartial while also taking effectiveness and efficiency \r\ninto account. China welcomes the progress made by the \r\nIAEA in strengthening the universality of the safeguards \r\nregime and appreciates the efforts by its secretariat to \r\nclarify the State-level concept. We hope that the IAEA \r\nsecretariat will conscientiously fulfil its commitment \r\nto maintaining dialogue and communication with \r\nmember States in that regard by addressing all their \r\nconcerns, with a view to ensuring the impartiality and \r\neffectiveness of the safeguards regime.\r\nThirdly, China welcomes IAEA efforts to \r\nenhance global nuclear safety and security, including \r\nthe improvement of the international legal regime, \r\nthe development of guidelines and the promotion of \r\ncommunication and cooperation in that area. We hope \r\nthat the Agency will continue to play a focused and \r\ncentral role in the relevant international process that \r\nwill replace summits on nuclear security. We have \r\nhigh expectations for positive results next year at the \r\nInternational Conference on Nuclear Security, held \r\nunder the auspices of the IAEA.\r\nFourthly, there needs to be an objective and fair \r\napproach to addressing hotspot nuclear issues. China \r\nappreciates the positive role played by the Agency in \r\nbringing about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \r\non the Iranian nuclear issue. We support the IAEA in its \r\napplication of safeguards and relevant monitoring and \r\nverification measures related in Iran, in accordance with \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2231 (2015) and the Plan of \r\nAction. China hopes that the Agency will strictly abide \r\nby its mandate, continue to maintain an objective and \r\nfair attitude and play a constructive role in promoting \r\nthe peaceful solution of other regional nuclear issues \r\nthrough dialogue and consultations.\r\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of the \r\nbirth of China’s nuclear industry. Thanks to arduous \r\n22/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nefforts over the past six decades, China has registered \r\nsubstantial achievements in its nuclear development. \r\nIts nuclear safety, security and emergency response \r\ncapacity have been further strengthened. China will \r\ncontinue to maintain close cooperation with the \r\nAgency in all the areas of its mandate and will make \r\njoint contributions to realizing the objective of the \r\npeaceful, safe and efficient use of nuclear energy for \r\nall humankind.\r\nMr. Alhakim (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, we extend our condolences to France, Russia, \r\nEgypt and Lebanon. Iraq is one of the countries that \r\nwas targeted by terrorist attacks and suffered loss of \r\nlife on that account.\r\nAt the outset, my delegation would like to welcome \r\nthe annual report of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (see A/70/219), which presents the work and \r\nachievements of the Agency for 2014 in its three main \r\nfields of activity — nuclear technology, nuclear safety \r\nand security and nuclear verification. The report notes \r\nthat there are 438 nuclear reactors in operation in 30 \r\ncountries and 67 new reactors under construction. \r\nThat shows an increasing interest in exercising the \r\ninalienable right, enshrined in article IV of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), \r\nto possess and peacefully use nuclear technology. That \r\nwas also stressed in the Final Document of the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, especially the \r\nneed to respect the decisions and policies of non-nuclear-\r\nweapon-States aimed at acquiring nuclear technology \r\nand nuclear power for peaceful and development \r\npurposes and ensuring the unrestricted peaceful use \r\nof nuclear energy, including through international \r\ncooperation.\r\nThe technical cooperation activities of the Agency \r\nare a priority for my country and for other developing \r\ncountries that want to use nuclear technology in the \r\nareas of health, agriculture, food, water resources, \r\nradio isotopes and radiation. My country is committed \r\nto strengthening capabilities in nuclear safety and \r\nsecurity and in ensuring the physical protection of \r\nnuclear facilities and materials during the stages of \r\nuse, stockpiling and transport — internally or across \r\nborders — in order to avoid radiological or nuclear \r\nincidents and any acts of trafficking. We want to protect \r\nthe lives of people, their property and the environment. \r\nWe therefore submitted a draft integrated action plan \r\non nuclear security to the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) Department of Nuclear Safety and \r\nSecurity and discussed our most vital needs with the \r\nDepartment. \r\nThe Technical Cooperation Programme seeks \r\nto promote and transfer nuclear technology in order \r\nto achieve sustainable soioeconomic development in \r\ndeveloping countries. The Programme remains one of \r\nthe main statutory functions of the Agency. It is the \r\njoint responsibility of the Agency and its member \r\nStates, the concerted efforts of which drastically affect \r\nthe success of the programme, which seeks to meet the \r\ndemands and needs of States.\r\nIf the Programme is to carry out its promotional \r\nactivities, the funding of the Technical Cooperation \r\nFund should be sufficient and assured and at a level \r\ncomparable to that for other Agency activities. Countries \r\nare rightly concerned about monetary contributions \r\nto the Fund, which reflects the need to make funding \r\nsources more predictable. There should be broad and \r\ncareful implementation of any measure that could result \r\nin sanctions or that could impose an extra burden on \r\nthe Agency and the member States, especially countries \r\nunder critical circumstances beyond their control and \r\nthose facing challenges related to the peaceful use of \r\nnuclear energy and radiological applications in fields \r\nsuch as medicine, industry and research. It is necessary \r\nto properly address the issue of the funding shortfalls \r\nexperienced by the Technical Cooperation Fund. \r\nMember States and the Agency should work together \r\nto take appropriate measures to improve the current \r\nsituation.\r\nThe progress achieved in curbing the threat of \r\nnuclear weapons and in improving the effectiveness \r\nof the Comprehensive Safeguards System needs \r\nto be coupled with significant progress in nuclear \r\ndisarmament, in line with the NPT. Countries should \r\nbe encouraged to become party to the NPT in order to \r\nachieve its noble goals in the service of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nInternational and regional efforts have fallen short \r\nof ridding the Middle East of nuclear weapons because \r\nIsrael rejects any endeavour in that regard, despite the \r\nnumerous General Assembly resolutions that have called \r\nfor the elimination of nuclear weapons from the region \r\nsince 1974, as have resolutions adopted by the Review \r\nConferences of the Parties to the NPT. The failure of \r\nthe 2015 NPT Review Conference to reach consensus \r\non the draft final document is a setback in international \r\n15-37040 23/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nefforts to establish in the Middle East a zone free of \r\nnuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction \r\n(WMDs). The failure to adopt a final document has \r\nprevented us from reviewing the obligations over the \r\npast five years. My country therefore stresses the \r\nneed to commit to the resolution of the 1995 Review \r\nand Extension Conference of the Parties to the NPT \r\non the Middle East, which indefinitely extended the \r\nTreaty. The resolution should remain in force until fully \r\nimplemented.\r\nMy Government believes that eliminating nuclear \r\nweapons and other WMDs from the Middle East is a key \r\nelement for achieving peace and security in the Middle \r\nEast. It could be of direct benefit to the development \r\nof the peoples of the region and the prosperity of its \r\ngenerations. In that regard, my delegation stresses the \r\nneed for continued efforts to create such a zone and \r\nto do everything possible to distance this vulnerable \r\nregion from global tension.\r\nMr. Mahmoud (Egypt): At the outset, I wish to \r\nexpress deep appreciation to the representative of \r\nBrazil for introducing draft resolution A/70/L.8 and \r\nto Mr. Yukiya Amano for his comprehensive briefing \r\non the 2014 annual report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (see A/70/219).\r\nThere can be no doubt that the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) comprehensive safeguards \r\nsystem constitutes the only verification mechanism \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT). Egypt believes that all international \r\nefforts aimed at implementing NPT commitments \r\nconcerning nuclear non-proliferation and all efforts \r\ndirected at fulfilling commitments in the field of \r\nnuclear disarmament must indeed be enforced through \r\nthe IAEA verification mechanism, given that it is the \r\nsole international agency with the mandate to perform \r\nthat duty.\r\nWhile we acknowledge the successful role of the \r\nIAEA in ensuring the non-diversion of nuclear activities \r\nor material to military nuclear programmes, that role \r\nhas so far had a limited impact in preventing vertical \r\nproliferation or in verifying nuclear disarmament of the \r\nnuclear-weapon States. Moreover, there is increasing \r\ninterest on the part of non-nuclear-weapon States \r\nin exercising their inalienable right to benefit from \r\npeaceful uses, in accordance with article IV of the NPT. \r\nEgypt stresses the obligation of developed countries in \r\nparticular to promote developing countries’ legitimate \r\naccess to nuclear energy by fully respecting their right \r\nto do so, so that they can reap maximum benefit and \r\nachieve comprehensive sustainable development in \r\ntheir nuclear programmes and relevant applications. \r\nWe therefore consistently emphasize the need to \r\npromote international cooperation in peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy for the realization of the inalienable \r\nright of all parties to the NPT to the development, \r\nresearch, production and use of nuclear energy for \r\npeaceful purposes, which constitutes one of the three \r\nfundamental pillars of the NPT.\r\nAt the national level, Egypt has embarked on the \r\nestablishment of its first nuclear facility for electrical \r\nenergy generation, in response to its increasing \r\ndevelopment needs. We are keen to coordinate with the \r\nIAEA to ensure our compliance with the established \r\nIAEA safety and security standards in all their aspects \r\nand with the comprehensive safeguards system.\r\nEgypt notes with concern certain discriminatory \r\narrangements to impose additional restrictions on some \r\nbut not on others, in a manner that is clearly politicized \r\nand that does not contribute to the implementation \r\nof the NPT objectives, in particular its universality. \r\nMoreover, such restrictions constitute interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of States by attempting to influence \r\nthe determination of their nuclear-energy requirements \r\nor to restrict their right to achieve self-sufficiency in \r\nthe area of nuclear power supply, such as the Additional \r\nProtocol and the international nuclear fuel bank. Egypt \r\ncalls for the universalization of the IAEA comprehensive \r\nsafeguards system as the only legal instrument in this \r\ntechnical field, it being understood that any additional \r\nobligation is a voluntary one and therefore binding only \r\non the States that have acceded to it.\r\nOn the issue of the establishment of a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in the region of the Middle East, \r\nEgypt stresses its determination to mobilize the widest \r\npossible support and endorsement for the two annual \r\ndraft resolutions it introduces in Vienna, entitled \r\n“Application of IAEA safeguards in the Middle East” \r\nand “Israeli nuclear capabilities”, in accordance with \r\nthe 1995 NPT resolution on the Middle East.\r\nMs. Richards (Jamaica): The Jamaican delegation \r\nwelcomes the 2014 annual report of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and thanks Director \r\nGeneral Amano for his presentation on the Agency’s \r\nwork.\r\n24/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nJamaica attaches great importance to the vital work \r\nof the IAEA in promoting the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\ntechnology, fostering nuclear safety and security and in \r\nthe application of a safeguards regime for verification. \r\nWe are therefore pleased to note that the priorities \r\nidentified by the Director General align closely with \r\nJamaica’s priorities. We encourage all fellow Member \r\nStates in a position to do so to continue to contribute \r\nto the technical cooperation fund in order to ensure \r\nthat there are sufficient resources to meet the growing \r\ndemand for the IAEA’s assistance, particularly in the \r\nlight of its increasing membership.\r\nJamaica participated in the fifty-ninth session \r\nof the General Conference of the IAEA, held in \r\nSeptember, which adopted key resolutions and \r\ndecisions in priority areas, including the resolution \r\non strengthening the Agency’s technical cooperation \r\nactivities and the resolutions approving the applications \r\nfrom new members. In that regard, we welcome as new \r\nmembers to the Agency Turkmenistan and two fellow \r\ncountries of the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), \r\nBarbados and Antigua and Barbuda. We are heartened \r\nby the increasing interest from our region in the work \r\nof the IAEA, which attests to the important work of \r\nthe Agency in supporting the application of safe and \r\npeaceful uses of nuclear energy as a tool of development \r\nfor developing countries and for small island developing \r\nStates in particular.\r\nAs we reflect on the newly adopted 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1), we \r\nunderscore the invaluable contribution of the IAEA to \r\nsustainable development, which is evident in the direct \r\nrelevance of at least three of the Goals to the mandate \r\nof the Agency, namely, Goal 3, on health; Goal 6, on the \r\nsustainable management of water and sanitation; and \r\nGoal 7, on access to affordable, reliable, sustainable \r\nand modern energy. Having benefited significantly \r\nfrom the Agency’s technical cooperation activities, \r\nJamaica maintains a strong interest in the IAEA’s \r\nprogrammes and welcomes the thrust by the Agency \r\nto synergize national development priorities and the \r\nIAEA’s assistance within the broader United Nations \r\ndevelopment assistance framework.\r\nWe wish to express our gratitude for the emergency \r\nand response preparedness mission to Jamaica in July, \r\nwhich appraised our readiness to act in the event of \r\nan emergency associated with the operation of our \r\nSlowpoke II research reactor. We welcome the mission \r\nteam’s report and note the recommendations and \r\nsuggestions for our continued work. In the field of \r\nresearch and technology, we have embarked on a project \r\nin partnership with the IAEA, Canada and the United \r\nStates aimed at converting the fuel used in our nuclear \r\nresearch reactor from highly enriched uranium to low-\r\nenriched uranium, thereby decreasing non-proliferation \r\nrisks while doubling the reactor’s utilization capacity.\r\nWe express appreciation to the IAEA and the \r\nGovernments of Canada and the United States for the \r\nassistance being given to Jamaica, in particular under \r\nthe Peaceful Uses Initiative. The additional capacity \r\nwill allow us to expand research work related to food \r\nsafety, food security and air quality. Moreover, with the \r\nadditional capacity provided to the Caribbean’s only \r\nresearch reactor, we will be able to accommodate the \r\nresearch needs of other countries from the Caribbean. In \r\nthat regard, the critical role of the Regional Cooperation \r\nAgreement for the Promotion of Nuclear Science and \r\nTechnology in Latin America and the Caribbean must \r\nbe emphasized. Jamaica sees the Agreement as an \r\nimportant mechanism for technical cooperation in the \r\nregion and to that end is currently advancing domestic \r\narrangements to join in the first extension of the \r\nAgreement.\r\nA priority area of development to which technical \r\ncooperation has been directed is the area of human \r\nhealth. We consider the use of nuclear medicine to \r\nbe critical. Moreover, Jamaica sees a productive and \r\nhealthy workforce as fundamental to our development, \r\nand we welcome the contribution of the IAEA to meeting \r\nthat development objective through the implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action for Cancer Therapy and \r\nthe current programme to re-establish public nuclear-\r\nmedicine services in Jamaica.\r\nJamaica is pleased to report that, in July of this \r\nyear, our Parliament adopted the Nuclear Safety and \r\nRadiation Act, which provides a legal framework for the \r\nregulation of activities, practices and facilities involving \r\nradiation and nuclear technology. This new legislation is \r\naimed at protecting human health and the environment \r\nwhile harnessing the benefits of nuclear technology. \r\nIn addition, we continue to work with the IAEA on \r\nissues relating to the safe transportation of radioactive \r\nmaterials, given the fundamental importance of such \r\nmaterials to health care and to industry in general. More \r\nrecently, the IAEA has cooperated with CARICOM’s \r\nprogramme for the implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1540 (2004) by staging a special initiative \r\ntargeting CARICOM member States, with a focus on \r\n15-37040 25/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nthe safe transportation of nuclear materials. The main \r\nrationale for that initiative, which commenced in June \r\n2014, is to address the deficit of regulatory mechanisms \r\nwithin CARlCOM member States, in order to ensure \r\nthe safe transportation of nuclear and radiological \r\nmaterials commonly used in several development-\r\nrelated domains, particularly in the health sector.\r\nAs the Agency seeks to accelerate and enlarge \r\nthe contribution of nuclear energy to peace, health \r\nand prosperity, Jamaica renews its commitment to the \r\ngoal of the safe and effective uses of that technology \r\nfor the global good. To that end, we pledge our full \r\ncooperation and support for the work of the Agency in \r\ncollaboration with other members and partners, towards \r\nthe fulfilment of its mandate.\r\nMr. Alokly (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): After \r\nconsidering the report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (see A/70/219), my delegation would \r\nlike to express its appreciation to the secretariat of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), in \r\nparticular its Department of Technical Cooperation, \r\nwhich has given us a great deal of support, in particular \r\nin the fields of health, water-resource management and \r\neducation, fields that are priorities for us at the national \r\nlevel. My delegation affirms the right of developing \r\ncountries to benefit from the peaceful uses of nuclear \r\npower and to receive nuclear technology, to share \r\nnuclear knowledge and to benefit from the transfer of \r\nnuclear technology.\r\nLibya’s position is very clear with respect to taking \r\npractical steps to support the IAEA and to maintain \r\nits credibility. We will implement the three pillars \r\nof the work of the IAEA. Moreover, we affirm our \r\ncommitment to implementing the Additional Protocol \r\nand encourage countries that have not yet done so \r\nto accede to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons (NPT). We also confirm that we will \r\nrespect all the international instruments to which we \r\nhave acceded in the past.\r\nWe commend the international measures that the \r\nIAEA takes to encourage cooperation in the peaceful \r\nuses of nuclear energy. We have acceded to a number \r\nof international instruments in that sphere and have \r\nestablished an office for nuclear safeguards that we \r\nintend to transform into an independent verification \r\nand monitoring authority, in line with international and \r\nnational legislation and the statute of the IAEA. We \r\nalso commend the work of the IAEA in its efforts to \r\nend the use of nuclear weapons for terrorist purposes.\r\nIt has been 20 years since the Final Document of \r\nthe 1995 NPT Review Conference was adopted and the \r\ndecision was taken to establish a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone in the Middle East. That decision was confirmed \r\nin the Final Document of the 2010 NPT Review \r\nConference, which stated that the NPT would remain \r\nvalid until its aims were achieved. We were therefore \r\nboth shocked and disappointed by the failure of the \r\n2015 NPT Review Conference. In that respect, we call \r\nupon the Secretary-General and the three sponsoring \r\ncountries to make every possible effort to free the \r\nMiddle East of nuclear weapons and to make up for the \r\nfailure of the 2015 Conference.\r\nOur delegation calls on all countries possessing \r\nnuclear weapons to begin the process of disarming and \r\nceasing all programmes aimed at their development, in \r\naccordance with article VI of the NPT, as reaffirmed \r\nduring the Conferences of 2000 and 2010. At those \r\nConferences, it was stressed that the nuclear-weapon \r\nStates parties to the NPT had the obligation to abandon \r\nnuclear weapons because those weapons represent an \r\nacute danger to the world, and countries with nuclear \r\nweapons must assume that responsibility. Otherwise, \r\nthe goal of establishing nuclear-weapon-free zones \r\nwould be meaningless.\r\nMr. Al Musharakh (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, the United Arab Emirates \r\nrecognizes the importance of solidarity in facing and \r\ncombating terrorism in all its forms.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe United Arab Emirates welcomes the report \r\n(see A/70/219) of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) and recognizes the central and \r\ncrucial role of the IAEA in regard to the peaceful \r\nuse of nuclear technology, which serves both the \r\nadvancement of national nuclear-power programmes \r\nand other non-power applications. We believe that the \r\nAgency plays a fundamental role in supporting the \r\nexchange of scientific knowledge and nuclear expertise \r\namong its member States. The United Arab Emirates \r\nreiterates its commitment to working closely with the \r\nIAEA and abides by its standards, as underlined in the \r\nGovernment’s nuclear policy principles.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates is among the IAEA \r\nmember States that are developing a civil nuclear-\r\n26/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\npower programme, with a scheduled operation date \r\nfor its first reactor in the year 2017. Since launching \r\nits nuclear programme at the national level, the United \r\nArab Emirates has made significant progress in the \r\ndevelopment of its details and associated infrastructure. \r\nThere are currently four nuclear-power reactor units \r\nunder construction at the Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, \r\nwith a little more than 75 per cent of the first unit \r\ncompleted. In making such progress, the United Arab \r\nEmirates views the Agency as a valuable partner, from \r\nwhich it receives guidance and the necessary support, \r\nand to whose achievements it contributes in return.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates continues to attach the \r\nutmost importance to nuclear safety and supports the \r\nefforts of the international community in ensuring and \r\nstrengthening nuclear safety. The work of the IAEA is \r\nparticularly relevant in achieving that goal. My country \r\ncommends the Agency’s efforts in producing the report \r\non the Fukushima Daiichi accident and believes that it \r\nwill be of great value in developing other programmes \r\nat the Agency, including peer reviews and standards \r\nwork, among others.\r\nIn regard to measures to strengthen the country’s \r\nnuclear safety infrastructure, the United Arab Emirates \r\ncontinues to benefit from the Agency’s review services. \r\nTo date, the United Arab Emirates has received \r\nnumerous review missions examining various areas \r\nof nuclear infrastructure, nuclear security, emergency \r\nplanning and the nuclear-safety framework. To that \r\nend, the IAEA’s efforts in supporting the responsible \r\nglobal development of nuclear power is highly valuable. \r\nThat includes convening high-level conferences on \r\nnuclear power, which has been an important part of \r\nthe Agency’s work. The United Arab Emirates looks \r\nforward to hosting the next International Conference on \r\nNuclear Power in 2017 in Abu Dhabi. The United Arab \r\nEmirates will make available its long and successful \r\nexperience in hosting international and high-profile \r\nevents.\r\nMy country commends the Director General’s \r\nefforts in strengthening the Agency’s Technical \r\nCooperation Programme activities. We remain \r\nsupportive of the Agency’s approach in tailoring \r\ntechnical cooperation projects to the needs of the \r\nmember States, which maintain their ownership of the \r\nrespective programmes. The United Arab Emirates \r\nbelieves that the IAEA has a central role in promoting \r\nnuclear security through the promotion of cooperation \r\nand the sharing of best practices. The IAEA is well \r\nsuited to coordinating international efforts, because \r\nnuclear security is not isolated from other nuclear \r\nmatters under its auspices. My country has subscribed \r\nto and continues to implement all relevant international \r\ninstruments with the objective of enhancing nuclear \r\nsecurity at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels.\r\nAs a country that has approved the Amendment to \r\nthe Convention on the Physical Protection of Nuclear \r\nMaterial, the United Arab Emirates welcomes the \r\nprogress made in the number of countries that have \r\nalso approved it and looks forward to its early entry \r\ninto force. Additionally, my country recognizes the \r\nimportance of the IAEA system as a verification \r\nmechanism and supports its continued development to \r\naddress the challenges, meet the objectives and provide \r\ncredible assurances.\r\nIn conclusion, the United Arab Emirates looks \r\nforward to its continued cooperation with the IAEA and \r\nthe international community to ensure the responsible, \r\nsafe and transparent use of nuclear energy. My delegation \r\nexpresses its appreciation to the Director General and \r\nthe secretariat of the IAEA for the tremendous work \r\nand achievements that the Agency has accomplished, as \r\nreflected in the 2014 annual report.\r\nMr. Sergeyev (Ukraine): Because this is my first \r\nstatement after the terrible events in Paris, I would like \r\nto express the position of my delegation.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nMy delegation is deeply shocked by the terrorist \r\nattacks in Paris. We express our profound and sincere \r\ncondolences to the French people. It is our shared \r\ntragedy. That horrible crime must be punished by all \r\npossible means.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nUkraine supports the activities of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA) in promoting the use of \r\nnuclear energy for peaceful purposes. We view all the \r\nactivities of the IAEA in a positive light in all its main \r\nstatutory areas: nuclear safety and security, nuclear \r\nscience, technology applications, safeguards and nuclear \r\nverification. The Agency contributes significantly to \r\nachieving global development goals. We acknowledge \r\nthe central role of the Agency in strengthening the global \r\nnuclear-safety framework. Accidents at the Chernobyl \r\nand Fukushima Daiichi nuclear-power plants triggered \r\nthe revision of international safety standards. To ensure \r\n15-37040 27/28\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.55\r\nthe highest safety level for nuclear waste and radiation \r\nworldwide, we are convinced that the use and further \r\ndevelopment of nuclear power should be undertaken in \r\nstrict compliance with safety standards and regulations. \r\nUkraine, which has 15 operating nuclear power units in \r\none of the largest nuclear power programmes in Europe, \r\nfully shares that approach.\r\nWe reiterate our strong support for the Agency’s \r\nTechnical Cooperation Programme. Ukraine values \r\nthe Programme’s role in the responsible development \r\nof peaceful applications of nuclear technology in the \r\nareas of human health, food and agriculture, water \r\nmanagement, and the strengthening of nuclear and \r\nradiation safety. The Programme serves as a powerful \r\ntool for the exchange of nuclear knowledge and capacity-\r\nbuilding in member States. IAEA regional and national \r\ntechnical cooperation projects have significantly \r\ncontributed to nuclear safety and improving the overall \r\neffectiveness of the peaceful use of nuclear energy in \r\nUkraine.\r\nDuring 2014-2015, Ukraine implemented a \r\nnumber of IAEA projects in such areas as supporting \r\nradioactive-waste management and nuclear-power-\r\nplant decommissioning, developing decontamination, \r\nrecultivation and reconstruction infrastructure for \r\nexisting uranium mines and former uranium-production \r\nfacilities, defining safety goals and regulatory \r\nstrategies for newly built and long-time operating \r\nnuclear-power plants and strengthening of a secondary \r\nstandards dosimetry laboratory for radiation therapy \r\ndosimetry. We continue to support ongoing regional \r\nprojects for Europe aimed at facilitating the return \r\nto normal radiological environmental conditions for \r\nthe territories affected by the Chernobyl accident and \r\nsupporting decommissioning and waste management \r\nfor Chernobyl, Ignalina and A-1 nuclear-power plants. \r\nUkraine stands ready to actively cooperate with \r\nthe Agency during the next Technical Cooperation \r\nProgramme cycle in 2016-2017.\r\nUkraine highly appreciates the work of the Agency \r\nin preparing the part of the report (see A/70/219) devoted \r\nto the Fukushima Daiichi accident, which presents an \r\nauthoritative, factual and balanced assessment of the \r\ncauses and consequences of the accident as well as \r\nthe lessons learned. Ukraine recognizes the Agency’s \r\nleading role in the field of nuclear non-proliferation. The \r\nIAEA safeguards are a set of technical measures that \r\nallow the IAEA to independently verify a State’s legal \r\ncommitment to using nuclear material and facilities \r\nonly for peaceful purposes. In this regard, we continue \r\nto call upon all States to adopt the IAEA comprehensive \r\nsafeguards agreement and the additional protocol. We \r\nconfirm our support for the activities of the Agency \r\naimed at strengthening the effectiveness and improving \r\nthe efficiency of the safeguards system and welcome \r\nthe efforts of the Agency with a view to preventing \r\nthe diversion of nuclear energy from peaceful uses to \r\nmilitary purposes.\r\nUkraine does not recognize the illegitimately \r\nproclaimed Republic of Crimea and its illegal annexation \r\nby the Russian Federation as a constituent entity. By \r\nadopting resolution 68/262 of 27 March 2014, on the \r\nterritorial integrity of Ukraine, the GeneralAssembly \r\naffirmed its commitment to the sovereignty, political \r\nindependence, unity and territorial integrity of \r\nUkraine within its internationally recognized borders. \r\nThe Assembly also called on all States, international \r\norganizations and specialized agencies not to recognize, \r\neither directly or indirectly, any alteration of the status \r\nof the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of \r\nSevastopol. Ukraine retains jurisdiction over all nuclear \r\nfacilities and materials, including the research reactor \r\nIR-100 and other nuclear facilities of the Sevastopol \r\nNational University of Nuclear Energy and Industry, \r\nwhich are the property of Ukraine and currently located \r\nin the temporarily occupied territory.\r\nThe provisions of the 1995 Agreement between \r\nUkraine and the IAEA for the application of safeguards \r\nin connection with the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons and the 2000 Additional Protocol \r\nthereto remain fully in effect and apply to the nuclear \r\nfacilities and materials in Ukraine, including those \r\nlocated in the temporarily occupied territory of the \r\nAutonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of \r\nSevastopol. In this regard, Ukraine supports the position \r\nof the United Nations Office of Legal Affairs, which \r\nprovided guidelines to legal advisers in the United \r\nNations system on how to comply with resolution \r\n68/262, stating, among other things, that treaties to \r\nwhich Ukraine is a party remain applicable to the entire \r\nterritory of Ukraine, including Crimea.\r\nUkraine welcomes the principled position \r\nthe Agency has taken in continuing to implement \r\nsafeguards in Ukraine in accordance with Ukraine’s \r\nComprehensive Safeguards Agreement and Additional \r\nProtocol thereto. Consequently, all facilities and \r\nnuclear material in Crimea continue to be covered by \r\nthe Agreement between Ukraine and the Agency, as \r\n28/28 15-37040\r\nA/70/PV.55 17/11/2015\r\nstated by the Director of the Office of Legal Affairs of \r\nthe IAEA secretariat on 10 June 2015 and in the note \r\nverbale of the IAEA secretariat dated 22 September \r\n2014. Ukraine welcomes the secretariat’s conclusion, \r\ncontained in the safeguards implementation report of \r\n2014, that it has found no indication of the diversion \r\nof declared nuclear material from peaceful nuclear \r\nactivities and no indication of undeclared nuclear \r\nmaterial or activities in Ukraine. In confirming the \r\nbroad conclusion for Ukraine, the IAEA secretariat \r\nonce again stressed that the IAEA safeguards apply \r\nto all nuclear material located throughout the territory \r\nof Ukraine, including the Autonomous Republic of \r\nCrimea and the city of Sevastopol, in accordance with \r\nUkraine’s Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement and \r\nthe Additional Protocol thereto.\r\nThe IAEA did not undertake on-site verification \r\nactivity in 2014 at the IR-100 research reactor and \r\nthe subcritical uranium water assembly located at the \r\nSevastopol National University of Nuclear Energy and \r\nIndustry of Ukraine because of the external aggression \r\nof the neighbouring State — aggression that resulted \r\nin the illegal occupation and annexation of an integral \r\npart of Ukraine’s territory by the Russian Federation. \r\nWe call on the Russian Federation to abide by the \r\ntenets of international law and reverse the annexation \r\nof the Autonomous Republic of Crimea. This will \r\nprovide appropriate access for the IAEA to the nuclear \r\nfacilities and material of Ukraine under Ukraine’s \r\nComprehensive Safeguards Agreement.\r\nUkraine fully supports draft resolution A/70/L.8, \r\non the report of the IAEA, which was initially prepared \r\nby the Agency secretariat. It was elaborated in a factual \r\nand unbiased manner, based on the IAEA statute and \r\nthe Agreement governing the relationship between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Agency.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to join in supporting \r\nthe annual report for 2014 and express our sincere \r\nappreciation for the efforts of IAEA Director \r\nGeneral Yukiya Amano and the Agency secretariat in \r\nencouraging and assisting the development and practical \r\napplication of atomic energy for peaceful uses.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.05 p.m.\r\n"
