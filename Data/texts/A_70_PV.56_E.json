Argentina believes that the Agency \r\nplays a very important role in international cooperation \r\nfor scientific and technological development in the \r\nnuclear field and non-proliferation.\r\nArgentina stresses the technical and procedural \r\nnature of the draft resolution (A/70/L.8), which does \r\nnot introduce distorting political elements. We thank \r\nthe Federative Republic of Brazil for its efforts..\r\nThe efficiency of the Agency’s verification system \r\nwith regard to nuclear activities is fundamental for \r\nachieving the non-proliferation objectives. Our country \r\nhas steadily maintained that the central matter of \r\nthe future design of the nuclear security architecture \r\nshould be the responsibility of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency, as it is the relevant body of the United \r\nNations system in the area of the peaceful uses of \r\nnuclear energy.\r\nArgentina believes that one of the pillars of the \r\nAgency’s work is nuclear and radiation security and \r\nthe safe transport and management of radioactive \r\nwaste — areas that my country considers very \r\nimportant. A central objective of the Agency is to foster \r\nand encourage international cooperation on nuclear \r\nissues, and Argentina has continuously contributed \r\nwith various programmes and activities.\r\nInternational safeguards constitute another pillar of \r\nthe Agency. Along with nuclear and radiation security, \r\nthey are especially important for facilitating nuclear \r\ndevelopment. My country reiterates its conviction that \r\nthose guarantees should be developed in an atmosphere \r\nof cooperation and dialogue between the Agency and \r\nthe States.\r\nArgentina believes that joint efforts are necessary \r\nin order to generate stronger nuclear infrastructures \r\nthat are more solid, efficient and sustainable over time.\r\nMrs. Natividad (Philippines): On behalf of the \r\nPhilippine Government and the Filipino people, allow \r\nme to express our solidarity with and sympathy to the \r\npeople of Beirut and Paris in this time of great sorrow \r\nfollowing the recent terrorist attacks that killed hundreds \r\nof people. We stand in solidarity with the international \r\ncommunity in condemning those horrific attacks and in \r\nthe fight against terrorism. It is urgent, now more than \r\never, to bolster the global non-proliferation regime so \r\nthat terrorists are not able to possess nuclear weapons \r\nor weapons of mass destruction.\r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.56\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n56th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 17 November 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/7 15-37314\r\nA/70/PV.56 17/11/2015\r\nIn the face of those threats, the Philippines recalls \r\nthe recent assistance provided by the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency (IAEA), as well as the United \r\nStates Department of Energy, in strengthening the \r\nPhilippines’ nuclear security measures to ensure the \r\nsecurity of all our visitors and nationals within our \r\nborders. For that, the Philippines is most grateful.\r\nThe Philippines welcomes the report of the \r\nAgency for the year 2014 (see A/70/219) and lauds the \r\ncontinuing balanced manner in which its objectives \r\nhave been pursued and implemented. The IAEA’s active \r\ninvolvement in the deliberations for the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) is also \r\nworth noting and commending. There is no doubt that \r\nnuclear science and technology will play a crucial role \r\nin the achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, such as in the areas of health, energy, water, \r\nagriculture and food security and climate change, to \r\nname but a few.\r\nThe Philippines has tremendously benefited from \r\nthe Agency’s Technical Cooperation Programme over \r\nthe years. IAEA Director General Yukiya Amano was \r\nin the Philippines in January to witness the country’s \r\nlatest advances in nuclear science and technology. \r\nOur electron-beam irradiation facility, which was \r\nestablished with the Agency’s assistance, is now fully \r\noperational and is handling the grafting of abaca fibres \r\nto produce metal adsorbents and honey alginate for the \r\ndressing of wounds.\r\nNext month, the Philippines will hold its third \r\nNuclear Congress, which will provide a useful platform \r\nfor the exchange of information on the current state of \r\nglobal, regional and national applications in nuclear \r\nscience and technology for development and inclusive \r\ngrowth.\r\nIn the area of nuclear safety, the Philippines \r\nwelcomes the approval by the IAEA Board of Governors \r\nof the six new safety requirements, which will be \r\nestablished as safety standards in an effort to further \r\nstrengthen the global nuclear safety framework.\r\nWe also support the establishment of the Emergency \r\nPreparedness and Response Standards Committee and \r\nintend to participate actively in its work. The Philippines \r\nalso commends the IAEA’s report on the Fukushima \r\nDaiichi accident, which was the product of extensive \r\ninternational collaboration among experts from 42 \r\nmember States, including my country. The Philippines \r\nis working with the IAEA to enhance its capability to \r\ncope with nuclear or radiological emergencies through \r\nthe establishment of an online environmental radiation \r\nmonitoring system, comprising initially five stations.\r\nOn nuclear security, the Agency is assisting us \r\nin setting up a nuclear security support centre. The \r\nEuropean Commission Joint Research Centre and the \r\nUnited States Department of Energy are also providing \r\na radiation portal monitor for training front-line and \r\nborder control officers.\r\nThe Philippines is also an active partner in the \r\nimplementation of the Integrated Nuclear Security \r\nSupport Plan. To strengthen cooperation among our \r\nvarious Government agencies in the field of nuclear \r\nsecurity, we convened a workshop on threat assessment \r\nand design basis threat in April.\r\nThe Philippines welcomes the Joint Comprehensive \r\nPlan of Action (JCPOA) agreed to by the E3/EU+3 \r\nand Iran, as well as Security Council resolution 2231 \r\n(2015) endorsing the JCPOA. The Philippines calls for \r\nfull compliance with that agreement and the resolution \r\nof outstanding and remaining issues. We also look \r\nforward to the December 2015 report of the Director \r\nGeneral, which will provide the final assessment on \r\nthe resolution of all past and present outstanding issues \r\nconcerning Iran’s nuclear programme of action by the \r\nBoard of Governors.\r\nThe Philippines also continues to urge the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to abandon all \r\nits nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programmes, \r\nto return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons and to fully comply with IAEA \r\nsafeguards and relevant Security Council resolutions.\r\nIn closing, allow me to reiterate the Philippines’ \r\nstrong commitment to the work of the IAEA and to \r\ncontributing, as a member of the Board of Governors \r\nfor 2015-2016, to improving the Agency’s operations \r\nand looking into ways that nuclear science and \r\ntechnology can improve people’s lives and contribute \r\nto the achievement of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nMr. Moselle (United States of America): The United \r\nStates fully supports the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA) and the great breadth of work reflected \r\nin the IAEA’s 2014 annual report (see A/70/219). We \r\nwould also like to thank Director General Amano for \r\nhis leadership.\r\nFor many years we have joined the consensus \r\nin this forum on the draft resolution before us today \r\n15-37314 3/7\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.56\r\n(A/70/L.8), expressing our strong collective support for \r\nthe IAEA and its work.\r\nThe IAEA annual report for 2014 is the report \r\nof the IAEA Board of Governors mandated by the \r\nIAEA Statute. It was approved by the IAEA General \r\nConference without reservations, in accordance \r\nwith the IAEA Statute. It is submitted to the General \r\nAssembly in accordance with the United Nations/IAEA \r\nrelationship. \r\nIt is a shame that this routine resolution of support \r\nfor the IAEA should be politicized. We were similarly \r\ndisappointed by Russia’s efforts to suggest changes to \r\nthe 2014 IAEA annual report when it was considered \r\nby the Board of Governors in Vienna. Russia’s position \r\nis a clear attempt to amend technical IAEA documents, \r\nincluding this annual report, to imply recognition of \r\nRussia’s attempted annexation of Crimea. Those efforts \r\nare inconsistent with resolution 68/262 on Crimea’s \r\nsovereignty, and they were roundly rejected in Vienna. \r\nCrimea remains an integral part of Ukraine. Ultimately, \r\nthe IAEA Board of Governors, subsequent to the IAEA \r\nGeneral Conference, made it clear that such political \r\nefforts had no place in a technical document from a \r\ntechnical agency.\r\nWe commend Brazil’s efforts with regard to the \r\ndraft resolution, and we stand with Brazil as a sponsor. \r\nWe encourage all States to join us in supporting the \r\ndraft resolution, as we have done in years past.\r\nMr. Špokauskas (Lithuania): Let me thank the \r\nDirector General of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency (IAEA), Mr. Yukiya Amano, for his presentation \r\nof the Agency’s annual report (see A/70/219) and the \r\nupdate on its activities in 2015. \r\nLithuania is pleased to co-sponsor and will vote in \r\nfavour of the draft resolution on the report of the IAEA \r\n(A/70/L.8), reaffirming the indispensable role of the \r\nAgency with regard to non-proliferation and the use of \r\natomic energy for peaceful purposes, as well as nuclear \r\nverification, safety and security. We thank Brazil for \r\nits skilful guidance in the difficult negotiations on this \r\nimportant draft resolution.\r\nLithuania associates itself fully with the statement \r\nmade on behalf of the European Union (see A/70/\r\nPV.55).\r\nNuclear energy is a viable solution in the face of \r\nthe challenges facing the international community \r\narising from climate change and the need to ensure \r\nenergy security. Yet nuclear energy has a future \r\nonly if developed in the most responsible way and in \r\nconformity with the spirit and letter of the international \r\nsafety standards and requirements. Lithuania \r\nappreciates the role of the IAEA in setting high nuclear \r\nsafety standards through the constant improvement of \r\nregulations, assistance in implementation and efforts to \r\nfoster the concept of safety culture.\r\nThe comments by the Russian delegation with regard \r\nto the IAEA report and the nuclear facilities on the \r\nCrimean peninsula (see A/70/PV.55) are disconcerting \r\nand do not reflect reality. Lithuania is concerned that \r\nthe work of the Agency is being politicized by bringing \r\nup the issue of the illegal occupation and annexation \r\nof Crimea by the Russian Federation. We regard that \r\nas a detrimental attempt to influence the work of the \r\nAgency, which is an independent and technical agency. \r\nThe position of the Assembly regarding Crimea is \r\nvery clear. Resolution 68/262 affirms its commitment \r\nto the sovereignty, political independence, unity and \r\nterritorial integrity of Ukraine within the internationally \r\nrecognized borders. Crimea remains part of Ukraine, \r\nand its illegal annexation constituted a breach of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and its principles.\r\nMoreover, the decision of the IAEA to classify \r\nall nuclear facilities in Sevastopol, including \r\nresearch reactor IR-100, as belonging to Ukraine was \r\ncompletely in line with resolution 68/262, which calls \r\nupon all international organizations and specialized \r\nagencies not to recognize any alteration in the status \r\nof the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of \r\nSevastopol and to refrain from any action that might be \r\ninterpreted as recognizing any such altered status.\r\nFor those reasons, Lithuania urges all Member \r\nStates to maintain their support for the draft resolution, \r\nas in previous years.\r\nMr. An Myong Hun (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to state its position on \r\na nuclear issue that was mentioned in a prejudicial \r\nmanner in the annual report of the International Atomic \r\nEnergy Agency (IAEA) (see A/70/219).\r\nThe nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is \r\nthe direct product of the hostile policy of the United \r\nStates and its nuclear threats against the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. If the United States had \r\nnot acted with hostility against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and had not threatened it with its \r\n4/7 15-37314\r\nA/70/PV.56 17/11/2015\r\nnuclear weapons, the nuclear issue would never have \r\nbeen created on the Korean peninsula. Since the \r\nnuclear issue of the Korean peninsula was created by \r\nthe United States, its solution will depend entirely upon \r\nthe United States terminating its hostile policy against \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nNevertheless, each year, the IAEA presents \r\nits partial and unjust report and draft resolution, \r\nintentionally following the hostile policy of the United \r\nStates against the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. If the IAEA sincerely wants a solution to the \r\nnuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, it should call \r\nto account the United States, which created the nuclear \r\nissue and constantly threatens the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea with its nuclear weapons.\r\nHowever, the IAEA report mentions the nuclear \r\nissue of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nonly in a discriminatory manner, without mentioning \r\neven one word about the nuclear threat and blackmail \r\nby the United States. The attitude of the IAEA cannot \r\nbe construed otherwise than as being unfair, which is \r\nfar short of impartiality in its work. It is none other than \r\nthe IAEA that in the past created suspicion regarding \r\nthe peaceful nuclear activities of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, at the instigation of the \r\nUnited States; and none other than the United States \r\nand the IAEA that compelled the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea to take self-defensive action by \r\nwithdrawing from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons.\r\nThe IAEA should learn a lesson from having \r\nproduced such unprecedented serious consequences by \r\nblindly followed the hostile policy of the United States \r\nagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. \r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea takes this opportunity to urge the IAEA not to \r\nblindly follow the hostile policy of the United States \r\nany longer. The IAEA should bear in mind that the \r\nannual submission of this kind of report, which is full \r\nof prejudice and distortions, does not at all help address \r\nthe issue.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\nnever recognized the relevant resolutions of the IAEA \r\nBoard of Governors, not to speak of the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions. \r\nAs long as the United States’ extremely hostile \r\npolicy against the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea continues, no solution can be expected with \r\nregard to the nuclear issue or to the peace and security \r\nof the Korean peninsula and beyond.\r\nThe aggressive joint nuclear military exercises \r\nstaged every year by the United States in South Korea, \r\ndespite strong condemnation of the international \r\nsociety constitute concrete manifestations of the United \r\nStates’ hostile policy against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. As long as United States continues \r\nto infringe upon the sovereignty and dignity of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and drives dark \r\nclouds of nuclear war towards the Korean peninsula, \r\nthe nuclear issue cannot be solved. On the contrary, \r\nsuch actions will only lead to the further modernization \r\nand qualitative and quantitative improvements of the \r\nnuclear deterrent capability of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nAs has already been clarified, the nuclear power \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea serves \r\nto deter attacks and aggression against the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, defend the nation’s security \r\nand safeguard the peace and security of the region. The \r\nnuclear power of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea does not constitute a threat to non-nuclear-\r\nweapon States that are not engaged in attacks or \r\naggression against the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea will \r\nfulfil its obligations assumed before the international \r\ncommunity with a high sense of responsibility as a \r\nnuclear-weapon State.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): There is universal agreement that the real \r\nnuclear threat in the Middle East is Israel’s possession \r\nof nuclear weapons, including long-range missiles that \r\ncan threaten the whole region and, with their range of \r\n5,000 miles, can even reach the Chinese border. \r\nYet some do not recognize that obvious fact, \r\npreferring to draw attention to other, illusionary issues \r\nin order to avoid any focus on the real threat resulting \r\nfrom Israel’s nuclear reality. This tendency lacks \r\nintegrity and objectivity and unveils their allegations \r\nwhen they espress keenness to establish a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone in the Middle East. For decades they \r\nprovided Israel with nuclear technology and material \r\nthat enabled it to acquire nuclear weapons, including \r\nadvanced submarines capable of carrying and \r\nlaunching nuclear missiles. They have done their best, \r\nquite illogically, to keep the international community \r\n15-37314 5/7\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.56\r\nfrom focusing on that important issue during the \r\nReview Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), which \r\nwere held in 2010 and 2015 in New York. They also \r\nworked to thwart the 2012 Conference on a nuclear-\r\nfree zone in the Middle East in order to help conceal \r\nthe fact Israel was still acquiring a nuclear weapon at \r\nthe expense of the safety and security of the peoples in \r\nthe region, proving once again their policy of double \r\nstandards.\r\nIn his statement, the Director General of the \r\nIAEA referred to the fact that the Agency had recently \r\nconcluded that it was highly probable that a building \r\ndestroyed at Dair Alzour was a nuclear reactor, which \r\nshould have been declared to the Agency. In that \r\ncontext, please allow me to state the following.\r\nFirst, the Director General of the IAEA knows quite \r\nwell that Syria made the non-proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons one of its national priorities in both words and \r\ndeeds. Therefore, early on, back in 1968, Syria started \r\nby acceding to the NPT. It also signed the Safeguards \r\nAgreements with the Agency in 1992. Moreover, on \r\n27 December 2003, Syria, on behalf of the Group of \r\nArab States, submitted to the Security Council a draft \r\nresolution on the topic that is still in blue. That draft \r\nsought to establish a zone free of nuclear weapons and \r\nall other weapons of mass destruction in the Middle \r\nEast. All of that underscores the fact that the credibility \r\nof our national commitment to non-proliferation cannot \r\nbe questioned. That is particularly the case since that \r\ndraft, which is in line with the provisions and objectives \r\nof the IAEA, met with the objection of the United States \r\nof America, which threatened to use the veto against it.\r\nSecond, the Security Council and the IAEA did \r\nnot condemn the Israeli military aggression against \r\nSyria or Israel’s refusal to cooperate with the Agency, \r\nnor did the Council allow Agency inspectors to inspect \r\nthe pollution that is potentially due to the Israeli \r\nmissiles and the materials used to destroy and pollute \r\nthat site. We must also take into consideration Israel’s \r\ncontinued refusal to cooperate with IAEA requests, its \r\nongoing development of its nuclear military capabilities \r\nbeyond any international supervision or control and its \r\ndisregard for all calls to turn the Middle East into a \r\nzone free of nuclear weapons.\r\nAll of this threatens the credibility of the \r\nNon-Proliferation Treaty and the safety and security \r\nof the States and the peoples in the Middle East and \r\nundermines the universality of the Treaty. Those are \r\nvery dangerous issues. The facts have been corroborated \r\nand documented, and are known to the IAEA. We \r\nexpected the Director General of the IAEA to refer to \r\nthose facts in his statement instead of using expressions \r\ndevoid of any real meaning, such as “It was very likely \r\nthat...”.\r\nThird, it would be useful here to read a paragraph \r\nfrom the memoirs of Mr. Mohamed ElBaradei, the \r\nprevious Director General of the IAEA, entitled The \r\nAge of Deception: Nuclear Diplomacy in Treacherous \r\nTimes. I quote from pages 228 and 229:\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“One of the strangest and most striking example \r\nof nuclear hypocrisy, multilateral and multifaceted, \r\nmust surely be Israel’s bombing of the Dair Alzour \r\ninstallation in Syria in September 2007, and the \r\naftermath of that attack. Speculation began almost \r\nimmediately that the site had housed a nuclear \r\nfacility. Syria denied the accusations. Israel and the \r\nUnited States remained officially silent, although \r\nAmerican officials spoke anonymously on the \r\nsubject to the media. I spoke out strongly, noting \r\nthat any country with information indicating that \r\nthe bombed facility was nuclear was under a legal \r\nobligation to report it to the IAEA. But no one \r\ncame forward with such a report. For the six weeks \r\nfollowing the bombing, the most crucial period \r\nin terms of our seeing inside the facility, we were \r\nunable to obtain any high resolution images from \r\ncommercial satellites.”\r\n(spoke in Arabic)\r\nDespite that account, Mr. Amano has, for four \r\nconsecutive years, been repeating the same erroneous \r\nand misleading statements that he repeated this \r\nmorning.\r\nFourth, the commitment of the member States \r\nto the Statute of the IAEA would have required the \r\nUnited States of America to inform the Agency with \r\nthe information they had before they destroyed the \r\nbuilding, and not eight months after it was destroyed. \r\nThe same applies to Israel, which did not provide the \r\nAgency with any information. Not only did it not provide \r\nall the information — that is, if the information was \r\ncorrect — but it also launched a military aggression on \r\nsovereign Syrian territory by infiltrating the air space \r\nof a neighbouring country, namely, Turkey. The Agency \r\ndid not deal with the issue according to its mandate. It \r\ndid not follow the necessary procedures in accordance \r\n6/7 15-37314\r\nA/70/PV.56 17/11/2015\r\nwith its responsibilities and prerogatives with regard to \r\nIsrael’s violation of its international obligations.\r\nFifth, most of the conclusions of the Agency \r\nunder the current mandate of Director General Amano \r\nwith regard to the Dair Alzour site have been based \r\non the photos and analysis submitted by the Central \r\nIntelligence Agency. That raises a lot of questions as \r\nto the credibility of that information received by the \r\nIAEA and the nature of the supporting documents. The \r\nfact that a State that follows a hostile policy towards \r\nmy country’s interests presented the documents should \r\nalso be taken into account, as should the precedents on \r\nthe issue relating to the catastrophic Iraqi dossier. That \r\nfile is misleading and led to the invasion of Iraq, the \r\ndestruction of its infrastructure and the promotion of \r\nterrorism. The result came years later, in 2008, when \r\nthe report of the United Nations Special Commission \r\nestablished pursuant to Security Council resolution \r\n687 (1991 (UNSCOM) was placed in a box marked \r\n“Confidential”, not to be opened for 60 years. Why \r\nis that? Because the report concluded that UNSCOM, \r\nwhich was looking for weapons of mass destruction in \r\nIraq, could not find any.\r\nSixth, the recent report of the Director General \r\nincludes inconclusive conclusions based on information \r\nthat lacked credibility and comprehensiveness, and \r\nwhich contradicted the assessments of his predecessor, \r\nMr. ElBaradei. That also raises a lot of questions that \r\nrequire justification and clarification.\r\nSeventh, it is obvious that there is an intermingling \r\nbetween the legal commitments of member States to the \r\nsafeguard agreements and the voluntary procedures for \r\naccession to the additional protocol, which is not based \r\non any legal foundation and which seeks to impose \r\nfurther political pressure on my country.\r\nEighth, we have a question for the countries that \r\nhave provided a cover-up for Israeli nuclear weapons, \r\nas well as for the Director General of the IAEA and for \r\nthe Agency itself. What have they done to implement \r\nSecurity Council resolution 487 (1981), which has \r\nbeen on record for 30 years? Allow me to quote from \r\nparagraph 5 of that resolution, in which the Security \r\nCouncil called for\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n “Israel urgently to place its nuclear facilities under \r\nthe safeguards of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency”.\r\n (spoke in Arabic)\r\nNinth, an important report on armament and \r\ndisarmament and international security, which was \r\nissued by the Stockholm International Peace Research \r\nInstitute, has devoted an entire chapter to what it calls \r\nIsraeli nuclear “powers” — not “power”. I call on the \r\nDirector General of the IAEA to read that chapter in \r\norder to draw on the lessons learned and to immediately \r\nand conclusively deal with Israeli nuclear weapons, \r\nwhich threaten the lives of the peoples and States of \r\nthe region, in implementation of the resolutions of the \r\nAgency, along with those of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on agenda item 87.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on \r\ndraft resolution A/70/L.8, entitled “Report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency”.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Botnaru (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed on the draft \r\ndocument, the following countries have become \r\nsponsors of A/70/L.8: Argentina, Australia, Belgium, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, \r\nCroatia, Cyprus, Denmark, Finland, Georgia, Germany, \r\nHungary, Iceland, Indonesia, Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, \r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, \r\nMalta, Monaco, Montenegro, the Netherlands, Norway, \r\nthe Philippines, Poland, Republic of Korea, Republic of \r\nMoldova, Romania, San Marino, Singapore, Slovenia, \r\nSpain, Sweden, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, the United \r\nArab Emirates, the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland and the United States of America.\r\nThe Acting President: A recorded vote has been \r\nrequested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Argentina, Australia, Austria, \r\nBahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Bhutan, Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, Brazil, Brunei Darussalam, Bulgaria, \r\nCambodia, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa \r\nRica, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, \r\nDominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, Estonia, \r\nFinland, France, Georgia, Germany, Greece, \r\n15-37314 7/7\r\n17/11/2015 A/70/PV.56\r\nGuatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, \r\nIndonesia, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, \r\nIsrael, Italy, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, \r\nKuwait, Latvia, Lebanon, Liberia, Liechtenstein, \r\nLithuania, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Mexico, \r\nMonaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, \r\nMyanmar, Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, \r\nNorway, Oman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Peru, \r\nPhilippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Republic of \r\nKorea, Republic of Moldova, Romania, Rwanda, \r\nSan Marino, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Singapore, \r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sri Lanka, \r\nSweden, Switzerland, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey, \r\nUkraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, United \r\nStates of America, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Viet Nam\r\nAbstaining:\r\nBolivia (Plurinational State of), Chad, Cuba, \r\nNicaragua, Russian Federation, Sudan, Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic, United Republic of Tanzania, Venezuela \r\n(Bolivarian Republic of), Zimbabwe\r\nDraft resolution A/70/L.8 was adopted by 99 votes \r\nto none, with 10 abstentions (resolution 70/10).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegation of Malta informed \r\nthe Secretariat that it had intened to vote in favour.]\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor \r\nto speakers in explanation of vote, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike once again to express my deep condolences to the \r\npeoples, families and Governments that were targeted \r\nby the heinous terrorist attacks in France and the \r\nprevious terrorist attacks in Egypt, Lebanon and Iraq.\r\nIn recent years, my country has been part of \r\nthe consensus on the resolution on the report of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency. We had \r\nhoped that today’s resolution would avoid making \r\nany indirect reference to political matters that should \r\nnot be addressed here but that properly belong in the \r\nframework of bilateral interactions, especially between \r\ntwo countries with deep historical relations. I would like \r\nto note that the two countries concerned have friendly \r\nrelations with my country. My delegation will continue \r\nto support all of the paragraphs of the resolution. \r\nTherefore, in accordance with our explanation of vote, \r\nour delegation decided to abstain in the voting on the \r\nresolution.\r\nMr. Zdorov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): Belarus \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 70/10, because it supports \r\nthe activities of the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency and its annual report on the substance.\r\nAt the same time, we wish to express our concern \r\nabout the fact that we were unable to reach consensus \r\non the adoption of the resolution, which we could have \r\ndone if we had taken into account the specific positions \r\nof States on issues important to them. We hope that, \r\nin the future, we will be able to find a format that \r\nwill allow us to avoid such a situation and to focus on \r\ndiscussion of the mandated issues of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency.\r\nMrs. Del Sol Dominguez (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Allow me to why my delegation abstained \r\nin the voting on resolution 70/10, on the report of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency for 2014. Cuba \r\nabstained because my country laments the fact that \r\nnot all possible efforts were exhausted in all possible \r\nforums to accommodate the legitimate concerns of \r\nall delegations and to preserve the traditional and \r\nimportant consensus on the resolution.\r\nMr. Vallejos (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation abstained in the voting. We acknowledge, \r\nhowever, the importance of the work of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency and its valuable cooperation \r\nwith our countries. Nevertheless, we profoundly regret \r\nthat we were not able to adopt resolution 70/10 by \r\nconsensus and that it was not possible to accommodate \r\nall delegations by taking their legitimate concerns into \r\naccount. We hope that the debate on this issue will \r\ncontinue so that we can find a solution and arrive at \r\nthe consensus we need so badly on this as well as other \r\nimportant resolutions.\r\nOur delegation appreciates the work of the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency, and we will \r\ncontinue to cooperate with the Agency.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of General Assembly to conclude its consideration \r\nof agenda item 87?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.55 p.m.\r\n"
