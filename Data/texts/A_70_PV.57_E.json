With \r\n60 million people forcibly displaced worldwide due \r\nto simultaneous and large-scale humanitarian crises, \r\nthe General Assembly has assigned Mr. Grandi the \r\nenormous task of promoting the voice of those that are \r\nusually the most vulnerable.

Many crises \r\nhave been going on for decades, including that of the \r\nPalestinian refugees. Mr. Guterres has mobilized the \r\nnecessary efforts to bring assistance to millions of \r\nthose who have been forced to leave their country. He \r\nconsistently saw to meeting the needs and mitigating \r\nthe suffering of these refugees.\r\nIn these extremely challenging circumstances, \r\nMr. Grandi is assuming his responsibilities. Mr. Grandi \r\nis well known in the Organization and in our States. \r\nWe have cooperated and collaborated with him when \r\nhe was the Head of the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\n(UNRWA), which is the largest United Nations entity \r\ndealing with refugees. His work as a Commissioner-\r\nGeneral of UNRWA and his other noble qualities put \r\nhim in an excellent position at a time when the f low \r\nof refugees is a global challenge. These refugees are \r\nliving in deplorable conditions, having been forced to \r\nleave their countries and risk their lives in order to have \r\na better life.\r\nThe Gulf Cooperation Council consists of States \r\nwhich are among the primary ones to bring assistance \r\nto refugees and support the United Nations in this area. \r\nWe will continue our cooperation and collaboration \r\nwith Mr. Grandi and the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees so that they can fulfil \r\ntheir noble mission.\r\n15-37308 3/6\r\n18/11/2015 A/70/PV.57\r\nThe President: May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to conclude its consideration of \r\nsub-item (f) of agenda item 113?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 114 (continued)\r\nAppointments to fill vacancies in subsidiary organs \r\nand other appointments\r\n(g) Appointment of the judges of the United Nations \r\nDispute Tribunal\r\nMemorandum by the Secretary-General (A/70/538)\r\nReport of the Internal Justice Council (A/70/190)\r\nThe President: As indicated in document A/70/538, \r\nthe terms of office of one full-time judge of the Dispute \r\nTribunal based in Nairobi, Judge Vinod Boolell; \r\none full-time judge of the Dispute Tribunal based in \r\nGeneva, Judge Thomas Laker; and one half-time judge \r\nof the Dispute Tribunal, Judge Coral Shaw, are due to \r\nexpire on 30 June 2016.\r\nIt is therefore necessary for the General Assembly \r\nduring its current session to appoint a full-time judge \r\nbased in Nairobi, a full-time judge based in Geneva and \r\na half-time judge to the Dispute Tribunal, to fill the \r\nresulting vacancies.
