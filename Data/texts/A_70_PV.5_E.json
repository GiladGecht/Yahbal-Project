The peoples whom the \r\nUnited Nations stand to represent want to see if we are \r\ncapable of transforming our world in order to overcome \r\npoverty and to ensure a decent life for all. The people \r\nwe each represent at home should be informed that all \r\ncountries and all stakeholders have worked together to \r\ndesign this truly universal agenda. The scope of current \r\nchallenges is too broad and our vision is too grand to be \r\nachieved by any one country acting alone. We will help \r\nto do that by working effectively together. In one way \r\nor another, we are all on board, and we all should bring \r\nthis ambitious plan into action. If left unattended, the \r\nchallenges will become progressively more difficult. \r\nThat is why we are here to give guidance on the way \r\nforward. The new agenda reflects evenly shared \r\nchallenges for policymaking and implementation. It \r\ngives us a common destination and the comprehensive \r\nmeans for achieving it.\r\nI am a biologist by training. But one does not need \r\nto be a biologist to be concerned about climate change, \r\nloss of biodiversity, air pollution and access to safe \r\ndrinking water. One does not need to be a lawyer or \r\na statesman to know that access to quality education, \r\nhealth care and social protection, good governance, \r\njustice and respect for human rights, will work for the \r\nbenefit of all.\r\nIt is a great collective achievement that the rule of \r\nlaw and good governance are highlighted and recognized \r\nas universal principles in the new development Agenda. \r\nFrom our experience with transition, Latvia has seen \r\nthat these principles are the backbone of social and \r\neconomic transformation and should be entrenched in \r\nthe national value systems in promoting zero tolerance \r\nfor corruption. If justice systems do not work, if public \r\nadministration is inefficient and lacks transparency, \r\nif a Government disregards human rights, the very \r\nfoundations of a peaceful and safe society are \r\nundermined.\r\nModern technology and e-governance offer a unique \r\nopportunity to build trust between policymakers and \r\ncivil society. In Latvia, citizens can propose initiatives \r\nto the Parliament through an online petition platform \r\nUnited Nations A/70/PV.5\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventieth session\r\n5th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 25 September 2015, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lykketoft . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Denmark)\r\n2/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nand, if a proposed initiative gathers enough signatures, \r\nthe idea can be enacted into law. \r\nInclusive political processes and responsiveness \r\nto public needs are woven into the fabric of just and \r\nstable societies, particularly with respect to women \r\nand girls, who represent half of the world’s population. \r\nThe new Agenda provides us all with an opportunity \r\nto end the persistent inequalities, discrimination and \r\nviolence that the world’s women and girls confront on \r\na daily basis. Gender equality and the empowerment of \r\nwomen and girls is not only a matter of social justice, \r\nit also contributes to economic growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn Latvia, we have seen how that works. Women \r\nbecome senior Government officials and reach top \r\npositions in business management. Latvia has the \r\nseventh-highest proportion of women in middle \r\nand senior management positions in the world. The \r\nempowerment of women in Latvia has occurred because \r\nthe Constitution, our education system and public \r\nopinion support this goal. When men and women have \r\nequal rights and equal opportunities, societies function \r\nbetter. Domestically, we support gender equality with \r\nthe awareness that doing so makes a stronger nation. \r\nLikewise, acknowledging gender equality as a universal \r\nvalue makes the United Nations stronger. With women \r\nand men having equal rights to participate and take \r\non leadership roles at all levels, the international \r\ncommunity will become stronger and more efficient.\r\nToday we come to terms with a simple truth: \r\npresent and future social, economic and environmental \r\nchallenges that our planet is facing are interlinked. We \r\nmust coordinate our efforts more fully in addressing \r\nthese challenges. While each country has the primary \r\nresponsibility for its own economic and social \r\ndevelopment, it should be underlined that the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals have been developed by all \r\ncountries and are applicable to everyone. Every country \r\nshould be held accountable for the implementation of \r\nthese crucial goals. Each one of us has a decisive role to \r\nplay in charting the course of history.\r\nWe are looking ahead to a time 15 years from now \r\nwhen we can proudly say that we have given people a \r\nreal chance to rise above the poverty line and that we \r\nhave done that on a global scale. \r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia for his statement. \r\nMr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of El Salvador. \r\nMr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\nPresident Sánchez Cerén (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFor the people of Salvador, today’s Summit, which \r\nwill define the fate of humankind, is taking place in a \r\nspecial year, the year of the beatification of our martyr \r\nArchbishop Óscar Arnulfo Romero y Galdámez. \r\nThe beatification of his universal voice will assist in \r\nfulfilling the objectives of this international meeting. \r\nMonsignor Romero worked and gave his life for the \r\nvery ideals of justice and human dignity that we are \r\nproposing today. The message of courage and peace of \r\nthe blessed Romero also guides us in this Summit and \r\ngive us momentum to build well-being and happiness \r\nin the world.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of El Salvador, I \r\nwould like to say that we are honoured to be part of this \r\nhistoric moment for humankind. Today we begin a new \r\nstage where we undertake not to leave anyone behind, \r\nby adopting an Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nof universal character (resolution 70/1). We build upon \r\nthe major efforts made to achieve the objectives of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), which \r\nallowed substantial progress to be made even though \r\nall goals were not met at the global level. \r\nIn El Salvador we made significant progress in \r\nachieving the MDGs, even though we faced enormous \r\nenvironmental and economic difficulties, droughts, \r\nearthquakes and tropical storms, such as  Tropical \r\nStorm 12E, which caused damage equivalent in value \r\nto 4 per cent of our gross domestic product in 2011. In \r\nspite of all that, El Salvador has made important strides \r\nin recent years on social issues and has achieved most of \r\nthe objectives set forth in the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. Since 2009, we have decided to make social \r\nissues the State’s main priority by implementing \r\npublic policies related to equitable socioeconomic \r\ninclusion, public safety and environmental protection. \r\nWhen my Government came to power, in 2014, we \r\nstrengthened the State’s ability to fulfil its social \r\nresponsibilities and improved the system for providing \r\nenvironmental protection and gradually recovering \r\ndamaged ecosystems. We strengthened the basis of a \r\n15-29155 3/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nsystem of universal social protection with an emphasis \r\non policies and strategies that favour vulnerable groups \r\nand improving infrastructure and basic services. \r\nWe are proud to tell the world that now in El Salvador \r\nall public school students receive educational materials, \r\nuniforms, shoes and food for free. We have achieved \r\nuniversality in the delivery to our people of quality \r\npublic health services with a human touch. In 2012, \r\nwe surpassed the goal of reducing the number of \r\nhouseholds living in extreme poverty. By 2013, \r\nprimary education covered 93 per cent of the applicable \r\npopulation, and with the commitment of thousands of \r\nyoung volunteers, we worked to eradicate illiteracy. \r\nEl Salvador exceeded the targets relating to reducing \r\nmaternal mortality, increasing households with access \r\nto safe drinking water and promoting gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women. We will continue to \r\nwork on the agreed development goals and the new \r\ngoals we have adopted today.\r\nHumankind is going through great transformations \r\nin all areas, and there is a growing consensus among \r\nnations that development must at all times make the \r\nhuman being the central focus and ultimate end of its \r\nobjectives. Based on the painful experiences of war \r\nand conflict that many countries, including ours, have \r\nsuffered, we must undertake with responsibility and \r\ncourage a commitment to life and peacebuilding.\r\nLife on the planet, with all its biological and cultural \r\ndiversity, continues to be in danger. Mother Nature is \r\ncalling us on the centuries of abuse to which we have \r\nsubjected her. This Summit represents an unprecedented \r\nopportunity, as the resolution we have adopted is the \r\nfirst-ever to have been drafted with contributions from \r\nevery country and involving the active participation \r\nof civil society. We are presented with an opportunity \r\nto decide together on a path for improving the lives \r\nof our peoples. We seize this opportunity. Experience \r\nhas taught us that, to achieve essential sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the international community should \r\naddress equality among countries and regions while \r\nrespecting sovereignty and the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibility, as well as countries’ \r\nvulnerabilities and particular problems.\r\nWe know that, for the fulfilment of the post-\r\n2015 Agenda and to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, it is essential to build a new \r\nmodel of international cooperation, expand South-\r\nSouth cooperation and change the current structure of \r\ndevelopment financing. It is necessary that the review \r\nof the system of financing for development be based \r\non a comprehensive and multifaceted vision in terms \r\nof achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. It \r\nis also imperative that developing countries be duly \r\nrepresented in the process of reviewing the structure \r\nof the financial system in order to increase their \r\nparticipation in defining and establishing international \r\nstandards and in decision-making.\r\nThe Government of El Salvador is implementing a \r\nfive-year development plan based on the spirit embodied \r\nin the 2000 Millennium Summit. To realize this plan, \r\nwe are relying on the valuable support and assistance of \r\nfriendly countries and strategic partners with which we \r\nare carrying out high-impact projects, such as the City \r\nof Women, FOMILENIO II, a clean-energy-generation \r\nprogramme, the City of Childhood and Adolescence, a \r\nprogramme entitled “A Boy, A Girl, A Computer”, and \r\nmuch more in the areas of  health, public safety, justice \r\nand social inclusion and in strengthening dialogue and \r\nnational understanding, which are key to deepening \r\ndemocracy.\r\nI welcome in particular the support that has \r\ncontributed to sustainable development in my country. \r\nWe hope that our partners will continue their invaluable \r\ncontribution to ensuring that we comply with the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. I am convinced \r\nthat only by uniting wills, capabilities and resources \r\ncan we achieve the objectives and targets set for the \r\nnext 15 years.\r\nTo conclude, I wish to emphasize that the \r\ncommitments that we assume today do not apply only to \r\nfuture generations. They are a necessity for the present \r\ngeneration as well. I invite the General Assembly to \r\nmake the transition from words to deeds with unity, \r\ncourage and hope, and without hesitation. That is what \r\nour peoples expect from us.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof El Salvador for his statement. \r\nMr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Togolese Republic. \r\nMr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé, President of the \r\nTogolese Republic, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nPresident Gnassingbé (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to commend the important step that the great \r\n4/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nUnited Nations family has made in taking on the \r\nglobal vision of post-2015 development as set out in \r\nresolution 70/1. Even if it has been modest and uneven, \r\nthe progress that the regions concerned have been able \r\nto accomplish to date opens for us the way to deal with \r\nthe new Sustainable Development Goals we set today \r\nwith renewed vitality.\r\nThe first factor for success in achieving the new \r\ngoals is the ownership that the people we represent at \r\nthis Summit take in them. If we are to fully realize our \r\nAgenda, we need to adapt the goals to our regional and \r\nnational contexts and to the diversity of our cultures. \r\nIn that context, I am pleased that His Holiness Pope \r\nFrancis was able to generously share with us this \r\nmorning (see A/70/PV.3) his just view of the moral, \r\nhuman and religious requirements that we must not \r\nlose sight of in our quest for sustainable and inclusive \r\ndevelopment. \r\nIn the same vein, we must pay close attention to \r\nthe urgent appeal launched in June 2015 by the Bishops \r\nof Africa and Madagascar. Through their appeal, \r\nthey expressed their conviction that the development \r\nthat our people earnestly aspire to cannot come at the \r\nexpense of their core values, including with respect \r\nto life and family. That is why the Bishops of Africa \r\nand Madagascar offer us a more integral vision of the \r\nhuman person that takes into account the rich cultural \r\nheritage of Africa and the moral values  to which it \r\nremains committed.\r\nWhatever the results of our individual countries \r\nin the implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs), the most important today is probably \r\nto know how to build on the sum of the experiences \r\nof each of us in order to project ourselves resolutely \r\ninto the future. In that context, I would like to express \r\nmy gratitude to the Organization for involving my \r\ncountry, Togo, in the process of preparing the post-\r\n2015 development agenda. We are particularly pleased \r\nto have been selected, together with Belize, as a pilot \r\ncountry for trying out the new planning approach for \r\nintegrating sustainable development. Through that \r\ninitiative, Togo was able to assist in the consideration \r\nof Agenda 2022. It also strengthened its national \r\nprogramme for capacity-building and modernization \r\nof the State for sustainable development. Togo’s \r\nexperience in this field has demonstrated once again \r\nthat development is based essentially on human factors. \r\nThat is why we have resolved to commit for the long \r\nterm to the capacity-building efforts of development \r\nactors at all levels.\r\nI would like to recall the extent to which our fates \r\nare now linked. The effectiveness of the national \r\ndevelopment effort also depends upon the international \r\ncontext. It depends upon our ability to achieve the \r\nsecurity prerequisites without which no sustainable \r\naction can be considered.\r\nWhen we consider how much maritime insecurity \r\nand the major environmental risks hanging over our \r\nmarine areas are costing our economies, there is only \r\none possible conclusion: the sea and oceans are at the \r\nheart of the issues of sustainable development. Based \r\non that observation, the African Union Commission \r\nand Togo have agreed to organize in 2016 the African \r\nUnion extraordinary summit on maritime security \r\nand safety and development in Africa. I therefore take \r\nthis opportunity today to call on the international \r\ncommunity to remain mobilized so that the Lomé \r\nconference that we are actively preparing will be a \r\nsuccess. I am deeply convinced that such success will \r\nenable us to take a qualitative leap forward in achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Togolese \r\nRepublic for his statement. \r\nMr. Faure Essozimna Gnassingbé, President of the \r\nTogolese Republic, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chile. \r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nPresident Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): Chile \r\nis pleased to sign onto this agreement, as it will allow \r\nus to work for a better present and future for all the \r\ncountries that make up the General Assembly. From \r\nnow on, we will have an Agenda that addresses the great \r\nchallenges of a reality that does not allow for further \r\ndelay. What we do or fail to do today will determine our \r\nfate in the coming decades. \r\nWe acknowledge the enormous value of the \r\nagreement reached because it is commensurate with \r\nthe demands of today’s world and was drafted with \r\nthe participation of civil society, which gives it greater \r\nstrength. This Agenda did not come out of nowhere, nor \r\nis it naive. We have the experience of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which allowed us to make our \r\n15-29155 5/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nefforts converge and achieve results with respect to \r\nshared goals. \r\nAmong the various achievements reached in Latin \r\nAmerica were the reduction of poverty by 20 percentage \r\npoints, better income distribution, diminution by half \r\nof the proportion of people suffering from hunger, \r\nguaranteed access for girls to primary, secondary and \r\nhigher education, and the cutting by two thirds of the \r\nnumber of deaths among children under 5 years. \r\nNow, with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), we have committed \r\nto an action plan to coordinate national, regional and \r\nglobal efforts. We know that, because of the magnitude \r\nand complexity of new challenges, the individual \r\nactions of countries will need to be accompanied by \r\nefforts to work together. We also know that each \r\ncountry can participate in the financing mechanisms \r\nthat are required, in accordance with its abilities and \r\nparticularities. \r\nThe point is that it is now time for action, so that \r\nour efforts are consistent with the 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. It is a commitment that in Chile \r\nwe are undertaking with reforms that are already under \r\nway. It is not an easy path, but we are working to ensure \r\nfully paid-for quality education, true gender parity, \r\ndevelopment that is harmonious with the environment, \r\nand balanced relationships between employer and \r\nworkers, so that ultimately there is a solid basis for \r\nsocial cohesion.\r\nBecause it is a matter of specific commitments, \r\neach country must focus its strengths on the urgent \r\nchange that our times require and that this framework \r\nof working together demands. We all have a duty to \r\nperform. Accordingly, Chile will continue to meet \r\nglobal challenges in Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nwhile promoting economic integration, security and \r\npeace and programmes in favour of South-South \r\ncooperation.\r\nWe should not forget that in our region there are \r\nstill about 71 million people who remain destitute and \r\nthat inequality continues to be the main problem to be \r\nsolved. More than 7.5 million of children under the age of \r\n5 still suffer from chronic malnutrition, and gender gaps \r\npersist in the workplace and in political participation. \r\nWe are committed, together with the United Nations \r\ncommunity, to meeting the obligation to move forward \r\ntogether in the fight against hunger, injustice, inequality \r\nand pollution of the land and oceans. As is required by \r\nthe Sustainable Development Agenda, we must look at \r\nthe present with the responsibility of one who comes \r\nto a decisive crossroads where the survival and the \r\ndevelopment of our peoples are at stake. \r\nToday we can take steps to build a more just world \r\nand deliver a better quality of life for millions of \r\ninhabitants of the world. But if we do not act resolutely \r\nor with the gravity that the situation requires, we will \r\nsurely not have the chance to do so tomorrow. That is \r\nthe extent of the challenge being faced by our nations \r\nand our leaders. It is the scale of the challenge that we \r\nare undertaking in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and which we must also face at the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Paris.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Chile for her statement.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the rostrum. \r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Malawi. \r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharik, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nPresident Mutharika: It is a pleasure for me and \r\nmy delegation to be part of this event, at which we have \r\nadopted the post-2015 development agenda (resolution \r\n70/1).\r\nMalawi welcomed the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) because they established the benchmark \r\nfor global development policy. At the national level, \r\nMalawi implemented the MDGs through a number \r\nof medium-term development strategies that we, as a \r\ncountry, developed. Those medium-term development \r\nstrategies mainstreamed the MDGs and ensured that \r\ntheir implementation was financed through the national \r\nbudget framework. Therefore, the mainstreaming \r\nof the MDGs into national strategies simplified \r\nimplementation of the goals because they formed part \r\nof our sector activities.\r\nI would now like to turn to the progress that Malawi \r\nhas made in achieving the MDGs. It has become clear \r\nthat Malawi has managed to achieve only four of the eight \r\nMDGs — namely, reducing child mortality; combating \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases; ensuring \r\nenvironmental sustainability; and developing global \r\npartnerships for development. Malawi has therefore \r\n6/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nnot been able to attain the gender-related MDGs, \r\nincluding eradicating extreme poverty and hunger; \r\nachieving universal primary education; promoting \r\ngender equality and the empowerment of women; and \r\nimproving maternal health. Therefore, as Malawi starts \r\nimplementing the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), there will be a need to seriously take a keen \r\ninterest in implementing the gender-related goals. That \r\nwill, inter alia, ensure that our women are empowered \r\nand that the girl child is assured of finishing her basic \r\neducation.\r\nWe learned a number of lessons during the \r\nimplementation of the MDGs, including the importance \r\nof localizing international commitments, the use of \r\n“smart” indicators in measuring progress, the value \r\nof the multi-stakeholder approach in implementing \r\ndevelopment frameworks, the need for resources in \r\nimplementing the MDGs, the role of interlinkages within \r\nthe MDGs, the impact of emerging natural disasters \r\non the attainment of MDGs, and the importance of \r\nsustaining progress once implementation has begun. \r\nMalawi was part and parcel of the intergovernmental \r\nconsultations that shaped the SDGs. My country was \r\nselected as one of 50 countries for initial consultations \r\ndone to provide information that formed the post-2015 \r\ndiscussions on “the future we want”. Malawi therefore \r\ndoes not have any problems with the SDGs negotiations \r\noutcome document, because it ref lects the wishes of \r\nMalawians. I therefore have no doubt that Malawi’s \r\nadopting the SDGs in their current form will serve the \r\ninterests of Malawians.\r\nMy country realizes that localizing international \r\ncommitments is a sure way of implementing international \r\ncommitments, because they are implemented as part \r\nof sector activities. In view of that, the localization \r\nof SDGs will be an important aspect of developing \r\nthe successor to the country’s development strategy. \r\nFinally, as we adopt the SDGs, let us not forget to learn \r\nthe lessons from the shortfalls in the implementation of \r\nthe MDGs, especially for us, the developing countries.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Malawi for his statement.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. David Arthur Granger, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Granger: The Cooperative Republic of \r\nGuyana is honoured to participate in this worldwide \r\nobservance of the seventieth anniversary of the founding \r\nof the United Nations. This event coincides, happily, \r\nwith the adoption of a worldwide, transformative \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1). These twin events provide the opportunity for \r\nus to reaffirm both our resolve to respect the founding \r\nprinciples of the United Nations and our commitment \r\nto the renewal of our promise to pursue development \r\nfor all.\r\nWe embark upon this new Agenda by building on \r\nthe achievements and experiences of many countries \r\nacross the globe, including my own, in implementing \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. We are conscious \r\nthat in doing so the imperatives of strong and effective \r\nmonitoring, the full integration of the economic, social \r\nand environmental dimensions and early and concrete \r\nactions to give effect to the global partnership for \r\ndevelopment will be given particular relevance.\r\nGuyana is conscious of the fact that achieving the \r\nsustainable development goals for all will require high \r\nlevels of political commitment. This Summit is only \r\na start. We must continue to work with one another \r\nas States in the international community and to work \r\ntogether with our own people within our countries. \r\nUnity of effort is essential to confront the difficult but \r\nnecessary choices that must be made to realize the goal \r\nof sustainable development. Vigilance will be required \r\nfrom us as leaders, and from all stakeholders.\r\nA reformed and revitalized United Nations \r\ndevelopment system and intergovernmental machinery, \r\nincluding the Economic and Social Council and the \r\nHigh-level Political Forum, will be needed to exercise \r\ncore functions in such a manner as to provide impetus, \r\nenable accountability and actualize course correction. \r\nThere must be policy integration to address competing \r\npriorities and demands. We count on the United Nations \r\nsystem for effective support and guidance in that regard.\r\nThe Cooperative Republic of Guyana is of the view \r\nthat the same spirit of understanding and cooperation \r\nthat attended the preparation of this Agenda should \r\nmark its implementation. Success will require nothing \r\nless. We have laid the basis for the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda. The means of implementation outlined \r\nin the Agenda, in conjunction with the provisions of \r\n15-29155 7/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda, will be critical to the \r\nrealization of the Sustainable Development Goals and \r\ntargets. We recognize that all sources of financing will \r\nbe required to contribute to the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda. All countries, developed and developing, \r\nwill be required to play positive roles in accordance with \r\ntheir diverse circumstances, situations and resources.\r\nProgress in implementing the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda can provide a strong impetus to efforts to \r\nimplement the 2030 Agenda. That is especially pertinent \r\nto such service deliverables as implementing a new global \r\nsocial compact for the delivery of social protection and \r\nessential public services for all, increasing international \r\ncooperation in tax matters, ensuring debt sustainability, \r\nintensifying efforts to end hunger and malnutrition, \r\nbridging critical infrastructure gaps, operationalizing \r\nthe technology facilitation mechanism, and using the \r\nEconomic and Social Council forum for the follow-up \r\nto the third International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment.\r\nGuyana recognizes the links between peace, \r\nsecurity and the rule of law and the successful \r\nimplementation of this Agenda. Guyana calls on all \r\nnations to eschew recourse to the threat or use of force \r\nin the resolution of controversies. Guyana urges that \r\nfriendship and understanding should underpin relations \r\nbetween States in consonance with the principles of \r\ninternational law and in a renewed spirit of global \r\nsolidarity and partnership.\r\nAt the national level, Guyana is richer for the many \r\nlessons of our collective development experience. Not \r\nthe least has been our long embrace of the primacy of the \r\npursuit of a path of sustainable development, including \r\nthe effective integration of its three dimensions at all \r\nlevels. Guyana will work tirelessly, in accordance with \r\nour national plans and aspirations, to build a modern, \r\npeaceful and prosperous nation in which all citizens \r\nshare equally in the benefits of development.\r\nGuyana’s policy is to ensure inclusive and equitable \r\nquality education and to promote opportunities for all. \r\nEducation, which is Sustainable Development Goal 4, \r\nis the mother of the other goals. It is the gateway to \r\nreducing inequality. It is the gateway to empowering \r\nall women and girls, which is Goal 5. It will boost \r\nnational efforts in the fight against poverty — Goal 1. \r\nIts achievement is necessary to end hunger. Over the \r\nnext five years, Guyana will have as one of its foremost \r\npriorities of national development the provision of \r\ninclusive and equitable quality education and lifelong \r\nlearning opportunities for all.\r\nIt lies within our collective will to address the \r\ndefining challenges of our time successfully. The \r\nchallenges include eliminating trafficking in persons; \r\neradicating poverty; promoting more inclusive, just and \r\npeaceful societies; and combating climate change. We \r\nmust harness a spirit of understanding and cooperation \r\nto ensure the successful implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development within the \r\nnext 15 years. The Cooperative Republic of Guyana \r\ndeclares today its full support for the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. We commit to working \r\nuntiringly for its full realization. We are determined \r\nto achieve all the Sustainable Development Goals and \r\ntheir targets — they represent the finest aspirations of \r\nhumankind. The world we want for future generations \r\nis within our grasp. In this great global family, the \r\nUnited Nations, no woman, no child, no one should be \r\nleft behind.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guyana for his statement.\r\nMr. David Arthur Granger, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Uhuru Kenyatta, \r\nPresident and Commander-in-Chief of the Defence \r\nForces of the Republic of Kenya.\r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and Commander -\r\n-in -Chief of the Defence Forces of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Kenyatta: It is a great honour and \r\npleasure to join the General Assembly on this historic \r\nday as we convene to adopt a new development \r\nAgenda. Let me commend the Member States and \r\nevery stakeholder, all of whom patiently engaged in \r\nthe negotiations, whose culmination is a visionary, \r\ntransformative and ambitious blueprint. Let me also \r\nthank the Assembly for the confidence shown in Kenya \r\nby bestowing on my country the honour of co-chairing \r\nthe intergovernmental process that led to this \r\noutcome. I believe that the adoption of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (resolution 70/1) will galvanize \r\nglobal action towards ending poverty in all its forms.\r\nFifteen years ago, at the Millennium Summit, we \r\nadopted the Millennium Declaration (resolution 55/2). \r\nThrough that Declaration, we adopted the Millennium \r\n8/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nDevelopment Goals (MDGs), through which we \r\nundertook to exert all efforts to reduce extreme poverty \r\nby the year 2015. Since then, we have made significant \r\nprogress in poverty reduction. Many of the MDGs have \r\nbeen achieved. Between 1990 and 2002, for example, \r\noverall incomes rose, and there was a sharp decline \r\nin the number of people living in extreme poverty, \r\nas well as in child mortality rates. Life expectancy \r\nrose from age 63 to nearly 65. An additional 8 per \r\ncent of the developing world’s people received access \r\nto water, while an additional 15 per cent acquired \r\naccess to improved sanitation services. Similarly, over \r\n100 million people have been uplifted from slums.\r\nWe know that today more girls than ever before are \r\ngoing to school at all levels. More women are joining \r\nthe ranks of formal employment. I also note that the \r\nspread of HIV/AIDS is being reversed: new infections \r\nfell by 40 per cent between the years 2000 and 2013. \r\nImportant milestones have also been reached in the fight \r\nagainst malaria and tuberculosis. Similarly, efforts to \r\nmanage the global environment have been accelerated, \r\nwith significant reductions reported in ozone-depleting \r\nsubstances.\r\nHowever, we must acknowledge that progress has \r\nbeen uneven across the world and across the Goals. \r\nThere remain huge disparities between and within \r\ncountries. Rural poverty remains unacceptably high \r\nwithin countries, while urban poverty is extensive \r\nand underreported via traditional indicators. In some \r\nparts of sub-Saharan Africa, child and maternal \r\nmortality are rising. Even where progress has taken \r\nplace, consumption patterns and their impact on the \r\nenvironment are unsustainable. The world continues \r\nto be under threat from the negative impacts of global \r\nwarming and climate change. Millions of people \r\nworldwide still lack access to quality education and \r\nhealth care.\r\nIn Kenya, we have made tremendous progress over \r\nthe past decade. For instance, since the adoption of free \r\nuniversal primary education in the year 2003, gross \r\nenrolment rates have risen from 88 per cent to 96 per \r\ncent. Even more significantly, we have now achieved \r\ngender parity in the primary school cycle, while the \r\ntransition from primary to secondary and tertiary levels \r\nhave greatly improved.\r\nMy Government has also introduced several \r\nmeasures to promote gender mainstreaming. For \r\nexample, by legislation and Government policy, one \r\nthird of all public appointments and legislative positions \r\nare reserved for women. The Government has also \r\nestablished the Women Enterprise Fund and the Uwezo \r\nFund to advance the cause of women’s entrepreneurship. \r\nMy country has also reserved at least 30 per cent of \r\nall positions in the public sector for women, youth and \r\npeople living with disabilities. We continue to promote \r\nappropriate skills to increase employment for women \r\nand youths.\r\nIn the health sector, we have eliminated user charges \r\nfor maternity services in our public health facilities. \r\nMy Government is also providing free antiretroviral \r\ndrugs and voluntary counselling and testing services, \r\nall part of a sustained national campaign against \r\nsexually transmitted diseases. That mix of preventive \r\nand curative measures has ensured important gains \r\nin the health of our nation. The rate of immunization \r\nfor children under 1 year old, for instance, has risen to \r\n85 per cent, while HIV/AIDS infections have fallen to \r\n6 per cent.\r\nThe lessons learned from the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals show that much can \r\nbe achieved when the world finds focus around shared \r\ncommon goals. The new Agenda we have adopted today \r\nis an ambitious plan for collective action to transform \r\nthe fate of humankind by lifting all people out of \r\npoverty while remaining in harmony with our planet.\r\nMany of the Goals in the post-2015 development \r\nAgenda strongly resonate with Kenya’s development \r\naspirations as articulated in our development blueprint, \r\nwhich we call Vision 2030. We are convinced that, \r\nunder this Agenda, a world free from poverty and \r\nhunger is achievable within the next 15 years. We \r\nalso believe that a world in which development is in \r\nharmony with nature is also possible. The vision on the \r\nenvironment is therefore correctly rooted in the Agenda \r\nas a prerequisite for moving our societies towards \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe goals of this Agenda are extremely ambitious. \r\nThey therefore require an equally ambitious means \r\nof implementation. Without adequate resources from \r\ndiverse places and institutions, the Agenda we have \r\nadopted today might never be realized. Of course, \r\nwe recognize that the primary responsibility for \r\ndevelopment in our countries shall first and foremost \r\nlie with us. However, resources from our development \r\npartners will also be critical. I urge them to substantially \r\nincrease the resources that are available to developing \r\ncountries as official development assistance. In \r\naddition, we should all address issues that have in the \r\n15-29155 9/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\npast impeded developing countries from channelling \r\nadequate resources to the needs of the poor. I believe \r\nthat addressing debt sustainability and trade reforms \r\nwill go a long away towards addressing these needs. \r\nAfter all, trade is at least as good a means of ending \r\npoverty as aid.\r\nAs I conclude my statement, I reiterate once again \r\nthat the success of today’s Agenda in the years ahead \r\nwill require new ideas and courage. The effective \r\nmobilization of resources in the context of a global \r\npartnership will be critical in that effort. I am therefore \r\nhappy to announce that, to that end, Kenya will host \r\nthe second high-level meeting of the Global Partnership \r\nfor Effective Development Cooperation in November \r\n2016. I am happy to welcome all Member States to that \r\nimportant meeting. I believe it will provide us with an \r\nimportant forum to exchange ideas on how to move this \r\nAgenda forward. Finally, I join the global community \r\nin adopting this important Agenda. \r\nThe President: I thank the President and \r\nCommander -in -Chief of the Defence Forces of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya for his statement.\r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, President and Commander-\r\nin Chief of the Defence Forces of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted from rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Liberia.\r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Johnson-Sirleaf: Our new global \r\ndevelopment Agenda (resolution 70/1) — entitled \r\n“Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development” — is the result of the most \r\nconsultative process in history. Consultations and \r\nnegotiations spanned many years, starting with the 2010 \r\nSummit to adopt the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs) and proceeding to the 2012 Rio+20 United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich crafted a vision of the future we want. Our \r\nSustainable Development Goals and targets were \r\nformulated following protracted negotiations in 2013 \r\nand 2014. This year’s negotiations culminated in the \r\nconsensus document we adopted this morning. \r\nI commend Member States, regional groupings, \r\ncivil society organizations, private-sector actors and \r\nall stakeholders who worked tirelessly to create this \r\nnew framework. Given the complex nature of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, we offer deserving \r\ncommendation to the outgoing President of the General \r\nAssembly and to the co-facilitators, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Kenya and Ireland, who skilfully \r\nnavigated the process. We pay tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his leadership in guiding \r\nthe process, and we appreciate the effective work of \r\nhis Special Adviser. In 2013, I was honoured to serve, \r\nalong with Prime Minister David Cameron of the United \r\nKingdom and President Susilu Bambang Yudhoyono of \r\nIndonesia, as one of the three co-Chairs of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s High-Level Panel of Eminent Persons on \r\nthe Post-2015 Agenda. We worked with 27 panellists \r\nfrom around the world to set the vision and policy \r\nframework for a bold, strategic and universal agenda. \r\nThe membership of the Panel included representatives \r\nfrom every segment of society, including Governments, \r\nacademia, civil society organizations and the private \r\nsector.\r\nFifteen years ago, the MDGs were launched with \r\na vision to build a better world. At the Millennium \r\nSummit in September 2000, we set time-bound targets \r\nto address critical challenges. The world has made \r\nsignificant progress in achieving many of those targets. \r\nAverage overall incomes have increased, extreme \r\npoverty has declined, child mortality rates have fallen, \r\nlife expectancy has risen and more people in the \r\ndeveloping world have access to improved sanitation \r\nservices.\r\nBut progress has been far from uniform across the \r\nworld and across the Goals. Huge gaps remain across \r\nand within countries. Poverty remains the greatest \r\nchallenge, especially in rural areas. Urban poverty \r\nis also extensive and underreported by traditional \r\nindicators. We are grateful that the new development \r\nAgenda calls our attention to the unfinished business of \r\nthe MDGs while broadening the vision to incorporate \r\nnew challenges. That is why every segment of the \r\nglobal community contributed to making this Agenda \r\na reality.\r\nCo-Chair Museveni took the Chair.\r\nIn Africa in 2013, the African Union established \r\na high-level committee on the post-2015 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which I was honoured to chair. \r\nThe committee launched a consultative process that \r\nculminated in the adoption of a common African \r\nposition that reflected the priorities of our continent. \r\nI am very pleased to acknowledge today that our \r\npriorities are substantially integrated into both the post-\r\n10/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\n2015 Development Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda. Together those documents demand a universal \r\ncommitment to the shared vision of eradicating poverty \r\nand hunger, safeguarding our planet and opening the \r\ndoor to prosperity for the benefit of people everywhere. \r\nPeaceful societies and revitalized global partnerships \r\nare essential requirements for the achievement of those \r\naspirations.\r\nWe must pursue single-mindedly the achievement \r\nof the Goals enshrined in this Agenda. It can be done. \r\nOur world has never been richer, more integrated or \r\nbetter educated than now. Therefore, with the resources \r\nat our disposal and the creative power of all, we can \r\nlift those at the margins of progress — women and \r\nyouth — and achieve success. Dignity for all, peaceful \r\nsocieties all around the globe and providing every \r\nhuman being with the means to live to his or her full \r\npotential are well within our means. We cannot afford \r\nto fail. And we must truly leave no one behind.\r\nThe Addis Ababa Action Agenda provides the \r\ntoolkit for countries, especially poor and post-\r\nconflict countries, to galvanize the resources needed \r\nto implement the new Agenda. It challenges all of \r\nus to take concrete measures that will transform our \r\ncommitments into practical solutions that improve the \r\nlives of our people. Based on that common framework, \r\nwith sustainability at its core, we will move forward in \r\ncrafting national development policies and strategies, \r\nbut with the recognition that, while the goals and \r\ntargets are universal in nature, every country will have \r\nto develop its own priorities towards achieving the \r\nglobal ambition of a new world of peace and prosperity \r\nin a safe planet.\r\nGiven its scope and level of ambition, the post-\r\n2015 development Agenda will require more effective, \r\nstrengthened and improved modes of development \r\ncooperation to support its implementation. We call for \r\na renewed and revitalized global partnership among \r\nnations, underpinned by North-South, South-South \r\nand triangular cooperation, with specific attention on \r\nfair trade, taxation and technology, while combating \r\nillicit financial f lows and terrorism. At the core \r\nof our actions, we must affirm our commitment to \r\ntransparency, accountability and mutual respect. Those \r\nare the fundamentals of genuine partnerships.\r\nThe successful implementation of the 2030 \r\nDevelopment Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nwill depend largely upon the concrete measures taken \r\nat the subnational, national, regional and global levels. \r\nWe must set in motion national processes that will \r\nguide our efforts to domesticate and integrate the new \r\nAgenda into local content that will engender national \r\nownership in the implementation process. A strong \r\nfollow-up and review mechanism will enhance effective \r\nimplementation and ensure that citizens have the means \r\nto assess progress. We must also embark upon a data \r\nrevolution geared towards developing capacities for \r\ndevelopment planning, monitoring and evaluation.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nToday we made history by adopting the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development to replace the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. In so doing, we have \r\nassumed the challenge and responsibility to deliver to \r\nfuture generations, in the next 15 years, a world free \r\nof poverty and hunger and a more secure planet for \r\neveryone. This must be our legacy.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Liberia for her statement.\r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, President of the \r\nRepublic of Liberia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Excellency Mr. Anote Tong, \r\nPresident, Head of Government and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Kiribati.\r\nMr. Anote Tong, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nKiribati, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Tong: It is an honour and a privilege \r\nfor me to address this historic Summit on behalf of \r\nthe Government and the people of Kiribati. Let me \r\ngreet the Assembly formally: “Na bane ni mauri”. \r\nToday indeed marks a truly momentous occasion as \r\nwe, representatives of our peoples from all corners \r\nof the globe, gather to adopt an ambitious Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) for our \r\nrespective peoples for the next 15 years.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to commend the sterling \r\nleadership and commitment of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon in steering our family of nations forward \r\nand in pushing our ambition to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all. I also wish to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate the co-Chairs on their appointment to \r\nchair this historic Summit. And I commend the new \r\nPresident of the General Assembly on his assumption \r\nof the presidency of the Assembly at its seventieth \r\n15-29155 11/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nsession. I also would like to commend his predecessor, \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session, His Excellency Mr. Sam Kutesa, for \r\nhis leadership in guiding the massive task of shaping \r\nthe Agenda before us today. I would like to especially \r\ncommend the co-facilitators, Ambassador Kamau and \r\nAmbassador Donoghue, for their outstanding leadership \r\nin chairing the lengthy work of the Open Working \r\nGroup on intergovernmental negotiations, indeed a \r\nmassive, inclusive and consultative process that lasted \r\nmore than two years. Allow me to congratulate them on \r\na job well done.\r\nThis is truly a major multilateral achievement as \r\nwe celebrate the seventieth year of the United Nations. \r\nAs we celebrate, we should also reflect and ensure \r\nthat this premier global body remains responsive to \r\nthe needs of the most fragile and vulnerable of people \r\nin its membership. That is the real litmus test for the \r\nOrganization’s relevance and effectiveness. The new \r\nAgenda we have adopted at this Summit presents an \r\nagenda of hope for humankind, one underpinned by the \r\noverall goal of eliminating poverty and the key theme \r\nof leaving no one behind — an agenda that we hope can \r\nensure that no one is left behind.\r\nSome critics were already delivering a verdict \r\neven before the adoption of this new Agenda, saying \r\nthat there were just too many goals and targets. There \r\nwill always be critics, and who knows that better than \r\nwe do as politicians. But the truth of the matter is that \r\nthese Goals reflect the realities and the multitude of \r\nchallenges facing humankind across the globe today. \r\nIf we were to ask the question, “What are the root \r\ncauses of the violent conflicts around the globe that are \r\ncausing the senseless loss of tens of thousands of lives, \r\nthe massive movement of refugees now experienced \r\nin Europe, the emergence of fundamentalist terrorist \r\ngroups around the world, and the change in our climate \r\nsystem?”, many of the answers to those questions could \r\nbe found in the lack of attention to the Goals in front \r\nof us in this new Agenda. These Goals are not new. \r\nMost, if not all, are in our national development plans \r\nand strategies. What is new is the global call for the \r\ninternational community and national Governments \r\nto do things differently to effect the transformational \r\nchanges necessary to achieve what we politicians \r\npromise our people every time before elections. That is \r\ncrucial in an increasingly interdependent world where \r\nthe decisions made and actions done in one country will \r\nhave rippling effects elsewhere in other countries. That \r\nis why we come to the Assembly every year to share \r\nour national agendas so that we can shape the global \r\nagenda in a positive way as an agenda that would be \r\nmeaningful to all.\r\nLet me therefore focus on the one key global goal \r\nfor us in this Agenda: Goal 13, the need to take urgent \r\naction to combat the effects of climate change, which is \r\nparticularly important for the most vulnerable countries \r\nsuch as mine, which are now already experiencing the \r\nimpact of climate change. I do so because it poses an \r\nexistential challenge for my people, and this goal is one \r\nthat, if not given urgent attention now, has the potential \r\nto negate all efforts towards sustainable development, \r\nbut it is also one that will challenge the survival of \r\ngenerations to come.\r\nOver the years, I have come here to this forum \r\nto explain the vulnerability of our people. I do not \r\nwant to repeat what I have said year after year. This \r\nis the last time I want to do it. But the point I want \r\nto share is that things are happening. Storm patterns \r\nare changing; weather patterns are changing. We are \r\nalready experiencing extreme storm events that we \r\nnever experienced in the past.\r\nThe real test of our commitment to the new Agenda \r\nwill be the United Nations Climate Change Conference. \r\nThe new sustainable development agenda will mean \r\nnothing if the Paris summit in December does not come \r\nup, not with an ambitious, but with what I believe to \r\nbe a meaningful, legally binding agreement that can \r\naddress the urgent challenge for those of us on the front \r\nlines of the climate change challenge. We must step \r\nup our national and collective efforts to meaningfully \r\nreduce global greenhouse gas emissions. We must urge \r\nmajor greenhouse gas emitters to do their part.\r\nWe must also call with urgency on our development \r\npartners and on philanthropy from the private sector to \r\nassist those on the front line of the climate calamity to \r\ndeal with the impacts of climate change and sea-level \r\nrise now being experienced in our countries to assist in \r\nour efforts to prepare our people for a very uncertain \r\nfuture. Let us call on those with the ability to assist and \r\nwho have a contribution to make to join in the global \r\ndialogue — but, more important, in the call for urgent \r\naction to address this major challenge.\r\nBusiness as usual can no longer be considered to \r\nbe a path forward. Let us not limit ourselves to working \r\nwithin the shackles and boundaries of our comfort \r\nzones. The challenge of climate change continues to \r\ndemand that we think outside the bounds of conventional \r\n12/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nthinking, because these are extraordinary challenges \r\nthat call for extraordinary and unconventional \r\nsolutions. We need to take bold steps, even if we are \r\nnot sure they are the right ones. If necessary, we can \r\nimprovise on the way. But whatever we do, we cannot \r\nafford to be paralysed into inaction simply because of \r\nthe apparent impossibility of the challenge confronting \r\nus. Time is running out, and the current alternatives are \r\nnot acceptable.\r\nIt is most gratifying to note that an emerging \r\nglimmer of hope exists — that a shift in the wind in the \r\ndialogue on climate change has occurred. This morning \r\nwe heard His Holiness Pope Francis speak on climate \r\nchange. We welcome the messages and expressions of \r\ncommitment from a growing number of quarters, from \r\nmore capitals around the globe and from civil society, \r\nwhich recognize that climate change poses a major \r\nchallenge and requires urgent action. We from the \r\nfront-line nations welcome that most gratifying shift \r\nas a very positive development in the right direction. \r\nAt last, the international community has heard our \r\nmessages and our shared stories on the plight of our \r\npeoples.\r\nBut hearing our story and recognizing that climate \r\nchange is a major challenge is not enough. We need to \r\nact on the problem with urgency. We may be on the front \r\nline now, but so will the millions of others in the times \r\nahead. As we endorse our new Sustainable Development \r\nAgenda and celebrate the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nUnited Nations family, we must believe that no Member \r\nnation should have to plan on its own for a time when \r\nits people will no longer have a country and a place that \r\nthey can call home. Merely saying and acknowledging \r\nthat climate change is a challenge simply will not do. \r\nWhat is important is our response to the problem as a \r\nglobal community of moral human beings. The real test \r\nof the effectiveness and relevance of the new Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and of the United Nations \r\nfamily as we celebrate its seventieth anniversary is in \r\nensuring that no one is left behind. Yet my people and \r\nthose on the front line of climate change face the real \r\npossibility of being left behind.\r\nI therefore call on this Summit and on the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session to lend their support \r\nto the voice of the most vulnerable. We call on the \r\ninternational community to establish an ambitious and \r\nmeaningful, legally binding agreement that can begin \r\nto heal our one shared home and planet. I also call on \r\nthis Summit to join our voice so as to ensure that the \r\nagreement in Paris will include a special mechanism \r\nto fast-track urgent action for those countries on the \r\nfront line of climate change that need such action now. \r\nIt is no longer about who is to blame or what caused the \r\nproblem, it is about urgently working together, within \r\nour capabilities, as good global citizens, to urgently \r\naddress the major challenge to all peoples and to our \r\none and only home: our planet Earth.\r\nLet me conclude by sharing with the Assembly \r\nour traditional Kiribati blessings of “Te mauri, te raoi \r\nao te tabomoa”, which means “May health, peace and \r\nprosperity be with us all”.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nKiribati for his statement.\r\nMr. Anote Tong, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of \r\nKiribati, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nPanama.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Varela Rodríguez (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, I have come to affirm our strong \r\ncommitment to the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which we have adopted at this Summit \r\n(resolution 70/1). It is dedicated to uniting our efforts \r\nand aligning our national priorities with global ones \r\nin order to ensure domestic tranquillity, welfare and \r\nprosperity for present and future generations.\r\nAbove and beyond any differences that may arise \r\nbetween countries, Governments must seek the same \r\ncriteria and work together to tackle the problems \r\nfacing us, both within and beyond our borders. That \r\nwas the spirit of the seventh Summit of the Americas, \r\nheld in April this year in Panama, where the slogan \r\nwas “Prosperity with equity”. The 35 countries of the \r\ncontinent sent a clear message that we stand ready to \r\nwork together for a better region and a better world. \r\nA strong global alliance among countries, bringing \r\ntogether Governments, civil society and citizens, \r\nis the only way to transform the lives of millions of \r\npeople who still face social exclusion. We believe in \r\nthat vision, and in Panama we have set the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) as the official guidelines \r\n15-29155 13/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nfor our Government, while ensuring the resources for \r\nits effective implementation.\r\nOur Government plan is in line with the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. It is backed \r\nup by a strategic plan for public investment that will \r\nenable us to move steadily towards achieving the 17 \r\nGoals of the new Agenda. In order to eradicate poverty, \r\nwe have strengthened and expanded the coverage of \r\nthe programmes of our social protection system, which \r\ncurrently serves 20 per cent of the population. Access \r\nto safe drinking water and basic sanitation is a priority. \r\nThat is why our Administration has allocated about \r\n30 per cent of total public investment for 2015-2019 to \r\nachieving that objective.\r\nIn drawing up the Goals we have been thinking \r\nof future generations. For them, education is the key. \r\nIn our country we are allocating the resources needed \r\nfor full secondary-school coverage. That will benefit \r\nyoung people, in particular young people at social risk \r\nand school dropouts, so that they can return to the \r\neducational system and the job market. Our economy is \r\nstill growing at approximately 6 per cent per year, and \r\nwe are now generating more better-paying jobs. And \r\nwe are very close to becoming the first country in the \r\nregion to be declared free of child labour.\r\nThe efficient use of State resources will be key \r\nto meeting the Sustainable Development Goals. That \r\nis why in our country we have just held a national \r\ndialogue for the effective coordination of the public \r\nhealth system, which will make it more effective and \r\nwill improve health benefits. New technologies and \r\ndatabases must be used constructively. They can be \r\nused to measure progress in achieving the Goals. In \r\nPanama we decided to use them in a national census \r\non preventive health to determine the state of health of \r\nour people.\r\nWe also want to replace the shantytowns in our \r\ncountry. We want to make sure that all our citizens have \r\ndecent housing. That is a goal that we hope to achieve \r\nby 2020, jointly with the private sector, via a project \r\ncalled “Roofs of Hope”.\r\nWe also need to provide the environmental \r\ndepartments of our countries enough human and \r\neconomic resources for them to protect the planet. In \r\nPanama our goal is to restore 50 per cent of the deforested \r\narea over the next 20 years, as well as to protect our \r\noceans. Next year, the Panama Canal expansion project \r\nwill be completed, which will not only give us more \r\nresources to achieve our objectives but will also serve \r\nthe world and global trade.\r\nThe Sustainable Develoment Goals offer us a 2030 \r\nDevelopment Agenda from the perspective of solidarity \r\namong human beings. It is now up to us to respond to \r\nthe legitimate hope of a world with opportunities for \r\nall and with sustainable development. Panama will do \r\nits part, and our country will participate actively in \r\nthat noble undertaking, which is the main challenge \r\nfacing humankind. It is only by meeting the challenge \r\nof sustainable development that we will achieve peace.\r\nI believe that all the members of the Government, \r\nas temporary administrators of the goods and resources \r\nof our peoples, have a great responsibility to ensure \r\nthat politics is understood as serving others, and that \r\npublic funds are used honestly, transparently and fairly \r\nto improve the quality of life of our citizens.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to confirm my commitment \r\nto move my country forward over the five years of my \r\nterm so that we can achieve the 17 Goals. I appeal to \r\nHeads of State and all who share this responsibility to \r\nadminister public funds honestly and transparently so \r\nthat 15 years from now we can look back and feel that \r\ntogether we did our best to ensure that our countries \r\nattain the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama for his statement.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federal Republic \r\nof Nigeria.\r\nMr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Buhari: The Declaration that we have \r\nadopted today (see resolution 70/1) testifies to the \r\nurgency of and the need for action by all of us. It is \r\nnot for want of commitment that previous initiatives \r\nfailed or could not be fully realized. What seemed \r\nto be lacking in the past were political will and the \r\nrequisite global partnerships to pursue and implement \r\nthe programmes to which we committed ourselves. \r\nGlobal consensus is needed. We agreed to deliver \r\nas one and to leave no one behind. That promise was \r\nkept. We have agreed to create viable partnerships and \r\n14/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nto adopt the means of implementation for the Goals and \r\ntargets of a global Sustainable Development agenda in \r\nall its three dimensions: the economic, the social and \r\nthe environmental. \r\nThe post-2015 development agenda and the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), together with \r\nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which we adopted in \r\nJuly 2015, offer us a unique opportunity to address the \r\nunfinished business of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). They also provide the basis for a new set \r\nof global development priorities to usher in a peaceful \r\nand prosperous world.\r\nSince 2000 we have witnessed a number of \r\nareas in which progress has been made in meeting \r\nour commitments. Respect for human rights and \r\naccountability for gross violations are now at the \r\nforefront of most major international initiatives. \r\nNational efforts have been exerted to meet the MDGs \r\nand rescue millions of people from the clutches of \r\nextreme poverty and want. Illnesses such as polio, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria are being systematically \r\nattacked and eliminated from our countries. Maternal \r\nand child mortality, as well as mother-to-child \r\ntransmission of diseases such as HIV/AIDS, are high on \r\nour national agendas. Through a concerted effort by the \r\nworld community, Ebola in West Africa was contained, \r\nthen overcome. \r\nThe prospect of wars and conflicts between and \r\namong States has for the first time in human memory \r\nbeen considerably reduced. Threats to international \r\npeace and security are now caused more by non-State \r\nactors whose terrorist groups pose a more deadly threat \r\nby drawing national armed forces into neighbouring \r\nconflicts. The war against terror is now the most \r\nsignificant effort that we are all called upon to prosecute, \r\nin unison and with renewed determination and vigour. \r\nWe must not lose sight of or diminish the fact that \r\npoverty poses a serious threat to global development. If \r\nwe are truly committed to leave no one behind, we must \r\nthen translate rhetoric into action and fight poverty \r\non a global scale. Illiteracy, hunger and diseases are \r\nassociated with evils that go hand in hand with poverty. \r\nWe must exert all efforts to eliminate those ills from our \r\nmidst by 2030, as the Declaration loudly proclaims. The \r\nbottom billion that have neither a safety net nor social \r\nprotection need to be rescued from their perpetual state \r\nof hopelessness, fear and indignity. \r\nNow that it has fallen on our shoulders to discharge \r\nthat responsibility, we should do so with the enthusiasm \r\nand commitment worthy of the cause. We must create \r\nviable partnerships that bring together national, \r\nregional and global actors with shared objectives to \r\ncarry them forward. We must also create an enabling \r\nenvironment for executing this global Agenda by \r\ndeveloping the relevant framework for working with \r\ndifferent types of partners and constituencies, one that \r\nrecognizes the contributions of civil society, religious \r\nand cultural bodies, the private sector, academia and, \r\nmost important, Government. \r\nJust as the success of the MDGs was underpinned \r\nby national ownership, the post-2015 and the SDG \r\nframeworks must also be guided by national priorities \r\nand ownership. Domestic resource mobilization, \r\nsupplemented by improved terms of trade between \r\nindustrial and developing economies, should drive the \r\nimplementation process in both streams. The facilitation \r\nof remittances by migrant and overseas workers, as well \r\nas efficient tax collection, are needed as complementary \r\nsources of financing for development.\r\nMindful of that, I wish to reiterate Nigeria’s \r\ncommitment to the pursuit of transparent and \r\naccountable fiscal and economic management. We are \r\ntaking measures to improve and streamline the internal \r\ngeneration of revenue and to plug all loopholes that \r\nhave led to illicit capital f light from Nigeria. We are \r\nalso putting in place mechanisms to prevent oil theft \r\nand other criminal practices that are detrimental to \r\nour economy. We are taking concrete steps to address \r\nenvironmental challenges, especially in cleaning up the \r\ngreatest damage to ecosystems caused by oil spillage, \r\nland erosion, desertification and f loods. The threat \r\nposed by climate change is real and present in our \r\ncountry.\r\nIt is my hope that as we embark on this renewed \r\njourney we will match our words with deeds, so that \r\nwhen the General Assembly meets in 2030, the people \r\nof all races and creeds will say that we have kept faith \r\nwith each other.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the \r\nFederal Republic of Nigeria for his statement.\r\nMr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\n15-29155 15/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nPalau.\r\nMr. Tommy Esang Remengesau, Jr., President of \r\nthe Republic of Palau, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Remengesau: It is my great honour to \r\njoin everyone here today to congratulate the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and, for that matter, the global community on \r\nthe adoption of the post-2015 Agenda. It is a privilege to \r\nthank the General Assembly for that signal achievement. \r\nIt is fitting that we take this uniquely important \r\nmoment to recognize the hard work and dedication of \r\nliterally thousands of people from all nations that has \r\nallowed us to gather here today. By virtue of that work \r\nby so many, we now have a strong set of imperatives for \r\nthe transformational change that our peoples and our \r\ncountries need in order to safeguard our planet for the \r\nfuture of our children.\r\nIt is also with deep gratitude and humbleness that \r\nI recognize and acknowledge the leadership of His \r\nHoliness Pope Francis for his inspirational remarks (see \r\nA/70/PV.4) and for his extraordinary encyclical Laudato \r\nSi’. That profoundly important document laments \r\nthe careless use of our planet’s resources leading to \r\nenvironmental degradation and global warming. That \r\nencyclical on climate change, which calls for swift and \r\nunified global action, is an inspiration to us all and \r\nis already beginning to change hearts and minds and \r\nto focus the world’s attention on the most vulnerable \r\namong us and on our mother Earth. \r\nThe encyclical clearly and eloquently states a \r\nfundamental truth: what we do, or do not do, about \r\nclimate change today will affect the lives of countless \r\npeople for many generations to come. His Holiness \r\nspeaks passionately of the impacts of climate change on \r\nthe suffering of the poor. That also is fundamental. The \r\npeople who contribute least to this crisis are suffering \r\nthe most from it. That realization must be part of the \r\nsolution that we will develop in Paris at the end of \r\nthe year. There is still time to tackle climate change, \r\nthe greatest challenge of our times. Human suffering, \r\nand the suffering of all creation, will deepen with \r\neach moment of delay. At the same time, all countries \r\nand all peoples have a role to play in building a more \r\nsustainable future.\r\nThe eight Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) \r\nhelped drive global progress in developing countries. \r\nMost assuredly, they helped to reduce extreme poverty, \r\nimprove health, enhance environmental sustainability \r\nand address gender equality. Today we have before us \r\nthe new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The \r\nnew SDGs are critically important as the next great step \r\nforward beyond the MDGs. These SDGs must raise the \r\nbar of our global commitment to finally address the \r\nroot causes of poverty and environmental degradation.\r\nAs we all know, we have enormous challenges \r\nahead. Over 1 billion people on this fragile planet still \r\nlive on less than $1.25 a day. Almost 1 billion people do \r\nnot have enough to feed themselves or their families. \r\nClimate change is already wreaking havoc in my home, \r\nthe Pacific. Our nations are at present feeling the effects \r\nfrom rising seas, storm surges, droughts, f loods and \r\nocean acidification, which together threaten our water \r\nand food supplies, our marine biodiversity and our very \r\nlivelihoods.\r\nThose enormous challenges are not limited to \r\nmy region. As our new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1) recognizes, there is no \r\nregion on Earth, no country and no people who are not \r\nsuffering — and who will not continue to suffer — until \r\nwe take effective and long-lasting global action. Like \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals are but a blueprint for change and \r\nregeneration. The hard work lies ahead for the global \r\ncommunity, rich and poor nations alike, to make those \r\nGoals real across the broad expanses of our planet and \r\nfor all of our citizens.\r\nIn Palau, we are working hard to do our part and \r\nto take those next steps that will define our future. We \r\nhave committed to provide 20 per cent of our energy \r\nthrough renewable resources by 2020, and are already \r\nthree quarters of the way there. We have also committed \r\nto become carbon-neutral by 2050. In that context, \r\nwe have finalized a comprehensive climate change \r\npolicy and will soon submit our intended, nationally \r\ndetermined contribution.\r\nWe are working hard to protect our ocean — the \r\nfoundation of our culture and the backbone of our \r\nlivelihoods. We have created a comprehensive network \r\nof near-shore marine protected areas and are in the \r\nprocess of establishing the Palau national marine \r\nsanctuary, which will close 80 per cent of our exclusive \r\neconomic zone — an area the size of France — to \r\ncommercial fishing.\r\nRepresenting a small island developing nation, I \r\nmust particularly congratulate and thank the Assembly \r\n16/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nfor the Sustainable Development Goal on the oceans. \r\nThat SDG is enormously important to all of us. It \r\nwill pave the way towards a healthier global marine \r\nenvironment through a well-connected system of \r\nmarine protected areas; the restoration of fish stocks and \r\nthe elimination of illegal, unregulated and unreported \r\nfishing will be addressed.\r\nWhile small nations like mine are taking many \r\nactions on our own to stem the tide of environmental \r\ncollapse, it is only through a true global partnership \r\nfor sustainable development, with the participation of \r\nall countries, all stakeholders and all peoples, that we \r\ncan implement our new list of Sustainable Development \r\nGoals with the speed and scale necessary to respond to \r\nour urgent situation. To move forward, we will need \r\nfunding and technical support to implement, monitor \r\nand strengthen our solutions. And we will need that \r\nsupport sooner rather than later.\r\nGlobal partnership is our only hope. Only through \r\nreal partnerships at every level can we implement the \r\nSDGs in our generation to indeed transform the world. \r\nOnly through partnerships can we hope to realize the \r\npromise of the future we want — a future we need for \r\nour children and all the generations to come.\r\nGod bless our mother Earth.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau for his statement.\r\nThe Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nConstitutional President of the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia.\r\nPresident Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ngreet all the heads of all delegations, representing their \r\ncountries. In the name of the Bolivian people, I note \r\nand pay tribute to the decision of the General Assembly \r\nto discuss and adopt the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1). \r\nFirst, we have to assess what was done with the \r\nMillennium Development Goals and ask ourselves why \r\nwe were unable to achieve them. I would like to say \r\nthat we have to debate thoroughly what are the causes \r\nof poverty, what are the causes of inequality in the \r\nworld, why is it that in some countries, some regions, \r\npoverty — extreme poverty — continues to grow. For \r\nthat I would like to quickly explain that the policies of \r\nthe capitalist system do not solve the current problems \r\nof life and of humankind. \r\nWealth is concentrated not in just a few hands but in \r\njust a few States. The most developed countries are where \r\nthe greatest wealth of the humankind is concentrated, \r\nbut at the same time capitalism allows that a few citizens \r\ncan gather the wealth of various countries and millions \r\nand millions of human beings. Capitalism uses the \r\nenvironment for its own purposes by plundering natural \r\nresources and through environmental degradation. \r\nCapitalism uses the economy in the service of politics. \r\nThe capitalist economy operates through a dictatorship \r\nof the financial system that favours the banks and robs \r\nthe peoples. Capitalism places peoples in extreme \r\npoverty. \r\nWar is the biggest business of capitalism. It cannot \r\nsurvive without producing violence, invading peoples \r\nand plundering strategic resources. The capitalist \r\nsystem underwrites the industry of death — weapons \r\nproduction, military expenditure, military bases and \r\nthe extraterritorial commerce in logistical and security \r\nsystems. Today there are more wars in the world than \r\nin the past, and the destructive capacity of weapons \r\nand technology is unparalleled in the history of \r\nhumankind. Furthermore, more people than ever have \r\nbeen displaced by war, and military expenditures have \r\nrisen to astronomical levels. Never before have we seen \r\nso much spent on destroying people in such a short \r\ntime. For example, the NATO annual budget exceeds \r\n$1 trillion. As a result of imperialist wars, today \r\noceans have been converted into cemeteries of refugees \r\nperishing at sea. Countries have become trenches of \r\nwar. \r\nIf war fuels the economy of a capitalist system, it \r\nfeeds off a sham. Today wars are being manufactured \r\nand leaders demonized. War criminalizes progressive \r\nStates having an anti-capitalist orientation. Worse, \r\ntoday this imperiousness creates real armies of religious \r\nfanatics that cannot be controlled, such as the army of \r\nthe Islamic State. \r\nTo survive, the capitalist system transfers its \r\ncrises to peoples, sometimes by lowering the prices \r\nof oil and other raw materials, sometimes by invading \r\nStates through supposedly just wars, and at other \r\ntimes by imposing economic and financial models to \r\nplunder their natural resources through global financial \r\ninstitutions. In the capitalist model, the major political \r\n15-29155 17/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nand economic decisions are concentrated in the hands \r\nof bankers, businessmen and industrialists, and \r\ndemocracy concludes with the vote.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nTo change the social situation in Bolivia, we worked \r\npolitically to free ourselves from imperialist domination \r\nand economically to free ourselves from the neoliberal \r\nmodel. In doing so, we promoted a comprehensive \r\npolicy of living well, under the guidance and wisdom \r\nof our social movements, because the Bolivian people \r\nare organized in social movements. \r\nIt is very important for us to regain ownership of \r\nour natural resources. We have nationalized our natural \r\nresources, and there is one important thing to keep in \r\nmind: before nationalization and modification of the \r\nhydrocarbons law, the oil revenue was just $300 million \r\na year. Last year we reached $5.6 billion in oil revenues. \r\nThose present here can therefore imagine under a \r\nneoliberal model how much money they stole from us, \r\nhow much money was taken by the international oil \r\ncompanies who were masters of our natural resource.\r\nThanks to the Bolivian people, Bolivia is building \r\na truly plurinational State, where all people have the \r\nsame rights and duties. Earlier, the indigenous people \r\nwere completely excluded. Now we have a classless \r\nState. We had Governments that were imposed on us; \r\nnow it is the people who are in power in Bolivia. \r\nAs for participation in the national economy, earlier \r\nwe were falsely led to believe that the private sector \r\nwould solve Bolivia’s economic problems and that \r\nthe distribution of wealth would lead to equality with \r\ndignity, deepening democracy. In Bolivia economic \r\npolicies are debated and approved with the social \r\nmovements. For the first time, we are beginning to give \r\nadded value to our natural resources.\r\nWe have a patriotic agenda. In 2025, Bolivia will \r\ncelebrate the bicentennial of its founding, with an \r\nagenda to deliver ourselves fully from domination. But \r\nI also want to say how important it is to democratize \r\nand redistribute the national economy. Before, our small \r\neconomy was being privatized and exported. Today, the \r\neconomy remains in Bolivia and is being socialized and \r\ndemocratized, through transfers and actions or through \r\ngoods and revenues, for both grandparents and children.\r\nFortunately, thanks to those policies, in just a short \r\nperiod of time we have reduced extreme poverty from \r\nabout 40 per cent to 17 per cent, and I would like to \r\nsay that Bolivia has achieved most of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. If our economic resources had \r\nremained in the private sector, that would have never \r\nbeen possible.\r\nLastly, I would like to say that, if we wish to end \r\npoverty by 2030 and achieve development for our \r\npeople,, we have to look at how we can put an end \r\nto the values of the capitalist system — selfishness, \r\nindividualism and consumerism. All of us want to \r\neradicate poverty. In order to do so, as elected officials \r\nin our countries, we have the obligation to put an end \r\nto the capitalist system. Thus we will be able to end \r\npoverty.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia for his statement.\r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Boliva, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Socialist Republic of \r\nViet Nam.\r\nMr. Truong Tan Sang, President of the Socialist \r\nRepublic of Viet Nam, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Truong Tan Sang (spoke in Vietnamese; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by delegation): On \r\nbehalf of the State and the people of Viet Nam, I extend \r\nmy warmest greetings to the co-Chairs, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and fellow leaders at this Summit.\r\nAt the dawn of the millennium, 15 years ago, we \r\nadopted a political declaration, the United Nations \r\nMillennium Declaration (resolution 55/2), and endorsed \r\nthe actionable Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), \r\nexpressing a strong commitment to our people’s \r\ndevelopment. Today the economy has witnessed varied \r\nprogress, yet the implementation of the MDGs has \r\nproduced encouraging results throughout the world, \r\nhelping to change the lives of hundreds of millions of \r\npeople. Nevertheless, more than 1 billion people still live \r\nin extreme poverty, and progress on several MDGs fall \r\nshort of our expectations. Challenges such as hunger, \r\npoverty, epidemics, social injustice, the depletion of \r\nnatural resources, environmental degradation, climate \r\nchange, conflicts, crises, escalating violence, instability \r\nand tension in many corners of the world are serious \r\nthreats to peace, security and sustainable development.\r\nIn that context, we gather here today in order to \r\nexpress our strongest commitment to, and support for, \r\n18/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\na truly transformational global development agenda. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, with \r\nits 17 Goals and 169 targets, presents a new strategic \r\nfusion that reflects the aspirations of humankind to live \r\nin a world of peace, safety, equality and justice, a world \r\nwhere development is green, clean and sustainable. \r\nThe Agenda creates a framework and sets the direction \r\nfor all nations to collectively respond to common \r\nchallenges in the three pillars: the economic, the social \r\nand the environmental.\r\nViet Nam wholeheartedly supports the 2030 Agenda, \r\nand we pledge to do our level best to ensure its successful \r\nimplementation. We will mobilize all the necessary \r\nresources. We will engage all ministries, sectors, \r\nlocalities and organizations in our communities. Three \r\npoints require our particular attention.\r\nFirst, peace and development are intertwined. \r\nWe could never expect the MDGs to be achieved in \r\ncircumstances of war, conflict and instability. Only by \r\nensuring peace and stability can we pool the required \r\nresources and foster the partnership necessary for the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs). Therefore, maintaining peace and security, \r\non the basis of respect for international law, is a \r\nprecondition for the successful implementation of the \r\nSDGs. It is incumbent upon all of us to find peaceful \r\nand satisfactory solutions to conflicts and disputes, \r\nexercise restraint, refrain from the use or threat of force \r\nand strengthen cooperation among all countries on the \r\nbasis of equality and mutual benefit.\r\nSecondly, having achieved most MDGs ahead \r\nof schedule, Viet Nam believes that the successful \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda requires strong \r\npolitical will and the full and effective mobilization \r\nof domestic resources. It is necessary to envision \r\nsustainable development as a long-term, people-centred \r\nfinal goal and to mainstream the SDGs into all \r\nnational programmes and strategies, while taking into \r\naccount the specific conditions and circumstances of \r\neach country. As part of its own national sustainable \r\ndevelopment strategy for the period 2011-2020, \r\nViet Nam is committed to accelerating economic \r\nrestructuring and transforming the growth model, \r\nin order to enhance growth and economic efficiency, \r\nensure social equality, preserve natural resources, \r\nprotect the environment and respond to climate change.\r\nThirdly, it is imperative to strengthen the global \r\npartnership for sustainable development. The United \r\nNations can and should play the critical coordinating \r\nrole, along with other international organizations. \r\nDeveloped countries are called upon to take the lead \r\nin supporting developing countries in implementing \r\nthe SDGs, particularly through capacity-building, \r\ntechnology transfer, trade facilitation and access to \r\nfinancial resources.\r\nOn behalf of the Vietnamese people, I would \r\nlike to thank all partners, countries and international \r\norganizations for supporting Viet Nam in its social and \r\neconomic development and MDG implementation over \r\nthe past years. We look forward to further cooperation \r\nand assistance during the achievement of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nViet Nam is working with other States members of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) to \r\nbuild an ASEAN community by the end of 2015, and a \r\nSouth-East Asian nation of peace, stability, cooperation \r\nand prosperity. In order to ensure an environment \r\nconducive to sustainable development, Viet Nam is \r\nworking with ASEAN and its partners in common \r\nefforts to maintain and consolidate peace and security \r\nin the region, including ensuring maritime safety and \r\nsecurity and the freedom of navigation and overflight \r\nin the South China Sea — the main artery connecting \r\nASEAN with other regions. It is our consistent policy \r\nthat all disputes in the South China Sea can be resolved \r\nonly through peaceful means — on the basis of respect \r\nfor international law, including the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 1982, the effective \r\nand full implementation of the Declaration of the \r\nConduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the early \r\nconclusion of the code of conduct for the South China \r\nSea.\r\nI believe that, with strong conviction and political \r\nwill, we will be successful in the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in the \r\ninterests of all the peoples of the world, for a safer and \r\nbetter life of the children of today and tomorrow. Viet \r\nNam pledges to be an active and responsible partner in \r\nthat common endeavour, in order to make sure that no \r\ncountry or individual is left behind.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Socialist \r\nRepublic of Viet Nam for his statement.\r\nMr. Truong Tan Sang, President of the Socialist \r\nRepublic of Viet Nam, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear and \r\naddress by the President of Hungary.\r\n15-29155 19/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nMr. János Áder, President of the Republic of \r\nHungary, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Áder (spoke in Hungarian; English \r\ninterpretation provided by delegation): It has been over \r\n40 years since the publication of the Club of Rome’s \r\nreport The Limits to Growth. For over 40 years, we have \r\nknown that development, which we had once thought \r\nwas without limits, is very difficult to sustain, and it \r\nhas taken more than 40 years for us to finally agree on \r\nsustainable development goals. That happened today, \r\nand we owe our gratitude to everyone who worked \r\non the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1).\r\nHowever, over the course of the past 40 years, the \r\nworld has also changed considerably. Today’s world \r\nhardly resembles the world of 40 years ago. Over the \r\npast 40 years, the population of the world has doubled, \r\nand greenhouse-gas emissions have also doubled. Over \r\nthe past 40 years, the quantity of fresh water per capita \r\nhas decreased by half, and, during those same 40 years, \r\nwe have witnessed an annual loss of agricultural land, \r\nthe area of which represents the size of Belgium. Over \r\nthe past 40 years, some of the key freshwater sources of \r\nprotein have decreased by 75 per cent.\r\nToday we have adopted 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs), with Goal 13 dealing with climate change. \r\nNevertheless, the new Agenda leaves a number of other \r\nissues unresolved. Much work therefore remains to be \r\ndone on the road to the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Paris in December. Accordingly, we can \r\nsafely say that the road we are facing is a long one, \r\nwhile the time we have available is extremely short — a \r\nfar cry from 40 years. Within a few days, there will only \r\nbe 40 days left until we will have to reach an agreement \r\nin Paris. People often cite an East-African saying, to \r\nthe effect that we have not inherited the Earth from \r\nour ancestors to do with it whatever we want; we have \r\nborrowed it from our children. However, considering \r\nthe intended nationally determined contributions to \r\nthe Paris Conference to date, if we do not come to our \r\nsenses, we will wind up destroying and squandering the \r\ninheritance of our children.\r\nClearly, we have adopted impressive Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals in other areas. If the climate \r\nobjectives are not met, the consequences of that failure \r\nwill render all the other Sustainable Development Goals \r\nhopeless. If we are not successful in Paris in reaching \r\nan agreement, if we continue to emit unacceptable \r\nlevels of carbon dioxide, if we continue to further \r\noverheat our planet and if we continue to increase the \r\nadverse impacts we cause, then the ideas of sustainable \r\nagricultural food production and sustainable water \r\nmanagement will remain only dreams. It is not terribly \r\ndifficult to understand that if we continue to reduce the \r\namount of agricultural land, we are also going to reduce \r\nthe amount of food that can be produced. If we continue \r\nto reduce the natural circulation of water — known as \r\nthe hydrological cycle — then natural disasters will \r\nbecome increasingly frequent and impactful. If we \r\ncontinue to see the current rate of acidification of the \r\nseas and oceans, we will endanger the primary food \r\nsource of over 1 billion people.\r\nWhat would the consequences of such a scenario \r\nbe? Rather than decrease, poverty would grow. It would \r\nalso entail an increase in social inequality. As a result, \r\nsocial tensions would also increase, which would not be \r\nconducive to good governance, security or peace— in \r\nfact, such a scenario would render them impossible. In \r\nthe end, that could lead to wars and mass migrations on \r\na scale much greater than that which we are currently \r\nwitnessing.\r\nThis morning, His Holiness Pope Francis said the \r\nfollowing in this very Hall:\r\n“[men are] not authorized to abuse [creation], much \r\nless destroy it” (A/70/PV.3, p. 3).\r\nHe also went on to quote the words of his predecessor, \r\nPope Paul VI, which were uttered in this Hall 50 years \r\nago: “The real peril is in man” (A/PV.1347, para. 45). \r\nAll of us stood up and gave Pope Francis a standing \r\novation for his words. We also gave a standing ovation \r\nfor the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\nOne year ago, at the Climate Summit here on \r\n23 September 2014, we all stood and clapped after \r\nhearing the words of Kathy Jetnil-Kijiner, who came \r\nfrom Marshall Islands and asked us all to agree, as soon \r\nas possible, on the climate objectives — because if we \r\ndid not, she and her fellow citizens would be forced to \r\nmove away from Marshall Islands. If the enthusiasm of \r\nthat moment or today’s is genuine, if the applause back \r\nthen and now was not only for the moment, then I would \r\nask all Member States to reconsider their positions \r\nbefore the Conference in Paris. Please think what we \r\nstand to lose if we do not come to a tangible agreement \r\nat the end of the year in Paris. We do not even have \r\n20/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\ntwo times 40 days to conclude an agreement that will \r\nsubstantially influence the future of our children.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Hungary for his statement.\r\nMr. János Áder, President of the Republic of \r\nHungary, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of Mongolia.\r\nMr. Tsakhia Elbegdorj, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Elbegdorj: At the dawn of the new century \r\nwe adopted — and have since then implemented — the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. We have achieved \r\nmany targets, but have failed to achieve others. By and \r\nlarge, however, the global community passed the test. \r\nWe have all learned lessons and made huge strides.\r\nThis time, the international community has \r\nproduced a history-making document contained \r\nin resolution 70/1. The entire family of the United \r\nNations agreed on the road map towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Now humankind has a truly universal, \r\nambitious action plan for the next 15 years. Never before \r\nin human history has such a universal and unanimous \r\nagreement been reached. We agreed on urgent targets, \r\non a broad range of economic and social challenges and \r\non environmental exigencies. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to express my heartfelt thanks to all those \r\nwho made it possible. I thank Member States for their \r\ntireless work, sleepless nights and firm commitment. \r\nThey have shouldered a mountain of responsibilities to \r\nproduce the truly historic 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment for humankind. Now the responsibility \r\nis on us, the Member States, to ensure its full \r\nimplementation.\r\nMongolia’s commitment to international cooperation \r\nremains strong. The success of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals will mainly depend on a revitalized \r\nglobal partnership, an active engagement on the part of \r\nGovernments, as well as the resilience of and synergy \r\nwith civil society and the private sector.\r\nIt is widely recognized that each country has a \r\nprimary responsibility for its own development, but, at \r\nthe same time, the world community should not forget \r\nthat there are many countries, including the land-locked \r\ndeveloping countries, that are still in need of a helping \r\nhand.\r\nOne thing is certain: every nation State should \r\nalways strive for good governance, the strict rule of \r\nlaw and a sound human rights policy. In order to put \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals into practice, we \r\nneed to have a robust, inclusive and open mechanism \r\nand policies, as outlined in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda on financing for development. We must have \r\nreliable implementing, monitoring and accountability \r\nregulations and institutions in place.\r\nJustice and fairness is the order of the day. Every \r\nnation and Government must actively contribute to the \r\nglobal good with its own capabilities and differentiated \r\nresponsibility. We must also reach a global agreement \r\non climate change later this year in Paris.\r\nWe need to mobilize our full potential to achieve the \r\nprimary purpose of the founding of the United Nations, \r\nnamely, the promotion of peace, respect for human \r\nrights, and inclusive economic and social development.\r\nI believe that, in the twenty-first century, the United \r\nNations will remain at the heart of our humanity.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of Mongolia \r\nfor his statement.\r\nMr. Tsakhia Elbegdorj, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by His Majesty Don Felipe VI, King of the \r\nKingdom of Spain.\r\nHis Majesty Don Felipe VI, King of the Kingdom of \r\nSpain, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nKing Don Felipe VI (spoke in Spanish): It is again \r\na pleasure and a great honour to speak to the United \r\nNations on behalf of Spain. The Heads of Member States \r\nof the United Nations have come here to commit — on \r\nbehalf of our peoples — to transform the world in the \r\nnext 15 years and to rid it of the extreme poverty and \r\nhunger that still aff lict a large portion of humankind. \r\nWe will make a change for everyone, everywhere. That \r\nis our conviction and our commitment.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1), the agenda for change that we adopted \r\ntoday, is the result of a negotiation among equals. It \r\nref lects the voices of millions of citizens. They are the \r\nones who told us what they expect from us. They did \r\nso on behalf of a new generation of children who will \r\nturn 15 in 2030. We are here to solemnly promise those \r\n15-29155 21/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nchildren that each and every one of them will be able \r\nto fully develop their abilities without the hindrance of \r\ndiscrimination.\r\nStanding before them, we are committed to create \r\nsustainable wealth, while giving back to nature what \r\nwe haven take from her, because we are only her guests \r\nand temporary administrators. It is therefore essential \r\nthat the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change to be held \r\nin Paris this coming December be a success and achieve \r\nresults that rise to the challenge we face.\r\nHis Holiness Pope Francis, who has been so close \r\nto us today, teaches us in his encyclical letter Laudato \r\nSi’ that the interdependence that is typical of our time \r\nrequires us to think in terms of a common project. To \r\nthink of a single world requires us to act as one.\r\nIn that spirit, we have already taken decisive steps \r\nthat give us hope, thanks to the Millennium Agenda \r\ninitiated 15 years ago. However, development is not \r\nand has never been a uniform process. Achieving it is \r\nnot guaranteed. Wars like the ongoing one in Syria, \r\nnatural disasters such as the earthquake in Nepal and \r\nepidemics such as Ebola can undo decades of progress \r\nachieved by developing countries, and they demand of \r\nus our solidarity and sustained attention.\r\nEven in the more developed countries, the \r\nexperience of the recent global crises has exposed the \r\nfragility of many situations that we had thought were \r\nmore stable. Above all, it has alerted us to the fact \r\nthat no one is immune to the weaknesses of a growth \r\nmodel that we must now repair and improve, while at \r\nthe same time preserving its strengths and eliminating \r\nits excesses.\r\nThe globalization of finance, technology and \r\ninformation will have to be accompanied by the \r\nglobalization of solidarity, knowledge, equity, liberty \r\nand human dignity.\r\nThe Agenda adopted today is therefore a universal \r\none, and we are all responsible for ensuring its \r\nsuccessful completion. Spain will contribute to that \r\ngoal. My country has already vigorously supported the \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs) through the \r\nMDG Development Goals Fund. Our contribution was \r\nin fact the largest made by any single country towards \r\nachieving the MDGs.\r\nAt present, we are firmly committed to the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and our \r\ncommitment is illustrated by our actions. Working with \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme, we have \r\nestablished the first Sustainable Development Goals \r\nFund, which is already promoting projects in over \r\n17 countries.\r\nOur cooperation policy is also aligned with the \r\n2030 Agenda, and official development assistance is \r\none of its pillars. Together with the European Union, \r\nwe are committed to the goal of providing 0.7 per \r\ncent of our gross domestic product by 2030 — with \r\nan emphasis on the least developed countries. We \r\ncannot forget, however, that a great deal of poverty and \r\nmarginalization occurs in middle-income countries. \r\nAccordingly, we will continue to devote part of our \r\nattention and resources to them.\r\nIt is essential to achieve equitable development, \r\ngenuine and effective enjoyment of rights and \r\nequal opportunities for all. That requires creating \r\nopportunities both in education — hence the importance \r\nof the catalysts of knowledge, innovation and \r\ntechnology — and in job creation, particularly among \r\nyoung people, an area in which Spain is particularly \r\nsensitive.\r\nWe must also ensure equal opportunities for women \r\nin parity with men. They deserve the same roles as men \r\nin the workplace, in the exercise of their political and \r\nsocial rights and in society in general.\r\nThe idea that we are all part of a global community \r\nruled by law and oriented towards the common good \r\nwas put forward by some of the best Spanish minds \r\nat the beginning of modern times, including Father \r\nFrancisco de Vitoria, one of the founders of international \r\nlaw. Seventy years ago, when the Organization was \r\nestablished, the world took a giant step towards \r\nfulfilling that dream. Then as now, the goal that unites \r\nus is to create a community of citizens conscious of \r\ntheir responsibilities in relation to their neighbours and \r\nthe planet that they inhabit. We, the people of Spain \r\nof twenty-first century, believe in that dream, and we \r\nwould like to make it a reality. It is our conviction. It is \r\nour commitment.\r\nThe President: I thank His Majesty Don Felipe VI, \r\nKing of the Kingdom of Spain, for his statement.\r\nHis Majesty Don Felipe VI, King of the Kingdom of \r\nSpain, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Swiss Federation.\r\n22/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nMs. Simonetta Sommaruga, President of the Swiss \r\nFederation, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Sommaruga (spoke in French): In the \r\nframework of a unique process, 193 States have come \r\nhere today and agreed on an ambitious agenda for \r\na sustainable world. They were not, however, alone \r\nin putting that process into place. International civil \r\nsociety, the private sector, scientists as well as experts \r\nfrom the United Nations all played an active role. \r\nConsultations were held in over 100 countries, and more \r\nthan 7 million people took part in a survey that gave \r\nthem an opportunity to voice their needs and priorities. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\n(resolution 70/1) is therefore an Agenda of the people, \r\nby the people and for the people. We all know the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is not a \r\nmagic wand that will simply wish away all the world’s \r\nproblems. However, I firmly believe that the Agenda is \r\nan extremely promising approach to resolving many of \r\nthe world’s problems.\r\nFor Switzerland, the following points became \r\nclear from the very beginning of the process. We \r\ncould no longer remain satisfied with solely promoting \r\ndevelopment in the southern hemisphere, while what is \r\nknown as the developed world carried on with business \r\nas usual. We could not lose sight of the environment \r\nwhen we think about social and economic development. \r\nAnd development could be sustainable without respect \r\nfor human rights and the protection of the rule of law.\r\nPeople are at the heart of the Goals enshrined in \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We \r\nwill not be able to honour that often-cited pledge \r\nunless we adhere to our own principle of leaving no \r\none behind, unless we pay special attention to the most \r\nmarginalized and most vulnerable, unless we counter \r\ngrowing injustices with a culture of equity, unless we \r\npreserve our natural resources, and unless we provide \r\nyoung people with future job prospects. Switzerland \r\nhas accordingly focused its efforts on the following \r\ngoals.\r\nFirst, we have concentrated on the issue of water. \r\nThat extends beyond access to drinking water and \r\nsanitation infrastructure. Thanks to the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, today more than twice the \r\nnumber of people than before — over 4.2 billion \r\nindividuals — have access to piped drinking water.\r\nSecondly, Switzerland has also advocated, in an \r\nad hoc fashion, in favour of an ambitious goal in the \r\narea of gender equality. Over the past 15 years, gender \r\nequality has been successfully achieved, to a large \r\nextent, among primary-school teachers. We must now \r\nachieve gender equality in all areas of society. In most \r\ncountries, a woman’s salary still represents only 60 to \r\n75 per cent of a man’s average salary; and although the \r\npercentage of women members of national Parliaments \r\nhas almost doubled over the past 20 years, women still \r\nrepresent only 22 per cent of all members of Parliaments \r\nin the world.\r\nThirdly, Switzerland has also committed itself to \r\nthe goal of promoting inclusive societies fully dedicated \r\nto peace in order to strengthen the rule of law, access to \r\njustice, respect for human rights and the fight against \r\nviolence and corruption.\r\nFourthly, Switzerland has undertaken a goal \r\nspecific to health care that addresses non-communicable \r\ndiseases, sexually transmitted diseases, reproductive \r\nhealth and related rights. Non-communicable \r\ndiseases are responsible for over 60 per cent of all \r\ndeaths — a phenomenon that is particularly present \r\nin low- and middle-income countries — even though \r\na large portion of non-communicable diseases can be \r\nprevented.\r\nThose goals must be implemented. For that reason, \r\nwe have strongly advocated for an effective follow-\r\nup mechanism and review. We firmly believe that the \r\nHigh-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development \r\nis well positioned to carry out that function.\r\nIn Switzerland we have a system of direct democracy, \r\nwith very wide-ranging rights relating to political self-\r\ndetermination. Our society and our citizens are used \r\nto having a say in the political process. Over the past \r\n200 years, more than one third of all referendums held \r\nworldwide have taken place in Switzerland. For us, \r\ntherefore, it was no challenge to include — from the \r\nvery beginning — representatives of our civil society, \r\nthe private sector and the scientific and political fields \r\nin the process of defining our priorities for the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. In implementing \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, we will proceed \r\nwith the same approach: while politicians will be left \r\nwith the responsibility for guiding the process, citizens \r\nwill be given the opportunity to have their voices heard.\r\nAs we all know, one of the biggest challenges in \r\nthis globalized era consists in establishing a closer \r\nrelationship and greater trust between citizens and the \r\npolitical sphere and its institutions. That is why the \r\n15-29155 23/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nparticipatory process in the development of the 2030 \r\nAgenda was so important. Now, let us get to work \r\ntogether and for the common good.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Swiss \r\nFederation for her statement.\r\nMs. Simonetta Sommaruga, President of the Swiss \r\nFederation, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Honduras.\r\nMr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President \r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nPresident Hernández Alvarado (spoke in Spanish): \r\nHonduras has come to the General Assembly today to \r\ncommit its political will and efforts to achieving the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (resolution \r\n70/1). One year ago in this very Hall, I spoke of the \r\ntragic situation of migrants, and in particular that of \r\nunaccompanied minors, from the northern triangle \r\nof Central America f lowing towards the United \r\nStates (see A/69/PV.7). They are people driven out \r\nby violence and grinding poverty, the result of drug \r\ntrafficking in the North and the operations of cartels \r\nand international organized crime in the region. On that \r\noccasion, I proposed a plan, the Alliance for Prosperity \r\nin the Northern Triangle, intended to improve security \r\nand create opportunities and genuine development \r\nalong our immigration route. That joint initiative \r\nof the Governments of Guatemala, El Salvador and \r\nHonduras was welcomed by President Obama and his \r\nAdministration and by many members of the United \r\nStates House of Representatives and Senate. Currently, \r\na generous proposal in support of that plan for prosperity \r\nof Central America is under consideration in the United \r\nStates Congress.\r\nWe have made real progress in the areas of public \r\nsafety and job opportunities. We can also show \r\nreal improvements in combating drug trafficking \r\nand insecurity. That can be clearly seen in the \r\nreduction in the murder rate and in drug trafficking-\r\nrelated crimes. We have dramatically reduced drug \r\ntrafficking throughout our territory. We have destroyed \r\nclandestine infrastructure, such as aeroplane landing \r\nstrips and drug laboratories. We have apprehended and \r\nprosecuted many drug traffickers. We have extradited \r\npowerful drug lords and seized their ill-gotten gains. \r\nNevertheless, we will not rest until we have completely \r\nrooted out the drug scourge from our territory, which \r\nhas done so much harm to our peoples and region and, \r\nindeed, all humankind.\r\nOn creating opportunities and combating poverty, \r\nwe have developed the Vida Mejor programme with \r\nthe goal of improving the living conditions of poorer \r\npeople. Evidence of the programme’s effectiveness \r\ncan be seen every day in Honduras. Through the \r\nVida Mejor programme and the legal framework of \r\nthe social protection system, recently adopted by our \r\nNational Congress, we are working on the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals in the areas of income, education, \r\nhealth, quality of life, family housing and, in particular, \r\nin generating productive employment for women.\r\nToday, we realize that that is the most effective \r\nway of channelling resources and programmes to \r\nfight poverty. As we had anticipated, the fewer drugs \r\nthere are, the more security there is; and the more \r\ndevelopment there is, the more opportunities there are, \r\nleading to a reduction in the migration f lowing from \r\nHonduras into other countries. It is not just Honduras \r\nthat holds that view; that fact is also affirmed by the \r\nmigration authorities of Mexico and the United States.\r\nHowever, despite those gains, we still face \r\nchallenges. We must do more to reduce poverty, infant \r\nmortality and maternal mortality and to maintain \r\ndisease control, particularly the control of HIV/AIDS. \r\nThose challenges constitute a social, economic, political \r\nand, above all, moral debt that cannot be ignored and \r\ncannot be delayed in its repayment. The progress we \r\nhave made, on which we place such high hopes, has not \r\nbeen easy.\r\nIn addition to the fight against drug trafficking and \r\npoverty, we must also deal with the challenging effects \r\nof climate change in Honduras. Our country is one of \r\nthe three most vulnerable countries in the world, as \r\nnoted in a risk index prepared by an organization called \r\nGerman Watch. I repeat: the third most vulnerable \r\ncountry in the world. That vulnerability became \r\nevident with the onset of the El Niño phenomenon. For \r\nthe second consecutive year, drought, the most severe \r\nrecorded since the middle of the twentieth century, \r\nhas generated critical risks to food security for the \r\nHonduran people and a genuine national emergency. \r\nSuch an emergency is a serious obstacle in our fight \r\nagainst poverty, and it increases the risk of tragically \r\nexacerbating the undesirable migration processes.\r\nWhat does the El Niño climate-change phenomenon \r\nrepresent for Honduras? Most of our harvests have \r\n24/25 15-29155\r\nA/70/PV.5 25/09/2015\r\nbeen lost, especially food crops. We are losing our \r\nlivestock, and in many communities, water is becoming \r\nincreasingly scarce. More than 250,000 Honduran \r\nfamilies have been left in a critical situation. Our \r\nGovernment is assisting the affected families with \r\nour own resources and with those that we hope will be \r\ngenerously contributed by organizations and friendly \r\nGovernments. In a major effort, we are determined \r\nto dedicate nearly one third of our territory, or more \r\nthan 3 million hectares, to be protected areas so as to \r\ndefend the health of planet Earth and to preserve our \r\nenvironmental heritage. Today, as a result of climate \r\nchange, a severe plague of bark weevils has led to \r\nthe loss of 112,000 hectares of pine forests — almost \r\n7 per cent of the total coniferous forests in the country. \r\nBecause of El Niño, and climate change in general, \r\ntoday we must radically change our production and \r\nenergy matrices, as we need to immediately implement \r\nour national master plan for managing water, soils and \r\nforests. We must do that now, not next year or within \r\nthe next decade, but immediately, right now.\r\nFrom this rostrum, one can look out at the Assembly \r\nand see that we all appear alike. Nevertheless, with all \r\ndue respect, from the climate-change standpoint, we are \r\nnot all the same. We are not the same with regard to the \r\ncauses and effects of climate change. Today, it seems \r\nthat the countries in the worst situation, the poorest \r\ncountries, the countries most affected, are the ones \r\nthat have to pay for climate change. We could say that \r\nhumankind will become mature only if we can accept \r\nthat there are common and shared responsibilities, \r\nalbeit different ones, in the generation of climate \r\nchange, so there must also be shared responsibilities in \r\nfinding solutions.\r\nTherefore, those who have contributed the most \r\nto generating the crisis should contribute the most to \r\nsolving it. We must do that together, of course — together \r\nbecause we are all owners and inhabitants of planet \r\nEarth, and not one of us is planning to move anywhere \r\nelse. On behalf of Honduras, I call upon all nations of the \r\nworld, especially the most developed countries, to work \r\nto achieve the Sustainable Development Goals and to \r\ndeal with the challenges and effects of climate change \r\nwithin the framework of co-responsibility, which all, \r\nwithout exception, should recognize as the principle \r\nguiding the actions of the international community. \r\nThe time has come to assume our joint responsibility \r\nas a moral and political imperative. In that firm but \r\nrespectful belief, I call on the leaders of the world to \r\nwork together to preserve this nation that we call the \r\nEarth.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Honduras for his statement.\r\nMr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President \r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nPresident Mugabe: Fifteen years ago, in a \r\nsetting similar to today’s, we adopted the Millennium \r\nDeclaration (resolution 55/2), which, through the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, mobilized global \r\nefforts aimed at meeting the pressing development \r\nchallenges we faced at the time. On balance, some \r\nprogress has been made in meeting those goals, but \r\noverall it has been unsatisfactory and insufficient. The \r\nuneven progress made within and among countries and \r\nregions has widened inequalities and in some cases \r\ndeepened poverty.\r\nOur gathering at this Summit therefore confirms \r\nour shared conclusion that the battle against poverty, \r\ninequality, exclusion and global warming is far from \r\nbeing won. It is also confirmation of our shared resolve \r\nto broaden the scope of our actions and launch an all-\r\nout war whose ultimate goal is the transformation of \r\nthe world we live in today. To say that our development \r\nagenda for the next 15 years is ambitious does not quite \r\ndescribe the enormity of the transformational vision we \r\nhave set ourselves.\r\nThe success of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which we have adopted today (resolution \r\n70/1), will depend on several factors. Key among them \r\nare the concrete actions we will take at the national level \r\nto domesticate this international Agenda. In Zimbabwe, \r\nfollowing a series of multistakeholder participatory \r\nconsultations, including with development partners, \r\nwe adopted a national position on how to align the new \r\nAgenda with our national development priorities. These \r\nare contained in Zimbabwe’s agenda for sustainable \r\nsocioeconomic transformation, which is based on four \r\npillars — food security and nutrition, social services \r\nand poverty eradication, infrastructure and utilities \r\nand, lastly, value addition and beneficiation. Zimbabwe \r\nacknowledges that the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n15-29155 25/25\r\n25/09/2015 A/70/PV.5\r\nare integrated and indivisible. But due to our limited \r\nresources, there are severe constraints on our ability \r\nto implement all of them at the same time. Inevitably, \r\ntherefore, we have had to prioritize their implementation. \r\nI want to confirm and underline, nevertheless, that \r\nZimbabwe is committed to implementing all the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. As resources become \r\navailable we will naturally adjust the basket of goals \r\nthat we are implementing at any one time.\r\nIn the context of my country’s implementation of the \r\nnew Agenda, our key priority and critical challenge is to \r\nput the economy back on a sustained growth trajectory. \r\nThe reforms we are undertaking, including measures \r\ndesigned to attract investments, will materialize if the \r\nunjustified sanctions that Zimbabwe has been subjected \r\nto for the past 15 years are removed. In the spirit of \r\nthe transformative Agenda we are all about to subscribe \r\nto, we call for their unconditional and immediate \r\nremoval. Freed of the fetters of sanctions, my country \r\nstands a better chance of achieving its national vision \r\nof sustainable, inclusive growth, human-centred \r\ndevelopment, structural transformation and poverty \r\neradication. I repeat: remove these sanctions. They are \r\nharming our country.\r\nIn pledging that no one will be left behind as \r\nwe embark on this collective journey, our Agenda is \r\na truly empowering instrument and mechanism. In \r\nZimbabwe, we have adopted and are implementing \r\nseveral programmes aimed at empowering our \r\npreviously disadvantaged people. A key component \r\nof our empowerment agenda has been a land reform \r\nprogramme that, in contradiction of its detractors, has \r\nlifted many families out of poverty. In the spirit of the \r\nnew Agenda, we are determined to leave no one behind. \r\nWe will therefore continue to refine and adjust our \r\nempowerment programmes so that they reach all the \r\nvulnerable and disadvantaged groups in our country.\r\nIt is critical that adequate financial resources be \r\nmobilized and made available if our new Agenda is to \r\nbe successfully implemented. The focus on domestic \r\npublic resources as the development Agenda’s major \r\nsource of funding corresponds to the principle of the \r\nprimacy of national ownership of it. In order to generate \r\nthe required levels of resources, national economies \r\nmust grow. For growth to be achieved, in addition to \r\nappropriate domestic policies, our countries need a \r\ncoherent and supportive international environment. \r\nThis transformative Agenda must therefore not be \r\nlimited to a national level but must also extend to the \r\ninternational arena, so that the systemic issues that \r\nimpede our countries’ development can be addressed.\r\nWe must reinforce international cooperation aimed \r\nat stemming the haemorrhaging of Africa’s resources \r\nthat results from transfer pricing, tax evasion and other \r\ncriminal activities. We should redouble our efforts to \r\nagree on the Doha Development Agenda and put in \r\nplace a universal, rules-based, predictable, transparent, \r\ninclusive, non-discriminatory and equitable trading \r\nsystem. Reform of the Bretton Woods institutions is \r\nlong overdue. The issue of debt sustainability calls \r\nfor urgent, clear-headed resolution. These are not \r\nnew issues; they have been with us for too long. They \r\nconstitute a huge part of the baggage that we must shed \r\nif the transformative new Agenda is to succeed. We \r\nhope that in adopting it, all of us are aware of what \r\nit entails. We hope that we are similarly committed to \r\nshedding old habits and contributing to ushering in the \r\npotentially glorious era that our new Agenda promises.\r\nThe success of our Agenda calls for more, not less, \r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity. The fact that \r\nwe are enlarging the circle of our partnerships should \r\nnot weaken existing ones or the mutual responsibilities \r\nwe already share. In fact, it should strengthen them. The \r\nuniversality of this Agenda is not just that it applies to \r\nall of us but also that it belongs to all of us. It promises a \r\nbrave new world, a new world that we must consciously \r\nconstruct, a new world that calls for the creation of a \r\nnew global citizen. I want to believe that we are up \r\nto this task that we have voluntarily and collectively \r\ncommitted ourselves to. Our success and, in particular, \r\nthe promise of a new world that awaits us depend on \r\nthat commitment.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe for his statement.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
