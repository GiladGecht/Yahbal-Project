(Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Zamora Rivas \r\n(El Salvador), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.20 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President \r\nof the Republic of Portugal\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Portugal.\r\nMr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Portugal, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Marcelo \r\nRebelo de Sousa, President of the Republic of Portugal, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rebelo de Sousa: First of all, I would like \r\nto congratulate the President of the General Assembly, \r\nMr. Peter Thomson, on his election and commend him \r\nfor the theme chosen for the seventy-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Following the success a year ago \r\nof the adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwe need a universal push to transform our world. The \r\nGeneral Assembly may rest assured that it can count on \r\nPortugal’s committed contribution. I would also like to \r\nextend Portugal’s recognition to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his capacity for dialogue, vision \r\nfor the future and commitment to promoting a more \r\nefficient United Nations.\r\n(spoke in Portuguese; English text provided by \r\nthe delegation)\r\nIn an increasingly complex world, the Organization \r\nwill always be an irreplaceable institution in the eyes of \r\nits Members. I therefore reiterate Portugal’s unwavering \r\nand enduring commitment to the United Nations, the \r\nCharter and its guiding purposes and principles, as well \r\nas its strict respect for international law. The historic \r\nagreements, on the Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nclimate change, reached in 2015 and 2016, respectively, \r\nthe World Humanitarian Summit and the General \r\nAssembly special session on the world drug problem \r\nwere all major achievements that exemplified effective, \r\nUnited Nations-centred multilateralism.\r\nThe General Assembly’s special session on the \r\nworld drug problem, held in April, was an important \r\nstep forward taken by the international community to \r\nrealize an integrated and humanist vision. Having held \r\nsuch a vision for over a decade, Portugal regards it as \r\nthe necessary and successful global response. In this as \r\nin other domains, we must now make additional efforts \r\nand focus primarily on prevention.\r\nA culture of prevention should also be developed in \r\nthe area of maintaining peace and security by promoting \r\nsustainable development and respect for human rights, \r\nwith the ultimate aim of safeguarding human dignity, \r\nrelieving suffering and ending poverty. To this end, I \r\nwould like to highlight this year’s review of the United \r\nNations peace and security architecture, including the \r\nwomen and peace and security dimension. It provided \r\nan opportunity to reinforce United Nations preventive \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

For example, strengthening preventive \r\naction in Africa is essential to prevent many of the \r\ncrises the continent is facing from developing, while \r\nrespecting African ownership of the processes. Portugal \r\nwill continue to contribute to this effort, in particular \r\nby deploying military contingents in such peacekeeping \r\noperations as the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali and the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in the Central African Republic .\r\nIt is also worth noting our commitment to promoting \r\nmaritime security in the Gulf of Guinea, as can be \r\nseen in our current presidency of the Group of Seven \r\nGroup of Friends of the Gulf of Guinea. We continue \r\nto support Guinea-Bissau and we are confident that \r\nconstructive political dialogue will be undertaken to \r\nreach a sustainable solution within the constitutional \r\nframework in order to meet the legitimate aspirations \r\nof the Guinean people. We also believe that a meeting \r\nof the International Contact Group on Guinea-Bissau \r\nneeds to be held with the utmost urgency in order to \r\nreassert the international community’s consensus in \r\nfavour of long-awaited structural reforms.\r\nOn the other side of the Atlantic, we welcomed the \r\ntalks held in Havana, which led to a peace agreement \r\nfor Colombia, one of Portugal’s partners at Ibero-\r\nAmerican summits. That agreement paves the way for \r\nnational reconciliation among all Colombians, which \r\nwill allow them to live together in peace and in respect \r\nfor the rule of law and the views of others. We will \r\nparticipate in the peacekeeping process by contributing \r\npersonnel to the prospective United Nations mission, as \r\nwell as financially through the European Union Trust \r\nFund for Colombia.\r\nIt is the Israeli-Palestinian issue, however, that \r\ndemonstrates that there is still a way to go in terms of \r\npeacebuilding. That is why I would reiterate Portugal’s \r\nsupport for international efforts aimed at bringing \r\nabout the resumption of peace talks. We hope that \r\nUnited Nations resolutions can provide a basis for \r\na sustainable solution to the conflict with a view to \r\nensuring the existence of a sovereign, independent and \r\nviable Palestinian State living side by side with the \r\nState of Israel, whose legitimate security aspirations \r\nmust be guaranteed. \r\nFurthermore, we are also very concerned about \r\nthe recent escalation of threats to security and stability \r\non the Korean peninsula, which we condemn. We \r\ncall for resumed collaboration among neighbours \r\nand the international community aimed at having the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea suspend its \r\nnuclear programme.\r\nFrom the subway station in Brussels to Mogadishu \r\nairport, from a club in Orlando to Quetta hospital in \r\nPakistan, the pure inhumanity of these terrorist attacks \r\nis not just against the targeted countries and the victims; \r\nrather, it is against all those who endorse the principles \r\nand values of the United Nations Charter — the 193 \r\nStates gathered here today — and it is against humankind \r\nas a whole. Terrorism cannot be tolerated. The United \r\nNations, through its mandate from the international \r\ncommunity, has the lawful right and the moral duty \r\nto end this scourge, and specifically one of its major \r\nproponents, Da’esh. We shall not give in to fear, nor \r\nshall we forfeit our values or principles, particularly \r\nwith regard to human rights. It is through the values of \r\npeace, tolerance, human dignity and solidarity that we \r\nshould fight radicalization and violent extremism, as \r\nwell as the xenophobia and demagogic populism that \r\nthreaten our societies.\r\nThe Middle East, North Africa and Europe are \r\nconfronting a humanitarian crisis of tragic proportions \r\nresulting from the exodus of refugees and migrants, \r\nmany of whom are very young children. We must get \r\nto the root of the problem and eradicate the terror and \r\nfear that have befallen the region, finding a politically \r\nsustainable solution for the conflict in Syria based on \r\nthe recently negotiated ceasefire.\r\nAnother issue underlying this humanitarian crisis is \r\nthe growing wave of immigration that is essentially the \r\nresult of a lack of opportunities in the migrants’ countries \r\nof origin. Resolving conflicts, stabilizing political \r\nsituations and investing in countries’ development are \r\nsurely the best way to contribute to the stability and \r\nprosperity of all. Portugal has turned the willingness it \r\nexpressed from the beginning of the crisis into the act \r\nof hosting migrants who need international protection. \r\nWe have gone far beyond the European Union quota \r\nset out for us. Indeed, we have accepted twice the \r\nnumber of migrants than required under this quota. We \r\nwill continue to take in these migrants and abide by \r\nthe effective integration practices that characterize the \r\nwelcoming and multicultural Portuguese society.\r\nI would like to stress the importance of promoting \r\nhigher education for refugees in emergency situations \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 3/30\r\nso that a generation of migrants is not lost. Portugal has \r\nalready accepted over 100 Syrian university students \r\nand calls for similar involvement on the part of many \r\nother countries. I myself am a university professor, and \r\nI have taught students from Syria.\r\nWith regard to the right to education, I would \r\nrecall that 50 years ago the General Assembly adopted \r\nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights and the International Covenant on Civil \r\nand Political Rights. I call on all Member States that \r\nhave not yet done so to join these important instruments. \r\nIn addition, on the issue of human rights, we have \r\ncome a long way in terms of gender equality, although \r\nmuch still needs to be done. Gender issues are a topic of \r\ncross-cutting importance, particularly in the context of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nwomen and peace and security agenda. Furthermore, \r\nas a member of the Human Rights Council, Portugal \r\nremains committed to the defence and promotion of \r\nhuman rights and the strengthening of bodies set up by \r\nhuman rights treaties.\r\nThe issue of oceans and seas is a priority for Portugal. \r\nHistory advises it, geography imposes it and the future \r\ndemands it. In this regard, I would mention the Oceans \r\nMeeting 2016, which we hosted in Lisbon earlier this \r\nyear. We will continue to work towards mobilizing \r\nglobal efforts aimed at the conservation and sustainable \r\nexploitation of the oceans. Accordingly, Portugal is \r\nlooking forward to being an engaged participant at \r\nthe first United Nations Conference to Support the \r\nImplementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, on \r\noceans, seas and marine resources, which will be held in \r\nNew York in 2017. Furthermore, with regard to the link \r\nto climate change, I reiterate Portugal’s commitment to \r\nsmall island developing States in supporting the efforts \r\nneeded to overcome the challenges they face, which are \r\nthe responsibility of the international community as \r\na whole.\r\nFinally, as the process of appointing the next \r\nSecretary-General is under way, I would like to express \r\nmy sincerest wish that whoever takes up this position \r\nhas the human and professional qualities required to \r\nmeet the challenge. He or she should possess the ability \r\nto bring together hearts and minds and embody the \r\nvalues and courses of action that Mahatma Gandhi and \r\nNelson Mandela exemplified in their lives. We need \r\nsomeone who transcends their group or circle, uniting \r\nand representing everyone and not just a chosen few, \r\nwho will build bridges, listen and demonstrate the \r\ninnate wisdom and leadership skills to make decisions \r\nwith which everyone can identify and in which everyone \r\nfeels included.\r\nAs Vergílio Ferreira, a great Portuguese writer, \r\nsaid, “Mine is the language of the sea.” The Portuguese \r\nlanguage is shared by 250 million speakers, represented \r\nby the nine States members of the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries, which celebrates its \r\ntwentieth anniversary this year. Inspired, therefore, by \r\nthe ocean — to some it is the Atlantic, to others it is the \r\nPacific — which brings life to the planet and unites us \r\nall, I have come to address the General Assembly today. \r\nI wish the Assembly every success in the seventy-first \r\nsession that we are now launching, reiterating that we \r\nsupport new President of the Assembly and welcome \r\nhis leadership. Portugal’s position is, has been and \r\nalways will be to provide firm, enthusiastic support to \r\nthe United Nations as it fulfils its role in building peace, \r\nliberty, development and justice throughout the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Portugal for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Portugal, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of \r\nthe United Mexican States\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe United Mexican States.\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Enrique Peña \r\nNieto, President of the United Mexican States, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Peña Nieto (spoke in Spanish): It is \r\nan honour and a privilege to stand here once again at \r\nthis high rostrum at the United Nations, the home of \r\nuniversal peace, cooperation and brotherhood. Mexico \r\nhas always been a staunch ally of the United Nations \r\nand a nation that firmly believes in its transformative \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n4/30 16-29415\r\npower. From this Hall, vital collective efforts have been \r\nundertaken in pursuit of humankind’s noblest causes.\r\nFor over seven decades, global voices have called \r\nfor a better future. Each generation has taken on \r\nthe challenges of its time with determination. It is \r\nincumbent upon us to continue in the same spirit to \r\nconfront the enormous challenge of making sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the planet a reality. We have already \r\ntaken the first step in that direction, specifically by \r\ndefining the Sustainable Development Goals. The \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which \r\nwe formulated and agreed on here at the United \r\nNations, is without a doubt the boldest, noblest and \r\nmost demanding action plan that the international \r\ncommunity has adopted in recent history. It is a road \r\nmap for national and subnational Governments, just \r\nas it is for all of society’s stakeholders that have the \r\nmission of improving the lives of billions of people and \r\nleaving no one behind. Because of its scope and goals, \r\nthe 2030 Agenda is the framework that harmonizes the \r\nagreements reached last year in the areas of human \r\nrights, environment and sustainable peace.\r\nWhat have the national efforts of Mexico been in this \r\narena? First of all, we have taken on the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda as a national commitment. Along the \r\nsame lines, work is under way to establish a high-level \r\ncouncil for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda, \r\nwhich will be headed by the President of the republic. \r\nIts purpose will be to coordinate the work of the various \r\nstakeholders, including local authorities, lawmakers, \r\nand representatives of civil society, academia and the \r\nprivate sector. Mexico has also set up a specialized \r\ntechnical committee composed of the main federal \r\ninstitutions, tasked with measuring and monitoring \r\nthe Agenda’s indicators. Similarly, we are creating a \r\npublic monitoring dashboard in order to transparently \r\nshare our successes and remaining challenges with the \r\npublic. As part of that commitment to transparency and \r\naccountability, Mexico was one of the 22 countries that \r\non 19 July presented their voluntary national review \r\ndocuments to the high-level political forum.\r\nMexico is also committed to promoting the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda at the regional \r\nlevel. In April next year we will chair the Forum of \r\nthe Countries of Latin American and the Caribbean on \r\nSustainable Development. Given that human rights are \r\nnow a cross-cutting element in the 2030 Agenda, my \r\ncountry has adopted a national social inclusion strategy \r\nfocused on ensuring the full enjoyment of social rights, \r\nthereby reducing poverty and increasing equality. \r\nWe applaud the recognition in the 2030 Agenda of \r\nmigrants as subjects of rights and as vital allies in the \r\ndevelopment of their countries of destination and origin. \r\nAs I stated yesterday at the plenary meeting (see A/71/\r\nPV.4B ), Mexico will work actively for the creation of \r\nagreements on migration and refugees. To that end, \r\nwe have offered to host an international preparatory \r\nmeeting for reaching a better definition of the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration. In the \r\nface of these challenges, we should leave behind our \r\nindifference and promote the shared responsibility and \r\njoint action of the international community with regard \r\nto migrants and refugees. \r\nAnother cross-cutting theme of the 2030 Agenda \r\nis gender perspective and the empowerment of women. \r\nIn keeping with the commitments of last year’s Global \r\nLeaders’ Meeting on Gender Equality and Women’s \r\nEmpowerment: A Commitment to Action, Mexico now \r\nhas a more robust institutional framework in its national \r\nsystem for equality between women and men. The fact \r\nthat that system is headed by Mexico’s President ensures \r\nthat the policy of equality is upheld at the highest level \r\nand is reflected in the national Government’s actions. \r\nAdditionally, driven by a sense of urgency, \r\nMexico has adopted the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. A few days ago my country’s Ssenate ratified \r\nthat international treaty, which will be submitted for \r\nentry into force at tomorrow’s high-level meeting. Our \r\npriority now is to develop national mechanisms to \r\ncoordinate, verify and report on compliance with the \r\ncommitments assumed under that agreement.\r\nWe must henceforward change the way we live, \r\nproduce and consume. We must harmonize economic \r\ndevelopment with social inclusion and environmental \r\nprotection. One example of that balance can be seen in \r\nmy country’s energy reform, which includes a law of \r\nenergy transition whereby, by 2018, 25 per cent of its \r\nelectric energy will be generated using clean sources, \r\nreaching 70 per cent by 2040. Similarly, at the regional \r\nlevel, the three North American nations have committed \r\nto reducing our oil and gas sectors’ methane emissions \r\nby between 40 and 45 per cent by 2025.\r\nAs part of its global responsibility to the environment, \r\nMexico will host the thirteenth Conference of the \r\nParties to the Convention on Biological Diversity, to be \r\nheld in December. That forum seeks to align actions to \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 5/30\r\nprotect and preserve our natural heritage with the Aichi \r\nBiodiversity Targets and those of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nBy the same token, next year we will host the Global \r\nPlatform for Disaster Risk Reduction, which will \r\nassess the first two years of the Sendai Framework for \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction and will set goals for reducing \r\nand mitigating development risks.\r\nThirdly, Mexico has reaffirmed its pacifist vocation \r\nand its commitment to achieving sustainable global \r\npeace. The international community has confirmed \r\nthat the stability of countries affected by armed conflict \r\ndepends not only on their security conditions, but also \r\non their respect for human rights, on the effectiveness \r\nof their institutions and the rule of law, and on their \r\nability to foster inclusive development. This cross-\r\ncutting vision is fully in line with the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. In that regard, the Goals are key to \r\npreventing and avoiding social and political crises and \r\nwill also be crucial to finding peaceful solutions to the \r\narmed conflicts in many countries. \r\nThe most recent example is the peace agreement \r\nreached in Colombia. Mexico applauds that achievement, \r\nand we will show our solidarity with the attainment of \r\nits goals. Similarly, in the pursuit of reduced tension and \r\ngreater understanding in our region, Mexico repeats its \r\ncall for the lifting of the economic, trade and financial \r\nblockade imposed upon Cuba. \r\nIf peace is to last, it must be sustainable. To that end, \r\nthe new paradigm entails focusing efforts on conflict \r\nprevention and using a proactive, strategic and long-\r\nterm approach. We recognize that one of the greatest \r\nthreats is the existence of nuclear weapons. Historically, \r\nMexico has been a proponent of disarmament and has \r\nemphatically condemned nuclear tests. We will continue \r\nto work towards a world free of that global threat.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to recognize \r\nthe positive work of Mr. Ban Ki-moon at the head of \r\nthe United Nations Secretariat. Mexico appreciates \r\nhis dedication and commitment. Thanks to his vision \r\nand leadership, agreements of great importance for the \r\nfuture of the planet have been reached in recent years. \r\nThat is no minor feat, especially given the highly \r\nvolatile and complex international context in which he \r\nhas had to perform his duties.\r\nIn recent decades, the world has made great \r\nprogress, including major improvements in the quality \r\nof the lives of millions of people. Even so, it is also \r\ntrue that many societies are clearly dissatisfied with \r\ntheir current conditions. That situation creates a divide \r\nbetween citizens and their authorities, which fuels \r\nmistrust in institutions and heightens uncertainty about \r\nthe future. In Latin America, for example, the the clear \r\ndeterioration in public support for democracy revealed \r\nby the Latinobarómetro survey is extremely grave. \r\nFaced with that challenge, the world cannot fall into the \r\ntrap of demagoguery or authoritarianism.\r\nThe only viable path ahead, the only true response \r\nto a demanding citizenry, is democracy itself. The \r\nresponse must be more openness, more transparency \r\nand better accountability. As Governments, we must be \r\nable to listen to and to deal with an increasingly well-\r\ninformed citizenry that has more means at its disposal \r\nfor expressing opinions and participating in public \r\naffairs. Social networks are enabling greater public \r\nparticipation, turning each individual into a potential \r\nagent for change.\r\nIn that context, Governments must make greater \r\nefforts to better communicate with the societies they \r\nserve. Governments must communicate to publicize \r\nachievements, to recognize and explain missteps, but \r\nabove all to map out the road ahead together with their \r\nsocieties. It is essential that we promote public debate, \r\ncontrast ideas and assume shared commitments, using the \r\nnew communication technologies that are increasingly \r\navailable and accessible to the entire population. Let us \r\nrecognize in our pluralism and ongoing dialogue the \r\nideal tools for building in democracy a better future. \r\nThe response to disillusionment with democracy lies in \r\ndemocracy itself. Our Governments must foster societies \r\nthat are increasingly inclusive and participatory, where \r\nall citizens enjoy the benefits of development.\r\nGoing forward, we already have a clearly defined \r\nroad map, based on the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. These are very clear Goals for overcoming \r\npoverty and ensuring equal opportunity, gender equity, \r\nprotection of the environment and justice and peace on \r\nwhich all our countries must concentrate our efforts. \r\nMexico reaffirms its strong commitment to democratic \r\nprinciples as the only path to achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the United Mexican States for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n6/30 16-29415\r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, President of the United \r\nMexican States, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty Don Felipe VI , King of the \r\nKingdom of Spain\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the King of the \r\nKingdom of Spain.\r\nHis Majesty Don Felipe VI, King of the Kingdom of \r\nSpain, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Majesty Don Felipe \r\nVI, King of the Kingdom of Spain, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nKing Felipe (spoke in Spanish): Two years ago, I \r\naddressed the General Assembly for the first time as \r\nKing of Spain (see A/69/PV.6). I feel at present the \r\nsame honour and the same responsibility as I did on that \r\noccasion, because the United Nations is the universal \r\nforum for peace and progress for humankind, the place \r\nwhere we must secure the future of our planet.\r\nThat is how the Spanish people understand the \r\ndemands on us. Today, we cannot disappoint the \r\nbillions of people who, like Spanish society, believe \r\nin the purposes, principles and values of the 1945 San \r\nFrancisco Charter and of the 2015 Declaration on the \r\noccasion of the seventieth anniversary of the United \r\nNations that Spain helped to promote in defence of what \r\nthe United Nations represents. With that Declaration, we \r\nwanted to tell the world that the Charter was not simply \r\na beacon that lit the dark times of the past, but that it \r\nalso illuminates our present and our future. For it is the \r\nbeacon to which the children in refugee camps direct \r\ntheir eyes, as do the mothers who protect their children \r\nwhile crossing the Mediterranean — a plight which \r\ndeeply moves us. It is the hope for those who have lost \r\nloved ones owing to natural disasters or hunger, those \r\nwho defend human rights and common human dignity, \r\nand those who are persecuted as victims of terrorism in \r\nall its despicable forms. It is also the inspiration for the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, to which we \r\nhave all committed ourselves with a view to putting an \r\nend to hunger and extreme poverty and to designing a \r\nmodel for development that is sustainable in the course \r\nof a generation.\r\nFor Spain, the 2030 Agenda is a source of inspiration \r\nfor our domestic and foreign actions. We must fight \r\ninequality and work towards an economic model that \r\nfosters shared prosperity and provides employment \r\nopportunities for young people and, in general, for all \r\nthose who have suffered most from the impact of the \r\ncrisis in recent years. No one should be left behind \r\nbecause of what we do or fail to do.\r\nIn order to advance the cause that concerns us all, \r\ncombating the effects of climate change is critical. I am \r\npleased to underline that, nearly a year ago in Paris, we \r\nwere able to reach a crucial agreement in this matter. \r\nOur compliance is an unavoidable priority for us all, \r\nand one on which we will be called to account by present \r\nand future generations. The upcoming twenty-second \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, to \r\nbe held in Morocco, will offer an excellent opportunity \r\nto further strengthen our commitment.\r\nFinally, the Charter today serves as a beacon for \r\nColombia. The Spanish people welcome the peace \r\nagreement reached in that beloved country, which \r\nhas the strong support of our Government on both \r\nthe bilateral and the multilateral level. Our Congress \r\nof Deputies has unanimously supported it. Spain will \r\nstand beside the Colombian people so that they can \r\nachieve the fruits of peace for all Colombians, who \r\nwill have the last word in the plebiscite scheduled for \r\n2 October.\r\nThe European, Ibero-American and Mediterranean \r\ndimensions that constitute the identity of the Spanish \r\npeople testify to our universal vocation. We are amon \r\nthe countries that have had the greatest impact on \r\nhistory, and we are proud of our substantial contribution \r\nto the common heritage of humankind. \r\nThis year, we celebrate the 400th anniversary of \r\nthe death of Cervantes, a universally acknowledged \r\nliterary genius, who was able to convey his belief \r\nthat portraying a noble and generous spirit is the \r\nbest way to live in the world. For us, the children of \r\nCervantes, knowing how to live means, above all else, \r\nknowing how to live with others. When we coexist in \r\na democratic framework that safeguards our hard-won \r\nrights and freedoms, together with our respect for our \r\ndiversity, that is when we give the best of ourselves \r\nand contribute in more and better ways to the peace, \r\nsecurity and prosperity of the international community, \r\nas we will continue to do.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 7/30\r\nAll advanced democracies, such as ours, go through \r\ndifficult times at some point in their history. But they \r\ncome through them thanks to the strength and unity \r\nof their societies, the robustness of their institutions \r\nand the effectiveness of their system of freedoms, \r\nand thanks to the firm belief that differences must be \r\nresolved in accordance with rules that have been laid \r\ndown. In recent decades, the Spanish people have, \r\nwith a constructive spirit, demonstrated that they have \r\nembraced the values of dialogue, commitment, sense of \r\nduty and solidarity. Those are the values that transform \r\nnations into models for freedom around the world and \r\npromote the progress and well-being of their citizens.\r\nSpaniards have always come through difficult \r\ntimes, even after being hit by a severe global economic \r\ncrisis, during which our society showed an enormous \r\ncapacity to overcome adversity. We must continue \r\nto drive and reinforce the recovery on a firm, broad-\r\nbased foundation, as well as to safeguard and improve \r\nthe welfare state and a model of genuinely sustainable \r\ngrowth, diversifying our foreign presence and, above \r\nall, giving special attention to those who have suffered \r\nmost and who continue to suffer the repercussions of \r\nthe recession.\r\nThe Kingdom of Spain’s membership in the Security \r\nCouncil during the 2015-2016 biennium shows that our \r\ncountry is shouldering its responsibilities, meeting its \r\ncommitments and participating constructively in the \r\nquest for solutions to the problems we face today, such \r\nas the large movements of people that are a shocking \r\nsign of our times and are being given special attention \r\nduring a week of ministerial meetings. Spain is on the \r\nhomestretch of its mandate in the Security Council \r\nand is working with determination, accountability and \r\ntransparency, guided by the desire to make acceptable \r\nand effective commitments to prevent conflicts and \r\nresolve existing ones We have spearheaded efforts \r\nin the humanitarian field and are encouraging the \r\nincreased participation of women in both conflict \r\nprevention and peacebuilding, thereby combating gross \r\nviolations and abuses of their freedom and dignity. In \r\nthe immediate future and within the framework of an \r\nopen and inclusive process, we will seek the adoption \r\nof a resolution to prevent non-State actors and terrorists \r\nfrom having access to weapons — especially those with \r\nmass destruction capabilities that increase their ability \r\nto carry out assaults or attacks. We will also attempt \r\nto move forward international judicial cooperation \r\nagainst terrorism and step up measures against sexual \r\nviolence in conflict.\r\nDuring this period in the Security Council, we have \r\nfaced crises every day that stir our conscience and about \r\nwhich, despite much frustration, we refuse to become \r\napathetic. Five and a half years of conflict in Syria have \r\nled to the death of more than 300,000 people, brought \r\nabout the forced disappearance of more than half of \r\nSyria’s people and divided the country, leaving it at \r\nserious risk of irreversible fragmentation. The stability \r\nof the entire region has been threatened, especially \r\nthat of neighbouring nations, whose generosity in \r\nhosting Syrian refugees should be acknowledged. We \r\nregret the breach of the ceasefire agreement, and we \r\nexpress our sympathy for the victims, especially those \r\nwho were humanitarian workers. We hope and call for \r\nanother cessation of hostilities. In that context, Spain \r\nis working to improve humanitarian assistance. There \r\nis no military solution to the conflict, and the political \r\nsolution must preserve the unity of the country in an \r\ninclusive, democratic framework.\r\nIraq suffers the ravages of terrorism at the hands \r\nof Da’esh, which is already retreating thanks to the \r\nperseverance of the Iraqi Government and the support \r\nof an international coalition, of which Spain is a \r\nmember. I reiterate our full support for the Government \r\nof Iraq in its efforts to build a democratic country in \r\nwhich members of all religious faiths and ethnicities \r\ncan coexist and where human rights and the principle of \r\nterritorial integrity are respected. Moreover, we are not \r\ngiving up on any other seemingly deadlocked situation, \r\nwhether in Yemen, Libya or Afghanistan.\r\nSpain supports United Nations efforts for a just, \r\nlasting and mutually acceptable political solution that \r\nwould allow for the self-determination of the people of \r\nWestern Sahara on terms compatible with the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. In \r\nApril, the Security Council renewed the mandate of the \r\nUnited Nations Mission for the Referendum in Western \r\nSahara for one year. In that regard, Spain welcomes the \r\nrestoration of the Mission’s capabilities, in line with \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2285 (2016). We encourage \r\nthe parties to resume their dialogue with a view to \r\nfinally resolving that dispute.\r\nSpain has consolidated its relations with the \r\nAfrican continent, whose strength and dynamism \r\nwe commend and to which we are giving special and \r\npreferential treatment. We are following with concern \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n8/30 16-29415\r\nthe developments in the conflicts in South Sudan, Mali, \r\nSomalia and the Central African Republic. Spanish \r\nmilitary operations have been deployed in those \r\nthree countries in the framework of European Union \r\noperations, as well as in the various United Nations \r\nmissions throughout the world. \r\nIn mentioning them here, I wish to pay tribute to \r\nall the Blue Helmets who are working to achieve peace \r\nin those missions, sometimes at the cost of their lives. \r\nHere, it would be only right to acknowledge the work of \r\nthe African Union and subregional organizations that \r\nalso make an extraordinary contribution to maintaining \r\npeace on the continent — an achievement in which \r\nSpain will continue to play an active part.\r\nOn a map of the world where shadows abound, \r\nhope also exists. Spain welcomed the agreement on the \r\nIranian nuclear programme and also commends Iran’s \r\nverification of compliance with the conditions to end \r\nthe sanctions regime and open the door to a new trade \r\nregime with fixed restrictions. Our country is engaging \r\nin rigorous coordination efforts to assess trade requests.\r\nFew pieces of news would be more encouraging \r\nthan the announcement of the resumption of peace \r\ntalks between Israel and Palestine. Spain supports the \r\nholding of an international conference to help encourage \r\nthe negotiating parties in the course of this year, which \r\nmarks 25 years since the Madrid Conference. The two-\r\nState solution, with mutually agreed upon and secure \r\nborders, is the only way to achieve a fair and lasting \r\npeace. Denial and confrontation between communities \r\nmust lead the way to peaceful coexistence. In that \r\ncontext, Spain will promote initiatives to encourage \r\nharmony among the civil societies of both parties.\r\nTwo and a half years ago, on our continent, \r\nUkraine’s sovereignty, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity were violated. The European Union, Ukraine \r\nand Russia must be able to steer a course that will benefit \r\nus all in terms of European security and prosperity, on \r\nterms that respect the principles of international law \r\nand the values  of democracy.\r\nWe follow with great concern the serious and \r\nrepeated violations of the non-proliferation regime \r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. We \r\ncall on them to focus their efforts on a genuine search \r\nfor a climate of understanding and dialogue with the \r\ninternational community.\r\nAs for the European Union, the great project of \r\ncoexistence is now at a major crossroads. As Jean \r\nMonnet indicated, the European project is not a given; \r\nit is something we have to create every day, on the \r\nbasis of a community of both interests and people. The \r\nEuropean Union is an act of resolve, of trust in the \r\nability of our peoples to overcome past mistakes and \r\nnot repeat them. Its sustainability and strengthening \r\nare key to peace and prosperity on our continent and \r\nare enormously positive factors, both as an example \r\nand because of the deployment of capabilitities that can \r\nbenefit the United Nations as a whole. No one would \r\ngain if it were to become paralysed or fail.\r\nWe Spaniards are proud of belonging to the \r\nEuropean Union, from which we have obtained \r\nundeniable benefits and to which we have made \r\nimportant contributions, including a number of \r\nsacrifices when these were necessary for the common \r\ngood of Europe. In the current circumstances, we are \r\nready to continue in the vanguard of the European \r\nUnion’s growth in all areas.\r\nAs Spain has always done from this rostrum, let \r\nme say that Gibraltar is the only remaining colony \r\nin Europe. In compliance with the United Nations \r\nmandate, I invite the United Kingdom to put an end \r\nthat anachronism by an agreed solution between our \r\ntwo countries that restores the territorial integrity of \r\nSpain and benefits the population of the colony and the \r\nGibraltar region.\r\nThis year is the last in the mandate of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon. I would like to thank him on \r\nbehalf of Spain for his outstanding service and to \r\nexpress my personal gratitude and appreciation. Spain \r\nwelcomes the criteria of transparency and participation \r\nthat are to guide us in selecting his successor. I trust \r\nthat we will be able to make the best possible choice.\r\nSpain is a candidate for the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the 2018-2020 period. I ask for the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s support for its candidature. The \r\npromotion and defence of human rights are a hallmark \r\nof our foreign policy. We are particularly committed to \r\npromoting gender equality, the right to drinking water \r\nand sanitation, the rights of people with disabilities and \r\nthe fight against racism, xenophobia and hate crimes.\r\nThe United Nations has in Spain a Member that is \r\ncommitted to the values embodied in this Organization. \r\nWe know that they rely on us to deal with the main \r\nchallenges of today. We do this in the spirit of Don \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 9/30\r\nQuixote and the loyalty of Sancho Panza. As our \r\nuniversal classic tells us, “everyone is the architect of \r\nhis own fortune”. We Spaniards want to be the architects \r\nof a United Nations where fairness, happiness, the \r\nattainment of human rights and respect for human \r\ndignity will prevail at all times.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nKing of the Kingdom of Spain for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nHis Majesty Don Felipe VI, King of the Kingdom \r\nof Spain, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Zambia.\r\nMr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Edgar \r\nChagwa Lungu, President of the Republic of Zambia, \r\nand to invite him to address the General Assembly.\r\nPresident Lungu: It is indeed a great honour and \r\nprivilege for me to address the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session. May I join others in \r\ncongratulating Mr. Thomson on his election to preside \r\nover the deliberations of this session. I am confident \r\nthat, under his able leadership, the General Assembly \r\nwill successfully address the pressing issues on its \r\ncurrent agenda. I am also confident that he will steer \r\nthe Organization in the right direction and that we will \r\nhave fruitful discussions on the well-considered theme \r\nof this session, entitled “The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals: a universal push to transform our world”.\r\nAllow me to also convey my appreciation to \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, who will be concluding his mandate \r\nas Secretary-General this year. Through his leadership, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon has distinguished himself as a world \r\nleader committed to tackling key global challenges, \r\nsuch as reducing poverty and addressing climate \r\nchange. He has been instrumental in ushering in the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, the successor of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals. He has distinguished \r\nhimself as a global leader, focused on fairness and \r\njustice for all nations. Therefore, as he winds up his \r\nonerous responsibility as Secretary-General, I would \r\nlike to convey to him, on behalf of the Zambian people, \r\nour best wishes in his future endeavours. Well done. \r\nAnd we thank him once more for his great efforts to \r\nimprove the lot of humankind.\r\nWe are meeting during a special period, when our \r\ncountries are embarking upon the implementation of the \r\ncurrent global development blueprint, the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. Africa appreciates the \r\nimportant synergies of the 2030 Agenda and our own \r\nAfrica Union Agenda 2063 — the Africa We Want, \r\nwhich was adopted by the African Union Heads of \r\nState and Government at the African Union Summit in \r\nJanuary 2015. This convergence is a clear demonstration \r\nthat our continental aspirations and those of the broader \r\ninternational community are well aligned in terms of \r\nachieving a better world for all global citizens.\r\nMy Government accords the highest priority \r\nto the achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, and we believe that there can be no meaningful \r\ndevelopment without the elimination of poverty. In that \r\ncontext, special attention should be focused on the least \r\ndeveloped countries. They are more vulnerable and \r\nneed more support to strengthen their economies in \r\norder to overcome the challenges they face.\r\nIn our quest to address the issues of poverty, \r\nunemployment, hunger and income inequality, Zambia \r\nhas taken specific measures aimed at promoting \r\neconomic transformation. Those measures include, \r\nbut are not limited to, the development of value-chain \r\nclusters, the diversification of the agriculture sector, \r\nthe promotion of forestry and the establishment of \r\nmulti-facility economic zones and industrial parks. \r\nWe are strongly resolved to promote industrialization \r\nthrough the agriculture and manufacturing sectors in \r\norder to speed up the diversification of the economy \r\naway from an over-dependency on mining.\r\nIn that regard, my Government is addressing the \r\nchallenges faced by micro-, small and medium-sized \r\nenterprises, such as access to finance, markets and \r\ntechnology and the enhancement of entrepreneurial \r\nskills. These deliberate interventions are expected to \r\nspur enterprise growth and job creation. The renewed \r\nfocus on economic diversification is expected to further \r\ntransform our country from dependency on primary \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n10/30 16-29415\r\nproducts to the development of value-added products \r\nthrough industrialization.\r\nIn our quest to foster economic growth, my \r\nGovernment has developed its seventh five-year \r\nnational development plan, which will take effect in \r\nJanuary 2017. The plan focuses on enhancing productive \r\ncapacities in the agriculture sector and promoting rural \r\ndevelopment, which will improve the livelihoods and \r\nwell-being of rural communities.\r\nLike most developing nations, Zambia is today \r\nfaced with the challenges of population growth, and \r\nin particular the need to harness the demographic \r\ndividend. There is a mismatch between the growth in \r\nthe youth population and their assimilation into the \r\njob market. That is why the Zambian Government is \r\nimplementing necessary policies focused on skills \r\ndevelopment, entrepreneurship, education and \r\ninfrastructure development. Zambia is ready to learn \r\nfrom, and share with, other countries best practices \r\nto address the challenges faced by our young people. \r\nIt is therefore critical that youth remain actively \r\nengaged in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nThe development of appropriate infrastructure \r\nis cardinal in fulfilling Africa’s desire to accelerate \r\neconomic growth and in enhancing the continent’s \r\ncompetitiveness on the global market. Africa must \r\nexpand intra-African trade and bolster its productive \r\ncapacities. In line with this, Zambia has embarked \r\nupon infrastructure development, including the \r\nconstruction and rehabilitation of roads, railways, \r\nbridges and airports.\r\nAs the current Chair of the Group of Landlocked \r\nDeveloping Countries, I wish to reiterate our call for \r\nthe international community to remain committed to \r\nthe guidelines of the Vienna Programme of Action for \r\nLandlocked Developing Countries for the Decade 2014-\r\n2024, which aims to improve the living conditions of \r\nthe half a billion people who live in the 32 landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nIt is evident that climate change has had an adverse \r\nimpact on the growth of our economies. Zambia has \r\nbeen negatively affected by climate change, which has \r\nled to poor crop yields as a result of adverse weather \r\npatterns. We have suffered energy deficits as a result of \r\nlow water levels in our hydropower dams, which account \r\nfor more than 98 per cent of our power production. We \r\nare therefore pursuing a greater energy mix through \r\ninvestment in alternative sources of energy, such as \r\nsolar, wind and geothermal, among others.\r\nI also wish to join other countries that are calling \r\nfor the provision of adequate resources to make fully \r\noperational the Green Climate Fund, as that would \r\ngreatly contribute to climate-change mitigation and \r\nadaptation. Zambia applauds the landmark Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. It calls for fulfilment \r\nof the pledges made by parties at the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change .\r\nZambia also recognizes the importance of food \r\nsecurity, and it therefore reaffirms its commitment to \r\nprioritizing a range of agricultural practices, including \r\nappropriate technologies that respond to climate change, \r\nsuch as conservation agriculture for sustainable and \r\nincreased food production. Zambia supports calls for \r\nimproved access to global and local agro-food markets, \r\nincluding transparent and open trading systems, as long \r\nas they do not negatively impact on local production. We \r\ntherefore invite more investments in agro-processing \r\nindustries to add value to our products and increase \r\nemployment opportunities.\r\nZambia is making major strides in addressing \r\nvarious challenges in the health sector. We want to ensure \r\neasy access to health services by all our citizens. We are \r\nmaking steady progress in addressing communicable \r\ndiseases such as HIV and AIDS, tuberculosis and \r\nmalaria. We are decentralizing primary health-care \r\nservices and improving the financing mechanisms for \r\nmajor communicable diseases to strengthen the health \r\nsystems.\r\nAt the regional level, the strengthening of the \r\nSouthern African Development Community Strategy \r\non Pooled Procurement of Essential Medicines and \r\nHealth Commodities is among the positive interventions \r\nthat are contributing to our improved health systems. \r\nCurrent interventions in relation to HIV and AIDS \r\ninclude the prevention of mother-to-child transmission \r\nand the treatment of all children who are HIV-positive. \r\nOur overall goal is to reach a zero-infection rate, in line \r\nwith the global HIV and AIDS aspirations.\r\nThe Zambian Government has put in place policy \r\nmeasures to ensure that our people have access to sexual \r\nand reproductive health-care services, including family \r\nplanning. In addition, my Government has increased \r\nthe number of health centres, in both rural and urban \r\nareas, where these services are accessed.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 11/30\r\nZambia has made efforts to strengthen the legal \r\nframework for gender equity and equality by enacting \r\nthe Gender Equity and Equality Act of 2015. That \r\nprogressive law has put into effect domestically \r\nthe Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of \r\nDiscrimination against Women, the Protocol to the \r\nAfrican Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights on the \r\nRights of Women in Africa, and the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community Protocol on Gender and \r\nDevelopment. At the continental level, in 2016 Zambia \r\nwas among 11 countries presented with a gender award \r\nfor the promotion of gender economic rights. In 2015, I \r\nwas also humbled to receive the title of promoter of the \r\nHe for She campaign from UN-Women in recognition \r\nof the role that Zambia has played in the area of \r\nwomen’s empowerment.\r\nThis exemplifies the special attention and efforts \r\nthat Zambia has continued to devote to issues related \r\nto the empowerment of women and young people in \r\norder to promote inclusive and sustainable growth. \r\nThe measures that my Government has taken include \r\npromoting women’s participation in commerce, \r\ntrade and industry. In order to address some of the \r\nchallenges that women face, we need support for the \r\ncreation of lines of credit for women’s empowerment \r\nprogrammes, skills development, employment creation, \r\npoverty reduction, and technical assistance in fostering \r\nenvironmentally friendly agricultural methods.\r\nAfrica needs strong institutions, not necessarily \r\nstrong men. In that regard, Zambia is endeavouring to \r\nbuild a peaceful, just and inclusive society, particularly \r\nby consolidating democracy. The importance of \r\ndemocracy in our societies cannot be overemphasized. \r\nIt is an extremely important aspect of our political \r\nsystems that empowers people to freely participate in \r\ngovernance. As the Assembly is aware, Zambia held \r\nelections on 11 August, and they did indeed represent \r\nanother opportunity for Zambia to demonstrate its \r\ncommitment to upholding and promoting the tenets \r\nof democracy. I would therefore like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank the international community for \r\nsupporting us during the process. Equally, I would like \r\nto thank the Zambian people for their peaceful conduct \r\nduring the elections. I want to assure the Assembly \r\nthat my Government will use its mandate to continue \r\nprotecting our peaceful democratic legacy and meeting \r\nthe aspirations of our people.\r\nMy Government yearns for a community of nations \r\nthat recognizes and respects the sovereign equality of \r\nall nations, in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. As States Members of the United Nations, we \r\nall have positive roles to play in promoting peace and \r\nsecurity in order to attain sustainable development for \r\npresent and future generations. However, Zambia is \r\nconcerned about the fact that the world today continues \r\nto witness unbridled acts of conflict and terrorism and \r\nrising levels of poverty, which remain overarching \r\nand pressing challenges to our aspirations. We must \r\ntherefore eradicate conflict if we are to attain the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nZambia, as a member of the African Union Peace \r\nand Security Council, will dedicate its three-year term \r\non that important decision-making body to promoting \r\npeace and security on the African continent. I therefore \r\nreiterate Zmbia’s continued commitment to the ongoing \r\nefforts for peace and conflict resolution of the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community, the International \r\nConference on the Great Lakes Region and the African \r\nUnion. We believe that the solution to African problems \r\nlies in Africa finding its own solutions. We nonetheless \r\nwelcome and express our gratitude to the international \r\ncommunity for its continued support to conflict \r\nresolution and peace processes on the continent.\r\nWhile Zambia believes that the United Nations \r\nshould be at the core of global governance and \r\nefforts to meet the challenges of collective peace, \r\nsecurity and development, there is a pressing need \r\nto reform the Organization so that it can reflect the \r\ncontemporary realities of today’s global order. Zambia \r\ntherefore fully supports the Ezulwini Consensus \r\nand the Sirte Declaration, representing the African \r\ncommon position on reform of the Security Council. \r\nIt is not right that Africa remains the only continent \r\nwithout permanent representation on the Security \r\nCouncil. That historical injustice must be corrected. \r\nWe therefore urge Member States, including those that \r\nhave vested interests in maintaining the status quo, \r\nto give due consideration to this legitimate demand \r\nfrom Africa. We all have an obligation to make the \r\nSecurity Council more representative, democratic and \r\naccountable if the Organization is going to demand \r\ndemocracy, representation and accountability from its \r\nMember States.\r\nZambia’s belief in the ideals and role of the Security \r\nCouncil remains unshaken, and it is in that regard that \r\nI reiterate our steadfast commitment to continuing \r\nto contribute to the operations and well-being of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n12/30 16-29415\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Zambia for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Edgar Chagwa Lungu, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zambia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, President of the \r\nRepublic of Panama, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Juan \r\nCarlos Varela Rodríguez, President of the Republic of \r\nPanama, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Varela Rodríguez (spoke in Spanish): \r\nOn behalf of the people of Panama, to whom I send \r\na warm embrace from this rostrum, I am pleased \r\nto participate in the general debate of the General \r\nAssembly in order to share my thoughts on the progress \r\nand challenges that lie ahead for my country, the region \r\nand the world as they work to ensure peace, welfare and \r\nprosperity for our peoples.\r\nI would like to begin by recognizing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his outstanding work at the United Nations \r\nover the past 10 years, in which we have achieved \r\nhistoric agreements aimed at benefiting both present \r\nand future generations of humankind.\r\nPanama is a country of dialogue and discussion, \r\na multi-ethnic, multicultural, peace-loving nation, \r\nwhere people from all over the world who have found \r\na new home on our land live and cooperate peacefully. \r\nOur motto — “Panama, bridge of the world, heart of \r\nthe universe” — is growing ever stronger, and we are \r\nmaking progress under a Government committed to the \r\ndemocratic system, called to fulfil the role that stems \r\nfrom our geographical position.\r\nToday I am pleased to inform the Assembly that on \r\n26 June, we succeeded in completing the expansion of \r\nthe Panama Canal, through which more than 120 New \r\nPanamax ships, capable of carrying cargoes three times \r\nlarger than previously, have already travelled. The \r\nexpansion, which was done mainly with Panamanian \r\nlabour, has filled our nation with rightful pride and joy. \r\nWith that major step, we Panamanians have fulfilled \r\nour commitment to continuing to bring the world closer \r\ntogether, facilitate global trade and put our country at \r\nthe service of the international community. With the \r\nexpansion finished, we are now preparing to move \r\nforward with studies that will enable us to increase \r\nthe water-retention capacity of the Canal watershed in \r\norder to ensure a sufficient supply of drinking water \r\nto our major cities and uninterrupted operation of the \r\ninter-oceanic route. I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto invite the international community to visit our \r\ncountry and appreciate this masterpiece of engineering.\r\nIn Panama, we are working for political reform \r\nthat gives democracy stability by making sure that it \r\nis always based on service to others. Thanks to the \r\ncontributions of the expanded Canal, and of an honest \r\nGovernment committed to transparency and the efficient \r\nmanagement of public funds, Panama is maintaining its \r\neconomic growth and making rapid progress towards \r\nmeeting the 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\r\nOur Government’s 2014-2019 strategic plan \r\nis aligned with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and backed by an aggressive public \r\ninvestment plan, totalling $19 billion, designed to \r\nprovide all Panamanians with access to potable water, \r\nbasic sanitation, decent housing and efficient, high-\r\nquality health, education, security and transport \r\nservices. With the aim of eradicating poverty and \r\ninequality, we have strengthened and expanded the \r\ncoverage of our social support system programmes, \r\nwhich now reach 20 per cent of the population. In the \r\narea of public health, we have completed the first phase \r\nof our national dialogue for effective coordination of the \r\nhealth system. We have conducted mass vaccinations \r\nfollowing an outbreak of the H1N1 virus in the region, \r\nand through our first national census on preventive \r\nhealth we have done free clinical evaluations of more \r\nthan 80,000 people over the age of 40.\r\nAs a country, we are making the biggest investment \r\nin basic sanitation and mass transit in Latin America, \r\nareas that account for about 60 per cent of our budget \r\nfor 2019. Together with our social housing and training \r\nprogrammes for young people at risk, those projects \r\nare transforming our neighbourhoods and communities \r\nwith a new model for human development, with a \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 13/30\r\nvision by the State taking into account social criteria \r\nand without partisan political distinctions. In the area \r\nof education, in a strategic alliance with the private \r\nsector, we are allocating the funds needed to develop \r\nan educational model with 100 per cent high school \r\nattendance, an extended school day and bilingual \r\neducation, alongside the construction of new, modern \r\nhigher technical education institutes that can enable our \r\nyoung people to get the well-paid jobs that our growing \r\nservice economy is generating.\r\nWith the support of more than $3 billion in foreign \r\ninvestment in the energy sector, we are diversifying our \r\nenergy mix with renewable, cleaner types of energy. \r\nWe have set ourselves the goal of recovering 50 per \r\ncent of our deforested areas in the next 20 years and \r\nprotecting our biodiversity and our oceans. By 2019, we \r\nwill have built more than 300,000 basic sanitation units \r\nin Panamanian homes and housing projects for more \r\nthan 100,000 families nationwide. We are building \r\n10,000 new classrooms and renovating more than 3,000 \r\npublic schools across the country. Right now we are \r\nmaking progress in adding another 50 kilometres to \r\nour mass transit metro system, which will benefit more \r\nthan 1.5 million people. Our plan also includes long-\r\nterm planning for the construction of new hospitals, \r\nroads, water treatment plants, aqueducts and sewage \r\nand wastewater treatment plants. All these efforts in \r\npublic investments are being implemented with full \r\nfiscal responsibility, an added value of an honest and \r\ntransparent Government.\r\nIn addition, we have developed a set of major \r\nreforms and exemplary actions aimed at strengthening \r\nour democracy and ensuring transparency and \r\naccountability within a framework of respect for the \r\nseparation of powers and the rule of law. With every \r\npassing day, our country comes closer to meeting the \r\nSDGs. The range of world-class international services \r\nthat form the basis of our growing economy makes us \r\never more committed to being responsible citizens of \r\nthe world. As a serious, responsible country, Panama is \r\nwilling to comply with the obligations of international \r\nlaw and to cooperate as a regional partner and strategic \r\nally on trade and security issues.\r\nWith the same determination with which we \r\ncommitted to completing the expansion of the Canal \r\nand protecting our logistical services, ports and \r\nairports from organized crime, we in Panama have \r\naccepted responsibility for upholding our financial \r\nsystem and moving forward with the exchange of \r\ntax information. Our Administration has enacted \r\nimportant legal and institutional reforms so that we can \r\nadopt top international standards in order to comply \r\nwith the recommendations of the Financial Action Task \r\nForce on preventing and combating money laundering, \r\nterrorist financing and related activities. As I told \r\nthe Assembly last year (see A/70/PV.19), some weeks \r\nago we reaffirmed our commitment to transparent \r\nfinancial systems and fiscal responsibility with our \r\nannouncement that Panama will become party to the \r\nConvention on Mutual Administrative Assistance \r\nin Tax Matters of the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development, and we are going to do \r\nthat. We will continue to work with the international \r\ncommunity to lead efforts to prevent financial systems \r\nfrom being used for purposes that do not represent the \r\ncommon good.\r\nIn addressing the serious threats and major \r\nchallenges that are the purview of the Assembly, we \r\nmust not forget that relations among States are global. \r\nTherefore we cannot allow differences of opinion \r\namong two or more countries on a single topic to \r\njeopardize the progress that can be achieved on other \r\nbilateral and multilateral issues of common interest and \r\nmutual benefit to our peoples.\r\nThe world witnessed significant progress made at \r\nthe Paris summit. This week, Panama will deposit the \r\ninstrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on \r\nclimate change. Our country is moving aggressively to \r\nplay its part. With the same resolve and commitment, \r\nI call on States Members of the Organization to join \r\nforces against climate change, pool their efforts and \r\ndo everything in their power to find comprehensive \r\nsolutions to the issue of irregular migration f lows, and \r\nto continue taking solid steps that will allow us to defeat \r\nterrorism and organized crime, inequality and poverty.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed the intensification \r\nof terrorist attacks that threaten the peace and security \r\nof humankind on a recurring basis. I wish to recognize \r\nthe men and women fighting terrorism and to express \r\nour solidarity with the families of those killed in these \r\nattacks. I thank those who are deployed on humanitarian \r\nmissions around the world, assisting those who flee \r\nviolence caused by terrorism and armed conflict.\r\nPanama energetically condemns the recent attack \r\nperpetrated against a humanitarian aid convoy in Syria. \r\nI take this opportunity to call on the great Powers to \r\nmaintain their diplomatic channels open and pursue \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n14/30 16-29415\r\ndialogue within the framework of the Security Council \r\nin order to achieve peace in Syria and the cessation of \r\nother armed conflicts in the world.\r\nYesterday, we Heads of State had the opportunity \r\nto discuss in depth the issue of irregular migration \r\nf lows in our region, which in our case principally \r\ninvolves Haitian citizens who risk and even lose their \r\nlives crossing vast distances, rivers and inaccessible \r\nterritories en route to northern countries in the hope of \r\na better future. We stress our position that all migration \r\npolicies and measures must be based on the protection \r\nof the inherent human right to life. Convinced that \r\ncontrolled migration contributes to justice and \r\nequity in the world, Panama therefore reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to providing humanitarian treatment for \r\nmigrants, applying strict health and safety controls. I \r\ncall on all countries of the hemisphere to endorse the \r\nsuccessful completion of the electoral process in Haiti \r\nand the strengthening of its democratic institutions \r\nand economy.\r\nThe rapprochement between the Governments \r\nof Cuba and the United States is an example of what \r\ndiplomacy can achieve in order to contribute to the \r\nregulation of migration f lows, and we expect this new \r\ndimension of the foreign policies of both countries to \r\ncontinue developing until the normalization of full \r\ndiplomatic relations is achieved.\r\nPanama supports the dialogue that is taking place \r\nin Venezuela. We believe that the inclusion of the \r\nHoly See as a mediator of the process would be very \r\npositive, and we reiterate our position that any end to \r\ntensions between the political forces of that brotherly \r\nnation must be achieved through democratic means \r\nand dialogue in order for social peace and respect for \r\nhuman rights to prevail.\r\nOn 26 September, we shall accompany the \r\nGovernment of Colombia in the signing of the Final \r\nPeace Agreement in that brotherly nation, which we \r\ncommend and fully support. Our presence at that historic \r\nevent will not be only to support the Agreement, but \r\nalso to honour the memory of thousands of members \r\nof the Colombian public forces who have died and the \r\nthousands of innocent lives lost throughout the conflict.\r\nWe congratulate the Government of Colombia \r\nand President Juan Manuel Santos Calderón for his \r\ndetermination in the pursuit of peace, and we call on \r\nthe demobilizing rebel groups to fulfil their obligations, \r\nas laid out in the Agreement, in order to consolidate a \r\npeace that is so desired and deserved by the Colombian \r\nnation. In this context, I acknowledge the Secretariat for \r\nits decision to become actively involved in supporting \r\nthe peace process through to its successful completion.\r\nDespite this great step forward, the region \r\nis threatened by increased drug production and \r\ntrafficking. Panama will therefore continue to \r\nstrengthen its capabilities and professionalize its public \r\nforces in order to protect our homeland and support \r\nthe countries of our continent in the front-line fight \r\nagainst drug trafficking. During the 27 months of our \r\nGovernment, we have achieved a significant reduction \r\nin crime of more than 40 per cent after having launched \r\na successful security plan to prevent and combat crime \r\nin Panama, offering more opportunities for young \r\npeople at risk and a firm hand against delinquency \r\nand organized crime. In accordance with our security \r\nstrategy, we have managed to seize tons of drugs and \r\ndismantle networks linked to organized crime.\r\nIn the first years of our Government, we reached out \r\nto the countries of Asia. With the support of Singapore, \r\nwe are developing higher technical education in our \r\ncountry, and through the technical assistance and \r\nfinancing of the Government of Japan, Panama will \r\nbuild a 27-kilometer monorail that will benefit hundreds \r\nof thousands of Panamanians in the west of our capital \r\ncity. With Europe, we increased our air connectivity \r\nwith direct f lights to five cities on that continent. With \r\nthe United States, we have strengthened cooperation in \r\nsecurity, and with the countries of our Latin American \r\nregion we have adopted migration and trade policies \r\nthat contribute to the development of economic relations \r\nand encourage integration.\r\nTwo months ago, the Holy See and His Holiness \r\nPope Francis acknowledged our country’s commitment \r\nto playing an active role in strengthening unity and \r\npeace in the world and guiding young people so that they \r\nmay continue advancing along the path of education, \r\nwork and progress. Panama has been chosen to host the \r\nnext World Youth Day in 2019. This event will bring \r\ntogether more than 500,000 young people from 190 \r\ncountries and will be a great opportunity to sow the \r\nseed of peace among young people in Central America, \r\nexchanging violence, mourning and pain for peace, \r\nfaith and hope. This will promote and consolidate \r\nfamily values, security and the common good.\r\nIn the globalized world in which we live, threatened \r\nby armed conflict, terrorism, organized crime and \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 15/30\r\nhumanitarian crises, responsible countries represented \r\nin the Assembly must unite to confront these global \r\nthreats and strengthen the United Nations system. Our \r\ncanal has expanded, as have our ports and airports. \r\nIn this way, Panama is each day more prepared to be \r\nthe great connection. Yet what is most important for \r\nme as President is that the Government I lead should \r\nprepare us in such a way that this connection is \r\nmore than merely logistical, and encompasses values \r\nand principles that strengthen governability in all \r\nnations and guarantee social peace in the world.  My \r\nGovernment is committed to its country and to its \r\npeople, and my nation is committed to placing its riches, \r\ncapabilities and geographical position at the service of \r\nall the world’s inhabitants. This is Panama — the route \r\nthat unites the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Panama for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Carlos Varela Rodríguez, President of \r\nthe Republic of Panama, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Costa Rica\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Costa Rica.\r\nMr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Luis \r\nGuillermo Solís Rivera, President of the Republic of \r\nCosta Rica, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Solís Rivera (spoke in Spanish): Costa \r\nRica congratulates Mr. Thomson on his election as leader \r\nof the General Assembly and welcomes the priorities \r\nthat he has set for his term of office. The President can \r\ncount on our full support for their implementation. \r\nCosta Rica also thanks the Secretary-General for his \r\nleadership and, in particular, his contribution to the \r\ncause of peace and sustainable development.\r\nWe are coming to the end of 2016, having achieved \r\nlittle progress in addressing the crisis of refugees and \r\nmigrants — the worst such crisis since the Second World \r\nWar. Costa Rica reiterates the urgency of providing \r\nassistance and the need to ensure the protection of and \r\nrespect for the human rights of people who have been \r\nforced to leave their homes in search of safe havens \r\nfor themselves and their families, as a result of armed \r\nconflict, violence, natural disasters or the effects of \r\nclimate change that threaten their access to the most \r\nbasic means of survival. We are failing to fulfil our \r\ncommitment to leave no one behind.\r\nMass media and the international community \r\nhave paid little attention to the tragedy of thousands of \r\nmigrants travelling through Latin America from south \r\nto north. For Costa Rica, from April to September alone \r\n9,487 irregular migrants have crossed our borders, and \r\nwe have granted refugee status to a total of 215 people \r\nduring the first half of 2016 alone. Our country has \r\nbeen a crossroads for thousands of migrants: Cubans, \r\nHaitians, Central Americans, Asians and Africans.\r\nClearly, the problem is global and requires \r\njoint solutions, solidarity, shared responsibility and \r\ncomprehensive approaches. With regard to migration \r\nand refugee crises, we must not consider only large \r\nmovements, as these only deal with very specific \r\nexperiences, and leave out any discussion on the \r\nconstant f low of migration throughout the rest of \r\nthe world. Such movement takes place outside of the \r\nconfines of the law. It is a phenomenon that is fuelled by \r\ninequality, poverty and structural causes resulting from \r\nconflict and is fostered by the activities of international \r\norganized crime networks.\r\nAs a country of origin, transit and destination for \r\nmigrants, Costa Rica has criminalized their trafficking \r\nunder the law against trafficking in persons and \r\nsmuggling of migrants adopted in 2012. That legal \r\nframework also guides the design and implementation \r\nof our national policy to address the crime of migrant \r\nsmuggling from a gender perspective. The policy is \r\nbased on the care and protection of victims, prevention, \r\nlaw enforcement, information gathering, analysis and \r\nresearch, and institutional coordination.\r\nIn our experience, faced with f lows of migrants \r\nand the need for humanitarian aid, we must highlight \r\nthe ongoing role played by civil society organizations \r\nas a support network for migrants and their families \r\non the move, in addition to their enormous capacity to \r\ndocument the situation on the ground and see to and deal \r\nwith violations of human rights of smuggled migrants. \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n16/30 16-29415\r\nCommunities that have welcomed these migrants have \r\nshown their profound solidarity with those in need. \r\nThe complex situation concerning the wave of \r\nmigrants will only be exacerbated by the effects of \r\nclimate change. Floods, droughts and the rise in sea \r\nlevel will force people to pick up and move within their \r\ncountry and abroad.\r\nSuch challenges call on us to virtuously manage \r\nthe entire ecosystem of human mobility through \r\na dialogue on processes, actors, mechanisms and \r\norganizations. Resources must be efficiently used, \r\nand there must be better coordination between \r\nhumanitarian and development actors. That does not \r\nmean that development resources must be redirected to \r\nhumanitarian assistance. That would create a vicious \r\ncircle, thereby neglecting investment in the root causes \r\nof such movements.\r\nWe will not tire of repeating and insisting on the \r\nneed to address the specific impacts that migration \r\nhas on women and the need to adapt public policies to \r\naddress those particularities. We will continue to raise \r\nour voice to call for action to combat gender-based and \r\nsexual violence.\r\nIf we are feigning loyalty to laws and institutions, \r\nwe had better stop. If we believe that humankind can \r\nsurvive by remaining on this path and adhering to \r\npretences as usual, we will only be selfishly and short-\r\nsightedly digging our own grave. We should remember \r\nthat it is not because of mere altruism but the starkest \r\nrealities that we have chosen to abide by a global order, \r\nsubject to institutions and universal principles of self-\r\nregulation. The escalation of tensions, conflicts and \r\nthe use of force suit no one but a few merchants of \r\nsuffering and death. The national interest of all States \r\nis to strengthen the international system and the United \r\nNations, which is at the centre of that effort.\r\nThe philosopher and Nobel Peace Prize laureate \r\nAlbert Schweitzer said,\r\n“To the question whether I am a pessimist or an \r\noptimist, I answer that my knowledge is pessimistic, \r\nbut my willing and hoping are optimistic”.\r\nToday there are realities and actions that fill me with \r\noptimism because change is taking place in the world. \r\nI wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ninvitation to be co-facilitator, along with my colleague \r\nSimona Scarpaleggia, Chief Executive Officer of IKEA \r\nSwitzerland, of the High-Level Panel on Women’s \r\nEconomic Empowerment. The hard work of the Panel \r\nhas already resulted constructively in a preliminary \r\nreport. I want to share several of its conclusions with \r\nthe Assembly. \r\n       Simona Scarpaleggia said at the Panel,\r\n“I firmly believe that there is huge potential \r\nthat could be unlocked simply by valuing and \r\nempowering women. The energy, the power and \r\ncreativity of women are badly needed — not only \r\nto make this world a better place, but to enable it to \r\nsurvive in the years to come.”\r\nThe lessons are many, but first it is necessary to \r\nrecall some facts, some of which might seem obvious and \r\nothers that might surprise. The vast majority of women \r\nin the world work. They work in the informal, public and \r\nprivate sectors as business women, domestic workers, \r\nand unremunerated workers. But women have half as \r\nmany possibilities as men in securing full-time paid \r\nwork. It is estimated that there are 1.27 billion women \r\nworldwide in paid jobs compared with 2 billion men. We \r\nare talking about a difference of more than 700 million \r\nwomen who do not have the same opportunities as men. \r\nWomen undertake unpaid work three times as often as \r\nmen and handle most of the caregiving work. The deep \r\nand unfortunate impact of this situation is reflected in \r\nthe fact that it is estimated that the value of unpaid care \r\nwork is equivalent to $10 billion, or 13 per cent of world \r\ngross domestic product.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are \r\ninterconnected and interdependent. The Panel \r\nemphasized the multiple relationships that exist \r\nbetween the targets set out in Goal 5, on gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women, and Goal 8, \r\nto promote inclusive and sustainable economic growth, \r\nemployment and decent work for all, men and women \r\nalike. The relationship between this debate and Goal \r\n10 is clear: the goal is to reduce inequality within and \r\namong countries. I am convinced that the economic \r\nempowerment of women should be viewed not only as \r\na goal in itself but as a means for the implementation of \r\nthe other targets and Goals set out in the 2030 Agenda.\r\nThe Panel proposes seven principles and seven \r\nguiding actions. As basic principles, we assume that no \r\nwoman should be left behind and that nothing should \r\nbe done for women without the participation of women, \r\nand that we should focus equally on rights and profits. \r\nEmpowerment is not only the right thing to do; it is \r\nthe intelligent road map towards human development, \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 17/30\r\ngrowth and business promotion. We must also address \r\nthe root causes of economic gender inequality based on \r\ngender inequalities in society, respect internationally \r\nagreed standards, and, finally, recognize the need \r\nto work in partnerships, with global compliance in \r\nall countries.\r\nTo achieve the global empowerment of women, the \r\nPanel recommends the following measures.\r\nFirst, we must end stereotypes and transform and \r\nchallenge the rules that limit women’s access to work \r\nor devalue their work. Changing those rules must \r\nbe a priority in order to expand women’s economic \r\nopportunities within the framework of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nWe must level the playing field for women, \r\nguarantee employment and social protection, and \r\nreform discriminatory laws and regulations. A total \r\nof 155 countries worldwide have at least one law that \r\nprevents women from becoming involved in economic \r\nactivities. This must be changed; it would contribute \r\ngreatly to economic growth, and it is a simple step that \r\nall Governments can take.\r\nFinally, as a social co-responsibility, we must invest \r\nin care, recognizing, reducing and redistributing unpaid \r\nwork in this field. We must ensure decent working \r\nconditions for domestic workers. One of the first \r\nsteps to achieve this is to ratify International Labour \r\nOrganization (ILO) Convention No. 189. I urge those \r\ncountries that have not yet done so to take that step.\r\nWe must guarantee the an adequate distribution \r\nof digital, financial and physical goods. This is also \r\nimportant. We need Governments, the private sector \r\nand civil society to take action so as to ensure that \r\ntrends and innovations in digital technologies and \r\nfinance, as well as legal reforms in the field of tenancy \r\nand land ownership, expand women’s opportunities.\r\nWe must change our culture and the way we do \r\nbusiness in order to create opportunities for women. As \r\na minimum, businesses should follow ILO conventions \r\nalong with national legislation regarding gender \r\nequality in order to eliminate discriminatory practices.\r\nWe must create opportunities, with Governments \r\nimproving practices in the public sector both as an \r\nemployer and as a supplier of goods and services. We \r\nmust establish, implement and promote public policies \r\nthat benefit women living in poverty and vulnerability \r\nas well as macroeconomic policies that guarantee their \r\nrights and generate sustainable and inclusive work.\r\nWomen’s voices must be heard, encouraging a \r\ngreater participation in leadership and business and \r\npolitical decision-making posts. In order to translate \r\nsuch measures into reality, it is imperative that we \r\nimprove data collection relating to the economic \r\nempowerment of women. The ILO, along with many \r\nother United Nations agencies, development banks and \r\nvarious countries and organizations, has been making \r\nconsiderable efforts to create new methodologies and \r\nmeasurements with respect to the widest variety of \r\nvariables pertaining to the economic empowerment \r\nof women.\r\nThe Heads of State and Government who are \r\nlistening today should know that the most important \r\naspect of the work of the Panel, which is scheduled to \r\nissue a second report next year, relates to everything \r\nthat we are able to accomplish in our own countries \r\nas a result of its findings, good practices, principles \r\nand recommendations. We invite those States capable \r\nof implementing the Panel’s recommendations to do \r\nso and to become laboratories instrumental in their \r\nimplementation. A call to action is imperative. There \r\nmust be greater commitment on the part of all to achieve \r\nthis objective.\r\nWe know that the world has many crises to deal \r\nwith, but we can and must promote and ensure changes \r\nthat will transform the lives of millions of women and \r\ngirls. This is an imperative call to action. I am certain \r\nthat this will benefit not only women, but also our \r\nsocieties at large. This is a step we must take in order \r\nto achieve equality in other aspects of relationships \r\nbetween men and women. This is the best path for our \r\nplanet; together, humankind can effectively adopt new \r\nmodels of sustainable development that allow us to \r\nsurvive as a species.\r\nIt fills us with immense pride that the Paris \r\nAgreement negotiations were led by a Costa Rican \r\nwoman, Christiana Figueres, Executive Secretary of \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange until early July, a woman with immense \r\ndiplomatic capabilities who showed us that when we \r\nwork together, with commitment and a focus on the \r\ncommon good, we can restore hope and work towards \r\na better world.\r\nThe Paris Agreement must enter into force \r\nimmediately, and we have an obligation to increase \r\nour ambitions with time. That is why Costa Rica has \r\nmade every effort to complete its domestic approval \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n18/30 16-29415\r\nprocess and will soon join the list of countries that have \r\nratified it.\r\nWe therefore aspire to become a laboratory for \r\nthe deep decarbonization of the world economy and \r\na green hub for management, innovation and the \r\ntransfer of knowledge, with early action built upon \r\nexisting achievements. With our planned nationally \r\ndetermined contribution, we will work to achieve \r\nour national aspiration to steer the economy towards \r\ncarbon neutrality by 2021, as part and parcel of pre-\r\n2020 voluntary actions, and we have strengthened our \r\nlong-term commitment to the deep decarbonization of \r\nthe economy. The compensatory effects of our forests \r\nare accompanied by emissions reductions in critical \r\nsectors such as transport, livestock and waste. We \r\nhave set an absolute emissions limit for 2030, which \r\nis equivalent to a 25 per cent reduction in emissions \r\ncompared with 2012.\r\nOur aspirations also include the promotion of our \r\nsocial inclusion and development policies so that our \r\nfocus can go beyond the traditional silo-based approach. \r\nWe are moving towards an integral development \r\nmodel based on multidimensional benchmarks that \r\ngo far beyond the entry requirement. For that reason, \r\non 9 September the heads of the three State branches \r\nand representatives of local governments, the private \r\nsector, social and religious organizations and academia \r\ngathered to sign the national pact to meet the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nOur planet needs our care, and this care must be \r\nall-encompassing. Costa Rica is fully committed to \r\nprocesses that, within the framework of the United \r\nNations, seek to protect oceans and marine resources, \r\nin particular through the elaboration of a new \r\ninternational agreement for the protection of the more \r\nthan 60 per cent of marine biodiversity that is located \r\nin international areas, in keeping with Goal 14 of the \r\n2030 Agenda.\r\nCosta Rica continues to be deeply shocked by the \r\nterrorist attacks that, unfortunately, as we know, occur \r\nsomewhere in the world practically every week of the \r\nyear. We would like once again to express our absolute, \r\nunequivocal condemnation of terrorism in every all its \r\nforms and manifestations, no matter who commits it \r\nor where it happens or with whatever goal in mind, as \r\nwell as to stress the need to bring to justice those who \r\ncommit such acts. \r\nThe fight against terrorism must be framed in \r\nstrict observance of international law, including human \r\nrights law, international humanitarian law and the \r\ninternational law on refugees. In that context, we think \r\nthat this is the right time to make a respectful request \r\nto countries that have not yet done so to ratify the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty without further delay. The diversion of \r\narms to extremist groups could be substantially reduced \r\nif more States were to implement the provisions set \r\nforth in that multilateral, legally binding instrument.\r\nCosta Rica has followed with concern the constant \r\nlaunches of missiles and the carrying out of nuclear \r\nexercises by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nthe most recent one being on 9 September. In addition \r\nto voicing our strongest condemnation and rejection of \r\nsuch actions, which represent a serious threat to peace, \r\nstability and regional and international security, we \r\nmust demand that North Korea cease such punishable \r\nacts, which unequivocally violate relevant resolutions \r\nof the Security Council, including the most recent one \r\non the subject, resolution 2270 (2016).\r\nCosta Rica also wishes to stress the importance of \r\nfighting impunity for criminal atrocities. Prosecution \r\nfor such crimes must be promoted comprehensively and \r\nat the highest level. Costa Rica welcomes the initiatives \r\naimed at promoting a code of conduct restricting the \r\nuse of the veto in the Security Council in cases of \r\noutrageous crimes. Costa Rica reiterates its call to \r\nMember States to adopt the code of conduct put forth \r\nby the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\nGroup.\r\nLikewise, Costa Rica welcomes the efforts oriented \r\ntowards the full establishment of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween the United States of America and Cuba, as well \r\nas the measures announced by the senior authorities \r\nof those two friendly countries concerning political \r\ndialogue and openness. In that spirit, we reiterate our \r\nsupport for the lifting of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade against Cuba in accordance \r\nwith the systematic, almost unanimous, demands of the \r\ninternational community to that end.\r\nCosta Rica welcomes the signing of the peace \r\nagreements in Colombia and the ceasefire declaration of \r\nlast August. Not only does that bring an end to the oldest \r\narmed conflict in the region, but it also contributes to \r\nwholly converting Latin America and the Caribbean \r\ninto a region of peace. We trust that the agreement will \r\nallow the Government and our Colombian brothers \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 19/30\r\nand sisters to plan their future development along a \r\npeaceful path.\r\nWe would like to stress that it is the General \r\nAssembly that has the power to define the term of office \r\nof the next Secretary-General through the appointment \r\nresolution. We will continue to advocate that the term be \r\na single period of seven years without the possibility of \r\nre-election, as we are convinced that that would facilitate \r\nthe exercise of leadership free from the coordination \r\nrequired to set in motion a selection process designed \r\nto secure a second term. It is fundamental to Costa Rica \r\nthat there be a democratization of the selection process \r\nfor the Secretary-General. Therefore, the Security \r\nCouncil’s endorsement of more than one candidate \r\nincreases the inclusiveness, transparency and, most \r\nimportant, the legitimacy of the process by requiring \r\na vote.\r\nWe have advocated, and will continue to advocate, \r\nthat a woman should occupy the position of Secretary-\r\nGeneral for the first time in history. We have reached \r\na new milestone in history by having six extraordinary \r\nwomen, including a Costa Rican, as candidates for \r\nthe position of Secretary-General. The transformation \r\ndemanded by people all over the world requires new \r\nsensibilities and forms of exercising leadership.\r\nMy goal is that my daughter Inés, who is 10 years \r\nold now, will be able to tell her descendants of a strange \r\nformer era, when women did not earn as much as men \r\nfor the same work, when they were not equal owners \r\nof the means of production, when the care of children \r\nwas a chore largely reserved for women and when their \r\nsexual and reproductive rights were not safeguarded. \r\nThat strange era is the one that we must leave behind, \r\nin the same way that we slowly leave behind other \r\nscourges such as slavery, discrimination in any of its \r\nmany forms, and consumption and wars as the basis for \r\nour economy, which are destroying our shared home, \r\nMother Earth.\r\nWe can overcome hate, violence and inequality. We \r\ncan achieve peace. We can trace the path to development \r\nand human progress. We just need to believe that it is \r\npossible, and that making it happen is in our hands.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Costa Rica for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, President of the \r\nRepublic of Costa Rica, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Tsakhia Elbegdorj, \r\nPresident of Mongolia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nof Mongolia.\r\nMr. Tsakhia Elbegdorj, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Tsakhia Elbegdorj, President of Mongolia, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Elbegdorj: At the outset, I wish to join \r\nothers in extending our heartfelt congratulations to the \r\nPresident on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. Mongolia pledges \r\nits full support to the President.\r\nIt is my great honour to address this body for the \r\nseventh time on behalf of the Mongolian people. I am \r\nthe youngest of eight sons. For generations, my family \r\nlived as nomadic herdsmen in the western highlands of \r\nmy country. My mother and father never dreamed that, \r\none day, their youngest son would be speaking from this \r\nrespected rostrum to the largest assembly in the world.\r\nI am proud to serve for my country in accordance \r\nwith the free will of our people. Mongolia is governed \r\nby democratic rules. The President has a constitutional \r\nterm limit. Therefore, my mandate ends next year. This \r\nis my last address as the President of Mongolia to the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nBut the people of Mongolia will continue to be \r\ncitizens of the global community together with all \r\nnations. I am proud that my country is a good friend and \r\npartner of every State Member of the United Nations. I \r\nam confident that our next President will be welcomed \r\nby everyone here and will be given the same respect \r\nand the same spirit of cooperation that I have enjoyed \r\nduring these years.\r\nAchieving sustainable development is essential. It \r\nis essential because no one in the world should be left \r\nbehind and be deprived of the right to development. We \r\nmust work together towards a world where everybody \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n20/30 16-29415\r\ncan have a dignified life, free from poverty, violence \r\nand depression. I firmly believe that justice, stability \r\nand security cannot be ensured without the rule of law \r\nand respect for the fundamental rights and freedoms \r\nof all. Those basic principles must be respected and \r\nprotected in every country and by all Governments.\r\nThe United Nations celebrated its seventieth \r\nanniversary at a time of turbulence. Today, we are \r\nwitnessing many conflicts and terrorist attacks, \r\nwhich have become almost daily news headlines. The \r\nworld is facing its largest-ever humanitarian crisis, \r\ninvolving millions of people who have been displaced \r\nfrom their homes. The slowdown in global growth and \r\nthe rising tensions in many places have threatened \r\nfurther progress.\r\nHowever, the intervening year has been a period of \r\ninspiring collaboration as well. In some places, long-\r\nfought wars have come to an end. Peace agreements \r\nhave been reached. The development of dangerous \r\nweapons has been restrained. The power of diplomacy \r\nhas prevailed. Last year, all together, we launched the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which \r\nincludes a plan of action for people, the planet and \r\nprosperity. In December in Paris, the world turned a \r\nnew page in its efforts to combat climate change. \r\nAs a global community, we are all following a new \r\nroad map on our next 15-year journey. The 2030 Agenda \r\nand the Paris Agreement provide clear guidelines for \r\nachieving what we have promised to do. We must now \r\nact together as we take responsibility for our people. \r\nWe must now strengthen our partnership so as to save \r\nthe planet. We now need the resources to put the action \r\nplan to work.\r\nMongolia will ensure that no one is left behind \r\nby reaching out first to the most vulnerable. The \r\nprinciples and policies of the 2030 Agenda have been \r\ntranslated into our national strategy. The Mongolia \r\n2030 Sustainable Development Vision of is under way. \r\nOur agenda calls for the establishment of a diverse \r\nand inclusive economic structure aimed at increasing \r\ndecent jobs, providing opportunities and generating \r\nincome. Our goal is to improve the quality of life and \r\nensure environmental sustainability. Equally essential \r\nis cooperation between and among Governments, \r\ninternational development communities, the private \r\nsector and civil-society institutions.\r\nFrom our past experience in implementing the \r\nMillennium Development Goals at the national level, we \r\nlearned that regular follow-up and review mechanisms \r\nwill be essential to achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). Therefore, accountability \r\nand the quality of governance will eventually define the \r\nsuccess of the SDGs.\r\nTomorrow, we will mark that landmark achievement \r\non our collective journey to counter climate change. \r\nLet me take this opportunity to congratulate the States \r\nparties that have formally ratified the Paris Agreement. \r\nThe people of Mongolia have joined the world in its \r\nfight to mitigate climate change. We have concluded \r\nour national legislative process and recently ratified the \r\nParis Agreement. The Paris Agreement represents our \r\ncommon success, the result of our hard work. It is also \r\na great inspiration for all of us. It is our bold vision and \r\npromise to our children to save the world for them. And \r\nwe must deliver on that promise.\r\nMongolia is one of smallest carbon emitters in the \r\nworld, yet it suffers disproportionately from climate \r\nchange. Desertification, deforestation and the loss of \r\nbiodiversity have severely affected livelihoods in our \r\ntraditional nomadic culture, and they spur further \r\nenvironmental degradation.\r\nMongolia is holding up its end of the bargain. But \r\nthe promised international cooperation and support \r\nare still lacking. The benefits of the green funds and \r\ncarbon credits are sorely missed in Mongolia and \r\nmany developed countries alike. We urge multilateral \r\ninstitutions to take the lead in those important efforts. \r\nWe have one home, one world for all of us and one \r\nuniversal goal, namely, to save our home. Today is our \r\ntime to act. We must not miss that chance, as we must \r\nnot miss our future.\r\nTo that end we must work for equality, inclusiveness \r\nand accountability in our Governments and societies. \r\nOur agreed Agenda calls for inclusive societies and \r\naccountable institutions. People have called for good \r\ngovernance and the rule of law through the 2030 Agenda. \r\nThey have asked for transparency and accountability \r\nin Governments’ plans and development efforts. We \r\nmust be accountable in our actions and responsibilities. \r\nAccountability is a benchmark requirement for good \r\ngovernance. Good governance is key to global peace \r\nand prosperity. We therefore promote accountability \r\nand good governance in our society. A national law \r\non public hearings and a policy on supporting public \r\nparticipation are being implemented in Mongolia.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 21/30\r\nThe Agenda for Sustainable Development demands \r\naction against corruption. It requires that institutions \r\nfunction in a transparent and efficient way, based on the \r\nrule of law. Basic services must therefore be delivered \r\nwithout discrimination or corruption. Investors can \r\ncount on stability and businesses on predictability, \r\nwith clear legal frameworks, decent jobs and recourse \r\nto independent courts. It means that natural resources \r\nare harnessed to benefit the many, not the few, and the \r\nenvironmental impact is measured and controlled.\r\nDevelopment and accountability are about \r\ndemocracy. We should never take democracy for \r\ngranted. Neither should we worship it. It must be \r\nnurtured and strengthened on a daily basis. It is our way \r\nof living and our state of mind. A democratic society is \r\nsustainable because its aim is the highest development \r\nof every one of its members.\r\nTherefore, our common goal as leaders should be to \r\nprovide an environment where democratic institutions \r\ncan thrive — the rule of law, human rights, democratic \r\ngovernance and free and fair elections. And we must \r\nenforce accountability. The people will do the rest in \r\na democracy. For only in a democracy will each and \r\nevery person be provided with opportunities for self-\r\ndevelopment and self-realization.\r\nOver the past 26 years, Mongolia has accumulated \r\nexperience as a stable and peaceful democracy. It \r\nwas tested again in the most recent parliamentary \r\nelections, held on 29 June. The elections were open and \r\ntransparent. The newly formed Parliament and Cabinet \r\nare now responsible for the people of Mongolia. The \r\npeople vested them with full power to work hard \r\nfor them.\r\nOver the past two decades, Mongolia has been \r\nsupporting and promoting stronger democratic \r\ninstitutions and sustainable, effective and legitimate \r\ndemocracy. We have been sharing our experiences \r\nand lessons learned with our fellow nations. We have \r\nbeen happy to learn that our lessons have helped \r\nother countries.\r\nFrom this podium, I wish to sincerely congratulate \r\nthe people of both Kyrgyzstan and Myanmar for their \r\nsuccessful elections held last year and to wish them \r\nsustained prosperity.\r\nAs one of the Chairs of the International Institute \r\nfor Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA), \r\nMongolia hosted the IDEA Annual Democracy Forum \r\nlast month. At this year’s Forum, the focus was on \r\nlearning from democratic transitions. Experts from \r\nmany countries with various democracy models shared \r\ntheir experiences relating to improving the modalities \r\nof elections, accountability and transparency. It was \r\ntruly a knowledge-sharing and inspiring exercise. \r\nMongolia’s International Cooperation Fund, to which \r\nwe are committed, will expand its activities to work \r\ntogether with emerging democracies.\r\nMongolia holds dear human rights and liberties. \r\nThese days we talk all too often about human rights \r\nand the rule of law. Whether we uphold such values \r\nis tested by actual practice and implementation. The \r\nentire 2030 Agenda is centred on respect for human \r\nrights and human dignity. We, the Member States, have \r\nthe primary responsibility for upholding human rights. \r\nIn order to assume its responsibilities, Mongolia has \r\nstarted a new phase of legal reform aimed at ensuring \r\nthe full protection of human rights, including the right \r\nto justice.\r\nMongolia has abolished the death penalty. I believe \r\nthat the death penalty is neither acceptable nor justifiable \r\nunder any circumstances. I believe that one day our \r\nloving human family will become free of the death \r\npenalty. I know it is not easy to exercise leadership on \r\nthat tough issue. Nevertheless, as a democratic society \r\nin the East, Mongolia will spare no effort to promote \r\nhuman rights and human dignity.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, \r\nMongolia will work against any form of discrimination. \r\nTen years ago, we, the Member States, created the \r\nHuman Rights Council to put the human rights pillar \r\nback at the centre of the United Nations system. It was \r\ncreated to provide a space for open dialogue so as to \r\nrespond to human rights emergencies. As we know all \r\ntoo well, human rights are, sadly, threatened around \r\nthe world. Many countries fail to uphold human rights \r\nwhile countering terrorism. The Human Rights Council \r\nmust act effectively to create a global culture based on \r\nrespect for human rights and dignity for all.\r\nThe spread of terrorism all over the world is a grave \r\nconcern for us. Terrorism is a common challenge for all \r\nof humankind. It is a common threat to national security, \r\nas well as to the global order. We all witness, almost \r\nevery day, humanitarian disasters and massive human \r\nrights violations. Mongolia firmly opposes all forms \r\nof terrorism and violence. There is no justification for \r\nterrorism of any kind. The international community \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n22/30 16-29415\r\nmust be united to defeat and counter terrorism. At the \r\nsame time, we should also do all we can to prevent that \r\nform of violent extremism.\r\nIn July this year, Mongolia successfully hosted \r\nthe eleventh Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM) Summit to \r\ncommemorate the twentieth anniversary of that forum. \r\nI take this opportunity to express my heartfelt gratitude \r\nto the Heads of State and Government and leaders \r\nof the ASEM partner organizations for attending the \r\nSummit and contributing to its success. I am proud to \r\nreport to the General Assembly that the leaders of Asia \r\nand Europe came together to chart out the future course \r\nof action for the next decade. We reaffirmed our strong \r\ndetermination to take joint actions to consolidate peace, \r\nsecurity and stability. Asia and Europe stand united in \r\nour actions against terrorism, corruption and poverty. I \r\nfirmly believe that ASEM multilateralism will advance \r\nglobal well-being and prosperity. Once again, I thank \r\nrepresentatives for visiting my homeland for a once-in-\r\na-century event of global magnitude.\r\nIn the Ulaanbaatar Declaration, the leaders of Asia \r\nand Europe sent strong messages to the people of the \r\nworld about how we will work together during the next \r\ndecade. We are united in contributing to sustained \r\npeace, security, stability and economic recovery and \r\nin responding to global and regional challenges in the \r\ntwenty-first century. We all agreed on the key role \r\nthat the United Nations should play in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIt has always been a profound delight for me, as \r\nthe Head of State of Mongolia, to report to the General \r\nAssembly on the successful service of Mongolian sons \r\nand daughters as Blue Helmets, who stand guard for \r\nglobal peace and stability. The United Nations is doing \r\nits utmost to protect civilians, end conflicts and create \r\nconditions for lasting peace. The security environment \r\nis far more complex and more dangerous than ever, and \r\nthe services of United Nations peacekeepers have never \r\nbeen as much in demand as now.\r\nThe world is not yet free of wars, devastation and \r\ndestitution, but we believe that there will come a day \r\nwhen child refugees will no longer be swept onto the \r\nshore by cold ocean tides, when children will no longer \r\nbe orphaned in senseless violence and wars and when \r\npeople will no longer be afraid to take peaceful strolls \r\nin the beautiful cities of Nice, Istanbul or Dhaka.\r\nSouth Sudan is still the youngest member of the \r\ninternational community. The people of South Sudan \r\nneed our help and support, and we are proud that \r\nMongolian peacekeepers, together with fellow Blue \r\nHelmets, continue to extend their helping hand to the \r\npeople of South Sudan. We honour their bravery and \r\ndedication. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my profound appreciation to the thousands of \r\ncourageous members of international humanitarian \r\norganizations. They put their very lives at risk while \r\nsaving millions from certain death and starvation. \r\nOnce again, I congratulate them.\r\nThe demand for mediation and support and good \r\noffices for humanitarian assistance has reached an all-\r\ntime high. Conflict situations must be resolved. My own \r\nregion, North-East Asia, is home to many unresolved \r\nissues. The last stronghold and division of the Cold War \r\nstill persists on the Korean peninsula. Any development \r\nthere will have a direct impact on regional and our own \r\nsecurity and stability. Once again, we reiterate our firm \r\nposition that the Korean peninsula should be nuclear-\r\nweapon-free.\r\nIn order to resolve tensions and conflicts, it \r\nis crucial to eradicate mistrust among the nations \r\nconcerned and to hold direct talks more often. The \r\nUlaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian Security is \r\ncalled upon to do exactly that: to promote trust in the \r\nregion, to facilitate the exchange of ideas and to find \r\nsolutions to common concerns. The task is complicated \r\nand not easy. However, every Member of the United \r\nNations will strive for an appropriate solution.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me to express Mongolia’s full \r\ncommitment to faithfully implementing both the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. We must demonstrate \r\nto the world and to our nations that meaningful progress \r\nis being made on all 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We reaffirm our firm commitment to the \r\nmultilateral system with the United Nations at its core. \r\nLet us therefore work together for the progress on \r\nglobal development for future generations. As always, \r\nMongolia will play its part for the cause of peace, \r\nfreedom and justice.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Mongolia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tsakhia Elbegdorj, President of Mongolia, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 23/30\r\nAddress by Mr. Macky Sall, President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Senegal.\r\nMr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Macky Sall, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sall (spoke in French): The delegation \r\nof Senegal wishes to thank the former President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly for his efforts during the previous \r\nsession and wishes the current President every success \r\nin the carrying out of his mandate.\r\nWe are gathered here once again to breathe new life \r\ninto the founding principles of the United Nations, to \r\npromote peace and progress and to cultivate the spirit \r\nof tolerance and mutual understanding among peoples. \r\nNevertheless, the world has never been so violent or \r\ndangerous as it is now, as innocent people, whose only \r\nmistake was to be in the wrong place at the wrong time, \r\nare being killed without reason, leaving entire families \r\nplunged into grief and mourning. No cause, certainly \r\nno religious cause, can justify violence. The height \r\nof cowardice is attacks against priests and imams, \r\nincluding at religious sites.\r\nSenegal — a land of cultural and religious diversity, \r\nwhere the Muslim 95 per cent of the population live \r\nin harmony with their Christian fellow countrymen \r\nand people of other traditional religions — firmly \r\ncondemns and rejects violence in all of its forms and \r\nmanifestations. By the same token, we reject facile and \r\nunjust assignments of blame. Neither Islam nor Muslims \r\nare to blame for what we are witnessing. We refuse to \r\nhave the senseless acts of a faithless, lawless minority \r\nbe used as a pretext for stigmatizing more than 1 billion \r\nMuslims and their religion. When imams are killed and \r\nmosques are attacked, including acred Islamic sites, it is \r\nMuslims whose faith and very core are being attacked. \r\nWe must therefore not condemn Muslims for actions of \r\nwhich they themselves are the victims. It is high time to \r\ncease the madness and Islamophobic slurs.\r\nSenegal is concerned every time measures target \r\nMuslim countries and communities, in violation of \r\nhuman rights and the rules that govern international \r\nrelations. To lapse into senseless Islamophobia only \r\ncompounds suffering with more suffering. It stokes \r\nantagonism and exacerbates the clash of civilizations, \r\nwhich plays into the hands of extremists of all stripes. \r\nGiven the global terrorist threat affecting us all, good \r\nsense dictates the need to cooperate to vanquish evil \r\nwith a global, united and concerted response.\r\nThe values that bring us together and make each of \r\nour peoples feel like part of the United Nations family \r\nderive from the fact that all civilizations and cultures \r\nare equal in dignity. Therefore, since we are the \r\nUnited Nations, let us apply the same commitment and \r\ndiligence to tackling all of the challenges we face, from \r\nSyria to Libya, from South Sudan to Somalia, from \r\nNorthern Mali to countries plagued by the criminal \r\nactivities of the Boko Haram terrorist group. Let us \r\ngive the same priority to all threats to international \r\npeace and security.\r\nLet us finally work to arrive at a fair solution to \r\nthe protracted Israeli-Palestinian conflict, one which \r\nupholds the legitimate right of the Palestinian people \r\nto a State living side by side with Israel in peace, each \r\nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders. \r\nLet us extend the same respect and humanity to all \r\nmigrants, refugees and displaced persons, regardless of \r\ntheir origin. \r\nLet us finally rectify the historical injustice of a \r\nSecurity Council without a permanent seat for Africa, \r\nthe only continent in that situation. I would recall in \r\nthat connection that Africa accounts for nearly one \r\nthird of United Nations Members, and that issues \r\ninvolving Africa form the bulk of the work of the \r\nSecurity Council. Senegal will continue its mandate in \r\nthe Security Council. We remain wedded to the African \r\nposition, as set forth in the Ezulwini Consensus. We \r\nremain open to dialogue with those whose opinions \r\ndiffer from ours.\r\nLast year, we adopted the Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment for the period up until 2030, and we \r\nadopted the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nWith the theme of this session, which calls for a \r\nuniversal effort to transform our world, we have a \r\nfresh opportunity to translate our commitments into \r\naction. For African countries, the issue of energy \r\nremains a vital challenge, because there can be neither \r\nindustrialization nor development without access to \r\nelectricity at competitive costs. Africa cannot continue \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n24/30 16-29415\r\nto enlighten other continents with its resources, while \r\nit itself remains in the dark. Africa cannot continue \r\nto serve as a reservoir for raw materials, processed \r\nelsewhere to the detriment of its own industrialization. \r\nAfrica cannot remain the continent that is most affected \r\nby climate change, even though our contribution to \r\ncarbon dioxide emissions related to electricity is at the \r\nlowest level, expected to reach only 3 per cent in 2040.\r\nThe Paris Agreement, which we signed in April, \r\ncompels us to work together and calls for developing \r\ncountries, especially in Africa, not to adopt the same \r\npolluting patterns as industrialized countries. To that \r\nend, the African Union last July launched a support \r\nfund to provide electricity to Africa. The fund is \r\nhoused at the African Development Bank, and its aim \r\nis to mobilize financing for electricity projects as part \r\nof an energy mix. On behalf of the New Partnership for \r\nAfrica’s Development, the steering committee of which \r\nSenegal chairs, I commend the support of France and \r\nGermany for that initiative. I invite all bilateral and \r\nmultilateral partners to contribute to the financing of \r\nthe fund for providing energy to Africa, in line with \r\nthe commitments made under the Paris Agreement to \r\nfinance mitigation and adaptation measures.\r\nFurthermore, I call for a different view of \r\ndevelopment challenges in Africa. Let us set aside the \r\nclichés of a bygone past. Let us not look at Africa as \r\na land of humanitarian emergencies and a receptacle \r\nfor official development assistance, but rather as a \r\ncontinent that is being built, a centre for development \r\nand progress. Africa is a continent of roads and \r\nhighways, of bridges and railways, of dams and power \r\nplants, of industrial zones and modern agricultural \r\nfarms. That is our ambition for our countries. We \r\ncannot achieve that ambition through assistance, only \r\nthrough large-scale urgent investments in sectors that \r\ngenerate growth and development. We wish to depend \r\nmainly on the mobilization of our own resources \r\nthrough more effective public spending, greater and \r\nfairer remuneration for our raw materials, regulated \r\ntaxation and a more robust struggle against illicit \r\nfinancial f lows.\r\nIn that connection, Senegal supports the plan to \r\ncombat tax-base erosion and profit-shifting, which \r\nwas initiated by the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development and the Group of 20, \r\nwith support from the World Bank and the International \r\nMonetary Fund. At the same time, I would call for \r\nthe immediate implementation of the “Strengthening \r\nassistance for complex contract negotiations” initiative \r\nof the Group of Seven, especially in the area of mines \r\nand hydrocarbons. We wish to see fair and balanced \r\ncontracts that protect both the interests of the investor \r\nand the rights of the host country.\r\nFinally, I would call upon all public and private \r\npartners not to overestimate the investment risks in \r\nAfrica. Africa has achieved significant progress in \r\nterms of good governance and improvements in the \r\nbusiness climate. The risk there is not greater than \r\nelsewhere, and clearly, for a global economy that is \r\ncurrently suffering, Africa does not pose risks. Rather, \r\nthe continent affords opportunities for recovery and \r\nshared growth. Let us work to reform global financing \r\nso as to alleviate the conditions limiting access to credit \r\nfor development financing.\r\nBy drawing upon our faith in a new Africa, \r\nfor two years we have continued to implement the \r\nEmerging Senegal Plan through major infrastructure \r\nprojects, notably central electric-power plants, a new \r\nurban centre, transportation infrastructure, including \r\na second toll road, and the forthcoming launch of a \r\nregional express train line linking Dakar to our new \r\ninternational airport, soon to be finished.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for all his efforts and \r\nservice to the United Nations in this difficult time.\r\nI also wish to pay tribute to President Barak \r\nObama of the United States for his contribution to \r\nthe international agenda over the course of his two \r\npresidential terms. The path taken by President \r\nObama through the decision of the American people \r\nis a historic message, a universal message, a message \r\ninviting every person to overcome the shadows of their \r\nown prejudice to embrace the light of wisdom. It is a \r\nmessage of humanity that is reminiscent of the eloquent \r\nwords delivered by the Reverend Martin Luther King, \r\nJr. 53 years ago in front of the Lincoln Memorial, that \r\npeople “will not be judged by the colour of their skin, \r\nbut by the content of their character”.\r\nWhat holds true for humankind also holds true for \r\nnations. There are no large and small nations; there are \r\nunited nations. And since we are the United Nations, all \r\nvoices must count when we deliberate on our common \r\nissues. I wish the General Assembly every success in \r\nits work.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 25/30\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. John Key, Prime Minister of \r\nNew Zealand\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of New Zealand.\r\nMr. John Key, Prime Minister of New Zealand, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. John Key, Prime \r\nMinister of New Zealand, and inviting him to address \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMr. Key (New Zealand): It is special pleasure to \r\nspeak to the General Assembly under the presidency of \r\na Pacific island friend.\r\nThe world is facing serious challenges. Borders are \r\nclosing to people and products, and to investment and \r\nideas. Many States are turning inwards. The politics of \r\nfear and extremism are gaining ground. Too many States \r\nare f louting the rules. But no country can face today’s \r\nchallenges alone. Now more than ever, we need to show \r\nthat we are united in our respect for the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. They are the basic \r\nprinciples that underpin our global system, born from \r\nthe bitter experience of war, and they are as relevant \r\ntoday as they were in 1945.\r\nMy country, New Zealand, is a proudly independent, \r\nmulticultural trading nation in the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion. The international system matters to us. We are \r\ncommitted to being a good global citizen and to playing \r\nour part. We rise on the fortunes of all Member States. \r\nWe believe that it is in all our interests to be open and \r\noutward-facing, to work through our differences, to \r\nhave rules and, most of all, to play by them. Now is \r\nthe time to reinforce the relevance and standing of the \r\nUnited Nations in our response to today’s challenges.\r\nThere are many areas where the United Nations \r\ncould be more efficient, more representative, more \r\nresponsive and show greater leadership. It is our \r\ncollective responsibility as Member States to face up to \r\nthe political commitment necessary to make the United \r\nNations the body that we want it to be.\r\nFor the past two years, our focus has been on the \r\nSecurity Council. We are using our term on the Council \r\nto raise the tough issues, because we believe that that is \r\nwhat the Council is for and what our supporters expect \r\nus to do. New Zealand is working for a Security Council \r\nthat shows more leadership on the toughest political \r\nissues, that works harder to get the incentives right so \r\nas to broker solutions and that is better at responding to \r\npolitical crises before they spiral out of control.\r\nThe Council has put its weight behind many \r\nsuccesses, from the adoption of the Iran deal to ending \r\nthe long-running war in Colombia. But the Council \r\nalso has shortcomings that, if not addressed, risk \r\nundermining its relevance and standing in world affairs. \r\nFor the vast majority of Member States, which are \r\ndependent on a fair, rules-based international system, \r\na weak Council is not an option. We acknowledge that \r\nthe Council does not have a role in every crisis. But the \r\nreality is that we need the Council to respond when no \r\none else can. That is why we have consistently called for \r\nCouncil action to revive the Middle East peace process.\r\nWe have also been deeply troubled to see the \r\nCouncil, the pre-eminent body for international peace \r\nand security, fail to live up to its responsibilities on \r\nthe most serious crisis of our time — Syria. There the \r\nCouncil has fallen short. The internal politics within \r\nthe Council and the sheer complexity of the Syrian \r\ncrisis have obstructed a unified Council response. But \r\nwe believe that no matter how difficult and sensitive \r\nthe issues, the Council cannot watch the situation go \r\nfrom bad to worse for the Syrian people. The Security \r\nCouncil was established to address crises such as \r\nthat which we see in Syria. That is why New Zealand \r\nis using our presidency of the Council to convene a \r\nleaders’ level meeting tomorrow on Syria.\r\nA meeting by itself will not stop the conflict. \r\nBut after more than five years of brutal fighting and \r\nhorrific humanitarian suffering, we do not think that \r\nit is credible for leaders to come to New York and not \r\naddress the stark realities driving the conflict. We hope \r\nthat tomorrow’s meeting will provide an opportunity for \r\nCouncil leaders to take stock of developments, examine \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n26/30 16-29415\r\nthe fundamental issues at the heart of the conflict and \r\ndiscuss how we can move towards a sustainable political \r\nsolution.\r\nWe also hope that the meeting will be a chance \r\nfor the Council to put its weight behind the ceasefire \r\nagreement reached between the United States and \r\nRussia. That agreement is the best chance we have had \r\nin some time to stop the fighting, get aid to those who \r\nneed it and get back on track for a political resolution \r\nto the crisis.\r\nAnother critical issue on which New Zealand \r\nsupports unified Council action is the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. New Zealand believes \r\nthat a strong international response is required to \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear \r\ntest on 9 September and its recent missile tests. The \r\nregime’s efforts to advance its nuclear and missile \r\nprogrammes, its callous disregard for the North Korean \r\npeople, as demonstrated by the human rights situation \r\nin the country, and its leader’s unpredictably ruthless \r\nrule have made it one of our most pressing international \r\nsecurity threats. Its provocative actions show blatant \r\ndisregard for Security Council resolutions and pose \r\na grave threat to international law. They have raised \r\ntensions on the Korean peninsula to a point where the \r\nrisk of conflict is dangerously high. We cannot afford \r\nfurther escalation.\r\nNew Zealand therefore welcomes recent steps by \r\nthe United States and China to begin negotiating a new \r\nSecurity Council resolution, following the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s recent nuclear test. We \r\nhope that this will send a clear signal to the North \r\nKorean leadership that continued provocative and \r\ndangerous actions are unacceptable and that a return \r\nto the negotiating table represents the only sensible \r\nway forward. The international community must \r\nstand together in conveying these messages, including \r\nthrough fully implementing Security Council sanctions.\r\nThe Council has impact and influence when \r\nit is unified, but we have to get better at identifying \r\nincentives that encourage unified Council positions. For \r\na country with a proud tradition of being a pragmatic \r\nbridge-builder and problem-solver, the Council can \r\nbe an incredibly frustrating place to work. But we are \r\ncommitted to trying to make it work because it is in our \r\ncollective interest to have a strong and relevant Council.\r\nWe all need to make an investment in keeping it \r\non track where it is needed most: in preventing and \r\nstopping conflict. That means coming to the Council \r\nready to find a way to get beyond vested political \r\ninterests and being prepared to work on compromise \r\nsolutions that stop the fighting.\r\nThe veto plays a huge part in the Council’s \r\neffectiveness. No matter how hard we work to find \r\ncompromises, time and time again we come up against \r\nthe veto. The use of the veto, the threat of the veto, \r\nthe exploitation of the veto is well beyond what the \r\nfounders of the United Nations ever envisaged.\r\nWe acknowledge that addressing regional and \r\nnational interests is a fundamental part of the process of \r\nfinding durable solutions. But increasingly the Charter \r\nis being ignored and the Council seen as irrelevant as \r\ncountries put pursuit of their national interests before \r\nalmost anything else. The time for moving forward on \r\nSecurity Council reform is now. We will be pushing \r\nmore than ever for action in the General Assembly \r\nto make the Council better reflect today’s realities \r\nand needs.\r\nNew Zealand is also working to make the Council \r\nmore effective in conflict prevention. We want to make \r\nthe Council better at responding to political crises before \r\nthey spiral out of control. There is no lack of mandate \r\nfor conflict prevention. It is in the Charter. There is \r\nno lack of information about escalating situations. \r\nWe see the evidence of this, often in the most heart-\r\nbreaking images in the media. The problem is that we \r\ndo not always have the will, and we do not use the tools \r\navailable to us.\r\nMany States block action, asserting sovereignty \r\nand ignoring the rest of the Charter. Others do not \r\nwant to spend the money. Most have bilateral or \r\nnational interests. And leaders of countries in political \r\ncrisis often do not want their actions to be on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda.\r\nBut we cannot ignore the growing gap between \r\nthe humanitarian costs of picking up the pieces after \r\nconflict and the amount that the United Nations \r\nallocates to prevent conflict. The shortfall is growing \r\nat an unsustainable rate, while the peace operations \r\nbudget is increasing year on year.\r\nBut this is not about money. It is about saving lives. \r\nThat is why New Zealand is trying to get the Council \r\nworking more closely with regional organizations and \r\ngetting the Council to be more willing to engage at an \r\nearlier point with countries in crisis. This is a focus of \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 27/30\r\nour presidency, and it will continue to be a focus of our \r\nwork when we come off the Council.\r\nBeyond the Security Council, parts of the United \r\nNations system are stepping up. There have been \r\nsignificant steps forward on development, climate, \r\nfinancing, humanitarian issues and disaster risk \r\nreduction. These issues are of significant importance \r\nto our closest development partners, small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nFor economic development to be fully realized, the \r\nSustainable Development Goals must be implemented \r\nby all. But developments here in the United Nations do \r\nnot exist in a vacuum, apart from the global economy \r\nand trading system. Sustainable economic development \r\nis a key driver of global growth, prosperity and, most \r\nof all, stability. This requires a fair, rules-based trading \r\nsystem, more open trade and the removal of trade \r\nbarriers.\r\nThe multilateral trading system has been a critical \r\nfactor in this respect. Last year, we welcomed an \r\nagreement by the World Trade Organization (WTO) \r\nto eliminate agricultural export subsidies. This was \r\nthe first legally binding international trade outcome in \r\nagriculture since 1994. This matters for development \r\nand will make a real difference for rural communities.\r\nBut the types of challenges that the United Nations \r\nfaces are similar to those that have hindered more \r\nprogress in the WTO in recent years. New Zealand \r\nbelieves that the WTO needs to do more to set global \r\ntrade rules. We need it to find common ground that \r\novercomes vested national interests and agree to \r\nnew international trade commitments that benefit \r\nall countries.\r\nIn the Asia-Pacific region, closer economic \r\nintegration through trade agreements such as \r\nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Regional \r\nComprehensive Economic Partnership will also bring \r\nus closer together. Agreements like these will make our \r\nregion and people better off by setting the conditions \r\nfor more open and transparent trade. A more prosperous \r\nand integrated region will also be a more secure one, \r\nand that is in all of our interests.\r\nWe must guard against creeping protectionism \r\nand be willing to make the case for more economic \r\nengagement clearly. We cannot turn inward. We \r\ncannot allow fear or narrow domestic interests to turn \r\nus away from an open global trading system that has \r\nlifted millions out of poverty. Countries that close \r\ntheir borders cannot and do not do business. History \r\nhas shown that this does not work for our countries. \r\nIt will not help our peoples, and protectionism will \r\nhave a chilling effect on our ability to deliver on the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nA decision of critical importance to the future of \r\nthe United Nations will be made in the coming weeks. \r\nIn April, I was very pleased to nominate former New \r\nZealand Prime Minister Helen Clark to be the first \r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General from the Pacific.\r\nThis is not the time for a business-as-usual appointment \r\nof a Secretary-General. We need someone who is up \r\nto the job. The next Secretary-General must have the \r\ncourage, experience and skills necessary to lead this \r\nOrganisation, to keep it relevant and responsive. I have \r\nworked across the political divide from Helen Clark for \r\nyears, and I know her to be a natural leader. She rallies \r\npeople together to find common ground, even when the \r\nissues are difficult and the differences vast. She gets \r\nthings done. We think it is time for a Secretary-General \r\nlike Helen Clark.\r\nI am proud of the contribution that New Zealand \r\nis making to the Security Council, but I am keenly \r\naware of the Council’s limitations. It is the General \r\nAssembly that now needs to act to make the United \r\nNations stronger and more relevant to the world. New \r\nZealand is committed to the principles and values of the \r\nUnited Nations. We will keep working hard for those \r\nprinciples, because we believe that they are vital for a \r\nsafer, more prosperous future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of New Zealand for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. John Key, Prime Minister of New Zealand, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Matteo Renzi, President of the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of the Republic of Italy\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Council of Ministers of the Republic of Italy.\r\nMr. Matteo Renzi, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n28/30 16-29415\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Matteo \r\nRenzi, President of the Council of Ministers of the \r\nRepublic of Italy, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Renzi (Italy) (spoke in Italian; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): As we approach the close \r\nof this day, I feel the responsibility to refer from this \r\nrostrum to the statement addressed to all of us by the \r\nPresident of the United States, Barack Obama (see \r\nA/71/PV.8). In summarizing the past eight years of \r\nhis presidency and his relationship with the United \r\nNations, he highlighted how the international context \r\ntoday is riven by a deep division between the world of \r\nfear and the world of courage, between the world of \r\nresentment and the world of hope, and between anger \r\nand opportunity.\r\nA new season is therefore beginning, one filled \r\nwith opportunities and possibilities, but also with \r\nunprecedented threats and difficulties that, until a \r\nshort while ago, had seemed in all likelihood to be \r\nvery remote. Foremost among them is the threat of \r\nterrorism to our cities, to everyday life. Terrorism no \r\nlonger strikes only conventional targets, but rather the \r\nhuman dimension: a theatre, a restaurant, a museum, \r\na stadium. Also pressing are the risks connected with \r\npandemics, which are sometimes exaggerated but \r\nvery often constitute grave risks, as well as the risks \r\nconnected to the environment, to which this community \r\nof women and men, together with my colleagues, was \r\nable to give a response by signing the important Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change this past April.\r\nBut there are also risks linked with other events \r\nthat combine to make the future seem more a time of \r\nconcern than of hope, from risks connected to natural \r\ndisasters — one of which Italy experienced a few weeks \r\nago in Amatrice, Cumuli and Arquata  — to the great \r\nquestions concerning migration and the worries that \r\nthat phenomenon instils in the hearts of people, the \r\nquestions it raises and the difficulties it presents. The \r\nfuture has therefore become more and more a place of \r\ndoubt, of fear. Yet we need to choose the road of hope, \r\nthe road of possibility, the road of opportunity.\r\nThe problems are not in fact theoretical problems \r\nthat need to be tackled by an assembly of experts. These \r\nproblems have a face: it is the face of Omran, the Syrian \r\nboy, shell-shocked, covered in blood, looking with his \r\nbig eyes not so much at the photographer’s lens as at \r\nthe hearts of each one of us; it is the eyes of Nadia, the \r\nYazidi girl whom I met yesterday, who escaped from the \r\nviolence of Da’esh and is today a courageous witness in \r\na battle on behalf of human rights, of women’s rights, \r\nof freedom.\r\nThey are challenges and threats for which borders \r\nno longer exist. They are in the hearts of our cities and \r\nsometimes on the outskirts of European cities, which \r\nhave often forgotten the true sense of threats inside our \r\nborders rather than outside them. Every reference to \r\nwhat happened between Paris and Brussels is deliberate.\r\nI therefore wondered, in conveying the greetings \r\nof Italy, which voice from Rome I should bring to those \r\nissues. It would be nice, of course, to share with the \r\nAssembly the words of hope and also of pride that \r\ncharacterize the concrete acts of saving hundreds of \r\nthousands of human lives from the Mediterranean — lives \r\notherwise condemned by desperation — by the Italian \r\nwomen and men wearing the uniform of the Navy or the \r\nCoast Guard.\r\nIt would be nice to bring to each member of the \r\nGeneral Assembly the pride and the voice of the \r\nItalians who work in the fields of culture, education \r\nand research; of Italians who, together with other \r\nEuropeans, are leading the European mission that \r\nin a few weeks will see for the first time a European \r\nspacecraft land on Mars, on 19 October, in exactly one \r\nmonth — a sign of the research that is making Europe \r\nnot only a place of technocrats and bureaucrats, but also \r\na place looking toward the future.\r\nYet I would like to propose a different, even \r\nprovocative image. The image of Rome that I would like \r\nto propose is that of Aeneas. Aeneas is the man of the \r\njourney. Mythology is filled with examples of people \r\nwho set out on journeys. Some set out on a journey to \r\nreturn home, like Odysseus. And some, like Aeneas, \r\nchose to journey to create a new city, a new civilization. \r\nAeneas sets out on a journey carrying on his \r\nshoulders his ailing father. It is a sign of a generation \r\nthat is not afraid to assume its responsibilities and \r\nthat believes that the experience of the elderly is still \r\nan absolute value and will go so far as to bear on its \r\nshoulders the added burden of history. Aeneas is the \r\nman who ensures for his son, Ascanius, the possibility \r\nof going on to live and to found the great history of \r\nRome. But Aeneas is the man who, in the foundation \r\nmyth, is the bearer of pietas, the sense of profound \r\nrespect, halfway between the religious value and \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.10\r\n16-29415 29/30\r\nthe profound sense of cultural identity that makes \r\na community worthy of being called a community. \r\nWithout pietas, without compassion for others, there is \r\nno room for community. And this is why, to my mind, \r\nit is essential that we tackle the challenge launched this \r\nmorning from this rostrum by Barack Obama with the \r\ngreat value of pietas and the building of communities to \r\nwhich the myth of Aeneas refers.\r\nThis is how Italy will tackle the challenges of 2017: \r\nby participating in the Security Council, a responsibility \r\nthat it will share with the Netherlands. It will participate \r\nin the Council, which will see a new Secretary-General, \r\nwith the assumption of responsibility and the conviction \r\nthat the Sustainable Development Goals, the challenges \r\nassociated with environmental and technological \r\nsustainability and the building of an ever-stronger \r\ncommunity will ref lect the values that have made our \r\nhistory great. In 2017 Italy will participate in the life of \r\nthe international community by hosting, on 25 March, \r\nthe States members of the European Union for the \r\nsixtieth anniversary of the signing of the European \r\nTreaty, with the goal of making of Europe not merely an \r\nevocation of history but rather a new chapter in a book \r\nto be written with increased ideals, dreams, horizons \r\nand vision, not with a tiring and repetitive day-by-day \r\nlisting of bureaucratic rules and decisions.\r\nItaly will lead the work of the Group of Seven (G-\r\n7), which will meet at a splendid site in Sicily — that \r\nland of great culture and great values — by the Greek \r\ntheatre in Taormina, facing Mount Etna with the \r\nMediterranean Sea before it bathing the shores of that \r\nextraordinary region. The agenda will focus on the \r\nactions that we have been discussing today: increasing \r\nour contributions to development cooperation and \r\ninvestments in education. For we must not forget that, \r\nif the terrorist problem has its origins in theatres of \r\nwar, there is also a terrorist problem originating in \r\nthe abandoned outskirts of our cities, and the only \r\nweapon that can counter such terrorism is an enormous \r\ninvestment in education and human capital.\r\nWe are very proud that the Italian Government \r\nhas adopted a law, with the support of representatives \r\nof Parliament, that stipulates that for every euro \r\ninvested in security, policing, cybertechnology and \r\ncybersecurity, one euro must be invested in culture, \r\neducation, recreation, preschool education, theatres \r\nand other venues that nurture the spirit and the soul, \r\nbecause that is another way to fight the crisis of our era.\r\nWe will ensure that the meeting of the G-7 serves \r\nas an important occasion to reflect on the values of \r\nidentity and culture, as well as the challenge of food \r\nin the double sense of the fight against poverty and \r\nstarvation, on the one hand, and the value of food \r\nsecurity and health awareness, on the other. At the \r\nsame time, we are convinced that the challenge facing \r\nthe Security Council, the challenge facing Europe and \r\nthe challenge facing the G-7 share the same root, based \r\non the same blueprint.\r\nIt is our duty as Italians to bring our voice and \r\nour contribution to the United Nations in seeking and \r\nidentifying ancient values with a new inflection. Today, \r\nthe pietas of Aeneas has become an opportunity to build \r\na new world based on hope and not on resentment, hatred \r\nor anger. Our people, our men and women, continue \r\nto work to serve the ideals of peace. They include our \r\nwomen and men in diplomacy and politics, and the \r\nwomen and men who serve our country by wearing a \r\nuniform in Afghanistan and in Somalia, by protecting \r\nthe Mosul Dam in an area fundamental to the future \r\nof our planet, and by serving in the Balkans as well, \r\nin particular in Serbia. They are security professionals \r\nwith additional features, namely, the priority they place \r\non humanity.\r\nThe women and men who make us proud to be \r\na part of the Italian heritage know that we have not \r\noriginated from nothing, but rather from the tradition \r\nto which I have referred, one that finds its highest \r\nexpression represented by the Mediterranean Sea. \r\nThe Mediterranean is the sea that the Romans called \r\nMare Nostrum — our sea. It is the sea where today \r\nhundreds and thousands of people seek refuge as they \r\nf lee from war, from hunger and from poverty. The \r\nresponsibility for that part of the world has become our \r\never-growing burden.\r\nIn comparison, while we can say that progress \r\nhas been made in Libya since last year, too little has \r\nbeen accomplished by the international community, \r\nparticularly Europe, in transforming the Mediterranean \r\nSea into a place where we meet the challenge of dignity. \r\nIf we do not prioritize the values of humanity and pietas \r\nin that geographic area, in that corner of the world, \r\nwe will have betrayed our tradition. That is why Italy \r\naccepts the challenge launched today by the President \r\nof the United States to the General Assembly by stating \r\nthat we will always be on the side of democracy, \r\nfreedom, values and ideals, with the determination \r\nthat f lows from those who have a great dream and a \r\nA/71/PV.10 21/09/2016\r\n30/30 16-29415\r\ngreat vision, but also at the same time the deep desire \r\nto make politics into a noble and concrete activity, \r\nby intervening without leaving the responsibility \r\nfor follow-up to others and by fully embracing the \r\ndeeper meaning of the challenge that we, for our part, \r\ncall humanity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Council of Ministers of the Republic of \r\nItaly for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Matteo Renzi, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Republic of Italy, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.15 p.m.\r\n"
