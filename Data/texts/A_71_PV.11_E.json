"United Nations A/71/PV.11\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n11th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 21 September 2016, 9.15 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.15 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the \r\nRepublic of Finland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Finland.\r\nMr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic \r\nof Finland, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic \r\nof Finland, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Niinistö: I wish to congratulate you, \r\nSir, upon your election as the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. You can count on \r\nFinland ś full support in your important responsibilities.\r\nThis will be the last General Assembly for the \r\ncurrent Secretary-General in that capacity. I thank \r\nhim for his untiring efforts to advance the common \r\ngood of humankind. During his time in office, he \r\nhas been instrumental in setting an ambitious agenda \r\nfor sustainable development and for tackling climate \r\nchange. Those achievements will make a difference \r\nfor generations to come. We had the pleasure of \r\nhosting the Secretary-General last December, when \r\nFinland marked its sixtieth anniversary as a Member \r\nof the United Nations. It was an opportunity to remind \r\nourselves of what the United Nations stands for. The \r\nUnited Nations is the embodiment and arbiter of the \r\nrules-based international system of sovereign States. \r\nIt is the only truly global body that we have, but we \r\nmust work together to ensure that it functions better in \r\nfulfilling its many tasks.\r\nUnfortunately, the world continues to confront \r\nchallenges to international peace and security all \r\nover. Narrow-minded nationalism, racism and violent \r\nextremism are on the rise. We must battle those \r\ndestructive ideologies. The recent nuclear test by North \r\nKorea is a cause for grave concern. The conflict in \r\nUkraine still awaits its resolution. All illegal actions, \r\nincluding the annexation of Crimea by Russia, are to be \r\ncondemned. The complex and horrendous conflicts in \r\nand around Syria and Iraq continue to affect not only \r\nthe Middle East but, indirectly, also Europe, including \r\nmy own country, Finland.\r\nSuch conflicts have already killed and maimed \r\nhundreds of thousands and displaced many more. They \r\nhave given rise to unprecedented f lows of asylum- \r\nseekers towards and into Europe. European societies are \r\ncompassionate, but today they are under stress. Their \r\ncapacity to provide for asylum-seekers and to integrate \r\nthem at home, or to provide humanitarian assistance \r\nabroad, has limits.\r\nDuring the week of the United Nations high-level \r\nmeeting, we discussed refugees and migration, and \r\nfor good reason. We have to work together to find \r\nsustainable solutions at the global and regional levels \r\nto better control borders, while safeguarding the rights \r\nof those seeking international protection on the basis \r\nof a well-founded fear of persecution.

The alternative is stark: \r\nborders will become walls closed even to those entitled \r\nto refugee status.\r\nThe problem is severe. Every day tens of thousands \r\nof people are displaced as a result of conflict, \r\npersecution or natural disasters, while others are on \r\nthe move seeking a better life. There is an increasing \r\nneed for humanitarian assistance. The European Union \r\nand my country, as a member, will continue to shoulder \r\ntheir share of responsibility in efforts to deal with the \r\ncrisis, but it will never be enough. Humanitarian action \r\nwill never compensate for the inability to address the \r\nroot causes of forced migration.\r\nIt is important to take a longer-term perspective. \r\nThe conflicts that we are now facing require urgent \r\nhumanitarian action, and yet the underlying causes are \r\nlong term. Economic, social and political progress is, \r\ntherefore, imperative. The international community \r\ncan and must assist. The United Nations, for its part, \r\ncan help to defuse latent conflicts through conflict \r\nprevention, mediation and, if necessary, preventive \r\npeace operations. However, the ultimate responsibility \r\nfor redesigning societies lies with the peoples concerned \r\nand their Governments. Local ownership is the solution. \r\nFor a number of years Finland and Turkey have led efforts \r\nto strengthen United Nations-based mediation. There is \r\na need to foster closer cooperation between different \r\nactors, such as traditional and religious leaders, and \r\nto draw more participation from civil society. We are \r\npleased that progress is being made, as evidenced by \r\nthe adoption of the latest General Assembly resolution \r\non mediation (resolution 70/304) just two weeks ago.\r\nThis year marks the sixtieth anniversary of \r\nFinland’s participation in United Nations peacekeeping. \r\nSince 1956, some 50,000 Finnish men and women \r\nhave served in United Nations operations around the \r\nworld. Finnish citizens continue to serve in the Middle \r\nEast and elsewhere, and some of them have made the \r\nultimate sacrifice. We honour the work of those men \r\nand women. \r\nFinland is committed to ongoing efforts aimed at \r\nstrengthening the various aspects of peace operations. \r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s efforts to bring \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping into the twenty-first \r\ncentury. The Leaders’ Summit on Peacekeeping hosted \r\nby President Obama of the United States last year was \r\na significant step in the right direction and needs to be \r\ncontinued. \r\nThe problem of the illicit f low of conventional \r\nweapons persists, but finally progress has been \r\nmade — the Arms Trade Treaty has entered into force. \r\nHowever, two tasks remain — the Treaty needs to be \r\nadopted by all and implemented effectively. It has not \r\nbeen ratified by many of the Member States whose \r\ncontributions are needed, and so I urge Members to join \r\nwithout delay.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment a year ago was a milestone, as was \r\nthe conclusion of the Paris Agreement to combat \r\nclimate change. The true test, however, will be the \r\nimplementation of those instruments, which, in \r\nFinland, is being carried out in an inclusive way. We \r\nare focusing on establishing partnerships among the \r\nGovernment, the private sector, universities and civil \r\nsociety. All Finnish citizens are encouraged to get \r\ninvolved. I have personally committed to reducing my \r\ncarbon footprint by half over a decade by signing up \r\nwith the Global Citizens Climate Pledge initiative. The \r\ninitiative was made global a couple of weeks ago in an \r\nevent hosted by the Secretariat of the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. A similar \r\nmechanism exists for inclusive participation in support \r\nof the 2030 Agenda.\r\nGender equality and the political, economic and \r\nsocial empowerment of girls and women are key drivers \r\nfor sustainable development and for combating climate \r\nchange. In my own country, gender equality has been \r\nvital in our rise from poverty to prosperity. I welcome \r\nall efforts that raise the issue, such as the HeForShe \r\nmovement initiated by the United Nations Entity for \r\nGender Equality and the Empowerment of Women. I am \r\npersonally involved in that important work. However, \r\nthe United Nations and its Member States still have a \r\nlong way to go to meet their target of gender equality.\r\nThe next Secretary-General will be subject to \r\nalmost colossal expectations. Finland welcomes a \r\nselection process that is more transparent and more \r\ninclusive. We also welcome the fact that there are so \r\nmany female candidates interested in the position. \r\nWe too have a message for the incoming United \r\nNations leader. We would like to see the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral work closely together with, and, if necessary, \r\nsometimes even one step ahead of, the Security \r\nCouncil in fulfilling the mandate of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Another challenge is to improve \r\nthe United Nation’s functions as an organization. The \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 3/48\r\nnext Secretary-General can do that by ensuring that \r\nthe various United Nation activities complement each \r\nother, so that the United Nations truly delivers as one. \r\nLet me finish by assuring the Assembly of \r\nFinland’s full support for the incoming Secretary-\r\nGeneral — whoever she or he may be.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Finland \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Sauli Niinistö, President of the Republic \r\nof Finland, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: Let me begin my congratulating \r\nyou, Sir, on your election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. I also extend \r\nour deep appreciation to your immediate predecessor, \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his able stewardship of the \r\nseventieth session of the Assembly.\r\nWe all vividly recall the momentous occasion in \r\nSeptember last year when we adopted the ambitious \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This session \r\nof the General Assembly provides us with a unique \r\nopportunity to review the measures we have taken so \r\nfar, at both the international and national levels, in \r\nline with our commitments to global socioeconomic \r\ntransformation. We hope that this time around this \r\nAgenda will meet a better fate.\r\nWe are encouraged that since September last \r\nyear, foundational steps have been and are being \r\ntaken at various levels to implement the 2030 Agenda. \r\nIn this regard, we note the convening of the Global \r\nInfrastructure Forum in April 2016, the convening of \r\nthe Multi-stakeholder Forum on Science, Technology \r\nand Innovation for the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nin June, and the launch of the Technology Facilitation \r\nMechanism together with the activation of its online \r\nplatform. We also note the follow-up meetings \r\npertaining to the development of concrete actions for \r\nthe implementation of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda \r\non financing for development. These activities at the \r\nglobal level have been equally matched at the national \r\nlevel, with virtually all Member States reporting \r\nmaking preparations for the implementation of this \r\nuniversal Agenda.\r\nFor our part, I am happy to report that we have \r\nestablished national and multi-stakeholder and \r\nmultisectoral structures to assimilate and implement \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. We have done that in a coordinated \r\nand integrated manner, with our national development \r\nprogramme, the Zimbabwe Agenda for Sustainable \r\nSocio-Economic Transformation. Our task of \r\nassimilating the 2030 Agenda has been made relatively \r\nless challenging, in that the vision and aspirations of \r\nour national economic blueprint and the global agenda \r\nare basically the same. Our biggest impediment to \r\nthe achievement of the 2030 Agenda is the burden of \r\npunitive and heinous sanctions imposed against us by \r\nsome hegemonic and neo-imperialist Powers among us \r\nhere.\r\nMy country, Zimbabwe, is the innocent victim of \r\nthe spiteful sanctions imposed by the United States and \r\nother Western Powers. These countries have maintained \r\nthe sanctions on us for some 16 years now. As a country, \r\nwe are being collectively punished for exercising the one \r\nprimordial principle enshrined in the United Nations \r\nCharter, that of sovereign independence. We are being \r\npunished for doing what all other nations have done and \r\nstill do, namely, possess and own their natural resources \r\nand attend to the basic interests of their people. Those \r\nwho have imposed these sanctions would rather have us \r\npander to their interests at the expense of the basic needs \r\nof the majority of our people. As long as these economic \r\nand financial sanctions remain in place, Zimbabwe’s \r\ncapacity to fully and effectively implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda will be deeply curtailed. I repeat my call on the \r\nUnited Kingdom, Europe, the United States and their \r\nallies to lift the illegal and unjustified sanctions against \r\nmy country and its people. Let us all be bound by our \r\ncommitments to the 2030 Agenda, in which we agreed \r\nto eschew sanctions in favour of dialogue.\r\nThe General Assembly will elect the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral of our Organization at the current session. We \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n4/48 16-29421\r\nhave witnessed commendable efforts aimed at making \r\nthe selection process of the next Secretary-General \r\ninclusive and transparent. The greater involvement of \r\nthe General Assembly and therefore of the majority \r\nof our membership does not, however, mask the \r\nopaqueness of the process at the Security Council level. \r\nWe expect the current experience to lead to a more \r\ninclusive and transparent process in the future.\r\nFor over 20 years, many of us have come to this \r\nrostrum, demanding and pleading for the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council. We are no closer to achieving that goal \r\ntoday than we were 20 years ago. This is so, in spite of the \r\nuniversal acknowledgement of the injustice, unfairness \r\nand inappropriateness of the current composition of the \r\nCouncil. We now have an opportunity in the ongoing \r\nintergovernmental negotiations to redress this unjust \r\nand unjustifiable situation in the interest of a strong \r\nand more united Organization capable of delivering on \r\nits mandate.\r\nOur common commitment to leaving no one behind \r\ndemands that we address the plight of people still \r\nliving under colonialism and occupation. The people of \r\nPalestine have lived under occupation and persecution \r\nfor over 49 years. It is high time that the United Nations, \r\nin particular the Security Council, fulfilled its Charter \r\nduties and obligations by implementing its resolutions, \r\nwhich include General Assembly resolution 181 (II) \r\nand Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 \r\n(1973). The two-State solution, based on the pre-June \r\n1967 borders, should now be pursued within those \r\nparameters and timelines. This is the only way to \r\nachieve durable peace in the Middle East.\r\nOn our own continent, the United Nations is duty-\r\nbound by Charter principle to redouble its efforts \r\nto ensure the full realization of the right of self-\r\ndetermination of the people of Western Sahara. The \r\n2030 Agenda recognizes that sustainable development \r\ncannot be achieved without the full realization of the \r\nright of the peoples living under colonial and foreign \r\noccupation. We urge the holding of the independence \r\nreferendum for the Sahrawi people without much \r\nfurther delay.\r\nI would like to conclude by thanking the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the tremendous work \r\nhe has done during his tenure. We have appreciated \r\nhis presence at African Union summits and his visits \r\nto Africa as a clear testimony to his commitment to \r\nand partnership with Africa in advancing the cause of \r\nfreedom, development and peace — and the security of \r\nour continent. We particularly applaud the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s leadership in mobilizing the entire United \r\nNations system and indeed the international community \r\nto partner with Africa in stopping and rolling back the \r\nEbola epidemic, which claimed thousands of lives and \r\nundermined Africa’s socioeconomic development. He \r\nhas indeed been an indefatigable advocate for self-\r\ndetermination and a persistent champion of inclusive \r\ndevelopment, peace and coalition-building for dealing \r\nwith humanitarian and other crises. We wish him well \r\nin all his future endeavours, and I am sure that many of \r\nus will miss him, especially we of Africa.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of \r\nZimbabwe for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Ms. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President \r\nof the Republic of Chile\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chile.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of \r\nthe Republic of Chile, and to invite her to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Bachelet Jeria (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nare living in times that show us the necessity of shifting \r\nour perspective with regard to addressing development. \r\nOur world is in the midst of a crisis that extends back \r\nyears, and which, far from being resolved, has only \r\nworsened, generating criticism of political institutions \r\nthat do not seem capable of representing their citizens. \r\nAt the same time, economic growth has given way to a \r\nglobal slowdown and has not been able to provide the \r\nworld’s population with the well-being that it seeks.\r\nIt would appear that the far-reaching dynamics that \r\ncaused the crisis some years ago were not superseded \r\nbut merely superficially retouched. But citizens today \r\nare more aware and empowered. Thanks to new \r\ntechnology, they have new means of expression. They \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 5/48\r\nare showing us that in their daily lives, at their places \r\nof work, at their children’s schools, in the health of their \r\nfamilies, in the security of their cities, in the pensions \r\nof their mothers and fathers and in the relations between \r\nmen and women, the negative effects of inequitable \r\ndevelopment are still being felt. This is the main basis \r\nfor the citizen discontent that we have seen in various \r\nparts of the world.\r\nAt the same time, we are facing an unprecedented \r\nenvironmental crisis that threatens life on earth, has \r\nmedical, clinical, economic, climatic and environmental \r\nimpacts and mostly affects the most vulnerable. These \r\nare combined with violence and armed conflict in many \r\nparts of the world, which increase precariousness and \r\nexponentially expand forced displacement and major \r\nmigratory movements.\r\nCitizen discontent is the expression of \r\ndisillusionment about the promised development that \r\nthey desire and for which they have fought valiantly \r\nbut which is still beyond their reach. We are witnessing \r\na growing schism between the representatives and \r\nthe represented. There is a lack of trust in national \r\nGovernments as well as in multilateral forums. They \r\nappear not to be tackling the priorities of the common \r\ncitizen in a timely manner or with the required depth. \r\nNow is not the time for taking the easy but ultimately \r\ndestructive route of populism. Now is the time for \r\naction inspired by an ethically motivated and civically \r\noriented pragmatism.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals that we are \r\ncommitted to achieving by 2030 demonstrate that the \r\ninternational community knows that it must embark on \r\nfar-reaching changes and implement them with concrete \r\nmeasures. Now we must summon up the political will in \r\nmultilateral forums and in each of our countries. There \r\nis inertia to be overcome and there are interests to be \r\ndealt with. The political and development crisis that \r\nwe are facing has global dynamics. Nobody, no nation \r\nor social group can do it alone. We need to engage in \r\nmultilateral dialogues at the regional and global levels, \r\nassuming realistic but demanding commitments. I \r\ninsist that we must act now. At home, the citizens are \r\nwaiting for us, asking us to transmit their demands and \r\nreturn with decisions and determination. I hope that we \r\ncan do that.\r\nChile is a mid-sized country that is not yet fully \r\ndeveloped. However, its rapid modernization in recent \r\ndecades has placed us squarely at the frontier of the \r\nchallenges of modernity, with the tensions inherent in \r\ndemocracy and economic growth. I am speaking at this \r\nrostrum today having had this experience. I am also \r\nspeaking from experience of having embarked on the \r\nchanges requested by the citizens of my homeland. I \r\nknow how difficult it is to make changes, but I also know \r\nthe hope of seeing a new horizon gradually emerge. This \r\nis the course on which we have embarked as a nation, \r\nbut also as a part of the international community.\r\nAt the regional and international levels, our \r\ncountry has advocated convergence in diversity \r\nin Latin America, seeking a common agenda that, \r\ndespite our differences, gives us strength as a bloc \r\nand as a region. And we have made progress. We \r\nare working on integration with Mexico, Colombia \r\nand Peru in the Pacific Alliance, which already has \r\n49 observer States and which is growing stronger \r\ndecisively and pragmatically. Today, two integration \r\nmechanisms — the Pacific Alliance and the Southern \r\nCommon Market — are aiming to promote a better \r\nLatin America, strengthening cooperation and making \r\nclear that national development and international \r\nrelations cannot be seen as separate subjects.\r\nIn Latin America there are significant differences, \r\nbut we are working together in spite of them to meet \r\nthe new challenges. We are doing that within the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States, \r\nwhere 33 member States are seeking to confront the \r\nnew political, social and economic environment. In \r\naddition, within the Union of South American Nations, \r\nSouth American countries consult each other to address \r\ncommon political problems.\r\nOur nation’s principles are immutable and include \r\na call to peace, democracy and respect for human \r\nrights, respect for international law and the treaties, \r\nsovereignty and the obligation to cooperate. The \r\npromotion and protection of democracy and human \r\nrights at the international level are not contrary to the \r\nprinciple of non-intervention. In fact, today that is a \r\nglobal achievement.\r\nI believe that Colombia has given us one of the \r\ngreatest pieces of news this year. At the regional and \r\ninternational levels, there is hope for peace. Next \r\nMonday, the agreement to end the hostilities of a civil \r\nwar that has been raging for more than 50 years will \r\nbe signed. Chile, a country that also had a difficult \r\ntransition to democracy, would like to continue \r\nsupporting its Latin American brother in handling its \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n6/48 16-29421\r\npost-conflict situation, including with military and \r\npolice observers in the United Nations political mission, \r\nworking with it in solidarity as we have done in other \r\nbrother countries such as Haiti.\r\nWe have committed to the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Similarly, we signed the Paris \r\nAgreement — the most ambitious and robust agreement \r\nin the history of multilateral negotiations on climate \r\nchange. Together with Monaco and France, we proposed \r\nthe Because the Ocean Declaration to stress the need to \r\npay special attention to the way in which environmental \r\ndegradation affects ocean waters. It has been signed by \r\nmore than 30 countries.\r\nProtecting the oceans is vital for our common \r\nfuture, and today they are under threat. Chile has \r\ntherefore decided to take action by creating the Nazca-\r\nDesventuradas Marine Park, which is the largest of its \r\nkind in Latin America. We are also engaged in a South-\r\nSouth cooperation project to assist Caribbean countries \r\nin combating marine pollution.\r\nOutside of this building and in the most diverse \r\ncorners of the world, people, their leaders, civil society \r\nand the media are expecting the States Members of \r\nthis Organization to provide cooperative, creative and \r\ntangible responses to the problems of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. That is why I raise my voice again in favour \r\nof Security Council reform to reflect today’s new \r\nrealities. I raise my voice in favour of an effective \r\nmanagement of the United Nations and greater openness \r\nin its procedures, including the election of its new \r\nSecretary-General. I ask him or her to be committed \r\nto the principles that serve the people who founded \r\nthe Organization. We know that successfully meeting \r\nchallenges requires joint, consensual efforts. We need \r\nmore multilateralism, cooperation and dialogue. This \r\nis an irreplaceable forum for debate and adoption of \r\nagreements. It is a platform for coordinated action.\r\nMs. Kasese-Bota (Zambia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nChile is a country open to the world, which promotes \r\nclear-cut rules and political and economic agreements \r\nin order to move forward. The United Nations must \r\nplay its role as a place of consensus in opposition to \r\ninequality and the discrimination against religious, \r\nethnic and gender minorities, a place to which the most \r\nvulnerable may turn. Let us make the United Nations \r\nthe Organization that our peoples need and call for.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Chile for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Michelle Bachelet Jeria, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chile, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hage Geingob, President of the \r\nRepublic of Namibia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Namibia.\r\nMr. Hage Geingob, President of the Republic \r\nof Namibia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Hage Geingob, President of \r\nthe Republic of Namibia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Geingob: Let me congratulate the \r\nPresident on his election to preside over the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. He hails from \r\na country that is held in high esteem and greatly \r\nrespected by the Namibian people. Namibia is a \r\nchild of international solidarity and was midwifed \r\nby the United Nations. Fiji was one of the countries \r\nthat contributed peacekeepers to the United Nations \r\nTransition Assistance Group in Namibia. Given his \r\nbackground, we are confident that this session will be \r\na complete success.\r\nThe President rightly emphasized in his acceptance \r\nspeech (see A/70/PV.103) that the main purpose of the \r\nseventy-first session would be to achieve momentum \r\non the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nSuch momentum is evidenced by the choice of theme \r\nof the session, “The Sustainable Development Goals: \r\na universal push to transform our world”. Namibia \r\njoins the President in reiterating the fact that the \r\nimplementation of this Agenda is imperative if we are \r\nto safeguard a secure world for future generations.\r\nAs the Secretary-General has said in his report on \r\nthe work of the United Nations (A/71/1), the people of \r\nthe world have implored the United Nations to do more \r\nnow — in more spheres of activity, in more locations, \r\nin more challenging circumstances — than at any other \r\npoint in the history of the Organization. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s commitment to the Organization and \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 7/48\r\nconcern about the present issues affecting the world \r\nhave impressed me. He indicated that he has fought to \r\nleave the Organization better prepared for the immense \r\nchallenges ahead and capable of serving its entire \r\nmembership and “we the peoples” in every corner \r\nof the world. He has raised the bar, and, indeed, the \r\nonus is now on us to carry the mantle of humanitarian \r\nexcellence to even greater heights.\r\nIn September last year, we committed ourselves to \r\na new Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are all \r\nin agreement that the effective implementation of that \r\nAgenda will require coherence and complementarity \r\namong global, continental, regional, national and local \r\nefforts, as stated in the Secretary-General’s report. \r\nWe are confident that we will join the global drive \r\nto ensure a life of dignity for all. We will spare no \r\neffort in working to free our fellow men, women and \r\nchildren from the abject and dehumanizing conditions \r\nof extreme poverty.\r\nNamibia agrees with the notion that the Agenda, \r\nsuccessor to the Millennium Development Goals, will \r\nneed to fully integrate economic growth, social justice \r\nand environmental stewardship. In terms of economic \r\ngrowth, we need to talk about inclusive growth that will \r\ntranslate into the creation of decent jobs opportunities \r\nfor our citizens. In other words, we must do more to \r\nmove away from the current jobless growth model that \r\nprevails in many of our member countries. We should \r\ntherefore aim to grow our economy in a sustainable and \r\ninclusive manner in order to ensure that we effectively \r\ntackle the scourge of poverty.\r\nAs a consequence of the slowdown in the global \r\neconomic cycle and a drop in commodity prices, the \r\nNamibian economy is experiencing a downturn this \r\nyear, following robust growth averaging more than 5 per \r\ncent during the previous five years. We are mindful that, \r\nin order to make a meaningful dent in poverty, we need \r\nto grow at a higher level. We remain optimistic about \r\nthe long-term outlook for Namibia, as key economic \r\nfundamentals, including fiscal and external current \r\naccount sustainability, remain intact. A testament to \r\nthis is the fact that the Fitch Ratings agency recently \r\naffirmed Namibia’s international default rate at BBB-, \r\nwith bond issuance in the South African and Namibian \r\nmarkets at AA+, although the longer-term outlook was \r\nrevised from stable to negative.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Namibia \r\nremains committed to managing the economy in \r\na prudent and responsible manner and has already \r\ninstituted expenditure, revenue and structural reform \r\nmeasures to address concerns raised by rating agencies \r\nabout the long-term outlook of our country We would \r\nlike to assure all our partners that there is no risk of \r\nNamibia not honouring its debt obligations in the near \r\nand medium terms. In fact, we remain bullish about \r\nthe country’s economic outlook. Moreover, we remain \r\ncommitted to creating conditions in Namibia that will \r\nenable the full participation of the private sector in the \r\neconomy. The Government alone cannot shoulder the \r\nburden of extending development to all. The private \r\nsector has a crucial role to play in stimulating economic \r\ngrowth and job creation in our country.\r\nRegarding social justice, we are all concerned by \r\nthe fact that we are witnessing the highest levels of \r\nforced displacement of people since the founding of \r\nthis Organization. The current refugee crisis needs \r\nour immediate attention and our collective action. As \r\nthe Secretary-General says in his report (A/71/1), global \r\nsolidarity is needed for us to effectively respond to the needs \r\nof our fellow human beings. We need to determine the basic \r\nfactors that cause people to flee in such large numbers so that \r\nwe can tackle the root causes, rather than the symptoms, of \r\nthis evil. Our belief is that no one must feel left out, for we \r\nare aware that inclusivity spells peace, while exclusivity spells \r\nwar.\r\nEarlier this morning we attended the high-level event \r\non the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. Namibia welcomes this development, and we are \r\nhappy to announce that we have ratified the Agreement, \r\nwhich represents a milestone in our endeavours to fight \r\nthe devastating effects of climate change. Climate change \r\nis a global problem and requires a global response from all \r\nof us, in both developed and developing countries. In this \r\nregard, the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and the Sendai Declaration on disaster risk \r\nreduction remain the central multilateral frameworks for \r\ncooperative action for addressing climate-change-induced \r\ndisaster risks, such as drought.\r\nNamibia is one of the driest countries in the world. \r\nConsequently, we have undertaken ambitious domestic \r\naction on climate change, including mitigation and \r\nadaptation, to surmount the losses and damages arising from \r\nclimate-change-induced natural disasters. At the same time, \r\nwe are developing renewable energy resources, such as solar, \r\nwind and hydroelectricity power. In tackling this crisis, the \r\nprinciple of common yet differentiated responsibility must \r\nbe upheld.\r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n8/48 16-29421\r\nFurthermore, the activation of the Green Climate Fund \r\nis a welcome and timely development. This accords us an \r\nopportunity to decentralize the operations of the Fund. \r\nIn this context, I wish to announce Namibia’s offer to host \r\nthe African regional hub of the Green Climate Fund at the \r\nappropriate time. As members may recall, Namibia came \r\nin second to South Korea in the bid to host the world \r\nheadquarters of the Green Climate Fund. As a consolation \r\nprize, we would therefore be honoured to host the African \r\nregional hub of the Green Climate Fund. Namibia counts on \r\nthe support of Member States.\r\nNamibia believes that the United Nations remains \r\nthe centre for the consolidation of international rule of \r\nlaw. Therefore, the United Nations system should serve as a \r\nbanner of transparency and accountability. For Governments \r\nand organizations such as the United Nations to regain the \r\ntrust of people who have lost trust in global leadership over \r\nthe years, inclusivity and transparency must be placed at the \r\nforefront of governance; for transparency plus accountability \r\nequals trust.\r\nReforming the Security Council is therefore paramount. \r\nThe reform of the Security Council cannot be reduced to \r\nthe aspirations of a few countries. The Security Council is \r\ntoo important an organ to be left to the interests of a few. \r\nHence we reiterate our call for the comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council, thereby making it more democratic \r\nand transparent so as to better serve humanity. Namibia \r\nremains fully committed to the Common African Position \r\non the proposed reform of the United Nations. We are of \r\nthe opinion that the Security Council should reflect the \r\nbroad membership of our Organization. Fairness and justice \r\nwarrant that Africa be part of the equation.\r\nAs a nation that emerged from a long, bitter and bloody \r\nstruggle for independence and has since enjoyed 26 years of \r\nfreedom, Namibia sympathizes with those who are not yet \r\nindependent and who are denied their basic human rights. \r\nAccordingly, Namibia calls for the full implementation of \r\nall relevant United Nations resolutions on Palestine. The \r\ninternational community must fulfil its obligations and \r\nassist the people of Palestine in realizing their basic right to \r\nindependence and self-determination. Their freedom and \r\nindependence cannot be denied forever  — it can only be \r\ndelayed. Let history be our best teacher.\r\nNamibia recognizes and acknowledges the role played \r\nby the Kingdom of Morocco in helping us attain our \r\nindependence. I can proudly say that the people of Morocco \r\nare our brothers and sisters, which was affirmed during my \r\ntwo-day visit to that country. We are a nation that believes in \r\nbeing an enemy to none and a friend to all, and we also believe \r\nin a world where no one should feel left out. Unfortunately, \r\nour brothers and sisters in Western Sahara do feel left out.\r\nWe therefore hope that the people of Western Sahara will \r\nsoon enjoy the freedom that the Kingdom of Morocco helped \r\nNamibia to attain. It is in this regard that we call for the full \r\nimplementation of resolutions calling for a referendum in \r\noccupied Western Sahara, so that the people there can freely \r\nexpress themselves as to whether they opt for independence \r\nor unification with Morocco and so that the disagreement \r\nbetween brothers and sisters can come to an amicable end.\r\nNamibia remains confident that despite the fact that \r\nhumankind faces some of the most unprecedented challenges \r\nin its history, under the United Nations we can live up to the \r\npromise of ensuring a life of dignity for all. Let us not lose \r\nheart, for Saint Teresa of Calcutta once said: “If we have no \r\npeace, it is because we have forgotten that we belong to each \r\nother.” Let us therefore realize that our differences should not \r\ndraw us further from one another, but, rather, nearer to each \r\nother. Let us celebrate unity in diversity.\r\nTogether as people who realize that we belong to each \r\nother, we can bring about change in this world through this \r\nindispensable institution — the United Nations. It is time to \r\nusher in a new era of humanity, characterized by peace, unity \r\nand dignity for all the world’s citizens.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Namibia for the statement just made.\r\nMr. Hage Geingob, President of the Republic of \r\nNamibia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Li Keqiang, Premier of the \r\nState Council of the People’s Republic of China\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Premier of the State Council of \r\nthe People’s Republic of China.\r\nMr. Li Keqiang, Premier of the State Council of \r\nthe People’s Republic of China, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Li Keqiang, Premier of \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 9/48\r\nthe State Council of the People’s Republic of China, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Li Keqiang (China) (spoke in Chinese): I wish \r\nto congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. I believe that under his presidency, this \r\nsession will make good progress on its agenda. I also \r\nwish to express appreciation for the effective work of \r\nMr. Lykketoft, President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventieth session. I also would like to pay tribute \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has with \r\nmodesty and a drive for harmony and inclusiveness \r\nworked diligently and in a down-to-earth manner \r\nover the past decade and whose work has contributed \r\nsignificantly to world peace, sustainable development \r\nand the advancement and protection of human rights \r\naround the world.\r\nIn 2015, the United Nations held a summit to \r\nconsider the post-2015 development agenda and \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich has offered a new vision for global development. \r\nAt the summit, China’s President Xi Jinping delivered \r\na speech (see A/70/PV.7) entitled, “Towards win-win \r\npartnerships for sustainable development”, in which \r\nhe expounded on China’s principles and positions. The \r\nyear 2016 is the first year for the implementation of \r\nthat Agenda.\r\nThe general debate at the seventy-first session \r\nfocuses on “The Sustainable Development Goals: a \r\nuniversal push to transform our world”, a theme that \r\ncould not be more relevant. On behalf of the Chinese \r\nGovernment, I would like to state today that China has \r\ntaken action to advance the Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, and it has been one of the first States to \r\nsubmit its national plan on the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda to the United Nations.\r\nSustainable development concerns development \r\nfirst and foremost, and development underpins every \r\nhuman achievement. Without development, nothing is \r\nsustainable. The lack of development is often at the root \r\nof many of the world’s problems — poverty, the refugee \r\ncrisis, war, conflicts or terrorism. All of these could be \r\nattributed to insufficient development, and none of them \r\ncan be satisfactorily resolved without development. \r\nOnly development can guarantee people’s fundamental \r\nrights and interests. Only development can root out the \r\ncauses for global challenges. Only development can \r\npromote human civilization and progress.\r\nOf course, development must be sustainable in all \r\nits dimensions. Otherwise, development, and especially \r\ngrowth, will stall. Growth will stall and be held back. \r\nDevelopment cannot be sustainable if it is unbalanced \r\nand unequal and widens the gap between the North \r\nand the South, and between the rich and the poor. \r\nDevelopment cannot be sustainable if it is expensive, \r\nif it is driven by high consumption with high pollution \r\nand high carbon emissions, or if it depletes resources \r\nand strains the environment. Development cannot be \r\nsustainable if economic growth and social progress are \r\nnot well coordinated. Only when we have a profound \r\nunderstanding of the implications of sustainability, \r\nmake progress in poverty reduction at all levels, engage \r\nin North-South and South-South cooperation, adapt to \r\nclimate change, and promote equal sharing and green \r\ndevelopment can we ensure that development will hold \r\nits ground and be sustainable.\r\nSustainable development must be inclusive and \r\ninterconnected. Currently, the sustainable development \r\nendeavour is faced with great challenges. Regional \r\nconflicts and hotspots are without end. Traditional \r\nand non-traditional security threats intertwine, and \r\nthe environment for sustainable development gives no \r\nreason for optimism. World economic recovery remains \r\nlukewarm, and globalization faces strong headwinds. \r\nThe momentum for sustainable development is weak. \r\nThere are frequent outbreaks of major infectious diseases \r\nand the eruption of natural disasters. Other issues to be \r\nfaced are energy and resource security, food security \r\nand financial security. As those elements become \r\nintertwined, sustainable development necessarily \r\nfaces an uphill battle. Such difficult moments call for \r\ngreater confidence.\r\nHumankind has the wisdom and the ability to find \r\na way out. For that to happen, there must be cooperation \r\nand a spirit of working together to overcome difficulties. \r\nIt is time that the international community assumes \r\na new perspective, sees itself as a community with a \r\nshared future and interconnected interests and makes \r\nconcerted efforts to tackle global challenges.\r\nFor sustainable development to evolve, we must \r\nkeep both short-term and long-term interests in mind \r\nwhile making concrete efforts to tackle challenges, \r\nactively transform and change our world, and achieve \r\nour new vision. We are ready to and must uphold the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Without peace and stability, there will be no \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n10/48 16-29421\r\nsustainable development; even the development gains \r\nalready attained risk being lost.\r\nThe hard-won peace that has prevailed over the \r\npast 70 or more years testifies to the effectiveness of \r\nthe international order and the norms of international \r\nrelations based on the United Nations Charter. These \r\nnorms and this order must be resolutely upheld since \r\nthey not only serve the common interests of the people \r\nof all countries but also provide the most essential \r\nguarantee for achieving sustainable development.\r\nAll countries need to observe and effectively \r\nimplement the purposes and principles of the Charter, \r\nsupport the leading role of the United Nations and \r\nthe Security Council in global affairs, and support \r\nthe reform and improvement of global governance \r\nmechanisms to reflect the changes in the international, \r\npolitical and economic landscape. A new concept of \r\ncommon, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable \r\nsecurity should be nurtured. A global partnership that \r\nfeatures dialogue instead of confrontation, and mutual, \r\nwin-win benefits should be established.\r\nWe must pursue political solutions to hotspot \r\nissues. Political solutions are the fundamental way out. \r\nHistory has repeatedly shown that to repress violence \r\nwith force can only lead to more hatred and warfare \r\nfrom which no winner will emerge. Parties involved in \r\nconflicts must renounce a zero-sum mentality, settle \r\ndisputes through dialogue, address differences through \r\nconsultation and seek reconciliation with tolerance. \r\nThe mediation efforts of the international community \r\nmust be fair and impartial; they should facilitate the \r\nsettlement of issues, not invite new problems.\r\nOn Syria, we must remain committed to a political \r\nsolution. The international community should encourage \r\nall relevant parties in Syria to end the fighting at an \r\nearly date and reach a comprehensive political solution.\r\nOn the Korean nuclear issue, we should \r\nremain committed to the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula, uphold peace and stability on \r\nthe peninsula and seek consultation and dialogue \r\nso as to effectively maintain the international \r\nnuclear-non-proliferation regime.\r\nTerrorism is the common enemy of humankind and \r\nmust be combatted resolutely. At the same time, double \r\nstandards should not be applied, nor should terrorism \r\nbe linked with particular countries, races or religions.\r\nWe must work together for the safe, steady recovery \r\nof the world economy, which cannot afford to maintain \r\nthe long-term sluggishness we see now. Otherwise, \r\nsustainable development will be a fountain without a \r\nsource. The current world economy is faced with both \r\ninsufficient aggregate demand and prominent structural \r\ncontradictions. We need to employ various kinds of \r\neffective policy instruments in a holistic manner, \r\ncombine demand management with supply-side reform, \r\nand balance short-term policies with long-term ones.\r\nWe call on all countries to make concerted efforts \r\nto drive the global economy along a road of strong, \r\nsustainable, balanced and inclusive growth. Given \r\ntheir significant influence, major economies need to \r\nact responsibly in policymaking, particularly when \r\ncoordinating macroeconomic policies. While focusing \r\non their own growth, they also need to strive to reduce \r\nnegative spillover and refrain from adding to the \r\nweakness of the global economic recovery.\r\nEconomic globalization, represented by \r\nliberalization in and facilitation of trade and investment, \r\nhas been a significant driving force behind rapid global \r\ngrowth in past decades, but it is no panacea to the \r\nills of the world. Frankly, globalization has to some \r\ndegree taken its toll on industries and communities in \r\ncertain countries. Active measures need to be taken to \r\naddress the problem, but it is always important to keep \r\nin mind the bigger picture, instead of focusing only on \r\nnarrower interests.\r\nGlobalization is consistent with the long-term and \r\nfundamental interests of all countries. It is the trend of \r\nthe times. Countries need to firmly oppose protectionism \r\nin all its forms, resolutely uphold the free-trade regime \r\nrepresented by the World Trade Organization and \r\npromote sustained and sound economic growth for all \r\ncountries through win-win and all-win cooperation. We \r\nmust exert ourselves to address global challenges facing \r\nhumankind. Greater attention and more support need to \r\nbe given to Africa and the least developed countries \r\nto help them speed up industrialization, ensure food \r\nsecurity and eliminate poverty and hunger so that more \r\npeople can lead a life of decency and dignity.\r\nMore needs to be done to create an international \r\nenvironment that helps reduce inequality and imbalance \r\nin global development. International institutions should \r\nspend their new resources on helping developing \r\ncountries on a priority basis. Developed countries \r\nshould make good on their official development \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 11/48\r\nassistance commitments, while developing countries \r\nneed to pursue self-development and find paths suited \r\nto their national conditions.\r\nAs we speak, the world is facing the largest refugee \r\ncrisis since the Second World War. It is imperative to \r\nensure refugee access to basic living conditions in order \r\nto stave off humanitarian crises. It is of fundamental \r\nimportance to root out the causes of war and renew \r\ndevelopment so that countries of origin of refugees \r\ncan embark on a path of enduring peace, development \r\nand prosperity.\r\nCountries need to stay committed to the principles \r\nof common but differentiated responsibilities, equity \r\nand respective capabilities. They also need to jointly \r\ntackle climate change and work for the Paris Agreement \r\nto be universally accepted and take effect at an early \r\ndate. Developed countries need to play a leading role, \r\ndeliver on their emissions-reduction pledges and help \r\ndeveloping countries improve their capacity to mitigate \r\nand adapt to climate change.\r\nSince China adopted its reform and opening-up \r\npolicy, the Chinese economy has maintained rapid \r\ngrowth, becoming the world’s second-largest economy \r\nin 2010. In 2014, China’s gross domestic product \r\nreached $10 trillion. In recent years, despite a greater \r\nbasis of measurement for development, overall global \r\ncomplexity and long-accumulated underlying domestic \r\nissues, China has relied on reform and innovation to \r\nmaintain a medium-high growth rate and promoted \r\neconomic transformation and upgrading.\r\nIn the first half of this year, our growth rate was \r\n6.7 per cent, which was among the fastest in the major \r\neconomies. Over 13 million new urban jobs are added \r\nannually. In other words, in the first eight months of \r\nthis year, 9.5 million new urban jobs were created. \r\nEvery percentage point of growth now equals several \r\npercentage points of growth in previous years, and \r\nthe yearly economic increment is tantamount to the \r\neconomic aggregate of a middle-income country. \r\nChina’s effective management of its own affairs has been \r\nits greatest contribution to the world. Its contribution to \r\nglobal economic growth has been around 30 per cent.\r\nHowever, we remain sober about our achievements \r\nand believe that China remains a developing country; \r\nthere is still a long way to go before China achieves \r\nmodernization. We will continue to give priority to \r\ndevelopment and pursue comprehensive social and \r\neconomic growth, maintain a medium-high speed \r\nof economic growth and move to a medium-high \r\nlevel of development. China will continue to promote \r\ndevelopment through deepening reform.\r\nReform has held the key to our previous \r\nachievements in development, and the same will hold \r\ntrue for the future. We will promote development \r\nthrough expanding our opening-up policy. China’s \r\nexperience in past decades proves that a closed-door \r\npolicy only leads to stagnation and backwardness, and \r\nit is opening up that brings development and prosperity. \r\nWith a firm commitment to the win-win strategy of \r\nopening up, China will open its door even wider to the \r\noutside world.\r\nChina will promote development by upholding \r\npeace. The prolonged sufferings of war have made the \r\nChinese people cherish peace more than ever. As a \r\ndedicated follower of the path of peaceful development, \r\nChina will pursue friendship and cooperation with all \r\ncountries on the basis of the five principles of peaceful \r\ncoexistence. We uphold a mutual respect among all \r\ncountries, regardless of their size.\r\nChina also believes in working through dialogue, \r\nnegotiation and friendly consultation to address \r\nvarious differences and issues, including disputes over \r\nterritory and maritime rights and interests. We need to \r\nexpand common ground, shelve differences and make \r\ncontinuous efforts for regional peace and stability.\r\nChina has always worked for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of hotspot issues. On the occasion of this \r\nyear’s session of the General Assembly, China has \r\nclearly indicated that it will provide $300 million worth \r\nof humanitarian assistance to relevant countries and \r\ninternational organizations. Additionally, China will \r\nprovide assistance on all fronts to the underdeveloped \r\nand least developed countries.\r\nChina is a developing country with a population \r\nof 1.3 billion. We need to run our own affairs \r\neffectively while working to fulfil our due international \r\nresponsibilities. By the end of 2015, China had \r\ncontributed a total of over ¥400 billion to 166 countries \r\nand international and regional organizations and \r\nprovided training in various sectors to over 12 million \r\nprofessionals from other developing countries. Going \r\nforward, China will strengthen cooperation with other \r\ndeveloping countries and do whatever it can to help \r\nAfrican countries and the least developing countries.\r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n12/48 16-29421\r\nChina will only increase, not reduce, its support \r\nand assistance to other countries only as our economy \r\ngrows. We stand ready to work with all countries to \r\nachieve common development and prosperity and to \r\nsupport sustainable development and international \r\ncooperation in relevant fields. By 2020, China will \r\nincrease its total annual contributions to United Nations \r\ndevelopment agencies by $100 million over its 2015 \r\ncontribution level. China is a country that backs its \r\nwords with action. We will translate our commitments \r\ninto real actions.\r\nAchieving the goals for sustainable development is \r\nour shared task. Transforming our world and making \r\nit a better place is the common aspiration of all of us. \r\nChina stands ready to work with other members of \r\nthe international community, and make appropriate \r\ncontributions to building a world free from want where \r\ndevelopment and dignity are ensured for all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Premier of the State \r\nCouncil of the People’s Republic of China for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Li Keqiang, Premier of the State Council of the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Colombia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nColombia.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Juan Manuel Santos \r\nCalderón, President of the Republic of Colombia, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Santos Calderón (spoke in Spanish): In \r\n1981, today’s date, 21 September, was proclaimed as \r\nthe International Day of Peace to promote a negotiated \r\nsolution to armed conflicts throughout the world. Since \r\n1982, one year later, Colombia has been on a long and \r\ndifficult road to leave violence behind and attain peace. \r\nMy predecessors pursued peace for Colombians, each \r\nin his own way. This is a task that I undertook on the \r\nfirst day of my Government in August 2010.\r\nI have come to speak to members of the Assembly \r\non seven occasions on the progress and expectations of \r\nthe peace process between the Government of Colombia \r\nand the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \r\n(FARC) guerrilla group — the largest and oldest such \r\ngroup on the American continent. A year ago, standing \r\nhere before the Assembly (see A/70/PV.16), I said \r\nthat I expected to return in 2016 as the President of a \r\nColombia in peace — a reconciled Colombia.\r\nAfter more than half a century of internal armed \r\nconflict, I return to the United Nations today, on the \r\nInternational Day of Peace, to announce, with all \r\nthe strength of my voice and heart, that the war in \r\nColombia has ended. On 24 August in Havana, the \r\nnegotiators declared that all provisions were complete \r\nand adopted the final text of the General Agreement for \r\nthe Termination of the Conflict and the Construction of \r\na Stable and Lasting Peace. Five days later, a bilateral \r\nand definitive ceasefire and cessation of hostilities took \r\nplace. As a result, since then there has not been a single \r\ndeath, a single wound or a single bullet fired in the \r\nconflict with FARC.\r\nThe Agreement will be officially signed in \r\nCartagena de Indias on 26 September. The people \r\nof Colombia will approve it through a plebiscite on \r\n2 October. From that moment forward, the former \r\nmembers of the guerrilla group will go to different \r\ncantonment areas to begin surrendering their arms to \r\nthe United Nations within a six-month period, and to \r\nbegin their reintegration into society.\r\nTheir weapons will be melted and will be made into \r\nthree monuments to peace — one here in New York; \r\none in Cuba, where the peace negotiations took place; \r\nand another one in Colombia. These monuments will \r\nremind us that the bullets are behind us and that the \r\nconstruction of a new and better country has begun. \r\nJoyfully, I reiterate that the last and oldest armed \r\nconflict in the western hemisphere has come to an end. \r\nThe Americas — the two vast American continents with \r\nall of their islands, from Patagonia to Alaska — are \r\nnow a region of peace.\r\nThe Agreement that was reached after almost \r\nsix years of public conversations is the best news for \r\nColombia, Latin America and the world. What does the \r\nAgreement mean? Above all, it means that FARC will \r\ncease to exist as an armed group and reintegrate into \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 13/48\r\nsociety, and can become a political movement within our \r\ndemocracy. We have agreed on measures to guarantee \r\nits political participation, offer more assurances to the \r\nopposition and strengthen democracy and the electoral \r\nsystem in Colombia.\r\nWe have also outlined programmes to improve the \r\nquality of life of rural inhabitants, who have been the \r\nmost affected by the conflict, and to make land available \r\nto those who do not have it or who lost it because of the \r\nwar. A central aspect of this peace process is that it has \r\nfocused on the protection and guarantee of the rights \r\nof the victims: the rights to truth, justice, reparations \r\nand non-repetition. To that end, we have agreed on such \r\nmechanisms as a truth commission, reparation and \r\nrestoration measures, and a comprehensive transitional \r\njustice system.\r\nThis is the first time in the history of the resolution of \r\narmed conflicts anywhere in the world that a Government \r\nand an illegal armed group — through an agreement \r\nand not through external imposition — have agreed on \r\ntransitional justice. The perpetrators of international \r\ncrimes and other serious crimes will be investigated, \r\njudged and punished. This has been positively \r\nhighlighted by the Prosecutor of the International \r\nCriminal Court, the Inter-American Commission on \r\nHuman Rights and many other organizations and \r\nexperts. We are sure that this model of justice, which \r\nis framed within a comprehensive system to guarantee \r\nthe rights of the victims — as established by the Rome \r\nStatute — will be a useful precedent for future peace \r\nprocesses.\r\nI should like to highlight another aspect of the \r\nAgreement. We know that drug trafficking has fueled \r\nwar in Colombia and around the world. Thanks to the \r\nAgreement, FARC is committed to severing all ties \r\nwith this activity and to cooperating, through concrete \r\nactions, to combat this phenomenon. This is highly \r\nsymbolic, as those who once protected illicit coca crops \r\nwill now work with the State in eradicating them.\r\nA similar process will be take place with regard to \r\nthe anti-personnel mines that have killed and mutilated \r\nso many soldiers, police officers, farmers and children. \r\nThe State and FARC will work jointly to demine all of \r\nthe national territory. That will also have significant \r\nenvironmental benefits not only for our country, but \r\nalso for the planet. To the extent that  illegal crops are \r\nreplaced with legal ones, the deforestation caused by \r\ncoca cultivation will stop. No longer will millions of \r\nbarrels of oil spill into our rivers and oceans because \r\nof attacks on our oil infrastructure. We will be able to \r\nbetter take care of and preserve the natural lung that is \r\nthe Amazon.\r\nA new Colombia greets the international community \r\ntoday. It is a Colombia full of hope, a Colombia that, \r\nwithout war, is ready to reach its highest potential \r\nand to be a positive factor in the global context. It is \r\na Colombia where the resources that used to finance \r\nwar will now be better used on education, health and \r\nsecurity for its citizens. It is a Colombia that opens \r\nits arms to the world and welcomes investment, trade \r\nand tourism.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals have already \r\nbeen adopted into law in our country. We were the \r\nfirst country to do so. The Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange is now before Congress to be enacted into \r\nlaw. Peace will undoubtedly allow us to achieve these \r\ntransformative commitments with greater ease and \r\neffectiveness. \r\nToday, on behalf of almost 50 million Colombians, \r\nI express our deepest gratitude to the international \r\ncommunity for its ongoing and tireless support for \r\npeace in Colombia. We thank Cuba, the host of the \r\ndialogues, and Norway, which were guarantors of the \r\npeace negotiations, as well as Chile and Venezuela, \r\nwhich accompanied the entire process. I thank the \r\nUnited States, Germany and the European Union, which \r\nappointed special envoys to accompany the dialogues.\r\nWe especially thank the United Nations, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and the Security Council, which \r\nestablished a political mission to lead the monitoring \r\nand verification of the ceasefire and the disarmament \r\nof the guerrillas. I had the opportunity to thank the \r\nCouncil personally a few moments ago (see S/PV.7773). \r\nWe thank the countries of Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean, all of which supported this process. We are \r\nprofoundly grateful to so many Governments, countries \r\nand organizations that have continuously expressed \r\ntheir solidarity and willingness to support Colombia \r\nin the challenging post-conflict phase that lies ahead \r\nof us.\r\nI can say today, in this historic Hall, that we have \r\nsucceeded for Colombians and the world. Colombia is \r\nturning the page of war to start writing the chapter of \r\npeace. That is what we wish for the rest of the planet. \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n14/48 16-29421\r\nTherefore, we offer our full solidarity to the nations that \r\nhave suffered and continue to suffer from the scourge \r\nof global terrorism. The example of Colombia should \r\ngive hope to the world that it is possible to achieve the \r\ndream of peace when there is will and commitment.\r\nTo that end we must first disarm spirits and language, \r\nbecause words can be as harmful as bombs. We have to \r\ntake in and protect the victims and the most vulnerable, \r\nincluding the thousands of human beings that f lee war \r\nto seek opportunities beyond their borders. Colombia \r\nis more than ready to continue supporting the raison \r\nd’être of the United Nations — the search for peace in \r\nthe world.\r\nAs President of Colombians, I am happy and \r\nhumbly excited to announce to the Assembly the peace \r\nin Colombia. A conflict of over half a century — a \r\nconflict that left more than 220,000 people dead and \r\nclaimed more than 8 million victims — has come to \r\nan end. The bells of peace are ringing in Colombia and \r\ntheir echo is heard by all the nations represented in this \r\nHall. We do not want more war. We do not want more \r\nwars, not in Colombia and not in the rest of the world. \r\nToday we have a reason for hope. There is one less war \r\non the planet, and that is the war in Colombia.\r\nThe President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Colombia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, President of \r\nthe Republic of Colombia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. John Dramani Mahama, President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Ghana.\r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. John Dramani Mahama, President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Mahama: Allow me to first congratulate \r\nyou, Ambassador Peter Thompson, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session and to assure you of Ghana’s support \r\nand cooperation during this session and throughout \r\nyour tenure. I congratulate also Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon on his self less and dedicated service to \r\nour Organization over the past ten years and on his \r\nachievements during his tenure of office. His time as \r\nSecretary-General has witnessed some key defining \r\nmoments for the United Nations in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, development and \r\nhuman rights, and I commend him for his leadership.\r\nI am President of the Republic of Ghana. I was born \r\none year after my country gained independence from \r\ncolonial domination in 1957. I was born in the same \r\nyear as Michael Jackson, whose untimely tragic death \r\nshocked the whole world. Michael was also known as \r\nthe king of pop and was one of the greatest entertainers \r\nwho ever lived. The words of his 1991 hit song “Heal the \r\nWorld” continue to echo to us from his grave. Michael \r\nJackson sang, “Heal the world. Make the world a better \r\nplace for you and for me, and the entire human race”.\r\nHis song was released in 1991, at a time of excitement \r\nfor the world. In the 58 years of my life, I have seen the \r\nworld change more rapidly than in the millions of years \r\nof its existence. My life has spanned the excitement \r\nof the post-war era, the heady days of our liberation \r\nfrom colonial rule in Africa, the Apollo moon landing, \r\nthe Cold War, the excitement at the fall of the Berlin \r\nwall, the era of globalization, the end of apartheid, the \r\nglobal progress of the Millennium Development Goals \r\n(MDGs), the Arab Spring, Brexit, China’s slowdown, \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, the Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Sham, cyberattacks — and the list goes \r\non and on.\r\nOur world today is more complicated than it has \r\never been. The question I ask is: what happened to \r\nthe ideals that gave birth to the United Nations? What \r\nhappened to the enthusiasm that captured the spirit of \r\nthe post-war world, which envisioned peace, safety \r\nand security for all humankind? What happened to our \r\nexcitement at the thawing of the Cold War; to our joy at \r\nthe collapse of apartheid?\r\nThe era of the Cold War created a paradoxical \r\nsafety and security. The bipolar world and the arms \r\nrace assured mutual destruction from any nuclear war, \r\nand therefore the world was a more predictable place. \r\nThose of us in developing countries hid behind our \r\nshield of the Non-Aligned Movement. We marched \r\nagainst nuclear armaments and envisioned the day that \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 15/48\r\nthe nuclear arms race would end, so that the trillions \r\nof dollars that were being spent by the super-Powers \r\non nuclear weapons would yield a dividend that would \r\ncreate a life of prosperity for all people on Earth.\r\nPresident Reagan stood before the Brandenburg \r\nGate in Berlin in 1987 and said “Mr. Gorbachev, \r\nopen this gate. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall.” \r\nIn President Reagan’s words, walls cannot withstand \r\nfaith, walls cannot withstand truth, and walls cannot \r\nwithstand freedom. The fall of the Berlin Wall opened a \r\nvision of a new world — the era of globalization; an age \r\nwhere trade and interaction among people of the world \r\nwould spread prosperity across the globe. It did, to \r\nsome extent. The rise of the Asian tigers; the emerging \r\nworld of China, Brazil, South Africa and India; the turn \r\nof the millennium and the Millennium Development \r\nGoals raised millions of people out of poverty.\r\nA young man in West Africa drops out of school \r\nand takes to selling petty items along the streets of the \r\ncity. In agreement with four of his friends, they decide \r\nto raise money and try to make it to the greener pastures \r\nof Europe. They pay their way through the Niger and \r\narrive at Agadez, whence they brave the trek of death. \r\nThis is a dangerous hike across the harshest desert on \r\nEarth — the Sahara. They are attacked by bandits along \r\nthe way and robbed of all their money and provisions. \r\nThey are rescued by some Good Samaritans.\r\nTwo members of their group do not make it through \r\nthe desert crossing. After months of living under the \r\nthreat of death from many armed groups, including \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham in Libya, they \r\nfinally board an overloaded dinghy bound for Italy. \r\nRescued from the sea after their dinghy capsizes, only \r\none of them remains, held in a refugee detention centre \r\nin Italy. He is the lucky one — the only one of five \r\nfriends to survive the perilous journey. How long he \r\nwill remain in the detention centre, he does not know.\r\nThis could be the story of any young African \r\nseeking a better life in Europe. All over the world, there \r\nare new walls being built — walls that imprison us and \r\nblock us from the rest of the world. The young African \r\nrefugee in an Italian detention centre is facing one new \r\nsuch wall. In many parts of the world, extremist forces \r\nhave hijacked the dialogue, and among the millennial \r\ngeneration all available cutting-edge technology is \r\nused to spread anxieties that evoke fear and arouse our \r\nbasest emotions.\r\nHate speech is becoming common. People complain \r\nof being tired of being politically correct. In many \r\nplaces, xenophobia has taken over rational thinking. \r\nIn the vote on Brexit, the spectre of a f lood of Syrian \r\nrefugees was used as the instrument for propelling \r\nthe United Kingdom’s exit from the European Union. \r\nIt is a paradox of our world that nearly 30 years after \r\nPresident Reagan called for the Berlin Wall to be torn \r\ndown, new walls are springing up everywhere.\r\nYet we have the resources in this world to guarantee \r\neach person a decent life. In the implementation of the \r\nMDGs, despite the minimal resources that were injected \r\nby the wealthy nations, we managed by prioritizing \r\nour spending to put more children in school than ever \r\nbefore in history. We managed to pull more than 40 per \r\ncent of the world’s people out of extreme poverty. In \r\nValletta, the European Union put €1.8 billion into \r\nan emergency fund to cooperate with Africa in the \r\ncurbing of unregulated migration, and yet with Africa’s \r\nsignificant share of the world’s arable lands, a youthful \r\nlabour force and a significant share of the world’s \r\nnatural resources, a reordering of economic relations \r\ncould create boundless opportunities that would keep \r\nyoung Africans at home, not risking their lives on these \r\nperilous journeys. Removing subsidies for farmers of \r\nthe advanced world would create an even playing field \r\nfor African farmers to compete. Removing revenue and \r\nnon-revenue barriers to African produce would give \r\nAfrican agriculture a fighting chance.\r\nSome of the young Africans who hazard the \r\ndesert and the Mediterranean Sea to cross to Europe \r\nfrom my country are young poultry farmers or other \r\nentrepreneurs who sell their shops and undertake the \r\njourney because they can no longer compete with the \r\ntons of frozen chicken dumped on African markets \r\nannually, or with the adverse business environment \r\nthey have to face. Africa does not need sympathy or \r\noverseas development assistance. Africans need a fair \r\nchance to trade with the rest of the world and among \r\nourselves.\r\nThe progress towards the creation of a continental \r\nfree-trade area is commendable and must be fast-\r\ntracked. Raising intra-African trade alone from the \r\npaltry average of 15 per cent would create better \r\nopportunities for Africa’s youth. We can achieve a lot \r\nin collaboration with the rest of the world, and yet we \r\nmust realize that a lot also rests within our own capacity \r\nto achieve as Africans. Recently, I took the decision as \r\nPresident of Ghana to allow citizens of other African \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n16/48 16-29421\r\ncountries travelling to Ghana to obtain visas on arrival. \r\nThis would stimulate trade and investment if it were \r\nreplicated across the entire continent.\r\nStructural reforms are required in many areas. \r\nGovernance is also a critical area that requires reform \r\nin Africa. Democracy unleashes the creative juices of \r\nour citizens. Africa has made remarkable progress. \r\nElections are held regularly, civil society groups and \r\nthink tanks have become more vocal, and the media is \r\nincreasingly free. Yet there is a lot more that we can \r\ndo to allow Africans the space to express themselves. \r\nDemocracy is not a one-size-fits-all system; different \r\ncountries are at different stages of the democratic \r\njourney. Democracy evolves and cannot be forced \r\non the people. It does not help for bigger Powers to \r\nproselytize democracy across the continent. It can \r\nhave negative consequences, as we are experiencing in \r\nparts of North Africa and the Middle East. But still, \r\na properly functioning peer system can avoid some of \r\nthe meltdowns we are experiencing in some African \r\ncountries due to a desire to remain in office interminably.\r\nThe mistake with Africa is that we are seen \r\nas a homogenous unit and treated as such. It is not \r\nacknowledged that we are a whole continent with \r\ndifferent aspirations, cultures, democracies and \r\neconomic developments. Human progress is not a \r\nseamless movement forward. It encompasses periods of \r\nreversal, mistakes, fumbling and even falling. All parts \r\nof the world have been through this and learned from \r\ntheir mistakes. They have picked themselves up after a \r\nfall and continued moving. Africa must be allowed the \r\nsame latitude.\r\nA few years ago the term “Africa Rising” \r\npainted a picture of a continent on the move. Recent \r\nheadwinds experienced due to the China slowdown \r\nand the collapse of commodity prices have caused \r\nsome sceptics of Africa to once again gloat about the \r\nnotion that nothing good can come out of the continent. \r\nAfrica is a continent of 54 countries at different stages \r\nof progress and development. There must be room for \r\nus to make our mistakes and learn from them. Africa \r\nhas the potential to be the next continent on the rise. It \r\nhas a lot going for it. The continent has many success \r\nstories. Africa has the fastest growing population, and \r\nthus a very youthful labour force; the fastest growing \r\nmiddle class, with increasing disposable incomes; and \r\nthe fastest growing information and communication \r\ntechnology networks in the world.\r\nAfrica needs strengthened institutions and we are \r\nworking to build them. We must engrain transparency \r\nand integrity more and more into our governance \r\nsystems. President Obama said on his historic visit to \r\nGhana that what Africa needs is strong institutions. \r\nWe must strengthen our institutions of governance to \r\neliminate the incidence of corruption that impoverishes \r\nour people.\r\nMy country, Ghana, is a part of Africa’s success \r\nstory. I am proud of my country. We are variously \r\ncalled the “model of democracy” in Africa or the \r\n“beacon of democracy”. We have not looked back since \r\nthe adoption of our 1992 Constitution. Successive \r\nelections, with power occasionally swinging between \r\nopposing political parties, have established Ghana’s \r\ndemocratic credentials in the world. A strict two-term \r\nlimit for the President guarantees that every eight years \r\na new person will be in charge.\r\nGhana has a fiercely independent media, with \r\nhundreds of newspapers and radio stations. I always say \r\njokingly to my colleagues that in Ghana I have 27 million \r\nPresidents, all of whom know my job better than I do. \r\nEvery morning on the political talk shows across the \r\ncountry, my fellow citizens can be heard coaching me \r\non how to do my job and what my responsibilities are \r\nas President.\r\nBold measures in effecting structural reforms \r\nhave yielded a more stable and resilient economy, with \r\na deficit-to-gross domestic product (GDP) target of \r\n4.9 per cent this year, among other favourable targets. \r\nWith a stable currency, business confidence is rising and \r\nforeign direct investment remains very strong. Ghana \r\nhas been chugging along at a respectable average of \r\nabout 6 per cent GDP growth rate over the past decade. \r\nWith the structural reforms we have undertaken, in \r\ncollaboration with our development partners, and new \r\ndevelopments in our offshore oil and gas prospects, \r\nGhana is predicted to clip along from next year at a \r\nrespectable 8 per cent growth per annum.\r\nOver the past decade, we have invested heavily \r\nin expanding our socioeconomic infrastructure. \r\nInvestments in health care, education, power, water, \r\nroads and ports are yielding significant dividends \r\nfor us and creating more employment opportunities \r\nfor our young people. These investments are yielding \r\ndividends in improved health care, increased enrolment \r\nat all levels of the educational ladder, improved \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 17/48\r\ntransportation systems and the growth of the small and \r\nmedium enterprises.\r\nWith the modest progress we are making, we are \r\nable to recapture the vision of the founder of our nation. \r\nIt is a happy coincidence that on his birth anniversary \r\ntoday, I have the opportunity to address the world from \r\nthe prestigious rostrum of the General Assembly. Today, \r\n21 September, marks the birthday of Kwame Nkrumah. \r\nMany African leaders of our current generation draw \r\ninspiration from him. President Kwame Nkrumah was \r\na champion of African liberation and a staunch Pan-\r\nAfricanist. I wish all my country men and women a \r\nhappy Founder’s Day.\r\nTwo years ago, I stood on this stage (see A/69/PV.9) \r\nand in my capacity as Chair of the Economic Community \r\nof West African States called for urgent action to halt the \r\nspread of the Ebola virus disease, which was ravaging \r\nthree of our West African neighbours and threatening \r\nto spread across the whole subregion. Today, I stand \r\nhere to salute Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and the \r\nUnited Nations for their prompt response in setting \r\nup the United Nations Mission for Ebola Emergency \r\nResponse (UNMEER), which was based in Ghana. \r\nUNMEER will probably go down in the history of \r\nthe United Nations as one of the most successful and \r\neffective missions ever deployed by the Organization. I \r\nalso salute the international community for its effective \r\nresponse in the form of logistics, personnel, medication \r\nand other material that helped to snuff out the disease \r\nin a relatively short time.\r\nMy particular commendation goes to the brave \r\nvolunteers, including 41 of my own countrymen, who \r\nrisked their lives by going into the infection zone to \r\nassist in the fight against the disease. Ghana remains \r\nproud of its contribution towards ending that crisis and \r\nof its support to the United Nations system and the \r\ninternational community when we made our country \r\nthe staging post for the international response and \r\nthe United Nations Mission on the Ebola Emergency \r\nResponse, despite the threats.\r\nFollowing the Ebola response, German Chancellor \r\nAngela Merkel, Norwegian Prime Minister Erna Solberg \r\nand I wrote to the Secretary-General calling for the \r\nestablishment of a high-level panel to prepare a report \r\nthat would allow the world to respond better in times \r\nof such global health crises. We are faced with such a \r\nsituation already in respect of the exponential spread of \r\nthe Zika virus. We must use the lessons learned from \r\nthe Ebola crisis to confront that new threat.\r\nAnother threat we must confront together as a \r\nunited world is the threat of terrorism. No part of the \r\nworld is safe. In our subregion, the activities of Boko \r\nHaram in north-eastern Nigeria and the Lake Chad \r\nBasin have displaced millions of people and claimed \r\nthousands of casualties. Attacks in Mali, Burkina Faso \r\nand Côte d’Ivoire show that all our countries are at risk. \r\nTerrorism is one of the gravest threats to world peace \r\nand security today.\r\nWe cannot be under any illusion about the \r\nimminent threat to all of us even as we go about our \r\ndaily activities. But the solution is not to shut our doors \r\nto foreigners who may have genuine cause for visiting, \r\nincluding tourism, business or sanctuary as refugees. \r\nThat is what the terrorists want to us to do; they seek to \r\ninstil fear and panic in us in order that we shut our doors \r\non the rest of the world. Ghana stands in solidarity with \r\nall countries that have experienced terrorism recently: \r\nBangladesh, Belgium, France, Germany, Indonesia, \r\nLebanon, Pakistan, the Russian Federation, Turkey and \r\nthe United States of America. No, we must not give in \r\nto them. The terrorists must not win, they cannot win \r\nand they will not win.\r\nI wish to commend the United States and Cuba for \r\nthe progress made in thawing the relations between \r\nthe two neighbours. We have all been watching with \r\nexcitement the removal of some of the last vestiges of \r\nthe Cold War with the reopening of embassies in the \r\ntwo capitals, President Obama’s historic visit and the \r\nresumption of f lights between the two countries. The \r\ntime has come to take the remaining steps to completely \r\nlift the blockade on Cuba. I hope that this can be \r\nachieved before President Obama’s Administration \r\nleaves office.\r\nGhana once again wishes to reiterate its support for \r\na two-State solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \r\nThere is no military solution to this conflict. Israel’s \r\nsecurity can be guaranteed only by a peaceful and stable \r\nPalestinian State coexisting side by side with Israel. \r\nUnfortunately, the illegal occupation of Palestinian \r\nlands continues to make such a solution more and more \r\ndifficult to attain.\r\nLast September, we convened in this very Hall \r\nand made a commitment to implementing the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. It is an ambitious \r\nyet achievable Agenda whose Goals and Targets go \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n18/48 16-29421\r\nfar beyond the imperatives of economic growth by \r\ntackling the root causes of poverty and deprivation and \r\ndelivering on the social and environmental dimensions \r\nof development. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment not only marks the beginning of a new \r\nand even more promising phase in our trajectory as a \r\nglobal body, but also challenges us to develop new and \r\ninnovative partnerships that I believe will guarantee \r\nprogress evenly across regions and for all people. The 17 \r\nGoals and 169 Targets underscore the underlying values \r\nof the United Nations, as enshrined in its Charter, and \r\nprovide renewed impetus to its activities in sustaining \r\npeace, preserving our planet, ensuring socioeconomic \r\njustice and safeguarding the dignity of mankind.\r\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the \r\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-\r\n2030, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on Financing \r\nfor Development and the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals represent four important, mutually reinforcing \r\nlandmark agreements that open a new chapter in global \r\ndevelopment towards ensuring prosperity for our people \r\nand preserving our planet.\r\nI am impressed by the level of commitment that the \r\nUnited States and China, two of the major emitters of \r\ngreenhouse gases, have shown by agreeing to ratify the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change. I hope that this \r\nwill be the catalyst that brings the Agreement into force, \r\nand state that we, as a generation, are unequivocally \r\ncommitted to bequeathing a better world to future \r\ngenerations. We must not fail to do this. As leaders, we \r\nare also responsible for moving beyond setting norms \r\nto delivering on our commitments at the national, \r\nregional and global levels. If we do not achieve them all \r\nsimultaneously, it must not be for want of effort.\r\nI am particularly honoured to co-chair the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s advocacy group in support of the SDGs. While \r\nwe acknowledge that national leadership and ownership \r\nare critical, global partnerships are needed for financial \r\nresources, policy advice and technical assistance. I am \r\nhappy to inform you, Mr. President, that Ghana has \r\nbegun work in earnest to implement the SDGs. We will \r\nestablish the necessary national structures to ensure \r\nthat the policies and measures taken in that regard fall \r\nin line with our 40-year development plan, currently \r\nbeing formulated. I have also signed the ratification \r\ninstrument of the Paris Agreement and will take part in \r\nthe event today depositing Ghana’s instrument with the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Security Council remains an important source \r\nof legitimacy for international action on peace and \r\nsecurity. While Africa accounts for close to one third \r\nof the membership of the United Nations and nearly two \r\nthirds of the work of the Council, it remains woefully \r\nunderrepresented in the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategory. Eleven long years after the African Union \r\nadopted the Ezulwini Consensus, we are nowhere near \r\nachieving a more equitable reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. That will continue to remain a scar on the \r\nconscience of this world body if not remedied as quickly \r\nas possible.\r\nGhana is a leading democracy in Africa. I stand \r\nbefore the world today to declare that, just as we have \r\ndone in the past, my country will go to the polls this \r\nDecember, and the processes before, during and after \r\nwill mark a further consolidation of Ghana’s credentials \r\nas a leading world democracy.\r\nIn conclusion, let me once again express my sincere \r\nappreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his extraordinary \r\nleadership during his tenure as Secretary-General. The \r\npeople of Ghana, my wife and I wish the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and Mrs. Ban Soon-taek well in their future \r\nendeavours. It is my wish that history record our time \r\nhere in this Hall as one that gave reality to Michael \r\nJackson’s song: “heal the world/make the world a better \r\nplace for you and for me/and for the entire human race.”\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Ghana \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. John Dramani Mahama, President of the \r\nRepublic of Ghana, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Sarwar Danesh, Vice-President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Vice-President of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Afghanistan.\r\nMr. Sarwar Danesh, Vice-President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sarwar Danesh, Vice-President of \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 19/48\r\nthe Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Danesh (Afghanistan) (spoke in Dari; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): It is my distinct \r\npleasure to attend the seventy-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I sincerely congratulate Ambassador \r\nPeter Thomson of the Republic of Fiji on having been \r\nelected to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nthis session. I thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his tireless efforts and wise leadership in support \r\nof fundamental freedoms, the rule of law and justice \r\nfor all over a decade. We wish him every success in his \r\nfuture endeavours.\r\nThe twenty-first century has brought with it an \r\never-complex international arena, in which certain old \r\nconflicts have lingered and been exacerbated, while \r\nnew threats and challenges — in the form of violent \r\nextremism and terrorism, displacement and migration, \r\nclimate change and other challenges — have emerged, \r\nthreatening all of humankind. We have come to realize \r\nthat dialogue and cooperation provide the most viable \r\navenue to promote peace and security and ensure a \r\nworld without hatred and conflict.\r\nWe believe that the United Nations remains the \r\nsingle most important international body for promoting \r\nglobal peace, security and prosperity, and that achieving \r\na stronger Organization remains a priority for all of us \r\nin the way forward. The United Nations vital role in \r\nhelping Afghanistan to transition into a democratic and \r\npluralistic society is a clear example of its profound \r\nimpact in helping to create real change for bettering \r\nsocieties and communities around the world. Allow me \r\nto update the Assembly on the current state of affairs \r\nin my country.\r\nWhile two years have passed since the establishment \r\nof the Government of National Unity of Afghanistan, \r\nI would like to briefly present an overview of the \r\nachievements of my Government under the leadership \r\nof Mr. Mohammad Ashraf Ghani Ahmadzai, the elected \r\nPresident of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. We \r\nin Afghanistan aim to strengthen the spirit of national \r\nparticipation and cooperation so as to take into account \r\nthe wishes and will Afghan citizens. Based on national \r\nconsensus, all groups, political figures and Afghan elites \r\ninside and outside the Government are jointly sharing \r\nideas now how to strengthen the political system and \r\nthe Government of National Unity and to implement \r\nreforms within the framework of our national interests.\r\nThe Afghan nation has inherited a legacy of \r\nconflict, oppression, discrimination and inequality. \r\nWe believe that democracy is the best solution to these \r\nproblems, as it provides the only foundation to ensure \r\njustice and equality and to enable social and political \r\ngroups to be adequately represented. We have a modern \r\nConstitution that provides for this goal, and only its \r\nfull implementation can ensure political stability in \r\nour society.\r\nOur Government has registered considerable \r\nachievements in different areas over the past two years, \r\nincluding in reducing maternal and child mortality, \r\nincreasing access to education, improving basic \r\nfreedoms, strengthening the telecommunications and \r\ninformation sectors, improving the rule of law and \r\npreserving justice and human rights. Internationally, \r\nour Government enjoys its due status, having proved \r\nto be a trustworthy partner to the many countries that \r\nare engaged in Afghanistan and invested in the security \r\nand stability of the country.\r\nWe are sparing no effort to implement our \r\ncommitments to reform. We are pursuing our well-\r\nplanned and systematic efforts to eliminate corruption, \r\nstrengthen good governance, undertake judicial reform, \r\npromote women’s empowerment, ensure effective \r\nservice delivery for our citizens and accountability \r\nstandards at all levels of Government, institutionalize \r\nmerit-based appointments of senior officials and \r\nsecure transparency in Government contracts, with the \r\nestablishment of the National Procurement Authority.\r\nIn order to strengthen transparency of our future \r\nparliamentary, presidential and district council \r\nelections, the process of consultations and technical \r\nand legal studies on reforming our electoral bodies and \r\nlaws have been concluded, and initial steps towards \r\nelectoral reforms will begin very soon.\r\nCombating the threat of narcotics is another priority \r\nof the National Unity Government. In this regard, we \r\nare cooperating closely with United Nations Office \r\non Drugs and Crime and other international partners, \r\nand will maintain our joint efforts within the national \r\naction plan framework.\r\nAt the 2016 NATO Warsaw Summit in July, NATO \r\nmembers and our other allies pledged to provide \r\n$1 billion in support on an annual basis for the Afghan \r\nNational Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF) until \r\nthe end of 2020. The Resolute Support Mission, which \r\noffers support in training, advice and assistance to \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n20/48 16-29421\r\nANDSF, was also extended beyond 2016. We extend \r\na particular debt of gratitude to the United States of \r\nAmerica for providing the largest share of support.\r\nIn less than two weeks time, Afghanistan and \r\nour international partners will come together at the \r\nBrussels Conference on Afghanistan to review, and \r\nreach important decisions on, the full scope of the \r\njoint partnership in the way forward. The National \r\nUnity Government will present a comprehensive \r\nupdate on the positive trajectory of our reform efforts, \r\nconducted on the basis of the Self-Reliance through \r\nMutual Accountability Framework. We look forward \r\nto our international partners making new pledges of \r\nassistance on the basis of Afghanistan’s National Peace \r\nand Development Framework.\r\nDespite these achievements, the ongoing \r\nundeclared war against Afghanistan and the need for \r\nsecurity remain a serious challenge for the National \r\nUnity Government, as our people are still subject to the \r\nmerciless attacks of terrorist groups. Currently, more \r\nthan 10 terrorist groups, sent from outside the country \r\nwith the goal of impeding our State-building efforts \r\nand preventing the establishment of peace and stability, \r\nare fighting against us in Afghanistan. One of their \r\nmain objectives is to suppress democracy, freedom of \r\nspeech, and our free and independent media. That is \r\nwhy our journalists are subject to serious threats while \r\nreporting from the battlefields and during terrorist \r\nattacks. Afghanistan asks the United Nations to appoint \r\na special representative for the safety of journalists, \r\nfocused on protecting all journalists, including those \r\nserving in Afghanistan.\r\nOver the past several months, terrorist groups, \r\nincluding the Taliban and Da’esh, which continue to \r\nenjoy foreign support, have attacked a peaceful and \r\ncivil demonstration of the Enlightenment Movement in \r\nDeh Mazang square in Kabul, and killed dozens of our \r\neducated youth and elite. They have also attacked the \r\nAmerican University of Afghanistan and other civilian \r\nfacilities, killing hundreds of innocent civilians. Based \r\non existing evidence, these attacks were planned and \r\norganized from the other side of the Durand Line, \r\ninside Pakistani territory.\r\nThis year, the Taliban has tried to take control of \r\nmore areas in the country, especially in Kunduz and \r\nHelmand provinces, but have been confronted by the \r\nANDSF. As a result, hundreds of extremist militants \r\nof the Taliban and Da’esh, many of whom were \r\nforeign fighters, were killed or captured. We call on \r\nthe international community to focus on eliminating \r\nterrorist safe havens located outside of the country. We \r\nurge States to honestly implement their international \r\npledges in the fight against terrorism and to avoid the \r\ndual policy of distinguishing between good and bad \r\nterrorists, which undermines the international order.\r\nWhere were the previous leaders of the Taliban \r\nand Al-Qaeda residing, and where were they killed? At \r\nthis very moment, where are the leaders of the Taliban \r\nand the Haqqani network located? Where and how \r\nare terrorists being trained, equipped and financed to \r\nwage a full-scale war? We have repeatedly asked our \r\nneighboring country Pakistan to destroy the known \r\nterrorist safe havens, but we have unfortunately yet to \r\nwitness any change in the situation. Afghanistan has \r\nalways desired peaceful relations with all countries \r\nof the region, but the Government of National Unity \r\nreserves the right to do whatever is necessary to defend \r\nand protect our people.\r\nWe have also kept the doors of peace and \r\nnegotiations open to those Taliban elements and other \r\narmed opposition groups that are willing to renounce \r\nviolence, return to peaceful life and adhere to our \r\nConstitution. In this connection, a peace agreement is \r\nabout to be signed between our Government and the \r\nHezb-e-Islami party. That will be an important step for \r\nprogress in our peace process.\r\nWe believe that the Quadrilateral Coordination \r\nGroup on the Afghan Peace and Reconciliation \r\nProcess — composed of Afghanistan, the People’s \r\nRepublic of China, Pakistan and the United States — can \r\nremain a useful platform to further peace efforts so \r\nlong as the Government of Pakistan acts in good faith to \r\nmeet and fulfil its commitments within the parameters \r\nof the Group’s road map.\r\nDespite our security challenges, Afghanistan has \r\nalways maintained a positive approach to our relations \r\nwith all regional countries and the Islamic world. We \r\nconsider Islamic countries to be our best partners and \r\nseek to strengthen our cultural, social and economic \r\nties and to use our experience to promote peace and \r\ncoexistence and present a moderate interpretation of \r\nIslam. In this regard, we welcome the express readiness \r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Cooperation and \r\nany Islamic country to help promote the peace agenda \r\nin Afghanistan. I would add that Islam is a religion \r\nwith a clear thought, culture, civilization and history \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 21/48\r\nthat respects human dignity, rights and freedoms, and \r\nderives national sovereignty from the will of the people. \r\nIt is also against any kind of injustice, exclusivism, \r\nhatred, radicalism and violence.\r\nThose individuals and groups that resort to violence, \r\nterror and killing under any name are not acquainted with \r\nthe spirit of this humane religion, and are in fact using \r\nIslam only as a tool to achieve their evil goals. How can \r\nIslam possibly permit terrorism and suicide attacks, or \r\nthe taking of the lives of thousands of innocent people, \r\nwhen it clearly considers the human individual to be the \r\nrepresentative of God on Earth, assigning him dignity \r\nand offering him heavenly insight in the holy verses \r\nof the Quran? Islam also considers the killing of one \r\ninnocent human to be equal to killing all humankind. \r\nWe expect the prominent Islamic scholars who will \r\nsoon take part in an important conference in the holy \r\ncity of Mecca to further elucidate the true image of \r\nIslam and declare their condemnation of terrorists and \r\nextremists on behalf of our great religion.\r\nIn order to achieve regional cooperation, we need \r\na stable region. Afghanistan’s foreign policy is founded \r\non the creation of a secure economy-based society. \r\nAfghanistan is an active member of the South Asian \r\nAssociation for Regional Cooperation and the European \r\nCommunity Humanitarian Office, as well an observer \r\nmember of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, \r\nand seeks to play an active role in the revitalization of \r\nthe Regional Cooperation Agenda within the Heart of \r\nAsia-Istanbul Process.\r\nAfghanistan and all countries of its region share \r\ncommon threats and common interests. We should come \r\ntogether and cooperate in the fight against our common \r\nthreats, which include terrorism, radicalism, drugs, \r\norganized crime, illegal immigration and smuggling. \r\nThe establishment of a regional railroad, energy transit, \r\nmine extraction, trade and transportation infrastructure \r\ncan provide us with an important opportunity for joint \r\neconomic cooperation.\r\nAfghanistan, as an important crossroads for trade, \r\ntransport and economic activities, can connect South \r\nAsia to Central Asia, and the Middle East to East and \r\nSouth Asia. Afghanistan has already made significant \r\nprogress through projects such as the Turkmenistan-\r\nAfghanistan-Pakistan-India Pipeline; the Central Asia \r\nSouth Asia Electricity Transmission and Trade Project; \r\nthe Lapis Lazuli Corridor; a railway corridor between \r\nChina, Iran, Afghanistan and Central Asia; and \r\nextended cooperation with Iran regarding Chabahar \r\nPort. The implementation of these projects will allow \r\nAfghanistan to reach international markets and improve \r\nconnections between the regional countries.\r\nWith respect to the principles of non-interference \r\nin the affairs of other countries; avoiding the use \r\nof force in the resolution of conflicts; respect for \r\nterritorial integrity and national sovereignty; the \r\nexchange of knowledge, science and technology; and, \r\nmost importantly, the promotion of peace and lasting \r\nsecurity and stability, we can prepare for the economic \r\ngrowth of all countries of our region. We therefore call \r\non all our neighbouring countries to cooperate with us \r\nin the provision of security and stability throughout the \r\nregion.\r\nIn November 1946, Afghanistan was the first \r\ncountry to become a United Nations Member State \r\nafter the 51 founding countries, and since then it has \r\nsolemnly adhered to its international commitments. \r\nOver the past 16 years, we have served as a point of \r\nconvergence at which the international community \r\nhas been able to come together. In this regard and on \r\nbehalf of the Afghan nation, I also wish to highlight \r\nand thank the United Nations for the central role it has \r\nplayed in facilitating effective international support \r\nfor the stability and prosperity of Afghanistan. In \r\nrecent years, we have signed documents for long-term \r\nstrategic cooperation with 20 of our allies, including the \r\nUnited States, the European Union and NATO, which \r\nhave announced their valuable support for the policies \r\nand decisions of the Afghan Government at important \r\nconferences in Bonn, Tokyo, London, Chicago and \r\nWarsaw.\r\nAfghanistan, like other members of the international \r\ncommunity, is serious and resolute in its fight against \r\nradicalism and violence and will continue to battle this \r\nominous phenomenon. For years, our nation has been \r\non the front line of the fight against terrorism and has \r\nmade tremendous sacrifices in defence of the common \r\nvalues of humanity. We have lost many of our great \r\nnational figures, including the martyrs Ahmad Shah \r\nMassoud, Ustad Burhanuddin Rabbani, Ustad Abdul \r\nAli Mazari and Abdul Haq, as well as hundreds of \r\nulamas, Members of Parliament, officers, journalists \r\nand members of our political elites.\r\nWe believe that terrorism and radicalism have \r\nbecome global threats to world peace. We have seen \r\nsigns of radicalism emerge in different forms throughout \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n22/48 16-29421\r\nEurope and America and incidents of terrorist attacks \r\nin many countries around the world. Given the extent \r\nof these threats, the measures taken by the international \r\ncommunity in the fight against terrorism and radicalism \r\nwill never be sufficient or successful unless effective, \r\ncomprehensive measures encompassing political, \r\ncultural, economic and even military aspects are \r\nconsidered to be a universal strategic necessity.\r\nMs. Kasese-Bota (Zambia), Vice-President, re-\r\nturned to the Chair.\r\nThe United Nations should hold an international \r\nconference on the fight against radicalism with the \r\naim of introducing a new legal framework to combat \r\nterrorism. We believe that serious efforts in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism and radicalism require thorough and \r\nprecise planning for at least 20 years. Afghanistan, \r\nwhich is on the front line of this fight, should receive \r\nspecial attention from the international community in \r\nthis regard.\r\nOne of the ominous outcomes of violence and \r\nradicalism is the new wave of immigration over the past \r\nyear, which has emerged as an important international \r\nchallenge. We thank those countries that offer support \r\nto Afghan immigrants, especially Germany and other \r\nEuropean countries that have welcomed Afghan \r\nrefugees with open arms and a humane, loving spirit. \r\nWe also ask the United Nations and its Member States \r\nto take a new approach towards this international \r\nchallenge and help countries of origin to address the \r\nroot causes of and reasons for immigration, particularly \r\nthe ominous phenomena of war, poverty and illiteracy.\r\nA glimpse into global conditions shows that \r\ninjustice, threat, violence and conflict are still \r\nendangering millions of human lives throughout the \r\nworld. We have seen devastation and terror in Syria. \r\nWe announce our full support for a comprehensive \r\nsolution to the Syrian conflict that reflects the will of \r\nall Syrians. We also hope to see a comprehensive and \r\npeaceful solution to the conflict in Yemen.\r\nWe support new international efforts to resolve \r\nthe issue of Palestine and to provide the brave and \r\nnoble Palestinian people with their legitimate rights, \r\nincluding the right to have an independent Government. \r\nWe invite all sides to initiate direct talks so as to achieve \r\na sustainable solution based on the principles of peace \r\nand peaceful coexistence.\r\nAfghanistan supports the historic agreement \r\nbetween the 5+1 countries and the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran on the Iranian nuclear programme within the \r\nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action, and views the \r\nimplementation of the agreement as constructive \r\nfor the restoration of peace, stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment in the region and the world. With regard \r\nto nuclear programmes, I should add that we believe \r\nthat the Democratic Republic of North Korea’s tests of \r\nnuclear weapons are dangerous for the region and can \r\nendanger world peace and security.\r\nSince 2001, when it began a new chapter of its \r\nmodern history, Afghanistan has regained its historical \r\nplace among the responsible members of the family of \r\nnations represented in the General Assembly. Through \r\nwords and deeds, we have shown our full and abiding \r\ncommitment to upholding the principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and played our due role in \r\npromoting global peace, justice, human rights and the \r\nrule of law. It is in that context that we have presented \r\nour candidacy to the Human Rights Council for 2018-\r\n2020. We call respectfully and amicably on all our \r\nfriends and Member States to support our candidacy in \r\nthe upcoming election.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to reiterate, on behalf of the \r\nAfghan people and Government, our deepest gratitude \r\nto all our international partners that have stood beside \r\nus in our quest for peace, security and prosperity over \r\nthe past 16 years, and I especially thank the troops of \r\nNATO and the International Security Assistance Force \r\nfor the sacrifices they have made in the fight against \r\nterrorism in Afghanistan. Together, we have come a \r\nlong way in our journey, but our task is undoubtedly \r\nunfinished. We look to the Assembly’s continued \r\nsupport over the coming years and remain confident in \r\nrealizing the goals that we have jointly set to achieve.\r\nI wish to highlight once again Afghanistan’s firm \r\ncommitment to the realization of a world in which \r\npeace, harmony, justice and tranquillity prevail.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Afghanistan for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Sarwar Danesh, Vice-President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Afghanistan, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 23/48\r\nAddress by Mr. Donald Tusk, President of the \r\nEuropean Council\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will hear a \r\nstatement by the President of the European Council.\r\nMr. Donald Tusk, President of the European \r\nCouncil, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Donald Tusk, President \r\nof the European Council, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Tusk (European Council): Last year, I stood \r\nhere to assure the General Assembly that isolationism \r\nwill never be Europe’s policy (see A/71/PV.16). I have \r\nnot changed my mind, even though the past 12 months \r\nhave been difficult, not least for the European Union \r\n(EU). Europe will always stand for a free and open \r\nworld governed by the rule of law, in which nations can \r\ntrade and grow together, instead of living in conflict, \r\nmistrust and intrigue. We treat the values upon which \r\nthe European Union is founded in all seriousness and \r\nwe have the determination to seek those values in the \r\ninternational arena. If we fail, the world will descend \r\ninto greater disorder, and the first victims are always \r\nthe weakest and the poorest.\r\nThis Organization is in the process of choosing \r\nnew leadership. That gives us an opportunity to reflect \r\nfrankly on the kind of international system that we \r\nhave today and the one that we want for the future. \r\nAs a historian, I know why the League of Nations \r\nfailed in its mission to protect peace and international \r\nsecurity. It was paralysed by inertia, fatalism and, \r\nfinally, by cowardice. As a politician, I can see similar \r\nphenomena everywhere today. That is owing to the \r\nrise of fear — the fear of war, terrorism and strangers. \r\nGlobalization makes fear more contagious and more \r\npotent. It dangerously links together the anxieties of the \r\nMiddle East, Africa, Asia, Europe and America. One \r\nexample, among others, is that of the radical Islam of \r\nDa’esh, which spreads terror from Jakarta to Nice, from \r\nTunis to Brussels, from Sirte to Orlando.\r\nWhen fear takes over, nations increasingly turn \r\naway from one another. What we need to do here and \r\nnow is regain a sense of security, which is a fundamental \r\nneed for every human being, as important as the need \r\nfor freedom. No challenge shows that as clearly as the \r\nissue of refugee protection and the mass displacement \r\nof persons across borders. Over the past several months, \r\nEurope has been confronted by the refugee crisis to \r\na particularly large degree. Nevertheless, in all our \r\nactions aimed at solving the problem of refugees, the \r\nEuropean Union is driven by empathy and the readiness \r\nto offer help to those in need, even if the world turns \r\nits back and pretends not to see. And still today, when \r\nwe restore order on our external borders and take back \r\ncontrol from the smugglers, the readiness to assist \r\nrefugees in their plight remains our top priority.\r\nThat is why we have spent billions of euros to fund \r\nhumanitarian assistance and are willing to spend much \r\nmore in the months and years to come. It is our hope \r\nand expectation that global solidarity will now kick in \r\nto provide health, education and jobs for millions of \r\npeople currently displaced and scale up resettlement. \r\nIn the light of that, we support the work that has now \r\nbegun under the New York Declaration for Refugees \r\nand Migrants (resolution 71/1) to find a sustainable and \r\nfair rule book for global migration. The Declaration \r\ngives us hope that the principles that have been at the \r\nheart of our response will also form the foundation of \r\nthe global response to the refugee crisis.\r\nEurope is and will be active everywhere that \r\nwar is imminent or is already raging. Our main goal \r\nwill always be peace. That as true for civil wars in \r\nthe Middle East or Africa as it is for nuclear testing \r\nand territorial disputes in Asia. It is also true on our \r\nown borders on which Ukraine has been attacked by \r\nRussia. Further afield, what now concerns us are the \r\nconflicts in Syria, Libya and Afghanistan, in which the \r\nvery statehood of those countries is in danger. We fully \r\nsupport and stand ready to engage in the work of the \r\nUnited Nations to bring parties to the negotiating table \r\nin Syria and in Libya. And in a few weeks, together \r\nwith the Afghan Government, the European Union \r\nwill host an international conference in Brussels. It is \r\na unique opportunity for the rest of the world to show \r\nthat it cares about supporting a stable Afghanistan and \r\nthe stability of the region as a whole.\r\nThis year, we have also witnessed a rising wave \r\nof terror worldwide, including against the people of \r\nEurope, carried out by many terrorist organizations, \r\nin particular by Da’esh. Building a global strategy \r\nand network against terrorism is key, including in \r\npreventing radicalization and confronting the issues \r\nof foreign fighters and terrorist financing. Europe is \r\nworking with partners from Asia to the Gulf and the \r\nSahel on building up global capacities against violent \r\nextremism. We are upgrading our borders to ensure that \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n24/48 16-29421\r\nterrorists cannot pass or re-enter and are working with \r\ncommunities to prevent young people from becoming \r\ninfected with hatred. This threat will touch all of us \r\nsooner or later, which is why we should make better use \r\nof the United Nations to fight it together.\r\nThe European Union is the world’s largest donor \r\nof development and humanitarian aid, and that will \r\nnot change. The Sustainable Development Goals can \r\ndrive reform of the international system by offering \r\nan opportunity to address many problems in one \r\nprocess — insecurity, poverty, underdevelopment, \r\nclimate change and uncontrolled migration. And, \r\nultimately, we seek a system that ensures that everybody \r\ngets his or her fair share of the benefits of globalization.\r\nLastly, I would like to say a word about the \r\nfight against climate change, to which the EU is \r\nfully committed. Europe has had a comprehensive \r\nclimate-change policy in place for years. Right now \r\nwe are developing laws that will allow us to reach our \r\nambitious target for 2030, and our ratification of the \r\nParis accord will be completed soon. The fact that the \r\ntwo biggest global emitters have ratified the agreement \r\nearly is a positive sign. It shows that the readiness to \r\ntake responsibility for our common future is not limited \r\nonly to Europe. I am hopeful that this trend will become \r\ncontagious.\r\nLet me say one more thing at the end: I feel that \r\nordinary people sense that a great change is coming. \r\nWe should listen. We should understand. We should \r\nanticipate, not just react. Our job is to bring back a \r\nsense of direction, to bring back confidence, to bring \r\nback a sense of order. Globalization needs credible \r\nrules to make it stable and fair, whether we are talking \r\nabout trade, migration or security.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the European \r\nCouncil for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Donald Tusk, President of the European \r\nCouncil, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Petro Poroshenko, President \r\nof Ukraine\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of Ukraine.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Petro Poroshenko, President \r\nof Ukraine, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Poroshenko: On behalf of Ukraine, \r\nI sincerely congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session. I pledge Ukraine’s full support \r\nfor all of his endeavours.\r\nIn one of the worst years of the twentieth century, \r\nErnest Hemingway wrote an inspiring humanistic \r\nnovel. In the epigraph to the novel, he quoted the \r\nEnglish poet John Donne:\r\n“No man is an island,\r\nEntire of itself,\r\nEvery man is a piece of the continent,\r\nA part of the main;\r\n …\r\nAny man’s death diminishes me,\r\nBecause I am involved in mankind”.\r\nThese words embodied the essence of the moral and \r\nhistorical transformation that humankind underwent in \r\nthe wake of the two world wars of the twentieth century.\r\nWe entered the third millennium with a strong, new \r\nsense of being united, as a humankind for which there \r\nis no such thing as “someone else’s pain”. What has \r\nhappened to this feeling? Where has it gone? Where \r\nhas the drive to isolate oneself on an island come from? \r\nWhy is it that new politicians come to power on various \r\ncontinents calling for ignoring someone else’s pain? \r\nWhy is it that a cynicism not seen since the time of \r\nHemingway’s novel has settled into our lives under the \r\nguise of pragmatism? What makes evil so strong and \r\ngood so weak nowadays?\r\n“No man is an island” — this is also about those \r\nin power.\r\nThis is also about our Organization.\r\nToday the world is experiencing greater and greater \r\ninstability. Some have been affected more, some less. But \r\nnever since the end of the Cold War have international \r\nnorms and principles been unilaterally defied on such a \r\nscale and with such brutality. The Charter of the United \r\nNations, the document underpinning our responsibility \r\nfor maintaining the world order, has never before been \r\nquestioned. And never before has a Security Council \r\nmember been a major violator of the United Nations \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 25/48\r\nCharter while at the same time being the instigator \r\nof, and an active participant in, a conflict, as well as \r\nits mediator.\r\nAs a result, global instability is no longer the subject \r\nof academic debate but is actually the greatest threat \r\nfacing humankind nowadays. Our future, the future of \r\nour children and our Organization, depend directly on \r\nhow we manage to overcome this threat.\r\nI see only two ways out of this situation: either we \r\nrecognize the problem and spare no effort to address \r\nit on the basis of shared values and principles, or we \r\ndeceive ourselves with the illusion of stability, turn a \r\nblind eye to obvious facts and leave the future of the \r\nUnited Nations — this unique platform for common \r\naction — at the mercy of one player that blatantly \r\nviolates the United Nations Charter.\r\nIf we choose the second option, we will soon \r\nexperience severe disappointment.\r\nThe price for this short-sightedness has long been \r\nknown: it is human lives. In the last century, humankind \r\npaid an enormous price following the two World Wars: \r\nabout 70 million lives. Is that not enough?\r\nHence, I wish to reiterate that we can no longer \r\nafford to have the Security Council deadlocked on key \r\nissues of international peace and security. Limiting the \r\nuse of the veto power in decision-making on conflict \r\nprevention and resolution should become a priority \r\ntask in the context of Security Council reform. The \r\nsuspension of the use of veto in cases of mass atrocities, \r\nas well as in cases in which a Security Council member \r\nState is a party to a dispute, should become a rock-solid \r\nrule, without exceptions. The Council must become a \r\ntruly democratic and representative body free from the \r\nrelics of the past.\r\nThere is a critical need to make our Organization \r\ncapable of addressing effectively acts of aggression \r\nand of bringing those responsible to justice. Otherwise, \r\nno nation, no State Member of the United Nations can \r\nenjoy sustainable security and development.\r\nAnother threat to international peace and security \r\nthat requires the urgent attention of the world \r\ncommunity is hybrid wars. As President of a State that \r\nhas become a testing ground for new methods of hybrid \r\nwarfare, I have already drawn international attention to \r\nthis threat at the previous session of the Assembly.\r\nOver the past year, the practice of hybrid warfare \r\nhas only spread. Its effect has been seen across all of \r\nEurope, the United States of America and beyond. \r\nPolitical pressure, blatant propaganda, interference \r\nwith the electoral process, economic coercion, secret \r\nsubversive and military operation, cyberattacks, \r\nmisuse of diplomatic measures — these are modern \r\nunconventional methods of undeclared war. It is time for \r\nthe Security Council to work resolutely and effectively \r\non this issue. Ukraine is ready to further discuss what \r\nthe Council can do to tackle this threat, and how it can \r\ndo so.\r\nIn view of the recent developments on the Korean \r\npeninsula, the future of the nuclear non-proliferation \r\nregime is a cause of increased concern for my country. \r\nAs is well known, Ukraine voluntarily dismantled its \r\nown nuclear arsenal — the third largest in the world at \r\nthe time, with between 2,800 and 4,200 tactical nuclear \r\nwarheads — in exchange for security, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity assurances under the 1994 Budapest \r\nMemorandum on Security Assurances. Regrettably, all \r\nthese assurances remained exclusively on paper. Let me \r\nbe frank: we failed to pass the exam with the Budapest \r\nMemorandum. The democratic world lost its first battle \r\nat that time. It was not only about Ukraine, but also \r\nabout the credibility of all agreements.\r\nHowever, Ukraine, as a responsible international \r\nactor, has always been and remains a committed \r\nadvocate of nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament. \r\nThus, the timely and effective action of the international \r\ncommunity — the Security Council in the first \r\nplace — in response to the North Korean nuclear test \r\nis one more exam for all of us. We must not allow the \r\nworld to plunge into a new nuclear arms race. Huge \r\nglobal instability and ever-growing security challenges \r\nincreasingly demand strong leadership both in States \r\nand in international organizations. The United Nations \r\nis no exception.\r\nThis year, we will appoint the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I believe that the candidate for this important \r\nposition, in addition to his or her highly professional \r\nskills, must be uncompromising on respect for the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and ready to decisively \r\nuse all tools at his or her disposal, including those \r\nprovided under Article 99 of the Charter, in case of a \r\nthreat to peace and security. We expect that both the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly will make \r\nthe right choice. Ukraine, as a current non-permanent \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n26/48 16-29421\r\nmember of the Security Council, will work consistently \r\nto this end.\r\nThis year, we have witnessed a gruesome series of \r\nterrorist attacks in Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Burkina \r\nFaso, Turkey, Belgium, France, Germany and Ukraine. \r\nThis list is unfortunately not even complete. The \r\ntentacles of terrorism are wrapping themselves around \r\nmore countries and continents. It is obvious that such \r\na large-scale threat can be confronted effectively only \r\nthrough joint efforts. In this context, the protection \r\nof crucial infrastructure from terrorist attacks should \r\nbecome our joint endeavour. Banking and finance, \r\ntelecommunications, emergency services, air and \r\nrailway transportation, and energy and water supply \r\nwill all be put at risk. Even worse, terrorist attacks may \r\nclaim numerous victims among civilian populations.\r\nWe will continue calling for the Security Council’s \r\naction in response to this growing problem. In this \r\nregard, we welcome the initiative of the United \r\nKingdom to convene a Security Council ministerial \r\nmeeting to discuss terrorist threats to aviation security \r\n(see S/PV. 7775). This should be a powerful signal that \r\nthe Council is ready to act resolutely to prevent future \r\ntragedies — tragedies such as the downing by terrorists \r\nof Malaysian Airlines Flight MH-17 over the Donbas \r\ntwo years ago.\r\nThe scrupulous technical investigation carried \r\nout by an international team made it possible not only \r\nto uncover details but also to put together the whole \r\npicture of this horrible crime. Now we have to ensure \r\nthe proper implementation of the Security Council \r\nresolution 2166 (2014), regardless of Russia’s shameful \r\nveto of the decision to establish an international \r\ntribunal under the aegis of the United Nations. The \r\njoint team — composed of representatives from \r\nMalaysia, the Netherlands, Australia, Belgium and \r\nUkraine — continues the criminal investigation. We \r\nmust set up an efficient mechanism to bring to justice \r\nall those responsible for this catastrophe. Our moral \r\nduty is to ensure that not only the perpetrators but also \r\nthe masterminds of this crime, whose orders killed 298 \r\ninnocent people, are punished appropriately for what \r\nthey did.\r\nSince 2014, Ukraine has learned from its own \r\ntragic experience what foreign-grown terrorism feels \r\nlike. The terrorist component of the undeclared hybrid \r\nwarfare that Russia has waged against Ukraine is \r\nevident. Dramatically, it has become a daily routine in \r\nthe occupied areas of the Donetsk and Luhansk regions \r\nof Ukraine. For over two years, Ukraine has received \r\nextensive and irrefutable evidence of the direct \r\ninvolvement of Russia, its State agencies and officials \r\nin financing, sponsoring, and coordinating terrorist \r\ngroups that have committed countless crimes against \r\nmy compatriots.\r\nThe shocking reality is that there is an illegal \r\nmilitary force of roughly 38,000 in Donbas, and a \r\nlarge part of that is irregulars and mercenaries from \r\nRussia. This force is armed to the teeth by Russia. That \r\nis no exaggeration. They have at their disposal some \r\n700 tanks, 1,200 armoured vehicles, more than 1,000 \r\nartilery systems and more than 300 multiple-launch \r\nrocket systems. Russia keeps sending weapons, \r\nammunition and manpower to Ukraine through the \r\nuncontrolled part of the Ukrainian-Russian border by \r\nroad and by rail on a daily basis.\r\nAt the same time, the Russian side continues to \r\ninsist at all forums, including here at the United Nations, \r\nthat it has nothing to do with all of this and that the \r\nRussians are not in Ukraine. No. They are there and \r\neven hypocritical Soviet leaders could hardly compete \r\nwith the outright lies and manipulations deployed by \r\nthe Kremlin today. Yes, they used to threaten the world \r\nwith the use of nuclear weapons, just like Russia is \r\ndoing now. However, when shown the United States \r\nintelligence aerial photos, even Khruschev could not \r\nbut recognize that the Soviet missiles were stationed \r\nin Cuba. Today, in response to thousands of available \r\nphotos, videos, satellite images, eyewitness and other \r\nevidence of the Russian military presence in Donbas, \r\nRussia only repeats over and over again its cynical \r\nrecitation: “We are not there”.\r\nRussia used to say the same about Crimea — “We \r\nare not there” — and then a sham referendum was \r\nconducted at Russian gunpoint. A few days ago, a \r\ncontradictory statement by the Russian President that \r\nCrimea was annexed in accordance with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. This is hard to imagine. Are \r\nwe really refering to the same Charter? This is not \r\nmerely disrespect for the centuries-old principles of \r\ninternational relations, written and unwritten legal \r\nand ethical rules. This is a downgrading of diplomacy \r\nas such.\r\nI believe that it is time for our Organization to work \r\nout serious safeguards against abuses of trust of the world \r\ncommunity by some United Nations Member States. \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 27/48\r\nIt is necessary to elaborate mechanisms to officially \r\ndocument evidence of the aggression of one country \r\nagainst another and to assign clear responsibility to the \r\naggressor, in line with the principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThis is the third year that the aggression against \r\nmy country continues to bring pain and suffering to the \r\nUkrainian people. Some 2,430 people have been killed, \r\na significant number of them over the past year. The \r\ntotal death toll this year in this war inflicted on us at \r\nthe heart of Europe has amounted to 2,500 members of \r\nthe military and 7,500 civilians. All together, 10,000 \r\npeople have been killed. Hundreds of hostages remain \r\nin unlawful captivity in Donbas and in Russia.\r\nI was shocked to learn that Russia-backed illegal \r\narmed formations in the occupied areas of Donbas \r\nrecently took children as hostages. They showed a \r\nvideo of the interrogation of the teenagers, whom \r\nthey absurdly accuse of conspiring and carrying out \r\nsubversive operations. This behaviour is out of place \r\nin the twenty-first century. We call on UNICEF \r\nto intervene and prevent the abuse and torture of \r\nthese children.\r\nAnother heartbreaking story is one from a few \r\ndays ago. One Ukrainian hostage volunteer, Volodymyr \r\nZhemchugov, was eventually set free. After one year \r\nin captivity without proper medical assistance, this \r\ncompletely blind man without hands said the words that \r\nare the quintessence of what is happening in Donbas.\r\n“I am a native of Donbas, I am an ethnic \r\nRussian, a former miner. But people like me in \r\nDonbas, patriots of Ukraine, were not fooled by \r\nRussian propaganda. We started to resist Russian \r\noccupation, to resist the country that set off the war \r\nagainst Ukraine.”\r\nHowever, he expressed the strong belief that soon peace \r\nwould be restored in his native land, Donbas, and that \r\npeople will return to their normal life.\r\nIn this regard, I would like to emphasize once again \r\nthat Ukraine remains committed to the settlement of the \r\nsituation in Donbas by political and diplomatic means. \r\nWe are a peaceful nation. It was never, under any \r\ncircumstances, our intention to start any conflicts with \r\nour neighbour. Over the past year, we have consistently \r\ndemonstrated in deed that we are ready to move \r\nforward on implementation of the Minsk agreements, \r\nthe comprehensive peace plan agreed in September \r\n2014 and confirmed in February 2015.\r\nYet, we have constantly faced the resistance of the \r\nKremlin and its proxies, who do their best to delay \r\nthe peace process and to shift responsibility for their \r\nown destructive actions onto Ukraine. We rely on \r\nRussia to abandon this approach to give a chance to the \r\ncomprehensive settlement. Let me stress again that the \r\nMinsk documents entail, by and large, clear guidelines \r\nfor each side on what must be done. Ukraine has done \r\na lot and will continue doing its part. Now it is time \r\nfor Russia and its proxies in the Ukrainian Donbas to \r\nstart implementing their part. Set the captives free, stop \r\nshooting, withdraw weapons, let the inspectors of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\ncarry out their mandate and watch over the Ukrainian-\r\nRussian border without any objection or any hindrance, \r\nand withdraw Russian weaponry and regular and \r\nirregular military units.\r\nThe occupying State does not limit itself to combat \r\nactions in Donbas only. It also carries on its repressive \r\npolicy in Crimea. Once thriving and free, now the \r\nCrimean peninsula has become a grey zone where \r\npeople are effectively deprived of all protection. The \r\njudicial and penitentiary systems in Crimea have been \r\nconverted by Russia into a tool of repression. As has \r\nbeen already the case so many times in history, most \r\nof the victims are Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians.The \r\nlatest addition to this picture is the ban by the Russian \r\noccupation authorities on the activities of the Mejlis, the \r\nself-governing body of the Crimean Tatar people. Add \r\nto this the arbitrary detention of Ilmi Umerov, Deputy \r\nHead of the Mejlis, in a psychiatric facility for 20 days. \r\nIn fact, the outrageous practice of punitive psychiatry, \r\nwhich had been widely used by the Soviet repressive \r\nmachinery, is now back in service for Russia.\r\nWe urge Russia to grant unimpeded access to \r\ninternational human rights organizations, both in \r\nCrimea and Donbas, and to implement the decision of the \r\nUNESCO Executive Board on establishing monitoring \r\nin Crimea at the institutional level. The residents of \r\nthe peninsula must be protected from discrimination \r\nand repression. The genocide of the Crimean Tatar \r\npeople, who already experienced the tragedy of forced \r\ndeportation 70 years ago, must not be repeated.\r\nIn Ukraine, we highly appreciate the contribution \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights and the United Nations Human Rights Council \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n28/48 16-29421\r\nto addressing the current human rights situation in \r\nmy country, including in occupied Crimea. This year, \r\nwe intend to bring this matter to the attention of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to submit a relevant draft \r\nresolution on the human rights situation in the territory \r\nof the occupied Autonomous Republic of Crimea \r\nand the city of Sevastopol. This draft resolution will \r\nbecome an impartial assessment of the human rights \r\nsituation in the occupied territories by the entire United \r\nNations family.\r\nPeople in these territories have the right to be \r\nprotected. Their children have the right to be protected. \r\nAnd it is our responsibility, as the United Nations, \r\nto protect them. I appeal to all Member States of the \r\nUnited Nations to support the initiative of Ukraine. We \r\nalso urge Member States not to recognize the legitimacy \r\nof the Russian elections that were held a few days ago \r\nin the occupied Crimea. If they do recognize them, it \r\nwill play into the hands of the aggressor and encourage \r\nfurther repression.\r\nOne more problem arising from Russia’s occupation \r\nof Crimea is its intentions to deploy tactical nuclear \r\nweapons and their means of delivery in the occupied \r\npeninsula. This would destroy the global system of the \r\nnon-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and \r\nbrutally violate Ukraine’s non-nuclear status. Moreover, \r\nRussia uses temporarily occupied Crimea to project its \r\naggressive policies not only in Ukraine, but also in other \r\ncorners of the world, including in Syria, where these \r\npolicies go hand in hand with war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity. Today, the entire democratic world is \r\ndeeply concerned over the human rights violations and \r\ndire suffering of the civilian population in Syria.\r\nI believe that the full implementation of the 2012 \r\nGeneva communiqué (S/2012/522, annex) and Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2254 (2015) is vital for the settlement \r\nof that protracted and bloody conflict. We draw \r\nparticular attention to the need to remove the threat \r\nof the use of chemical weapons in this country. Our \r\nurgent priority is to improve the humanitarian situation \r\nand ensure the access of the international humanitarian \r\norganizations to Aleppo and other cities in need. We \r\nwelcome the special meeting of the Security Council \r\non Syria this morning (see S/PV.7774), where I had \r\nan opportunity to express our views on this important \r\nissue. I hope that this discussion will lead to meaningful \r\ndecisions and tangible steps towards alleviating the \r\nplight of Syrians and bringing about peace.\r\nAfrica is yet another continent that continues to \r\nsuffer from numerous unresolved conflicts and requires \r\nour particular attention. It should finally be seen for \r\nwhat it really is — a continent with untapped potential \r\nand opportunities for the rest of the world rather \r\nthan the burden it was for decades, after centuries of \r\ncolonialism and exploitation. My country will spare no \r\neffort to support the African continent, and our African \r\npartners can fully count on Ukraine, including within \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nDespite the ongoing challenges facing Ukraine, \r\nmy country is fully committed to implementing the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) adopted by \r\nthe General Assembly last year. We will continue to \r\nwork to fulfil our SDG commitments at the national \r\nlevel, particularly those related to ensuring a healthy \r\nenvironment and a sustainable energy supply, \r\npromoting gender equality and fighting corruption. \r\nAs a member of the Friends on Climate Change group, \r\nUkraine contributed to reaching consensus on the \r\nuniversal agreement on climate change. We completed \r\nthe ratification procedures for the Paris Agreement \r\nin a very short time and deposited our ratification \r\ninstrument during today’s high-level event.\r\nThis year, we also reached an important milestone, \r\nthe completion of the United Nations Action Plan \r\non Chernobyl, as well as the end of the Decade \r\nof Recovery and Sustainable Development of the \r\nAffected Regions. However, there is a clear need for \r\ncontinued international efforts to mitigate the impact \r\nof the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant and \r\ncomplete the various projects.\r\nI am pleased to note that the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development addresses migration, \r\ncurrently one of the world’s biggest problems. In \r\nrecent years, we have witnessed unprecedented mass \r\nmovements of refugees, asylum-seekers, migrants and \r\ninternally displaced persons (IDPs). It seems hard to \r\nimagine, but today there are roughly 65 million forcibly \r\ndisplaced persons around the world, including more \r\nthan 21 million refugees, 3 million asylum-seekers and \r\n41 million internally displaced persons. Unfortunately, \r\nthose IDPs include some 1.8 million of my compatriots \r\nwho have f led the Donbas region, which has been \r\noccupied and devastated by Russia.\r\nUnquestionably, our main responsibility is saving \r\nour people’s lives and protecting those in need. \r\nHowever, to come up with a comprehensive response to \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 29/48\r\nthat global challenge, we must address its root causes. \r\nThey include, first and foremost, armed conflict, \r\nterrorism, sectarianism and poverty. The New York \r\nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants, which the \r\nAssembly just adopted as resolution 71/1, is a first \r\nstep in that direction. My Government is committed to \r\nprotecting its IDPs and has taken important measures \r\nto strengthen its national response mechanisms, paying \r\nspecial attention to ensuring that IDPs have the means \r\nto live, as well as improving their access to health care, \r\neducation, housing and employment.\r\nSeventy years ago, Winston Churchill, one of \r\nthe founding fathers of the United Nations, said at \r\nWestminster College in Fulton, Missouri:\r\n“Our difficulties and dangers will not be removed \r\nby closing our eyes to them. They will not be \r\nremoved by mere waiting to see what happens; nor \r\nwill they be removed by a policy of appeasement.”\r\nThose words have not lost their relevance today. \r\nChurchill’s vision of the United Nations as a vital \r\nsinew of peace and an essential policy foundation for \r\ninternational relations that must confront the two giant \r\nmarauders, war and tyranny, acquires a new reading for \r\nour times. He called for us to\r\n“adhere faithfully to the Charter of the United \r\nNations and walk forward in sedate and sober \r\nstrength seeking no one’s land or treasure, seeking \r\nto lay no arbitrary control upon the thoughts \r\nof men”.\r\nI hope that approach will continue to be a powerful \r\nguide for all of us. Moreover, it is the only possible way \r\nto preserve our unique Organization and save the world \r\nfrom a new global catastrophe.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the Assembly, I \r\nwish to thank the President of Ukraine for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Petro Poroshenko, President of Ukraine, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. William Ruto, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Kenya\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Kenya.\r\nMr. William Ruto, Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. William Ruto, Vice- \r\nPresident of the Republic of Kenya, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Ruto (Kenya): I would like to congratulate \r\nthe President on his well-deserved election to lead the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nSeventy-one years after the founding of the United \r\nNations, we have made significant progress in human \r\ndevelopment. Inspired by the guarantees in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, people across the world, and in \r\nAfrica in particular, have achieved freedom and self-\r\ndetermination while expanding democracy. Thanks to \r\nthe international community’s advances in technology \r\nand collective action, the world has made remarkable \r\nstrides in health care, education and agriculture and has \r\neliminated a number of killer diseases. The Cold War is \r\nbehind us, paving the way for greater opportunities for \r\nglobal synergy. Even among younger nations such as \r\nKenya, technological innovations such as M-Pesa, our \r\nmobile phone-based platform for money transfer and \r\nfinancial services, are leapfrogging us into the future, \r\npromising greater prosperity and integration.\r\nYet despite such remarkable strides, human progress \r\nis still constrained by a gamut of challenges — inequality \r\nwithin and between nations and regions, prosperity \r\nthat does not translate into prosperity for all, poverty, \r\nviolations of human rights, instability and growing \r\nenvironmental fragility. Such momentous challenges \r\ncall for a collective effort on the part of the community \r\nof nations.\r\nToday, Africa’s global trade stands at 3 per cent \r\nof the world’s total. It consists primarily of crude oil, \r\nwhich accounts for 50 per cent, while the remainder is \r\ndivided between unprocessed minerals and agricultural \r\nraw materials. Meanwhile, Africa’s population is \r\nset to surpass that of India and China combined by \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n30/48 16-29421\r\n2050. Unless our trade imbalance is reversed, as a \r\nmatter of urgency, it will accentuate vulnerability, \r\nenhance poverty and increase the risk of insecurity and \r\ninstability for both Africa and the rest of the world. We \r\nneed to reverse those trends and imbalances.\r\nThe global community, cognizant of those \r\nchallenges, has made important commitments by \r\nconcluding agreements on the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and \r\nthe Addis Ababa agreement on the African Union’s \r\nAgenda 2063. For our part, Kenya has continued to \r\nplay an active role in leading international efforts. In \r\nthe course of 2016, we have hosted three important \r\ninternational conferences seeking sustainable solutions \r\nto global challenges.\r\nFirst, we hosted the second United Nations \r\nEnvironment Assembly in May to discuss current \r\nchallenges to our global environment. Secondly, Kenya \r\nhosted the fourteenth session of the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development in July. The \r\nConference focused on pressing issues related to global \r\ntrade and economic development. Thirdly, just in the \r\npast month, in August, alongside Japan, the African \r\nUnion, the United Nations Development Programme \r\nand the World Bank Group, we co-hosted in Nairobi \r\nthe sixth Tokyo International Conference on African \r\nDevelopment. The Conference addressed specific \r\nconcerns on how to speed up economic growth, \r\ninvestment and development in Africa in order to help \r\neradicate poverty and promote shared prosperity. We \r\nforged good outcomes from all three conferences. I \r\nhave no doubt that if implemented in full, each of the \r\nrecommendations made would go a long way towards \r\ntransforming the world we live in.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment during the seventieth session ushered in \r\na new era of international development cooperation \r\nand development. The Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) reflect our ambition and hope for a better future \r\nfor ourselves and for our children. We expect that the \r\nimplementation of the SDGs will result in transformed \r\nsocieties, improved environmental and climatic \r\nconditions and global sustained economic growth. For \r\nthat to happen, however, we also believe that we must \r\neradicate the poverty in our midst by building a fairer \r\nglobal trading system and a more equitable distribution \r\nof wealth within and among countries.\r\nIt is our belief and expectation that international \r\ncooperation will remain at the core of the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda. We therefore note \r\nthe importance of global partnerships, particularly \r\nthe Global Partnership for Effective Development \r\nCooperation. The Partnership has a special role to play \r\nin accelerating the delivery of development outcomes \r\nas effectively, fairly and efficiently as possible, with \r\nparticular attention to the least developed countries. We \r\ntherefore look forward to the second high-level meeting \r\nof the Global Partnership for Effective Development \r\nCooperation that will take place in Nairobi later this \r\nyear. I extend a warm welcome to all Member States \r\nto attend.\r\nThere are certain priorities that the Government of \r\nKenya attaches great importance to in implementing \r\nthe Kenya Vision 2030, the United Nations 2030 \r\nAgenda, and the African Union’s Agenda 2063. \r\nAmong those priorities are issues of youth, women \r\nand persons with disabilities. As is the case with \r\nGovernments in developing countries, the challenge \r\nof integrating youth and women in our societies and \r\neconomies remains a daunting one, but the evidence \r\nfor us is clear. If we do not succeed at mainstreaming \r\ngender and integrating youth into our vision, goals and \r\nagendas, we shall fall miserably short of our ambitions. \r\nThat is why Kenya continues to remain focused on the \r\npriorities of youth and women, including building and \r\nfinancing special programmes for their full integration \r\nand mainstreaming\r\n In a related matter, the remarkable achievements \r\nof the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and \r\nMalaria are noteworthy. That is why the Government \r\nlast week pledged $5 million towards the fifth \r\nreplenishment cycle of the Global Fund. Moreover, \r\nwe also pledged $500,000 to the Joint United Nations \r\nProgramme on HIV/AIDS. \r\nWe are acutely aware that the challenges we face in \r\nachieving our aspirations are not only political, economic \r\nand social, but also environmental and climatic. The \r\nconservation of all wildlife and marine life, as well \r\nas the conservation and protection of our oceans, \r\nlakes and land ecosystems, including forests and trees \r\noutside forests, matters considerably to our future. Our \r\nfood security and economic prosperity — essentially, \r\nour lives — are tied to those matters, which is why we \r\ncontinue to pay great attention to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, the United Nations \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 31/48\r\nforest instruments and the Convention for International \r\nTrade in Endangered Species.\r\nKenya welcomes the ongoing preparations for \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Housing and \r\nSustainable Urban Development (Habitat III). We look \r\nforward to the Conference and subsequent adoption \r\nand implementation of the new urban agenda for the \r\ntwenty-first century. Kenya recognizes that the future \r\nof cities is fully integrated into the achievement of our \r\nown Vision 2030 and the United Nations 2030 Agenda. \r\nWe also believe that a stronger United Nations Habitat \r\nis crucial to helping guide the rapid urbanization we \r\nare witnessing across the globe. How the international \r\ncommunity continues to support the Organization and \r\nhow we handle cities throughout the world will be \r\nintegral to the success of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nToday, our world is confronted by large-scale \r\ninstability and fragility, which are causing unprecedented \r\nhuman suffering and forced displacement. Furthermore, \r\nnew security threats — including violent extremism, \r\nterrorism and radicalization — threaten to roll back \r\nthe gains we have made so far. In the Horn of Africa, \r\nthose factors, together with ecological fragility and \r\nnatural disasters in the face of scarce resources, have \r\ncomplicated the pursuit of development.\r\nKenya welcomes the adoption of the New York \r\nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) \r\nand the envisaged comprehensive refugee response \r\nframework that will guide the humanitarian response \r\nin a more humane, sensitive, timely and compassionate \r\nmanner. We also take note of and applaud the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s convening of the World Humanitarian Summit \r\nin May, which refocused the world’s attention on the \r\nplight of refugees, migrants and internally displaced \r\npersons. Kenya commits its availability to participate, \r\nas always, in discussions that will guide and give a firm \r\nway forward to that endeavour.\r\nFor the past two and a half decades, the region has \r\nbeen seized with a situation in Somalia. Throughout \r\nthat time, Kenya has stood with Somalia, provided a \r\nsafe haven for refugees, joined peacekeeping missions \r\nand invested heavily in resources to combat Al-Shabaab \r\nand its affiliates. That solidarity has helped to \r\nsubstantially weaken Al-Shabaab, liberate large swaths \r\nof land in Somalia and provide space for the Somali \r\nGovernment to begin the journey of rehabilitation \r\nand reconstruction.\r\nIt is in that context that the Government of Somalia \r\nhas strongly expressed its willingness to receive its \r\ncitizens who are currently refugees — not just in Kenya, \r\nbut in other parts of the world. For its part, Kenya has \r\ncommitted to $10 million this year to support the safe, \r\norderly, voluntary and dignified repatriation of more \r\nthan 400,000 Somali refugees living in Kenya. Sadly, \r\nthe efforts of the region and of Somalia’s neighbours \r\nhave not been matched by the commitment of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nInstead of supporting that regional effort this year, \r\nour partners, including the European Union, cut support \r\nfor the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) \r\nby 20 per cent, while security experts were suggesting \r\na budgetary increase for AMISOM in order to procure \r\nground troops to secure Somalia. Despite repeated \r\nappeals, the Security Council has failed to provide \r\nadequate, predictable funding or force multipliers \r\nfor AMISOM. I once again implore members of the \r\nSecurity Council to take the matter seriously and align \r\nthe mandate of AMISOM to the threat levels in Somalia \r\non land, air and sea.\r\nWith regard to repatriation, since 2012 the \r\ninternational community has pledged upwards of \r\n$500 million to support Somalia in its reconstruction \r\nand repatriation efforts. It is unfortunate than \r\nunder 2 per cent has been received. That failure of \r\nsolidarity has placed a disproportionate burden on \r\nSomalia’s neighbours and risks undermining all \r\nefforts concerning refugees, helping Somalia rebuild \r\nand managing the ongoing elements of terrorism and \r\nextreme radicalization.\r\nAs Somalia moves into its next phase of political \r\ntransformation, the Vision 2016 programme remains \r\nthe best course of action for the country. However, the \r\nsuccess of the post-2016 period will largely depend \r\non how the current electoral process is managed. \r\nSomalia requires the full support and commitment of \r\nthe international community in order to complete the \r\nprocess of political transition that will set the stage for \r\na peaceful and prosperous Somalia.\r\nThe road to peace and security in South Sudan \r\nhas been long and difficult. Sadly, recent events and \r\ndevelopments threaten to plunge the country, and indeed \r\nthe entire region, into a security and humanitarian crisis. \r\nKenya, as a guarantor of the 2005 Comprehensive Peace \r\nAgreement and the 2015 Agreement on the Resolution \r\nof the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, has \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n32/48 16-29421\r\nbeen spearheading the search for sustainable peace and \r\ncontinues to make significant investments in efforts to \r\nbuild peace in South Sudan.\r\nI call upon the parties to the Agreement on the \r\nResolution of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan \r\nto honour their commitment and work towards its full \r\nimplementation. That is the only basis for durable peace \r\nand reconciliation in that troubled country. The efforts \r\nof the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \r\n(IGAD), buttressed by the African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council, have been vital to these processes. \r\nThe history of conflict resolution demonstrates that \r\nregional mechanisms are the best avenues towards \r\nsustainable outcomes. It is therefore imperative that \r\nthe international community channel its efforts and \r\nsupport through IGAD.\r\nLast year, here at the United Nations, Kenya made \r\npledges during the Leaders’ Summit on Peacekeeping. \r\nI would like to confirm today that Kenya has indeed \r\nlived up to every pledge it made. The first engineering \r\ncapability troop training for African peacekeepers is \r\nready and has been completed in Nairobi. That was \r\ndone with the collaboration of our own Kenyan defence \r\nforces and the United Nations and with support from \r\nthe good Governments of Japan and Switzerland.\r\nKenya reaffirms its commitment to continuing \r\nto provide training facilities for United Nations \r\nprogrammes, as part of its pledge to strengthen United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. Kenya, as the current \r\nChair of the Peacebuilding Commission, has been at \r\nthe forefront of advocating for a new peacebuilding \r\narchitecture for sustainable peace throughout the \r\nworld. That is why, later today, Kenya will co-host a \r\npledging conference to boost the Secretary-General’s \r\nPeacebuilding Fund. For us, the message is clear — if \r\nwe are to ever enjoy a peaceful world for all, we cannot \r\ninvest any less in peacebuilding than we do in \r\npeacekeeping. Today, in the pledging conference, the \r\nGovernment of Kenya will pledge $100,000 to the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund.\r\nWhile we build the peacebuilding architecture, \r\nwe must also dedicate greater efforts to rebuilding and \r\ntransforming the United Nations system as a whole. We \r\nneed to transform our global Organization into a more \r\neffective and responsive entity that reflects the complex \r\nchallenges and realities of the twenty-first century.\r\nWith regard to the Security Council, Kenya, as a \r\nmember of the Committee of Ten Heads of State and \r\nGovernment on the Reform of the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council, is deeply concerned that progress \r\ntowards addressing the historical injustice in the \r\nrepresentation of the African continent and its people \r\non the Council remains not only slow but unpromising.\r\nThe seventy-first session must achieve greater \r\nprogress on that matter. I take this opportunity to request \r\nthat President Thomson prioritize the appointment of \r\nthe next chair of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform, who will preside over a \r\nyear of real progress on that matter. It cannot be that, \r\nin a world where democracy is the standard norm \r\nand accepted practice, the single largest body in the \r\nworld, the United Nations, plays by different rules. It \r\ncannot be that one or two or five individuals can hold \r\nransom the seven billion people living in the world. It \r\nis accepted that democracy is the basic standard for any \r\nmeaningful engagement in any part of the world, in any \r\ncountry or any self-respecting organization.\r\nIn the same light, we urge the continued \r\nstrengthening of the United Nations global footprint in \r\ngeneral and of the United Nations Office in Nairobi in \r\nparticular. That will increase the relevance of the United \r\nNations and enhance its legitimacy in the global South. \r\nSimilarly, the seventy-first session must remain \r\nseized of the two-State solution as the best way out of \r\nthe Palestinian-Israeli crisis. Kenya supports the vision \r\nof two peaceful, prosperous, brotherly States living \r\nside by side.\r\nFinally, after ten highly successful years, the time \r\nhas come for us to bid farewell to Mr. Ban Ki-moon as \r\nSecretary-General. Mr. Ban has been a great steward of \r\nthe international community, a humble and dedicated \r\nSecretary-General to Member States, a standard bearer \r\nof human rights, a champion of development and climate \r\nchange and a friend of not just Africa, but Kenya. On \r\nbehalf of the Government and people of Kenya, I wish \r\nto extend our sincere gratitude to him for his friendship \r\nand his hard work. We wish him and his wife well in \r\ntheir future pursuits.\r\nAs the international community now finally moves \r\nonto the last stage of selecting a new Secretary-General, \r\nit is my fervent hope that the Security Council will \r\nexercise its responsibility in selecting a new Secretary-\r\nGeneral in a manner that will ref lect our collective \r\nconcerns for the development agenda, for world peace \r\nand cohesion and for the key challenges that continue to \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 33/48\r\nface our collective enterprise of building a better world \r\nand a better future for all of us and for our children.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Kenya for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. William Ruto, Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nKenya, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Prince \r\nMohammed bin Naif bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, \r\nCrown Prince of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Crown Prince of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Naif bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Saud, Crown Prince of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed \r\nbin Naif bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, Crown Prince of the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPrince Mohammed (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in \r\nArabic): At the outset, it gives me great pleasure to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-first session. I wish him every success in \r\nhis endeavours.\r\nSince its participation in the establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has made \r\nevery possible effort to achieve the noble purposes to \r\nwhich we all aspire. Today, under the leadership of His \r\nMajesty King Salman Bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, we are \r\ndoing our utmost to contribute to the maintenance of \r\npeace, security and stability, not only in our region but \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nWe attach great importance to combating terrorism. \r\nWe were the among the earliest victims of terrorism. \r\nIn 1992, we were subjected to more than 100 terrorist \r\noperations, including 18 operations perpetrated by \r\nelements linked to a country of the region. Even \r\nbefore the events of September 11 2001, the Kingdom \r\nworked on an agreement among Arab countries to \r\ncombat terrorism. We have been and are still waging \r\na war to combat terrorist organizations. We have also \r\njoined more than 12 international agreements, and, \r\nin partnership with the United States and Italy, we \r\nare co-chairing the Global Coalition to Counter the \r\nIslamic State of Iraq and the Levant. Moreover, in \r\norder to rectify the extremist thinking among some \r\nindividuals, we have established the Mohammed bin \r\nNaif Counseling and Care Center to provide care and to \r\ncriminalize terrorism and its funding.\r\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is home to many \r\nIslamic religious sites. We were the first to condemn the \r\nterrorist attacks of 11 September. We have expressed our \r\nsolidarity with the United States and we have sought to \r\nuproot terrorism. Security forces in the Kingdom have \r\nbeen able to uncover 268 terrorist operations before \r\nthey took place, including operations against friendly \r\ncountries. We find it odd that in the United States there \r\nis an attempt to ratify a law on sovereign immunity, \r\nwhich will have negative repercussions.\r\nWe believe that fighting terrorism requires \r\ninternational participation and an international \r\npartnership. We need concerted efforts at all levels in \r\norder to counter terrorism at the security, intellectual, \r\nfinancial and military levels. We also stress that fighting \r\nterrorism requires cooperation based on the rules and \r\nprinciples for which this Organization was established.\r\nWe also wish to commend the role of the Islamic \r\nmilitary coalition to combat terrorism, which was \r\nestablished in Riyadh by 40 Islamic countries. We \r\nhave provided all possible support and facilities to the \r\ncommand centre so that it can lead the efforts to combat \r\nterrorism. We hope the international community will \r\nparticipate in supporting this international centre to \r\ncombat terrorism.\r\nThe international community must take all possible \r\nmeasures to put an end to the ongoing suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people. We believe that the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative should form the basis for restoring peace to \r\nthe region in order to enable the Palestinian people \r\nto exercise their legitimate rights and establish an \r\nindependent State with Jerusalem as its capital. We \r\nalso condemn Israeli aggressions and attacks against \r\nAl-Aqsa mosque and the construction work that \r\nthreatens the sanctity of the mosque.\r\nThe coalition forces that support Yemen’s legitimacy \r\nhave sought to help the Yemeni people. The international \r\ncommunity has rejected what the rebels are attempting \r\nto do. The Kingdom supports the efforts of the Special \r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General to reach a political \r\nresolution based on Security Council resolution 2216 \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n34/48 16-29421\r\n(2015), the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\nand the outcomes of the Yemen National Dialogue. The \r\nlegitimate Government accepted this proposal, but the \r\nrebels rejected it and they continue to threaten and kill \r\ninnocent civilians. \r\nWe are the biggest supporter of humanitarian \r\noperations in Yemen. We have provided humanitarian \r\nand development assistance, amounting to about 2 per \r\ncent of our income, to 95 countries. That is in addition \r\nto our humanitarian work for which purpose we have \r\nestablished the King Salman Humanitarian Aid and \r\nRelief Centre.\r\nThe crisis in Syria has left hundreds of thousands \r\nof people dead and injured, displaced millions and calls \r\non us all to put an end to an unprecedented tragedy. \r\nBased on the first Geneva conference on the crisis in \r\nSyria, it is high time to find a political solution to the \r\ncrisis that would ensure Syria’s unity and maintain \r\nits institutions. Since the beginning of the crisis, the \r\nKingdom has opened its doors to host hundreds of \r\nthousands of Syrians, not as refugees in camps but \r\non the basis of brotherly and ethical principles in \r\norder to maintain their dignity and safety. We have \r\nprovided them with all of the necessary facilities, as \r\nwell as health care. We also provided them with job and \r\neducation opportunities.\r\nWe call on our brothers and sisters in Libya to \r\ncontinue to rebuild their State and confront the terrorist \r\ngroups. With regard to Iraq, we stress that it is important \r\nto maintain Iraq’s unity and territorial integrity and rid \r\nthe country of all terrorist groups. We condemn any \r\nactivity that leads to strife and violence. \r\nOur embassy in Tehran and our consulate in \r\nMashhad were the targets of attacks under the watchful \r\neye of the Iranian authorities. They have not provided us \r\nwith sufficient protection, as stipulated in international \r\nagreements. We therefore call on the Iranian authorities \r\nto assume their responsibility in that regard. We seek \r\ngood relations with Iran based on the principles of \r\ngood-neighbourliness and non-interference in other \r\ncountries’ internal affairs. We call for the end of the \r\nIranian occupation of the three Emirati islands\r\nWe assert that all nuclear weapons and weapons of \r\nmass destruction must be eliminated from the Middle \r\nEast and that a date must be set for the international \r\nconference to create a Middle East free of nuclear \r\nweapons. The Kingdom is committed to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights, in accordance with the \r\nprinciples of Islam. We call for the adoption of policies \r\nto reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \r\nWe also need to look at sources of energy as \r\ncomplementary and not as alternatives to other energy \r\nsources and in a way that would ensure sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all. In that regard, we note that the \r\nKingdom has invested in developing new carbon \r\ncapture technology in our effort to protect and preserve \r\nthe environment. \r\nWe would also like to highlight the importance of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development that was \r\nratified by the General Assembly last year. We have \r\nlaunched our vision for 2030, which is based on the main \r\nprinciples of the 2030 Agenda, on Arab and Islamic \r\ncultures and traditions and on our geographic location. \r\nThat vision is aimed at advancing our economy and \r\nachieved development in the fields of energy, industry, \r\nhealth, education, tourism and other fields. \r\nIn order to increase our non-oil exports and \r\ncreate the necessary conditions to attract local and \r\ninternational investment, we have also worked with the \r\nprivate sector so that it could become the State’s main \r\npartner. We have also provided essential services in \r\nhealth, education and housing. \r\nWe will spare no effort in working with the \r\ninternational community in order to achieve the good \r\nof humankind. We will continue to play our role at the \r\nhumanitarian, political and economic levels. We will \r\nalso seek to reform United Nations agencies and are \r\nconfident that the Organization will be able to respond \r\nto tomorrow’s challenges so that future generations will \r\nenjoy peace, security and stability.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Crown Prince of the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Mohammed bin Naif bin \r\nAbdulaziz Al-Saud, Crown Prince of the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak \r\nAl-Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the State \r\nof Kuwait.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 35/48\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak \r\nAl-Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of \r\nKuwait, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nSheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait)(spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to extend our sincere congratulations \r\nto the President and his country, the Republic of Fiji, on \r\nhis election to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session, and to assure him of my country’s \r\nfull cooperation as he shoulders a great responsibility. \r\nI also take this opportunity to pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his efforts and \r\nhis success in presiding over the discussions of the \r\nprevious session.\r\nWe would also like to sincerely thank His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose \r\nmandate will expire at the end of the year. He has spent \r\nalmost a decade at the helm of the Organization and has \r\nworked diligently and honestly to promote international \r\npeace and security. He has played a prominent role in \r\nenhancing the performance of the organs of the United \r\nNations and in achieving major milestones, such as \r\nthe adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand the signing of the global agreement on climate \r\nchange. We would like to wish His Excellency every \r\nsuccess in his future endeavours and look forward to \r\nhis continued service to the causes of security, peace \r\nand development.\r\nAt this new session of the General Assembly, we \r\nconvene under the theme “The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals: a universal push to transform our world” amid \r\nunprecedented security and economic challenges. That \r\nwill require greater coordination and the doubling of our \r\nefforts to overcome such challenges, limit their impact \r\nand address their root causes. In that regard, the State \r\nof Kuwait welcomes the two historic agreements on \r\nclimate change, signed by Kuwait at this very rostrum \r\nin April, and the comprehensive and inclusive 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, whose Goals \r\nwe hope will be achieved. We pledge to make every \r\neffort to contribute effectively within the framework \r\nof an international partnership to fully implement the \r\nSustainable Development Goals over the next 14 years.\r\nAs we stand in support of the developing countries \r\nand the least developed countries, the State of Kuwait \r\nfirmly believes that countries aff licted by natural \r\ndisasters and those affected by the scourge of war \r\nneed to be assisted. That should be done in a manner \r\nensuring the enhancement of the relations Kuwait has \r\nhad with the peoples and countries of the world since \r\nit attained its independence in 1961. It has set out a \r\nconsistent approach according to which it stands by \r\nthe developing and least developed countries. Kuwait \r\nhas attained a prestigious standing among donors \r\nproviding humanitarian assistance as a consequence \r\nof its initiatives and continued response to the appeals \r\nlaunched by the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies to alleviate the suffering of affected peoples \r\nand countries throughout the world, thereby helping \r\nthem cope with their crises. \r\nKuwait is also eager to achieve a world in which \r\njustice and equality prevail in support of human values \r\nand where the haves unconditionally provide for the \r\ndeserving have-nots. In that regard, I would like to \r\nreiterate Kuwait’s intention to honour all its pledges \r\nmade at international conferences.\r\nKuwait is proud to occupy first place in the provision \r\nof humanitarian assistance as a ratio of its gross domestic \r\nincome, according to United Nations statistics for 2015. \r\nKuwait takes pride in such recognition, and the Kuwait \r\nFund for Arab Economic Development continues \r\nto play a pioneering role in providing soft loans and \r\ngrants, representing approximately $20 billion, to fund \r\ndevelopment programmes, which have benefited 105 \r\ncountries in various parts of the world.\r\nConsistently adhering to the noble purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nState of Kuwait has worked towards achieving and \r\nlaying down the foundations of security and stability \r\nin our region through participating in all efforts that \r\ncontribute to the promotion of international peace and \r\nsecurity. In that connection, I would like to refer to \r\nthe crisis in Yemen and to renew our support for the \r\npolitical solution brokered by the United Nations in \r\naccordance with the outcome of the national dialogue, \r\nthe initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council, its \r\nimplementation mechanism, and Security Council \r\nresolution 2216 (2015). The State of Kuwait hosted the \r\nYemeni peace talks under the auspices of the United \r\nNations from April to August in order to restore \r\nsecurity and stability in Yemen while preserving its \r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n36/48 16-29421\r\nWe take this opportunity to renew our praise of \r\nand support for the efforts undertaken by the Special \r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for Yemen, Mr. Ismail \r\nOuld Cheikh Ahmad, and call upon him to intensify \r\nthose efforts for the prompt resumption of dialogue \r\nbetween the Yemeni parties under the aegis of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn Syria, we are following with concern the \r\nongoing crisis, which is now entering its sixth year, \r\nand the worsening conditions throughout the country. \r\nThe deteriorating humanitarian situation has displaced \r\n13 million Syrians within and beyond the country’s \r\nborders, making the Syrian people the largest refugee \r\ncommunity in the world. The number of those who have \r\nbeen killed now exceeds 250,000. We strongly condemn \r\nthe intentional targeting of residential areas and civil \r\nand medical facilities, indiscriminate bombing, and \r\nthe use of barrel bombs and internationally banned \r\nweapons. We also demand that all those responsible \r\nfor perpetrating war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity be brought to justice within the international \r\njustice system.\r\nDriven by its desire to alleviate the suffering \r\nof the Syrian people, the State of Kuwait has hosted \r\nthree international pledging conferences to support \r\nhumanitarian efforts in Syria. Pledges totalled more \r\nthan $7 billion, of which my country contributed \r\n$1.3 billion. The largest share of those pledges has \r\nbeen allotted to United Nations specialized agencies \r\nand intergovernmental and non-governmental \r\norganizations dealing with humanitarian affairs. That \r\neffort complements Kuwait’s participation as co-host of \r\nthe fourth Supporting Syria and the Region conference, \r\nheld in London early this year.\r\nThe State of Kuwait reiterates its support for \r\nUnited Nations and other international efforts aimed \r\nat reaching a political solution in Syria in accordance \r\nwith Security Council resolution 2254 (2015), which \r\ncharted a clear path for the political solution based \r\non the 2012 Geneva communiqué (S/2012/522, annex) \r\nand the two Vienna communiqués. I also commend \r\nthe efforts of the United States of America and the \r\nRussian Federation to reach a ceasefire that would pave \r\nthe way for political talks among the Syrian parties to \r\nreach a settlement that would preserve the sovereignty, \r\nunity, territorial integrity and independence of Syria, \r\nrealizing the legitimate hopes and aspirations of the \r\nbrotherly Syrian people.\r\nInternational efforts have been carried out to \r\ncombat the phenomena of terrorism, extremism and \r\nacts of violence, which have been on the rise as a new \r\ninternational reality because of the ongoing crises in \r\nthe region, for which no permanent solution is in sight. \r\nIt is therefore incumbent upon us to recognize that \r\ncombating these odious phenomena is an international \r\nresponsibility and that no single country by itself, \r\ndespite its every effort, can confront or eliminate them. \r\nIt is also morally impermissible to link the phenomena \r\nto any nationality, religion or civilization.\r\nThe State of Kuwait reiterates its principled and \r\nfirm position in condemning terrorist acts in all their \r\nforms and manifestations, as well as its total rejection \r\nof all acts of violence and extremism that not only \r\nrun counter to international laws and norms, but also \r\nto the teachings of the true tenets of Islam, all other \r\ndivine religions, and cultural and human values. In that \r\ncontext, the State of Kuwait is actively contributing to \r\ncombating terrorism by providing support and backing \r\nto the international coalition established to combat \r\nwhat is known as the Da’esh terrorist group in Iraq.\r\nWe reiterate our position to stand by and support \r\nthe Government of Iraq, and we commend its \r\nachievements in combating terrorism and confronting \r\nDa’esh. We emphasize our support for its measures \r\nand actions to maintain its own security, stability and \r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nTurning to the situation Libya, which is a source of \r\ngrave concern, the State of Kuwait welcomes the decision \r\nof the Presidential Council to form the Government of \r\nNational Accord. Kuwait considers it an important step \r\ntowards the implementation of the provisions of the \r\nLibyan Political Agreement, and one that we hope will \r\nassist our Libyan brothers in overcoming the status quo \r\nin a manner that preserves the unity and independence \r\nof Libya and the prosperity of its people.\r\nThe failure of the international community to find \r\na permanent and comprehensive solution to the conflict \r\nin the Middle East threatens peace and security in the \r\nregion more than ever as a result of the oppressive \r\npractices of the Israeli occupation forces and Israel’s \r\nconsistent, excessive and unjustifiable use of force \r\nagainst the Palestinian people in blatant and clear-cut \r\nviolation of resolutions of international legitimacy and \r\nthe Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.\r\nThe persistence of the Israeli occupation authority \r\nin pursuing aggressive practices and policies against \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 37/48\r\nthe Palestinian people regrettably emanates from a firm \r\nconviction that Israel is immune from any international \r\naccountability, exempt from any prosecution and \r\nprotected from any criticism or condemnation by \r\ninternational organizations. It is, therefore, incumbent \r\nupon the Security Council to carry out its responsibilities \r\nand pressure Israel to implement the resolutions \r\nof international legitimacy. Such implementation \r\nwould lead to the Palestinian people’s attaining their \r\nlegitimate political rights and their own independent \r\nState with their own territory. East Jerusalem would be \r\nits capital and its borders would be those of 4 June 1967, \r\nin accordance with the principle of land for peace and \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative.\r\nIn support of Palestine, the State of Kuwait \r\nis currently working on hosting an international \r\nconference on the suffering of Palestinian children, \r\nwhich will shed light on Israel’s serious and persistent \r\nviolations of international conventions and norms \r\nrelative to the rights of the child. In this connection, \r\nI wish to praise the initiative of the friendly French \r\nRepublic and its efforts to push the Middle East peace \r\nprocess forward. The joint communiqué of 3 June 2016 \r\non the subject of an international conference reflects \r\nits interest in launching a new process with a view \r\nto reaching a just and comprehensive solution in the \r\nregion.\r\nAs regards the Islamic Republic of Iran, the State \r\nof Kuwait, along with the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\ncountries, looks forward to relations of friendship and \r\ncooperation with Iran permeated with understanding \r\nand mutual respect. We also wish to emphasize the \r\nneed to create appropriate conditions for constructive \r\ndialogue to take place in conformity with the rules and \r\nnorms of international law relating to the principles of \r\ngood-neighbourly relations, respect for the sovereignty \r\nof States and non-interference in their internal affairs, \r\nand refraining from any practices that contravene \r\ninternational conventions and norms that threaten \r\nthe security and stability of the region. Additionally, \r\nthe occupation of the three Emirate islands must end \r\nand the concerns of our sister nation, the United Arab \r\nEmirates, must be addressed and receive a solution, \r\nthrough either direct negotiation or resort to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nIn conclusion, I am pleased to refer to the candidature \r\nof the State of Kuwait for membership in the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2018-2019. I would like to avail \r\nmyself of the opportunity to extend my thanks to all the \r\nmember States of the Asia and Pacific Group in New \r\nYork, which endorsed Kuwait’s candidature last month. \r\nWe look forward to the support of all States Members \r\nof the United Nations in the elections that will be held \r\nin June next year. As I have emphasized, my country \r\nis committed to the principles and purposes of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter. Being a small, peace-loving \r\ncountry, Kuwait bases its relations with others on the \r\nprinciples of respect for sovereignty and independence, \r\ngood-neighbourly relations and non-interference in \r\ntheir internal affairs. We look forward to facilitating \r\nthe process of finding solutions by consensus. Peace be \r\nupon you.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Kuwait for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber \r\nAl-Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, \r\nPrime Minister of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Pakistan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Pakistan.\r\nMr. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Muhammad Nawaz \r\nSharif, Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of \r\nPakistan, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sharif (Pakistan): We congratulate Mr. Peter \r\nThomson on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. We agree that the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment should be the focus of the session. We also \r\npay tribute to Mr. Lykketoft for his able stewardship of \r\nthe seventieth session.\r\n Today, three decades after the end of the Cold War, \r\nour multipolar world is more free and vibrant, yet still \r\nchaotic and turbulent; more interdependent, but more \r\nunequal; more prosperous, yet still aff licted by poverty. \r\nWe see spectacular progress, but also unprecedented \r\nhuman suffering. The world is at a historic inflection \r\npoint. The international order established after the \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n38/48 16-29421\r\nSecond World War is passing away, but a new order \r\nhas yet to emerge. Competition between the major \r\nPowers is becoming more confrontational. This can \r\npose serious threats to peace across Asia. A new cold \r\nwar threatens to engulf Europe, where the momentum \r\ntowards greater union has already been reversed. \r\nBarricades and walls are going up, especially against \r\nthe tide of misery f lowing out of a turbulent Middle \r\nEast. In many countries, intolerance has revived the \r\nghosts of xenophobia and Islamophobia.\r\nTurmoil is intensifying in the Middle East. \r\nInternational efforts to defeat Da’esh are therefore \r\nurgent. For this, it is essential to reconcile the divergent \r\nobjectives and priorities of regional and external Powers. \r\nPeace cannot be built when injustice prevails. The long- \r\nfestering tragedy of Palestine demands determined \r\naction on the part of the international community.\r\nAfter decades of strong growth, the world \r\neconomy has reached a plateau. Yet despite the adverse \r\ninternational economic environment, in the past three \r\nyears my Government has moved the country towards \r\nrobust growth. We have fully integrated the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development into our own \r\neconomic and social strategy, based on our conviction \r\nthat people are the true wealth of our nation and that \r\nhuman development will determine our future destiny.\r\nOur priority goal of economic development \r\nrequires internal peace and stability. My country has \r\nbeen the principal victim of terrorism in our world, \r\nincluding terrorism supported, sponsored and financed \r\nfrom abroad. We will not allow externally sponsored \r\nterrorism and threats of destabilization to cause \r\nturbulence in Pakistan. Tens of thousands of our citizens \r\nand thousands of our security personnel have been killed \r\nor injured in terrorist attacks. That has only reinforced \r\nour resolve to eliminate the scourge of terrorism. Our \r\ncomprehensive strategy of law enforcement and targeted \r\nmilitary operations has produced remarkable results \r\nand enabled Pakistan to turn the tide against terrorists. \r\nOur Zarb-e-Azb operation is the largest, most robust \r\nand most successful anti-terrorism campaign anywhere \r\nin the world, deploying 200,000 of our security forces. \r\nOur comprehensive national action plan is fully \r\nendorsed by our people and our Parliament as well as \r\nby our security forces, all of whom have made heroic \r\nsacrifices to defeat terrorism.\r\nTerrorism, however, is now a global phenomenon \r\nthat must be addressed comprehensively and in all its \r\nforms, including State terrorism. The international \r\ncommunity must coordinate its efforts if we are to \r\naccomplish that. Such efforts should be approached \r\ncollectively, not through the unilateral enactment of \r\nlaws with extraterritorial provisions that target certain \r\ncountries. We will not win the fight against terrorism \r\nand violent extremism if we do not address their root \r\ncauses. They lie in poverty and ignorance, political and \r\nsocial injustice and oppression, foreign intervention and \r\noccupation and denial of the legitimate rights of peoples \r\nand nations, especially the right to self-determination. \r\nUntil those underlying causes are addressed, it will \r\nbe difficult to counter the twisted narrative of violent \r\nextremists and terrorists.\r\nAfter 15 years of the current war in Afghanistan, \r\nthe international community agrees that the only \r\nroad to a lasting peace in that country is through a \r\ndialogue between the Government in Kabul and the \r\nAfghan Taliban. Pakistan has long proposed this as \r\nthe most viable way to end the decades of conflict \r\nand suffering in Afghanistan. Based on that belief in \r\na negotiated peace, and in response to requests from \r\nPresident Ashraf Ghani, we have been facilitating the \r\nprocess of reconciliation in Afghanistan. There have \r\nbeen setbacks, but they are not a sufficient reason to \r\nabandon the path of peace and rely on the military \r\noption, which for the past decade and a half has failed \r\nto stabilize Afghanistan. Progress will be assured only \r\nwhen the Afghan parties themselves conclude that there \r\nis no military solution to the war and begin to work \r\nassiduously, through a meaningful dialogue process, to \r\nachieve reconciliation and peace at home.\r\nMore than three and a half decades of conflict \r\nand chaos in Afghanistan have had grave security and \r\neconomic consequences for Pakistan. Almost 3 million \r\nAfghan refugees, to whom we have opened our homes \r\nand hearts, remain in Pakistan. We hope to see them \r\nreturn home voluntarily and with dignity. Until they \r\ndo, the international community must shoulder its \r\nresponsibility for helping to sustain them.\r\nConfrontation should not be our destiny in South \r\nAsia. Pakistan wants peace with India and we have gone \r\nthe extra mile to achieve it, repeatedly offering to hold \r\na dialogue to address all outstanding issues. But India \r\nhas posed unacceptable preconditions for engaging \r\nin dialogue. Let us be clear that talks are not some \r\nspecial favour for Pakistan. They are in the interest \r\nof both countries. They are essential to resolving our \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 39/48\r\ndifferences, especially in the Jammu and Kashmir \r\ndispute, and to averting the danger of any escalation.\r\nPeace and normalization between Pakistan and India \r\ncannot be achieved without a resolution of the Kashmir \r\ndispute. That is an objective evaluation, not a partisan \r\nposition. Our predictions have now been confirmed \r\nby events. A new generation of Kashmiris has risen \r\nspontaneously against India, demanding freedom from \r\nits illegal occupation. The young leader Burhan Wani, \r\nmurdered by Indian forces, has emerged as a symbol \r\nof the latest Kashmiri intifada, a popular and peaceful \r\nfreedom movement led by Kashmiris young and old, \r\nmen and women, armed only with undying faith in the \r\nlegitimacy of their cause and a hunger for freedom in \r\ntheir hearts.\r\nAs usual, the indigenous Kashmiri uprising has \r\nbeen met with brutal repression by India’s occupation \r\nforce of more than half a million soldiers. More than \r\na hundred Kashmiris have been killed; hundreds, \r\nincluding children and infants, have been blinded by \r\nshotgun pellets; and more than 6,000 unarmed civilians \r\nhave been injured over the past two months. \r\nThe Indian brutalities are well documented. I would \r\nlike to inform the General Assembly that Pakistan will \r\nshare with the Secretary-General a dossier containing \r\ndetailed information and evidence of the gross and \r\nsystematic violations of human rights committed by \r\nIndian forces in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The \r\nbrutalities will not suppress the Kashmiris’ spirits; \r\nthey will only intensify their anger and fortify their \r\ndetermination to see India end its occupation of \r\nKashmir. From Srinagar to Sopore, the men, women \r\nand children come out each day, defying a curfew, to \r\ndemand freedom.\r\nPakistan fully supports the demand of the \r\nKashmiri people for self-determination, as several \r\nSecurity Council resolutions have promised them. \r\nTheir struggle is a legitimate one for liberation from \r\nalien occupation. International law and the declarations \r\nof the United Nations on self-determination give them \r\nthe right to struggle for their freedom. Every year, the \r\nGeneral Assembly unanimously adopts a resolution that \r\nreaffirms the right of all peoples to self-determination \r\nand calls on the States concerned to immediately end \r\ntheir occupation and all acts of repression.\r\nOn behalf of the Kashmiri people; on behalf of the \r\nmothers and fathers of the innocent Kashmiri children; \r\non behalf of women and men who have been killed, \r\nblinded and injured; on behalf of the Pakistani nation, \r\nI demand an independent inquiry into the extrajudicial \r\nkillings and a United Nations fact-finding mission \r\nto investigate brutalities perpetrated by the Indian \r\noccupying forces so that those guilty of such atrocities \r\nare punished. We demand the immediate release of \r\nall Kashmiri political prisoners, an end to the curfew, \r\nfreedom for the Kashmiris to demonstrate peacefully, \r\nurgent medical help for the injured and abrogation of \r\nIndia’s draconian laws.\r\nThe Security Council has called for the exercise \r\nof the right to self-determination by the people of \r\nJammu and Kashmir through a free and fair plebiscite, \r\nheld under United Nations auspices. The people of \r\nKashmir have waited 70 years for the implementation \r\nof that promise. The Security Council must honour \r\nits commitments by implementing its own decisions. \r\nThe General Assembly must demand that India deliver \r\non the commitments its leaders solemnly made on \r\nmany occasions.\r\nTo that end, steps should be taken by the United \r\nNations to demilitarize Jammu and Kashmir and \r\nundertake consultations with India, Pakistan and \r\nthe true representatives of the Kashmiri people to \r\nimplement the resolutions of the Security Council. In \r\nthat context, we welcome the offer of his good offices \r\nby Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We will also open \r\nconsultations with members of the Security Council to \r\nexplore the modalities for the implementation of the \r\nrelevant Council resolutions on Kashmir.\r\nThe international community ignores the danger of \r\nrising tensions in South Asia at its own peril. For its part, \r\nPakistan is committed to the establishment of strategic \r\nstability in the region. It neither wants nor is engaged \r\nin an arms race with India. But we cannot ignore our \r\nneighbour’s unprecedented arms build-up, and we will \r\ntake whatever measures are necessary to maintain \r\ncredible deterrence. We have consistently urged the \r\nconclusion of bilateral arms control and disarmament \r\nmeasures between Pakistan and India to prevent \r\nconflict and avoid wasteful military expenditures.\r\nWe are open to discussing all measures of restraint \r\nand responsibility with India in any forum or format \r\nand without any conditions. We are ready for talks to \r\nagree on a bilateral nuclear test ban treaty. Today, from \r\nthis rostrum, I would also like to reiterate our offer to \r\nIndia to enter into a serious and sustained dialogue \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n40/48 16-29421\r\nfor the peaceful resolution of all outstanding disputes, \r\nespecially Jammu and Kashmir.\r\nAs a responsible nuclear-weapon State, Pakistan \r\nwill continue to cooperate with all international efforts \r\nthat seek to promote fair and equitable solutions to \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation challenges. We \r\nhave introduced state-of-the-art measures to strengthen \r\nthe safety and security of our nuclear materials and \r\nfacilities. We have adopted a comprehensive export \r\ncontrol regime that is fully consistent with international \r\nstandards. Judged on the basis of objective criteria and \r\nwithout discrimination, Pakistan is fully eligible for \r\nmembership in the Nuclear Suppliers Group.\r\nIn our turbulent and interdependent world, the \r\nUnited Nations remains an indispensable organization \r\nin terms of restoring order and ensuring global peace, \r\nstability and prosperity. Its principles remain the \r\ncrucial pillars of international legality, the guide \r\nfor the conduct of Member States and the guarantor \r\nof the legitimate rights of all nations and peoples. \r\nThe United Nations must regain its credibility as \r\nthe central instrument for the promotion of peace, \r\nprosperity and liberty. To that end, it should become \r\nmore representative, transparent and accountable. A \r\ncomprehensive and democratic reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, which Pakistan supports, should enhance its \r\nrelevance and representation. Creating new centres of \r\nprivilege will do the opposite.\r\nPakistan’s unwavering commitment to the United \r\nNations is well established. We have played a pioneering \r\nand consistent role in United Nations peacekeeping. \r\nDespite our own security requirements, we will remain \r\none of the world’s largest troop-contributing countries \r\nand maintain our record of success in multiple United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations.\r\nPakistan has a vital stake in ending conflicts, \r\nfostering peace, fighting terrorism, strengthening \r\ndemocracy, promoting human rights, generating global \r\ngrowth and overcoming the challenges of environmental \r\ndegradation. We can achieve those goals and create a \r\nnew and peaceful world order, solely through the United \r\nNations and with strict adherence to the principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Muhammad Nawaz Sharif, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Pakistan, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Aung San Sun Kyi, State Counsellor \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the \r\nUnion of Myanmar.\r\nMs. Kyi (Myanmar): As the first representative of \r\nthe new Government of Myanmar to speak before the \r\nAssembly, it is my duty and my privilege to reaffirm \r\nour faith and confidence in the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. The strength of \r\nthe Organization lies in its universality and legitimacy, \r\nanchored in the Charter and in the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law. For all its imperfections \r\nand limitations, the United Nations remains a receptacle \r\nof our hopes for a more peaceful and prosperous world, \r\na kinder, more compassionate home for all humankind.\r\nMy country joined the United Nations as the newly \r\nindependent Union of Burma in 1948. It was an era of \r\ndetermined hope, when the peoples of the world rose \r\nout of the ravages of war to build anew their countries \r\nand their faith in the human capacity for achieving \r\npeace with egalitarianism, prosperity with justice. \r\nNow, once again, it is a time of determined hope for \r\nMyanmar. When our people cast the overwhelming \r\nmajority of their votes in favour of the National League \r\nfor Democracy during the elections in November 2015, \r\nthey were demonstrating their support, not just for a \r\npolitical party, but for a political culture founded on \r\na belief in their right and their capacity to fashion \r\nthe future of the country in the shape of their dreams \r\nand aspirations. And those dreams and aspirations echo \r\nthe dreams and aspirations that led to the founding of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe dream of turning swords into ploughshares — or, \r\nto use a more modern idiom, converting weapons of \r\ndestruction into farm machinery — is one that our \r\npeople, who have long been compelled to sacrifice \r\ntheir sleep and their fields to the exigencies of conflict, \r\nunderstand in their hearts and their minds. To be safe \r\nin our own homes, to be confident in our capacity to \r\nrealize our full potential, to be happy in the promise \r\nof progress for our young and security for our elderly, \r\nto be strong in our rights and duties as citizens of a \r\npeaceful and prosperous Union — those are our simple \r\naspirations. They are simple, but, it hardly needs to be \r\nsaid, not easy to achieve. And the only path that will \r\nlead us to our goals is the path of peace, the path that we \r\nmust follow with hope and determination.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 41/48\r\n The people of Myanmar have long been deprived \r\nof their inherent right to live in peace and security, \r\nto fundamental freedom and to development — to \r\nsustainable development, in the context of the Goals of \r\nour 2030 Agenda. For a country that has experienced \r\nover six decades of internal armed conflict, nothing is \r\nmore important than the achievement of lasting peace \r\nand national reconciliation. It is a difficult and complex \r\ntask and one which the new Government of Myanmar is \r\ntaking on as a major challenge and a high priority.\r\nRecently, we convened the first session of the \r\nUnion Peace Conference, also known as the 21st \r\nCentury Panglong Conference, as it embodies the spirit \r\nof Panglong, the 1947 conference that paved the way \r\nto the founding of the independent Union of Burma. \r\nAttended by representatives of the Government, \r\nParliament, armed forces, ethnic armed groups, political \r\nparties and civil society organizations, the Union Peace \r\nConference is based on the principle of inclusiveness \r\nand embodies the spirit of Union. The Conference is not \r\nan end in itself. It is the first vital step on our journey to \r\nnational reconciliation and lasting peace that will save \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of fraternal \r\nstrife, which has brought untold sorrow to our peoples.\r\nOver the past few years, the world has focused \r\nits attention on the situation in the country’s Rakhine \r\nstate. As a responsible member of the community of \r\nnations, we do not fear international scrutiny. We are \r\ncommitted to a sustainable solution that will lead to \r\npeace, stability and development for all communities \r\nwithin the state. \r\nOur Government is taking a holistic approach that \r\nmakes development central to both short- and long-term \r\nprogrammes aimed at promoting understanding and \r\ntrust. The Central Committee for the Implementation of \r\nPeace, Stability and Development in Rakhine State was \r\nestablished soon after our new Government took office. \r\nThe working committees established under the Central \r\nCommittee are undertaking the tasks of establishing \r\nsecurity, peace and stability, and rule of law; scrutinizing \r\nimmigration and citizenship; facilitating settlements \r\nand implementing socioeconomic development; and \r\ncoordinating and cooperating with United Nations \r\nagencies and international organizations in providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance. To buttress our efforts to \r\naddress the issue comprehensively and more effectively, \r\nwe have also established the Advisory Commission on \r\nRakhine State, chaired by Mr. Kofi Annan, former \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nThere has been persistent opposition from some \r\nquarters to the establishment of the Commission. \r\nHowever, we are determined to persevere in our \r\nendeavour to achieve harmony, peace and prosperity in \r\nRakhine state. Here, I would like to take the opportunity to \r\nask for the understanding and constructive contribution \r\nof the international community. By standing firm \r\nagainst the forces of prejudice and intolerance, we are \r\nreaffirming our faith in fundamental human rights, in \r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person.\r\nPeace and national reconciliation are prerequisites \r\nfor the successful implementation of policies and \r\nprogrammes aimed at fulfilling the social and \r\neconomic needs of our people. Myanmar’s 2016 national \r\neconomic and development policy is designed to meet \r\nmany of the Sustainable Development Goals, including \r\nthose concerning the enhancement of infrastructure \r\ninvestment, agriculture, the private sector, small and \r\nmedium-sized enterprises and, in particular, poverty \r\nalleviation. National reconciliation, job creation and \r\nconservation of natural resources, capacity-building \r\nand creating opportunities for the young are the key \r\nobjectives of our people-centred inclusive policy. Many \r\nof our shared concerns as Members of the United \r\nNations have already been discussed comprehensively \r\nin the Assembly since the general debate opened \r\nyesterday. Mindful of the President’s exhortation to \r\nkeep within the limits of the time allotted to each of us, \r\nI will therefore touch upon just a few issues: migration, \r\nterrorism, nuclear disarmament. I asked my delegation \r\nhow it would be if I spoke for less than 15 minutes, \r\nand they assured me that it would make everybody \r\nvery happy.\r\nDurable solutions to problems can be found only \r\nby investigating their roots. The unprecedented scale \r\nof migration in recent years and the consequent \r\nsufferings make it an imperative to address the two \r\nmost important causes of irregular migration: lack of \r\npeace and lack of development. While talking about \r\nbuilding peace and development, we cannot neglect \r\nthe important aspect of enhancing respect for human \r\nrights, equality, diversity and tolerance with a balanced \r\nimplementation of multidimensional economic policies. \r\nIt is a challenging task, and there is a need for countries \r\nto work in collaboration with each other to seek just \r\nand comprehensive solutions in compliance with \r\ninternational law.\r\nMigrants contribute to the economies of their \r\nhost countries and to the global economy. I therefore \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n42/48 16-29421\r\nbelieve that building cooperation and collaboration \r\nbetween the host country and the country of origin in \r\nensuring the rights of migrant workers will be mutually \r\nreinforcing for both. Our planet is a place to be shared \r\nby all. Sharing values and wealth will create a better \r\nworld for all of us.\r\nWe must be united in standing against all forms and \r\nmanifestations of violent extremism related to religious, \r\ncultural and social intolerance. Having identified \r\nextremism as a root of terrorism, we need to explore \r\nthe causes of extremism. Lack of social and economic \r\nsecurity are, no doubt, important factors, but I believe \r\nthat we also need to consider the possibility that lack of \r\npurpose, of a sense of direction in life, could be a force \r\nthat drives many, especially the young, into the snare of \r\nideologies that appear to offer certainty.\r\nMyanmar advocates a world free of nuclear weapons. \r\nThe annual resolution tabled by my country on nuclear \r\ndisarmament aims at achieving peace and security \r\nfor present and future generations. Establishment of \r\nnuclear-weapon-free zones in different parts of the \r\nworld contributes to this goal. I am happy to inform \r\nthe Assembly that we will be depositing our instrument \r\nof ratification of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban \r\nTreaty this afternoon.\r\nWe have known the cost of contention and suffered \r\nthe wounds of strife. It is something that we do not wish \r\nfor anybody or any country in our world. I would like \r\nto thank all those who have helped us along our road \r\nto build a truly democratic federal union. It has been a \r\nhard road and we have been helped by compassion, by \r\nloving kindness and by understanding. We would like to \r\nsee these qualities displayed more often in addressing \r\nthe problems of our world today. I have witnessed too \r\nmuch anger, hatred, resentment, and demands for rather \r\nthan offers of service. We would like our world to be a \r\nkinder world, one that places giving above receiving.\r\nWe are taught in Burma that the causes of corruption \r\nare greed, anger, fear and ignorance. I am not talking \r\nof corruption as simply the offering or taking of bribes, \r\nbut rather the corruption of human nature. Anger, \r\ngreed, fear and ignorance corrupt human nature, and \r\nas a result our whole world is corrupted. I would like \r\nto call on all to help us in making the world a truly \r\nbetter place for us to live in, and for our grandchildren \r\nand great-grandchildren to live in. Where but in this \r\ngathering of nations can I make such an appeal? So, \r\nI appeal to all to stand up against anger and hatred, \r\nagainst fear and ignorance, and to find a way to build a \r\nbetter world through our capacity for compassion and \r\nloving kindness, and our ability to be happy in the good \r\nfortune of others.\r\nAddress by Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister \r\nof Japan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Japan.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Shinzo Abe, Prime \r\nMinister of Japan, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Abe (Japan) (spoke in Japanese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): North Korea has now \r\nopenly shown itself to be a threat to peace. How must \r\nwe respond? The raison d’être of the United Nations \r\nis now being seriously challenged. North Korea \r\nhas tested submarine-launched ballistic missiles. \r\nImmediately after that, it fired three ballistic missiles \r\nsimultaneously, each traversing 1,000 kilometres to \r\nreach Japan’s exclusive economic zone. It is purely \r\na matter of good fortune that no commercial aircraft \r\nor ships suffered any damage during that incident. \r\nThis year alone, North Korea has launched a total \r\nof 21 ballistic missiles. In addition, it claims to have \r\nsuccessfully detonated a nuclear warhead in a test on \r\n9 September. That nuclear test followed another test \r\nconducted in January. That series of missile launches \r\nand the detonation of a warhead completely changes \r\nthe landscape.\r\nNorth Korea’s nuclear development and the \r\nrepeated launches of ballistic missiles are two sides of \r\nthe same coin. Before our very eyes, North Korea is \r\ncarrying out a plan that is plain to see. It is clear that \r\nthe threat has now reached a new dimension. We must \r\ntherefore respond in a manner entirely distinct from our \r\nresponses thus far. We must act in unison and thwart \r\nNorth Korea’s plans.\r\nImmediately upon hearing the report of the \r\nnuclear test, I telephoned President Barack Obama \r\nof the United States. After that I also held telephone \r\ntalks with President Park Geun-hye of the Republic of \r\nKorea. We all agreed that our three countries would \r\ncollaborate closely and show resolve in our attitude \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 43/48\r\ntowards North Korea. Now is the time for the United \r\nNations to act. Now is the time for the Security Council \r\nto adopt an unambiguous position regarding the \r\nunprecedented threat.\r\nIt was only four months ago that President Obama \r\nvisited Hiroshima, where countless innocent citizens fell \r\nvictim to the first atomic bomb ever detonated. It was a \r\nday on which we renewed pledges. No matter how long \r\nit takes, we must never, even for the briefest moment, \r\nlet up in our efforts to secure the total elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons. On that day, our pledges linked both \r\nsides of the Pacific and gained new strength. This \r\nnotwithstanding, North Korea is now escalating its \r\nprovocations. It is a challenge that we cannot overlook, \r\nas to do so would weigh on our collective conscience.\r\nPeace is much like glass — when polished and \r\ntransparent, we do not see it. A small crack can be \r\noverlooked for a while without changing, but before \r\nyou know it, the crack expands and one day the glass \r\nshatters resoundingly. That is why, day in and day out, \r\nwe must habituate ourselves to handling glass with great \r\ncare, so that no cracks form. I believe that the original \r\nintention of the United Nations, created in the wake of \r\ntwo world wars, was that kind of keen awareness. For \r\nthat very reason, it would simply be unacceptable to \r\ncontinue to tolerate military provocation, because that \r\nwould be equivalent to openly cracking the glass.\r\nMoreover, the threat to peace now plainly manifests \r\nitself, and North Korea’s persistent military provocations \r\nare far more serious than before. North Korea is, without \r\na doubt, poised to acquire submarine-launched ballistic \r\nmissiles with nuclear warheads. Let us not forget that \r\nthis is a country that abducted a large number of Japanese \r\ncitizens, including a 13 year-old girl, shattering their \r\npeaceful lives, and to date they have not been allowed \r\nto return to their homeland. We have demanded that \r\nNorth Korea return them immediately, but they have \r\nrefused. This is a country that tramples human rights, \r\nwhere the checks and balances of power are ignored. It \r\nis a country that continues to build up its arsenal, which \r\nincludes missiles and nuclear weapons, while paying \r\nno attention to the plight of its citizens. The threat to \r\nthe international community has become increasingly \r\ngrave and real. It calls for innovative responses that are \r\naltogether different from previous approaches.\r\nIn December, Japan will mark the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of its entry into the United Nations. \r\nSixty-two years have elapsed, if we count from the \r\nmoment that the toll of the bronze Peace Bell sent by \r\na Japanese citizen began sounding in the front gardens \r\nof the United Nations grounds on the International Day \r\nof Peace, as it does every year. The bell was cast by \r\nmelting down coins sent by Pope Pius XII and coins \r\nand medals sent by children and adults from more than \r\n60 countries around the world. What was the wish of \r\nthe Japanese people that accompanied it?\r\nSixty years ago, when Japan was first seated in \r\nthis Hall, it wholeheartedly advocated world peace \r\nand the elimination of nuclear weapons, as it has \r\ndone consistently and unfailingly ever since. It was a \r\npledge designed to be passed down from generation to \r\ngeneration, a pledge not to stop walking along the path \r\nthat would make world peace and the elimination of \r\nnuclear weapons a reality.\r\nOn this occasion today, I had originally intended to \r\nlook back at the path we have trodden these 60 years and \r\nquietly reflect on Japan’s progress along that road, with \r\nworld peace and prosperity as its goals. However, the \r\nNorth Korea threat is reaching a new level. Therefore, \r\nin the light of Japan having upheld its pledge these 60 \r\nyears, and as the world focuses on whether the United \r\nNations will thwart North Korea’s ambitions or the \r\nSecurity Council will be able to confront North Korea in \r\na united way, I feel I must state that Japan, as a Security \r\nCouncil member, will lead the Council’s discussions. \r\nI declare before the national representatives gathered \r\nhere in the General Assembly Hall that this is our \r\nabsolute resolve. No matter the issue before us, or how \r\nmany challenges we are faced with, Japan, as it marks \r\nits sixtieth year of membership, will spare no effort to \r\nstrengthen the United Nations.\r\nThe cumulative total of the assessed contributions \r\nto the United Nations and the assessed contributions \r\nto peacekeeping operations that Japan has paid, when \r\ntheir book value is tallied, easily exceeds $20 billion. \r\nThe only country whose total financial contributions \r\nsurpasses that of Japan over the past 30 years is \r\nthe United States. In addition, our track record of \r\ndevelopment assistance amounts to $334.5 billion, \r\nagain in terms of the book value.\r\nAs I see it, the United Nations has historically been \r\ncommitted to three great causes: devotion to peace, \r\nthe pursuit of growth, and the desire for a world free \r\nof injustice and unfairness. I believe members will \r\nrecognize that Japan is a country that has made all-out \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n44/48 16-29421\r\nefforts to promote all three of those causes over the past \r\n60 years.\r\nGrowth serves as the foundation for all else. \r\nOnly when there is growth does peace take root and \r\ncan injustices be rectified over time. Take a look and \r\nsee how greater Asia has now surpassed every other \r\nregion as regards the size of its population living under \r\ndemocracy. This is precisely the fruit of the growth \r\nthat Asia has been enjoying since the mid-1980s, \r\nwhich happens also to be the time at which Japanese \r\ncompanies began their large-scale direct investments in \r\nAsian nations.\r\nIt was only through a free and open trade and \r\ninvestment environment that Japan was able to \r\ngrow — the very same environment that is responsible \r\nfor the present-day prosperity of the countries of Asia. \r\nPeace, stability and safety at sea, together with freedom \r\nof navigation and overflight, are the basis for the peace \r\nand prosperity of the international community.\r\nIn the event of disputes, the international community \r\nmust adhere strictly to the principle that States shall \r\nmake their claims based on international law, shall not \r\nuse force or coercion in support of their claims and \r\nshall seek to settle disputes by peaceful means. Japan \r\nwill unfailingly continue to uphold a world order that \r\nis open, free and unwavering in its commitment to the \r\nrule of law and international norms.\r\nLet me also say that at the core of the Japanese \r\nGovernment I have formed a special team, which I \r\nlead directly, that is working to further the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nThe Government of Japan will accelerate the \r\nwork towards early conclusion of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change and will carry out without fail \r\nits pledge to provide ¥1.3 trillion in assistance for \r\ndeveloping countries by 2020. I will make sure that this \r\nwill be done.\r\nJapan will spare no effort in strengthening the \r\nUnited Nations in the 60 years to come, just as it did \r\nover the past 60 years. I wish to pledge this, grounded \r\nin trust in the Japanese people.\r\nAn unexpected visitor appeared at a worksite in \r\nJuba, South Sudan, where members of an engineering \r\nunit belonging to the Japan Ground Self-Defense Force \r\n(SDF) and wearing the blue helmets of the United \r\nNations were carrying out activities. He said to them,\r\n“I am really thankful that Japan is building roads. \r\nI place my full confidence in you. Isn’t there \r\nanything I can do? Let me help you. I don’t need \r\nanything in return.”\r\nAgain the next day, and the day after that, the man \r\nappeared at the worksite, where an arterial road was \r\nbeing laid in the capital of South Sudan, the youngest \r\nMember of the United Nations. On the third day, the man \r\nbegan doing the work that he knew would be necessary, \r\nand he continued working with the members of the SDF \r\nfor eight days. When they went their separate ways, as \r\nthey were patting each other on the back and expressing \r\nregret that they had to part, it goes without saying that \r\nour engineering unit members, who had heard nothing \r\nbut words of thanks from this man, were deeply moved. \r\nJuma Ago Isaac — the SDF members each wrote the \r\nname of this otherwise unknown man from South \r\nSudan in their notebooks to remember him.\r\nNo matter what the job or where it is, the Japanese \r\nengaged in international cooperation always consider \r\nthis kind of encounter at local worksites to be their \r\nreal reward. Wherever they go, nameless people \r\nbecome aware of their own abilities and realize that \r\nnation-building begins at the very place where they \r\nthemselves are standing. The Japanese witnessing this \r\nare moved in ways that become memories lasting their \r\nentire lives.\r\nIt is a source of quiet pride for me that the relationship \r\nbetween Japan and the United Nations has for the past \r\n60 years brought hearts together in this way in Asia, in \r\nAfrica and indeed all around the world. This is Japan’s \r\nUnited Nations spirit. I pledge not to forget this and to \r\nfoster it and hand it down to the next generation.\r\nI will end my address by pointing out the need for \r\nfundamental changes in the United Nations governance \r\nstructure. Countries in Africa and Latin America have \r\nbuilt up a degree of influence they never had before \r\nin global politics and the global economy, and yet they \r\ndo not have satisfactory representation on the Security \r\nCouncil. This single example makes the present \r\ncomposition of the Security Council indefensible to \r\nthe current generation. The international relations \r\nthat prevailed 71 years ago, at the end of the Second \r\nWorld War, are now relegated to the history books. \r\nThey hold no relevance for the countries that have since \r\nthen achieved their independence. At the sixth Tokyo \r\nInternational Conference for African Development, \r\nwhich Japan and the countries of Africa recently \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 45/48\r\nconvened, I heard the leaders describe the fact that \r\nAfrica has no permanent representation on the Security \r\nCouncil as a historical injustice, and I concurred in \r\ndeep agreement.\r\nAfrica’s long-term goal is to have permanent \r\nmembers on the Security Council by 2023, which Japan \r\nthoroughly supports. If we do not carry out a reform \r\nof the Security Council now, it may well be put off \r\nfor another decade or two. Which position are we to \r\ntake — that of undermining the values of the United \r\nNations, or that of striving to strengthen the United \r\nNations? If we choose the latter, then it goes without \r\nsaying that Security Council reform is a matter of \r\nurgency. I will end my address here by emphasizing \r\nthat point.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Japan \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Shinzo Abe, Prime Minister of Japan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Milo Ðukanović, Prime \r\nMinister of Montenegro\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Montenegro.\r\nMr. Milo Ðukanović, Prime Minister of Montenegro, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Milo Ðukanović, Prime \r\nMinister of Montenegro, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Ðukanović (Montenegro) (spoke in \r\nMontenegrin; interpretation provided by the \r\ndelegation): It is an honour for me to address the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of Montenegro and to once again \r\nreaffirm the unequivocal commitment of my country to \r\nthe United Nations. \r\nAt the outset, allow me to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji on his election as \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its seventy-first session. \r\nWe welcome the theme chosen for this sessin, in the \r\nlight of the universal importance of implementing the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). I would also \r\nlike to thank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, \r\nPresident of the Assembly at its seventieth session, for \r\nhis leadership and his many efforts invested in creating \r\nprerequisites for the efficient implementation of crucial \r\nagreements on sustainable development and climate \r\nchange.\r\nThis is the last general debate for Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon. I would like to express my particular \r\nappreciation to him for his essential contributions \r\naimed at building a safer and more prosperous world, \r\nespecially in the light of the past decade, one tarnished \r\nby myriad challenges and crises. It could not have been \r\neasy to lead the Organization in such conditions.\r\nDespite the progress made in many areas, the \r\ncurrent global situation raises many concerns. In \r\nmany places around the world, peace, stability and \r\nsustainable economic development are still proving \r\nunattainable. Brutal and long-term conflicts have taken \r\ntheir toll on hundreds and thousands of individuals, \r\ndestroying millions of people’s lives, the majority of \r\nwhom are women and children. Extreme poverty, weak \r\ninstitutions and serious breaches of human rights are \r\nstill the harsh reality for a large number of people \r\naround the world. Fundamental pillars of international \r\nlaw are being violated by non-State stakeholders, \r\nand violent extremism and terrorism induce constant \r\ninstability, leading to millions of people being forced \r\nto leave their homes. Other countries’ willingness to \r\nadmit them is becoming increasingly uncertain, and \r\nthe humanitarian funds raised are insufficient to meet \r\nthose people’s basic needs.\r\nIn the current situation, where increasingly \r\ncomplex challenges know no boundaries and where no \r\ncountry is able to cope alone, we are compelled to turn \r\nto the United Nations, a world Organization like no \r\nother, where collective solutions can be reached. It is \r\nencouraging that the past few years have been marked \r\nby historic multilateral agreements, paving the way for \r\nglobal transformation and sustainable progress. That is a \r\nreflection of the general willingness to change the status \r\nquo. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change and the Sendai \r\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 carry \r\nsignificant importance and are characterized by their \r\ninterdependence. It is time to assume our responsibility \r\nand commit to their implementation, so that all citizens \r\nhave an equal chance to live a dignified life without \r\nviolence, discrimination or extreme poverty.\r\nMontenegro, despite its size and small share in \r\nglobal emissions, has been committed to implementing \r\nthe agreements I mentioned through sustainable \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n46/48 16-29421\r\ndevelopment initiatives, even though its contribution \r\nmay be small. Montenegro is one of 22 Members of the \r\nUnited Nations to have presented a voluntary national \r\nreport on the implementation and monitoring of the \r\n2030 Agenda and SDGs at the High-level Political \r\nForum in July, further proof of that commitment. \r\nMontenegro was also one of the first States to adopt \r\nthe SDGs as part of a national sustainable development \r\nstrategy, in place until 2030. The strategy ensures that \r\nthe principal measures needed to achieve long-term \r\nsustainable development goals in Montenegro have \r\nbeen implemented, while the country has also adhered \r\nto all necessary international commitments in line with \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. The strategy is for the long term \r\nand aims not only to boost the economy and help the \r\nenvironment but also to capitalize on human resources \r\nand social capital. That should lead to prosperous \r\ndevelopment for our country’s citizens.\r\nMontenegro strongly believes that the Paris \r\nAgreement is a foundation on which further efforts \r\nto preserve climate systems can be based, thereby \r\nensuring that all countries, regardless of their stage \r\nof development, progressively raise their ambitions \r\nin order to achieve their final goals. In line with \r\nthe provisions of the Paris Agreement, Montenegro \r\nreaffirms its ambitious contribution, which is to reduce \r\nits own greenhouse-gas emissions by 30 per cent \r\ncompared with those of 1990. We wish to formally \r\nratify that commitment as soon as possible, in order to \r\ninitiate its implementation. \r\nOur commitment to achieving the goals of the \r\nParis Agreement will pose a challenge for our entire \r\nsystem and will need to include all the stakeholders \r\nat the national and local levels of management and in \r\nall segments of society. Like many other countries, \r\nMontenegro will require additional support from the \r\ninternational community and the financial mechanisms \r\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change. I refer primarily to the Green Climate \r\nFund.\r\nToo often the international community is not able \r\nto prevent or end bloodshed, criminal activity and the \r\nsuffering of millions of people around the world. The \r\nconflict in Syria, which has continuously attracted \r\nattention from the international community and the \r\nUnited Nations, is the most tragic illustration of that \r\ninability. Montenegro expresses its deep concern at the \r\nconflict and the deteriorating humanitarian security \r\nsituation, the repercussions of which are felt globally. \r\nWe fully support an urgent cessation of violence and \r\nwish to point out the need for all parties to adhere to \r\ninternational law and United Nations resolutions. It \r\nis unacceptable for the international community to \r\ncondone the war’s atrocities. It is not only morally \r\nunacceptable, but also contradictory to international \r\nlaw. Therefore, in the absence of a political solution, \r\na temporary agreement must be reached that respects \r\nthe principles of international law and that would at \r\nleast alleviate human suffering. Such crimes must not \r\ngo unpunished — their perpetrators have to be held \r\nresponsible for breaches of international law and its \r\nprinciples.\r\nThe role that the Security Council plays in \r\ninternational and hybrid criminal tribunals is of \r\nvital importance. The crises and conflicts in Syria, \r\nIraq, Yemen, Libya, South Sudan and other countries \r\ndemonstrate the importance of finding a long-term, \r\npeaceful solution through political and diplomatic \r\nmeans, which must have supremacy. The fragile \r\nand deteriorating nature of international peace and \r\nsecurity and its ramifications clearly indicate that our \r\ncurrent global approach — that of managing violence \r\nand crisis — must give way to an approach based on \r\nprevention. It is high time to move from rhetoric to \r\naction.\r\nMediation, a very efficient and peaceful way to \r\nprevent conflict, has not been given enough attention, \r\ndespite Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nMontenegro, being fully aware of the importance \r\nof mediation, is organizing a conference next year \r\nto contribute to further enhancing mediation in the \r\nturbulent area of the Mediterranean. Throughout its \r\nhistory, including in its recent past, Montenegro has \r\nbeen affected by numerous conflicts. Our enthusiasm \r\nfor and commitment to mediation f low from our \r\ncommitment to honest dialogue and cooperation. We \r\nbelieve that mediation is the best way to overcome \r\ndifferences, alleviate tension and reach final solutions.\r\nHumankind is facing humanitarian, refugee and \r\nmigrant crises not seen since the Second World War. \r\nWe deem it exceptionally important that the General \r\nAssembly took up this topic through its hosting of \r\nthe high-level plenary meeting on addressing large \r\nmovements of refugees and migrants. We are in favour \r\nof implementing the New York Declaration for Refugees \r\nand Migrants (resolution 71/1).\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.11\r\n16-29421 47/48\r\nWe must not for a moment forget that today the world \r\nis facing the constant threat of terrorism and violent \r\nextremism. Terrorist attacks worldwide and the killing \r\nof civilians remind us that we have made only limited \r\nprogress in dealing with this complex and evolving \r\nphenomenon, and that more resolute efforts, unity, \r\ncoordination and a more active role by every individual \r\nState Member of the United Nations are required. Our \r\nactions to counter terrorism must focus on preventive \r\nmeasures and on the social, economic and political \r\nsituation. More especially, they must target vulnerable \r\nand marginalized groups, because people susceptible to \r\nradicalism are primarily recruited from these groups. \r\nThe implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals is the best chance to make a positive difference \r\nin this respect. Emphasis must be placed on youth and \r\ntheir empowerment, primarily through employment \r\nand education.\r\nIn a year that marks the tenth anniversary of \r\nthe establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nand the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of two \r\nkey international instruments on human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, the United Nations is facing \r\nmajor challenges with regard to human rights protection \r\nand overwhelming humanitarian crises. Therefore, it \r\nis necessary to reaffirm the strong commitment of all \r\nMember States to the multilateral system of protection \r\nand promotion of human rights. The full and immediate \r\napplication of high standards in the protection of human \r\nrights and the translation of international norms into \r\npractice in every Member State, without exception, are \r\nthe prerequisites for peace, stability and development. \r\nThe United Nations and its Member States should make \r\na much greater effort so that all rights, not only civic and \r\npolitical rights but also economic and social rights, are \r\nguaranteed in order to build the necessary conditions to \r\nensure that no one is left behind in the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThe integration of human rights into development \r\npolicies, especially public policies protecting the rights \r\nof the most vulnerable groups at the national level, is a \r\nnecessary step for effective protection. In that context, \r\nthe consistent application of the principles of sustainable \r\nand inclusive growth in the implementation of economic \r\ngrowth strategies is a necessary precondition for \r\ncombating poverty and social exclusion.\r\nIn order for the United Nations to maintain and \r\nstrengthen its central position in the system of global \r\ngovernance, the Organization must undergo reforms and \r\nadapt to the circumstances of the twenty-first century \r\nand to modern democratic principles. The priority in \r\nthat regard remains a comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in order to enhance its efficiency and \r\ntransparency.\r\nThe Delivering as One approach, which Montenegro \r\nis also applying, has already delivered positive results \r\nin the cooperation between the Organization and \r\nhost countries. It should therefore be further refined, \r\nespecially in the context of the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nMontenegro welcomes the changes introduced as \r\na result of the negotiations on the role of the General \r\nAssembly in the process of selecting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. They will help to strengthen transparency and \r\ncompetitiveness and ensure a merit-based approach. \r\nMontenegro is proud to have put forward a candidate \r\nfor the most responsible position in the United \r\nNations system. We have thereby made a qualitative \r\nand quantitative contribution to the selection of the \r\nbest candidate. At the same time, this also confirms \r\nour readiness to contribute even more actively to the \r\nuniversal goals of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nOn this occasion, I want to express the hope and \r\nexpectation that the new Secretary-General will come \r\nfrom one of the Eastern European countries, given the \r\nneed to respect the principle of regional rotation and the \r\nfact that our geographical group is the only one never to \r\nhave provided the Secretary-General to date.\r\nMontenegro marked the tenth anniversary of its \r\nmembership in the United Nations on 28 June. This \r\nwas a historic day for our country. It was the greatest \r\nconfirmation of independence, restored Montenegrin \r\nstatehood, a signal that we have taken our rightful \r\nplace in the world family of nations. Since regaining \r\nindependence, we are continuously strengthening our \r\nState in accordance with the European Euro-Atlantic \r\nstandard, and I am pleased to note that Montenegro \r\nis today an example of stability, multi-ethnicity and \r\nrespect for differences; a reliable neighbour and a \r\nreliable international partner; and a leader in Euro-\r\nAtlantic integration in the region.\r\nGiven our experience, we know that institutions \r\nare a foundation for the stability of the State and the \r\nrule of law. Integration into NATO and the European \r\nUnion are national strategic priorities. In May this \r\nyear Montenegro signed the NATO accession protocol. \r\nWe believe that the process of ratification of the \r\nA/71/PV.11 21/09/2016\r\n48/48 16-29421\r\nprotocol will be finalized in the short term and that \r\nwe will very soon meet all the formal preconditions \r\nto become a full-f ledged member State of NATO. The \r\nimportance of this historic step for Montenegro will not \r\ndiminish our enthusiasm for the further improvement \r\nof our security, legal and political systems, as NATO \r\nmembership requires. The same applies as regards our \r\nreadiness to contribute to peace and stability in the \r\nregion and beyond.\r\nWe have opened 24 of the requisite 35 chapters in \r\nthe process of our accession to the European Union. \r\nWe are making strides on the path to membership, \r\nreaffirming the potential and capacity of Montenegrin \r\nsociety and its institutions. Montenegro continues to be \r\na reliable and responsible partner for the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations.\r\nMontenegro is a member of the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission. It is also a member of the Executive \r\nBoard of the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the United \r\nNations Office for Project Services. We have been \r\nelected to membership of the Executive Board of UN-\r\nWomen, starting next year. After serving on the Human \r\nRights Council from 2014 to 2016, we submitted our \r\napplication for membership in the Council for the \r\n2022-2024 period. We also presented our candidacy \r\nfor the Security Council for the 2026-2027 period. We \r\nhave expanded our participation in the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions by deploying military observers \r\nto the United Nations Mission for the Referendum in \r\nWestern Sahara.\r\nThe foregoing are indicators that Montenegro \r\nis firmly committed to the promotion of the United \r\nNations and to multilateralism and joint action in order \r\nto guarantee a peaceful, stable, prosperous and equal \r\nworld. We are determined to actively and constructively \r\ncontribute to the efforts of the United Nations in \r\nthis regard.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nMontenegro for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Milo Ðukanović, Prime Minister of Montenegro, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.35 p.m.\r\n"
