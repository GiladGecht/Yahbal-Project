"United Nations A/71/PV.12\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n12th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 21 September 2016, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Nalbandian \r\n(Armenia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Ms. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nCroatia.\r\nMs. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, President of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations Her Excellency Ms. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Croatia, and to invite her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Grabar-Kitarović: “We want a future in \r\nwhich everyone lives a happy life and loves one another”. \r\nThose words were recently written in the Book of Ideas \r\nby a six-year-old boy named Lovro when he visited my \r\noffice along with a number of other children to mark the \r\nbeginning of the new school year in Croatia. But they \r\ncould easily have been written by any child in the world. \r\nIt is a simple, yet powerful, wish. In order to transform \r\nour world, we as leaders must listen to Lovro’s words. \r\nAnd for that reason I want his voice to be heard today \r\nin the General Assembly. Everyone can agree that those \r\nsimple truths, among which are the right to a happy \r\nlife and the freedom of choice, as universal drivers of \r\na better world, are indeed the ultimate objectives of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nA year has passed since we adopted the milestone \r\nAgenda 2030, and we are now one step and one year \r\ncloser to its deadline. Today, in terms of achievements \r\nand responsibilities, I would like to address sustainable \r\ndevelopment by focusing on human potential, natural \r\nresources and resilient societies.\r\nWe have all signed onto the Agenda, our plan of \r\naction for people, planet and prosperity. People should \r\nbe at the heart of our efforts, with youth at the very \r\ncore. Our goal as leaders is to empower our youth \r\nthrough education and give them opportunities to be \r\nthe catalysts of transformation and progress. Now is \r\nthe time to start viewing our youth as the guardians of \r\nAgenda 2030, because in 14 years whatever progress we \r\nhave achieved will be theirs to carry on.\r\nI would agree with many who argue that even \r\ntoday, in 2016, we must decide whether we opt for open \r\nor closed societies. Whatever we do to safeguard the \r\nfuture should be done with determination, with clear \r\nchoices in mind. \r\nThere is much work to be done. We must begin \r\nby restoring public confidence in Governments and \r\ninternational organizations. We must embrace our \r\ncommon values with strength, courage and true \r\nconviction — beginning with tolerance — and become \r\nactive and dedicated builders of a world where there is \r\nno room for despair.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It should be a continuous search for \r\nconsensus, nationally and internationally, and the \r\nactive involvement of all stakeholders in building \r\nnew strategic alliances. There is an evident need for \r\nending the prevailing silo approach, if we are to achieve \r\nsynergies when implementing mutually interdependent \r\ngoals. Security, prosperity and human rights go \r\nhand-in-hand and cannot be separated.\r\nAccording to the latest UNICEF statistics, over \r\n50 million children are currently uprooted, and almost \r\n60 million children do not have access to primary \r\neducation. Those children are counting on us to give \r\nthem the chance they deserve. We should not act only \r\nwhen moved by images, such as those of the Syrian \r\nboys Aylan and Omran, which are true symbols of our \r\nworld gone horribly wrong.\r\nThe optimism and resilience shown by children \r\nand, most of all, their unbridled honesty are qualities \r\nthat I respect and admire. All children should have the \r\nright to their childhood and education. It is devastating \r\nto know how many children could not begin class this \r\nautumn because they are victims of the various global \r\ncrises that we allow to persist.\r\nIn terms of unlocking global human potential, \r\nI believe that if we want to give future generations \r\na chance for a better life by 2030, we must address \r\nthree main, mutually reinforcing, phenomena: \r\nlarge-scale migrations, demographic dynamics and \r\nyouth unemployment. We need a predictable, humane, \r\nresponsible and legally sound system of governing \r\ninternational migration. Croatia commends the New \r\nYork Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution \r\n71/1), which the General Assembly adopted on Monday, \r\nas well as the Agenda for Humanity presented at the \r\nWorld Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul last May. \r\nImplementing them together with Agenda 2030 will \r\nhelp us address the root causes of the large movements \r\nof people. On that issue we need not minimize anyone’s \r\ndignity or rights, nor underestimate the perils that \r\nsurround them.\r\nOur immediate focus should be two-fold. We must \r\nprovide assistance to both the countries of origin and \r\nthe receiving countries in order to promote safe, regular \r\nand orderly migration management. We must promote \r\nglobal efforts to counter organized-crime networks \r\ninvolved in human trafficking. What we have is a \r\nglobal crisis of human mobility and, as such, it requires \r\na global response. \r\nWe must end the policy of double standards and the \r\nhypocritical approach to the tragedy that is unfolding \r\nas we speak. We must help those who have managed to \r\nleave the fields of destruction, but we must also do our \r\nutmost to assist those who have stayed behind and are \r\nleft with no means of or strength to escape.\r\nAll societies, developed and underdeveloped alike, \r\nare currently facing not only one generation, but several \r\ngenerations, of youth that are unemployed, disappointed \r\nand discouraged, while others are trying to escape from \r\nconflict, violence and intolerance. They are extremely \r\nsceptical about their future and become easy prey for \r\nall kinds of manipulation and radicalization.\r\nSocial media and modern communications \r\ntechnology are becoming a double-edged sword. They \r\nprovide us with unparalleled opportunities, making \r\nthe world interconnected in ways that only yesterday \r\nfew dared to dream of. At the same time, they carry \r\nthe dark potential to spread hatred and intolerance \r\nand build invisible walls around those who look or \r\nthink differently. We must pay special attention to \r\nthat possibility and find the prudence to use new \r\ntechnologies to improve not only our daily lives, but \r\nalso our hearts and minds.\r\nEducation, knowledge and tolerance are more than \r\njust the tools of choice when dealing with political and \r\nsocial discrimination, exclusion and the prevention \r\nof violent extremism and terrorism. They are the \r\nway forward. They are the key to success and are \r\nfundamental drivers of sustainable development.\r\nConstant investment in education systems always \r\npays back with big dividends. Ever more countries are \r\nrecognizing the necessity of a comprehensive education \r\nreform, because too many current education systems \r\nare generating youth who cannot find employment. \r\nEducation has the power to multiply opportunities. \r\nIt is an engine that creates choices, providing every \r\nindividual with the freedom to choose a path of his or \r\nher own.\r\nGender inequality is the most pervasive form of \r\nglobal inequality and a pressing human rights concern. \r\nWomen and girls continue to be exposed to a range of \r\nobstacles to their complete and full inclusion in social, \r\neconomic and political life. There will be no real \r\nprogress without a gender-responsive implementation \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 3/25\r\nof Agenda 2030. For us to succeed we need more \r\nwomen in politics and business, in diplomacy and on \r\nexecutive boards. But that will not happen without men. \r\nTheir role in the empowerment of women, their support \r\nand understanding, are as crucial as the will of women \r\nto succeed.\r\nThis year, Croatia is chairing the Equal Futures \r\nPartnership — an innovative multilateral initiative \r\naimed at encouraging Member States to empower \r\nwomen economically and politically. The high-level \r\nmeeting of its members and supporters will take place \r\ntomorrow. I invite all those present to find the time to \r\npay due attention to that endeavour.\r\nNature is just as irreplaceable as people are. \r\nDevelopment strategies must seriously take into \r\naccount our natural resources as the fundamental \r\nstarting point. Climate change is a powerful weapon of \r\nmass destruction that is going out of control. We have \r\nvery little time to reverse that self-destructive course. \r\nClimate change is also a risk multiplier for other \r\nsecurity challenges, including large-scale migrations \r\nand regional instability born out of hopelessness and \r\ndesolation. We must ensure climate action and make \r\nsure that the recent Paris Agreement enters into force \r\nas soon as possible.\r\nAs a country on the northern shores of the \r\nMediterranean, Croatia is following the developments \r\nacross that cradle of our civilization with care and deep \r\nconcern. The southern Mediterranean has, sadly, become \r\na sea of dangerous journeys, where the legendary tales \r\nof the classical world are being replaced by new stories \r\nof human suffering, where ancient monuments are \r\nbeing reduced to dust and where indifference to human \r\nlife sometimes reaches an unimaginable scale. The \r\nstability, security and well-being of the Mediterranean \r\nremain a priority of Croatian foreign policy.\r\nOur societies are exposed to a complex global security \r\nenvironment with increased mutual dependencies. \r\nThere is a whole range of hybrid threats to national and \r\ninternational security: violent extremism, terrorism, \r\nforeign terrorist fighters, uncontrolled migration, \r\norganized crime, risks related to the cyberenvironment, \r\nand the malicious use of new technologies. Large-scale \r\nmigrations and unemployment are interconnected, just \r\nas failed States and fragile Governments are related to \r\nconflict.\r\nTerrorism continues to represent not only a security \r\nconcern, but also a detrimental economic factor for \r\nevery country, causing millions of people to leave their \r\nhomes in search of safety and prosperity. We need to \r\nstrengthen the resilience of our societies at the grass-\r\nroots level, particularly the fabric of multicultural \r\nand multi-confessional societies, against terrorist \r\npropaganda, attempts at violent radicalization and other \r\nextremist actions. In addition to our efforts to promote \r\nsustainable and long-term de-radicalization and fight \r\nterrorist narratives, especially those in cyberspace, \r\nwe need to address the underlying socioeconomic \r\ndrivers of terrorism, such as poverty, inequality, \r\nunemployment, the lack of education and the lack of \r\neconomic prosperity.\r\nWhen countering global threats that impede \r\nthe emergence and growth of resilient societies, the \r\nissue of disarmament must remain at the forefront. \r\nRecently, we achieved success in the development \r\nand implementation of the Arms Trade Treaty and \r\nthe Convention on Cluster Munitions. At the same \r\ntime, large parts of the United Nations disarmament \r\nmachinery are stalled. The 2015 Review Conference \r\nof Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons remains a case in point. In our quest \r\nfor a more secure global community, we must spare no \r\neffort in the field of the non-proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction. \r\nTwenty years have passed since the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty was opened for signature, but \r\nwe still need to invigorate our determination to become \r\na nuclear-test-free world. New technologies and the \r\nfourth industrial revolution are changing our lives for \r\nthe better in more ways than one. However, they also \r\nhave a negative impact on security and disarmament. \r\nTechnologies such as 3-D printing are changing the \r\nalgorithm in the area of conventional weapons, and \r\nthe misuse of cyberspace might have unforeseen \r\nconsequences in the chemical, biological, radiological \r\nand nuclear areas. We must therefore broaden our reach \r\nwhen it comes to disarmament topics and align it with \r\nnew realities.\r\nCroatia considers participation in international \r\nmissions and operations to be a principal duty that can \r\ncontribute to peace. In that regard, we are preparing \r\nto place the Croatian Army Engineering Horizontal \r\nConstruction Company at the disposal of United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations.\r\nToday, on the International Day of Peace, it is \r\nnecessary to emphasize that women are powerful \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n4/25 16-29453\r\nagents of peace and security. We must not treat women \r\nonly as victims of conflict and violence. Women are \r\npowerful agents of change. Their growing contribution \r\nto the prevention and resolution of conflict, as well as \r\nto the maintenance of a sustainable and inclusive peace, \r\nshould be encouraged. More female peacekeepers \r\ncould help us combat sexual violence, promote gender \r\nawareness among the host nations’ populations and \r\nimprove relationships with local citizens. In order to \r\ncontribute to that goal, Croatia is conducting a United \r\nNations training course for women police officers from \r\nAsia, Africa and Europe. The course is organized back-\r\nto-back with predeployment military training in order to \r\nenhance the synergy between the military and civilian \r\nsectors by integrating the gender and multicultural \r\naspects of peacekeeping.\r\nWe commend the Secretary-General for advancing \r\nthe responsibility to protect. Over the past 10 years, a \r\nlot has been accomplished in building consensus around \r\nthat concept and strengthening the will and capacity \r\nfor its implementation. Croatia advocates the further \r\nstrengthening of the role of the International Criminal \r\nCourt so that it can assume greater responsibility in \r\nprosecuting mass atrocities and war crimes, including \r\ncriminal acts against cultural heritage committed \r\nby State or non-State actors. We believe that it is of \r\nparamount importance to put an end to the culture \r\nof impunity. And that must be done without any \r\npoliticization, without putting daily politics above \r\nthe rule of law and, certainly, without rewriting or \r\nmisinterpreting history.\r\nIt is through hard-earned wisdom that we lave \r\nlearned that there can be no true justice without peace \r\nor peace without justice. Establishing individual \r\naccountability through strong evidential and legal \r\nnorms is essential. International tribunals and judicial \r\nmechanisms can lay the foundations needed to make \r\nthe voices of victims heard and to record volumes of \r\nevidence in the annals of history, but it is up to each \r\nsociety to bring the process of reconciliation to its end.\r\nRespect for, and the protection of, human rights is \r\na prerequisite for sustainable peace and development. \r\nOur work in that area should never end. We strongly \r\nsupport and advocate the Human Rights Up Front \r\ninitiative. Through its candidacy for membership in \r\nthe Human Rights Council for the period 2017-2019, \r\nCroatia looks forward to constructively contributing to \r\nand strengthening the Council’s work in the promotion, \r\nprotection and further development of human rights.\r\nCroatia will continue to be actively engaged in the \r\nUnited Nations reform process. We commend recent \r\nprogress in the process of electing the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral and strengthening the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly. However, the Organization \r\nis still lagging behind in terms of what is expected \r\nconcerning Security Council reform, as highlighted by \r\nthe number of ongoing, prolonged and nascent crises \r\nin the world. We have great expectations for the next \r\nSecretary-General. We hope that she or he will give \r\nbold impetus to the processes of carrying forward \r\nour Organization, making it even more effective, \r\naccountable, transparent and, above all, more relevant.\r\nThe world has been yearning for inspirational \r\nand effective leadership. The solidarity of our global \r\nsociety is deteriorating as problems pile up and hope \r\ndiminishes. Will we accept that we are creating a \r\nworld led by feelings of separation, fear and cynicism \r\nbecause we have allowed violence, injustice and crises \r\nto prevail? Or will we reverse those trends and choose \r\nto achieve a better tomorrow?\r\nFourteen years from now, our children will not ask \r\nus what we planned together or what we signed up to \r\ndo. Instead, they will ask us what we achieved together \r\nand whether we made a difference. And we as leaders \r\nneed therefore to inspire our citizens again and act \r\ntogether today.\r\nI want to end with a message to all of the children \r\nin Croatia and in the world: their voices provide us \r\nwith guidance and serve as an obligation for all of us \r\nwho gather here at this permanent meeting point of \r\nhumankind. Lovro may only be 6 years old, but his \r\nvoice resonates today in the General Assembly Hall, \r\nand he is making a difference.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Croatia for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović, President of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 5/25\r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome His Excellency \r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Medina Sánchez (spoke in Spanish): It \r\nis an honour to participate once again in the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of the people of the Dominican \r\nRepublic. I wish to begin my remarks with a special \r\nrecognition of the work of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon. We appreciate his dedication in the search \r\nfor solutions to the conflicts that have shaken the world \r\nover the past 10 years, and we wish him the best of luck \r\nin the new tasks that he will undertake.\r\nThe year 2016 is proving to be especially turbulent, \r\nwith territorial conflicts and open identity-related \r\ntensions in various parts of the world. We hope and \r\ninsist, of course, that the international community will \r\nfind a peaceful outcome to those conflicts — first and \r\nforemost for the sake of the millions of lives that are \r\naffected by them. Sometimes the urgency inherent in \r\nthose tragedies weakens our commitment to address \r\nproblems that appear to be less pressing but are the \r\nmost important in the long term.\r\nOne such issue, with perhaps the largest scope and \r\ngreatest potential for long-term transformation, is the \r\nfight against poverty and inequality. Over the past two \r\ndecades, the rapid economic growth brought about by \r\neconomic globalization has fuelled high expectations in \r\nthe countries of the South. In fact, it was believed that \r\nthe prosperity enjoyed by a few countries might finally \r\nbe within everyone’s reach. It should be recognized \r\nthat those hopes were not unfounded. Indeed, over the \r\ncourse of those two decades, hundreds of millions of \r\npeople were lifted out of poverty.\r\nBut we cannot let ourselves be carried away by \r\nexcessive optimism. We have an obligation to clarify \r\nthe scope of those gains in the light of the actual data. \r\nWe must also expand our horizons to observe those \r\nplaces and areas where globalization has not kept the \r\npromises made to humankind.\r\nTo begin with, we must remember that all of the \r\nhundreds of millions of people who were recently \r\nlifted out of poverty did not automatically become \r\npart of the middle class, nor did all who were able \r\nto do so necessarily remain there. We have, then, a \r\nnew social segment, a segment that has already been \r\nlifted out of poverty, but whose position is much too \r\nfragile for us to consider it definitive. The word used \r\nto describe the situation of those men and women is \r\n“vulnerability” — vulnerability to unemployment, to \r\nthe illness of a family member, to an economic crisis \r\nor a natural disaster, and vulnerability to a series of \r\nunforeseen events that could ruin their prospects for the \r\nfuture and return them to poverty in just a short time.\r\nThat vulnerable group now includes more than \r\n1.5 billion people around the world, who represent more \r\nthan 22 per cent of the world’s population, according to \r\nUnited Nations statistics. That population is especially \r\nlarge in Latin America and the Caribbean, where the \r\nmajority of people earn between $4 and $10 a day. The \r\nchallenge that we face is to strengthen the position \r\nof that emerging class. We must provide them with \r\nsecurity and give them the tools and skills enabling \r\nthem not only to develop their own lives, but also to \r\nparticipate in the development of their countries.\r\nLet there be no doubt that new social class offers \r\na great opportunity for our nations. Because of its \r\nexpanded capacity for consumption and its ability to \r\nsave, that social class has the potential to become, as \r\nhas already been noted, an economic growth bonus, \r\nsimilar to the so-called demographic boom that our \r\ncountries have seen as well. To bolster the emerging \r\nmiddle class will require more complex and better-\r\nquality products in all sectors, from infrastructure to \r\neducation. The path of that class to progress will enable \r\nour countries and the entire world to progress.\r\nBut in order to realize all of that potential, we must \r\nstrengthen the safety nets and social supports in the areas \r\nof health, education, employment and social security, \r\nso as to keep vulnerable individuals from falling back \r\ninto poverty. If we take that opportunity, not only can \r\nthose men and women leave their difficulties behind \r\nforever, but they can also convert their countries into \r\nmiddle class, democratic and peaceful societies with \r\nless need to emigrate abroad. In other words, they can \r\nbe the key to far-reaching changes on our continent.\r\nWithin the framework of the Assembly, the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment with its Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nprovides a good road map for many of the challenges \r\nthat we face in Latin America, the Caribbean and the \r\nworld. Our country believes that it is important to work \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n6/25 16-29453\r\nevery day to reduce suffering and to develop strategies \r\nto ensure that the path out of poverty is a path of no \r\nreturn. However, in order to accomplish those goals, \r\nin order to lift people out of poverty — hundreds of \r\nmillions of people — more is needed than merely \r\nadopting a series of formulas and indicators.\r\nProfound changes must urgently be made to \r\nthe methods by which trade and financial f lows are \r\ncarried out. That is to say, it is necessary to revise \r\nthe rules of the game between rich countries and poor \r\ncountries. We are talking about trade. We live in an \r\nage of unprecedented trade openness. My country, \r\nthe Dominican Republic, like many others, has signed \r\nfree trade agreements with the major economic blocs, \r\nwhich ought to be mutually beneficial — and in many \r\ncases they are. However, if I may say so in all honesty, \r\nthere are times when the developed countries engage \r\nin hypocrisy. After more than half a century in which \r\nthose countries were protected from everything that \r\nother countries were able to produce better, now those \r\ncountries refuse to reduce protectionism within their \r\nborders, whereas under the free trade agreements they \r\nrequire that from their counterparts in developing \r\ncountries. They want us, the developing countries, to \r\neliminate our protections on industrial goods, but they \r\ndo not eliminate agricultural subsidies.\r\nFor the next five years, for example, the United \r\nStates will provide an average of $97.8 billion \r\nannually to support its agricultural sector, and in its \r\nmulti-year subsidy policy for the period 2014-2020, the \r\nEuropean Union will devote €408 billion to subsidize \r\nits agricultural sector. The agricultural protectionism \r\npractised by rich countries allows them to influence the \r\nmarket in their favour, while tariffs and trade barriers \r\nroutinely exclude products from developing countries.\r\nIn addition, other non-tariff barriers, such as \r\nphytosanitary regulations, are not transparent; they \r\nalso create additional barriers to farmers in developing \r\ncountries seeking to enter the global market. The \r\ndeveloped countries have allowed those market \r\ndistortions to persist and have continued to make \r\nrhetorical statements in favour of free trade. They \r\nshould, rather, take concrete steps to attain the ideal of \r\ngenuine free and fair trade.\r\nRecently, countries such as ours that have signed \r\non to free trade agreements have been forced to revise \r\nthe terms of our existing agreements because of such \r\nprotectionist practices that create situations of unequal \r\ncompetition. If the industrialized countries want to \r\nbe true to their word, they must agree to significantly \r\nreduce their protectionism and their subsidies during \r\ncurrent trade negotiations and, at the same time, ensure \r\nincreased funding for rural development.\r\nJust as we should seek greater fairness in trade, we \r\nmust also ensure that financial f lows serve as partners \r\nof development and productivity. For some time now, \r\nwe have been living in an economy where the financial \r\nsector is becoming increasingly important. That is a \r\nreality that brings as many opportunities as dangers. \r\nWe were all able to see, for example, how a purely \r\nfinancial crisis like the one that broke out in the 2008, \r\nfollowing the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, was able \r\nto jeopardize years or decades of development efforts \r\nin many of our countries.\r\nWe have also had the opportunity to confirm \r\nhow the free movement of capital can be used for \r\nthe purposes of tax evasion or money-laundering. \r\nThe Dominican Republic, like many of the countries \r\npresent in the Assembly today, can only benefit from \r\nmore stable, predictable and better regulated financial \r\nmarkets. Therefore, this year, we have begun to adopt \r\nthe anti-money laundering recommendations of the \r\nFinancial Action Task Force of Latin America. Those \r\nmeasures include greater supervision of financial \r\ninstitutions, greater transparency of the legal status of \r\npersons, ensuring the legitimate ownership of assets, \r\nmonitoring wire transfers, documenting retention \r\npolicies, creating a framework for international \r\ncooperation and providing mutual legal assistance, \r\namong other measures, for making the Dominican \r\nbanking system safer and more transparent.\r\nIt is worth noting that news such as the recent \r\nEuropean Union ruling ordering the technology \r\ncompany Apple to pay €13 billion in unpaid taxes \r\nplainly demonstrates a reality that we have long known, \r\nnamely, that tax havens do not necessarily exist only \r\nin sunny Caribbean countries. Quite the contrary, the \r\ngreat majority are under the jurisdiction of the richest \r\ncountries. Moreover, contrary to the widespread idea \r\nthat tax havens are merely places to conceal money, they \r\nare primarily platforms from which to conduct financial \r\nand trade operations in global capital markets. That is \r\nto say, it is not money stowed under the mattress but \r\nrather an integral part of the real economy that siphons \r\nresources from it and robs States of their prerogative of \r\nfiscal sovereignty.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 7/25\r\nThe lack of regulation has paved the way for tax \r\nevaders and has made the work of tax authorities \r\nmore complex. It constitutes a major threat to State \r\nfunding worldwide, which undermines the ability of \r\nGovernments to meet their enormous responsibilities \r\nto their citizens. We therefore applaud any initiatives \r\nthat promote greater regulation of tax havens. We also \r\nknow that the regulation of tax havens must be part and \r\nparcel of a larger system of effective public regulation \r\nand monitoring of financial markets, so that they can \r\nserve the real economy and its citizens.\r\nIt is our responsibility to continue to try to lift \r\nmillions of people out of poverty, but we must do \r\nso by setting education, health, employment and \r\nsocial-security policies that build on past successes \r\nand enable us to forge ahead. We will continue to \r\nbe committed to the global exchange of goods and \r\nservices, but let us ensure that those exchanges are fair \r\nand on a level playing field. We will open the f loodgates \r\nof investment, thereby multiplying possibilities for \r\nproduction, research and growth, but let us also ensure \r\nfairness and transparency so that, in the medium and \r\nlong term, our investment and growth will be in the \r\nservice of the vast majority rather than a select few.\r\nLet us build the necessary consensus to humanize \r\nthe global economy. Let us bring the openness that we \r\ndemand in finance to the regulation of migration f lows. \r\nLet us use the same creativity and enthusiasm that \r\nwe bring to launching lucrative businesses to finding \r\nsolutions for those most in need. The millions of people \r\nwho have recently emerged from poverty are the best \r\nproof that great things can be achieved when there \r\nis political will. Those millions of men and women \r\nare also our best partners and the primary reason to \r\ncontinue our work. We have made great strides, but \r\nthere is a long road ahead of us. The steps ahead will \r\nrequire boldness and honesty. We must do away with \r\ntaboos, rethink paradigms and redefine the rules of \r\nthe game. Our country is committed to substantially \r\nreducing inequalities, but not only between the richest \r\nand poorest inhabitants of our countries, but also in \r\nreshaping the international relations between poor and \r\nrich countries.\r\nLet us sit together for a dialogue based on mutual \r\nrespect, equality and for the common good, without any \r\nprivileges. Let us do so convinced that that is the only \r\nway that humankind can prevail. The time of zero-sum \r\ngames is over. It is time for all of us to add value. It \r\nis time to form alliances that seek to build and where \r\nall allies are equal. The international community can \r\nalways count on the Dominican Republic to help along \r\nthat path and to work in the service of the vast majority, \r\nwho needs us.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDominican Republic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Danilo Medina Sánchez, President of the \r\nDominican Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of \r\nthe Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Democratic \r\nSocialist Republic of Sri Lanka.\r\nMr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Maithripala Sirisena, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri \r\nLanka, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident Sirisena (spoke in Sinhalese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): I am extremely happy \r\nto take part in the seventy-first session of the General \r\nAssembly as the President of Sri Lanka.\r\nI would like to convey the current situation in \r\nmy country. For the past 20 months, my leadership \r\nhas helped usher in a new era of social, political and \r\neconomic transformations in my country. Before I came \r\nto power, people in my country were living in fear and \r\nsuspicion. I have laid the foundation for strengthening \r\nthe rule of law and restoring democratic rights for the \r\npeople of Sri Lanka so that they can live happily in a \r\nfree and democratic society. My Government seeks \r\nto make the people of Sri Lanka among the happiest \r\npeople on Earth. To that end, we have taken steps to \r\nstrengthen freedom and democracy while achieving \r\neconomic prosperity. The Government is committed to \r\nmaking the people of Sri Lanka a developed nation.\r\nPoverty is a global challenge. I am determined \r\nto alleviate poverty in my country. I have therefore \r\ndeclared 2017 to be the Year of Eliminating Poverty in \r\nSri Lanka. I have developed a basic platform to help \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n8/25 16-29453\r\npeople emerge from poverty in a country that prioritizes \r\neconomic progress. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment serves as the guiding principles for all \r\nnations and institutions, led by the United Nations, to \r\nbring about the economic, social and environmental \r\ntransformations that will make the world a better place. \r\nIn that regard, we recognize that economic development \r\nplays a key role, and that environmental sustainability, \r\nparticularly the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \r\nwill remain a main pillar in our endeavour to bring \r\nabout the necessary changes in my country. With the \r\neducated younger generations in mind, Sri Lanka’s \r\nnational development strategy will give prominence \r\nto building a green and innovation-based economy \r\nthrough progressive reforms and planning.\r\nAs an island nation, Sri Lanka wishes to make \r\nmaximum use of its ocean resources, with a new \r\nemphasis on ocean research, tourism, fisheries and \r\nmarine resources. The Government seeks to further \r\nimprove the free health-care and education systems, \r\nwhile providing greater technology to agriculture and \r\ndomestic industry, so as to ensure that our people live \r\nbetter lives.\r\nIn many parts of the world, we see the unfortunate \r\nproliferation of anger, hatred, brutality and conflict. I \r\nwould say that contemporary society is experiencing a \r\ncrisis of morality. I believe that all States should heed \r\nthe cry for moral values and that every society must \r\ndedicate itself to raising the level of positive moral \r\nvalues.\r\nSri Lanka is a Buddhist country where Theravada \r\nBuddhism is practiced. The teachings of the Buddha \r\nhelp us find solutions to many of the burning issues of \r\nthe contemporary world. Similarly, I am sure that the \r\nwisdom offered by the great world religions — such as \r\nChristianity, Hinduism, Islam and others — can help us \r\ntoday. I am therefore of the view that we as States must \r\nstrengthen and foster those religions and philosophies \r\nthat help us look inward.\r\nI take this opportunity to draw the attention of \r\nthis gathering to a significant obstacle in our progress \r\nas the world community, that is, the menace of drugs \r\nand intoxicants that has beset society, including youth \r\nand schoolchildren. As the President of Brazil pointed \r\nout (see A/71/PV.8), illicit drugs have become the \r\nmost serious challenge faced by society today. While \r\nendorsing his ideas, I would urge the world community, \r\nthe United Nations and all States to commit to fighting \r\nillegal drugs collectively and individually through a \r\nrobust international programme that is more organized \r\nand stronger than the one currently in place.\r\nOn the domestic front, my Government has taken \r\neffective measures to strengthen democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw and good governance, paving the way for positive \r\nchange to ensure that war will never again take place \r\non the soil of my country, Sri Lanka. The reconciliation \r\nprocess under way today has taken lessons learned from \r\nthe bitter experience of a brutal war that lasted three \r\ndecades. The process will ensure that my country will \r\nnever again see the cruelty of war or terrorism and that \r\nall communities will live peacefully in a rational and \r\na free-thinking Sri Lanka. For that noble purpose, Sri \r\nLanka welcomes the collaboration and blessings that it \r\nhas received from international organizations and the \r\ninternational community.\r\nSri Lanka is a free, independent nation, and I \r\nintend to preserve and protect its sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity, in line with the policies of all of \r\nthe other nations gathered here today. As such, my \r\ncountry will seek its own recipe for the reconciliation \r\nprocess and the necessary transformation and reform \r\nefforts, based on respect for the essential indigenous \r\nthinking of the local people. Sri Lanka will adhere \r\nto a social democratic policy and work closely with \r\nthe international community towards prosperity and \r\nwisdom, in line with the rest of the world. \r\nFollowing the war that traumatized the nation for \r\nthree decades, we have started the journey towards \r\nnational reconciliation and lasting peace. However, we \r\nwill not hurry; rather, we will tread each step with care, \r\nvigilance, patience and persistence. My beloved Sri \r\nLanka has big dreams. I look forward to the blessings \r\nand collaboration of Member States to achieve them.\r\nI thank the United Nations and its agencies for \r\nthe ongoing support provided to Sri Lanka. I am \r\nhonoured to mention the contributions made by the \r\noutgoing Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, in \r\nfostering international development and strengthening \r\ndemocracy and human rights. Those efforts are a \r\nblessing to humankind.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to emphasize my commitment \r\nto empowering our youth with the best knowledge in \r\nthe world. We are also embarking upon a reconciliation \r\nprogramme, with a view to Sri Lanka becoming an \r\nexemplary democracy in the world. My Government \r\nwill fulfil its responsibilities towards its people, and \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 9/25\r\nI seek Member States’ assistance and blessings in that \r\nnoble endeavour.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Maithripala Sirisena, President of the \r\nDemocratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, was \r\nescorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Peter M. Christian, President \r\nand Head of Government of the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President and Head of Government of \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia.\r\nMr. Peter M. Christian, President and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Peter M. Christian, \r\nPresident and Head of Government of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Christian: As Mr. Peter Thomson of \r\nFiji assumes the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session, I wish to recognize that \r\nhistoric occasion for Pacific islanders, and express my \r\ncongratulations to him and his country. I would also \r\nlike to thank outgoing President Mogens Lykketoft \r\nfor his leadership during the General Assembly at \r\nits seventieth session, during which I made my first \r\nappearance here at the United Nations. At that time, \r\nI said that holding on to the podium gave me a sense \r\nof security and hope that all of us were thinking in the \r\nsame direction (see A/70/PV.22).\r\nAfter 10 years of service, Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon deserves great praise for his effective \r\nleadership, during which he championed many issues \r\nimportant to small island developing States, including \r\ngenerating the political momentum needed to address \r\nclimate change and his push to catalyse the initial \r\ncapitalization of the Green Climate Fund. Sadly, \r\nthe funds, generously contributed, have been slow \r\nin f lowing to needy States, thereby contributing to \r\npainful delays in the implementation of mitigation and \r\nadaptation projects.\r\nThe Federated States of Micronesia today \r\ncelebrates its twenty-fifth year of membership in the \r\nOrganization. At the time we joined, following the end \r\nof the Cold War, there was a great sense of optimism \r\nthat the long-standing obstacles to world peace and \r\nprogress had been relegated to the past. Today, while \r\nthere has been progress towards the great goals of the \r\nOrganization, it must be said without hesitation that \r\nmuch remains to be done.\r\nThe reform of our United Nations, most important \r\nthat of the Security Council, has remained on the \r\nagenda now for a quarter of a century, which evokes \r\ncharacteristics of an era that needs forgetting. Twenty-\r\nfive years ago, the small island developing States cried \r\nout for action against human-induced climate change, \r\nwhile stressing that we literally faced extinction as \r\nnations and as oceanic cultures, owing to surging sea \r\nlevels and the related consequences. I must concede \r\nthat our voices have not been entirely unheard. We \r\nstand today, at last, many nations united to confront this \r\ndark, glaring reality. However, even in the relatively \r\nshort span of 25 years the relentless advance of climate \r\nchange has outpaced our efforts to deal with it — so \r\nthat today, while all countries must consider themselves \r\nvulnerable, the small island developing States are \r\ndealing with an already clear and present danger — the \r\nadverse impact of climate change.\r\nOver the years of my country’s membership in this \r\nunion of hope, we have observed what I would refer to as \r\nglacial progress, were it not for the fact that the glaciers \r\nthemselves are now melting. Nevertheless, we, along \r\nwith everyone in this Hall, must remain committed \r\nto the great mandates that we so boldly assigned \r\nourselves: the eradication of poverty, the advancement \r\nof international peace and security, universal adherence \r\nto human rights principles, the protection of our oceans \r\nand their resources, and better stewardship of our entire \r\nplanet.\r\nThe list goes on, and it is familiar to all of us. \r\nWe read it out each year at the general debate and in \r\nconference halls around the world. Yet, despite our \r\nproclamations and declarations, we seem to be pivoting \r\nnot too far from where we started. Our peoples look to \r\nus for progress beyond repetitive words.\r\nOn the issue of international refugees, Pacific \r\nIslanders live in a zone that emanates peace, and it \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n10/25 16-29453\r\npains us that the global menace of terrorism continues \r\nto spread worldwide. It seems that we are helpless to \r\nstop the tide of fear and violence — fear that affects \r\nmillions of innocent civilians, mothers and fathers, \r\nsons and daughters, to the point that they must suppress \r\ntheir human dignity and knock on a stranger’s door to \r\nseek shelter from the turmoil of war. The question is, \r\nwill we answer?\r\nAs small island countries in the Pacific and as \r\nmembers of this family of nations, we plead with the \r\nSecurity Council to take greater action and respond \r\nto that global crisis, if not for the mothers and fathers, \r\nthen at least for the children, whose innocence allows \r\nthem to play between tents and be happy at the sight of \r\nstrange food in a bowl.\r\nWe would like to know what is happening with the \r\nceasefire in Syria. Even from the Pacific, we have an \r\ninterest in that question. What are the United States and \r\nRussia doing about it? What is Syria doing about it? We \r\nknow they have the power to do more, and we ask them \r\nto please do so.\r\nOn the issue of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea, which is part of the Asia-Pacific region, the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia is concerned about the \r\npeace and long-term stability of the region. Together \r\nwith other nations, the Federated States of Micronesia \r\ncondemns the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s \r\nongoing provocative actions and rhetoric. Unchecked, \r\nthe Pacific Ocean, the same ocean that we speak of \r\nsaving for all our sakes, may become a battleground. \r\nOne truly wonders why Beijing and Moscow seem \r\nunconcerned that a missile could stray their way. I ask \r\nthem to please intercede on behalf of all of us. On that \r\nnote, the people of Micronesia look forward to the day \r\nwhen nuclear weapons will become a thing of the past, \r\nremembered only with great disdain and regret.\r\nOn the issue of Security Council reform, I have \r\nheard the phrase “fit for purpose” often used at the \r\nUnited Nations. We continue to see the need for a \r\nreformed United Nations that is not only fit for purpose, \r\nbut also dynamic, changing its modus operandi to keep \r\nin step with changing world circumstances, accepting \r\nnew methods like Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s \r\nexample of a smartphone on the first day of the general \r\ndebate (see A/71/PV.8), and needing to move in pace \r\nwith changes. The United Nations must be able to \r\nfocus on preventive diplomacy around the world and \r\nnot be limited to dealing with hot spots. I totally \r\nagree with that position. And yes, the United Nations \r\nmust be a catalyst for peace — a peacekeeper, more \r\nthan a peacemaker. The Security Council, entrusted \r\nwith the responsibility of maintaining international \r\npeace and security, must adapt to modern times and \r\nreflect contemporary geopolitical realities. However, \r\nas an arm of the United Nations, the Council can be \r\ncredible and effective only if properly empowered and \r\nadequately supported by Member States. In that regard, \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia reiterates its support \r\nfor the Group of Four countries being made permanent \r\nmembers of the Council.\r\nIt is interesting how we stand at this rostrum and \r\ntalk about disabilities. In that regard, I have noticed \r\nthat many of us leaders who come up here to speak also \r\nseem to have disabilities. We are colour-blind, unable \r\nto see the difference between green and red. I apologize \r\nfor that, and I will try to be brief.\r\nThe Group of Asia and the Pacific Small Island \r\nDeveloping States has long advocated for climate and \r\nsecurity to become a regular focus of the Security \r\nCouncil. The Group also submitted a proposal on the \r\nsubject to the World Humanitarian Summit, calling for \r\na special representative in the United Nations system \r\nto be dedicated to the issue of climate and security. \r\nMomentum appears to be on our side, and we hope that \r\nthe Secretary-General, while he is still with us, will \r\nappoint such a special representative, adding to his \r\nlegacy as a champion of climate change. \r\nThe selection of a new Secretary-General should \r\ninvolve the whole membership. That would help to \r\nensure that the new head of the Organization has the \r\npolitical support of all Members and is responsive, \r\nresponsible and effective on behalf of all, not just \r\nselect, elite, nations.\r\nOn sustainable development, the work of the United \r\nNations rests on three pillars: peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. This is the first year \r\nof implementation after the international community \r\nadopted a number of milestone agreements in 2015 — on \r\ndisaster-risk reduction, financing for development, the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nFrom the High-level Political Forum exercise held \r\nin July, we learned that integrating the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) into our national plans \r\nwill be daunting, and that a one-size-fits-all approach \r\nwill not work. Presenting a true picture of our national \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 11/25\r\ncircumstances should not be a burden on small island \r\ndeveloping States. In addition, the United Nations \r\nshould consider the statistics for countries with fewer \r\nthan 100,000 people, so as to ensure an inclusive process \r\nand so that truly no one is left behind. Many of the \r\nchallenges before the United Nations can be addressed \r\nonly through the collective work of its membership. \r\nSupport and partnerships are recognized as essential \r\nto making the SDGs universal and transformative for \r\nlives on the ground, and national ownership is critical.\r\nOn the issue of fisheries and oceans, while we may \r\nbe known as Pacific small island developing States here \r\nat the United Nations, there is another term that we \r\noften use, which is “big ocean States”. The Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia alone has 607 islands, spread \r\nacross 3 million square kilometres of the Pacific. \r\nWe are custodians of some of the world’s richest \r\nbiodiversity and marine resources, and have pledged \r\nto conserve 30 per cent of our near-shore marine areas \r\nunder the Micronesia Challenge, a regional effort to \r\npreserve the natural resources that are crucial to the \r\nsurvival of Pacific traditions, cultures and livelihoods. \r\nOur conservation efforts directly benefit my country’s \r\nsustainable use of its ocean fisheries.\r\nSpeaking of cultural preservation, I would like to \r\nthank UNESCO for its recent designation of our ancient \r\nruins of Nan Madol as a UNESCO World Heritage \r\nsite, a feat of construction that truly matches, if not \r\nsurpasses, the wonders of the Egyptian Pyramids. As \r\nfor climate change, the United Nations remains the last \r\nand best hope for galvanizing the necessary political \r\nwill and commitment for advancing our global agenda \r\non climate change. From this rostrum and elsewhere, \r\nleaders from small island developing States, like many \r\nothers, have called upon the States Members of our \r\nOrganization, especially world leaders, to step up and \r\ntake charge by calling for the urgently needed mitigation \r\nand financing initiatives to implement climate-change \r\nagreements.\r\nCurrent Government commitments fall considerably \r\nshort of even reaching the 2°C goal that we agreed to in \r\nParis. The recent ratification of the Paris Agreement by \r\nmore than 30 countries, including virtually all Pacific \r\nisland countries, raises our hopes and expectations that \r\nothers will soon follow suit.\r\nOn the issue of the Montreal Protocol on Substances \r\nthat Deplete the Ozone Layer, standing here one year \r\nago, I described the Federated States of Micronesia’s \r\nlong-standing efforts to amend the Protocol to phase \r\ndown hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) use, and I thanked new \r\nsupporters and noted that the proposals were finally \r\nbearing fruit (see A/70/PV.22). HFCs are the fastest-\r\ngrowing greenhouse gases in the world. They are also \r\nextremely potent, producing warming effects hundreds \r\nto thousands of times greater than those of carbon \r\ndioxide per ton. Phasing down HFCs will help prevent \r\nwarming emissions equivalent to almost 100 billion \r\ntons of carbon dioxide by 2050. Thanks to the many \r\ncountries that have supported the phase-out proposal, \r\nas set forth in the Montreal Protocol, that crusade has \r\ngained new momentum.\r\nLike others, I welcome the progress in the \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States and \r\nCuba. My country, too, has established diplomatic \r\nrelations with Cuba, but even if we had not entered \r\ninto that relationship for sovereign recognition and \r\npartnership, we, the Federated States of Micronesia, \r\na State Member of the United Nations, would still \r\nlend our strong support to resolution 70/120. We ask \r\nthe United States to accelerate its consideration of \r\nand process towards lifting the embargo imposed on \r\nCuba. Along the same lines, I applaud the peace accord \r\nreached among the people of Colombia. There may be \r\nsceptics as to the truce’s viability, but let us give peace \r\na chance by applauding the great effort and praying for \r\nits success. ¡Viva Colombia!\r\nEvery year, before coming to the General Assembly, \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum meets to review and \r\nrecommend our positions on issues worthy of bringing \r\nbefore the Assembly. Earlier this month, Heads of State \r\nand Government convened for the forty-seventh annual \r\nmeeting of the Forum in Micronesia. At that meeting, \r\nFrench Polynesia and New Caledonia were seated as full \r\nmembers of the Forum, while the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia became a member of the small island States. \r\nClimate change, oceans, health and human rights and \r\npartnership featured prominently on our agenda. On \r\nclimate change, the Forum reaffirmed its position that \r\nachieving the Paris Agreement’s goal of limiting the \r\naverage global temperature increase to 1.5°C degrees \r\nabove pre-industrial levels is an existential matter for \r\nmany Forum members, and that it must be addressed \r\nwith paramount urgency. The Forum also observed that \r\nthe Paris Agreement must be brought into force before \r\nthe end of 2016, or as soon as possible, even tomorrow.\r\nOn oceans, the Forum reaffirmed that the Pacific \r\nregion’s most important natural resource is our ocean. \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n12/25 16-29453\r\nTo that end, the Forum leaders endorsed the Pohnpei \r\nOceans Statement: A Course to Sustainability. In the \r\nStatement, the Forum reaffirmed that the ocean is the \r\nbasis for the livelihoods of Pacific peoples, and further \r\nnoted the valuable opportunity presented by the United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation \r\nof Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and \r\nsustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources \r\nfor sustainable development. The Statement further \r\nurges the timely and comprehensive conclusion of the \r\nPreparatory Committee process, established to make \r\nsubstantive recommendations to the General Assembly \r\non the elements of a draft text of an international, \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity in \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction.\r\nOn fisheries, the Forum called for action to \r\nend illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing and \r\nassociated activities, including high-seas bunkering, \r\nhuman trafficking, and illicit trade. The Forum further \r\nurged f lag States to exercise more diligent efforts \r\nin carrying out their f lag-State responsibilities and \r\nmaintaining control of their nationals.\r\nOur faith in the Organization rests not on the hope \r\nthat its goals can be reached within a certain time \r\nframe, whether it be 25 years or 71 years. Rather, it \r\nrests on our confidence that nothing is impossible \r\namong like-minded nations willing to unite in sustained \r\nefforts. In that regard, this Organization, the greatest \r\nconvocation ever devised by man, will continue to light \r\nour way and that of future generations.\r\nI will end my remarks with a quotation. Right after \r\nthe First World War, President Wilson wanted to see \r\nthe creation of an organization that would prevent all \r\nfuture wars. In that regard, he said, \r\n“A general association of nations must be formed \r\nunder specific covenants for the purpose of affording \r\nmutual guarantees of political independence and \r\nterritorial integrity to great and small States alike.” \r\nAn evident principle ran through the whole programme, \r\nnamely, the principle of justice for all peoples and \r\nnationalities and their right to live on equal terms of \r\nliberty and safety with one another — whether they be \r\nstrong or weak. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Peter M. Christian, President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the \r\nRepublic of Latvia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nLatvia.\r\nMr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Raimonds Vējonis, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Latvia, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vējonis: This year marks the twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of Latvia’s independence and \r\nmembership in the United Nations. My country took \r\nits rightful place at the United Nations in 1991, with \r\nthe clear objective of making a contribution to the \r\ncollective security, stability and prosperity of the world. \r\nAs a responsible democratic State based on the rule of \r\nlaw and respect for human dignity and freedom, Latvia \r\nremains strongly committed to the essential work of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe United Nations has been, and will be, our \r\nplatform for global engagement. The far-reaching \r\nagreements on sustainable development and climate \r\nchange have restored trust in the multilateral system’s \r\nability to deliver solutions on pressing global issues. \r\nMore than ever, the world has great expectations that \r\nthe United Nations will meet the rising challenges \r\nfor peace and development and deliver effective and \r\nprompt results. \r\nLast year, in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, we all pledged to leave no one behind. \r\nThis promise supports poverty eradication and \r\ndevelopment efforts in the most challenging contexts. \r\nIt means addressing persistent vulnerabilities and \r\nbuilding resilience in complex, protracted crises and \r\nconflict-affected populations. Therefore, strengthening \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 13/25\r\nthe development and security nexus must become our \r\nmission. \r\nAll people have the right to live in peace and security \r\nin their own countries. Conflicts, poverty, disasters \r\nand climate change have contributed to the rise of large \r\nmovements of refugees and migrants. Some 125 million \r\npeople around the world are in desperate need of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. The current unprecedented \r\nmigration crisis cannot be addressed by the most \r\naffected countries alone; it is a global phenomenon that \r\nrequires joint efforts and shared responsibility. The \r\nglobal commitment to shared responsibility shown at \r\nthe United Nations summit held on Monday goes hand \r\nin hand with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. Sustainable solutions \r\nmust be found to ensure opportunities for education, \r\nemployment and business for persons forcibly displaced \r\nduring protracted crises and conflicts and to provide \r\nsupport for host communities and countries. \r\nThe development of peaceful and inclusive \r\nsocieties, good governance and respect for human \r\nrights will also help us to tackle the spread of violent \r\nextremism, while military and security measures are \r\nnecessary to combat Da’esh and similar groups. We \r\nneed to address the root causes of people’s willingness \r\nto choose violent extremism. \r\nLatvia is part of the global coalition against Da’esh \r\nthat has been instrumental in combating the group in \r\nIraq and Syria. We welcome the NATO decision to \r\nstep up support for the efforts of the coalition to that \r\nend. Only unified, coordinated, collective action at the \r\nglobal, regional and national levels will help us succeed \r\nin confronting the new, unconventional threats. \r\nTerrorist attacks continue almost daily. Fighting \r\nterrorism must remain our priority. The international \r\ncommunity needs a plan for building resilience in \r\nthe communities that for years have suffered under \r\nthe barbaric rule of Da’esh. The willingness of local \r\npopulations will also be required if their future is \r\nto be shaped by the primacy of the rule of law and \r\nhuman rights, thus countering the factors conducive to \r\nradicalization, extremism and terrorism.\r\nWe will not be able to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals without sustaining peace and \r\npreventing conflict. The need for decisive political \r\naction to address and prevent the conflict that causes \r\nmassive displacement and suffering is more urgent than \r\never. The international community must find political \r\nsolutions. \r\nThe security challenges in the Middle East are \r\nmarked by a high degree of complexity, spillover and \r\nrefugee f lows. After five years of civil war, Syria has \r\nbeen destroyed. Attacks against civilians, medical \r\nfacilities and schools continue. This is unacceptable. \r\nThe perpetrators of international crimes must be \r\nbrought to justice. A real nationwide ceasefire and \r\nimproved humanitarian access are the prerequisite \r\nfor the resumption of talks. Latvia has provided its \r\ncontribution to mitigating the consequences of the \r\nconflict. However, only credible and inclusive political \r\nsolutions will return Syria to stability. All members of \r\nthe International Syria Support Group must put their \r\npolitical weight behind the United Nations-led process.\r\nIn Libya, the institutional vacuum has created a \r\nbreeding ground for terrorist groups such as Da’esh. \r\nThe unification and cohesion of rival parties in Libya is \r\na key element for the country’s long-term stability and \r\nits success in the fight against terrorists. \r\nIran’s diligent implementation of the Joint \r\nComprehensive Plan of Action and its cooperation \r\nwith the International Atomic Energy Agency will \r\ncontribute to greater stability in the Middle East. In \r\ncontrast, North Korea’s irresponsible actions, including \r\nits repeated nuclear tests, undermine the security of all \r\ncountries in the region and beyond. \r\nWe support all recent international efforts aimed at \r\nmaking progress towards the resumption of the Middle \r\nEast peace process and find common ground that will \r\nbring the two parties back to meaningful dialogue. \r\nThere is no alternative to a two-State solution reached \r\nthrough peace negotiations. \r\nEnsuring long-term stability in Afghanistan is \r\nof vital importance for global and regional security. \r\nAdverse developments in that country can have \r\nspillover effects on the neighbouring countries of \r\nCentral Asia, which undermines their potential to \r\ndevelop economic connectivity at the macroregional \r\nlevel. Latvia provides Afghanistan with political and \r\nfinancial support for reform in the country. We call \r\non more active regional cooperation, together with \r\ncontinued international support, to sustain the growth \r\nand prosperity of Afghanistan and its people.\r\nIn many other countries, the political situation \r\nis highly volatile, and some are engulfed in conflict. \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n14/25 16-29453\r\nThe United Nations and its peace efforts can help to \r\nstabilize these countries and gradually bring them back \r\nto normalcy.\r\nWe support the United Nations in its aim to \r\nmake peacekeeping more effective through updating \r\navailable tools for meeting new challenges. Better \r\nplanning, equipment and training will improve the \r\neffectiveness of peacekeeping and the protection of \r\ncivilians. There should be greater focus on strengthened \r\ncollaboration with regional organizations. Building \r\nupon experience from other international operations, \r\nLatvia is now involved for the first time in a United \r\nNations peacekeeping operation, in Mali.\r\nThis is still a very turbulent time for European \r\nsecurity. For Latvia, the stability and security of \r\nEurope’s neighbours in the East is a strategic priority \r\nand remains high on our political agenda. The resolution \r\nof protracted conflicts in Transnistria, Abkhazia, South \r\nOssetia and Nagorno Karabakh should have priority \r\non the international agenda. We must remain vigilant \r\nand insist that all States, including Russia, abide by \r\ntheir obligations under international law with regard to \r\nrespecting the borders of sovereign States.\r\nTogether with the international community, Latvia \r\nwill continue to stand for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of Ukraine. We refuse to recognize the illegal \r\nannexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation; it must \r\nend. Any discrimination against the Crimean Tatars and \r\nethnic Ukrainians in Crimea requires a firm reaction \r\nfrom the United Nations. The international community \r\nmust work to facilitate the peaceful resolution of the \r\nconflict in eastern Ukraine. All parties must fulfil their \r\ncommitments under the Minsk agreements and make \r\nthe Minsk process work. Latvia continues to support \r\nUkraine in its reforms and with its humanitarian needs. \r\nThe United Nations capacity to address current \r\nchallenges also depends on the political will to make \r\nprogress on the necessary reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, which is long overdue. We should all be \r\naiming to strengthen the legitimacy of this important \r\nbody. Accordingly, the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council should refrain from using their veto \r\npower in situations involving atrocity crimes. Latvia \r\nsupports not only this important initiative, but also the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency group’s \r\ncode of conduct on Security Council action against \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes.\r\nWe are determined to maintain the political \r\nmomentum for climate action. In April of this year, \r\nLatvia signed the historic Paris Agreement. We will \r\nstrive to ratify the Agreement as soon as possible and \r\nencourage others to do the same. Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon has been driving the push for worldwide \r\naction on climate change and gender equality. Latvia is \r\ngrateful to him for his leadership and dedication over \r\nthe past decade.\r\nThe scope of challenges that the world faces is \r\ndaunting. The bold global agenda requires leadership. \r\nThe expectations placed on the next Secretary-General \r\nof the United Nations are therefore as high as ever. \r\nThis important job requires courage and readiness to \r\neffectively tackle the issues that we face. While we \r\nare looking for the best-qualified candidate, we also \r\nrecall that Eastern Europe is the only region that has \r\nnever held the post of Secretary-General. I am equally \r\nconvinced that after 70 years, it is time to choose a \r\nwoman for the Organization’s top job.\r\nMs. Young (Belize), Vice-President, took the Chair. \r\nThere are many challenges that shape the evolving \r\nglobal landscape, but we now see the clear outlines of \r\nthe new and better world that can be reached through \r\ndiligent implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. Implementation of the new \r\nAgenda will not be easy. Only through an informed and \r\nactive society, in true partnership with all stakeholders, \r\nand through review of the progress made, will we be \r\nable to achieve the necessary transformative change by \r\n2030. This is the time for us to act together responsibly. \r\nLatvia will continue to play its part in shaping a better \r\nfuture for us all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Raimonds Vējonis, President of the Republic \r\nof Latvia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall. \r\nAdress by Mr. Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Chairman of the Presidency of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 15/25\r\nMr. Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Excellency Mr. Bakir Izetbegović, \r\nChairman of the Presidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Izetbegović: Peace and security, human \r\nrights and development are the pillars of the United \r\nNations — a founding promise to the world that this \r\nOrganization was created to safeguard. Yet our world \r\ntoday is anything but peaceful and secure; it is marred \r\nby injustice, inequality and intolerance, each of which \r\nerodes the foundations of human society. We are \r\nwitnessing human suffering on an unprecedented scale, \r\nsuffering that reaches far beyond national boundaries \r\nand capacities to deal with it. Poverty, hunger, disease, \r\nnatural disasters and climate change aff lict millions of \r\nour fellow human beings. Many States and societies are \r\ntrapped in protracted conflicts, with cycles of violence \r\nclaiming countless victims.\r\nWe are facing the worst forced displacement crisis \r\nsince the Second World War. Some 60 million people \r\nhave been forced to f lee their homes because of wars, \r\npersecution and human-rights violations. They are \r\nscattered around the world with their livelihoods and \r\ncommunities shattered to pieces and their nations and \r\ncultures torn apart. Robbed of their dignity and living \r\nin despair in refugee camps, they are compelled to seek \r\na better future on the borders of other countries. They \r\nare not faceless statistics, but human beings with every \r\nright to a future free of violence and a future full of \r\nhope and opportunity. Their tragedy is our tragedy; \r\ntheir future is our future.\r\nThis crisis requires not only a humanitarian \r\nresponse but a sustainable political solution. It requires \r\nstronger political leadership and resolve, as well as \r\na rethinking of policy, operational and financing \r\nstrategies at national, regional and international levels. \r\nHowever, all too often, narrow national interests impede \r\nthe formulation of such joint responses. When crises, \r\nsuch as the current refugee and migrant crisis in the \r\nMiddle East and in Europe, transcend borders we must \r\nlook at the big picture — not merely from the standpoint \r\nof national interests — because the consequences of \r\nour actions and omissions resonate beyond our borders.\r\nAs a country that had hundreds of thousands of \r\nits citizens suffer the plight of being forced out of \r\ntheir homes, Bosnia and Herzegovina attaches great \r\nsignificance to addressing this challenge. We recognize \r\nthe importance and timely organization of the summit \r\nfor refugees and migrants, and we welcome the \r\nadoption of the outcome document (resolution 71/1) that \r\nis clearly linked to the 2030 Agenda. We hope that the \r\ncommitments made by Member States at that meeting \r\nwill have meaningful impact on the ground. In the 2030 \r\nAgenda, we pledged to ensure that no one is left behind \r\nand committed to empowering the most vulnerable. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina fully supports the 2030 \r\nAgenda. As a newly elected member of the Economic \r\nand Social Council, we will play an active role in \r\nthe implementation of this transformative blueprint \r\nfor change. Our ability to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) will depend on the availability \r\nof support for national implementation — primarily \r\nfrom the revised and improved Global Partnership \r\nfor Sustainable Development, which must be a true \r\nglobal platform for the exchange of best practices in \r\nthe fields of finance, trade, technology and capacity-\r\nbuilding among Member States. We support the Global \r\nMechanism and the monitoring of the implementation of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, which will outline \r\ncritical milestones towards a coherent and inclusive \r\nfollow-up and review of the Agenda at the global level.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda requires us to achieve \r\ntransformation not only for the sake of the people \r\nbut also for the sake of the planet. Our development \r\nmust not come at the expense of our habitat. Unless \r\nwe urgently take coordinated global action to reverse \r\nexisting patterns of environmental degradation and \r\nclimate change, we risk endangering a desired future \r\nfor generations to come. Fulfilling the commitments \r\nof the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \r\n2015-2030 and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nis critical to protecting development outcomes and \r\nadapting to the consequences of natural disasters and \r\nclimate change through risk-informed development. \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is already implementing \r\nits Climate Change Adaptation and Low-Emission \r\nDevelopment Strategy, with the aim of becoming a \r\nviable and advanced green economy by 2025.\r\nBut we need to stay alert. The 2030 Agenda is not \r\nthe answer to all our problems. There is always room \r\nfor inequality and injustice to thrive if our approach, \r\nacceptance and implementation are not cohesive and \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n16/25 16-29453\r\nunified. What we make of the 2030 Agenda and how \r\nwe build upon it will determine its results in improving \r\nequal opportunity for all people.\r\nHuman rights are at the heart of the 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, from eradicating poverty to \r\nreducing inequality and promoting inclusive societies. \r\nAs we start to bring people in from the margins, we \r\nmust strive to put human rights at the centre of our \r\nactions, as they are the most powerful driving forces of \r\npeace and development. The SDGs are the gold standard \r\nwe are committed to upholding so that our people can \r\nenjoy dignity, freedom and equality. They are a moral \r\nand legal framework that empowers people everywhere \r\nto fight injustice anywhere.\r\nWe are deeply concerned about the erosion of \r\nworld peace and security caused by new and protracted \r\nconflicts, especially in the Middle East. The Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict, which has lasted for over 60 years, \r\nhas been the primary and constant source of instability \r\nin the Middle East. A new impetus for negotiations is \r\nurgently needed. We strongly support efforts to hold \r\na peace conference that would bring a lasting and just \r\nresolution to this conflict, based on the principles of \r\ninternational law and reaching a consensus on the \r\npeaceful coexistence of two independent States.\r\nInternational peace and stability are being \r\ndramatically undermined by the violence and crimes \r\nagainst the Syrian people. It is deeply troubling that \r\nthe most influential global and regional actors have \r\nso far failed to find a peaceful solution to the crisis \r\nin Syria. Bosnia and Herzegovina fully supports the \r\nGeneva peace talks and the efforts of the International \r\nSyria Support Group to find a political solution to \r\nthis conflict. The peaceful future of Syria rests upon \r\nrespecting the will of the Syrian people and allowing \r\nthem to express that will in democratic elections.\r\nThe so-called Islamic State in Iraq and the \r\nLevant (ISIL) has severely destabilized Syria, Iraq \r\nand the broader Middle East, posing a grave threat \r\nto international security. Its ideology, objectives and \r\nactions are contrary to all values and norms of our \r\ncivilization. We condemn in the strongest possible \r\nterms the atrocities, systematic abuses of human rights \r\nand violations of international law committed by ISIL. \r\nAs a member of the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina will continue to contribute \r\nwithin our means to international efforts to defeat this \r\nterrorist organization.\r\nTerrorism is a global threat that affects us all. No \r\nState or society is immune to it, and no State alone \r\ncan counter it. With violent extremism on the rise \r\nand a growing number of foreign fighters, terrorism \r\nis becoming an increasingly difficult challenge that \r\nrequires a comprehensive response involving the \r\ncollaboration of all States, employing both preventative \r\nand security measures. We face a problem that has deep \r\nand complex roots, that transcends national boundaries, \r\nand that cannot, and should not, be associated with \r\nany one religion, nationality or ethnic group. Those \r\nwho perpetrate, organize and inspire terrorist attacks, \r\nclaiming to do so in the name of Islam, want to turn \r\nIslam into an ideology of global fear. Violent extremism \r\nand terrorism are unacceptable from the viewpoint of \r\nany religion, including Islam. They undermine Islam’s \r\nsystem of values and its universal teachings of tolerance \r\nand coexistence.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is strongly committed to \r\ncombating terrorism in all its forms. We are deeply \r\nconcerned with the rise of violent extremism, and attach \r\na great importance to countering it. We welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s Plan of Action to Prevent Violent \r\nExtremism as another useful tool in a comprehensive \r\nwhole-of-United Nations approach to preventing \r\nviolent extremism. The prevention of extremism and \r\nthe promotion of human rights are inextricably linked. \r\nInclusive governance and respect for the rule of law \r\nare of paramount importance. Political, economic and \r\nsocial injustices around the world contribute to the rise \r\nof despair and hopelessness, creating a fertile ground \r\nfor the emergence of radicalism and violent extremism.\r\nIn the imperfect world in which we live, injustice \r\nis constantly growing, but actions that cause further \r\ninjustice are not the right response. Our Governments \r\nmust and will respond to violence with forceful and \r\nrepressive measures. However, if that part of our \r\nresponse is not carried out precisely and selectively, \r\nwith respect for human rights and the rule of law, it will \r\nonly cause a new wave of radicalization. The real fight \r\nand ultimate victory must and can be reached solely on \r\nthe ideological level.\r\nOur approach and strategy must be holistic. We \r\nmust apply a wide range of policies and measures \r\nthat address the economic and social conditions \r\nconducive to the spread of violent extremism that \r\nterrorist organizations exploit to drive recruitment and \r\nradicalization. In particular, we must work harder to \r\neliminate discrimination, prejudice and xenophobia in \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 17/25\r\nour societies, reduce poverty and inequality, improve \r\neducation and expand opportunities, especially for our \r\nyounger generations.\r\nThe engagement of the United Nations has never \r\nbeen more critical, as we face unprecedented challenges \r\nin confronting the surge in violence in various forms \r\naround the world. Global action, guided by the \r\nprinciples of international law, is required to put an end \r\nto the violence and instability in Ukraine, Syria, Iraq, \r\nLibya and other crisis areas. Ensuring the protection \r\nof civilians and compliance with international \r\nhumanitarian and human rights law is imperative. \r\nNeutrality and indifference lead to resentment and \r\nfrustration, further emboldening those who leave \r\ndevastation and sorrow in their wake.\r\nHumanitarian aid can never serve as a substitute \r\nfor solutions that address the root causes of conflict, \r\nnor can it create the necessary conditions for lasting \r\npeace and stability. The main causes of modern \r\nconflicts are discrimination and exclusion, failures of \r\ngovernance, impunity, deep-rooted poverty and the \r\nlack of opportunity, aggravated by the growing effects \r\nof climate change. In our increasingly interconnected \r\nworld, we can no longer keep the impact of faraway \r\nconflicts outside our borders, nor can we ignore their \r\nglobal consequences. Our past failures, which came at \r\na very high human cost, should have taught us how to \r\nbetter prevent and end conflicts. The scenes from Syria \r\nor the Mediterranean shores are a painful reminder that \r\nwe have not learned those lessons and are still failing to \r\nturn our promises into actions.\r\nWe must act upon early-warning signs of potential \r\nconflict. It is critically important to develop and \r\nstrengthen shared frameworks for conflict-risk \r\nanalysis, including early-warning mechanisms at the \r\nlocal, national, regional and international levels. Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina encourages the better use of Articles \r\n34 and 99 of the Charter of the United Nations by the \r\nSecurity Council in order to place greater emphasis \r\non preventive diplomacy in situations that could give \r\nrise to conflict or threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity. Early United Nations engagement and use of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s good offices, combined with \r\nregional mediation efforts, can also substantially reduce \r\nthe risk of conflict. We support the United Nations in \r\nconvening an international conflict-prevention forum \r\nby 2020, and we urge the Secretary-General to develop \r\na comprehensive United Nations plan to strengthen \r\nconflict prevention.\r\nWe recognize the value of introducing United \r\nNations peacebuilding efforts at an early stage, \r\nalongside peacekeeping activities. The contemporary \r\npeace and security environment demands increasingly \r\ncomplex peacekeeping missions with coherent mandates \r\nthat effectively correspond to situations on the ground. \r\nWe are proud to have contributed to the United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations in the Congo and in Mali with \r\nour military peacekeepers and with police officers in \r\nSouth Sudan, Liberia, Cyprus and Afghanistan, nearly \r\na quarter of whom were women.\r\nBosnia and Herzegovina is deeply committed to \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nmultilateralism and the settling of international \r\ndisputes and conflicts through peaceful means. Using \r\nthe advantages of our geopolitical position as a bridge \r\nbetween the East and the West and a meeting point \r\nof civilizations, we want to advance dialogue and \r\nunderstanding and forge partnerships with friendly \r\ncountries around the world. We strongly value and are \r\ncommitted to regional and subregional cooperation \r\nand remain active in a number of regional initiatives \r\nfocusing on peacebuilding, migration, cross-border \r\nsecurity and development issues.\r\nAt home and abroad, we will continue to uphold \r\nand promote good governance, democracy, human \r\nrights and the rule of law. We will continue advocating \r\nthe use of all available legal mechanisms to seek \r\nand achieve justice for all victims of crimes against \r\nhumanity, because we believe that truth and justice are \r\nprerequisites for achieving lasting reconciliation, peace \r\nand security.\r\nIn the past year we have seen a renewed sense of \r\nunity and unprecedented levels of commitment. We \r\nacceded to the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction 2015-2030, the Addis Ababa Action Plan \r\non Transformative Financing for Gender Equality \r\nand Women’s Empowerment, the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, the Agenda for Humanity \r\nand the historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nWe have collectively committed ourselves to the \r\nbetterment of humankind with our renewed focus on \r\nconflict prevention and resolution and our strengthened \r\nefforts towards sustainable development, equal \r\nopportunity for all, the promotion of gender equality \r\nand the empowerment of women and girls.\r\nPeace and security cannot be detached from either \r\ndevelopment or environmental agendas. Peace is not \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n18/25 16-29453\r\nmerely the absence of violence. It is freedom from \r\nfear and insecurity. There can be no lasting peace and \r\nsecurity when injustice and inequality are an everyday \r\nexperience for millions of people or when basic rights \r\nand freedoms are denied to so many human beings. \r\nThe resulting grievances make our States unstable and \r\nour societies vulnerable and readily fuel extremism, \r\nradicalization and violence. Injustice and inequality \r\ndiminish the human potential of our communities, \r\nleaving development and prosperity beyond their reach.\r\nThe road towards progress goes from ending \r\npoverty to reducing inequality and building just, \r\nequitable, tolerant, open and inclusive societies, with \r\nrespect for human rights and the promotion of the rule \r\nof law at the core of our every action. History will judge \r\nus by the difference we make in the lives of millions \r\nof people who are suffering from marginalization, \r\ndiscrimination, poverty, malnutrition, disease, natural \r\ndisasters and climate change. We must listen to their \r\nvoices and respond to their needs, hopes and aspirations. \r\nWe must find the will and courage to take urgent actions \r\nto turn the agendas we agreed upon into instruments of \r\ntrue global change, honouring our pledge to humankind \r\nand leaving a legacy true to our values.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Chairman of the \r\nPresidency of Bosnia and Herzegovina for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Bakir Izetbegović, Chairman of the Presidency \r\nof Bosnia and Herzegovina, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. José Mário Vaz, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau.\r\nMr. José Mário Vaz, President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. José Mário Vaz, President \r\nof the Republic of Guinea-Bissau, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vaz (spoke in Portuguese; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): It is a great honour and \r\nprivilege for me to be addressing the Assembly for the \r\nfirst time since I took office as President of the Republic \r\nof Guinea-Bissau.\r\nFirst allow me to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at this session, and to \r\nwish him the greatest success in his work. I also thank \r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, \r\nfor his excellent work during the previous session. I \r\nwould also like express our appreciation for the theme \r\nchosen for this session, under President Thomson’s \r\nimportant sponsorship, which focuses on the issue of \r\nsustainable development.\r\nGuinea-Bissau believes that this session is an \r\nopportunity to strengthen the commitments made \r\nas well as the division of responsibilities among all \r\ninternational actors in pursuit of the Goals of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1).\r\nThe Addis Ababa Action Agenda (resolution \r\n69/313) for development financing, approved by the \r\nGeneral Assembly in July 2015, gave rise to fresh \r\nhope with regard to financing for the achievement of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. The commitments \r\nmade by the parties must be respected. The goals of the \r\n2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda are \r\ncomplementary and must be harmonized and aligned.\r\nMy country is strongly committed to doing our part \r\nin implementing the commitments made in the context \r\nof global and regional strategies. Thus we are proud of \r\nthe fact that our national development plan is in line \r\nwith many of the Goals of the Agenda and also of the \r\npolitical will demonstrated by the national authorities \r\nto gradually adjust this strategic plan in order to fully \r\naccommodate the 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nGuinea-Bissau has very important natural capital to \r\nleverage for our development and for the preservation \r\nof the environment in the West Africa ecoregion. Thus \r\nbiodiversity has become an axis that cuts across all \r\nother aspects of my country’s development.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to briefly share \r\nwith the Assembly the current political situation \r\nand the efforts that have been made to overcome \r\nthe institutional challenges that our country faces, \r\nparticularly our political authorities.\r\nJust before I left to attend this session, thanks to \r\nthe mediation of the Heads of State of Guinea Conakry \r\nand Sierra Leone, who were in my country recently, in \r\naccordance with a decision reached at the Conference \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 19/25\r\nof Heads of State and Government of the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS), held \r\nin Dakar, an agreement was signed with a view to \r\novercoming the current roadblocks in our Parliament. \r\nThe agreement was signed by the President of the \r\nNational Popular Assembly, the Prime Minister and the \r\ntwo main political parties.\r\nThe understanding reached deserves the full \r\nsupport of the President of the Republic, ECOWAS and \r\nother partners of Guinea-Bissau as an important step \r\ntoward the easing of political tensions and a consensus \r\nplatform that will allow us to ensure Government \r\nstability until the end of the legislative term.\r\nThe endorsement of this understanding by the \r\nHeads of State of ECOWAS and the international \r\ncommunity, which met yesterday to discuss the way \r\nforward to implementing the agreement, rauses the hope \r\nthat all parties are strongly committed to establishing \r\npeace and stability so as to allow the agreement to \r\nbe implemented.\r\nTherefore, allow me to reiterate my commitment \r\nto do all that is required, through a frank and open \r\ndialogue with all active forces in our country, in order \r\nto consolidate an environment of peace and social \r\nstability, which are indispensable to a process of stable \r\ngovernance in our country.\r\nI should note, however, that today the Bissau-\r\nGuinean crisis is no longer a political and military crisis, \r\nbut merely, and eminently, a political and institutional \r\ncrisis. I should also note that, from the outset of my \r\nterm, not a single shot has been fired by military or \r\nparamilitary personnel; no one has been killed or beaten \r\nfor political reasons; there have been no reported cases \r\nof arbitrary arrest; there is freedom of expression, the \r\npress and demonstration; and no issues of human rights \r\nviolations have been raised.\r\nAs Supreme Commander of the armed forces, I \r\nwould also like to reiterate to the Assembly our request \r\nfor United Nations support for the process of national \r\nreconciliation that is under way in our country; for \r\nthe participation of our armed forces in international \r\npeacekeeping missions; for the implementation of safety \r\nand security-sector reform, which is of great importance, \r\nnamely with respect to the control of weapons and the \r\nmanagement of materiel; the construction of armories \r\nand the renovation of barracks; and the securing of \r\nfunds for the reintegration of demobilized troops.\r\nThe world today faces a tremendous challenge: \r\ncombating and overcoming the scourges of terrorism, \r\ndrug trafficking, climate change and other evils that \r\nare ravaging our countries. These threats are clear \r\nevidence of the security challenges that we face on our \r\nshared planet.\r\nOur subregion, West Africa, is also affected \r\nby acts of terrorism, which represent an intolerable \r\nmanifestation of barbarism and of disdain for the \r\nmost sacred values of humanity. I wish to take this \r\nunique opportunity to once again express my country’s \r\nsolidarity with the countries and peoples that are victims \r\nof terrorism and reiterate our commitment to them.\r\nGuinea-Bissau welcomes the signing of the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change and calls for its \r\nimplementation as a key tool for regulating international \r\ndialogue and cooperation among States, which hold in \r\ntheir hands the fate of the planet.\r\nClimate change poses an emerging risk for Guinea-\r\nBissau. We are a coastal country, with an island \r\nportion and a high risk of sea-level rise, which poses \r\na great threat to a significant portion of our territory. \r\nTherefore, climate change matters are some of the main \r\npriorities of our political action. Accordingly, we have \r\ngreat interest in participating in and closely monitoring \r\nthe High-level United Nations Conference to Support \r\nthe Implementation of Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 14 — on conserving and sustainably using the \r\noceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable \r\ndevelopment — which will take place in New York in \r\n2017. The President of the General Assembly is therefore \r\nin the right place to fulfil the mission the Assembly has \r\nassigned to him in this regard. \r\nIn the past year, we have observed an important \r\ndevelopment in the international context, namely, \r\nthe rapprochement between the United States and \r\nCuba, which we greatly welcomed. We hope that the \r\nnormalization of bilateral relations may bring these two \r\nfriends of Guinea-Bissau closer together. In addition, \r\nwe call for the implementation of the resolutions calling \r\nfor a two-State solution, with Israel and Palestine living \r\nside by side in peace and security.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to publicly \r\nacknowledge Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the \r\nSecurity Council and the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nfor their continued focus on, solidarity with, and \r\nongoing monitoring of Guinea-Bissau, its people and \r\nits authorities, even in an environment of multiple and \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n20/25 16-29453\r\ncomplex challenges. In addition, on behalf of the people \r\nof Guinea-Bissau, I would also like to recognize and \r\nthank the Economic Community of West African States \r\n(ECOWAS), its Commission and its member States \r\nfor their political, financial and military support in \r\nthe process of stabilizing, securing and reforming the \r\nsafety and security sectors.\r\nI would like to offer a word of appreciation to \r\nMrs. Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, Chair of the ECOWAS \r\nAuthority of Heads of State and Government, and special \r\nthanks to President Alpha Condé of Guinea for his role \r\nin facilitating the dialogue in the political process in \r\nGuinea-Bissau. We also offer our profound gratitude \r\nto Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of Nigeria, for \r\nhis unwavering support as head of the International \r\nContact Group on Guinea-Bissau. I further convey our \r\ngratitude to all heads of State in the subregion, who \r\nhave given a high level of attention to Guinea-Bissau \r\nduring the years our political crisis persisted.\r\nOur recognition of and gratitude to all other \r\ninternational partners, countries and organizations, \r\nnamely, the African Union, the West African \r\nEconomic and Monetary Union, the European Union, \r\nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, \r\nthe World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, \r\nthe African Development Bank, the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, UNICEF, the World \r\nHealth Organization, the World Food Programme, \r\nthe Food and Agriculture Organization of the United \r\nNations, the United Nations Population Fund and the \r\nInternational Organization of la Francophonie, which \r\nhave always stood with Guinea-Bissau and supported \r\nour country in its pursuit of paths leading to stability \r\nand development. The support of our international \r\npartners, as seen in the results of the Brussels round \r\ntable in 2015, unequivocally translates into attention \r\nto the situation of the State and the people of Guinea-\r\nBissau. As promised, we count on our partners’ help to \r\nleverage economic development as the engine for peace \r\nand stability in our country.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our \r\nappreciation for the United Nations and the United \r\nNations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Guinea-\r\nBissau, which kept their attention on and unflaggingly \r\nmonitored Guinea-Bissau, our people and our \r\ninstitutions despite the multiple and complex problems \r\nthat the world is facing. It is with great satisfaction that \r\nI highlight the indispensable role of the United Nations, \r\nthrough its representative in Guinea-Bissau, Mr. Modibo \r\nTouré, whom I thank for his personal dedication to \r\nfacilitating dialogue and seeking solutions, as well as \r\nthe strengthened consolidation of the democratic rule \r\nof law in Guinea-Bissau.\r\nFinally, I wish the President of the Assembly \r\ncontinued success as he conducts the work of this \r\nseventy-first session of the General Assembly on behalf \r\nof the States and peoples of the world. May God bless \r\nus all.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Guinea-Bissau for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. José Mário Vaz, President of the Republic of \r\nGuinea-Bissau, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Miloš Zeman, President of the \r\nCzech Republic \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Czech Republic.\r\nMr. Miloš Zeman, President of the Czech Republic, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Miloš Zeman, President of \r\nthe Czech Republic, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nPresident Zeman: One year ago, here in this Hall, \r\nI warned the international community of the threat \r\nposed by the spread of international terrorism (see \r\nA/70/PV.17). What has happened in the year since then? \r\nParis, Brussels, Dhaka, Istanbul, Orlando, Munich, \r\nNice and New York, again, is what happened. \r\nA few years ago, the number of countries that were \r\ninfluenced by Islamic terrorism was only six. Now, it \r\nis 35. The Islamic State is something like a cancer. But \r\nit is not only a tumor. Many cancers have metastases, \r\nwhich are more dangerous than the original tumor \r\nitself, and this is what we are observing in the spread of \r\nradicalism, terrorism and fanaticism. We must now ask, \r\nhow long are we to wait before we act? How long are we \r\ngoing to be limited to conveying only condolences? How \r\nlong will we be constrained to make only declarations \r\nof solidarity? \r\nI admit that there are some limited actions can \r\nbe taken against terrorism, but they are, in fact, very \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 21/25\r\nlimited, while terrorism is spreading all the time. There \r\nare three main risks in this area. The first is that, in \r\nthe near future, there will be a new Islamic State in \r\nAfghanistan. If there is a reduction of NATO forces \r\nin Afghanistan, a victory by the Taliban is highly \r\nprobable. If that were to happen, we can expect to see \r\nthe same level of cruelty from the Taliban as that which \r\nwe have seen from Al-Qaida, the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Levant, Boko Haram and the Al-Nusra Front \r\nand others.\r\nThe second risk is the extremization or radicalization \r\nof the population, which is still quite unstable. Let me \r\ncite one unpleasant example. In the 1930s, in Germany, \r\nthe population was also quite unstable despite the fact \r\nthat it was a very cultivated population. After all, \r\nGermany is the nation of Goethe and Schiller. Over the \r\ncourse of a few years, this very decent nation became \r\none of fanatical Nazis. It only took a few years. We \r\nmust admit that such radicalization or extremization is \r\nalso possible today.\r\nThe third risk stems from our hesitation and our \r\nlack of courage in carrying out decisive actions. My \r\ncountry, though small, has troops in Afghanistan, \r\nMali and other parts of the world. That, however, is \r\nnot enough. What we need is the coordinated action of \r\nmost if not all States Members of the United Nations. \r\nBut what can be done until that happens? Let me cite \r\nanother example. \r\nWhat we need is a solid, firm, comprehensive \r\nUnited Nations platform on international terrorism. A \r\nproposal for such a platform was put forward by India \r\nin the year 2000 — 16 years ago. Sixteen years later, we \r\nare still discussing how international terrorism should \r\nbe defined. International lawyers have literally been \r\ndiscussing this issue for 16 years. \r\nThank God I am not an international lawyer. I \r\nsay that because, for me, a terrorist is anybody who \r\nintentionally kills innocent civilian people. It is that \r\nsimple: “Elementary, my dear Watson”, as they say. \r\nUnfortunately, the United Nations has been discussing \r\na programme — and the definition of international \r\nterrorism — for 16 years. As a result, I have some doubts \r\nabout the efficiency of this international Organization. \r\nI hope the Acting President will excuse me for being so \r\nblunt. Obviously, this state of affairs is not satisfactory; \r\nwe do not have the platform we need. \r\nLast year, I proposed the creation of an international \r\nforce, equipped with drones, helicopters and air rangers \r\nand using improved communication among national \r\nsecret services. I was very happy to learn that the \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, \r\nour French colleague, proposed the same thing: using \r\nthe experience with drones and helicopters in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo to wage the fight \r\nagainst jihadists. What we need is not massive territorial \r\noperations — those have led to bad experiences in Iraq, \r\nSyria and Libya, where we were able to destroy, but \r\nwe were not able to build; rather, we must attack the \r\nmost sensitive points, the nerve centres of international \r\nterrorism, without occupying territory. We must attack \r\nthe brain, not the body.\r\nI had hoped that there would be a Security Council \r\nresolution on combating terrorism, but again that did \r\nnot happen. I read the first draft of such a resolution \r\nproposed by the Russian Federation, but that proposed \r\ndraft resolution has not yet been adopted. Unfortunately, \r\nmany of the Articles of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nbeginning with Article 39 and ending with Article 51, \r\ngo unused. For example, Article 47, on the Military \r\nStaff Committee, is, in United Nations terminology, \r\na “sleeping Article” or a “sleeping structure”. Let \r\nus therefore awaken it. Since we have those Articles \r\nand we have this Charter, we need to use them when \r\nthe appropriate opportunity arises. For without those \r\nmeasures, without coordinated military action based \r\non the common will of the permanent members of the \r\nSecurity Council, the spread of terrorism will continue, \r\nand we shall be faced with new assassinations, new \r\nfailed countries and new terrorist actions throughout \r\nthe world.\r\nLet me conclude with the old Roman oratorical phrase \r\nuttered frequently by Cato the Elder: “Ceterum autem \r\ncenseo Carthaginem esse delendam” — “Moreover, I \r\nbelieve that Carthage must be destroyed”. Deep in my \r\nheart I believe that someday we will overcome — not \r\nCarthage, but international terrorism.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Czech \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Miloš Zeman, President of the Czech Republic, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n22/25 16-29453\r\nAddress by Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional \r\nPresident of the Plurinational State of Bolivia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Constitutional President of the \r\nPlurinational State of Bolivia.\r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Evo Morales Ayma, \r\nConstitutional President of the Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Morales Ayma (spoke in Spanish): I am \r\nonce again participating in the regular session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to reaffirm our respect, admiration \r\nand congratulations to our brother, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nfor his contribution to the life of the peoples of the \r\nworld and of Mother Earth. We appreciate and express \r\nour deep respect for his work as Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations. I am also here to reiterate that we \r\nare living in a time of renewed global obscurantism, \r\nspurred by the capitalist and imperialist barbarism that \r\nis killing human dignity, the integrity of our common \r\nhome, Mother Earth, and the sovereignty of our \r\ncountries.\r\nMr. Sogavare (Solomon Islands), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\nToday, according to United Nations data, some \r\n94 per cent of the world’s wealth is in the hands of \r\na mere 20 per cent of the global population. More \r\nthan 800 million people in the world are suffering \r\nfrom hunger. This grim social reality is the true \r\nface of capitalism. Humankind’s main goals during \r\nthis century should be to eradicate capitalism and \r\nimperialism as the prevailing societal model. If we do \r\nnot build another model of society as soon as possible, \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals will be replaced \r\nwith the sustainable goals of death for all living things \r\nand Mother Earth. \r\nThis year has been the hottest in the history of \r\nthe planet, and each year is hotter than the previous \r\none. This year, Bolivia is also experiencing one of \r\nthe worst droughts in history. We have to be alert and \r\ntake immediate action to prevent the barbarism of \r\ncapitalism from transforming the Paris Agreement into \r\nan agreement of lies and blackmail. \r\nThe capitalist countries have built borders and \r\nwalls everywhere — on water, on land and in the air. \r\nOne out of every 100 people in the world is either a \r\nrefugee or someone displaced by global warming, \r\nwars or imperialist invasions, as occurred in Syria, \r\nIraq, Libya and other countries. We hope that all of the \r\nworld’s peoples can start building universal citizenship \r\nand one great country where people live in harmony \r\nand as part of a common family.\r\nThe expansionist and warmongering policies of the \r\nState of Israel and its allies are major expressions of \r\nbarbarism in the modern world. We strongly condemn \r\nIsrael’s attacks on the civilian population of Palestine \r\nand demand that Israel cease hostilities immediately. \r\nWe urge the United Nations to fully and immediately \r\nrecognize the State of Palestine and take tangible action \r\nto stop the brutal genocide of the Palestinian people.\r\nWe return to the General Assembly to express our \r\nstrong rejection of the coercive and unilateral economic \r\nmeasures imposed by the United States against Cuba for \r\npolitical reasons. It is not sufficient to restore diplomatic \r\nrelations. The United States must compensate Cuba \r\nfor the economic blockade and restore Guantanamo to \r\nCuban territorial sovereignty. \r\nWe commend the signing of the peace agreement \r\nbetween the Colombian Government and the \r\nRevolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia. It shows \r\nthat we are fulfilling the promise of membership in \r\nthe Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates — to make our region a zone of peace. We must \r\nnever forget that peace can be achieved only with social \r\njustice. We highlight and admire Cuba’s leadership in \r\nfacilitating the peace agreement. \r\nWe lament the fact that other Governments, such \r\nas that of the United States, perpetrate attacks, such as \r\nthe most recent bombing of military positions in Syria, \r\nwhich left dozens of soldiers dead or wounded. It shows \r\nthe hypocrisy and the ongoing non-compliance with the \r\ncommitments they undertook in the Syrian ceasefire \r\nagreement, announced by Russia and the United States \r\non 9 September in Geneva. \r\nWe condemn terrorism, violence and war, but in \r\norder to eliminate terrorism, we must attack the root \r\ncauses of this scourge for humankind. It must be said \r\nthat as long as wealth remains in the hands of a few, as \r\nlong as poverty and exclusion exist, as long as racism \r\nand discrimination persist, as long as the identity and \r\nthe sovereignty of peoples are not respected and their \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 23/25\r\nnatural resources are pillaged for imperialist purposes, \r\nthere will be grounds for violence and terrorism. We \r\nmust build a world of peace and equality with dignity \r\nand brotherhood among peoples. \r\nMany brother countries have been affected by the \r\nglobal economic crisis. In Bolivia, however, we have \r\ndeveloped policies and are taking measures to deal with \r\nthe repercussions of the global crisis in the capitalist \r\nsystem. Bolivia is leading economic growth in South \r\nAmerica, as it is one of the countries that has achieved \r\ncomplementarity among economic growth, distribution \r\nof wealth, public investment and a significant reduction \r\nin poverty while expanding equality. None of this would \r\nhave been possible without the sovereign measures it \r\nhas taken, such as the nationalization of our natural \r\nresources and strategic companies. \r\nImperialist interests are creating a process of \r\npolitical destabilization in our region. We condemn \r\nforeign political intervention in our brother country \r\nof Venezuela. We salute the revolutionary fight of \r\nthe people, undertaken with their leader, Commander \r\nMaduro. The new imperial conspiracy in the twenty-\r\nfirst century is no longer through coups d’état but rather \r\nthrough parliamentary or judicial takeovers. They may \r\nbe legal and constitutional, but they are not legitimate, \r\nnor do they respect the decisions of the people. \r\nWe express our deep concern about and rejection \r\nof the actions taken by the Secretary General of the \r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), which are in \r\nbreach of the basic principles of the United Nations. \r\nThe Organization of American States needs to be a true \r\nrepresentation of the all the countries of the Americas, \r\nand not an agent or mouthpiece for the interests of the \r\nUnited States. We do not need an imperial leader to \r\ncontrol our people. If the OAS does not represent or \r\nrespect, the sovereignty of its member States, it would \r\nbe better if it did not exist at all. \r\nLast week, on 18 September, the Heads of State \r\nand Government of the countries of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement met on Margarita Island, Venezuela, \r\nand strongly condemned action taken by the United \r\nStates of America relative to its Transnational Drug \r\nTrafficking Act of 2015, which involves implementing \r\nextraterritorial measures that violate the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. I take \r\nthis opportunity to inform members of the Assembly \r\nthat Bolivia, without military bases or the presence of \r\nthe United States Drug Enforcement Administration \r\n(DEA), is now faring better in the fight against drug \r\ntrafficking, and this fact has been recognized by the \r\nUnited Nations. \r\nI also note that thanks to a few police officers of \r\nour armed forces, we learned the following: when the \r\nDEA was in Bolivia, when it seized drugs, 50 per cent \r\nwere burned and 50 per cent went to DEA for trade. \r\nA Bolivian officer inquired about the latter 50 per \r\ncent, and the response was that the DEA used the \r\nmoney to pay off our police. Investigations that were \r\nconducted proved that the DEA was training police and \r\nmilitary personnel to plan the assassination of leaders. \r\nFor these reasons and many more, I would like to tell \r\nthose present in this Hall today that terrorism and drug \r\ntrafficking are twins that serve the imperial interests \r\nof the United States, which seeks to invade and control \r\nother countries around the world — I am completely \r\nconvinced of this. \r\nFurthermore, I recall that in 1879, the Bolivian \r\ncoast was invaded by Chilean and English transnational \r\nmilitary forces with a view to taking the substantial \r\nnatural resources there by force. For more than a \r\ncentury, Chile has expressly and repeatedly rejected \r\nthe pressing need for Bolivia to once again be a coastal \r\ncountry, and it has undertaken to negotiate with Bolivia \r\nthe restitution of maritime access.\r\nBolivia has relied in good faith on all the legal \r\ncommitments undertaken, which served as the basis \r\nof our claim brought before the International Court \r\nof Justice. The Court declared its jurisdiction over the \r\nmatter on 24 September 2015, after the Government of \r\nChile presented an objection regarding said jurisdiction. \r\nWe understand that these are times of dialogue, that we \r\nmust work together on solutions that will allow us to \r\nresolve pending matters peacefully and with the full \r\ninvolvement of the people. We invite Chile to put an \r\nend to one of the longest-lasting conflicts in the history \r\nof Latin America, whose solution continues to be an \r\noutstanding debt between our nations. The solution to \r\nthe conflict will benefit not only Bolivia but Chile and \r\nthe integration of Latin America as a whole. We are \r\ncertain that we will find a solution whereby everyone \r\nis a winner. \r\nI would like to thank the organizations of the \r\ninternational community and the various presidents, \r\nformer presidents and peoples of the world for their \r\nongoing support for Bolivia to regain sovereign access \r\nto the sea. I would also like to highlight the fact that \r\nA/71/PV.12 21/09/2016\r\n24/25 16-29453\r\nthe United Nations created an institution of such \r\nimportance, the International Court of Justice, so that \r\ninternational conflicts and controversies could be \r\nresolved peacefully. We trust that the Court will serve \r\njustice.\r\nOur greatest wish is to see the message of Pope \r\nFrancis become reality — to establish channels of \r\ndialogue and tear down the walls that divide us. We \r\nwant to launch a dialogue that satisfies the mutual \r\ninterests of our countries. In Bolivia, we are building \r\na country that will be an exemplar of equality, liberty \r\nwith dignity, and sovereignty for the world. For these \r\nreasons, we insist and will continue to insist that all \r\nbasic services must be recognized as human rights, and \r\nthat, further, we recognize and respect the rights of \r\nMother Earth. The new world order with social justice \r\nmust be built on the foundation of fraternity among \r\nnations and harmony with Mother Earth for the well-\r\nbeing of all of us. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Evo Morales Ayma, Constitutional President \r\nof the Plurinational State of Bolivia, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of \r\nthe Republic of Mozambique\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nMozambique.\r\nMr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mozambique, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nyusi (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): It is a great honour for \r\nme to address, on behalf of the people of Mozambique, \r\nthe General Assembly, the world’s highest forum for \r\npolitical and diplomatic discussion, at its seventy-first \r\nsession.\r\nI would first like to congratulate the President on \r\nhis election to lead the Assembly at this session and to \r\nthank the outgoing President, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for \r\nthe dedication with which he has fulfilled his mandate \r\nin the context of achieving fundamental commitments, \r\nnamely, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on financing \r\nfor development, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Sendai Framework for disaster risk \r\nreduction and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nAs we celebrate the first anniversary of the adoption \r\nof these important instruments, we are pleased to see \r\nthat the world and the United Nations system have been \r\nmaking progress with their implementation. Despite \r\nthose developments, however, we are cognizant of the \r\nchallenges that remain.\r\nThe theme for this session of the Assembly — “The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push to \r\ntransform our world” — could not be more appropriate, \r\nas the year 2016 has ushered in a new era for \r\nimplementing the global development agenda. The \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development reflects the \r\ncollective ambition for and global consensus on the \r\nimportance of accelerating the creation of the conditions \r\nfor ensuring that our efforts to eradicate poverty and \r\nbuild sustainable development are people-centred. \r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) therefore \r\nrepresent a tool with enormous potential for triggering \r\nprofound changes in our vision for development and \r\nensuring that no country or individual is left behind.\r\nThe major challenge to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals lies in their implementation, \r\nparticularly with regard to their alignment with global, \r\nregional and national instruments and resources, their \r\nfinancing, monitoring and evaluation of progress, \r\nand their inclusiveness. By integrating the dimension \r\nof peace and stability, the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals acknowledge the inseparability of peace and \r\ndevelopment and the need for each to be strengthened. \r\nOnly in this way can we build peaceful, just and \r\ninclusive societies, for which genuine political will is \r\nrequired. For this process to succeed, we urgently need \r\nto reposition the United Nations system so that it can \r\nrespond to current realities.\r\nThere can be no doubt that the global transformation \r\nthat the SDGs are aiming to achieve will require \r\nstructural changes in the way we design and implement \r\nour major national development agendas in the short, \r\nmedium and long term. In that regard, Mozambique’s \r\n2015-2019 five-year Government programme, our \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.12\r\n16-29453 25/25\r\nblueprint for governance, already reflects some of \r\nthe principles and the three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn order to mainstream, monitor and report on our \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwe recently established a national reference group \r\ncomprising representatives from the Government, \r\nParliament, civil society, the private sector and \r\ncooperating partners. The group’s task is to follow up on \r\nprogress on the indicators selected to assess targets up \r\nto 2030, as well as to deal with policy measures, funding \r\npossibilities and any factor that may have an effect \r\non the successful implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Through the group’s broad-based \r\nintervention, our goal is to make the implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals more inclusive, \r\nconsistent and transparent, and something which all the \r\nvarious stakeholders can feel part of.\r\nThe third International Conference on Financing \r\nfor Development, held in Addis Ababa in July 2015, \r\nrecommended that countries use their own frameworks \r\nand means to respond to the new development agenda. \r\nThe Conference advised Member States to develop \r\ncomprehensive and integrated funding strategies that \r\ngo beyond traditional procedures for public budgeting. \r\nIn that context, and as part of our commitment to \r\ncontinuing to mobilize more resources, Mozambique \r\nhas established a national fund for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In addition, we have begun evaluating \r\nthe f low of development financing, with the aim, on \r\nthe one hand, of facilitating a system for viewing the \r\ndevelopment results for each of the country’s available \r\nfinancial f lows, and, on the other hand, of exploring \r\noptions for the coherent integration of Government \r\npriorities with those of the international agenda.\r\nTo complement the foregoing efforts, we continue \r\nto urge the revitalization of the Global Partnership \r\nfor Sustainable Development and support for the \r\nrelevance of the principle of shared but differentiated \r\nresponsibility. We also advocate for the importance \r\nof ensuring that partners honour their commitments \r\nundertaken within the framework of the internationally \r\nagreed development goals and of the predictability \r\nof development aid, based on the provisions of the \r\nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness. With the \r\nhelp of those tools we will be able to establish sound \r\ninstitutional foundations for the efficient and effective \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, helping to fulfil the “universal push to \r\ntransform our world”.\r\nMaking our global agenda a reality requires a \r\ncollective commitment on the part of all of us to \r\nstrengthening multilateral institutions. To that end, \r\nwe continue to believe firmly in the importance of \r\nreforming the United Nations as a whole and the \r\nSecurity Council in particular, as well as changing \r\nthe architecture of international financial institutions \r\non the basis of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and \r\nimproving cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nregional economic organizations, particularly where the \r\nprevention and resolution of conflicts are concerned.\r\nAs we meet today in this Hall, we reaffirm our \r\ncommitment to the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, a universal Organization \r\nwith a mandate to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity and to defend human rights. We recognize the \r\nUnited Nations as an essential platform for political and \r\ndiplomatic discussion and international cooperation on \r\npeace and development. In that regard, we would like to \r\nexpress our appreciation for the excellent and successful \r\njob that Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has done in \r\ncompleting his mandate to lead the Organization for \r\ntwo terms. We hope that under its soon-to-be-elected \r\nincoming Secretary-General, the United Nations will \r\nstrengthen its relations with Mozambique, particularly \r\nin terms of helping us to implement the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. We also look forward to seeing \r\nthe implementation of reforms that will make our \r\nOrganization more democratic, more representative \r\nand better able to serve all nations and peoples of the \r\nworld.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate our \r\ncommitment to continuing our exemplary cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations and all its Member States \r\nin order to achieve our noble objectives, particularly \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, and to build a \r\nprosperous, peaceful world for the benefit of all its \r\npeoples.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Filipe Jacinto Nyusi, President of the Republic \r\nof Mozambique, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
