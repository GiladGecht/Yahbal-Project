"United Nations A/71/PV.13\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n13th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 21 September 2016, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Ms. Francis \r\n(Bahamas), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of \r\nthe Republic of Estonia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nEstonia.\r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Estonia, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ilves: I address the General Assembly \r\ntoday for my tenth and last time. The first time I spoke \r\nhere (see A/62/PV.5), I addressed climate change, \r\nconflict, refugees and — what was apparently a \r\nfirst at the General Assembly — cyberattacks as the \r\ncontinuation of policy by other means.\r\nThe issues are therefore largely the same, and \r\nonly the urgency that we sense has been ratcheted up. \r\nCertainly, the world was more stable then. It was before \r\nthe economic and migration crises, the current conflicts \r\nin the wider Middle East, or Russia’s aggression against \r\nGeorgia and Ukraine. It was also before the war on \r\ntruth and facts that seems to have taken over in many \r\nplaces. Despite our concerns at the time, we lived in a \r\nmore stable world, where optimism had not yet become \r\nnaiveté. Today, in too many parts of the world, we find \r\na conflict either emerging, raging or frozen. Terrorism, \r\nalways a scourge, dominates our daily headlines in all \r\nparts of the world.\r\nNot all of today’s conflicts and crises could have \r\nbeen prevented, yet the effect of many could have \r\nbeen mitigated had we acted sooner or had the proper \r\nmechanisms to resolve them been in place. When \r\nI addressed the Assembly in the wake of Russia’s \r\ninvasion of Georgia in 2008 (see A/63/PV.8), I warned \r\nnot to apply international law selectively. International \r\nlaw had clearly been violated, yet little was done. Six \r\nyears later, in 2014, we saw a repeat performance in \r\nUkraine. Part of a sovereign State was annexed and \r\nanother part turned into a war zone. For the first time \r\nsince the Second World War, borders in Europe had \r\nbeen changed through the use of force. The prohibition \r\non the use of force to change borders lies at the heart \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. It was blatantly \r\nviolated, and yet the United Nations could not make a \r\ndifference. Russia’s aggression in Ukraine continues. \r\nThe territories of Ukraine and Georgia remain occupied \r\nby a foreign military force, and frozen conflicts persist \r\nin Nagorno Karabakh and Transnistria.\r\nWe need global norms. Just as we need international \r\nlaw, we also need the mechanisms to enforce it. Unless \r\nthe United Nations starts to do more, it will, over time, \r\nlose relevance. When we face a global challenge, the \r\nUnited Nations should be the first place to come to for \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

I raise the issue not only because it is a \r\ncrisis, but also because I myself am a child of refugees. \r\nWhat we face is not — I stress — an unprecedented \r\ncrisis, as so many have averred. We have faced far \r\nworse refugee crises and we have prevailed. In the \r\nEurope of 1946, Germany alone had 12 million internal \r\nrefugees and another 12 million displaced persons of \r\n20 different nationalities. Other countries in the post-\r\nwar shambles and ruin of Europe at the time were not \r\nin much better shape. Yet we prevailed, or rather our \r\ngrandparents did. In three years, the United Nations \r\nRelief and Rehabilitation Administration — and I stress \r\nthe first two words of the name of this agency — spent \r\nin today’s money approximately €50 billion to resolve \r\nthat crisis. It took political will, courage and far more \r\nmoney to solve that crisis than we are willing to spend \r\ntoday.\r\nMigration is our common challenge. A sustainable \r\nsolution to this complex problem lies in addressing its \r\ncauses. Yet we also must fulfil our commitments under \r\ninternational conventions on the protection of refugees. \r\nSuch commitments already exist. They are not some \r\nvague future goal to which we pledge. \r\nMigrant children are at the heart of migration \r\ninflux. Children on the move or otherwise affected \r\nby migration are the most vulnerable group, who, \r\nlacking agency, face limited access to justice and \r\nsocial and health services and therefore often suffer \r\nhorrible abuse. One significant challenge is to provide \r\neducation to the children in refugee camps. Depriving \r\nthem of education will damage the prospects of refugee \r\nand asylum-seeking children, leave them behind \r\nand, at the same time, increase the risk of the kind of \r\nalienation that often leads later to extremism. We have \r\nseen this where refugee camps have been in place for a \r\nlong time — sometimes for generations — begetting a \r\ncontinuing crop of disaffected, alienated and radicalized \r\nyouth who feel that they have nothing to lose.\r\nThe ongoing conflicts we see around the world \r\nwill, if we do not take control, breed a terrorism that \r\nknows no bounds. Estonia reaffirms its commitment \r\nto working together to prevent and counter terrorism, \r\nwhich is why we participate in the Global Coalition to \r\nCounter the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant.\r\nEstonia firmly supports the International Criminal \r\nCourt and its quest to end impunity. Countries,  whether \r\nor not they have joined the Rome Statute, must set an \r\nexample of non-aggression, self-restraint and respect \r\nfor the rule of law. We believe that a commitment to \r\nfighting impunity at all levels is the only way to deter \r\nthose who might commit crimes in future.\r\nIn 2005, the States Members of the United Nations \r\ncommitted to the principle of responsibility to protect, \r\nbetter known as R2P, and to fight genocide, war \r\ncrimes, ethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity. \r\nHowever, the brutality we see in Syria shows that an \r\neffective solution lies beyond the grasp of the United \r\nNations. When a Government fails to live up to its \r\ncommitments, when it violates the fundamental norms \r\nof civilized behaviour — let alone the tenets of the \r\nUnited Nations — the international community must \r\nact. In this respect, the Security Council bears primary \r\nresponsibility. Council members that veto or vote \r\nagainst actions aimed at preventing mass atrocities \r\ncarry co-responsibility for those atrocities.\r\nA primary criticism directed at the United Nations \r\ntoday is the Security Council’s inability or unwillingness \r\nto respond to major crises. Estonia cannot speak from \r\nfirst-hand experience, as we have not yet served in \r\nthe Council; we have merely observed. We want, \r\nhowever, to bring the spirit of openness, transparency \r\nand inclusiveness to the Council’s work, and hence are \r\nrunning for a non-permanent seat for 2020-2021. We \r\nare convinced that the role of the General Assembly \r\nand the non-permanent members of the Council must \r\nbe increased. \r\nThe majority of States Members of the United \r\nNations are small countries. As we look at the history \r\nof conflict since the Second World War, small countries \r\nare almost invariably the victims of conflict, not the \r\nabetters. This is nothing new. In the Melian Dialogue \r\nat the heart of his History of the Peloponnesian Wars, \r\nThucydides famously concluded that “the strong do \r\nwhat they will, the weak suffer what they must”. That \r\nis why we have international law — to protect the weak \r\nand the small. Their voices must be better heard and \r\ntheir rights must be upheld. Estonia, as a member of the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency Group, is \r\nworking together with a number of other countries to \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 3/30\r\nimprove the working methods of the Security Council \r\nso as to bring about badly needed changes.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are effective \r\ntools for advancing security and stability, spurring \r\neconomic growth, eradicating poverty, preserving \r\nthe environment and promoting human development. \r\nTaking that commitment seriously, Estonia was among \r\nthe first countries to present our voluntary national \r\nreview on the implementation of SDGs during the \r\nHigh-level Political Forum.\r\nEstonia attaches great importance to the Goal \r\nof achieving gender equality that can unlock the \r\neconomic potential of women. More equal societies \r\nwork better for everyone. Achieving gender equality is \r\nfirst and foremost the duty of political leaders and the \r\nGovernments that they lead. Amid current conflicts, it \r\nis important to ensure that women do not fall victim to \r\ngender-based violence. It is also important that they be \r\nincluded in conflict resolution and peace negotiations. \r\nIt is therefore imperative to continue to implement \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1325 (2000) and related \r\nresolutions on women and peace and security.\r\nFree media is an integral, even inseparable, part of \r\nmodern and democratic society, where Governments \r\nlisten to criticism, which, after all, forms part of what \r\nwe call the voice of the people. Yet all around the \r\nglobe, we see that critical voices — and even those \r\nthat merely report the facts — face reprisals, jail and \r\nviolence. The United Nations Plan of Action on the \r\nSafety of Journalists and the Issue of Impunity must \r\nbe implemented if we are to change the absurdity that \r\nreporting facts is a life-threatening activity.\r\nFor Estonia, a leader of innovation in the digital \r\nworld, the right to freedom of opinion and expression \r\nonline and offline is a fundamental issue. Digital \r\ntechnology has been a liberating force, yet some would \r\nturn it into a means to control citizens. As a founder \r\nof the Freedom Online Coalition, Estonia is a donor \r\nto the Digital Defenders Partnership, contributing to \r\nthe protection of the rights of journalists, bloggers \r\nand human-rights defenders online. In times of rapid \r\ndevelopments in information and communications \r\ntechnology, the protection of human rights and the rule \r\nof law must keep pace.\r\nThe right to freedom of expression also means \r\nkeeping the Internet free and unrestricted. In other \r\nwords, digital freedom of expression in no way differs \r\nfrom freedom of expression in the analog world. \r\nCensorship, illicit filtering and the online blocking of \r\nopposition voices thwarts democracy no less than when \r\nthe printed word is censored. \r\nAn open Internet is an amplifier of economic growth \r\nand thus a crucial element of sustainable development in \r\nthe twenty-first century. That is an essential conclusion, \r\nincidentally, of the World Bank’s World Development \r\nReport 2016, entitled “Digital Dividends”, whose \r\npreparation I co-chaired. Information technology can \r\nlead to transparent governance and economic growth \r\nbut only if it is open and unfettered.\r\nThe challenges we face in the coming years are \r\nenormous. Estonia firmly believes in a rules-based \r\ninternational order. The only international organization \r\nglobal enough to achieve that end is the United Nations.\r\nFinally, let me say that the 10 times I have appeared \r\nhere over the past decade have been genuinely rewarding \r\nexperiences, and I trust that my successor will continue \r\nto believe in the work that the Assembly does. I would \r\nlike to thank the members for their attention and for all \r\nthat they have given me.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Estonia for the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Toomas Hendrik Ilves, President of the \r\nRepublic of Estonia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nNauru.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nauru, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\nPresident Waqa: It is an honour to be in this Hall \r\nfor the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. \r\nOn behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would like to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n4/30 16-29503\r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly. \r\nIt is wonderful to see one of my Pacific Island brothers \r\nat the helm of this body. Let me assure him of the full \r\nsupport of my delegation as he leads the important \r\nwork of the Assembly. I would also like to thank \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, our outgoing \r\nPresident, for his exceptional work.\r\nI would like to say to the incoming President that \r\nhis position comes with enormous responsibility, and \r\nthe upcoming session will be more important than \r\nmost. Every time we turn on the television, we are \r\ntreated to images of turmoil. From violent extremism \r\nto political upheaval, to large-scale migration and a \r\nclimate in chaos, the world is at a crossroads and the \r\nGeneral Assembly will decide its path. \r\nFortunately, the 193 Members of the United \r\nNations have given us some detailed road maps to \r\nguide our work: the Small Island Developing States \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action Pathway, the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda on financing for development, and the \r\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction. Those \r\nuniversal agreements capture the collective will of the \r\ninternational community. Such agreements point the \r\nway towards greater cooperation, and Nauru is deeply \r\ncommitted to their full implementation. \r\nThe commitments that we have made to each other \r\nrepresent our best efforts to meet the challenges before \r\nus, and we made those commitments knowing that \r\nsome of us need help to fulfil them. We agreed that \r\nno country should be left behind. Now begins the most \r\nimportant work: translating our words into concrete \r\naction. Our primary task is to direct resources to where \r\nthey will matter most.\r\nWe should not underestimate the difficulty of such \r\na task. Some international funding mechanisms exclude \r\nsmall countries like mine, or prove impossible to access \r\nbecause of the limited capacity of small countries. \r\nPrivate investment is unreliable and rarely available \r\nto support basic services and critical infrastructure. \r\nMeanwhile, the most promising financing models for \r\nsmall developing countries — direct access and direct \r\nbudgetary support, for example  — are rarely available as \r\nan option. That needs to change, so that small countries \r\ncan fully benefit from the historic agreements we have \r\nreached.\r\nNauru is asking a lot from its development partners. \r\nWe want to be better partners ourselves. Our efforts \r\nmust, therefore, go beyond capacity-building to focus \r\non institution-building. Those efforts must be backed \r\nby real resources and include the long-term, in-country \r\nengagement of international and regional agencies. The \r\ngoal must be nothing short of building durable domestic \r\ninstitutions that are run by a skilled national workforce. \r\nOn that note, let me thank our partners Australia, \r\nTaiwan, Japan, the Russian Federation, Cuba, New \r\nZealand and others for their support to our sustainable \r\ndevelopment priorities.\r\nThe implementation of Sustainable Development \r\nGoal (SDG) 14 — the sustainable use of the oceans, seas \r\nand marine resources — is a high priority. The ocean is \r\na pillar of our small island economy, our environment \r\nand our culture. Stresses on marine biodiversity are \r\nmounting, including those that go beyond national \r\njurisdiction. The gaps in our governance of the \r\noceans must therefore be addressed. We urge a timely \r\nand comprehensive conclusion of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee process on developing an international \r\ninstrument on the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biological biodiversity in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction. The upcoming United Nations Conference \r\nto Support the Implementation of SDG 14 presents a \r\nwelcome and much-needed opportunity to foster a \r\nshared vision for a healthy, productive and resilient \r\nocean to guide all our ocean-related activities.\r\nLet me also highlight the importance of the long-\r\nterm conservation and sustainable use of our fisheries. \r\nThe parties to the Nauru Agreement are on the cutting \r\nedge of sustainable fisheries management. However, \r\nthe international community must ensure that a \r\ndisproportionate burden of conservation measures does \r\nnot fall on the small island developing States (SIDS). \r\nThe burden and costs of those measures must be shared \r\nequitably.\r\nThe full implementation of our international \r\ncommitments takes on much greater urgency in the \r\nface of climate change. That is why Nauru was among \r\nthe first countries in the world to ratify the Paris \r\nAgreement. It is encouraging to hear that we are on \r\ntrack for the Agreement’s entry into force this year. \r\nHowever, it is far too early to celebrate. The Paris \r\nAgreement is not the end of our climate work. It is only \r\nthe beginning.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 5/30\r\nGreenhouse gas emissions over the past 150 year \r\nhave pushed the climate system beyond the boundaries of \r\nhuman experience. Brewing superstorms and droughts \r\ncan be as destructive as any bomb. Sea-level rise can \r\noccupy our territory just as surely as an invading army. \r\nFrom the perspective of my small island nation in the \r\nPacific, climate change is our greatest humanitarian \r\ncrisis. It is our war, and while Nauru will be among the \r\nfirst to experience the worst impacts, climate change \r\nwill be the rest of the world’s humanitarian challenge \r\nas well.\r\nThe Paris Agreement notwithstanding, the \r\ndangerous climate impacts will continue to grow worse \r\nover the coming decades. We have little understanding \r\nof how our human systems will hold up under climate \r\nstress. Global supply chains, finance and insurance \r\nmarkets, food and water distribution — those systems \r\nare complex and interlinked and form the foundation \r\nof our modern civilization. Climate change raises \r\nsome hard questions, and I am not sure we have the \r\nanswers. Can we feed a planet of 9 billion people \r\nwhen crop yields are projected to fall? Will we learn \r\nto share declining freshwater resources as the glaciers \r\ndisappear? Will we be able to protect the millions who \r\nare rendered homeless when low-lying coastal areas are \r\ninundated? And can these and many other challenges \r\nbe managed effectively so that we avoid a proliferation \r\nof failed States?\r\nWe are simply not prepared. For that reason, Nauru \r\ncalls on Members to support the proposal by the Pacific \r\nSIDS to appoint a United Nations special representative \r\non climate and security. The security implications of \r\nclimate change will define the twenty-first century, and \r\nwe must prepare.\r\nRegarding the Security Council, Nauru supports \r\nexpanding the number of permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers in the Council. It is time to reflect the \r\ngeopolitical realities of today, not those of 70 years ago. \r\nThe persistence of the current arrangement continues \r\nto cast a shadow of illegitimacy over everything we do \r\nat the United Nations. If we are to nurture the spirit \r\nof cooperation represented by the historic agreements \r\nof 2015, then we must reform the most powerful organ \r\nof the United Nations. And we support the inclusion \r\nof India, Japan, Germany, Brazil and others in the \r\npermanent category.\r\nNauru welcomes the restored diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States. However, we call \r\nupon the United States to completely lift its economic \r\nembargo immediately.\r\nNauru is deeply concerned about the situation \r\nin West Papua, including the alleged human rights \r\nabuses there. As emphasized in the Pacific Islands \r\nForum communiqué, it is important that an open and \r\nconstructive dialogue take place with Indonesia on that \r\nmatter.\r\nNauru is also concerned by the mounting tensions \r\nprovoked by the recent action of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. The Pacific region saw far too much \r\nviolence and suffering during the previous century. We \r\nmust not allow the scourge of war to return. Nuclear \r\nproliferation has no place in a sustainable world.\r\nI would like to address the situation of Nauru’s \r\nclose friend, Taiwan. According to the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, our mission here is \r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in \r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the \r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large \r\nand small”.\r\nThe 23 million people of the Republic of China should \r\ntherefore enjoy those same fundamental rights. Taiwan \r\nhas contributed to the World Health Assembly and the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization. The people \r\nare promoting the Sustainable Development Goals \r\ndomestically and internationally, and they are helping \r\nto lead the way towards a low-carbon economy. Taiwan \r\nis a key stakeholder in the international community. We \r\nshould make efforts to regularize their participation \r\nthroughout the United Nations system, so that we can \r\nall benefit from their substantial contributions.\r\nLastly, I would like to extend my country’s deep \r\nappreciation for the work of the current Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon. He has been a true friend \r\nof small islands. We are thankful for his leadership on \r\nmany of the issues that we hold most dear. His most \r\nenduring legacy may perhaps be to have raised climate \r\nchange to the top of the international agenda, but his \r\ntireless efforts to ensure that no country, no matter how \r\nsmall, is left behind is just as important. He was the \r\nfirst sitting Secretary-General to make an official visit \r\nto Pacific small island developing States, and he has an \r\nopen invitation to visit Nauru.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to say that the United Nations \r\nis at a crossroads. While the Charter of the United \r\nNations is rooted in the equality of nations, we do not \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n6/30 16-29503\r\nalways live up to that principle. There are still times \r\nwhen only some of us hold the pen, some sit at the table \r\nand some are locked out behind a closed door. A small \r\ngroup of countries has the real power to give us the \r\nnecessary push to transform our world. They can make \r\nsure that resources are directed to where they matter. \r\nWe need those countries to carry forward the goals and \r\nobjectives that we have spent so many years negotiating, \r\neven in those exclusive rooms when the rest of us are \r\nnot present.\r\nThe power of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment stems from its legitimacy. It was the \r\nproduct of a truly open and transparent process that \r\nreflected the hopes and aspirations of all 193 States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. We all sat at the table \r\nand held the pen together. I implore our partners to \r\nremember that. Now, we are entrusting the President \r\nof the General Assembly with taking that work forward \r\nand holding us accountable for our commitments. From \r\none Pacific Islander to another, he has our complete \r\nconfidence. \r\nMay God bless the Republic of Nauru. May God \r\nbless the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nNauru for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Juan Orlando \r\nHernández Alvarado, President of the Republic \r\nof Honduras\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nHonduras.\r\nMr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President \r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Juan Orlando Hernández \r\nAlvarado, President of the Republic of Honduras, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Hernández Alvarado (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me begin by congratulating the President of \r\nthe General Assembly on his election to guide this \r\norgan. I wish him every success for the well-being of \r\nhumankind.\r\nOur country is asking for major reforms and \r\ntransformations. We understand that it is up to our \r\ngeneration to shoulder the responsibility of continuing \r\nto press for the changes that need to take place in order \r\nto bring about a better world. In 2009, we emerged from \r\na deep political crisis that had serious economic and \r\nsocial consequences, especially for the most vulnerable \r\nof my people. The economy was in the red. We could \r\nnot pay civil servants. Economic growth decreased, \r\npoverty increased. By neglecting security and safety, \r\nhomicides grew unchecked. Institutions were allowed \r\nto become contaminated by drug trafficking and \r\norganized crime. We suffered. Above and beyond the \r\ncrisis of public confidence in the country’s institutions, \r\nthere was also the fact that Honduras was perceived as \r\na very unsafe country by the rest of the world. And so \r\nwe ended up being isolated. \r\nWith much effort, we have been able to restore our \r\ndemocracy, and today all political points of view in \r\nHonduras are represented by political parties. Less than \r\nthree years ago, upon a decision taken by the Honduran \r\npeople, we began to tread the right path. It has not \r\nbeen easy. On 27 January 2014, we began restoring our \r\ncountry, with support from various sectors of society \r\nthat believed in our future. They were betting on the \r\nright path — on the construction of a new Honduras. \r\nThirty-two months later, what have we achieved since \r\nwe began that task? \r\nIn the economic field, we have seen a reduction in \r\nthe fiscal deficit to less than 5 per cent of the gross \r\ndomestic product, with sustained economic growth, \r\nwhereas the larger economies in our continent were \r\nstagnating. There has been improvement in foreign \r\ninvestment and in productive infrastructure. We have \r\nseen an increase in tax revenues. We have also seen an \r\nimprovement in our credit and risk rating. We also have \r\na national economic development programme called \r\nHonduras 2020. It seeks to double private investment \r\nand the number of jobs created over the next 5 years in \r\nstrategic sectors of our national economy.\r\nIn the area of public safety, we have achieved \r\nthe dismantling of the main drug cartels, which were \r\nresponsible for the most tragic violence in the history of \r\nour country. We have begun to break up the activities of \r\ncriminal bandits, and we have captured 274 ringleaders \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 7/30\r\nof gangs and bandit groups. We began a very positive, \r\naggressive process of cleaning up the police. We worked \r\non strengthening the Office of the Public Prosecutor and \r\nthe intelligence capacity of the State. We have started \r\nto fight corruption and impunity, which had been one of \r\nour primary concerns, and have had notable successes.\r\nIn April 2015, in order to deepen that campaign, \r\nwe implemented, with the support of the Organization \r\nof American States, a mission to aid us in our fight \r\nagainst corruption and impunity in Honduras. This has \r\nled to a frontal attack on criminals that has resulted in a \r\ndecline in violence, reflected in a 26 per cent reduction \r\nin the homicide rate. Most importantly, we have saved \r\nlives — lives of thousands of our fellow citizens. In \r\nthe fight against organized crime, we have enjoyed \r\nclose international cooperation, based on trust. We \r\nhave brought before the courts corrupt public servants, \r\nbusiness owners and people active in the security and \r\njustice fields who have committed crimes and violations \r\nof human rights. We have extradited, for judgment \r\noutside the country, 12 Hondurans and 5 foreigners \r\naccused of drug trafficking or organized crime. Today, \r\nwe are no longer the first, second, third, fourth or fifth \r\nmost violent country in the world, according to the \r\nGlobal Peace Index 2016.\r\nIn the social area, we have reached out with \r\nfinancial assistance to 275,000 families living in \r\nextreme poverty in order to improve the indicators for \r\nthe health and education of their minor children. Some \r\n1.2 million persons receive benefits to improve their \r\nliving conditions with cement f loors, decent roofs, \r\ntoilets, eco-friendly stoves and water filters. We have \r\nreduced illiteracy by expanding preschool and have \r\nincreased the coverage of intermediate and secondary \r\neducation. Approximately 1.2 million children receive \r\nschool lunches, and 1.3 million people have access to \r\ndecentralized health-care services. We have tripled the \r\npurchasing of medications, attaining an average of 80 per \r\ncent of the requirements in our public hospitals. We \r\nhave launched a campaign against non-communicable \r\nchronic diseases, with a focus on those occurring in \r\nearly infancy, as well as programmes for the prevention \r\nof adolescent pregnancies.\r\nBut we recognize that much more remains to be \r\ndone. We must not lose sight of the future. We cannot \r\nlose our way nor abandon the good path that we have \r\nset out on. Our country, Honduras, is committed to \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nThree other issues deserve special attention in this \r\ndebate at the United Nations: climate change, migratory \r\nf lows and the rights of victims.\r\nWith reference to climate change, Honduras has \r\nsuffered three consecutive years of a drought that \r\nhas affected food production and endangered food \r\nsecurity for nearly 250,000 families. Drought and high \r\ntemperatures have also led to the proliferation of a very \r\ndestructive insect, the southern pine-bark beetle, which \r\nstrips the bark off pine trees and has devastated one \r\nsixth of our forests.\r\nTo deal with those challenges, we have responded \r\nwith a food-assistance programme directed towards \r\nthe families at risk, and for three years we have \r\nexperienced no famine. In those efforts, we have \r\nreceived the assistance of the United Nations and \r\nfriendly Governments, which have contributed financial \r\nresources to complement our national resources. We \r\nhave also taken action against the pine-bark beetle. We \r\nare investing our own resources and enjoy the technical \r\nassistance of friendly countries. In addition, we have \r\nbegun a programme to construct water reservoirs \r\nand irrigation systems for small farms in dry areas, \r\ncomplemented by technical assistance and inputs for our \r\nfarmers. We are developing a comprehensive policy on \r\nthe land, forests and water so that we can successfully \r\nconfront the enormous challenges that countries like \r\nours face in climate change.\r\nThis morning, we submitted to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral our ratification instrument for the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. We Hondurans have \r\ncomplied. I wish to recall a statement I made at the \r\ntwenty-first Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nheld in Paris, to the effect that the accounts were not \r\nclear, and I must reiterate once more that the accounts \r\nremain unclear. That is why I would invite the countries \r\nthat have not as yet submitted their ratification to do \r\nso. I advise the United Nations and other international \r\norganizations to take prompt action to make the \r\nAgreement effective so that we will see pragmatic \r\nresults from the green funds. I firmly believe that \r\nsolutions need to come at the same pace as the problems. \r\nThe accounts will not be clear until we achieve concrete \r\nresults.\r\nOn the issue of migration, the growing economy, \r\nthe creation of economic opportunity, security and the \r\nresponse to climate change are all creating better living \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n8/30 16-29503\r\nconditions for our people in Honduras, and with all that \r\nwe are attacking some of the major causes of irregular \r\nmigration. The problems that confront our countries \r\nare becoming less national and more transnational \r\nin character. Political borders have become less \r\nsignificant, and the success of one country increasingly \r\ndepends on that of other countries.\r\nOrganized crime is a transnational monster. It \r\nknows no nationality and no scruples. It wears many \r\nfaces — the movement of capital, the movement of \r\ncriminals and trafficking in persons, weapons and \r\ndrugs, among others. The challenges that currently \r\nconfront countries like Honduras are produced by \r\ndecisions and actions taken both in the public sector \r\nand in the private sector. They are of transnational \r\norigin and have transnational consequences. Clearly, \r\nthey must be resolved in a transnational way.\r\nThe refugee crisis and migratory f lows are not \r\nproblems just for a single country. Drug trafficking \r\nis not a cause or effect produced by a single State. \r\nThe same holds true for climate change, which is a \r\nproblem for all of humankind. Owing to our geographic \r\nposition, Honduras has recently seen an alarming \r\nf low of migrants from our continent, as well as from \r\nother continents. In just a single year, the volume of \r\nmigratory f lows through our territory has increased \r\n300 per cent. In that light, today I must affirm that \r\nmigration is a global issue of global interest requiring \r\na global solution.\r\nOur Governments are finding transnational \r\nsolutions to our regional problems, for example by \r\ndriving forward the development initiatives that \r\nHonduras, together with El Salvador, Guatemala and \r\nNicaragua, has launched with regard to the Gulf of \r\nFonseca, on the Pacific coast. We have also formalized \r\nthe first customs union on the continent with the \r\nGovernment of Guatemala. That new economic space \r\nrepresents half of the Central American population and \r\napproximately half of the gross domestic product of our \r\nregion. If we incorporate the other countries of Central \r\nAmerica into the customs integration initiative, we shall \r\ntogether become the seventh largest Latin American \r\neconomy. Furthermore, El Salvador, Guatemala and \r\nHonduras, together with the United States, have created \r\nan alliance for prosperity. We have invited the United \r\nNations, as well as other countries from Latin America, \r\nEurope and Asia, to join in that initiative. Together, \r\nwe have also developed international instruments to \r\nprotect and promote human rights.\r\nHowever, in the face of aggression by common \r\ncriminals and terrorists, we have failed to protect \r\nthe image of the victims of those attacks. Quite the \r\ncontrary, the use of force and the resort to terror and \r\nviolence have been exalted and promoted. That has \r\ncontaminated respect for the dignity of human persons, \r\nthanks to the way in which their images and stories have \r\nbeen presented by the media. The criminals themselves \r\nuse the media to highlight their violent acts, promoting \r\nand continuing to perpetrate them. As in other countries \r\nthat have experienced criminal violence, in addition to \r\nthe pain of the loss of human lives and of losing our \r\npeace, we have experienced a sense of injustice when \r\nthe rights of victims and the rights of their relatives and \r\nfriends are not respected.\r\nI ask myself, the Assembly and all of humankind: \r\nDo the victims of violence have no rights? Is the cruelty \r\nwith which these human beings have been treated not \r\napparent? Where is the sympathy for their family \r\nand friends? Do they not deserve to be respected? \r\nWith whom lies the responsibility to inform them of \r\nsuch bloody events? What about the responsibilities \r\nof those who do not condemn the violence? Why is \r\nthe inheritance of the material goods of the deceased \r\nrespected, but the protection of their image and dignity \r\nis not? \r\nRecently in our country, Hondurans witnessed a \r\nchild taking the hand of his father’s corpse. His father \r\nhad lost his life on a public road as the consequence of \r\na criminal act. That image was broadcast throughout \r\nall media and social networks. It made me reflect and \r\nwonder about the extent of the rights of that child. How \r\nfar do the rights of the family of that child extend? I \r\ninvite everyone to reflect on that issue, which affects \r\nnot only the victims but also those closest to them. \r\nSuch problems have had a significant impact on entire \r\ncommunities and entire generations that have become \r\ndesensitized to such abominable events and grow up \r\nconsidering fear, intimidation and aggression to be part \r\nof everyday life. I believe that victims, too, have rights. \r\nLet us reflect upon that.\r\nToday Honduras calls on Member States to \r\nwork together to face the challenges and to be part \r\nof the solutions. Today, the time has come to act \r\nwith determination and commitment. I invite the \r\nAssembly to solve problems together by assuming the \r\nresponsibilities that are incumbent on each of us.\r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 9/30\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly I thank the President of the Republic of \r\nHonduras for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Juan Orlando Hernández Alvarado, President \r\nof the Republic of Honduras, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued) \r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Her Excellency Ms. Isatou Njie \r\nSaidy, Vice-President and Minister for \r\nWomen’s Affairs of the Islamic Republic of \r\nthe Gambia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President and Minister for \r\nWomen’s Affairs of the Islamic Republic of the Gambia.\r\nMs. Njie Saidy, Vice-President and Minister for \r\nWomen’s Affairs of the Islamic Republic of the \r\nGambia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming Her Excellency Ms. Isatou Njie Saidy, \r\nVice-President and Minister for Women’s Affairs of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of the Gambia, and inviting her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMs. Njie Saidy (Gambia): First and foremost, I \r\nbring greetings from His Excellency Sheikh Alhaji \r\nYahya Abdul-Aziz Jemus Junkung Jammeh Babili \r\nMansa, President of the Islamic Republic of the Gambia. \r\nI have the singular honour of reading out his statement, \r\nwhich is as follows: \r\n“I bring fraternal greetings from the people \r\nof the Islamic Republic of the Gambia. I wish to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session, an important and coveted position. His \r\nelection is an eloquent testimony to his diplomatic \r\nacumen, and I can assure him of the support of the \r\nGambian people, including the Gambian delegation \r\nhere present, during his stewardship.\r\n“In the same vein, I wish to express deep \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, for the able and efficient manner in \r\nwhich he conducted the affairs of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. He will surely \r\nbe remembered for the bold and major initiatives \r\nthat were launched during his tenure as President. \r\nI also wish to extend sincere thanks to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his tireless efforts in \r\npursuit of world peace and economic progress over \r\nthe past decade.\r\n“The world is at a crossroads. Since the \r\nprevious General Assembly session, global peace \r\nand security have steadily deteriorated. Wars in the \r\nMiddle East have intensified with alarming ferocity \r\nand unprecedented human casualties. In Africa, \r\nfratricidal wars in the Horn of Africa and in Libya \r\npose the greatest threat to peace and stability on the \r\ncontinent. It is also a source of great concern that, \r\ndespite the dangerous situations in Syria, Iraq and \r\nLibya, geopolitical interests continue to override \r\nhumanitarian considerations. Unless concrete \r\naction is taken now, places like Aleppo, Mosul and \r\nTripoli will soon cease to be human habitats.\r\n“In Africa, the protracted war in Somalia and \r\nthe armed conflict between political rivals in South \r\nSudan continue to blight the political landscape \r\nwith untold human suffering. To complicate an \r\nalready difficult situation, the impasse in Darfur \r\nand the frequent outbreaks of fighting in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and Burundi pose a serious threat \r\nto the civilian population, particularly women and \r\nchildren. I appeal to my brothers and sisters in \r\nthose African countries to eschew violence and \r\nembrace reconciliation. As leaders of our people, \r\nwe must always remember that history will judge \r\nus kindly only if we are magnanimous and devoted \r\nto the welfare and well-being of our people.\r\n“We cannot, of course, discuss international \r\npeace and security without addressing the lingering \r\nand unresolved Palestinian problem. The time has \r\ncome, and is indeed overdue, for Israel to heed the \r\noverwhelming international consensus for a two-\r\nState solution as the only viable option that can \r\nensure peaceful coexistence between Israel and \r\nPalestine.\r\n“The fragile peace that we enjoy is being \r\nseriously undermined by terrorism, which has \r\nassumed a global dimension, with the killing and \r\nmaiming of innocent people. Today, we remember \r\nwith sadness all the victims of terrorism who have \r\nbeen gunned down or maimed by bombs in Paris, \r\nBrussels, Bamako, Ouagadougou and Pakistan, \r\ninter alia, around the globe. It is therefore not \r\nan exaggeration to say that the world is in grave \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n10/30 16-29503\r\ndanger and that our human existence is under \r\nserious threat as a result. Collective action is the \r\nbest way to fight that global scourge.\r\n“We are also greatly concerned that certain \r\nrogue politicians and pseudo-intellectuals with \r\nnefarious intentions are using the terrorism card \r\nto revive and propagate the notion of a clash of \r\ncivilizations in which Islam is at war with the \r\nWest. Their incendiary rhetoric lambasting Islam is \r\nunacceptable and can serve only to further polarize \r\nthe world. The evil actions of a group of individuals \r\nclaiming adherence to Islam cannot be taken to \r\nrepresent the convictions of the majority. There is \r\nno clash between Islam and the other Abrahamic \r\nreligions of Christianity and Judaism, and there \r\nis certainly no war between Islam and the world. \r\nWe condemn the renegade forces of terrorism and \r\nreject their campaign to create a nexus between \r\nterrorism and Islam.\r\n“While we express anxiety over global \r\ninsecurity, we must also focus on global economic \r\nconditions. A world that is marked by disparities \r\nand divided into zones of the aff luent and the poor \r\ncannot enjoy durable peace and security. A world \r\nin which the conspicuous consumption of the few \r\novershadows the abject poverty of the majority can \r\nonly be a world of the powerful against the weak \r\nand of mutual animosity, mistrust and tensions. It \r\nis for those reasons and owing to our quest for a just \r\nand equitable world that we support the theme of \r\nthe current session of the General Assembly: ‘The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push \r\nto transform our world’.\r\n“Under the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nthe Islamic Republic of the Gambia registered \r\nsignificant progress in its development agenda. \r\nI am happy and proud to state that hunger has \r\nbeen eradicated in our country, and the level of \r\nundernourishment has decreased from 13 per \r\ncent to 3 per cent. Our ultimate aim is to make \r\nagriculture attractive and profitable through our \r\nback-to-the-land policy, so that our people can \r\nwork and live in dignity.\r\n“The future of Africa and indeed the world \r\nis inextricably linked to women as well as youth. \r\nUnfortunately, Africa is losing its young population \r\nbecause of migration. Our villages, towns and cities \r\nare being deserted as young people attempt to sail \r\nto what is wrongly perceived as the new El Dorado. \r\nThousands have perished at sea, while thousands \r\nmore are languishing in detention centres in \r\nEurope. That is an unprecedented depletion of our \r\nhuman resources and is bound to have disastrous \r\nconsequences if allowed to continue. Given that \r\ndisturbing phenomenon, international cooperation \r\nthat would create jobs for youth should no longer \r\nbe a slogan but a calculated strategy to keep them \r\nat home in gainful employment that could enhance \r\ntheir well-being and ensure the development of \r\ntheir countries.\r\n“The Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \r\nwhich the Islamic Republic of the Gambia signed \r\ntogether with the entire membership of the United \r\nNations, is a landmark in our human evolution. \r\nIt shows that, despite the imperfections of our \r\nOrganization and our ideological differences, we \r\nare without a doubt capable of forging a global \r\npartnership to deal with a common danger. \r\nThe negotiations were protracted and at times \r\nacrimonious, but in the end our common desire \r\nto save our planet prevailed. I wish to pay tribute \r\nto all the men and women who worked with \r\ndedication and sacrifice to ensure the success of \r\nthe negotiations.\r\n“Although the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange was a success, the magnitude and \r\ncomplexities of other challenges facing the world \r\nhave again brought into sharp focus the role of \r\nthe United Nations and its capacity to address \r\nand advance international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment. That brings to mind the repeated \r\ncalls of Member States for Security Council and \r\nbroader United Nations reforms in order to enable \r\nthe Organization to confront new and emerging \r\nchallenges. The current composition of the \r\nSecurity Council, with five permanent members \r\nholding the veto power, is undemocratic, and \r\nthe system is akin to minority rule. A situation \r\nin which five countries dictate the political and \r\neconomic agenda and landscape of the world and \r\ncan override international consensus by veto is \r\nindeed an anachronism.\r\n“Africa has the highest representation in the \r\nGeneral Assembly, yet that continent, with over \r\n1.2 billion people, has been denied the right to \r\na permanent seat on the Security Council. The \r\nIslamic Republic of the Gambia therefore once \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 11/30\r\nagain calls for the expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil to facilitate the allocation to Africa of two \r\npermanent seats with veto power and two other \r\nnon-permanent seats. \r\n“Africa’s legitimate demands have been \r\nwell documented and articulated in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration. A well-\r\nstructured and fully inclusive United Nations is \r\nwhat the world needs, and Africa is ready to take its \r\nrightful place and play a more pivotal and effective \r\nrole in world affairs. \r\n“The significance of the reforms being \r\nenvisaged calls for boldness and strong leadership. \r\nThat is why we attach great importance to the \r\nelection of the next Secretary-General. It is our \r\nhope that he or she will combine the legacies of \r\nhis or her predecessors with the qualities of vision, \r\nfair play and equity. We always expect the new \r\nSecretary-General to be the people’s Secretary-\r\nGeneral and not the servant of the powerful five \r\nalone. The Secretary-General must be the voice of \r\nthe voiceless and the chief advocate of the people of \r\nthe world. We therefore look to the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral to provide a visionary leadership that will \r\nsettle old problems and disputes in a new era of \r\npeace, progress and prosperity.\r\n“The failure to address and settle age-old \r\ninjustices is responsible for some of our major \r\nproblems in the world today. I am referring to \r\nthe historical injustices of slavery, the slave trade \r\nand colonialism. For far too long, slave-trading \r\nnations and colonialists have stubbornly defied \r\ngood conscience, which would compel them \r\nto acknowledge the evil nature of their actions \r\nand atone for the atrocities that were committed \r\nagainst Africans and people of African descent. \r\nThe African continent was plundered and pillaged, \r\nwhile millions of its inhabitants were trafficked to \r\nNorth America and the Caribbean. For centuries, \r\nthey were exploited as slave labour in plantations, \r\nfuelling the industries of the slave-owning \r\ncountries. Those acts of enslavement and forced \r\nlabour provide empirical evidence that the \r\neconomic foundation of the Western economies \r\nwas built by enslaved Africans.\r\n“There is also irrefutable evidence that, despite \r\ntheir providing free labour, African slaves suffered \r\ndiscrimination, exploitation, torture and death at \r\nthe hands of their ruthless owners. The effects of \r\nthe inhumane treatment that they suffered can be \r\ntraced in their offspring. Even today, the slavery \r\nsyndrome continues to impact and shape the lives \r\nand circumstances of Africans and people of \r\nAfrican descent. To us who are affected by that \r\nphenomenon, slavery is a painful legacy. Yet there \r\nare those who question the merits of reparations.\r\n“Although there have been pleas of innocence, \r\nthere have also been notable pleas of guilt, as well. \r\nIn 2006, for example, Tony Blair, the then British \r\nPrime Minister, apologized for his country’s role \r\nin the transatlantic slave trade. The Assembly will \r\nrecall that in 2007, Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of \r\nLondon at the time, acknowledged that the wealth \r\ngenerated from the slave trade was responsible for \r\nthe economic prosperity of England. But perhaps \r\nthe best illustration of guilt was the proposal in the \r\n1860s by General William Sherman of the United \r\nStates Army that every freed slave in the United \r\nStates should be given 40 acres and a mule as \r\ncompensation. Sadly, President Andrew Johnson \r\nand the United States Congress rejected the idea \r\nat the time.\r\n“That was the beginning of the resistance \r\nagainst reparations. Yet, over time, we have had \r\nseveral global reparations. America, Britain, \r\nGermany and Japan have seen the need for \r\nand prudence of paying reparations for crimes \r\ncommitted against other countries and peoples. \r\nGermany, for example, we all recall, paid $60 billion \r\nto survivors of the Holocaust, and the Jewish \r\nReparation Fund exists as well. The United States \r\npaid $20,000 each to 10,000 Japanese Americans \r\nwho were sent to internment camps. Similarly, the \r\nUnited States has compensated native tribes for \r\nbroken treaties. Japan has paid Second World War \r\nreparations to its former colonial possessions, such \r\nas Korea. It should also be noted that Britain has \r\npaid reparations to the Maoris of New Zealand for \r\ndamage done during colonial times. More recently, \r\nIraq has paid compensation to Kuwait for damages \r\nthat it caused during its invasion and occupation of \r\nthat country in 1990. \r\n“Why then should Africans and people of \r\nAfrican descent be ineligible for reparations, after \r\nsuffering the historic injustices of slavery, the \r\nslave trade and colonialism? Apart from historic \r\nprecedents, there is merit, of course, in the call for \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n12/30 16-29503\r\nreparations for damages caused during colonialism. \r\nMany of the problems confronting the former \r\ncolonies today are the direct consequences of the \r\nactions of the former colonial Powers. A vivid \r\nillustration of how colonizers destroyed Africa is \r\nthe way in which the continent was divided and \r\nshared out. The balkanization of Africa did not \r\nrespect the territorial integrity of countries; nor did \r\nit consider tribal boundaries, or trade groups for \r\nthat matter.\r\n“The division of Africa was arbitrary, taking \r\ninto account the best interests of the colonizers. As \r\na result, the geography of countries was altered. \r\nChildren and kin became separated, customs and \r\ntraditions destroyed and the most valuable artefacts \r\ncarted away to Western museums. Africa was indeed \r\ntorn apart, its people displaced and disintegrated, \r\nand the continent as a whole weakened forever. \r\nReparations are therefore justified because they \r\nwould demonstrate remorse and symbolize the \r\nhealing of the wounds of colonialism. Reparations \r\nwould also be an effective way to correct the global \r\neconomic imbalances caused by colonialism.\r\n“It is therefore with a deep sense of mission and \r\nmoral imperative that I ask the General Assembly \r\nto accept the case of slavery and colonialism as \r\na global issue that should be addressed without \r\nequivocation. The African Union has given the \r\nmatter its full support, and all well-meaning people \r\naround the world expect a favourable response from \r\nthe international community to such a legitimate \r\ncause in preparation for the discussions and \r\ndebates that would ensue. We recently concluded \r\nconsultations at an international colloquium on the \r\nsubject in Banjul, our capital, where a road map \r\nwas presented on the way forward. The Group of \r\nAfrican States at the United Nations is already \r\nworking on a draft resolution on slavery, the slave \r\ntrade, colonialism and reparations, to be introduced \r\nbefore the Assembly at this session. I appeal to all \r\nto support the adoption of that draft resolution and \r\nrestore the dignity of our African ancestors. \r\n“In conclusion, I encourage the Assembly \r\nto use this opportunity to once again address the \r\nburning issues of our time. The people of the world \r\nare in need of durable peace. We need inclusive \r\ndialogue to resolve our problems and differences \r\nand forge partnerships that will improve our \r\nhuman conditions. The security of our world can be \r\nassured only if we establish genuine and friendly \r\nrelations based on mutual respect for the dignity \r\nof our people and the sovereignty of our nations. I \r\nwish the Assembly a successful session.”\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President and \r\nMinister for Women’s Affairs of the Islamic Republic \r\nof the Gambia for the statement she has just made.\r\nMs. Isatou Njie Saidy, Vice-President and Minister \r\nfor Women’s Affairs of the Islamic Republic of the \r\nGambia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic \r\nof Ethiopia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nEthiopia, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Dessalegn (Ethiopia): At the outset, let me \r\ncongratulate the President on his assumption of his \r\nhigh office to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session. I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto assure him of our support in the effective discharge \r\nof his responsibilities. I would also like to express \r\nappreciation to his predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, who steered the work of the \r\nhistoric seventieth session.\r\nSince the Secretary-General has addressed the \r\nAssembly at its general debate for the last time, allow \r\nme to express, on behalf of the people and Government \r\nof Ethiopia and on my own behalf, sincere appreciation \r\nto Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his tireless service to our \r\nOrganization over the past decade. We cherish his \r\nfriendship with Ethiopia and with Africa as a whole, and \r\nwe wish him all the very best in his future endeavours.\r\nThe past year has indeed been historic in more ways \r\nthan one. It has been a time when we have reflected on \r\nour journey over the past 70 years and taken decisive \r\nsteps towards ensuring the peace and prosperity of \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 13/30\r\nour peoples and the protection of our environment. \r\nWe have seen what the United Nations can deliver as a \r\nunique intergovernmental platform for a common and \r\ncollective response to the myriad challenges facing \r\nhumankind as a whole. It has been testament to the fact \r\nthat we can indeed achieve concrete results, if we set \r\naside, or at least manage, our differences and act for the \r\ncommon good.\r\nNow is, of course, the time for action, so that \r\nthe transformative decisions that we took last year \r\nwill have real meaning in the lives of our people. \r\nWe recognize the small but encouraging steps taken \r\ntowards the implementation of our decisions in many \r\nof the domains. For our part, for instance, not only \r\nhave we integrated the Sustainable Development Goals \r\ninto our national development plans, but we have also \r\nembarked on implementing them. The ratification of \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change is also a major \r\npriority, and we will expedite the process as soon as our \r\nParliament opens its session at the end of this month.\r\nTo say that the world is currently confronting \r\nunprecedented challenges would be an understatement. \r\nWithout a doubt, there are enormous implications for \r\nthe implementation of the ambitious and transformative \r\nagendas that we set out last year. International peace \r\nand stability are facing greater risks with the rise of \r\ngeopolitical tensions and the growing threats posed by \r\nall shades of terrorist groups and other transnational \r\ncriminal networks. The world economy has not yet \r\ncome out of its crisis, and growing inequality is creating \r\na lot of frustration, paving the way for the resurgence \r\nof populism.\r\nWhile social media offer a digital platform to \r\nimprove the exchange of information and enhance \r\npopular participation, their attendant negative impacts \r\ncannot simply be ignored. In fact, we are seeing how \r\nmisinformation can easily go viral via social media \r\nand mislead many people, especially youth, who are \r\nour future. Social media have certainly empowered \r\npopulists and other extremists to exploit people’s \r\ngenuine concerns and spread their message of hate and \r\nbigotry without any inhibition.\r\nWe would be the first to admit that countries need \r\nto assume ownership of their problems. Externalizing \r\nthe sources of setbacks and seeking external causes for \r\none’s national shortcomings is an approach to problem-\r\nsolving whose results can only be pregnant with danger. \r\nBut it is vital to underline a critical matter that is usually \r\ngiven short shrift, both by the media and others. It is \r\nsimply hypocritical to deny that some countries have \r\nbeen the targets of destabilization activities carried \r\nout without accountability by people and groups that \r\nhave been given shelter by friendly States. The abuse \r\nof opportunities created by the social media and other \r\nmedia outlets financed by friendly Governments has \r\nbecome flagrant. It is just plain foolish to deny that \r\nsuch abuses have no implications for the respect of the \r\nhuman rights of our people or that such abuse does not \r\nundermine our capacity to ensure that we maintain a \r\nhigh standard in that respect.\r\nThe fragile nature of our environment has also \r\nbeen evident. The drought induced by the El Niño-\r\nSouthern Oscillation has affected the livelihood of \r\nmillions of people, including our own, all across the \r\nworld. The current drought is happening at a time when \r\nhumanitarian needs have become enormous because \r\nof other emergency situations. In addition, the large \r\nmovements of refugees and migrants have led to a \r\nmajor crisis. Such movements are a matter that we have \r\ndiscussed at length over the past few days.\r\nIt is in such challenging circumstances that we \r\nare striving to implement a transformational agenda. \r\nObviously, there are no easy solutions to the complex \r\nchallenges at hand. The situation is much more \r\npronounced for the least developed countries like us \r\nthat are making every possible effort to make a dent on \r\npoverty. We are trying to escape from the poverty trap \r\nand take our country on a path of sustainable growth, \r\nbut there are bound to be twists and turns in our efforts. \r\nThe successful development experiences of others have \r\nshown that such twists and turns are only natural. \r\nWhat we need is to have a policy space that allows \r\nus to make mistakes and learn from them. We believe \r\nthat our vision is right, and we are determined to get \r\nto our goal. Whatever challenges and shortcomings we \r\nmay have, we do not have an issue owning up to them, \r\nand we will make every possible effort to deal with our \r\nshortcomings with the close consultation, cooperation \r\nand participation of our people. There is no better \r\ntestimony of the resolve that we have in that regard than \r\nthe way in which we have handled the tragedies caused \r\nby the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.\r\nNevertheless, we know that we are not living in \r\nisolation, and we need a favourable external environment \r\nin order to realize our development aspirations. We \r\ncannot simply wish away the challenges that I have \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n14/30 16-29503\r\noutlined. They need the collective and coordinated \r\nresponses of all of us, and for our part we are always \r\nready and willing to continue to contribute positively in \r\nclose partnership with others in our region and beyond \r\nin tackling such challenges.\r\nIn that context, peace and security in the Horn of \r\nAfrica are extremely critical for us, and we are doing \r\neverything we can with others in the region to tackle \r\nthe conflicts aff licting our neighbours. We have been \r\nmaking tremendous efforts to assist South Sudan to \r\nresolve its internal problems. What happened in July \r\nwas indeed a serious setback for the implementation of \r\nthe peace agreement that the South Sudanese parties \r\nhad signed under the auspices of the Intergovernmental \r\nAuthority on Development (IGAD) Plus. We in the \r\nIGAD region met on a number of occasions at various \r\nlevels to address the issue and made concrete proposals \r\non the way forward. The proposals were subsequently \r\nsupported by the African Union and the United \r\nNations. We are confident and hopeful that the South \r\nSudanese parties will heed the call of the regional and \r\ninternational communities and restore peace for the \r\nsake of their people, who have suffered so much.\r\nIn addition, we have also been making efforts to \r\nfight terrorism in and pacify Somalia. In spite of the \r\nmany challenges that persist, Somalia has indeed come \r\na long way. The symbolic significance of the IGAD \r\nextraordinary summit held recently in Mogadishu \r\ncannot be overemphasized. Who would have thought \r\nthat this would be possible only a few years ago? \r\nSomalia has defied the odds. We hope that smooth \r\nelections in the coming months will consolidate the \r\ngains made in recent years and lay the foundation for \r\na peaceful and stable Somalia. The countries in the \r\nregion are ready to support and accompany the process \r\ntogether with the African Union, the United Nations \r\nand other international partners.\r\nEthiopia is indeed honoured to have been elected \r\nas a non-permanent member of the Security Council \r\nfor the 2017-2018 term. Let me take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our profound appreciation to all the Members \r\nof the United Nations for their support and confidence. \r\nI would like to conclude my remarks by \r\nreaffirming our commitment to effectively discharging \r\nour responsibilities and upholding the principles and \r\npurposes of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for the \r\nstatement he has just made. \r\nMr. Hailemariam Dessalegn, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum. \r\nAddress by Mr. Dacian Cioloș, Prime Minister \r\nof Romania \r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Romania.\r\nMr. Dacian Cioloș, Prime Minister of Romania, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Dacian Cioloș, Prime \r\nMinister of Romania, and inviting him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nMr. Cioloș (Romania) (spoke in French): More than \r\never, the world is confronting challenges that demand \r\nglobal solutions. Persistent, chronic conflicts, the \r\nscourge of terrorism, natural disasters, poverty, social \r\nexclusion and displaced populations are all challenges \r\nthat we must approach in a sustainable and globally \r\noriented manner.\r\nOur world is increasingly compelled to find \r\ninclusive solutions. We cannot enjoy peace and security \r\nwithout development. The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) provide us with a new opportunity and \r\na universal impetus to transform the world. The SDGs \r\nset an ambitious programme of action for the years to \r\ncome, aimed at eradicating extreme poverty, fighting \r\nfor peace and security, combating inequality and \r\nprotecting the planet. \r\nWe need to integrate the various strategies relating \r\nto climate change, development, humanitarian aid, \r\nthe eradication of hunger, economic growth and \r\npeacebuilding. The political direction that we have set \r\nout for our social, industrial and agricultural policies \r\nwill have an impact in one way or another on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The experiences of the past show us that \r\nusing purely isolated, sectorial policies will create more \r\nproblems than solutions. \r\nIn Romania, we have launched the process of \r\ntransforming the SDGs into national policies. We \r\nare concentrating on taking on environmental and \r\nclimate-change issues in sector-specific policies, while \r\nalso developing a comprehensive approach. We want to \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 15/30\r\nensure the transition to a circular and green economy \r\nby specifically focusing on the good governance of \r\nnatural resources and naturally protected areas, which \r\ncover 25 per cent of our territory. \r\nThe implementation of the SDGs and the transition \r\nto a green economy provide the only means of \r\nensuring a sustainable, inclusive and decent life for \r\nour citizens. We believe that a cross-cutting approach \r\nto energy, environmental and agricultural policies, as \r\nwell as climate issues, is essential in order to achieve \r\nthe SDGs. For example, in the area of housing and \r\nenergy efficiency, we recently adopted a programme to \r\npromote green technologies and materials. This year, \r\nwe also adopted a national anti-poverty package that \r\nincludes specific measures to fight social exclusion and \r\nhelp vulnerable children. \r\nDevelopment will become unsustainable if it is not \r\ninclusive in terms of both content and implementation. \r\nThat is why we have invested significantly in open \r\ngovernance tools involving civil society and the \r\nbusiness world.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nEvents in South-East Europe over the past two years \r\nhave served to highlight complex security challenges \r\nin the vicinity of my country and are, without any \r\ndoubt, responsible for the reversals in our progress \r\ntowards sustainable development. The belt of frozen \r\nconflict zones around the Black Sea remains a serious, \r\npermanent threat to stability in the region and beyond. \r\nProsperity and respect for the principles and norms of \r\ninternational law have been put on hold. We are deeply \r\ntroubled by the use of hybrid warfare tactics and the \r\nillegal annexation of territories.\r\nThe growing instability in the Middle East, \r\nwith Syria as the epicentre, is a major source of \r\nproliferating terrorism and massive migration. It is a \r\nthreat not only to the region but to the entire world, \r\nand it must be addressed resolutely. We need to \r\nencourage reconciliation in the countries affected by \r\ninstability by establishing policies aimed at promoting \r\nbridges between communities, while ensuring proper \r\nrepresentation and inclusiveness. We must focus \r\nincreased attention on post-conflict reconstruction \r\nstrategies based on the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand their Targets for Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen and \r\ncontinue discussions with all the stakeholders involved \r\non the necessary institutional process and financial \r\ncontributions. \r\nRomania is convinced that resolving the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict is one of the most important tasks \r\nfacing us; it could signal a turning point on the road \r\nback to stabilization and respect for fundamental rights, \r\nmutual acceptance and prosperity.\r\nMy country remains committed to the United \r\nNations effort to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity. Romania has long been a contributor to United \r\nNations peacekeeping. At present, Romanian military \r\nand police forces are taking part in ten United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations and two special political \r\nmissions.\r\nPeace and security cannot be sustained if the \r\npotential threat of the proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction persists, particularly nuclear weapons. \r\nRomania is currently chairing the Preparatory \r\nCommission for the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty Organization and has been clear in its \r\ncondemnation of the nuclear and ballistic tests carried \r\nout by the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea this \r\nyear.\r\nI would also like to underline the importance of \r\nrethinking the relationship between humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment policies as an opportunity to find new \r\nsolutions and responses. It is our responsibility to \r\nbuild on existing regional experiences and initiatives, \r\nsome of which have emerged in the follow-up process \r\nto the Istanbul Humanitarian Summit. We need to \r\nmove beyond sectoral approaches in trade policy; \r\naddress climate change, hunger and poverty; ensure \r\nfood production and economic growth; and find a \r\nmore inclusive institutional framework to put forward \r\nintegrated solutions. Romania is stepping up its effort to \r\nrespond to those challenges in the spirit of international \r\nsolidarity and responsibility-sharing and in accordance \r\nwith our legal and moral obligations. Let me make three \r\nbrief points to highlight our main lines of action.\r\nFirst, as an emerging donor and a country of \r\nresettlement, Romania has been working to expand \r\nits contribution to international humanitarian actions \r\nin recent years by increasing its resettlement capacity \r\nand financial assistance. Secondly, Romania continues \r\nto advocate for strengthening respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law and constructive engagement in \r\ndebates on possible ways to improve compliance. \r\nThirdly, in its capacity as President of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Convention against \r\nTransnational Organized Crime for the seventh session, \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n16/30 16-29503\r\nRomania encourages greater accountability with regard \r\nto the implementation of the Convention’s provisions \r\non human trafficking and the smuggling of migrants, \r\namong other areas.\r\nMr. El Haycen (Mauritania), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nOutrageous terrorist attacks have shocked the \r\nworld this year, reminding us time and again that \r\ninternational terrorism undermines peace and security \r\nwherever it occurs. We cannot let terrorists take hold. \r\nTerrorist groups cannot be countered through military \r\nactions alone; we must also address the ability of such \r\ngroups to attract recruits, particularly young people. \r\nWe must eliminate the root causes that have allowed \r\nsuch groups to develop in the first place. Preventing \r\nradicalization is key, with action targeted on the \r\nunderlying socioeconomic conditions of communities \r\nwhere individuals are most vulnerable to radicalization \r\nand recruitment. We need more effective communication \r\nand education tools.\r\nI commend the considerable progress achieved over \r\nthe past few months in the fight against Da’esh in Libya, \r\nIraq and Syria. It is of the utmost urgency to deny them \r\nsafe haven in other areas and by every means possible \r\nto stop the f lows of foreign fighters from joining them. \r\nBut that is only the first step. The liberated areas need \r\nreconstruction and stabilization.\r\nFor some time now, Romania has been promoting the \r\nidea that the response to terrorism requires multilateral \r\naction, based on international law. That is why Romania \r\nand Spain have suggested the establishment of an \r\ninternational court for acts of terrorism as a means \r\nof ensuring accountability for the horrific crimes we \r\ncontinue to witness.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to express my \r\nappreciation for the outstanding contribution made \r\nby the Secretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, and for the active role he has played in \r\nstrengthening the position of the United Nations in the \r\ninternational arena and promoting peace, stability and \r\nsustainable development. His leadership at the helm of \r\nthe Organization has been an inspiration to numerous \r\npeople around the world.\r\nMy country is committed to continuing to devote \r\nsubstantial political, diplomatic, human and financial \r\nresources to regional and global stability, in support of \r\nUnited Nations efforts in the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity. That is why Romania has announced its bid \r\nfor a seat as a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil for the 2020-2021 term. I strongly believe that \r\nRomania’s experience and solid track record in building \r\nbridges and trust among all Member States will make \r\na valuable contribution to the Security Council’s work.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Romania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Dacian Cioloș, Prime Minister of Romania, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of \r\nthe People’s Republic of Bangladesh\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Sheikh \r\nHasina, Prime Minister of the People’s Republic of \r\nBangladesh, and inviting her to address the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nSheikh Hasina (Bangladesh) (spoke in Bangla; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure to congratulate Mr. Thomson on his \r\nelection as President of General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. I commend the exemplary manner of his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, who presided over \r\nthe Assembly last year.\r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon marks the \r\ncompletion of his tenure this year. I recall our many \r\nmeetings and conversations on a host of important \r\nissues. Always a true and trusted friend, he recognized \r\nBangladesh’s development gains as a model for the \r\nrest of the world. I wish him and Mrs. Ban continued \r\nsuccess and good health.\r\nBangladesh’s Father of the Nation, Bangabandhu \r\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman, standing before the General \r\nAssembly in 1974, stated: \r\n“Our total commitment to peace is born of the \r\nrealization that only an environment of peace \r\nwould enable us to ... mobilize and concentrate \r\nall our energies and resources in combating the \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 17/30\r\nscourges of poverty, hunger, disease, illiteracy and \r\nunemployment.” (A/PV.2243, para. 12)\r\nOur world is now at a juncture where the end of \r\nthose scourges is in sight. There are many creative and \r\npractical solutions in our hands. The amazing power of \r\ntechnology, ideas and global citizens help us to imagine \r\na brave new world. Yet our world is not free from tension \r\nand fear. Violent conflicts continue to rage in several \r\nplaces, with a heavy toll on human lives. Those f leeing \r\nfrom the conflicts are often denied protection across \r\nborders. Dire humanitarian needs are at times ignored \r\nand access to those in need is blocked. What was the \r\ncrime of Aylan Kurdi, the innocent 3-year-old Syrian \r\nboy who drowned at sea? What was the fault of 5-year-\r\nold Omran Daqneesh, who was seriously wounded in \r\nhis hometown of Aleppo by an air strike? As a mother, \r\nit is indeed hard to understand those cruelties. Will our \r\nglobal conscience not be stirred by such events?\r\nWe have just concluded the historic summit for \r\nrefugees and migrants. The outcome of the summit \r\nshould help redefine perceptions and realities of human \r\nmobility in our time. Migrants and refugees must \r\nbe seen as potential agents for change both in their \r\nplaces of origin and destination. Bangladesh offers to \r\nco-facilitate the work of the global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration. We look forward to a \r\nconstructive dialogue on all related issues at the Global \r\nForum on Migration and Development, which we will \r\nhost in December.\r\nIn 2015, we adopted a transformative development \r\nagenda with a set of Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs). The political will behind the agenda needs to \r\nbe translated into concrete and meaningful support for \r\ncountries that are lagging behind. In order to catch up, \r\nthe developing world needs access to transformative \r\ntechnologies. The internationally agreed development \r\ncommitments for the least developed countries (LDCs) \r\nmust be fulfilled in order to pave the way for their \r\ngraduation. The Technology Bank for the LDCs should \r\nbe geared to promoting innovation and predictable \r\nresource f lows.\r\nIn Bangladesh, we have already mainstreamed \r\nmost of the SDGs into our national development plans. \r\nA platform under the supervision of the Prime Minister \r\nhas been created to coordinate and monitor the work. \r\nConsultations are now ongoing with local government, \r\ncivil society, media and academia. They are being \r\ncarried out in tandem with our Vision 2021 and Vision \r\n2041 policies, which seek to realize Bangabandhu \r\nSheikh Mujibur Rahman’s dream of building a “Sonar”, \r\nor Golden Bangladesh, that is free from hunger, poverty, \r\nilliteracy and exploitation.\r\nOur aim is to build an inclusive, empowered, \r\ndigital and knowledge-based society. My Government \r\nis focusing on innovative public service delivery, mass \r\naccess to information, and enhanced transparency and \r\naccountability. We have set up about 10,000 digital \r\ncentres across the country in order to deliver 200 \r\ndifferent services to people’s doorsteps. Health services \r\nthrough mobile phones and a 24-hour web portal are \r\ncomplementing the work of 16,438 community and \r\nlocal health clinics. Digital laboratories and multimedia \r\nclassrooms are operating in a growing number of \r\neducational institutions.\r\nThe growing web of physical and virtual \r\nconnectivity is creating new opportunities for our \r\npeople. As a key enabler of economic development, \r\nbroadband connectivity should be available to every \r\ncitizen of the world. I invite world leaders and other \r\ninternational partners to join hands in making this \r\npossible. Our Government is committed to providing \r\na voice and data connection to every citizen by 2021.\r\nBangladesh’s strategic location makes it an emerging \r\nhub for regional connectivity, foreign investment and \r\nglobal outsourcing. We have embarked on large-scale \r\ninfrastructure projects to match our development \r\naspirations. Multimodal transport networks are being \r\nbuilt to promote trade and people-to-people contacts \r\namong Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal.\r\nThe work of the 6.15 kilometre-long Padma \r\nMultipurpose Bridge was commissioned with our own \r\nresources. Discussions are under way to build a deep \r\nseaport, while our third seaport in Paira has commenced \r\noperations. Work on the metro rail in our capital, Dhaka, \r\nis also under way. One hundred economic zones are \r\nbeing developed across the country to allow potential \r\ninvestors to invest in Bangladesh.\r\nSuch forward-looking thrusts in our progress \r\nare supported by the impressive performance of our \r\nmacroeconomic and socioeconomic indicators. In the \r\nfiscal period 2015-2016, our economy posted a gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP) growth rate of over 7 per cent. \r\nBangladesh has experienced one of the fastest poverty \r\nreduction rates in countries with a modest resource base. \r\nWe have brought poverty down from 56.7 per cent in \r\n1991 to 22.4 per cent today. We have already gone from \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n18/30 16-29503\r\nthe low to the medium category in the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme’s Human Development \r\nReport and have reached the World Bank’s lower-\r\nmiddle income status. Over the past seven years, despite \r\nthe global recession, our export earnings more than \r\ntripled to reach $34.24 billion, remittance f lows have \r\nincreased nearly threefold, and our foreign currency \r\nreserves have multiplied 8.5 times, from $3.5 billion \r\nto over $31 billion. During the same period, power-\r\ngeneration capacity almost tripled, as did foreign direct \r\ninvestment. A key to our development strategy is our \r\nfocus on addressing inequality through social security, \r\ndecent work and financial inclusion. We allocate over \r\n13 per cent of our budget to social-safety-net spending, \r\nwhich is 2.3 per cent of our GDP.\r\nClimate change threatens many of our development \r\ngains. The landmark Paris Climate Agreement \r\nrecognizes the importance of adaptation, loss, damage \r\nand climate justice. Bangladesh has ratified the \r\nAgreement, and we hope that the large carbon-emitting \r\ncountries will ratify it soon.\r\nWe must join ranks to preserve our natural resources \r\nfor succeeding generations. Bangladesh reaffirms the \r\nneed for the conservation and sustainable use of marine \r\nresources so as to tap the potential of a blue economy.\r\nThe life-sustaining force of water is a finite \r\nresource. We have a shared responsibility to ensure the \r\njudicious and equitable use of our common waters. We \r\nmust stand by our pledge to provide clean drinking water \r\nand sanitation for all. I shall continue to champion these \r\nissues as a member of the High-level Panel on Water.\r\nI firmly believe that without women’s participation, \r\nsustainable development will simply not be tenable. \r\nA host of measures, including the promotion of \r\ngirls’ education, undertaken half a decade ago have \r\nstarted to yield dividends. Women in Bangladesh are \r\nnow increasingly becoming an integral part of our \r\ndevelopment endeavours. Around 3.5 million women \r\nare now working in the garment industry, a leading \r\nexport earning sector. The percentage of women in all \r\nprofessions is rapidly rising. Bangladesh is perhaps the \r\nonly country in the world today where women hold \r\nthe posts of Prime Minister and Leader of the House, \r\nLeader of the Opposition, Speaker and Deputy Leader \r\nof the House. Presently, we have 70 women members of \r\nParliament, constituting 20 per cent of the House. More \r\nthan 12,500 elected women representatives are serving \r\nin local government bodies.\r\nLast year, I mentioned terrorism and violent \r\nextremism as one of the two major global challenges \r\nof our time (see A/70/PV.19). We see these menaces \r\nsweeping across borders. No country seems immune, \r\nno individual beyond their reach. Terrorists are now \r\noften killing many innocent people everywhere, from \r\nthe United States of America to Europe, and from \r\nAfrica to Asia.\r\nWe believe that terrorists have no religion, caste \r\nor creed. We must unite in our resolve to defeat and \r\ndegrade them in all their forms and manifestations. We \r\nhave to identify the root causes of terrorism and violent \r\nextremism. At the same time, we have to identify the \r\nmentors, masterminds, abettors, financiers, arms \r\nsuppliers and trainers of these terrorists and extremists, \r\nand we must take strong action against them.\r\nAs a victim of terrorist attacks myself, I have \r\na zero-tolerance approach to terrorism and violent \r\nextremism. Our Government has succeeded in \r\ndismantling homegrown terrorist groups, plugging \r\ntheir regular financing pipelines and f lushing out their \r\nregional operatives from our territory. With the vicious \r\nrise of certain international terrorist entities, it appears \r\nthat some local fringe elements have drawn inspiration \r\nand managed to regroup and rebrand themselves.\r\nBangladesh, a unique country of religious \r\nharmony, experienced a grisly attack on 1 July 2016, \r\nwhen homegrown terrorists killed 20 people at a \r\nDhaka restaurant. We were able to rescue 13 hostages \r\nunharmed, but that horrific incident left a deep scar on \r\nthe hearts of the people of Bangladesh.\r\nWe are now battling this new wave of terrorism. \r\nWe have undertaken massive programmes to awaken \r\npeople and warn them against radicalization and to \r\nstand against militancy and extremism. The whole-of-\r\nsociety response I called for has been unprecedented. \r\nI am confident that with our people’s resilience and \r\nsupport, we will ensure that terrorists have absolutely \r\nno place on our soil.\r\nI would also like to urge the world community to \r\nwork globally to dry up the sources of funds, arms and \r\nammunition as well as moral and material support for \r\nmilitants and terrorists.\r\nBangladesh will carry on promoting the culture \r\nof peace that is at the heart of the agenda of the \r\nUnited Nations. We shall uphold our contribution to \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding. Our decision to set up \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 19/30\r\na peacebuilding centre in Dhaka will allow us to share \r\nour experience with other countries that are emerging \r\nfrom conflict.\r\nLikewise, we will remain vocal about recognizing \r\nthe role of national judicial processes in ensuring \r\naccountability and justice for mass atrocities. We have \r\nmoved past decades of impunity to ensure the trial of \r\nthe local perpetrators of genocide and crimes against \r\nhumanity during our liberation war, in 1971.\r\nThe recent efforts to relaunch the Middle East \r\npeace process and end the hostilities against the \r\nbrotherly Palestinian people must be pursued, in the \r\nright direction.\r\nIn our globalized world, there are challenges. But \r\nthere are also potential opportunities and benefits for \r\nall, but only if we know how to manage the process \r\nproperly. We are all gathered here to serve our one \r\nhumanity. Let us work through our differences and \r\nfind common ground to make the pragmatic changes \r\nwe wish to see in the world around us. The United \r\nNations provides us with a unique platform to do so. \r\nLet us renew our resolve to create an Organization of \r\nenduring relevance.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the People’s Republic of Bangladesh for the \r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nSheikh Hasina, Prime Minister of the People’s \r\nRepublic of Bangladesh, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Giorgi Kvirikashvili, Prime \r\nMinister of Georgia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Georgia.\r\nMr. Giorgi Kvirikashvili, Prime Minister of \r\nGeorgia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Giorgi \r\nKvirikashvili, Prime Minister of Georgia, and inviting \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Kvirikashvili (Georgia): It is my honour to \r\naddress the General Assembly. Georgia has promoted \r\nthe values of the United Nations since regaining its \r\nindependence 25 years ago. In return, the United \r\nNations has served as a partner for us — one of the \r\noldest nations in the world — in developing a free and \r\ndemocratic State. \r\nTwenty-five years ago, few of us could have imagined \r\nthat today Georgia would have transformed itself from \r\na country ravaged by civil war into a dynamic European \r\ndemocracy. We have made great progress in building \r\nstrong and effective State institutions; ensuring the \r\nfreedom of civil society, the media and markets; and on \r\nsocial cohesion and the rule of law. And we are proud \r\nto be ranked as the fifth-freest economy in the world, \r\nthus ensuring openness and integration into the global \r\nmarket and equal opportunities for all people interested \r\nin doing business in Georgia.\r\nSince July, Georgia has been an associated country \r\nof the European Union and is harmonizing its policies, \r\ninstitutions, sectors and market rules with those of the \r\nEuropean Union. We are an aspirant country to NATO, \r\nhaving the deepest and most comprehensive partnership \r\nwith that organization of any nation. In the past few \r\nweeks, the United States Government, the European \r\nUnion and NATO all took actions to emphasize \r\nthat Georgia’s future lies within the European and \r\nEuro-Atlantic community.\r\nAt its core, Georgia’s foreign policy is aimed at \r\nbuilding strong, mutually beneficial partnerships \r\nwith the countries of our region and beyond. This \r\npath, chosen by our people, leads to more stability, \r\nsecurity, peace and prosperity in our country and the \r\nregion. The work never ends, however. Today, we are \r\npoised to thrive in a new millennium. We are building \r\nan innovation-driven community with all generations \r\nlooking to embark upon an ever-brighter future. We \r\nare building a country that will ensure the unification \r\nof war-torn communities and abolish the Glienicke \r\nBridge, versions of which still exist in the twenty-first \r\ncentury owing to the ongoing occupation of two of our \r\nregions, dividing peaceful societies on both sides.\r\nA year ago we unanimously adopted a universal \r\nplan to better the world by setting 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) for the 2030 Agenda. \r\nThe much-needed transformative agenda for 2030 \r\nis indeed impressive. But let us be frank: despite the \r\nphenomenal blueprint of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, we as an international community could not live \r\nup to the challenge. I welcome this year’s focus on the \r\ntransformative power of the SDGs. Let us make sure \r\nthat in the next 15 years we do our utmost to really \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n20/30 16-29503\r\nfulfil, if not all, at least a good majority of the 17 Goals. \r\nTo do so, we need to succeed nationally and, at the same \r\ntime, support others in meeting their national goals. \r\nWe also must remember how interrelated the Goals are. \r\nWe have to strive for peace and security by fostering \r\ndevelopment, and vice versa.\r\nOur Government has a vision on how to translate \r\nthe Goals into national actions. This year, we launched \r\na comprehensive four-point reform plan, which is about \r\nmaking the development of our country a success \r\nfor each and every citizen of Georgia and for the \r\ndevelopment and stability of the region. \r\nEffective governance with transparent and \r\naccountable institutions is the key to building peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies and promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Focusing on SDG 16, we have made \r\na clean break with the past by prioritizing good \r\ngovernance. Two days ago, together with Estonia, the \r\nRepublic of Korea and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, my country organized a special high-level \r\ncross-regional event aimed at sharing success stories on \r\nimplementing SDG 16. Let me reiterate that we remain \r\ncommitted to sharing our experience and extending \r\nsupport to those who are pursuing transformation. \r\nWithin Georgia, our goal is to ensure maximum \r\ninclusion of all stakeholders in the decision-making \r\nprocess. We have created several platforms for \r\nengaging in regular dialogue with civil society and \r\nprivate-sector representatives. In promoting good \r\ngovernance, our aim is to make all public services even \r\nmore accessible for business, and we have launched an \r\nambitious project known as the Tbilisi Business House \r\nin our capital. With its online platform, it will serve as \r\na one-stop shop for businesses and as a front office for \r\nall Government bodies.\r\nCentral to good governance is fair and efficient \r\ntax collection. Georgia already has one of the lowest \r\ntax burdens in the world, but it is liberalizing its tax \r\nscheme further. To encourage business to invest in \r\ndevelopment, and therefore in new jobs, we have taken \r\nthe decision to abolish a profit tax on undistributed \r\nearnings. Although it is a costly reform, it ensures the \r\nlong-term sustainability of businesses and jobs. We \r\nare also improving the tax administration system by \r\nstrengthening the role of the judiciary in decisions on \r\ntax inspections, thereby ensuring increased protection \r\nfor the private sector.\r\nThe trend lines for Georgia continue to improve. \r\nThe World Bank has just reported that Georgia’s \r\npoverty rate dropped by more than 10 per cent in the \r\nperiod 2012-2014. That is a major accomplishment. In \r\n2015, the unemployment rate continued to decline and is \r\nnow at its lowest level in the past 12 years. Salaries and \r\nwages are up substantially, as compared with several \r\nyears ago. Georgia’s economy is growing despite the \r\ndownturns all around us, and foreign direct investment \r\nis approximately 100 per cent higher than in 2012. That \r\ntranslates directly into jobs for Georgians. Georgia now \r\nranks fourth in terms of the ease of doing business in \r\nEurope and Central Asia and is on the path to becoming \r\na true start-up nation.\r\nIn the history of Georgia since its independence, \r\nthere have never been so many opportunities for hard-\r\nworking people to launch or grow their own businesses. \r\nThose with an entrepreneurial spirit have more chances \r\nto succeed than ever. We have launched several projects \r\nthat ensure access to capital and infrastructure for \r\npeople with innovative ideas, especially those interested \r\nin manufacturing or farming in Georgia.\r\nThe secret to fulfilling the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and building resilient and inclusive communities \r\nlies in unlocking the hidden resource that every nation \r\nhas: its people. Accordingly, education is among our \r\ntop priorities. We decided to tailor our education \r\nsystem to ensure that it delivers for each individual \r\nand for our society and economy as a whole. We want \r\nevery graduate of a professional or higher-education \r\ninstitution financed by the Government to be able to \r\nfind his or her place in a competitive labour market. \r\nWe want an education system that is competitive and \r\ndelivers quality education not only to Georgian citizens, \r\nbut also to foreign students. The construction of two \r\nnew private technical universities, at an estimated \r\ndevelopment cost of €1 billion, started this year. We \r\nwill soon be able to offer some of the best education \r\nopportunities in our region.\r\nA healthy population is also key to further growth \r\nand development. Several years ago, we launched a \r\nf lagship programme for universal health care. Today, all \r\ncitizens of Georgia have heath-care insurance, thereby \r\nensuring that medical care is a reality for hundreds of \r\nthousands of our citizens for the first time. We have \r\nalso encouraged private investment in the health-care \r\nsystem, which has resulted in hundreds of millions of \r\ndollars being invested in new private hospitals. A new \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 21/30\r\nnational e-pharmacy system, which will streamline the \r\ndelivery of medicines to patients, is now being tested.\r\nWith the help of our partners, special programmes \r\nto eradicate persistent diseases have been started. \r\nGeorgia is poised to become one of the first countries \r\nto eliminate hepatitis C. We are especially grateful to \r\nthe United States for its help with this initiative.\r\nGeorgia’s development agenda is first and foremost \r\nabout our citizens and their equal rights. We believe in \r\nthe power of free citizens and the role of Government \r\nin ensuring freedoms and opportunities for them. \r\nSustainable development is not possible without human \r\nrights, access to justice and effective, transparent, \r\naccountable and inclusive institutions.\r\nWe have taken major steps to bolster the rule of \r\nlaw. We overhauled the court system, the Office of the \r\nProsecutor, judicial ethics and the responsibilities of \r\nattorneys. We gave more rights to defendants, and we \r\nended impunity for Government officials. All Georgians \r\nare now equal before the law and can benefit from a \r\njudiciary system that has gone through several waves \r\nof reforms to reach higher levels of independence and \r\nprofessionalism. We are continuing the reform process \r\nof the judiciary to achieve the highest international \r\nstandards. Today, Georgia ranks twenty-ninth on the \r\nRule of Law Index of the World Justice Project, ahead \r\nof a number of old and new European Union members.\r\nOther important steps address a regrettable problem \r\nwe inherited, that is, past human rights violations, with \r\nparticularly egregious infractions in our prisons. We \r\nhave acted swiftly and decisively to correct this. The \r\nUnited Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other \r\ncruel, inhuman and degrading treatment or punishment \r\nrecently observed that the Georgian Government had \r\nturned this problem around since its election in 2012. \r\nThe changes, he notes, are visible and quantifiable. \r\nWe did this by putting in place legal and procedural \r\nmechanisms for combating the mistreatment of \r\nprisoners, including compensation for victims. We \r\nhave enacted new anti-discrimination legislation. We \r\nhave worked hard to achieve results in the areas of \r\ngender equality and women’s empowerment. We are \r\nimplementing a national action plan to ensure equal \r\nopportunities for persons with disabilities. But there \r\nis still more to be done. For that purpose, we have set \r\nin place a new long-term comprehensive human rights \r\nstrategy and action plan.\r\nIn less than three weeks, we will be holding \r\nparliamentary elections in Georgia. Campaigning \r\nstarted more than three months ago, and this period \r\nhas shown evidence of Georgia’s real democratic \r\ndevelopment. With free and pluralistic media and \r\npolitical environments, a strong and vocal civil society \r\nand the relevant legislative and institutional framework, \r\nwe are ensuring a free, fair and transparent election \r\nprocess. On 8 October, the people of Georgia will be \r\nthe winners, and our democracy will continue driving \r\nour country to a sustainable future.\r\nSustainable development cannot be fully realized \r\nif it is divorced from the overriding issue of security. \r\nIn Georgia, we are reminded of this every day by a \r\nharsh reality, namely, that 20 per cent of our country is \r\noccupied by foreign troops, territory that they took by \r\nforce. Hundreds of thousands of people continue to be \r\ndenied the right to return to their homes. \r\nWe are grateful for the support offered by resolution \r\n70/265, on the status of internally displaced persons and \r\nrefugees from Abkhazia, Georgia, and the Tskhinvali \r\nregion/South Ossetia, Georgia. It is time to translate \r\nthis measure of support into action. Barbed wire fences \r\ninstalled by the occupiers divide Georgian families and \r\ncommunities. The populations in the occupied regions \r\nendure consistent ethnic discrimination and gross \r\nhuman rights violations. Their freedom of movement \r\nand their property rights are restricted. They are even \r\ndenied education in their native languages. I condemn \r\nthe recent act of holding elections for the Russian \r\nState Duma in Georgia’s occupied territories, which is \r\nanother part of Moscow’s annexation policy. This all \r\nhappens in the absence of any international monitoring, \r\nexcept for the limited involvement of the European \r\nUnion Monitoring Mission, which has been denied \r\naccess to the occupied territories.\r\nThe ongoing occupation and steps towards \r\nannexation remain the greatest existential challenge \r\ninherited by our Government. We have been seeking \r\na workable solution with the Russian Federation. \r\nWe have made some real progress in de-escalating \r\ntensions, but not all of Georgia’s steps forward have \r\nbeen reciprocated. The Russian Federation has yet to \r\nhonour even the European Union-mediated ceasefire \r\nagreement of August 2008.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, I would like to once again \r\nreaffirm that this conflict must be resolved peacefully, \r\nbased on full respect for Georgia’s sovereignty \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n22/30 16-29503\r\nand territorial integrity, within its internationally \r\nrecognized borders. We will continue to address \r\nthe concerns of people living in the Abkhazia and \r\nTskhinvali regions and to reconcile the war-torn \r\ncommunities across the occupation line. To that end, \r\nwe will make all the benefits of our European agenda \r\nand all economic opportunities available to the people \r\nresiding in the occupied territories. Our investment in \r\nthe prosperous future of a united Georgia is additional \r\nstimulus for building confidence and reconciliation.\r\nWe will invest more than $5 billion in connectivity \r\nand infrastructure in the next four years. We will \r\nconnect regions of Georgia with each other, as well \r\nas connect Georgia with the wider region. Thanks \r\nto Georgia’s strategic location, our ports, roads and \r\ntransport networks will be an important part of the \r\nambitious and transformative Silk Road Development \r\nPlan connecting Europe to Asia. We are investing not \r\nonly in infrastructure, but in policy platforms as well.\r\nThe Tbilisi Silk Road forum has proved to be a major \r\nsuccess, attracting the involvement of 35 countries. In \r\nparticular, we are honoured and excited to be working \r\nwith China and the other nations of the Silk Road to \r\nprovide a critical piece of a new trade and investment \r\ncorridor that will benefit the entire world.\r\nWhen we talk about connectivity, we must not \r\nomit the Internet, perhaps the greatest driver of global \r\ncooperation. Therefore, we have started the development \r\nof a country-wide broadband system that will bring \r\nthe benefits of the Internet to the most remote villages \r\nand farms. Georgia is proud to be listed among the top \r\ncountries in Internet freedom.\r\nI am proud to be speaking to the Assembly on \r\nbehalf of Georgia at a time when we are on the rise and \r\nat the centre of new developments connecting East and \r\nWest. It is in this spirit that we seek to create a more \r\nsecure and prosperous region, grounded in principles \r\nof sustainable development. We are working hard every \r\nday to take real actions that enhance the lives of our \r\npeople while respecting their rights, their beliefs and \r\ntheir cultures. We look forward to continuing to work \r\nwith the United Nations on achieving a shared vision \r\nfor a better future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Georgia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Giorgi Kvirikashvili, Prime Minister of \r\nGeorgia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Malcolm Turnbull, Prime \r\nMinister of the Commonwealth of Australia \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Commonwealth of Australia. \r\nMr. Malcolm Turnbull, Prime Minister of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Malcolm \r\nTurnbull, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth of \r\nAustralia, and inviting him to address the Assembly. \r\nMr. Turnbull (Australia): The tenor of our times \r\nis change — accelerating at a pace and on a scale \r\nunprecedented in all of human history. In less than a \r\ngeneration, billions have been lifted out of poverty, \r\nand billions more have been enabled to connect to each \r\nother and to a world of knowledge and ideas in a manner \r\nbarely imaginable a generation ago. Economic freedom \r\nbetween markets and within them, supercharged by the \r\nInternet, innovation and technology, has made possible \r\nthe longest run of economic progress in the history of \r\nthe world.\r\nThere are threats. At the meeting of the Group \r\nof Twenty we focused on how to resist the rising tide \r\nof protectionism, which is not a ladder to escape the \r\nlow-growth trap, but a shovel to dig it deeper. But most \r\nimportant of all is the threat of conflict and instability. \r\nWhere there is peace and the rule of law applies to both \r\ngovernors and governed, to both large States and small, \r\nwe have seen remarkable strides in every measure of \r\nhuman progress. But in too many places there is no \r\npeace — wars that seem to have no end, intractable \r\ndisorder that, in a connected world where technology \r\nhas trumped geography, affects us all.\r\nAnd yet despite setbacks to secure lasting peace, \r\nnotably in Syria, over the past five years the United \r\nNations system has produced a global Arms Trade \r\nTreaty, a pivotal global agreement on climate change, \r\na transformational set of Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and a global blueprint for disaster-risk reduction. \r\nThese successes add to the less high-profile, but \r\nhugely important work of the United Nations in the \r\nfield — whether it be vaccinating children, helping \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 23/30\r\nsubsistence farmers to improve their crop yields, \r\nfacilitating democratic elections or delivering \r\nemergency humanitarian support. They demonstrate \r\nthe approach we need to take as we face the challenges \r\nof the future.\r\nWe need strength to respond firmly and decisively \r\nin the face of tyranny and abuse, to stand up to those \r\nwho seek to divide societies through terror or to exploit \r\ndesperation for their own benefit. We need compassion \r\nto assist those less fortunate than ourselves and to help \r\nrebuild communities that have been devastated by war \r\nor natural disasters. And now, more than ever, we need \r\nto work together towards common solutions.\r\nThat is why Australia’s response to the global \r\nsurge in migration is based on three pillars. First is \r\nstrong border controls, with effective measures to \r\ncombat people-smuggling and terrorism, supported \r\nby a planned migration programme. Second is a \r\ncompassionate humanitarian policy, one that does not \r\nfocus merely on the numbers that we take in, but offers \r\nsubstantial resettlement programmes and supports \r\nthose countries hosting large numbers of refugees \r\nthemselves. The third pillar is effective international \r\nand regional cooperation. These three pillars are \r\ninherently interlinked. They cannot and do not work in \r\nisolation. We believe that in order to secure and maintain \r\npublic support for immigration, multiculturalism and a \r\ngenerous humanitarian programme, the public needs to \r\nknow that it is their own Government that controls their \r\nborders.\r\nIn the year before Australia’s strong border \r\nprotection policies were introduced, over 25,000 \r\nirregular migrants arrived in Australia by boat. Over \r\n1,200 people tragically died as a result, the victims of \r\nthe criminal enterprises that prey on vulnerable people \r\nfor profit. Without policies to ensure that we can decide \r\nwho enters Australia, it would not have been possible \r\nfor our Government to maintain the world’s third-\r\nlargest permanent refugee resettlement programme. It \r\nwould not have been possible for Australia to commit to \r\ntaking an additional 12,000 refugees displaced by the \r\nconflicts in Iraq and Syria, or to increase our broader \r\nhumanitarian intake by more than 35 per cent.\r\nWe are one of the most successful multicultural \r\nsocieties in the world. We are both as old as the oldest \r\ncontinuous human culture of our first Australians \r\nand as young as the child in the arms of her migrant \r\nparents. We are not defined by race, religion or culture, \r\nbut by shared political values of democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw and equality of opportunity — a “fair go”. More \r\nthan a quarter of us were born overseas, almost half \r\nof us have a parent born overseas, and each year we \r\nwelcome around 200,000 permanent migrants to join \r\nour 24 million. We have a long experience of, and \r\ncommitment to, settlement services to ensure that our \r\nimmigrants, especially refugees, become successfully \r\nintegrated into our society. We are indeed a nation of \r\nimmigrants who are as diverse as the society that they \r\nhave joined.\r\nOne such story is that of Aliir Aliir, who grew up \r\nin a refugee camp in Kenya after his family f led the \r\nbloody civil war in the Sudan. For Aliir, his family, \r\nand 150,000 other men, women and children, the \r\nKakuma refugee camp was home. The camp provided \r\nthe bare necessities of meals and shelter, but sports \r\nequipment was unimaginable. Aliir and his friends \r\nwould improvise with a balloon wrapped in strips \r\nof old clothing to serve as a football. He was seven \r\nwhen he and his family came to Australia. Tall, fast \r\nand agile, Aliir was a natural for Australian Rules \r\nFootball, and he has not looked back since he took \r\nup the game. Earlier this year, I was delighted when \r\nAliir debuted for the Australian Football League (AFL) \r\nteam I support, the Sydney Swans. Now 22, Aliir is \r\none of the first Sudanese immigrants to play for the \r\nAFL and has become a role model in our multicultural \r\nnation, especially for young people in Sydney. There \r\nare thousands of migrant stories like Aliir’s — leaders \r\nof Government, of business, of science and of the arts.\r\nAustralia would not be the country it is today without \r\ntheir contribution. Their stories are our stories, their \r\nsuccesses are our successes. Of course, each country \r\nmust adopt approaches that meet the needs of its own \r\npopulation and geography. But Australia’s experience \r\nsheds some light on what the solutions are — strong \r\nborders, vigilant security agencies governed by the rule \r\nof law, and a steadfast commitment to the shared values \r\nof freedom and mutual respect. These are the ingredients \r\nof multicultural success. And they are lessons we can \r\nshare to drive more effective, coordinated approaches \r\nto meet our humanitarian responsibilities.\r\nThat is why the New York Declaration for Refugees \r\nand Migrants (resolution 71/1), adopted here at the \r\nUnited Nations on Monday to drive a more orderly and \r\ncoordinated approach to migration and refugees, is so \r\nimportant. And that is why Australia and Indonesia, as \r\nCo-Chairs of the Bali Process on People Smuggling, \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n24/30 16-29503\r\nTrafficking in Persons and Related Transnational \r\nCrime, are working with the countries of our region to \r\nprotect migrants in vulnerable situations and to combat \r\npeople-smuggling.\r\nNow we need to see the world as it is, not as we \r\nwould like it to be, or as we fondly imagine it once was. \r\nSecure borders are essential. Porous borders drain away \r\npublic support for multiculturalism, for immigration \r\nand for aid to refugees. Most important of all, the \r\nonly way to stop the scourge of people-smuggling is \r\nto deprive the people-smugglers of their product, and \r\nsecure borders do just that.\r\nAnother fact we must recognize is that, while it \r\nwould be desirable for more nations to increase their \r\nhumanitarian intake, as Australia is doing, the truth is \r\nthat the scale of the refugee and internally displaced \r\npersons problem is so great — 65 million — that \r\nresettlement in other countries can never come close \r\nto being near enough. The most urgent priority is to \r\nre-establish stability and ensure security in the regions \r\nof conflict and, in addition, ensure that there are greater \r\nopportunities for economic advancement in the source \r\ncountries of so much of this irregular migration. All of \r\nthis requires cooperation, and that includes, as noted in \r\nthe New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants, \r\nthe willingness of Member States to accept the return \r\nof their citizens who do not qualify for protection, \r\nwhether on a voluntary or involuntary basis.\r\nRegional and national initiatives are crucial in our \r\nresponse to the surge in displaced people. Ultimately, \r\nwe will find sustainable solutions only by addressing \r\nthe root causes and drivers of this displacement. The \r\nlargest of these are conflict and instability. Conflict — in \r\nSyria, Iraq, Afghanistan, South Sudan, Libya, Yemen \r\nand other countries — is taking an unprecedented toll \r\non innocent civilians who, like all of us, wish to live \r\ntheir lives and raise their families in peace and security.\r\nAustralia’s armed forces are supporting the \r\nGovernment of Iraq in its efforts to liberate its territories \r\nfrom Da’esh. In defence of Iraq, we are joining with our \r\ncoalition partners to defeat Da’esh in Syria. It is of vital \r\nimportance that Da’esh’s so-called caliphate is defeated \r\nin the field. As Nadia Murad said on Monday in the \r\nGeneral Assembly (see A/71/PV.3), we must defeat \r\nthese terrorists, these monsters, who killed or enslaved \r\nher family, once and for all. Our support has helped to \r\nput Da’esh on the back foot — it has now lost around \r\n50 per cent of its territory in Iraq. \r\nBut conflict resolution is not enough. Establishing \r\nand maintaining a credible peace in the aftermath of \r\nconflict is just as important. In that regard, the United \r\nNations must play a vital role in building and sustaining \r\npeace. \r\nAustralia is proud to have worked with Angola \r\nto facilitate a resolution to reform the United Nations \r\npeacebuilding architecture. As the sixth-largest donor \r\nin 2015, Australia is pleased to be a key supporter of the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, which provides crucial assistance \r\nto peace agreements and supports capacity-building \r\nand rule-of-law projects in post-conflict societies. The \r\nUnited Nations role illustrates that vigilance against \r\nthe risk of new conflicts requires investing in and \r\nprotecting the international rules-based order. \r\nWe were all reminded of that recently when North \r\nKorea launched three medium-range ballistic missiles. \r\nDays later, Pyongyang conducted what we understand \r\nto be its largest-ever nuclear test. The provocative \r\nand dangerous actions of this rogue State breach \r\nunanimously agreed Security Council resolutions \r\nand threaten global peace and security. This shows \r\nwhy it was important for Australia and Myanmar \r\nto secure agreement at the East Asia Summit on a \r\nnew commitment to end the proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons and to work to support non-proliferation. \r\nSuch provocation requires action, and Australia will \r\nwork with the Security Council to support additional \r\nsanctions against North Korea.\r\nIt is this maturity and honesty that Australia \r\nwould bring to the Human Rights Council should we \r\nbe elected for our first-ever term, from 2018 to 2020. \r\nRather than denying problems, we will seek to identify \r\nthem, address them and learn from them. And we will \r\nhold others to the same standard as we hold ourselves.\r\nAustralia has prioritized five key areas in our \r\napproach to human rights: gender equality, governance, \r\nfreedom of expression, the rights of indigenous \r\npeoples, and strong national human rights institutions \r\nand capacity-building. We are committed to providing \r\nprincipled and pragmatic leadership across these five \r\nareas — both through our actions at home and our \r\nadvocacy and cooperation abroad. Over the course \r\nof the next decade and beyond, working together to \r\ncombat terrorism and conflict, prevent global health \r\npandemics, ensure universal access to clean water and \r\nsanitation, and address climate change will require \r\nenhanced global cooperation. \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 25/30\r\nI do not need to reiterate the significance and \r\ncomplexity of the threat of climate change. We all \r\nunderstand what is at stake: the future of generations \r\naround the globe and the well-being of our planet \r\nitself. If we are to be successful, we must all, every \r\none of us, act together to build a better world. And \r\nwe are. The Paris Agreement last year was a shining \r\nexample of global cooperation for the common good. \r\nIn a historic display of commitment, over 170 nations \r\nsigned the Paris Agreement in New York in April. Even \r\nmore have submitted plans for action, and Australia \r\nwill play its part. We are committed to ratifying the \r\nParis Agreement, and we are confident that we will \r\nmeet our ambitious 2030 target of cutting our per capita \r\nemissions by 52 per cent — just as we will meet and \r\nbeat our Kyoto Protocol commitments.\r\nAustralia has also increased the profile of climate \r\nchange in our overseas aid programme, including \r\nthrough our $200 million commitment to the Green \r\nClimate Fund, because we know climate change \r\namplifies many development challenges. We also know \r\nthat our commitment to action creates new opportunities \r\nfor innovation and growth, which means more jobs.\r\nWe are combining reductions in emissions with \r\nstrong economic growth, which, from a rate of 2 per \r\ncent a year ago, has been running at 3.3 per cent over \r\nthe past year. Our new cities policy, too, is focused on \r\nclean development, enhanced amenity, sustainability \r\nand livability. And, as the land of droughts and f looding \r\nrains, we have learned how to make every drop count \r\nand share our experience in water management with \r\nother nations, including earlier today at the High-level \r\nPanel on Water.\r\nIt would be remiss of me not to offer our deepest \r\nthanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nleadership and his commitment to addressing, over \r\nthe past decade, so many of the challenges I have \r\nmentioned here. The Secretary-General leaves an \r\nimportant legacy that his successor must now take \r\nforward with the international community. And as his \r\nsuccessor does so, we, the United Nations, must stay \r\nthe course. We must remain committed to displaying \r\nsufficient strength and courage to do what is needed in \r\nthe face of great adversity. We must continue to show \r\nthe compassion and understanding needed to ensure \r\nthat our societies are inclusive, diverse and resilient. \r\nAnd we must continue to cooperate at the regional and \r\ninternational levels to find common solutions to these \r\nglobal challenges. I am confident that together, as the \r\nUnited Nations, we will ensure a better future for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Commonwealth of Australia for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Malcolm Turnbull, Prime Minister of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nAddress by Mr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand. \r\nMr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted to the rostrum. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Prayut \r\nChan-o-cha, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of \r\nThailand, and inviting him to address the Assembly. \r\nMr. Chan-o-cha (Thailand) (spoke in Thai; \r\nEnglish interpretation provided by the delegation): \r\nLast year, the General Assembly adopted the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development as a plan of action \r\nfor balanced and sustainable global development. The \r\nAgenda puts all peoples at the heart of development \r\npolicy and aspires to give them equitable access to \r\nopportunity, progress and prosperity, while leaving no \r\none behind. Such a transformative Agenda represents \r\na crucial paradigm shift in the United Nations \r\ndevelopment agenda, which seeks to be more inclusive \r\nand more responsive to new challenges.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nThailand’s membership in the United Nations. It is \r\nalso the first year of the implementation of important \r\nagendas, such as the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction, the Paris Agreement, the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda and the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs). The international community must therefore \r\njoin hands and hearts so as to ensure that those agendas \r\nare implemented effectively.\r\nThailand firmly believes that sustainable \r\ndevelopment cannot take place where there is no \r\npeace and security or when human rights are violated, \r\nabused or disregarded. We also hold the opposite to be \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n26/30 16-29503\r\ntrue — that peace and security is unsustainable without \r\ndevelopment or when people are deprived of their \r\nrights. The three United Nations pillars are therefore \r\ntruly interconnected and mutually reinforcing. The \r\nrecent migration crisis is a clear example of just how \r\nintertwined the security, development and social \r\ndimensions are. No country is immune from the \r\neffects of crises happening in other parts of the world. \r\nIt is therefore our shared responsibility to address all \r\nchallenges at the root-cause level in order to derive \r\nsustainable solutions.\r\nToday we face multilayered and interconnected \r\nchallenges. Addressing them, as well as finding \r\nuniversal solutions to them, is made all the more \r\ncomplex because of the diversity of the world’s 7 billion \r\npeople in some 200 countries, with their different \r\nbeliefs, histories and cultures. The international \r\ncommunity should therefore work closely together to \r\nfind ways of achieving peaceful coexistence based on \r\nmutual understanding and respect, as well as shared \r\nresponsibility, where everyone is given opportunities \r\nand basic rights in an equitable and non-discriminatory \r\nmanner. We must also ensure full respect for, and \r\ncompliance with, our international obligations, \r\nespecially those whose breaching could have serious \r\nconsequences, such as obligations concerning nuclear \r\ndisarmament.\r\nIn order to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, we must take on shared responsibility and put \r\nin collective efforts, as well as promote the active \r\nengagement of regional, political and economic \r\ngroupings. No single country, even the most powerful or \r\nprosperous, can go it alone in that regard. International \r\ncooperation — be it North-South, South-South, or \r\ntriangular — is therefore essential and can be the \r\nuniversal push we need to transform our world.\r\nThis year, Thailand has the honour of serving as the \r\nChair of the Group of 77 (G-77). Our stated objective \r\nhas been to transform vision into concrete action. We \r\nhave therefore been coordinating and bridging the \r\nGroup’s position with other groups and partners, so as \r\nto enhance mutual trust and promote common interests. \r\nThis year, for the very first time, Thailand, as the chair \r\nof the G-77, was invited to the Group of Twenty (G-\r\n20) Summit, held in Hangzhou, where we took part in \r\ndiscussions on how to advance the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. That was an important and \r\nhistoric moment for the G-77, because the G-20 is a \r\ngrouping of the world’s major economies.\r\nAdditionally, Thailand has shared its experiences \r\nand lessons learned in overcoming socioeconomic \r\nchallenges through His Majesty the King’s Sufficiency \r\nEconomy Philosophy (SEP) as an alternative \r\ndevelopment model that takes a people-centred approach \r\nand emphasizes moderation, reason, resilience, virtue, \r\nknowledge and inclusiveness. That Thai model has so \r\nfar been applied and adapted to fit the national context \r\nin over 20 developing countries.\r\nSince assuming the G-77 chairmanship, Thailand \r\nhas initiated the SEP model for the SDGs partnership \r\nprogramme as a platform for the exchange of views, \r\nexperiences and best practices among members \r\non issues such as investment and information and \r\ncommunications technology for development. We \r\nhave also learned about homegrown approaches to \r\ndevelopment from one another through bilateral and \r\ntrilateral cooperation arrangements — for example, \r\nwith our development partners. \r\nThailand stands ready to promote further \r\ncooperation with all groups, such as the Brazil, Russia, \r\nIndia, China and South Africa group and the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), which also \r\nattach great importance to sustainable development. \r\nWe will also strengthen existing regional mechanisms \r\nso as to give further impetus to efforts to transform our \r\nworld. Next month, Thailand will host the second Asia \r\nCooperation Dialogue Summit to discuss, among other \r\nthings, the implementation of SDGs in the region.\r\nAt the ASEAN-United Nations Summit in Vientiane \r\nearlier this month, the Secretary-General spoke about \r\nthe important role played by regional mechanisms in \r\nthe promotion of international peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. All ASEAN leaders, including myself, \r\nbelieve that the efforts that we will be making to achieve \r\nthe SDGs will be key factors in the transformation of \r\nour world for the better.\r\nThe ASEAN Community is now in its first full year. \r\nIt has brought the peoples of ASEAN closer together, \r\nin particular through our economic and cultural links.\r\nWe see that closer cooperation will also help to reduce \r\nconflict and further promote peace within the region.\r\nThe Thai Government attaches great importance to \r\nachieving sustainable development. We have established \r\nthe National Committee on Sustainable Development \r\nand incorporated the SDGs into our twelfth National \r\nEconomic and Social Development Plan for 2017-2021 \r\nand our 20-year national strategy. We are continuing \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 27/30\r\nwith our policy of providing quality health-care services \r\nfor all, as well as ensuring equitable access to education \r\nfor all, whether they be Thai nationals, migrants or \r\nforeign workers. To that end, we can count on the \r\nGovernment’s universal health coverage programme \r\nas well as other initiatives, such as the anti-microbial \r\nresistance campaign. We also have a compulsory \r\neducation programme to ensure basic education for all.\r\nMoreover, the Government places high importance \r\non raising living standards, protecting freedoms, \r\nreducing disparities and promoting equitable access to \r\nbasic services. We have reviewed the relevant national \r\nlaws and regulations with a view to achieving tangible \r\nand sustainable results in those areas. We have enacted \r\nnew legislation on gender equality and have taken \r\nmeasures to protect at-risk and vulnerable groups, \r\nincluding newborn children, persons with disabilities \r\nand the elderly. We also provide adequate housing and \r\nland distribution to low-income earners, because we \r\nbelieve that those people, if empowered and protected, \r\ncan be valuable assets and important agents of change \r\nin our universal push to transform our world.\r\nOn the issue of climate change and the environment, \r\nThailand has ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. We call on other countries that have not yet \r\ndone so to become party to the Agreement at the \r\nearliest as a show of our joint commitment, solidarity \r\nand shared responsibility in addressing that issue, \r\nwhich affects all of humankind, especially small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nWith regard to our economy, the Thai Government \r\nis implementing the Thailand 4.0 programme, which \r\nemploys technology and innovation as driving forces for \r\ntargeted and sustainable economic development in such \r\nsectors as agriculture and industry. The programme \r\nemphasizes education, infrastructure, research and \r\ndevelopment, and also creates incentives and an \r\nenabling environment for the private sector through \r\nimprovements in business laws and regulations, so as \r\nto be able to fight corruption. We believe that such \r\nan approach will help overcome the middle-income \r\ntrap and allow our people to participate fully in the \r\ncountry’s future.\r\nOn peace and international security, Thailand has \r\nconsistently supported United Nations peacekeeping \r\nand peacebuilding operations. Our peacekeepers have \r\nparticipated in some 20 missions and have contributed \r\nto enabling local people to live normal lives, play a part \r\nin strengthening their own societies and participate in \r\nthe long-term development of their countries. Those \r\nefforts are also consistent with achieving SDG 16, \r\non peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThailand fully supports the effective implementation \r\nof SDG 17, on strengthened international cooperation \r\nand global partnership. We believe that there is no \r\none-size-fits-all model for development, since each \r\ncountry has its own specific needs and limitations. \r\nTherefore, we need to make the appropriate adaptations \r\nso as to fit the context of each country by sharing of \r\nexperiences and best practices, with a view to achieving \r\nunity in diversity.\r\nThe Thai Government has laid down the foundations \r\nfor sustainable development. On 7 August, the Thai \r\npeople voted to approve the draft Constitution in a \r\ndemocratic referendum. At present, constitutional by-\r\nlaws are being considered that will lead to the holding \r\nof general elections in late 2017, in accordance with \r\nour road map. That referendum reflects the genuine \r\nintentions of the Government to promote the democratic \r\nprocess, while taking into account the views expressed \r\nby the international community. The Government came \r\nin to oversee the transition period and restore order \r\nand security. Once the situation returned to normal \r\nwith security restored, the Government ended certain \r\ntemporary measures, such as by lifting, last week, the \r\nmilitary jurisdiction over civilians.\r\nThe Government remains actively engaged in \r\naddressing long-neglected and deeply rooted problems \r\nof security, corruption, human trafficking and \r\ncrime. We believe that addressing the root causes of \r\nsuch problems can serve as a strong foundation for \r\nsustainable democracy and good governance, with the \r\nhope that Thailand and the Thai people will remain \r\nconstructive members of the global community in the \r\nlong term.\r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\npay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nefforts throughout the past decade. He has been the man \r\nbehind many important and commendable initiatives \r\ndriving change and progress in the international \r\ncommunity — for example, the Human Rights Up Front \r\ninitiative and the Agenda for Humanity. I wish him all \r\nthe best in his future endeavours.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n28/30 16-29503\r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Thailand for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Prayut Chan-o-cha, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Thailand, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Sebastian Kurz, Federal \r\nMinister for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Austria. \r\nMr. Kurz (Austria): I belong to a generation that \r\nwas born into a globalized world. For us, globalization \r\nis not a threat — it is a fact of life. As Kofi Annan \r\nonce said, arguing against globalization is like arguing \r\nagainst the laws of gravity. Let us be clear: the fact \r\nthat the world has grown closer together has brought \r\nabout enormous benefits. It has reduced international \r\npoverty, contributed to the spread of technology and \r\nreduced the distances between countries.\r\nBut we must also recognize that globalization has \r\nnot only led to positive consequences; it also created \r\nnew challenges. Events taking place on the other side \r\nof the globe can have a direct impact on our lives. That \r\nincludes not only in the economic world, but in all \r\nspheres of life. Especially in recent years, we have seen \r\na dramatic increase in threats to stability throughout \r\nthe world.\r\nWhen I started out as Foreign Minister, in \r\nDecember 2013, Ukraine had full sovereignty over its \r\neastern borders and Crimea. The Iraqi Government was \r\nstill in control of Mosul and other parts of the country, \r\nand religious minorities, such as the Yazidis, still lived \r\nin peace and security in their homeland. Yet today, \r\nthinking in terms of confrontational blocs has returned \r\nto Europe. Today Da’esh threatens whole States, and \r\nradicalization and violent extremism are on the rise \r\nworldwide.\r\nGiven those developments, I can understand that \r\npeople are shocked and overburdened by the many \r\nimages they see of violence, suffering and destruction, \r\nand that they would wish to block those images from \r\ntheir living rooms. But the truth is that, while one can \r\nturn off the television and block off the news from one’s \r\nhome, what cannot be changed in a globalized world is \r\nthe fact that something taking place elsewhere can have \r\na direct impact on our lives. The more interconnected \r\nour world becomes, the greater the responsibility of \r\neach one of us is to not ignore events taking place in \r\nother parts of the world. The more globalized our world \r\nbecomes, the more interest each one of us must take \r\nin strengthening stability and prosperity in other parts \r\nof the world, not only out of solidarity but also out of \r\nself-interest. \r\nOne thing is very clear today: we all need to join \r\nforces. We need the United Nations, the European \r\nUnion (EU) and the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE). And we need effective \r\nmultilateralism to achieve what we most desire, namely, \r\nsecurity and stability.\r\nToday threats to security and stability arise from \r\nmany challenges at the same time. The destruction \r\ncaused by military conflicts is increasing, violent \r\nextremism is growing and weapons of mass destruction \r\nstill exist. The conflict that is closest to us in Austria is \r\nthe one in Crimea and eastern Ukraine. We remain very \r\nconcerned, because the Minsk Agreement has still not \r\nbeen implemented, and progress has been frustratingly \r\nslow. In our opinion, we need to find solutions beyond \r\nthe ceasefires. We need a free and stable Ukraine that \r\nhas good relations with both the Russian Federation and \r\nthe European Union.\r\nTo achieve greater security, we must rebuild trust. \r\nIn that respect, the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe, which reaches from Vancouver \r\nto Vladivostok, is uniquely placed to promote stability \r\nand security. During Austria’s chairmanship of the \r\nOSCE in 2017, we intend to contribute to rebuilding \r\ntrust and defusing conflicts in the OSCE area, such \r\nas in eastern Ukraine, Georgia, Nagorno Karabakh \r\nand Transnistria. But we are also faced with a ring \r\nof instability in Europe’s wider neighbourhood — in \r\nSyria, Iraq and Libya.\r\nOn Syria, we need to reinforce diplomatic \r\nefforts to establish a ceasefire, enable safe access for \r\nhumanitarian aid and start a political process. That is \r\nthe only way to end the ongoing humanitarian crisis \r\nin that long-suffering country. We are outraged by the \r\nattacks on medical facilities and aid convoys. Let me \r\nbe clear: all of those who committed crimes against \r\ncivilians must be brought to justice.\r\nAround the globe, radicalization and violent \r\nextremism pose serious threats to our societies, \r\nundermining security, development, human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms. We must all realize that acts \r\nof religious extremism do not happen only in areas of \r\nconflict; there are religious extremists who radicalize \r\n21/09/2016 A/71/PV.13\r\n16-29503 29/30\r\nour youth even in the heart of our own societies. Tens \r\nof thousands of foreign fighters have joined the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant in order to rape, kill and try \r\nto exterminate religious minorities in other parts of the \r\nworld. They include more than 5,000 people from the \r\nEU, among them 300 from Austria. We cannot accept \r\nthat our citizens commit such crimes in other parts of \r\nthe world, and we have to be clear that when they return, \r\nthey pose a major threat to our societies. We therefore \r\nhave to increase efforts within our communities to \r\nprevent young people from being misled by those who \r\nabuse religion.\r\nWe also have to remain committed in our fight \r\nagainst Da’esh and other terrorist groups in countries \r\nlike Syria, Iraq and Libya, because destroying Da’esh \r\nwould be the most powerful measure to counter \r\nradicalization. The more we deny radical terrorists their \r\nsuccess stories, the fewer new fighters will be recruited \r\nfrom other parts of the world. If we are unsuccessful \r\nin that fight, we will see increased radicalization and \r\nterrorism worldwide, with no safe havens, neither in \r\nEurope nor elsewhere.\r\nIn an ever less secure world facing ever greater \r\ntensions among the major Powers, nuclear disarmament \r\nremains the number one unfinished business. The recent \r\nnuclear tests by the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea serve as a warning sign. We all agree that \r\nthe humanitarian consequences of a nuclear-weapon \r\nexplosion would be unacceptable. We must therefore \r\nfinally rid ourselves of all nuclear weapons. Experience \r\nshows that the first step in eliminating weapons of mass \r\ndestruction is to prohibit them through legally binding \r\nnorms. Together with other Member States, Austria will \r\nsubmit a draft resolution to convene negotiations on a \r\nlegally binding comprehensive instrument to prohibit \r\nnuclear weapons in 2017.\r\nBut that is not enough. We also need to put an end \r\nto the use of explosive weapons in populated areas. \r\nWhen such weapons are used in cities and other urban \r\nareas — as we have seen in Syria — more than 90 per \r\ncent of the victims are civilians. The destruction of \r\nhomes, hospitals, schools and other infrastructure \r\nforces people to leave. The world would be a safer place \r\nwithout such weapons, especially for children, women \r\nand elderly people. We will therefore convene a meeting \r\nin early October to promote that goal, and we hope for \r\nMembers’ support.\r\nThe United Nations is central when it comes to \r\ntackling the global challenges of our time. We need an \r\neffective guardian for our shared values and principles. \r\nWe need a strong United Nations to provide security, \r\nachieve stability and restore people’s confidence. In \r\nthat context, I would like to express my gratitude to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his leadership \r\nduring his two terms at the United Nations. His moral \r\nleadership has made it possible to achieve success, \r\ninter alia, through the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. Let me assure all of those present that Austria \r\nwill remain committed to supporting the United Nations \r\nand its goals, both as a Member State and as the host \r\ncountry to one of its headquarters.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the general debate for this \r\nmeeting. \r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers in exercise of the \r\nright of reply, may I remind members that statements in \r\nexercise of the right of reply are limited to 10 minutes \r\nfor the first intervention, and to 7 minutes for the \r\nsecond intervention, and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMs. Gambhir (India): I take the f loor today in \r\nexercise of the right of reply in response to the long \r\ntirade earlier today by the representative of Pakistan \r\nabout the situation in the Indian State of Jammu and \r\nKashmir (see A/71/PV.11). The worst violation of human \r\nrights is terrorism; when practiced as an instrument \r\nof State policy, it becomes a war crime. What my \r\ncountry and other neighbours in our region are facing \r\ntoday is Pakistan’s long-standing policy of sponsoring \r\nterrorism, the consequences of which have spread well \r\nbeyond our region.\r\nOnly last week, the international community \r\nhonoured the memory of the thousands of innocent \r\nvictims around the world who lost their lives not \r\nfar from here in New York, 15 years ago, in a most \r\nhorrifying terrorist attack. The world has not yet \r\nforgotten that the trail of that dastardly attack led all \r\nthe way to Abbottabad, in Pakistan. The land of Taxila, \r\none of the greatest learning centres of ancient times, \r\nis now host to the Ivy League of terrorism. It attracts \r\naspirants and apprentices from all over the world. The \r\neffects of its toxic curriculum are felt across the globe.\r\nIt is therefore ironic that we have heard today the \r\npreaching of human rights and ostensible support for \r\nA/71/PV.13 21/09/2016\r\n30/30 16-29503\r\nself-determination by a country that has established \r\nitself as the global epicentre of terrorism. Shortly before \r\nPakistan gave its hypocritical sermon in the Hall, its \r\nenvoy in New Delhi was summoned in the context of the \r\nmost recent of the terror attacks, in Uri, which claimed \r\n18 Indian lives. That terrorist attack is part of a trail of \r\nthe continuous f low of terrorists trained and armed by \r\nour neighbour and tasked to carry out terrorist attacks \r\nin my country.\r\nWhat we see in Pakistan is a terrorist State that \r\nchannels billions of dollars, much of it diverted \r\nfrom international aid, to training, financing and \r\nsupporting terrorist groups as militant proxies against \r\nits neighbours. Terrorist entities and their leaders, \r\nincluding many so designated by the United Nations, \r\ncontinue to roam its streets freely and operate with State \r\nsupport. With the approval of the authorities, many \r\nterrorist organizations raise funds openly, in f lagrant \r\nviolation of Pakistan’s international obligations.\r\nEven today, we have heard support expressed by \r\nthe Prime Minister of Pakistan for a self-acknowledged \r\ncommander of a known terrorist organization, Hizbul \r\nMujahideen. Pakistan is a country with a democracy \r\ndeficit. In fact, it practices terrorism on its own people. \r\nIt extends support to extremist groups, suppresses \r\nminorities and women, and denies basic human rights, \r\nincluding through draconian laws. \r\nAs a democracy, India is firmly resolved to protect \r\nall our citizens from all acts of terrorism in Jammu and \r\nKashmir. We cannot and will not allow terrorism to \r\nprevail.\r\nFinally, we have heard Pakistan, whose nuclear \r\nproliferation record is marked by deception and deceit, \r\ntalk about restraint, renunciation and peace. It has \r\nmade similar false promises to us — the international \r\ncommunity — on terrorism. Perhaps the renunciation \r\nof lies and self-restraint on threats would be a good \r\nplace for Pakistan to start.\r\nMr. Faisal (Pakistan): The Indian Government has \r\nchosen to criticize the statement made by the Prime \r\nMinister of Pakistan (see A/71/PV.11), which reflects \r\nthe sentiments and aspirations of the oppressed people \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir. For 70 years they have faced the \r\nbullets, repression and brutality of an illegal occupation. \r\nNo number of statements can alter that historical fact. \r\nThe dispute involving Jammu and Kashmir cannot \r\nbe wished away. Pakistan will continue to stand by \r\nthe people of Jammu and Kashmir and extend its full \r\ndiplomatic and political support to their movement for \r\nfreedom from Indian oppression.\r\nThe cold-blooded murder of Burhan Wani sparked \r\nwidespread and unprecedented protests across \r\nKashmir, which were spontaneous and indigenous and \r\nprovided irrefutable evidence of the Kashmiri people’s \r\nrejection of the Indian occupation. Peaceful protesters \r\nwere mercilessly fired upon, blinded and critically \r\ninjured. Yet the use of brutal force cannot extinguish \r\ntheir burning aspirations. Every day, young and old \r\ncome, defying the curfew and dodging the bullets as \r\nthey seek merely to assert their right to determine \r\ntheir own destiny. The right to self-determination has \r\nbeen promised to them by the international community \r\nthrough a series of Security Council resolutions. \r\nAlthough that promise has yet to be realized seven \r\ndecades later, time has not weakened their resolve or \r\ntheir aspirations. In fact, that goal remains active and \r\nvibrant in the hearts of the Kashmiris.\r\nThe people of Indian-occupied Kashmir look to the \r\ninternational community, especially the members of \r\nthe Security Council, to deliver on the pledge to hold a \r\nfree, fair and impartial plebiscite under United Nations \r\nauspices, so as to enable the people there to decide their \r\nfuture. That is the democratic and legal right of the \r\nKashmiri people. No amount of verbiage on the part of \r\nthe Indian delegation can obfuscate that reality.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.10 p.m.\r\n"
