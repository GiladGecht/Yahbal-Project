"United Nations A/71/PV.14\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n14th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 22 September 2016, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Zamora Rivas \r\n(El Salvador), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Biya, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cameroon\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Paul \r\nBiya, President of the Republic of Cameroon, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Biya (spoke in French): Cameroon \r\nwishes to congratulate Mr. Thomson on his election to \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. His great experience at the national and \r\ninternational levels, and in the public and private \r\nsectors, and his well-known personal qualities augur \r\nwell for the success of our work. I would like in that \r\nregard to assure him of the support of my country and \r\nthe full cooperation of our delegation. I would also like \r\nto recognize the work accomplished by his predecessor, \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, whose term of office was \r\ncharacterized by successful initiatives to make the \r\nUnited Nations more open and transparent.\r\nFinally, I would like to pay special tribute to Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon for his remarkable accomplishments during \r\nhis two terms in a particularly difficult international \r\ncontext. Cameroon, for its part, was honoured by his \r\nmemorable visit in 2010. It welcomes the strengthening \r\nduring his term of our exceptional bonds of excellent \r\ncooperation with the United Nations.\r\nThis session opens at a time of turmoil in which, \r\nfortunately, we see some glimmers of hope. In a spirit \r\nof human solidarity, we have in recent years laid the \r\nfoundations for a common destiny for humankind. I \r\nam particularly referring to the document significantly \r\nentitled “The future we want”, adopted at the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development, held \r\nin Rio de Janeiro in 2012 (resolution 66/288, annex). \r\nI would also refer to the 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) of the new 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Finally, I must mention the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, prepared at the twenty-\r\nfirst Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nIn that context, my country welcomes the President’s \r\ndecision to place his term under the banner of the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We therefore welcome the convening \r\nof this debate on the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nnine months after their adoption and entry into force. \r\nThe SDGs, it should be recalled, constitute the first \r\nglobal agenda to consider the issue of development in \r\nall its dimensions — security, economic, social, human \r\nand environmental.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It truly focuses on human progress, \r\nhumanity’s heritage, the common well-being and \r\nsecurity for all. It is an ambitious Agenda that requires \r\neveryone’s genuine involvement. Under the Agenda, \r\nour common goal is to eradicate poverty and to leave \r\nno one behind. That is a challenge that we have set \r\nfor ourselves and that we must assume in solidarity in \r\norder to meet the expectations of our peoples and take \r\nthe summons of history to heart.\r\nAs everyone knows, we have in the past adopted \r\nagendas, declarations and action programmes that \r\nhave raised great hopes around the world among young \r\npeople, women and men, both urban and rural. They \r\nwere harbingers of a new world of peace and shared \r\nprosperity. Yet the adopted actions were only partially \r\nimplemented, a situation that we regretted at the time. In \r\nthis Hall, we have failed to honour all our commitments, \r\nespecially the financial ones. We have not fulfilled all \r\nthe hopes and aspirations of our peoples.\r\nToday, we need to get organized so as to ensure \r\nthat the Sustainable Development Goals fare better. \r\nSince the goal is to transform our world and leave no \r\none behind, we must find the wherewithal to realize \r\nour ambitions, which fall into three categories. First, \r\nthere is the political: our political will must be constant \r\nand not wax and wane according to circumstances. \r\nSecondly, in the financial category, our contributions \r\nshould be effective, certain and adequate. That will \r\nrequire unprecedented mobilization. Lastly, from a \r\nmoral perspective, the principle of the duty of solidarity \r\namong peoples should be reaffirmed and observed. In \r\ndoing so, we will be helping the SDGs to accelerate the \r\nadvent of a world of peace for everyone everywhere — a \r\nworld of prosperity for all.\r\nAs the Assembly knows, it is no longer time for \r\npromises. It is time for commitment; time for action. \r\nOur efforts will encounter various obstacles, including \r\npersistent conflicts and increasing terrorism. My \r\ncountry is in a position to talk about that, having \r\nbeen engaged over the past three years in a veritable \r\nwar against the scourge of terrorism. That new type \r\nof threat to peace and development requires, I repeat, \r\na collective response, collective determination and \r\ncollective action. Goal 16 of the Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which focuses on the promotion and \r\nthe advent of peaceful and inclusive societies should, \r\nin our case, help us to effectively fight Boko Haram. \r\nAs underscored by one of the targets of that Goal, we \r\nshould\r\n“strengthen relevant national institutions, including \r\nthrough international cooperation, for building \r\ncapacity at all levels, in particular in developing \r\ncountries, to prevent violence and combat terrorism \r\nand crime”.\r\nCameroon wishes to thank the President for having \r\ninvited us, along with the other States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, to today’s debate on the implementation \r\nof the SDGs, the new universal push to transform \r\nthe world. The outcomes of previous agendas and \r\nprogrammes have shown us the urgent need to find the \r\nwherewithal to achieve our ambitions. If we decide, \r\nhere and now, to effectively and tangibly mobilize our \r\nimmense resources and if we decide to devote them to \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals, then the \r\nSDGs will truly become the push to transform today’s \r\nworld into a world of peace and shared prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cameroon for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic of \r\nCyprus, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Anastasiades: It is a great honour \r\nto address the Assembly once again. I would like to \r\nstart by joining the previous speakers in conveying my \r\nGovernment’s congratulations to Ambassador Peter \r\nThomson on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session.\r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 3/46\r\nLast year, we, the leaders of the international \r\ncommunity, came together in the realization that, in an \r\nincreasingly interdependent world, all of our actions \r\nare, more than ever before, closely connected and \r\nimpact one another. We therefore collectively pledged \r\nto implement the Sustainable Development Goals, so as \r\nto transform our world for the benefit of humankind. \r\nThe universal, comprehensive and indivisible 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development represents a \r\ncommon reference point for all of us and our guiding \r\ntool as we attempt to effectively tackle the universal \r\nchallenges that transcend boundaries and threaten \r\nregional and international cohesion.\r\nChallenges such as poverty, hunger, child mortality, \r\nsocial and economic inequality, lack of adequate health \r\nstandards and educational opportunities have, in turn, \r\naggravated worrying phenomena such as religious \r\nfundamentalism, sectarianism, terrorism, civil war and \r\nethnic conflicts. The combination of all those factors \r\nhas resulted in the extraordinary humanitarian crisis we \r\nare witnessing in the forcible displacement of millions \r\nof people, with the consequent unprecedented wave of \r\nrefugees and migration f lows that we are all witnessing, \r\nsome of us at our doorstep. In that regard, it goes \r\nwithout saying that, in order to reverse such disturbing \r\ndevelopments and establish more prosperous, just and \r\npeaceful societies, we need to address collectively and \r\nin an effective manner the root causes that have led to \r\nthe uncontrolled exacerbation of those f lows, through a \r\ntwo-fold interrelated approach.\r\nFirst, by directing and concentrating our efforts so \r\nas to finally make sustainable development possible in \r\nall of the countries and regions in need. That can be \r\nachieved only if we adopt a targeted and results-oriented \r\napproach towards development cooperation, which \r\nwill create the political and socioeconomic conditions \r\nneeded for institution-building, stability and economic \r\ngrowth by, inter alia, eliminating inequality and social \r\nexclusion, addressing gender inequality and combating \r\ngender-based violence, facilitating investment in \r\nhuman capital via capacity development and education, \r\nespecially by promoting girls’ education, strengthening \r\nthe role of key productive sectors, such as agriculture, \r\nenergy and health, building resilience and fostering full \r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, \r\nand enhancing good governance and promoting the rule \r\nof law, as well as combating corruption.\r\nSecondly, we need to resourcefully confront the \r\nthreats posed by ongoing conflicts, as well as prevent \r\nfuture ones, in order to achieve lasting and viable \r\npolitical solutions that will promote regional peace, \r\nsecurity and predictability. To that end, I wish to recall \r\nthat the current session of the General Assembly was \r\npreceded by the High-level Meeting on large movements \r\nof refugees and migrants, during which we confirmed \r\nour shared responsibility to collectively address the \r\nissue of enforced human displacement. In parallel, all \r\nof us should direct our efforts, in an inclusive way, to \r\ncombat human traffickers and the enablers of terrorism. \r\nGiven that in today’s globalized world, all of us, even if \r\nin different contexts and to varying degrees, inevitably \r\nface some or all of those challenges, meaningful and \r\neffective multilateralism should be reinforced. That \r\nis critical. To that end, we should reconsider the \r\nprevention and conflict-resolution mechanisms at our \r\ndisposal, with a view to making them more efficient, \r\neffective and immediate.\r\nThat can be achieved only by strengthening our \r\nsupport for and commitment to the United Nations, \r\nwhich is the only international forum that was \r\nestablished by all of us with the aim of cooperatively \r\nresolving regional and international threats to \r\npeace and security. Otherwise, we run the risk of an \r\nindefinite perpetuation of the current humanitarian \r\ncrisis and ongoing conflicts, which would serve the \r\nbest interests of their perpetrators at the expense of our \r\nuniversal principles.\r\nAs his 10-year tenure is coming to an end, I \r\nwish to convey both my Government’s and my \r\npersonal appreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, the \r\nSecretary-General, for his service in the promotion \r\nof our common values, and for his hard work and \r\naccomplishments. In particular, I wish to commend him \r\nfor his instrumental role in getting the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development adopted, for his work on \r\nthe recent agreement on the Comprehensive Refugee \r\nResponse Framework and, of course, for bringing the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on climate change to a \r\nsuccessful conclusion through the Paris Agreement. It \r\nis an agreement that Cyprus is committed to ratifying \r\nby the end of the year. Moreover, I wish to thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his active role in achieving \r\na peaceful and comprehensive settlement on long-\r\nstanding international issues, including the Cyprus \r\nproblem — a problem that, sadly, is the second-longest-\r\nstanding unresolved international issue on the United \r\nNations agenda.\r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n4/46 16-29553\r\nFollowing the tragic events of 1974 and Turkey’s \r\ninvasion, the continuing military occupation of more \r\nthan a third of the territory of the Republic of Cyprus \r\nand, at the same time, the forced displacement of \r\napproximately 40 per cent of the population, the Greek \r\nCypriot side, in a spirit of compromise, accepted the \r\ntransformation of the unitary State into a federal one. \r\nSince then, a plethora of Security Council resolutions \r\nhave reaffirmed the basis of the settlement as a \r\nbicommunal, bizonal federation with political equality, \r\nas well as the high-level agreements, with a single \r\ninternational legal personality, a single sovereignty and \r\na single citizenship. At the same time, successive leaders \r\nof the two communities have engaged unsuccessfully \r\nso far in numerous rounds of talks.\r\nFollowing my election in 2013, a renewed effort \r\nat negotiation on 11 February 2014 led to the adoption \r\nof the Joint Declaration by the leaders of the two \r\ncommunities and the resumption of the negotiating \r\nprocess. On the one hand, the Joint Declaration \r\nencapsulates the following fundamental principles: the \r\nreaffirmation of the basis of the settlement; Cyprus’ \r\ncontinued membership in the United Nations and the \r\nEuropean Union (EU); the values upon which the EU \r\nis founded shall be safeguarded throughout the island, \r\nwith full respect for democratic principles, human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms; and union, in whole or in \r\npart, with any other country or any form of partition or \r\nsecession or any other unilateral change to the state of \r\naffairs shall be prohibited.\r\nOn the other hand, it established the methodology \r\nof the talks. All chapters would be discussed \r\ninterdependently. The process would be led by the \r\nleaders, and only an agreement freely reached by them \r\nmight be put to simultaneous referenda. Any kind of \r\narbitration would, therefore, be excluded. Nothing \r\nwould be considered as agreed until everything is \r\nagreed. The leaders would aim to reach a settlement \r\nas soon as possible, without any enforced or artificial \r\ntimelines. Thus, both communities have agreed on the \r\noverarching rules and modalities that are to guide the \r\nnegotiating process. That has enabled the two leaders to \r\nhave a clear and shared understanding on the framework \r\nof the envisaged settlement and on the ways and means \r\nof achieving it.\r\nLast year, following the change in the leadership of \r\nthe Turkish Cypriot community, I spoke of my revived \r\nhope that the new round of negotiations would end the \r\nunacceptable status quo. This year, following a series of \r\nfrequent meetings between the two leaders, I have the \r\npleasure of informing the Assembly that progress has \r\nbeen achieved on the important aspects of the Cyprus \r\nproblem, confirming, inter alia, that United Cyprus \r\nwill have a single international legal personality, a \r\nsingle sovereignty and a single citizenship, thereby \r\nguaranteeing, for all Cypriots, the freedom of movement \r\nand the right to acquire property, reside, practise a \r\ntrade or profession and establish and operate a business \r\nor engage in any economic activity throughout Cyprus; \r\nfull respect for the individual’s right to property; \r\nensuring that the demographic character of the island on \r\nthe first day of the settlement will ref lect, with a slight \r\ndeviation, the traditional demographic composition of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus as established in 1960; ensuring \r\nthat the said demographic composition will not be \r\naltered by outside influences; the implementation of the \r\nEU acquis throughout the territory of Cyprus, without \r\ndeviations or permanent derogations; and protecting \r\nthe bizonal and bicommunal character of the settlement \r\nthrough specific clauses.\r\nAs agreed by the two leaders, the federal \r\nConstitution shall prescribe that the United Cyprus \r\nFederation shall be composed of two constituent \r\nStates of equal status, establishing the mode in which \r\npolitical equality will be exercised, including the \r\neffective participation in decision-making at the federal \r\nlevel. I must admit that further convergence has been \r\nreached on most aspects in the chapters on governance, \r\neconomy and the European Union to the benefit of all \r\nTurkish and Greek Cypriots. At the same time, what \r\nis also encouraging is that, in contrast to previous \r\nnegotiations, discussions in the form of brainstorming \r\nhave, for the first time, commenced in relation to the \r\nchapters on territorial readjustments and security.\r\nI do not wish to overlook the significant progress \r\nthat has been achieved; however, I feel obliged to stress \r\nthat differences remain on a number of issues regarding \r\nthe chapters on governance, the EU and the economy. \r\nBut the most significant divergences lie in the core \r\nand fundamental chapters on property, territory, and \r\nsecurity and guarantees, which will significantly \r\nimpact whether a solution could be feasible in the very \r\nnear future.\r\nMy aim is to avoid the failures of the past and \r\nto present to the people a clear and well-prepared \r\nsettlement with no interpretive or other ambiguities and \r\ndeficiencies, ensuring that the solution will be politically \r\nand economically viable, functional and lasting. In that \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 5/46\r\nrespect, we need to address the financial dimension of \r\nthe settlement, including costs related to the property \r\nissue and the institutional functioning of the Federal \r\nState; the safeguarding of the smooth implementation \r\nof the agreement; the first day of the solution and what \r\nit would entail; the introduction of the euro as legal \r\ntender on day one of the settlement; and, one of the \r\nmost important issues, the speedy implementation of \r\nthe various aspects of the agreement, among others.\r\nI wish to reiterate yet again my resolve to continue \r\nworking with the same determination and intensive \r\npace, in order to reach a solution as soon as possible, \r\nhopefully, by the end of the year. I believe that this \r\nambitious goal is achievable, provided that all interested \r\nparties and stakeholders show a similar degree of \r\ncommitment, engage constructively and proceed with \r\nconcrete and tangible steps that positively reinforce the \r\nnegotiating process.\r\nWe need a solution that will reunite our country, \r\nits people, the economy and our institutions; create a \r\nwin-win situation for all Cypriots — we do not want \r\nto create winners or leave behind losers; address the \r\nexpectations, sensitivities and concerns of both Greek \r\nand Turkish Cypriots; ensure the building of a modern \r\nEU and United Nations Member State, enjoying full \r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity; \r\nrestore and fully respect the fundamental freedoms \r\nand human rights of all its citizens; establish Cyprus \r\nas an international paradigm of peaceful coexistence \r\nand prosperous collaboration between all of its citizens, \r\nirrespective of their different ethnic, cultural and \r\nreligious diversity; and rid Cyprus of third-country \r\nmilitary troops and guarantees, an anachronism in \r\ntoday’s world.\r\nIt is my firm belief that the solution of the problem \r\nin Cyprus would, first and foremost, be to the benefit of \r\nall Cypriots, by creating conditions of peace, prosperity \r\nand a f lourishing society, and unlocking the country’s \r\nfull potential for future generations. Regionally, it \r\nwould turn Cyprus into a model country of stability and \r\npredictability, and would broaden the role of Cyprus as \r\na security-provider in one of the most turbulent areas \r\nof the world. At the European level, it would end the \r\noxymoron of one of its Member States being divided, \r\nwhile it would also positively reinforce relations \r\nbetween the European Union and Turkey, as well as \r\nstrengthen the rest of the security architecture of the \r\nEU. Last but not least, solving an international problem \r\nthat has been on the agenda of the United Nations for \r\nthe past several decades will offer a beacon of hope, \r\nshowing that even the most intractable problems can be \r\nsolved peacefully through the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of \r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Sierra Leone.\r\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ernest Bai \r\nKoroma, President of the Republic of Sierra Leone, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Koroma: I congratulate the President \r\non his election, and I commend his predecessor for his \r\neffective leadership at the previous session.\r\nLet me also, on behalf of the Government and the \r\npeople of Sierra Leone, applaud His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon for his dedication and commitment to the \r\nadvancement of global peace and development during \r\nhis 10 years of service to our Organization as Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I commend him for his vision and initiatives, \r\nincluding the major high-level panel reviews, the \r\nhistoric adoption of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate \r\nchange and convening the first World Humanitarian \r\nSummit. We in Sierra Leone will always remember \r\nthe Secretary-General with deep appreciation for his \r\nexemplary role in mobilizing support for the successful \r\nfight against the deadly Ebola disease.\r\nThe theme chosen by the President for our debate \r\nthis year, “The Sustainable Development Goals: a \r\nuniversal push to transform our world”, could not have \r\nbeen more thoughtful. In order to achieve that goal, we \r\nmust universally promote the Sustainable Development \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n6/46 16-29553\r\nGoals. We must push forward with energy, compassion \r\nand resolve to save the millions of women and children \r\nstill trapped in poverty, bring peace to our troubled \r\nregion, and prevent and contain disease outbreaks.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, drawing on the lessons learned from \r\nthe implementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, we have taken action to quickly integrate the \r\nSDGs into our national development planning processes \r\nby linking each of the 17 Goals and 169 targets to \r\nour national development programme — the Agenda \r\nfor Prosperity. Sierra Leone was one of the 22 countries \r\nreviewed during the Economic and Social Council’s \r\nHigh-Level Political Forum in July. We shared our \r\nviews on how we want to implement the SDGs, on the \r\nchallenges we foresee and on how we hope to overcome \r\nthem. At the same time, we have formulated a national \r\nintegrated results framework that aligns the SDGs with \r\nour Alliance for Prosperity monitoring and evaluation \r\nmechanism. We have also established an international \r\nbenchmarks system for Sierra Leone, which will enable \r\nus to address the challenges involved in obtaining the \r\nreliable statistical data we need in order to report on \r\nour progress.\r\nBut whatever we do at the national level, whatever \r\nefforts we make on the global stage, whatever projects \r\nthe brightest among us design, we will not be able to \r\ndeliver on the SDGs’ promise of an inclusive, fairer and \r\nbetter world without the reform of the United Nations. \r\nLet me be blunt. Our premier global institution lacks \r\nthe democratic characteristics needed to tackle the \r\ndevelopment, security and other challenges facing \r\nAfrica and many other parts of the world. Without strong \r\nAfrican voices at the highest level of our premier global \r\ndecision-making body, without the energetic voices of \r\nthe region that is home to the world’s largest number of \r\nyoung people, and without the decisive contribution of \r\nthe continent that is most affected by Security Council \r\ndecisions, no solution that the United Nations might \r\npropose to our challenges can be sustainable, inclusive \r\nor lasting.\r\nYes, Africa’s position is about righting historical \r\nwrongs and enhancing its voice in the United \r\nNations. But most of all, Africa’s position relates to \r\nour contribution to making the United Nations more \r\neffective, democratic and forward-looking. That is why \r\nwe believe that the dilution of any of its key elements \r\nis akin to continuing a status quo that is unfair, \r\nunjust, non-inclusive and unfit for the requirements \r\nof the twenty-first century. Africa has asked me, as \r\nCoordinator of its African Union Committee of Ten \r\nHeads of State on United Nations Reforms, to tell the \r\nworld that we will stand united behind the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration. At the African \r\nUnion’s July summit in Kigali we reaffirmed the \r\nAfrican position, and we deplore any attempts to \r\nweaken any of those positions through divide-and-rule \r\npolicies that are reminiscent of the colonial era.\r\nIn September last year at the Leaders’ Summit \r\non Peacekeeping, we committed to enlarging and \r\nmodernizing United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nI made a pledge at the Summit to contribute further \r\nto United Nations peacekeeping with commitments to \r\nprovide two formed police units, special weapons and \r\ntactics units and police guards to the United Nations \r\nStand-by Arrangements System, and we are now ready \r\nto deploy at short notice.\r\nSierra Leone welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport prepared for the World Humanitarian Summit \r\n(A/70/709) and its annex, the Agenda for Humanity. \r\nThis year’s World Humanitarian Summit was a turning \r\npoint at which we collectively pledged to improve our \r\nresponse to people caught in natural disasters and \r\nconflicts, empower them as agents of their own recovery \r\nand summon greater political will for preventing and \r\nending the wars that have caused so much suffering. \r\nMillions of people need humanitarian help, and millions \r\nmore have been forcibly displaced from their homes. \r\nWe must set the right tone in addressing the lingering \r\nchallenges facing our world. My delegation endorses \r\nthe Assembly’s adoption of the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) and fully \r\nsubscribes to its call to address the root causes of the \r\nproblem, including efforts aimed at preventing crisis \r\nsituations before they erupt.\r\nSierra Leone also welcomes the simultaneous \r\nadoptions in April by the Security Council of its \r\nresolution 2282 (2016) on post-conflict peacebuilding, \r\nand by the General Assembly of its resolution \r\n70/262, reviewing the United Nations peacebuilding \r\narchitecture. The parallel resolutions demonstrate \r\nour commitment to take a comprehensive approach to \r\ntransitional justice and to accountability in the security \r\nsector, both of which are critical to consolidating \r\npeace, reducing poverty and preventing countries from \r\nrelapsing into conflict.\r\nIn Sierra Leone, our commitment to continue to \r\naddress the key underlying causes of fragility and the \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 7/46\r\ndrivers of conflict is underlined by our participation \r\nas a pilot country in the New Deal for Engagement in \r\nFragile States. As the current Chair of the Group of \r\nSeven Fragile States Plus, Sierra Leone emphasizes the \r\nimportance of incorporating SDG 16 into our efforts. \r\nWe also recognize that the effective management of \r\nour natural resources is central to ensuring sustainable \r\nsocioeconomic development and a resilient future for \r\nSierra Leoneans.\r\nMy Government remains committed to good \r\ngovernance and will continue to build on our post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding and democratic gains by further \r\nstrengthening our democratic institutions and by \r\nproviding access to the justice sector and establishing a \r\nlevel playing field there. To that end, we have taken steps \r\nto improve the conditions of service in our justice sector \r\nin order to attract and deploy more qualified personnel \r\nto the bench and as state counsels in every region and \r\ndistrict of Sierra Leone. We have established a legal-aid \r\nboard so as to ensure that every indigent person has \r\nlegal representation, that no one enters our correctional \r\ninstitutions without an indictment, and that court cases \r\nare speedily heard and justice is fairly served. Those \r\nstrides represent important contributions to our journey \r\ntowards attaining a resilient and inclusive Sierra Leone. \r\nThey remain the bedrock of our aspirations to become a \r\nmiddle-income country by 2035.\r\nThat is why we have hastened to put in place major \r\nrelevant policy decisions and enacted appropriate \r\nlegislation to empower women, improve the situation \r\nof youth and ensure that the physically challenged \r\nare not marginalized. My Government’s vision for \r\nthe empowerment of women as enshrined in pillar 8 \r\nof our Agenda for Prosperity is consistent with global \r\naspirations, in recognition of the crucial importance of \r\nwomen and gender parity in our development process. \r\nMost of my Government’s programmes are youth-\r\noriented and range from education to health, community \r\ndevelopment and employment.\r\nEfforts to address youth empowerment and \r\nunemployment remain at the heart of our Agenda for \r\nProsperity. My Government has also made a record \r\nnumber of appointments of youths and women into top-\r\nlevel decision-making positions, including ministerial, \r\nambassadorial and leadership posts in Government \r\ndepartments and agencies and in the military, police, \r\nParliament, the judiciary and local government.\r\nThe Ebola outbreak in West Africa shone a \r\nspotlight on the critical need for the world to have a \r\nmore robust and effective global health architecture, \r\nwith strong and accountable leadership to deal with \r\nhealth crises, including pandemics. In this context, \r\nmy delegation commends the High-Level Panel on the \r\nGlobal Response to Health Crises for its comprehensive \r\nreport. We strongly consider its 27 recommendations as \r\nthe way forward for appropriate action at the national, \r\nregional and international levels. We must collectively \r\ncommit ourselves to the full implementation of the \r\nPanel’s recommendations in order to protect humankind \r\nfrom the scourge of future health crises.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nSierra Leone, let me express our appreciation to the \r\ninternational community for supporting us in our efforts \r\nto defeat the Ebola virus. We are now implementing \r\nour post-Ebola recovery programme. We applaud the \r\nsupport that we have received, but we still face enormous \r\nresource gaps. I would therefore like to remind our \r\nbilateral friends and the international community to \r\nfulfil their pledges to our recovery programme.\r\nThough we contribute almost nothing to global \r\nwarming, Sierra Leone is the third most vulnerable \r\ncountry to the effects of climate change. Dealing \r\nwith climate change is therefore an urgent life-and-\r\ndeath matter for us. That is why we welcome the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, and we will implement \r\nits provisions in Sierra Leone. My Government, \r\nin collaboration with our development partners, \r\nis implementing projects on adaptation, including \r\nclimate information and early-warning systems. \r\nWe remain committed to these efforts, and we seek \r\nfurther collaboration in confronting this global threat \r\nagainst humankind.\r\nAs we move into the implementation of the first \r\nphase of the SDGs, we must remember that fragile \r\nStates were unable to make remarkable progress in \r\nthe implementation of the MDGs largely owing to the \r\nabsence of peace, justice and effective State institutions. \r\nIt is therefore urgent for all parties to cooperate with \r\nglobal initiatives in finding enduring peace in Syria, \r\nSouth Sudan and Libya. This is why the world must \r\naccelerate its efforts to resolve the Israeli-Palestinian \r\nconflict, in fighting terrorism and in stemming the \r\ndangerous escalation in the arms race.\r\nWe cannot sustain this world with bombs and the \r\nunending threat of war. We cannot achieve a universal \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n8/46 16-29553\r\npush towards development when armed conflicts \r\ncontinue to drive millions into refugee camps and when \r\nmillions find themselves trapped between warring \r\nfactions. We cannot champion the cause of justice and \r\nlegitimacy when Africa remains excluded from and \r\nunderrepresented in the highest decision-making organ \r\nof our global Organization. The reforms must start \r\nhere, and they must be deliberate and enduring.\r\nWhile we acknowledge the gradual progress made \r\nso far, particularly in the transparent process of selecting \r\nand appointing the next Secretary-General, let me again \r\nreiterate that African Member States are unhappy about \r\nthe slow pace of Security Council reform.\r\nIn concluding, let me once again reiterate Africa’s \r\nstrong concern over the continuous failure of the \r\nUnited Nations to adopt measures, including text-based \r\nnegotiations, that will lead to a comprehensive and early \r\nreform of the Security Council to reflect contemporary \r\nrealities. I would therefore urge that the reform process \r\nmove faster so that Africa can take its rightful place \r\nin the Security Council. The United Nations must \r\nchange with the times and must do so by effecting the \r\nrelevant reforms.\r\nRedressing the much-acknowledged historical \r\ninjustice done to the continent will be a remarkable step \r\nin our universal push to transform our world. We cannot \r\neffectively deal with the evolving challenges of our time \r\nif we continue to hold on to the edicts and structures \r\nestablished 71 years ago. Equitable geographical \r\nrepresentation, with the attendant privileges in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council, will only make it \r\nmore legitimate, representative, effective, transparent \r\nand accountable.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Sierra Leone for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the Republic \r\nof Sierra Leone, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Lithuania.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations Her Excellency \r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic of \r\nLithuania, and to invite her to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Grybauskaitė (Lithuania): This year \r\nwe agreed that the general debate would aim to give \r\na universal push to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. I would like to focus on the particularly \r\nimportant Sustainable Development Goal 5 — on \r\nachieving gender equality and empowering all women \r\nand girls — because today’s greatest challenges, \r\nfrom climate change to fighting terrorism to ending \r\nthe world’s deadliest conflicts, can be resolved only \r\nwith the full participation of both genders, especially \r\nwomen. Further, the successful implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals will require that we \r\ndedicate special attention to women, because they are \r\nthe ones who feel the greatest impacts and are most \r\nlikely to be left behind and ignored. Let us look at some \r\nof the other Sustainable Development Goals to see the \r\ntruth of this assertion.\r\nFirst, with respect to Goal 1 — ending \r\npoverty — both women and men are affected, but \r\nlifting women out of poverty is much more difficult. \r\nAs if poverty were not hard enough, women also face \r\ngender-based discrimination, stereotyping and social \r\nmarginalization. According to one UN-Women report, \r\naround the world, a woman earns approximately 24 per \r\ncent less than a man, finds it more difficult to get a loan \r\nto start a business, and is likely to receive a smaller \r\ninheritance or nothing if she decides to leave her \r\nhusband. The trend towards the feminization of poverty \r\nhas to be changed. By not allowing women to prosper, \r\nwe condemn entire families and all of society.\r\nSecondly, with respect to Goal 2 — ending \r\nhunger — although around half of the world’s agricultural \r\nwork is done by women, when food runs out women \r\nare the first to suffer. When public order breaks down, \r\na woman’s trip to bring her family food or water may \r\neasily cause her to lose her life. In times of hunger, \r\nwomen give the little food they have to their families \r\nand children. In a bread line, however, they often end \r\nup being pushed aside or abused. Empowering women \r\nby expanding land ownership or providing credit would \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 9/46\r\nnot only feed a family, but would also raise female \r\nincomes and make more food available for all.\r\nThirdly, with respect to Goal 4 — providing \r\neducation — for so many girls and women around the \r\nworld, following the road to inclusive learning and \r\neducation remains an impossible task. According to \r\nthe United Nations Global Sustainable Development \r\nReport, out of the world’s 750 million illiterate adults, \r\ntwo thirds are women. Girls are sent off or sold into \r\nearly marriages, which blocks their path to education, \r\nhigher income and independence. Criminals abduct \r\nwomen and sell them into slavery. Extremists burn \r\ndown schools and kill teachers because they do not \r\nwant educated girls to make their own decisions or \r\nmake their own life choices.\r\nNaturally, that needs to change. Education is a \r\nkey that opens many doors. Educated women are a \r\ntremendous resource and a force for the common \r\ngood for all of us. Women must be free to have access \r\nto education and choose the profession they want. \r\nInformation technologies must be available to uncover \r\ntheir full potential.\r\nThe task ahead of us is immense. However, it \r\ncan be achieved if each of us finds the strength and \r\ncourage to become part of the change by encouraging \r\nwomen to dream big and demand their rightful place in \r\nnational parliaments, in politics, at negotiating tables, \r\nin science labs and on company boards; by ensuring \r\nthat nothing can stand in the way of a girl’s dream to \r\nreceive a free high-quality education; by combating \r\ngender stereotypes and abusive social practices; and by \r\nmaking sure that life and laws give women and girls the \r\nequal voice and power that they deserve.\r\nThere is a new perspective to consider today. If \r\nwe reduce the cost of gender-based violence today \r\nwe can save the world about 2 per cent of lost gross \r\nnational product. If this money were not lost, it could \r\nbe directed into poverty reduction and development. \r\nIt is an additional development resource for the world. \r\nWe cannot afford to fail in this challenge. It is too \r\ncostly to allow gender-based violence to exist. To this \r\nend, we need everyone on board because only if all \r\nmembers of society — both women and men — are \r\nfully represented and engaged can the world’s future be \r\ntruly sustainable. Indeed, without it we cannot think at \r\nall about sustainable development in the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Lithuania for the statement \r\nshe has just made.\r\nMrs. Dalia Grybauskaitė, President of the Republic \r\nof Lithuania, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Salvador \r\nSánchez Cerén, President of the Republic of El Salvador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sánchez Cerén (El Salvador) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): At the outset, I would like to affirm El \r\nSalvador’s highest and most decisive commitment to \r\nmeeting and endorsing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and its 17 Goals at the international level \r\nin order to make our country and the world a better \r\nplace for its inhabitants.\r\nNine months ago, El Salvador became the first \r\ncountry in the world to sign a ground-breaking \r\nagreement with the United Nations system for long-\r\nterm cooperation on the accelerated implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in 15 \r\nnations around the world. Our objective, as partners \r\nin this ambitious initiative, is to make sustainable our \r\ncountry’s efforts aimed at fulfilling the Agenda.\r\nTaking into account the deadline to achieve the \r\nSDGs, we have accordingly developed strategies in \r\nour five-year development plan, entitled “El Salvador: \r\nproductive, educated and safe”. Within the framework \r\nof that joint effort with the United Nations, it is essential \r\nto empower a diversity of actors in the implementation \r\nprocess. To that end, we are establishing the National \r\nCouncil for Sustainable Development, a joint mechanism \r\nbetween Government and civil society charged with \r\nconsulting, arranging and coordinating implementation \r\nof the SDGs at the national level.\r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n10/46 16-29553\r\nIn El Salvador, we are convinced that the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals must become an agenda for society. \r\nThey must become a vision and shared programme \r\nbetween Government, citizens, social organizations, \r\nchurches, business people, universities and other \r\npillars of society. Of course, we in the Government \r\nare the first who are called upon to show progress in \r\nimplementing the Agenda. We are therefore working \r\ntowards increasing the productive capacity of our \r\ncountry through creating an environment for greater \r\nprivate and public investment, supporting micro-, \r\nsmall and medium enterprises, raising the quality of \r\neducation, and implementing special projects to support \r\nvulnerable groups, such as young people, women and \r\nrural populations, to create opportunities, employment \r\nand economic growth for them.\r\nWith regard to security, to achieve its goals and \r\novercome its challenges, my Government is committed \r\nto reaching an agreement with all political parties, \r\naimed positively at working together to resolve the short-\r\nterm and tax problems that we are facing as a country. \r\nFurthermore, we are carrying out unprecedented efforts \r\nin the area of security, as we had set out to do a year \r\nago when we adopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which states,\r\n“[s]ustainable development cannot be realized \r\nwithout peace and security; and peace and security \r\nwill be at risk without sustainable development” \r\n(resolution 70/1, para. 35).\r\nIn that context, I want to share with the Assembly \r\nthe fact that the National Council on Citizen Security \r\nand Coexistence, involving all social and political \r\nsectors and stakeholders in the country, is moving \r\nforward with the implementation of the Plan for a Safe \r\nEl Salvador in order to take steps to reduce all forms of \r\nviolence and activities committed by criminal groups, \r\nsuch as gangs and traffickers in humans, weapons \r\nand drugs, which have brought so much suffering to \r\nour people. We have also undertaken extraordinary \r\nmeasures to prevent violence, which will be gradually \r\nexpanded throughout the entire country once they \r\nhave been implemented in priority municipalities. The \r\nactions carried out in the various aspects of the Plan \r\nfor a Safe El Salvador has yielded results. Over the \r\npast five months, there has been an approximate 50 per \r\ncent reduction in homicides, as compared with the first \r\nthree months of this year — although, of course, many \r\nchallenges and difficulties lie ahead.\r\nI wish to reiterate that the Government of El \r\nSalvador remains fully committed to ensuring and \r\nprotecting human rights. The commitment to human \r\nrights, democracy, the separation of powers, respect \r\nfor the mandates of every State body and its decisions, \r\ntransparency and the fight against corruption are today, \r\nfor the Government of El Salvador, the cornerstone of \r\nany action it undertakes.\r\nI recall that my country promoted the recognition \r\nin resolution 70/1, adopted at the United Nations \r\nSustainable Development Summit, that migrants are \r\na vulnerable group and that they incontrovertibly \r\ncontribute to the economic development of the countries \r\nthat receive them. El Salvador insists on the need for the \r\ninternational community and the organizations dealing \r\nwith the immigration issue and defending the rights of \r\nmigrants and human rights, in general, and in particular \r\nthe United Nations, to meet the challenge with courage \r\nand guide the efforts of their agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes to reinforce cooperation initiatives related \r\nto international migration in all its facets.\r\nMigration is a multidimensional phenomenon. It is \r\nas old as the history of humankind. In the particular \r\ncase of my country, we are aware of the factors that \r\nmotivate many Salvadorans to emigrate. National \r\nand other regional initiatives, such as the Plan of the \r\nAlliance for Prosperity in the Northern Triangle, which \r\nwe are implementing with Guatemala and Honduras, in \r\ncooperation with the United States of America, focus \r\non key priorities, such as productive development, \r\ninvestment in human capital, security and the \r\nstrengthening of institutions. As countries of origin, \r\nwe are doing our part, but we also need the rights of \r\nour citizens in countries of transit and destination to \r\nbe supported and, above all, ensured. In other words, \r\nonly efforts aimed at improving the conditions within \r\nthe communities of origin of migrant populations will \r\nchange the situation in the medium and long term. As \r\nthe Pope said in September last year, the wall is not a \r\nsolution because it would only produce more hate.\r\nThere is no doubt that the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security is an absolute \r\nprerequisite for fulfilling the 2030 Agenda. It is therefore \r\nessential to reiterate that the threat to humankind \r\nposed by the continued existence of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction is a cause for concern, and restate that \r\ntheir use or the threat of their use is a clear violation of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and a crime against \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 11/46\r\nhumanity, constituting a clear violation of international \r\nlaw and international humanitarian law.\r\nIn addition, we note with concern the attempts made \r\nto destabilize progressive Governments in our region, \r\nincluding the removal during her term of the President \r\nelected by the people of Brazil. Such practices are not \r\nonly an affront to the rule of law, but also seriously \r\nhamper democracy, peace and the development of \r\nnations. We therefore stand against such measures. \r\nWe call upon the international community to remain \r\nvigilant with regard to such actions and stay the course.\r\nIn that context, I would like to express particular \r\nsolidarity with President Nicolás Maduro Moros and \r\nthe Venezuelan people, who, I trust, will find solutions \r\nthrough dialogue to the challenges facing them.\r\nSimilarly, our country firmly rejects any expression \r\nof intolerance, violence and terror by radical groups \r\nthat are attacking the lives and the most fundamental \r\nrights of people — a phenomenon that has been striking \r\nvarious parts of the world over the past several years.\r\nEl Salvador, as a country that suffered from a \r\ncivil war and the consequences of the Cold War, is \r\nparticularly concerned about the conflict in Syria, \r\nwhich has been worsening and has had a disastrous \r\nimpact on the country’s entire social fabric, in particular \r\nfor its children. It is crucial that the global leadership \r\nrepresented in this Hall, in particular from countries \r\nhosting refugees from the crisis, provide a coordinated \r\nand, above all, humane and united response for the \r\nfamilies who are suffering from deracination, disease \r\nand the loss of their loved ones as a result of the war.\r\nWe also hope that the different sectors in Syria \r\nwill, with the support of the international community \r\nand United Nations institutions, reach an agreement to \r\nput an end to the hostilities in its territory. We would \r\nalso like to speak out for the other areas of the world, \r\nsuch as Palestine, Iraq and Libya, where it is urgent that \r\nconflicts be overcome and a stable peace achieved.\r\nIn the Americas, we have noted with satisfaction \r\nthe progress made by Cuba and the United States in \r\nrestoring their relations. However, we believe that \r\nthis change will not bring the expected benefits to the \r\npeople of both countries if the economic embargo is not \r\nbrought to an end.\r\nIt is important to underscore the decisive role played \r\nby the United Nations in defending and promoting \r\nhuman rights worldwide, as well as in promoting \r\ninternational peace and security. That is why I want to \r\nthank the valuable support that the Organization has \r\nprovided to El Salvador over the past 25 years, not only \r\nto improve the quality of life of Salvadorans, through \r\nthe implementation of international cooperation \r\nprogrammes and projects, but also in other areas, such \r\nas strengthening democracy and the rule of law, inter \r\nalia. This shared vision came about thanks to the fact \r\nthat El Salvador resolved the armed conflict of the \r\n1980s through an intensive dialogue and negotiation \r\nprocess, which culminated in the signing of the Peace \r\nAgreement on 16 January 1992, for which we had the \r\ninvaluable support of the United Nations.\r\nAllow me to underscore the fact that this is not \r\nonly a historic milestone for El Salvador, but also \r\na successful example of the workings of the United \r\nNations system and can serve as a reference for \r\nresolving other conflicts. Accordingly, El Salvador has \r\nexpressed its willingness to share its experience, as \r\nit did in the case of Colombia, which recently signed \r\nits definitive pact for peace and is implementing the \r\nagreements reached. We recognize and congratulate \r\nColombia on this achievement.\r\nI wish to state that El Salvador is preparing to \r\ncelebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Peace \r\nAgreement in January 2017. With the support of the \r\nUnited Nations, this will be an opportunity to once again \r\nstrengthen the process of defining our national agenda \r\nwhich we have been working on with a view to deepening \r\nour goals. Looking ahead, El Salvador recognizes that \r\nthe challenge of building a culture of peace goes hand \r\nin hand with a sustainable development agenda. As we \r\nsee it, we cannot achieve sustainable development and \r\ndemocracy without peace, nor can we achieve peace \r\nwithout democracy and sustainable development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran.\r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n12/46 16-29553\r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rouhani (spoke in Farsi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I congratulate \r\nMr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session, and \r\nI hope that the decisions and initiatives taken by the \r\nAssembly will play an effective role in resolving the \r\nproblems that our world is currently facing.\r\nFifteen years have passed since the painful terrorist \r\nattack in this city, a disaster whose human dimensions \r\nmoved the entire world. On that day, no one imagined \r\nthat this occurrence would lead to larger disasters or \r\nresult in a devastating war in the Middle East and the \r\nspread of insecurity across the globe. This war has \r\nsown the seeds of borderless terrorism everywhere \r\non Earth. Today, the most pressing question as to why \r\nwe are facing such a situation should be on the agenda \r\nof every international forum. We need to find out \r\nwhich approaches, policies and erroneous actions have \r\npaved the way for the spread of insecurity throughout \r\nthe world and what the world will look like 15 years \r\nfrom now.\r\nSecurity has become a global problem at a \r\ntime when major Powers are mainly focusing on \r\nadvancing different methods of repression and military \r\nintervention under the pretext of creating a secure \r\nenvironment for their citizens. The genesis of borderless \r\nviolent extremism and terrorism could be attributed to \r\nthe security strategies developed by major Powers in \r\nthe past 15 years. The main lesson to be learned from \r\nthe analysis of this trend is that security in one region \r\nat the cost of insecurity in others is not only impossible, \r\nbut it also leads to greater insecurity everywhere. \r\nTerrorists have even gone as far as claiming to have \r\nestablished States in the Levant, Iraq and Libya. More \r\nunfortunately, they hide their nefarious intents behind \r\nreligious literature, thereby turning a compassionate \r\nreligion into an instrument of violence and terror by \r\nspreading extremist and takfiri propaganda, which is \r\nall too regrettable.\r\nThe century that began with terror and violence in \r\nNew York should not continue with hostile competition \r\nand expanding conflicts in the Middle East. Today the \r\ndiscourse of hatred and violence in the Middle East \r\nand North Africa is spreading with astonishing speed. \r\nThe region is caught in a web of the most savage and \r\ndestructive of policies. Millions of Syrians are stranded \r\nin deserts or on high seas, and hundreds of thousands of \r\nthem die a violent death. Iraqis of every ethnic group are \r\nconcerned about their territorial integrity and the future \r\nof their homeland. The defenceless people of Yemen \r\nare subjected to daily aerial bombardments. Following \r\ndecades of occupation and atrocities, Afghanistan has \r\nyet to be released from the grip of suffering, violence \r\nand terror. The oppressed Palestinians continue to be \r\naff licted by the apartheid policies and atrocities set by \r\nthe usurping Zionist regime.\r\nUndoubtedly, if the region is to reverse the current \r\ndangerous trends and move towards development and \r\nstability, certain countries must stop bombing their \r\nneighbours and abandon their support for takfiri \r\nterrorist groups, while accepting responsibility and \r\ntrying to compensate for past mistakes. If the Saudi \r\nGovernment is serious about its vision for development \r\nand regional security, it must cease and desist from the \r\nuse of divisive policies, stop spreading hate ideology and \r\nrefrain from trampling upon the rights of neighbours. \r\nIt must accept its responsibility for the protection of \r\nthe lives and dignity of pilgrims and construct relations \r\nwith the nations in the region on the basis of mutual \r\nrespect and accountability.\r\nThe future of our region rests on dealing with \r\nfundamental challenges, including security crises. Due \r\nto inefficiency and lack of Government legitimacy, \r\nwe will not be able to combat criminal and terrorist \r\nnetworks without genuine democracy or a participatory \r\napproach at national and transnational levels. We believe \r\nthat countries in our region can create a shared future \r\non the basis of their common history and culture and by \r\nisolating terrorist groups. We should never again allow \r\nour region to run the risk of dismemberment, given the \r\nimpact of what took place close to a century ago.\r\nIran’s principled approach calls for constructive \r\npartnership with our neighbours, with a view to \r\nestablishing an enduring order based on shared security \r\nand efforts aimed at enhancing the developments of \r\ncountries in the region and mutually beneficial economic \r\ncooperation. In order to uproot violence in the region \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 13/46\r\nthere is no choice but to focus on promoting democracy, \r\ncitizenship rights and economic development.\r\nIran opposes any kind of sectarianism and any \r\nattempt to promote religious divisions. For centuries, \r\nthe Muslim people, be they Shiites or Sunnis, have lived \r\nand continue to live together in harmony and mutual \r\nrespect. Attempts to turn religious dissimilarities into \r\ntense confrontations are rooted in the vested interests of \r\ncertain countries, which are trying to hide their quests \r\nfor power behind religious slogans. Iran considers it \r\nimperative to preserve the territorial integrity of States, \r\nkeep national borders intact, enhance people’s right to \r\nself-determination and uphold the principle of refraining \r\nfrom the threat or use of force. We also reiterate the \r\nneed to use diplomacy in conflict resolution.\r\nDespite today’s difficulties, I have hope in \r\ntomorrow. I have no doubt that we can prevail through \r\nprudence and wisdom. The experience acquired through \r\ndialogue between Iran and the P5+1 and the fruition of \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) are \r\nindicative of the success that we could achieve through \r\nmoderation, constructive interaction and the promotion \r\nof dialogue. A long, complicated and unnecessary \r\ncrisis was brought to an end by the adoption of a \r\nwin-win approach. The deal confirmed the peaceful \r\nnature of Iran’s nuclear programme through the use \r\nof confidence-building mechanisms and entails the \r\nclosure of the so-called possible military dimensions \r\nfile and the reinstatement of Iran’s right to develop a \r\npeaceful nuclear programme.\r\nThe deal also has put an end to unfounded \r\nconcerns, leading to the removal of the brutal sanctions \r\nimposed against Iran. Beyond the nuclear file, however, \r\nthe JCPOA holds important lessons the resolving \r\ncomplicated international problems. The deal is not \r\nonly a political agreement; it also represents a creative \r\napproach and method for engaging in constructive \r\ninteraction with a view to peacefully resolving crises \r\nand challenges. The lessons learned from the JCPOA \r\nwill serve to improve international relations. We \r\nshould never forget that these pressures, sanctions and \r\nillegal threats against the Iranian people, designed to \r\nfully dismantle Iran’s enrichment programme, were \r\nall defeated. Today, the Security Council and the \r\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency have formally \r\naccepted Iran’s peaceful nuclear programme.\r\nThe United States is fully aware that the JCPOA \r\nconstitutes a recognized multilateral agreement and \r\nthat any failure on the part of the United States in \r\nimplementing it would constitute an wrongful act under \r\ninternational law, to which the international community \r\nwould object. Any failure in the implementation of the \r\nJCPOA will further erode the credibility of the United \r\nStates around the world.\r\nBreaches in compliance with the JCPOA by the \r\nUnited States in the past several months represents an \r\nerror that should be rectified forthwith. Unfortunately, \r\nsuch illegal actions are not unprecedented. The latest \r\nexample of this is the recent United States Supreme \r\nCourt ruling which affirmed the legality of the seizure \r\nof billions of dollars in assets belonging to the Iranian \r\npeople. This experience demonstrates that Zionist \r\npressure groups could go so far as to persuade the \r\nUnited States Congress to pass indefensible legislation \r\nthat forces the highest American judicial institution to \r\nviolate peremptory norms of international law.\r\nWith God’s help, the Iranian people’s fortitude \r\nand the increased participation of Iran’s partners from \r\nvarious regions around the world, and only eight months \r\nafter the lifting of the cruel nuclear-related sanctions \r\nagainst my country, the economy of Iran, as the safest \r\nand most profitable destination for investment in our \r\nregion, is showing clear improvement. Iran’s economic \r\ngrowth rate surpassed 4 per cent in the spring of 2016, \r\nthe inflation rate dropped to single digits, and Iran has \r\ncome close to pre-sanction levels of oil production and \r\nexports. All in all, we are seeing greater development \r\nin the economic, scientific and technological sectors of \r\nthe country.\r\nIran is one of the rare oil-producing countries that \r\nmay be able to offset the shocking impact of the sharp \r\nslide in oil price in 2014. In order to attract investment, \r\nwe are intent on strengthening economic stability \r\nand consistency through economic reforms and fiscal \r\nand financial discipline while preserving low rates of \r\ninflation. Economic growth is set to increase to around \r\n5 per cent by the end of 2016. Based on all domestic and \r\ninternational predictions, Iran is currently enjoying one \r\nthe highest growth rates among oil-producing countries.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to clearly state that it \r\nis my deep belief that, despite setbacks, moderation \r\nwill prevail over extremism, peace will triumph over \r\nviolence, enlightenment will overcome ignorance \r\nand, finally, justice will conquer injustice. What is \r\nimportant is that we channel our beliefs, hopes and \r\nefforts towards realizing peace and justice. If we do so, \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n14/46 16-29553\r\nthere is no doubt that the Almighty will assist all those \r\nwho endeavour for peace, justice and moderation, and \r\nthat God will help those who assist Him by defending \r\nhis path, for the Lord is strong and mighty.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Hassan Rouhani, President of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Madagascar.\r\nMr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Hery Martial \r\nRajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana, President \r\nof the Republic of Madagascar, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana \r\n(spoke in French): At the outset, on behalf of the \r\ndelegation of the Republic of Madagascar that I lead, \r\nI congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession and wish him every success in presiding over \r\nthe work of the General Assembly during the current \r\nsession. At the same time, we would like to convey our \r\nheartfelt appreciation to his predecessor.\r\nBy submitting, together with 21 other countries, \r\na voluntary national review report in the framework \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nMadagascar reaffirms and solidifies the political \r\ncommitment it undertook when it signed on to the \r\nglobal mobilization last year which led to the adoption \r\nof the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. Those \r\nobjectives, which we all wanted to be universal, do \r\nnot apply only to developing or poor countries, but \r\nrather to all countries, adjusted to local realities and \r\ndevelopment differentials, because a sustainable world \r\ncan be built only upon an ecology-friendly transition \r\nin the North and responsible development in the South.\r\nThe hopes sparked by the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) are immense. Nevertheless, we must move \r\nfrom commitments to action and implementation. The \r\nmajor challenges are the redistribution of investments, \r\nimproving social justice and translating international \r\ncommitments into national strategies and political \r\naction. Human development, environmental protection \r\nand inclusive economies are the triptych that structures \r\nthe SDGs. They align with our national development \r\nplan. In order to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, Madagascar is promoting social protection. This \r\nyear, we formulated and implemented a national policy \r\nin that regard. By way of example, we provide income \r\nsupplements for the poorest households to support the \r\nintegration of children into the school system and to \r\nimprove their nutrition through school cafeterias.\r\nIn addition to the social protection I just mentioned, \r\nhealth and education are sectors that we hold dear. \r\nHealth is key for our country, as it is the best way to \r\nensure the productivity of our people, both at school and \r\nin the workplace. That is why the draft universal health-\r\ncoverage system was set up this year as part of our efforts \r\nto improve our public-health system. This policy will \r\nprovide heath-care solutions for our people, especially \r\nthe most vulnerable. Furthermore, the Government has \r\ncommitted itself to increasing vaccination coverage in \r\nMadagascar through a vaccination law. Other health-\r\nrelated efforts have been made with the United Nations \r\nin recent years, particularly in the fight against HIV/\r\nAIDS. In the education sector, we have been able to \r\nbegin recruiting and training tens of thousands of \r\nteachers in an attempt to raise the school attendance \r\nrate, to help school dropouts go back to school and to \r\nimprove the quality of our teaching.\r\nOur young people, women and girls are \r\nthe cornerstone of all of our public policies and \r\ndevelopment initiatives. Economic and social \r\ndevelopment, and, in particular, conditions for making \r\nthe world more stable will be in vain if priority is not \r\ngiven to young people. From this rostrum, I call on all \r\ncountries to collectively resolve to assist one another, in \r\norder to support development policies for young people. \r\nWe need to create jobs for them, develop their talents \r\nand meet their legitimate aspirations to contribute to \r\nworld peace and curb migration.\r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 15/46\r\nProtecting and empowering women and young \r\ngirls, ensuring their equal rights and gender parity in \r\ndevelopment participation and respecting the rights \r\nof children and young people are at the heart of our \r\nconcerns and our thinking. We will continue to reform \r\nour national plans and policies in order to promote equal \r\naccess for women and men to economic resources and \r\nbasic services. One notable achievement in Malagasy \r\nwomen’s rights was the reform of the nationality code to \r\nallow children born to a Malagasy mother and a foreign \r\nfather to acquire Malagasy citizenship through the \r\nmaternal line, irrespective of the father’s nationality. \r\nSimilarly, in the interest of being all inclusive, the \r\nratification of the international Convention on the \r\nRights of Persons with Disabilities has allowed us \r\nto improve the protection offered to people with \r\ndisabilities in Madagascar by implementing inclusive \r\npolicies that safeguard their interests and allow them to \r\neffectively participate in development.\r\nSustainable Development Goal 2 seeks to end hunger, \r\nachieve food security, improve nutrition and promote \r\nsustainable agriculture. Our ambition is to modernize \r\nour agriculture sector to increase productivity and \r\nfurther develop organic farming. That would ensure \r\nfood autonomy and accelerate the completion of the \r\nregional project of the Indian Ocean Commission to \r\ntransform Madagascar into the breadbasket of the \r\nregion. Programmes to combat food insecurity are part \r\nof our efforts to achieve the SDGs. Much of the south \r\nof the country is in the gripsof chronic drought, and the \r\npopulation living there is suffering greatly from critical \r\nfood insecurity. As a result, various activities are being \r\ncarried out to support the efforts of the Madagascan \r\nauthorities in the light of this critical situation.\r\nSustainable Development Goal 14 advocates \r\nconserving and sustainably using oceans, seas and \r\nmarine resources for sustainable development. The \r\nawareness of the need to diversify efforts beyond land-\r\nbased activities is nothing new. We support Africa’s \r\nstrategy, which is aimed at creating greater wealth \r\nby promoting a f lourishing blue economy that is \r\nsustainable, secure and respectful of the environment. \r\nWith this in mind and within the context of the Indian \r\nOcean Commission, a decision was taken to establish \r\nthe Regional Maritime Information Fusion Centre in \r\nMadagascar to prevent threats such as piracy, terrorism, \r\ntrafficking in its many forms and the plundering of \r\nnatural resources.\r\nBy signing the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange on 22 April and then ratifying it, Madagascar \r\nhas chosen to participate in the universal movement to \r\ntransform the world, thereby ensuring the future of our \r\nplanet — our sole and unique habitat. Madagascar is \r\none of the countries permanently suffering from the \r\ndevastating effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we \r\nadvocate responsible development that preserves the \r\nenvironment. In return, we expect an equal distribution \r\nof resources from the Green Climate Fund and the \r\ntransfer of relevant technologies. We must turn our back \r\non expensive, pollutant energy sources that endanger \r\nthe environment we share.\r\nMy country once again calls for the support of \r\nthe international community and private investors, \r\nin particular in the electricity-production sector and \r\nin the renovation and expansion of water-distribution \r\ninfrastructures. These are real investment opportunities. \r\nIndeed, if we wish to breathe new life into our planet \r\nfor the well-being of its population and for the benefit \r\nof future generations, we must successfully ensure the \r\ntransition to new kinds of energy at the national and \r\nglobal levels. We also wish to promote ethical tourism \r\nthat respects the environment, our ecosystems and \r\nour culture.\r\nToday, I wish to launch an appeal for the transfer \r\nof more technology and capital to countries that \r\ndemonstrate strong potential, such as Madagascar. For \r\nour part, we commit to practicing good governance and \r\ntransparency in the context of a win-win partnership. \r\nBoth direct foreign investment and overseas \r\ndevelopment aid are valuable support mechanisms that \r\nwe should channel in the best possible way and manage \r\neffectively in order to achieve the SDGs. That is why \r\nmy country will invite our partners and international \r\ninvestors to Paris next December for a donor and \r\ninvestor conference in order to mobilize the resources \r\nwe need for our development programme.\r\nSeventy-one years following the creation of our \r\nOrganization, we must acknowledge that much remains \r\nto be done in a world where we adjust far too quickly \r\nto misery, poverty and the precarious nature of life, \r\nwhere far too quickly we accept injustice and persistent \r\ninequality, conflict, crisis and even war. However, we \r\nmust admit that the United Nations has documented \r\nmajor achievements and progress over the years. We \r\nremain firmly convinced that the United Nations \r\ntoday embodies a universal conscience recognized \r\nand respected by the international order, as well as \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n16/46 16-29553\r\npolitical will at the global level. It is a forum where \r\nnations can come to plead and explain their cause to \r\nthe rest of the world. The most important thing is the \r\nrespect of and follow-up to commitments, which is key \r\nto building trust.\r\nOn 17 June in Paris, upon the initiative of the French \r\nauthorities, we restarted negotiations concerning the \r\nMalagasy islands of Glorieuses, Juan de Nova, Europa \r\nand Bassas da India, the latter three located in the \r\nMozambique Channel. Madagascar is delighted at the \r\ninitiative, which from our point of view is in line with \r\nthe implementation of the relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions. In paragraph 3 of resolution 34/91, of \r\n12 December 1979, the Assembly\r\n“[i]nvites the Government of France to \r\ninitiate negotiations without further delay with the \r\nGovernment of Madagascar for the reintegration of \r\nthe above-mentioned islands, which were arbitrarily \r\nseparated from Madagascar”.\r\nResolution 35/123, of 11 December 1980, supplements \r\nthe 1979 resolution as it\r\n“[i]nvites the Government of France to initiate \r\nwith the Government of Madagascar, as a matter of \r\nurgency, the negotiations provided for in resolution \r\n34/91, with a view to settling the question in \r\naccordance with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations” (resolution 35/123, \r\npara. 4).\r\nMadagascar would hope that the discussions that \r\nhave been started will take place in full respect of the \r\nprovisions of the Manila Declaration on the settlement \r\nof international disputes, enshrined in resolution 37/10, \r\nof 15 November 1982. The resolution underscores, inter \r\nalia, the obligations stemming from the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law concerning the \r\nsovereignty, independence and territorial integrity \r\nof States as well as the other generally recognized \r\nprinciples and norms of contemporary international law.\r\nOn matters of peace and security, I wish to reiterate \r\nmy Government’s gratitude to the United Nations and to \r\nthe Peacebuilding Support Office, which agreed to the \r\nPeacebuilding Fund for Madagascar at the end of 2014. \r\nThis year marks the operational phase of the Fund’s \r\npriority plan, focusing on two main projects: support \r\nfor reform of the security sector and for governance \r\nin Madagascar.\r\nIn the past 10 years, one man in particular has held \r\nhigh the torch of the United Nations and championed \r\nthe values and principles that we all share. As I conclude \r\nmy statement, I wish to pay well-deserved tribute to \r\nour dear Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose \r\nmandate is coming to an end this year. His commitment \r\nto peace and development throughout the world, his \r\npersonal commitment and the way in which he has \r\nheaded this Organization have earned our gratitude, \r\nesteem and respect.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Madagascar for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina \r\nRakotoarimanana, President of the Republic \r\nof Madagascar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nImmigration of the Republic of Kiribati\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President, \r\nHead of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Immigration of the Republic of Kiribati.\r\nMr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration of \r\nthe Republic of Kiribati, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Maamau: I am very pleased to address, \r\nfor the first time, this global family of ours at its \r\nseventy-first gathering, on behalf of the Government \r\nand the people of Kiribati.\r\nI join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nPresident Peter Thomson on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. I am particularly proud to see a Pacific \r\nbrother leading this body during this critical period of \r\ntransformation. I have every confidence that with his \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 17/46\r\nable leadership and Pacific wisdom, he will be able to \r\nguide us through these challenging times. He can be \r\nassured of our full support and cooperation.\r\nI also join colleagues in acknowledging with \r\nappreciation the commendable leadership of his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, in \r\nguiding our work during the seventieth session and in \r\nfacilitating the implementation of the new 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\nThis is a transitional period for us all. I am very \r\nhappy that my first general debate coincides with the \r\nassumption of the Pacific to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. I am quite sad, though, that this is the \r\nlast general debate of our beloved Secretary-General. \r\nI have read about and observed the untiring service \r\nthat our Secretary-General has given humankind and \r\nhis personal unwavering commitment and passion \r\nin focusing global attention on the most vulnerable, \r\nparticularly the small and low-lying island countries as \r\nwell as the communities on the front line of the many \r\nmajor challenges facing us today as a global family.\r\nI am so proud to say that Mr. Ban Ki-moon is the \r\nfirst Secretary-General to ever have visited my country \r\nand our part of the world in the Pacific in the 71 years \r\nof the existence of this premier global body. This is a \r\nvery rare opportunity, and I would like to personally \r\nthank and commend Mr. Ban Ki-moon for having taken \r\nthat bold initiative. It is my sincere hope that the next \r\nvisit of our Secretary-General to my country and the \r\nPacific will be soon, not 60 or 70 years from now. This \r\nwill be part of the transformation that we expect from \r\nour United Nations family.\r\nAllow me, on this note, to acknowledge and \r\ncommend, with heartfelt gratitude, the sterling \r\nleadership of our Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon. I \r\nthank and commend him for being a steadfast advocate \r\nfor and the voice of the voiceless. I thank and commend \r\nhim for instilling our United Nations family and \r\nreaffirming an inclusive culture that ensures that no \r\none is left behind. The legacy he will leave is enshrined \r\nin the new sustainable development Agenda and in the \r\nParis Agreement, the catalyst for global attention and \r\naction on climate change.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of \r\nKiribati, I wish our Secretary-General the very best \r\nas he concludes his term as head of this global family \r\nof ours and as he takes on the next challenge in his \r\nunwavering service to humankind.\r\nWe meet at a very critical time in our history. The \r\nchallenges facing us as we gather at this session are \r\nperhaps greater than when we met a year ago. We note \r\nwith grave concern the increasing security challenges \r\nfacing our global family, from conflicts around the \r\nworld, the scourge of terrorism, transnational organized \r\ncrime, war and nuclear testing, mass movements \r\nof refugees and migrants, to the often unstated but \r\ninvisible silent killer, the non-communicable diseases, \r\nthe health of our oceans and other looming challenges \r\nand uncertainties, some with incremental but very \r\nreal existential threats such as climate change. These \r\ncontinue to undermine our efforts as a global family to \r\nachieve sustainable development.\r\nI would also like to add that the new session provides \r\na great opportunity for all of us — an opportunity to \r\nreaffirm and renew our commitment to our people and \r\nour planet. This is an opportunity to achieve peace \r\nand prosperity for all through genuine partnerships, \r\nto consolidate our efforts and resources in order to \r\naddress the challenges we face, and to realize our vision \r\nfor bringing about an inclusive world. As leaders, it is \r\nour opportunity to deliver on our commitments. We \r\nhave a moral responsibility to do that, and we must do \r\nso forthwith.\r\nThe theme of this session — “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform \r\nour world” — is a timely and appropriate one. For if \r\nwe are to address the challenges we face and realize \r\nthe opportunities available to us, we must change \r\nour mindset, our path and our ways. And we must do \r\nthis together.\r\nClimate change is a global challenge that requires \r\nuniversal transformation. We simply cannot afford to \r\ncontinue with business as usual. The future of those \r\nof us who are most vulnerable, such as my people and \r\nmy country, is at stake. We need major changes in the \r\nglobal mindset, the global development pathways and \r\nthe ways we do business. We must do this if we are to \r\nsecure the future of my people and those who share the \r\nsame fate, and to ensure that we are not left behind.\r\nEvery year, my country comes to this family \r\ngathering with constant cries for help in stopping the \r\nmomentum of global warming and in assisting countries \r\nlike mine to adapt to the adverse impact of climate \r\nchange. It is distressing to see our people continuing to \r\nfight the effects of the onslaught of sea-level rises, storm \r\nsurges and disasters such as Cyclone Pam and Cyclone \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n18/46 16-29553\r\nWinston on their homes, farmland and livelihood, their \r\nheritage and their critical source of water. And I must \r\nsay that the increasing frequency and severity of such \r\nevents has exacerbated their heartbreaking impact on \r\nour people.\r\nIn some parts of our country, whole villages have \r\nhad to be relocated because of severe coastal erosion \r\nand f looding. Food crops have been destroyed. Our \r\nfreshwater lenses, our major source of drinking water, \r\nare being increasingly contaminated by intruding \r\nseawater. As we enter the La Niña period, with drought \r\nforecast for our country, water scarcity is already an \r\nissue for our people in both urban and rural areas, which \r\nhas the potential to trigger other risks, for example, to \r\nsanitation, health and education. Kiribati is closely \r\nmonitoring the situation and is seriously considering the \r\nimmediate options for ensuring our people’s survival.\r\nWe urgently call for assistance from our United \r\nNations family and its members, asking them to look \r\ninto their hearts and help us address this looming, \r\nlife-threatening issue as soon as possible. This is \r\nan issue that cannot wait for the Paris Agreement \r\nratification process to happen. I came here straight \r\nfrom a meeting of our Parliament that was held because \r\nmy people, especially our younger generation, are \r\nunremittingly protesting the increasing intensity of the \r\neffects of climate change. They are demanding swift \r\naction right now, without procrastination.\r\nThe adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange last year gave humankind a sense of hope, \r\nembodying the global consensus that climate change is \r\nhappening and must be resolved as soon as possible. It \r\nis a major first step in global action to counter climate \r\nchange. The next challenge is to ensure the Agreement’s \r\nearly entry into force. In this regard, I am pleased to \r\nsay that following our signing of the Paris Agreement \r\nin April, I had the honour yesterday of depositing my \r\ncountry’s instrument of ratification during the high-\r\nlevel event for the entry into force of the Agreement. \r\nWe are fully committed to the Agreement and to all \r\nclimate-related undertakings aimed at ensuring that \r\nour global family addresses the root causes and impacts \r\nof climate change.\r\nThe suffering of our people must stop now. The \r\nParis Agreement will not only help us address our \r\nchallenges as a low-lying atoll nation already on \r\nthe front line; it can also save others on the way to \r\nincreasing vulnerability from ending up on the front \r\nline in the future. I commend our bigger brothers in our \r\nglobal family, notably China and the United States, for \r\ntheir commitment to this process. I urge the rest of our \r\nUnited Nations family to join them and help save those \r\nwho urgently require immediate support and action \r\nto make it happen. This is an opportunity for us as \r\nleaders to push for an early entry into force of the Paris \r\nAgreement and transform our world for our generation \r\nand, more importantly, for future generations.\r\nThis is an opportunity for us to take care of one \r\nanother. And we must do it together, as a family. There \r\nis a huge risk of being left behind for low-lying island \r\nnations such as mine — Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands, \r\nTokelau, Tonga, the Maldives and countless others \r\nwhose peoples live in coastal areas prone to drought, \r\ndesertification, f looding and typhoons.\r\nThe global challenges facing our people, especially \r\nthe most vulnerable, continue to test our humanity, \r\nlove and compassion, which are powerful ingredients \r\nfor achieving the global transformation that can lead \r\nto the future we all want. If we fail to achieve this \r\ntransformation, we will be failing the people who look \r\nto us for leadership in improving their quality of life \r\nand securing a future for them, their children and their \r\nchildren’s children.\r\nThe President opened this session of the Assembly \r\nwith his grandchildren by his side. It was a moving and \r\nsignificant moment, reminding all of us of our most \r\nimportant constituents, our children and their children. \r\nIn his opening statement, he rightly said that it is our \r\ncall to make, because if we fail, we have failed our \r\ngrandchildren. As a leader and a grandfather, I am fully \r\ncommitted to serving and delivering to all the children \r\nand grandchildren of our global family.\r\nThe 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nhave not been developed in a vacuum. They have been \r\nreflected over the years in one form or another in our \r\nown development plans. It is therefore to the national \r\nlevel that we should direct implementation assistance, \r\nincluding with additional resources, capacity-building \r\nand technology transfers. That is where such assistance \r\ncan make a big difference in improving our peoples’ \r\nlives, especially at the grassroots level.\r\nIt will be a challenge if we have to continue \r\nto compete for resources within our multilateral \r\nagencies. On that note, I wish to acknowledge with \r\ndeep appreciation the continuing assistance for our \r\nsustainable development efforts from our development \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 19/46\r\npartners. But implementing the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development will require much more. The \r\nuniversal push to transform our world requires all of us \r\nto contribute. It requires a global effort.\r\nIt is troubling to note that for years, indeed decades, \r\nour global family has often ignored the support and \r\ninstrumental role of those who have contributed to \r\nthe implementation of our sustainable development \r\ngoals. As some of us would acknowledge, Taiwan \r\nhas served as a significant partner and contributed \r\nsignificantly to achieving the objectives of our global \r\nfamily. This must be acknowledged and the increased \r\nand meaningful participation of Taiwan in international \r\nprocesses should be encouraged. We need our global \r\ntransformation to include those who can contribute to \r\nthe effective implementation of the SDGs.\r\nI strongly believe that effective global transformation \r\nmust start with leadership at the individual, community, \r\nGovernment and national levels. Good governance, \r\ntransparency and accountability have been the \r\nfundamental guiding principles of my Government \r\nsince our assumption of office over six months ago. \r\nThey underpin our overarching policy objective to serve \r\nand to deliver to our people as responsible leaders.\r\nI am very proud to say that at our first meeting \r\nof Parliament, we established a select committee \r\non anti-corruption. Just last week, the Government \r\nsubmitted draft legislation to our Parliament on a code of \r\nconduct for leaders. In addition, during the same week, \r\nour Parliament passed a constitutional amendment that \r\nestablished a new Ministry of Justice. This will lead to \r\na strengthening of our justice system and elevate levels \r\nof transparency and accountability. We firmly believe \r\nthat, as a Government, we can transform our nation for \r\nthe better if our actions as leaders are underpinned by \r\nstrong principles of good governance, transparency and \r\naccountability. This promotes our people’s confidence \r\nand trust in their representatives.\r\nIf we are serious and genuine about the true \r\ntransformation that we are talking about, then I \r\nchallenge all of us, as leaders and representatives of our \r\npeoples, to ask ourselves this fundamental question: \r\nwhat is the greatest value and gift we have to give \r\nthat can break the barriers between our peoples, our \r\ncommunities, our nations and our global family and \r\ntruly transform our world? The answer is simple and the \r\ncommon denominator is also straightforward: it is our \r\nhearts and our love. This has been a missing ingredient \r\nin our recipe for global peace and security. Our biggest \r\nchallenge here at the United Nations is that we have not \r\nbeen sharing our hearts and our love with each other. In \r\nfact, over the past 70 years, what we have been doing is \r\nfighting within our own family. \r\nI truly believe that the heart of our United Nations \r\nfamily is the heart of all nations, big and small, \r\nland-locked and sea-locked, rich and poor, the most \r\nvulnerable and the least vulnerable. The heart of the \r\nUnited Nations should therefore beat for everyone, not \r\njust a few. Just this morning, I had the gracious honour \r\nand privilege to join the Federation of World Peace and \r\nLove in ringing a bell for love and peace in the world \r\nwith a special prayer for Kiribati. This is a reminder \r\nto the world, particularly to all of us leaders, of our \r\nfundamental role as peacemakers.\r\nWe are reminded every day of the very purpose of \r\nthis United Nations family — to promote and maintain \r\npeace and security in all its forms. It is a major challenge \r\nbut a challenge that I believe can be overcome if we \r\nstart working together as a true United Nations family \r\nwith love, care, compassion, understanding, respect \r\nand tolerance. This is a true global transformation that \r\ncan help our United Nations family serve its members \r\nand deliver solutions and results.\r\nWe are called upon to take up the challenge of this \r\nUnited Nations family gathering and ask whether or not \r\nwe can transform ourselves and make a difference in \r\nthe name of love — a simple but powerful and inclusive \r\nfour-letter word that resonates in the four corners of the \r\nworld. As we contemplate this question, I would like to \r\nconclude by sharing a poem that represents our hope \r\nand identity — an identity that we will fight to save \r\nas long as we can. We need help in this fight so that \r\na part of this global family does not get left behind or \r\nlose its liberty or identity. The title of the poem is “My \r\nFrigatebird”.\r\n“Cloaked in black, white-bellied, and fork-tailed,\r\n you are my beauty in the north.\r\nWith your long and graceful wings, you are my\r\n inspiration in the centre.\r\nAs you speed across the deep vast ocean, you are\r\n my sanctuary in the south.\r\nWith your clicking, wheezy calls, you are my song \r\n and my garland everywhere.\r\nOn a banner of blue, white, yellow and red, you\r\n ascend beyond the waves and the sun’s rays.\r\nNow you struggle against storms and westerly\r\n winds to find food and nesting.\r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n20/46 16-29553\r\nBut you will never leave in haste nor go in f light,\r\n for you are the fulcrum of the universe.\r\nArise, my frigate bird with valor and strength, rise \r\n over the perilous tides from the east and f ly \r\n brave and proud on the currents of wind, for \r\n you are and will always be my transformation.\r\nProud am I to be an I-Kiribati — my frigatebird,\r\n my liberty, my identity.”\r\nIn closing, I share with everyone in this Hall our \r\nhearts, our love and now our traditional blessing for \r\nhealth, peace and prosperity: “Te Mauri, Te Raoi ao Te \r\nTabomoa”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President, \r\nHead of Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Immigration of the Republic of Kiribati for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Patrice Athanase Guillaume Talon, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Benin\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Benin.\r\nMr. Patrice Athanase Guillaume Talon, President \r\nof the Republic of Benin, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Patrice Athanase Guillaume Talon, President of \r\nthe Republic of Benin, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nPresident Talon (spoke in French): I would like \r\nto start by congratulating Mr. Peter Thomson on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session. I would also like to recognize his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for the excellent \r\nwork he accomplished while President. I particularly \r\nwish to thank and congratulate Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his efforts and service to stability, peace, \r\nsecurity and development in the world.\r\nBenin warmly welcomes the theme of this year’s \r\nsession, entitled “The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals: a universal push to transform our world”, as it \r\nappropriately responds to current concerns. The world \r\nhas always managed to mobilize and organize itself \r\nwhen facing difficult challenges or global threats. \r\nThe challenge of climate change has led us to put our \r\nheads together and to take the decision to mobilize \r\nsubstantial resources.\r\nToday’s open world will suffer more than ever \r\nfrom the consequences of poverty — in particular, \r\nuncontrollable and destabilizing migration \r\nmovements — if nothing is done. Mass poverty has now \r\nbecome a major threat to humankind. It has become \r\nurgent to put in place a global programme to eradicate \r\nmass poverty, with the same determination that led \r\nus to hold the twenty-first session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. That being so, from \r\nthis rostrum I call on the most developed countries and \r\nthe institutions that finance development to implement \r\nstrong and collective action, with a view to eradicating \r\npoverty, which is dangerously sidelining the majority \r\nof African countries.\r\nMr. El Haycen (Mauritania), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe international community has the capacity to \r\ndo this, as it recently demonstrated when it prevented \r\nGreece and Ukraine from collapsing. That effort did \r\nnot ruin the countries or the institutions that mobilized \r\nthemselves in the rescue operation. To quickly and \r\nefficiently eradicate poverty and underdevelopment \r\nin Africa, that same will, but not necessarily more \r\nresources, will be required. Of course, African countries \r\nwill need to assume their share of responsibility by \r\ndoing more for political stability and, above all, for \r\ngood governance.\r\nMy country Benin is committed to this approach and \r\nhas initiated the necessary political, administrative and \r\ngood-governance reforms. One can add to this nearly \r\nhalf a century of political stability as well as a mature \r\ndemocracy — all of these elements give Benin the \r\nability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nprovided that the country receives adequate support.\r\nI would like to state that my country is committed \r\nto contributing actively to the implementation of the \r\ndecisions on climate change that were adopted during \r\nthe Paris Conference. I note that Benin has already \r\nsigned the Paris Agreement and the ratification process \r\nis ongoing. To conclude, I wish to reiterate that Benin \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 21/46\r\nremains committed within the international community \r\nto transforming the world with a view to achieving a \r\nshared well-being.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Benin for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Patrice Athanase Guillaume Talon, President \r\nof the Republic of Benin, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the \r\nRepublic of Côte d’Ivoire\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Côte d’Ivoire.\r\n Mr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Alassane \r\nOuattara, President of the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Ouattara (spoke in French): Our \r\nsession is taking place amid grim economic and social \r\ncircumstances that may slow down our collective \r\nprogress in combating poverty, reducing inequalities \r\nand implementing development programmes. Despite \r\nthese particular circumstances, we must be tireless in \r\nour pursuit to implement the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in the next 15 years.\r\nWe must win the fight against abject poverty and \r\nsuffering to spare humankind the potentially tragic \r\nconsequences of failed development. That is why I invite \r\ndeveloped countries to honour all their commitments to \r\ndeveloping countries in the context of the SDGs and \r\ndevelopment financing. Here, I remind the Assembly \r\nof the commitments made in July 2015 in Addis Ababa \r\nat the Third International Conference on Financing for \r\nDevelopment, and also those made regarding Goal 17 \r\nof the SDGs, as well as such specific instruments as the \r\nGreen Climate Fund.\r\nI welcome the choice of theme for the session, \r\nwhich reminds us of the need to accelerate the pace of \r\nchange in our societies and to give more opportunities \r\nand means to our most vulnerable populations. We \r\nmust therefore build productive economies if we wish \r\nto implement the SDG road map. Our true aspirations \r\nfor sustainable development must also be mindful of the \r\nenvironment and our determination to combat global \r\nwarming. We paved the way in Paris, and we must all \r\nimplement the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and \r\nhonour our commitments.\r\nMy country’s implementation of the Paris \r\nAgreement is under way. The Agreement has been \r\ndeemed to be in accordance with our Constitution, \r\nand my Government will deposit its instruments of \r\nratification before the end of the year. Through our \r\nNational Development Programme 2016-2020 and \r\nour Côte d’Ivoire Perspectives 2040, we intend to \r\nmobilize the means required to implement the SDGs. \r\nThe positive economic situation in our country has \r\nalready enabled us to improve all social indicators and \r\nembark on a comprehensive process to reduce poverty \r\nand redistribute the dividends of economic growth. All \r\nthese achievements will be fully enjoyed by our people \r\nin the long term.\r\nThe ongoing nature of many conflicts remains \r\na true concern for my country. Our Organization, \r\nin particular the Security Council and the main \r\nstakeholders concerned, must surpass themselves by \r\nengaging every means possible to end the suffering of \r\nthe peoples in Syria, the Middle East, South Sudan and \r\nMali, to mention but those conflicts. Even if the Council \r\nref lects our aspirations, the Council cannot effectively \r\nresolve the conflicts of our century with its current \r\nconfiguration and working methods. My country \r\ncalls on all Member States to act and to carry out a \r\ncomprehensive and just reform of the Security Council \r\nthat will further bolster its legitimacy in the eyes of the \r\nworld, and especially of the younger generations.\r\nThe world must mobilize against terrorism and \r\nfight it with the utmost resolve and determination \r\nbefore it inflicts irreparable damage and trauma on our \r\ncountries and societies. Here, I offer a thought for all \r\nthe victims of terrorism and express my sympathy to \r\nall the families who are in mourning around the world \r\non account of these barbaric acts. As many countries \r\nbefore it, my country witnessed unbearable scenes after \r\nthe cowardly attack in Grand Bassam, and that reminds \r\nus yet again, as if we needed reminding, that no country \r\ntoday is safe from a terrorist attack. No country alone \r\ncan eradicate this scourge. It falls on the United Nations \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n22/46 16-29553\r\ntherefore, to an even greater degree than in the past, to \r\ncoordinate international efforts to combat terrorism.\r\nUnless a collective effort is made to bear the \r\ncost of security for all, our developing countries will \r\ninvest in their national security the resources that \r\nwould otherwise be spent on tomorrow’s priority \r\nsocial programmes. We are familiar with the serious \r\nconsequences that this would entail, given our young \r\npopulations. The worsening security environment in \r\nmany countries has led to a sudden rise in migratory \r\nf lows of people who are ready to brave all the dangers \r\nof a Mediterranean crossing or a journey through \r\nthe Balkans to reach Europe in particular. Fear and \r\nisolation are not an appropriate response when these \r\nmigrants arrive.\r\nThe host countries and the international community \r\nas a whole must show solidarity and take initiatives in \r\norder to tackle the root causes of this phenomenon. \r\nCountries of origin must do more to improve living \r\nconditions and create a climate of peace and security for \r\ntheir citizens. My Government wishes to welcome the \r\nprogress achieved at the high-level plenary meeting on \r\naddressing large movements of refugees and migrants, \r\nheld here at United Nations Headquarters early this \r\nweek. But we must do more and do better.\r\nThe nation of Côte d’Ivoire is continuing to \r\ndevelop and modernize its institutions. The economy \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire continues to grow at an average \r\nannual rate of about 9 per cent. This has enabled us \r\nto pursue our efforts to establish the economic and \r\nsocial infrastructures that are needed to improve the \r\nwell-being of our population. Côte d’Ivoire is peaceful. \r\nThe successful presidential election in October 2015 \r\nput the seal on the return to peace and stability. In the \r\ncoming months, the Ivorian people will be called on to \r\nrenew the mandate of parliamentarians and to vote on \r\na new draft constitution, in line with our desire for a \r\nmodern State.\r\nGiven the satisfactory progress of recent years, in \r\nApril the Security Council lifted the sanctions regime \r\nthat had been imposed on Côte d’Ivoire in 2004. In June \r\n2017, the United Nations Operation in Côte d’Ivoire \r\n(UNOCI) will end its mandate and leave Côte d’Ivoire \r\nonce and for all after 12 years of continuous presence. We \r\nare particularly proud of these developments. UNOCI \r\ngoes down in the history of peacekeeping operations as \r\na real success story. I take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nour gratitude to the United Nations and all the countries \r\nthat provided troops to UNOCI.\r\nGiven this remarkable progression, my country \r\nhas decided to put forward its candidacy for a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2018-2019. The Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States and the African Union have endorsed our \r\nbid. In that regard, I call on all States Members of our \r\nOrganization to support the candidacy of Côte d’Ivoire \r\nduring the elections to be held in June 2017. Through \r\nthis candidacy, we intend to share with other Member \r\nStates our successful experience of peacekeeping and \r\ncooperation within the United Nations.\r\nI recall that Côte d’Ivoire has in the past contributed \r\nto the stabilization efforts in the Congo, Haiti and \r\nCentral Africa through the United Nations Organization \r\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, the United Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti \r\nand the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic, \r\nrespectively. It is in this spirit that Côte d’Ivoire, as \r\npart of the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in Mali, has worked side by \r\nside with our brothers in Mali in a transport company \r\nbetween 2013 and 2015, and we are prepared to send a \r\nprotection company of approximately 150 individuals \r\nby the end of the year.\r\nI cannot conclude my statement without paying \r\na well-deserved tribute and to express, on behalf \r\nof the people and the Government of Côte d’Ivoire \r\nand on my own behalf, our profound gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General, my friend Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his \r\nexceptional contribution to peace in the world and in \r\nour country. We commend him for his leadership, for \r\nthe wise way in which he has steered our Organization \r\nover the past years and for his constant commitment to \r\npeace, security and development in the world. As he \r\nends his term in the service of our Organization, we \r\nwish him well in his future endeavours.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Côte d’Ivoire for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Alassane Ouattara, President of the Republic \r\nof Côte d’Ivoire, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 23/46\r\nAddress by Mr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the \r\nState of Palestine\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe State of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State \r\nof Palestine, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud \r\nAbbas, President of the State of Palestine, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Abbas (spoke in Arabic): I had hoped \r\nthat I would not have to deliver this statement today, as \r\nwould have been the case if the cause of my people had \r\nbeen genuinely heard and justly resolved and if hearts \r\nand minds had acted to lift my people from oppression.\r\nAs everyone is aware, we accepted the primacy of \r\ninternational law and the resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy, and made a historic and immense sacrifice \r\nwhen the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), the \r\nsole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, \r\naccepted the establishment of the State of Palestine \r\nbased on the 4 June 1967 borders, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital.\r\nWhat more can be asked of us? We remain committed \r\nto the agreements reached with Israel in 1993. However, \r\nIsrael must reciprocate and act forthwith to resolve all \r\nthe final-status issues. It must cease all its settlement \r\nactivities and acts of aggression against our cities, \r\nvillages and refugee camps. It must cease its policies \r\nof collective punishment, its demolition of Palestinian \r\nhomes, its extrajudicial executions and the arrest of \r\nour people. It must release our prisoners and detainees, \r\nall thousands of them, and cease its aggression and \r\nprovocations against the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, for all \r\nthese policies and practices prevent the creation of an \r\nenvironment in which peace can prevail in our region.\r\nHow can anyone seeking peace commit such \r\nactions? In this regard, we reaffirm that we find the \r\ncurrent situation unacceptable. We will never accept \r\nthe humiliation of our people. We will never accept \r\ntemporary or interim solutions. Our people will never \r\nagree to forgo their national institutions and the other \r\nachievements that were won through great sacrifice, \r\nsuffering and pain. We will preserve the independence \r\nof Palestinian decision-making. We will act to fulfil \r\nthe aspirations of our people through political and \r\ndiplomatic means, while relying on international law \r\nand the legitimacy of international resolutions via the \r\nUnited Nations and all international forums. We will \r\nseek to mobilize Arab and international efforts to \r\nthat end. We will not accept the continuation of the \r\nstatus quo.\r\nThe 1993 Oslo Accords were intended to end the \r\noccupation, to achieve an independent State of Palestine \r\nwithin five years. Yet, Israel renounced the agreements \r\nit signed and persists in its occupation and continues \r\nto expand its illegal settlements, thereby undermining \r\nthe realization of the two-State solution on the basis of \r\nthe 1967 borders. Does Israel want one State? None of \r\nthe 12 Security Council resolutions condemning Israeli \r\nsettlements in the occupied Palestinian territory since \r\n1967 has been implemented, and Israel therefore pursues \r\nits plans for the seizure of more Palestinian land in the \r\nWest Bank, including East Jerusalem, with impunity. \r\nThe violent actions of Israeli settlers have gone as far \r\nas the formation of terrorist groups that burn homes and \r\nkill entire families, destroy properties and uproot the \r\ntrees that are the livelihood of Palestinian families.\r\nIsrael’s disrespect and contemptuous policies \r\nhave led to attempts to legalize the settlements and \r\nthe settlers’ colonization of our occupied land since \r\n1967 and even to the Israeli Prime Minister’s claim \r\nthat the call for the cessation of settlements and their \r\ndismantlement constitutes ethnic cleansing. All such \r\nclaims and attempts are null and void; they are clearly \r\nin grave breach of international law.\r\nSo, who then is practising ethnic cleansing? In that \r\nregard, I am compelled to warn the General Assembly \r\nagain that what the Israeli Government is doing in \r\npursuit of its expansionist settlement plans will destroy \r\nwhatever chance is left for the adoption of the two-State \r\nsolution based on the 1967 borders. The settlements \r\nare illegal in every respect and in any form. We will \r\ntherefore continue to exert all efforts for the adoption of \r\na Security Council resolution on the settlements and the \r\nterror perpetrated by the settlers. To that end, we are \r\ncurrently undertaking extensive consultations with the \r\nArab countries and other friendly countries. We hope \r\nthat no one will cast a veto against this draft resolution.\r\nThe racial discrimination against the Palestinian \r\npeople has become a daily reality as Israel continues to \r\nfavour the Israeli settlers on our occupied land, including \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n24/46 16-29553\r\nby granting them permits for residential construction, \r\nfactories, economic projects and infrastructure, such as \r\nroads, electricity and water networks. At the same time, \r\nIsrael is preventing the Palestinians — the owners of the \r\nland — from using their land and prohibiting them from \r\ndeveloping their economy in the West Bank, including \r\nJerusalem, the Jordan Valley and the Palestinian shores \r\non the Dead Sea. It continues with its illegal blockade \r\nof the Gaza Strip, as well as with its illegal alteration \r\nof the identity and status of occupied East Jerusalem \r\nand its acts of aggression and provocation against our \r\nChristian and Muslim holy sites, especially the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque. That is playing with fire. I repeat, it is playing \r\nwith fire. No one knows what may happen if those acts \r\nof aggression continue.\r\nAll of those Israeli policies, actions and measures \r\nare reasons for the failure of every international effort \r\nfor the past 13 years, particularly those of the Quartet, \r\nin the same way that Israel has sabotaged the efforts of \r\nsuccessive American Administrations over the decades. \r\nIn that regard, I have to once again appeal to the United \r\nNations to help provide international protection for the \r\nPalestinian people, who since 1967 have been suffering \r\nunder occupation in the West Bank, including East \r\nJerusalem, and in the Gaza Strip. I am very grateful in \r\nthat regard to the Secretary-General and the members of \r\nthe Security Council, who convened an Arria Formula \r\nmeeting of the Council to explore the possibilities of \r\ninternational protection for our people, and I urge that \r\nsuch efforts continue. If the United Nations cannot \r\nensure our protection, who will?\r\nToday Israel continues its attempts to evade the \r\npossibility of an international conference for peace, an \r\nidea proposed by France and supported by most of the \r\ncountries of the world. A ministerial meeting, in which \r\n28 countries and three intergovernmental organizations \r\nparticipated, was held in Paris in June to prepare for the \r\nconvening of such a conference. We continue to hope that \r\nholding such a conference can lead to the establishment \r\nof a mechanism and a defined time frame for ending the \r\noccupation, in accordance with the relevant resolutions \r\nof international legitimacy, the principle of land for \r\npeace and the Arab Peace Initiative — which, among \r\nother things, calls for a just and agreed-on solution for \r\nPalestinian refugees, in accordance with resolution \r\n194 (III). We hope that every country in the world will \r\nsupport convening such a peace conference before \r\nthe end of this year. Without an international peace \r\nconference and direct negotiations between us and the \r\nIsraelis, how can we make peace or even speak about it?\r\nInstead of ensuring that Israel acknowledges the \r\natrocities it continues to commit against our people, \r\nthe Israeli Prime Minister has had the audacity to \r\ncriticize Palestine’s statement at the Arab League \r\nSummit in Nouakchott, Mauritania, because it referred \r\nto the Balfour Declaration. I say to him today that \r\nour recognition in 1993 of the existence of the State \r\nof Israel, a recognition that continues to be valid, is \r\nnot free of charge. Israel should reciprocate with its \r\nown recognition of the State of Palestine and end its \r\noccupation of our land, so that the State of Palestine \r\nand the State of Israel can coexist alongside each other, \r\nin peace and security, as good neighbours, each within \r\nsecure and recognized borders.\r\nThere is no conflict between us and the Jewish \r\nreligion and people. Our conflict is with the Israeli \r\noccupation of our land. We have full respect for the \r\nJewish religion, which is a monotheistic one, just as we \r\nrespect other religions, and in that regard we condemn \r\nthe catastrophe of the Holocaust that befell the Jewish \r\npeople in Europe during the Second World War. It \r\nwas one of the most heinous crimes ever perpetrated \r\nagainst humankind. A historic reconciliation between \r\nthe Palestinian and Israeli peoples requires that Israel \r\nacknowledge its responsibility for the Nakba that is still \r\nbeing inflicted on our people to this very day. Such an \r\nacknowledgement would open a new era of coexistence \r\nand serve to build bridges rather than walls. I believe \r\nthat the Arab Peace Initiative embodies a reasonable, \r\nsensible solution. Yet Israel continues to insist on \r\nbeing selective, picking and choosing only parts of the \r\nInitiative, such as insisting on establishing relations \r\nwith the Arab countries before ending its occupation of \r\nPalestine. That is simply a recipe for more conflict in \r\nthe region. We will not accept it and neither will anyone \r\nelse. The Arab Peace Initiative should be implemented \r\nin full, from A to Z, and Israel must understand that.\r\nBy the end of the coming year, 100 years will have \r\npassed since the Balfour Declaration; 70 since the \r\nNakba of the Palestinian people; and 50 since Israel \r\noccupied the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, \r\nand the Gaza Strip. Yes, 100 years have passed since \r\nthe promulgation of the infamous Balfour Declaration, \r\nwhereby Britain gave the land of Palestine to another \r\npeople without any right, authority or consent from \r\nanyone. That paved the way for the Nakba and the \r\nPalestinian people’s dispossession and displacement \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 25/46\r\nfrom their land. As if that were not enough, the British \r\nmandate translated the Declaration into policies and \r\nmeasures that helped to perpetrate heinous crimes \r\nagainst a peaceful people in their own land, a people \r\nwho had never attacked or taken part in a war against \r\nanyone. As we approach the 100th anniversary of that \r\ninfamous Declaration, we would like to ask the British to \r\ndraw the necessary lessons and shoulder their historical, \r\nlegal, political, material and moral responsibilities for \r\nit, including an apology to the Palestinian people for the \r\ndisasters, misery and injustice that it has created, and \r\nto act to rectify that historic catastrophe and remedy \r\nits consequences, including through recognition of the \r\nState of Palestine. That is the least Britain can do.\r\nIn addition, since 1948, Israel has persisted in \r\nits contempt for international legitimacy by violating \r\nresolution 181 (II), known as the partition resolution, \r\nwhich called for the establishment of two States on \r\nthe historic land of Palestine according to a specific \r\npartition plan. Israeli forces seized more land than was \r\nallotted to Israel, constituting a grave breach of Articles \r\n39, 41 and 42 of the Charter of the United Nations. In \r\nparagraph (c) of that resolution, the General Assembly \r\nrequests that the Security Council\r\n“determine as a threat to the peace, breach of the \r\npeace or act of aggression, in accordance with \r\nArticle 39 of the Charter, any attempt to alter by \r\nforce the settlement envisaged by this resolution”.\r\nRegrettably, however, the Security Council is not \r\ndischarging its responsibility to hold Israel accountable \r\nfor seizing territory allotted to the Palestinian \r\nState under the partition resolution. Over half of the \r\nPalestinian territory was taken by Israel. To reiterate, \r\nthe Security Council is not discharging its responsibility \r\nto hold Israel accountable for its seizure of territory \r\nallotted to the Palestinian State under the partition \r\nresolution. I appeal to everyone to read resolution 181 \r\n(II) once again.\r\nWe continue our efforts to promote a culture of \r\npeace among our people. We stand firmly against \r\nterrorism in all its forms and manifestations. We \r\ncondemn terrorism regardless of who perpetrates it \r\nor where it is perpetrated. Our region has been the \r\nprincipal victim of terrorism, a scourge that it has \r\nendured for many years. We support the unity of \r\npeople and respect for territorial integrity. We are in \r\nfavour of reaching political solutions for the conflicts \r\nin Syria, Libya, Iraq and elsewhere. We commend the \r\nefforts of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to strengthen \r\nthe foundations of legitimacy in Yemen. We support the \r\nefforts to confront and overcome terrorism, extremism, \r\nsectarianism and violence. I appeal to everyone to stand \r\nunited against terrorism. Terrorism knows no religion.\r\nIn that connection, I wish to reaffirm that there is \r\nno way to defeat terrorism and extremism and achieve \r\nsecurity and stability in our region unless we end the \r\nIsraeli occupation of Palestine and ensure the freedom \r\nand independence of the Palestinian people. Fighting \r\nterrorism and extremism begins with the ending of the \r\nIsraeli occupation of Palestine.\r\nWe continue our genuine, dedicated efforts to \r\nachieve Palestinian reconciliation with the formation \r\nof a national unity Government in accordance with \r\nthe political platform of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization and the holding of presidential and \r\nparliamentary elections. We are committed to \r\nrebuilding Gaza, alleviating the hardships of our people \r\nand lifting the illegal blockade imposed on them.\r\nOur hand remains outstretched to those interested \r\nin peacebuilding. There is one outstanding question that \r\nwe have to keep asking over and over again, namely, is \r\nthere any leader in Israel, the occupying Power, who \r\ntruly desires to make peace and abandon the mentality \r\nof hegemony, expansionism and colonization? Is there \r\nany Israeli leader who will recognize the rights of our \r\npeople and end the historical injustice inflicted upon \r\nthem? It is Israel’s breach of the agreements it has \r\nsigned and its failure to comply with the obligations \r\nit has assumed that have caused the deadlock and \r\nstalemate in which we find ourselves.\r\nThe State of Palestine, which was accorded the \r\nstatus of observer State in the United Nations with the \r\nsupport of 138 countries, is a State under occupation. \r\nThe Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization — the only legitimate representative of \r\nthe Palestinian people wherever they may be — acts \r\non behalf of our people and as their Government. The \r\nPalestine National Council is the Parliament of the \r\nState of Palestine, as reflected in resolution 67/19.\r\n We have not lost hope yet. We expect the \r\ninternational community to shoulder its responsibilities. \r\nWe call on countries that have acted against our people \r\nto rectify such injustices. Moreover, we appeal to \r\ncountries that have not yet recognized the State of \r\nPalestine to do so. Those who believe in the two-State \r\nsolution — and everyone speaks about the two-State \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n26/46 16-29553\r\nsolution — should recognize both States and not just \r\none of them.\r\nI invite the General Assembly to mark this seventy-\r\nfirst session by declaring 2017 as the international year \r\nto end the Israeli occupation of our land. In June 2017 \r\nhalf a century will have elapsed since the abhorrent \r\nIsraeli occupation began. I also appeal to members, as a \r\nfollow-up to resolution 67/19, to adopt a draft resolution \r\nthat will enable Palestine to submit and co-sponsor \r\ndraft resolutions on subjects other than the question \r\nof Palestine and to support our efforts to enhance \r\nPalestine’s legal and political status by granting it \r\nadditional responsibilities to chair committees and \r\ngroups as we continue our quest for full membership in \r\ninternational organizations.\r\nGiven all this, the international community is called \r\nupon, now more than ever, to exert all efforts to bring \r\nan end to the Israeli occupation of the land of the State \r\nof Palestine. As members are aware, this is the longest \r\nand the last occupation in contemporary history. If the \r\ninternational community were to deliver on its ability \r\nto advance the rights of our people, ensure the exercise \r\nof those same rights and end the oppression and \r\ninjustice imposed on our people for seven decades, that \r\nwould surely present a unique opportunity for peace, \r\nstability and coexistence in our region and between \r\nthe Palestinian and Israeli people. It would create a \r\nbetter future for the current generation and succeeding \r\ngenerations. It would be a beginning, a basis for ending \r\nextremism and violence in our region and the world. \r\nI hope, from the depths of my heart, that the Israeli \r\noccupation of our land will end, that we can defeat \r\nterrorism, that the current conflicts will be concluded \r\nand that peace will prevail in our region and around \r\nthe world. Our people will continue to open the door \r\nto peace and do all we can to grant our people freedom \r\nand independence. We will remain steadfast in our \r\nland, and we will work to prepare the future of the next \r\ngeneration. It is my hope that I will not have to deliver \r\nthis same statement again next year. It is our collective \r\nresponsibility to ensure that 2017 is the year when the \r\noccupation ends. Will the Assembly discharge that \r\nresponsibility? I truly hope so.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the State of Palestine for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Mahmoud Abbas, President of the State of \r\nPalestine, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Ms. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister \r\nof Norway\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Norway.\r\nMs. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Erna \r\nSolberg, Prime Minister of Norway, and inviting her to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMs. Solberg (Norway): This year’s session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly comes at a critical time. Over the \r\npast few years we have witnessed grave violations of \r\nthe very principles on which the United Nations is \r\nbased — violations that have caused widespread human \r\nsuffering and insecurity. Syria, Yemen, Ukraine and \r\nSouth Sudan are some examples, but the list goes on. \r\nYet at the same time, the world has moved forward, \r\ncountries have come together, found compromises and \r\ntaken joint action, as, for example, when we reached \r\nthe Paris Agreement and adopted the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development — the road map for our \r\nfuture coexistence and cooperation.\r\nTherefore, where do we go from here? We cannot \r\nlet fear guide our actions. We cannot return to a \r\nworld of zero-sum games, narrow national interests \r\nand protectionism. We cannot move away from a \r\nrules-based system that guards against confrontation \r\nand unpredictability. We — the international \r\ncommunity — must rally around the multilateral system \r\nwith renewed strength. Let me assure the Assembly \r\nthat Norway will work hard to promote respect for \r\ninternational law and to find common solutions.\r\nMy own continent, Europe, has enjoyed a unique \r\nera of peace, democracy and trade. Now, however, we \r\nare facing a complex security situation. Unfortunately, \r\nsome States have chosen not to abide by international \r\nlaw and are simply pursuing national interests at the \r\nexpense of others. Instability in the Middle East and \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 27/46\r\nNorth Africa is causing widespread human suffering \r\nand leading to violent extremism in Europe. The \r\nresponse should not be to isolate ourselves; instead, we \r\nmust cooperate and find solutions. \r\nThe humanitarian situation in Syria simply cannot \r\nbe tolerated. Global and regional Powers must take \r\naction to secure an enduring ceasefire and ensure \r\nhumanitarian access — right now. The world expects \r\nthe Security Council and the International Syria \r\nSupport Group to deliver. And it is not just Syria that \r\nwe need to focus on. Conflict and suffering continue \r\nelsewhere, and more needs to be done to find common \r\nsolutions to common challenges. In that context, let me \r\nsend a message to President Abbas and Prime Minister \r\nNetanyahu, who are speaking before and after me today. \r\nI strongly urge the parties to address the imminent \r\nthreats to the two-State solution by implementing the \r\nrecommendations in the Quartet report.\r\nWe must intensify our efforts to tackle the \r\nhumanitarian consequences of today’s crises. Norway \r\nwill continue to provide record levels of humanitarian \r\nassistance — to Syria, to South Sudan and elsewhere. \r\nTogether we need to intensify our efforts to promote \r\npeace and stability in a wide range of fragile and \r\nconflict-affected States. We need to strengthen the \r\ncapacity of the United Nations to help countries \r\nemerging from conflict. We have a clear responsibility \r\nto fight terrorism and step up our efforts to prevent \r\nviolent extremism. In order to do so, we need to work \r\nclosely with civil society, women, young people, faith \r\nleaders and local communities.\r\nWe need to translate the women and peace and \r\nsecurity agenda into more effective action on the ground. \r\nWe need to ensure that peace operations deliver on \r\ntheir mandates to protect civilians. Sexual exploitation \r\nand abuse must stop. We need zero tolerance and \r\nresolute action by the United Nations. United Nations \r\npeacekeepers, development workers and humanitarian \r\nworkers from a large number of countries are making \r\na real difference in numerous countries, including \r\nMali and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. They \r\nmust be equipped with the tools and resources they \r\nneed. I would like to assure the Assembly that Norway \r\nwill continue to provide substantial humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment assistance and support the reform of \r\nUnited Nations peace operations. \r\nHowever, we cannot prevent or resolve conflicts \r\nby addressing the consequences alone. We must also \r\naddress the underlying causes. Thankfully, in some \r\nplaces, our efforts are producing tangible results. After \r\nmore than five decades of conflict, peace is now within \r\nreach in Colombia. I am proud that, together with Cuba, \r\nNorway facilitated the peace process. It will be a great \r\nand historic step forward for the region, and Norway \r\nwill continue to provide diplomatic and practical \r\nsupport to the Colombian peace process in its crucial \r\nimplementation phase.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are \r\nground-breaking. They provide us with a road map for \r\nthe future we want, and we have agreed to leave no one \r\nbehind. That means that we must address inequality \r\nand social injustice and safeguard the rule of law. It \r\nalso means that we must empower women and men \r\nalike. We must strengthen the human rights pillar of \r\nthe United Nations, both financially and politically. \r\nThat should be seen as an important investment in \r\nthe future. I would like to highlight the role played by \r\nthose who promote the rights of others — of women, \r\nminorities and members of marginalized communities. \r\nHuman rights defenders are an important corrective in \r\nany society, and only weak leaders fear correction.\r\nThe SDGs are all about building inclusive societies. \r\nInclusive societies perform better. The right to education \r\nand health is crucial in that regard. Today there are \r\n263 million children and young people who are not in \r\nschool, and the number is growing. Last year, together \r\nwith the Presidents of Chile, Indonesia and Malawi \r\nand the Director-General of UNESCO, I initiated the \r\nestablishment of the International Commission on \r\nFinancing Global Education Opportunity. On Sunday, \r\nthe Commission submitted a report entitled “The \r\nLearning Generation” with recommendations to the \r\nSecretary-General. The Commission makes a strong \r\ncase for why it is so vital to ensure that the world invests \r\nin education as a key driver of economic growth. I \r\ncould not agree more. We must avoid a global learning \r\ncrisis, and the consequences of inaction will be severe. \r\nTogether, we must invest more to ensure that no one is \r\nleft behind. Each and every one of us should have the \r\nsame learning opportunities, and the education of girls \r\nis especially important. When girls go to school and \r\nget an education, it not only represents the exercise of \r\na fundamental right, it is also good for the economy. \r\nGlobal education will continue to be a top priority of \r\nNorway’s development policy.\r\nMr. Zamora Rivas (El Salvador), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n28/46 16-29553\r\nAnother priority for Norway is strengthening \r\nepidemic preparedness and global health security by \r\ndeveloping new vaccines that can prevent new outbreaks. \r\nThat important goal requires effective partnerships \r\nacross national borders and across every sector of \r\nsociety, along with the mobilization of both domestic \r\nand private-sector resources. Antibiotic medicines have \r\nsaved millions of lives, but antimicrobial resistance is \r\nmaking them increasingly ineffective. If we do not act, \r\nwe could reach a stage where common infections are \r\nonce again deadly. Our grandchildren could die from \r\nillnesses that our grandparents survived. New global \r\nhealth challenges require increased international \r\ncooperation. I am therefore pleased that we managed \r\nto put the issue high on the agenda this week. We know \r\nwhat needs to be done, and now it is time do the work \r\nback home.\r\nThe Climate Conference in Paris late last year \r\nmarked a turning point in the fight to save our planet. \r\nWe now need effective and concerted action in order \r\nto bring down emissions and meet the ambitious \r\nobjectives that we have set ourselves. Our ambition is \r\nto do all of that while still providing decent work and \r\neconomic growth for all. That will require investment \r\nin innovation, and we have no time to lose.\r\nIn the decades ahead, the oceans will play a \r\nbigger role in the global economy. Today, 17 per cent \r\nof all of the animal protein consumed globally comes \r\nfrom the sea. In order to meet growing demands, the \r\nshare of our food that we obtain from the oceans will \r\nhave to increase substantially. Since growth from \r\ncapture fisheries is limited, we need more sustainable \r\naquaculture. As world trade continues to grow, the need \r\nfor marine transport will increase. The oceans are also \r\nalready a major source of energy. That resource must be \r\ndeveloped further, so as to meet the growing demand \r\nfor clean and renewable energy. In short, the oceans \r\nhold great promise for the future. We have seen only \r\nthe very beginning of the blue economy. The United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea strikes \r\na delicate balance between competing interests and \r\nneeds, enabling us to realize the potential of marine \r\nresources, protect marine biodiversity and prevent \r\nconflicts in the maritime domain.\r\nThe adoption of the SDGs and the Paris Agreement \r\nshows what can be achieved when countries come \r\ntogether to find compromises and take action. In \r\nour globalized and interdependent world, effective \r\ninternational cooperation is essential if we are to \r\naddress poverty, conflicts, climate change, migration \r\nand terrorism. No Government can single-handedly \r\ndeliver effective solutions to the challenges we face. \r\nThis morning, Norway, together with Colombia, \r\nEthiopia, Ghana, Indonesia, Jordan and Mexico, \r\npresented five recommendations intended for the new \r\nSecretary-General, aimed at promoting an independent \r\nand credible United Nations that can play a uniting and \r\nleading role. The United Nations has a unique place in the \r\nmultilateral world order. It is our shared responsibility \r\nto defend a world order in which solutions are found \r\nthrough negotiation and respect for international law. \r\nThe validity of the United Nations mandate remains \r\nstrong, but the Organization will also have to reform \r\nitself if it is to address the challenges ahead.\r\nI would like to thank Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his hard work and success in a range of \r\nareas, including the adoption of the SDGs. The next \r\nSecretary-General must continue to defend and promote \r\nthe multilateral world order and lead the process of \r\nchange that will be needed in order to ensure global \r\nstability and sustainable development for all. Norway \r\nwill support him or her in that endeavour.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Norway for the statement she has \r\njust made.\r\nMs. Erna Solberg, Prime Minister of Norway, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Israel\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Israel.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the State \r\nof Israel, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Netanyahu (Israel): What I am about to say is \r\ngoing to shock everyone — Israel has a bright future \r\nat the United Nations. I know that hearing that from \r\nme must surely come as a surprise, because year after \r\nyear I have stood at this very rostrum and slammed \r\nthe United Nations for its obsessive bias against Israel. \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 29/46\r\nAnd the United Nations has deserved every scathing \r\nword — for instance, for the disgrace of the General \r\nAssembly last year, which adopted 20 resolutions \r\nagainst the democratic State of Israel and a grand total \r\nof three resolutions against all the other countries on \r\nthe planet. Israel, 20; the rest of the world, three.\r\nAnd what about the joke called the United Nations \r\nHuman Rights Council, which each year condemns \r\nIsrael more than all the countries of the world combined? \r\nAs women are being systematically raped, murdered \r\nand sold into slavery across the world, which is the \r\nonly country that the United Nations Commission on \r\nthe Status of Women chose to condemn this year? Yes, \r\nIsrael. Israel, where women fly fighter jets, lead major \r\ncorporations, head universities, preside — twice — over \r\nthe Supreme Court, and have served as Speaker of the \r\nKnesset and Prime Minister. And that circus continues \r\nat UNESCO, the United Nations body charged with \r\npreserving world heritage. This is hard to believe, \r\nbut UNESCO just denied the 4,000-year connection \r\nbetween the Jewish people and its holiest site, the \r\nTemple Mount. That is just as absurd as denying the \r\nconnection between the Great Wall of China and China.\r\nThe United Nations, which began as a moral force, \r\nhas become a moral farce. Therefore, when it comes to \r\nIsrael at the United Nations, one might well think that \r\nnothing will ever change. Well, think again. Everything \r\nwill change, and a lot sooner than one might think. The \r\nchange will happen in this Hall, because back home \r\nGovernments are rapidly changing their attitudes \r\ntowards Israel. Sooner or later, that is going to change \r\nthe way everyone votes on Israel at the United Nations.\r\nMore and more nations in Asia, in Africa and in \r\nLatin America see Israel as a potent partner in fighting \r\nthe terrorism of today and in developing the technology \r\nof tomorrow. Today, Israel has diplomatic relations \r\nwith over 160 countries, nearly double the number \r\nfrom when I served here as Israel’s Ambassador \r\nsome 30 years ago. Those ties are getting broader \r\nand deeper every day. World leaders increasingly \r\nappreciate that Israel is a powerful country with one \r\nof the best intelligence services on Earth. Because of \r\nour unmatched experience and proven capabilities in \r\nfighting terrorism, many Governments will seek our \r\nhelp in keeping their countries safe.\r\nMany also seek to benefit from Israel’s ingenuity \r\nin agriculture, in health, in water, in cybersecurity and \r\nin the fusion of big data, connectivity and artificial \r\nintelligence — that fusion that is changing our world \r\nin every way. Israel leads the world in recycling \r\nwastewater. We recycle about 90 per cent of our \r\nwastewater. How remarkable is that? Given that the \r\nnext country on the list recycles only about 20 per cent \r\nof its wastewater, Israel is a global water Power. If we \r\nhave a thirsty world, and we do, there is no better ally \r\nthan Israel.\r\nHow about cybersecurity? That is an issue that \r\naffects everyone. Israel accounts for one tenth of 1 per \r\ncent of the world’s population, yet last year we attracted \r\nsome 20 per cent of the global private investment in \r\ncybersecurity. If we digest that number, we see that \r\nIsrael is punching a whopping 200 times above its \r\nweight. Therefore, Israel is also a global cybersecurity \r\nPower. If hackers are targeting banks, planes, power \r\ngrids and just about everything else, Israel can offer \r\nindispensable help. Governments are changing their \r\nattitudes towards Israel because they know that Israel \r\ncan help them protect, feed and improve the lives of \r\ntheir people.\r\nThis summer, I had an unbelievable opportunity to \r\nsee that change vividly during an unforgettable visit to \r\nfour African countries. That was the first visit to Africa \r\nby an Israeli Prime Minister in decades. Later today, I \r\nwill be meeting with leaders from 17 African countries. \r\nWe will discuss how Israeli technology can help them \r\nin their efforts to transform their countries. In Africa, \r\nthings are changing. In China, India, Russia and Japan, \r\nattitudes towards Israel have changed as well. Those \r\npowerful nations know that, despite Israel’s small size, \r\nit can make a big difference in many areas that are \r\nimportant to them.\r\nBut now I am going to surprise everyone even more. \r\nThe biggest changes in attitudes towards Israel is taking \r\nplace elsewhere. It is taking place in the Arab world. \r\nOur peace treaties with Egypt and Jordan continue to \r\nbe anchors of stability in the volatile Middle East. For \r\nthe first time in my lifetime, many other States in the \r\nregion recognize that Israel is not their enemy. They \r\nrecognize that Israel is their ally. Our common enemies \r\nare Iran and the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham. Our \r\ncommon goals are security, prosperity and peace.\r\nI believe that, in the years ahead, we will work \r\ntogether to achieve those goals, work together openly. \r\nTherefore, Israel’s diplomatic relations are undergoing \r\nnothing less than a revolution. But in that revolution \r\nwe never forget that our cherished alliance, our deepest \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n30/46 16-29553\r\nfriendship, is with the United States of America, the \r\npowerful and the most generous nation on Earth. Our \r\nunbreakable bond with the United States of America \r\ntranscends parties and politics. It ref lects, above all \r\nelse, the overwhelming support for Israel among the \r\nAmerican people, support which is at record highs and \r\nfor which we are deeply grateful.\r\nThe United Nations denounces Israel; the United \r\nStates supports Israel. And a central pillar of that \r\ndefence has been America’s consistent support for Israel \r\nat the United Nations. I appreciate President Obama’s \r\ncommitment to that long-standing United States policy. \r\nIn fact, the only time that the United States cast a \r\nSecurity Council veto during the Obama presidency \r\nwas against an anti-Israel draft resolution in 2011 (see \r\nS/PV.6484). As President Obama rightly declared at \r\nthis rostrum, peace will not come from statements and \r\nresolutions at the United Nations. I believe the day is \r\nnot far off when Israel will be able to rely on many \r\ncountries to stand with us at the United Nations. Slowly \r\nbut surely, the days when United Nations Ambassadors \r\nreflexively condemn Israel are coming to an end.\r\nToday’s automatic majority against Israel at the \r\nUnited Nations reminds me of the incredible story \r\nof Hiroo Onada, who was a Japanese soldier sent to \r\nthe Philippines in 1944. He lived in the jungle. He \r\nscavenged for food. He evaded capture. Eventually he \r\nsurrendered, but that did not happen until 1974, some \r\n30 years after the end of the Second World War. For \r\ndecades, Hiroo refused to believe the war was over. \r\nAs Hiroo was hiding in the jungle, Japanese tourists \r\nwere swimming in pools in American luxury hotels \r\nin nearby Manila. Finally, mercifully, Hiroo’s former \r\ncommanding officer was sent to persuade him to come \r\nout of hiding. Only then did Hiroo lay down his arms.\r\nI have one message for those present here today, \r\nthat is, that they too should lay down their arms. The \r\nwar against Israel at the United Nations is over. Perhaps \r\nsome of those present do not know it yet, but I am \r\nconfident that one day in the not too distant future they \r\nwill also get the message from their leaders informing \r\nthem that the war against Israel at the United Nations \r\nhas ended. Yes, I know, there might be a storm before \r\nthe calm. I know there is talk about ganging up on Israel \r\nat the United Nations later this year.\r\nGiven the United Nations history of hostility \r\ntowards Israel, does anyone really believe that Israel will \r\nlet the United Nations determine our security and our \r\nvital national interests? We will not accept any attempt \r\nby the United Nations to dictate terms to Israel. The \r\nroad to peace runs through Jerusalem and Ramallah, \r\nnot through New York. But regardless of what happens \r\nin the months ahead, I have total confidence that, in the \r\nyears ahead, the revolution in Israel’s standing among \r\nthe nations will finally penetrate this Hall of nations. \r\nI have so much confidence, in fact, that I predict that \r\na decade from now an Israeli Prime Minister will stand \r\nright here where I am standing and actually applaud \r\nthe United Nations. But I want to ask: why do we have \r\nto wait a decade? Why keep vilifying Israel? Perhaps \r\nbecause some do not appreciate that the obsessive bias \r\nagainst Israel is not just a problem for my country, it \r\nis a problem for the other countries too. If the United \r\nNations spends so much time condemning the only \r\nliberal democracy in the Middle East, it has far less \r\ntime to address war, disease, poverty, climate change \r\nand all of the other serious problems that plague the \r\nplanet.\r\nAre the half-million slaughtered Syrians helped \r\nby Member States’ condemnation of Israel? The same \r\nIsrael that has treated thousands of injured Syrians \r\nin our hospitals, including a field hospital that I built \r\nright along the Golan Heights border with Syria. Are \r\nthe gays hanging from cranes in Iran helped by acts to \r\ndenigrate Israel? That same Israel where gays march \r\nproudly in our streets and serve in our Parliament, \r\nincluding, I am proud to say, in my own Likud party. \r\nThe starving children in North Korea’s brutal tyranny, \r\nare they helped by the demonization of Israel? Israel, \r\nwhose agricultural know-how is feeding the hungry \r\nthroughout the developing world? The sooner the United \r\nNations obsession with Israel ends, the better — the \r\nbetter for Israel, the better for other countries, the \r\nbetter for the United Nations itself.\r\nIf United Nations habits die hard, Palestinian habits \r\ndie even harder. President Abbas just attacked, from \r\nthis rostrum, the Balfour Declaration. He is preparing \r\na lawsuit against Britain for that declaration from 1917. \r\nThat is almost 100 years ago — talk about being stuck \r\nin the past. The Palestinians may just as well sue Iran \r\nfor the Cyrus Declaration, which enabled the Jews to \r\nrebuild our Temple in Jerusalem 2,500 years ago. Come \r\nto think of it, why not a Palestinian class action suit \r\nagainst Abraham for buying that plot of land in Hebron \r\nwhere the fathers and mothers of the Jewish people were \r\nburied 4,000 years ago? It is as absurd as that. To sue \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 31/46\r\nthe British Government for the Balfour Declaration? Is \r\nhe kidding? And that is taken seriously here? \r\nPresident Abbas attacked the Balfour Declaration \r\nbecause it recognized the right of the Jewish people to \r\na national home in the land of Israel. When the United \r\nNations supported the establishment of a Jewish State in \r\n1947, it recognized our historical and our moral rights \r\nto our homeland. Yet today, nearly 70 years later, the \r\nPalestinians still refuse to recognize those rights — not \r\nour right to a homeland, not our right to a State, not our \r\nright to anything. And that remains the true core of the \r\nconflict: the persistent Palestinian refusal to recognize \r\nthe Jewish State in any boundary. One can see that the \r\nconflict is not about the settlements. It never was.\r\nThe conflict raged for decades before there was a \r\nsingle settlement, when Judea, Samaria and Gaza were \r\nall in Arab hands. The West Bank and Gaza were in \r\nArab hands, and they attacked us again and again and \r\nagain. And when we uprooted all 21 settlements in \r\nGaza and withdrew from every last inch of Gaza, we \r\ndid not get peace from Gaza — we got thousands of \r\nrockets fired at us from Gaza.\r\nThe conflict rages because for the Palestinians the \r\nreal settlements they are after are Haifa, Jaffa and Tel \r\nAviv. Keep in mind, the issue of settlements is a real \r\none, and it can and must be resolved in final-status \r\nnegotiations. But this conflict has never been about the \r\nsettlements, nor about establishing a Palestinian State. \r\nIt has always been about the existence of a Jewish State, \r\na Jewish State within any boundaries. Israel is ready, as \r\nam I, to negotiate all final-status issues. However, one \r\nthing I will never negotiate is our right to our State, the \r\none and only Jewish State. Change may be coming sooner \r\nthan I thought. \r\nHad the Palestinians said yes to a Jewish State in 1947, \r\nthere would have been no war, no refugees and no conflict. \r\nWhen the Palestinians finally say yes to a Jewish State, we \r\nwill be able to end our conflict once and for all. \r\nThe real tragedy is that the Palestinians are not only \r\ntrapped in the past, but their leaders are poisoning the future. \r\nBy way of illustration, I want the Assembly to imagine a \r\nday in the life of a 13-year-old Palestinian boy named Ali. \r\nAli wakes up before school and goes to soccer practice with \r\na team named after Dalal Mughrabi, a Palestinian terrorist \r\nresponsible for the murder of a busload of 37 Israelis. At \r\nschool, Ali attends an event sponsored by the Palestinian \r\nMinistry of Education honouring Baha Alyan, who last year \r\nmurdered three Israeli civilians.\r\nOn his walk home, Ali looks up at a towering statue \r\nerected just a few weeks ago by the Palestinian authorities \r\nto honour Abu Sukar, who detonated a bomb in the centre \r\nof Jerusalem, killing 15 Israelis. When Ali gets home, he \r\nturns on the television and sees an interview with a senior \r\nPalestinian official, Jibril Rajoub, who says that, if he had \r\na nuclear bomb, he would have detonated it over Israel that \r\nvery morning. \r\nAli then turns on the radio, and he hears President Abbas’ \r\nadviser Sultan Abu al-Einein urging Palestinians to “slit the \r\nthroats of Israelis wherever you find them”. Ali checks his \r\nFacebook, and he sees a recent post by President Abbas’ \r\nFatah party, calling the massacre of 11 Israeli athletes at \r\nthe Munich Olympics in 1972 a “heroic act”. On YouTube, \r\nAli watches a clip of President Abbas himself saying “we \r\nwelcome every drop of blood spilled in Jerusalem”. \r\nOver dinner, Ali asks his mother what would happen \r\nif he killed a Jew and went to an Israeli prison. She tells \r\nhim that he would be paid thousands of dollars each month \r\nby the Palestinian authorities. In fact, she tells him that the \r\nmore Jews he killed, the more money he would get. When \r\nhe gets out of prison, Ali would be guaranteed a job with the \r\nPalestinian authorities.\r\nAll of that is not just a story, it is real. It happens every \r\nday, all the time. Sadly, Ali represents hundreds of thousands \r\nof Palestinian children who are indoctrinated with hate during \r\nevery moment of every hour. That is child abuse. Imagine if \r\nit were our children undergoing such brainwashing. Imagine \r\nwhat it takes for a young boy or girl to break free of such a \r\nculture of hate. Some do, but far too many do not. \r\nHow can any of us expect young Palestinians to support \r\npeace when their leaders poison their minds against peace? \r\nIn Israel we do not do that; we educate our children for peace. \r\nIn fact, my Government recently launched a pilot programme \r\nto make the study of Arabic mandatory for Jewish children, \r\nso that we can better understand each other, and so that we \r\ncan live together side by side, in peace. Of course, like all \r\nsocieties, Israel has fringe elements. But it is our response to \r\nthose fringe elements that makes all the difference. \r\nLet us consider the tragic case of Ahmed Dawabsha. I \r\nshall never forget visiting Ahmed in the hospital, just hours \r\nafter he was attacked. This little boy — a baby — was badly \r\nburned. Ahmed was the victim of a horrible terrorist attack \r\nperpetrated by Jews. He lay bandaged and unconscious as \r\nIsraeli doctors worked around the clock to save him. No \r\nwords could bring comfort to this boy or to his family. \r\nNevertheless, as I stood by his bedside, I told his uncle: \r\n“This is not our people. This is not our way”. I then ordered \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n32/46 16-29553\r\nextraordinary measures to bring Ahmed’s assailants to \r\njustice, and today the Jewish citizens of Israel accused of \r\nattacking the Dawabsha family are in jail awaiting trial. \r\nFor some, that story shows that both sides have their \r\nextremists and that both sides are equally responsible for our \r\nseemingly endless conflict. However, what Ahmed’s story \r\nactually proves is the very opposite. It illustrates the profound \r\ndifference between our two societies. While Israeli leaders \r\ncondemn terrorists — Arabs and Jews alike — Palestinian \r\nleaders celebrate terrorists. While Israel jails the handful of \r\nJewish terrorists among us, the Palestinians pay thousands \r\nof terrorists among them. \r\nI therefore call upon President Abbas to tell him that \r\nhe has a choice to make. He can continue to stoke hatred, \r\nas he did today, or he can finally confront hatred and work \r\nwith me to establish peace between our two peoples. I know \r\nthat many of you have given up on peace, but I want it to be \r\nknown that I have not given up on peace. \r\nI remain committed to a vision of peace based on two \r\nStates, for two peoples. I believe, more than ever before, that \r\nchanges taking place in the Arab world today offer a unique \r\nopportunity to advance that peace. In that connection, \r\nI commend President Al Sisi of Egypt for his efforts to \r\nadvance peace and stability in our region. \r\nIsrael welcomes the spirit of the Arab Peace Initiative \r\nand welcomes a dialogue with Arab States to advance a \r\nbroader peace. I believe that, in order for that broader peace \r\nto be fully achieved, the Palestinians have to be part of it. I \r\nam ready to begin negotiations to achieve that today without \r\nany further delay. \r\nAlthough President Abbas spoke here an hour ago, \r\nwould it not be better if, instead of speaking past each other, \r\nwe were speaking to one another? I invite President Abbas \r\nto speak to the Israeli people at the Knesset in Jerusalem, \r\ninstead of railing against Israel at the United Nations in \r\nNew York. I would gladly come to speak to the Palestinian \r\nParliament in Ramallah. \r\nWhile Israel seeks peace with all our neighbours, \r\nwe also know that peace has no greater enemy than \r\nthe forces of militant Islam. The bloody trail of such \r\nfanaticism runs through all the continents represented \r\nhere. It runs through Paris and Nice, Brussels and \r\nBaghdad, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, Minnesota and New \r\nYork. From Sydney to San Bernadino, so many have \r\nsuffered its savagery: Christians and Jews, women and \r\ngays, Yazidis and Kurds and many others. \r\nYet the heaviest price of all has been paid \r\nby innocent Muslims — hundreds of thousands \r\nmercilessly slaughtered, millions turned into desperate \r\nrefugees, tens of millions brutally subjugated. The \r\ndefeat of militant Islam will therefore be a victory for \r\nall humankind. It will especially be a victory for the \r\nmany Muslims who seek a life without fear — a life of \r\npeace, a life of hope. \r\nTo defeat the forces of militant Islam, we must \r\nfight them relentlessly. We must fight them in the real \r\nworld. We must fight them in the virtual world. We \r\nmust dismantle their networks, disrupt their funding \r\nchannels and discredit their ideology. We can defeat \r\nthem, and we will defeat them. Medievalism is no match \r\nfor modernity. Hope is stronger than hate. Freedom is \r\nmightier than fear. We can do it. \r\nIsrael fights the fateful battle against the forces \r\nof militant Islam every day. We keep our borders safe \r\nfrom the Islamic State. We prevent the smuggling of \r\ngame-changing weapons to Hizbullah in Lebanon. We \r\nfoil Palestinian terror attacks in the West Bank. We \r\ndeter missile attacks from Hamas-controlled Gaza. \r\nThat is the same Hamas terror organization that \r\ncruelly — unbelievably cruelly — refuses to return \r\nthree of our citizens and the bodies of our fallen soldiers, \r\nOron Shaul and Hadar Goldin. Hadar Goldin’s parents, \r\nLeah and Simcha Goldin, are here with us today. They \r\nhave one request: to be able to bury their beloved son in \r\nIsrael. All they ask for is one simple thing: to be able to \r\nvisit the grave of their fallen son, Hadar, in Israel, but \r\nHamas refuses. Hamas could not care less. I implore \r\neveryone to stand with Hadar’s parents, with us, with \r\nall that is decent in our world against the inhumanity \r\nof Hamas, which represents all that is indecent and \r\nbarbaric. Hamas breaks every humanitarian rule in the \r\nbook. Throw the book at them. \r\nThe greatest threat to my country, to our region \r\nand ultimately to our world remains the militant \r\nIslamic regime of Iran. Iran openly seeks Israel’s \r\nannihilation. It threatens countries across the Middle \r\nEast. It sponsors terror worldwide. This year, Iran has \r\nfired ballistic missiles in direct defiance of Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2231 (2015). It has expanded its \r\nactivities in Iraq, Syria and in Yemen. Iran, the world’s \r\nforemost sponsor of terrorism, continues to build its \r\nglobal terror network. That terror network now spans \r\nfive continents. My point is as follows: the threat that \r\nIran poses to all of us is not behind us; it is in front of \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 33/46\r\nus. In the coming years, there must be a sustained and \r\nunited effort to push back against Iran’s aggression and \r\nterror. With the nuclear constraints on Iran one year \r\ncloser to being removed, let me be clear: Israel will not \r\nallow the terrorist regime in Iran to develop nuclear \r\nweapons — not now, not in a decade, not ever.\r\nI stand before the Assembly at a time when Israel’s \r\nformer President Shimon Peres is fighting for his life. \r\nShimon is one of Israel’s founding fathers, one of its \r\nboldest statesman and one of its most respected leaders. \r\nI know that the Assembly will join me and the people of \r\nIsrael in wishing him a speedy recovery. I have always \r\nadmired Shimon’s boundless optimism. Like him, I am \r\nfilled with hope. \r\nI am filled with hope because Israel is capable of \r\ndefending itself by itself against any threat. I am filled \r\nwith hope because the valour of our fighting men and \r\nwomen is second to none. I am filled with hope because \r\nI know that the forces of civilization will ultimately \r\ntriumph over the forces of terror. I am filled with hope \r\nbecause in the age of innovation, Israel, the innovation \r\nnation, is thriving like never before. I am filled with \r\nhope because Israel works tirelessly to advance equality \r\nand opportunity for all its citizens: Jews, Muslims, \r\nChristians, Druze, everyone. I am filled with hope \r\nbecause despite all the doubters, I believe that in the \r\nyears ahead Israel will forge a lasting peace with all \r\nour neighbours.\r\nI am hopeful about what Israel can accomplish \r\nbecause I have seen what Israel has accomplished. In \r\n1948, the year of Israel’s independence, our population \r\nwas 800,000. Our main export was oranges. People \r\nsaid that we were too small, too weak, too isolated \r\nand too demographically outnumbered to survive, let \r\nalone thrive. The sceptics were wrong about Israel then, \r\nand the sceptics are wrong about Israel now. Israel’s \r\npopulation has grown tenfold. Our economy has grown \r\nfortyfold. Today, our biggest export is technology. \r\nIsraeli technology powers the world’s computers, cell \r\nphones, cars and so much more.\r\nThe future belongs to those who innovate, and \r\nthat is why the future belongs to countries like Israel. \r\nIsrael wants to form partnerships in seizing that future, \r\nand so I call on all those present to embrace Israel, to \r\ncooperate and dream with Israel. Dream of the future \r\nthat we can build together — a future of breathtaking \r\nprogress, a future of security, prosperity and peace, a \r\nfuture of hope for all humankind, a future where even at \r\nthe United Nations, even in this Hall, Israel will finally, \r\ninevitably, take its rightful place among the nations. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Israel for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of the \r\nState of Israel, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Serge Telle, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Monaco\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Monaco.\r\nMr. Serge Telle, Head of Government of the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Serge \r\nTelle, Head of Government of the Principality of \r\nMonaco, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Telle (Monaco) (spoke in French): As we \r\nhave been hearing since the beginning of the week, \r\nwe are here as representatives of a world in crisis, a \r\nwar-torn world, divided by inequality, shocked by ever-\r\nincreasing massive population displacements, aff licted \r\nby hunger and disease, and torn apart and grief-stricken \r\nby violence. We are also the representatives of a world \r\nthreatened by global warming, made vulnerable by \r\nattacks on biodiversity, and concerned at new dangers \r\nsuch as ocean acidification and the melting of the \r\npermafrost.\r\nWe are doubly responsible for the situation of the \r\nworld. We are responsible as human beings, because \r\nthe tragedy has but one perpetrator — humans and \r\ntheir insatiable hunger for power. From the depletion \r\nof farmland to the f looding of land swallowed up by \r\nrising water levels and cities f lattened by bombs, it is \r\nalways the same quest for power that is the cause of \r\nglobal violence, which is why we are all responsible.\r\nBut we are also here as leaders of nations who are \r\nresponsible for the world’s future. It is up to us and the \r\nGeneral Assembly to find responses to the suffering, \r\ninjustice and other concerns. For 71 years, the United \r\nNations has shown that it is capable of taking up those \r\nproblems and offering the world sustainable solutions \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n34/46 16-29553\r\nbased on peace and cooperation. Over the past 10 years, \r\nunder the stewardship of the Secretary-General, to \r\nwhom I pay tribute, the United Nations has been at the \r\nforefront of all of the fights. Thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, significant progress has been made on \r\nsustainable development with the adoption one year ago \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nits 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and the \r\nadoption in December last year of a major agreement on \r\nclimate change, the Paris Agreement.\r\nThose accomplishments should inspire us today \r\nand strengthen our determination. In the face of the \r\ncontradictions that we face in the world, the United \r\nNations, I would note, is the only forum where coherent \r\nglobal action is possible. It is the only place where \r\nconflicting interests can have a peaceful encounter \r\nin a spirit of progress. It is the only place where \r\nresponsibility for humankind can be upheld over \r\nthe ambition of individuals. Here, and nowhere else, \r\nhumankind has a meeting with history, with destiny \r\nand with the judgment that our children will pronounce \r\non its actions.\r\nThe Principality of Monaco, under the impetus of its \r\nsovereign Prince, Prince Albert II, is fully committed \r\nto multilateralism as the only way of tackling the topics \r\non our agenda. I would like to mention three such issues \r\nthat encompass most of the world’s challenges.\r\nThe first is of course the issue of refugees and \r\nmigrants, a topic that took up a large part of the \r\nbeginning of the work of the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly. All of us here are familiar \r\nwith the tragedy that has aff licted so many civilian \r\npopulations, primarily in Africa and the Middle East, \r\nand we know all too well the situation of the Syrian \r\npopulation, the 300,000 victims of the conflict and the \r\ntragedy of the survivors, caught in the middle of the \r\nviolence committed by the State and the atrocities of \r\nthe terrorists. Every month, every week, every day, the \r\nMediterranean becomes the funeral shroud of dozens \r\nof women, children and men ready to risk everything to \r\nescape their fate, but for whom we can barely provide \r\nthe little that they ask for — safety, subsistence and the \r\nhope of a better future.\r\nThat Mediterranean Sea, to which Monaco attaches \r\ngreat importance, the Sea that is both a link and a \r\nborder to so many worlds, is once again at the heart \r\nof one of the main challenges of this new century. The \r\nMediterranean today should help us understand that \r\nthe tragedies on its shores are not those of different \r\nclashing worlds but rather the shores of the same world, \r\nours. Regardless of our material situation or where we \r\nlive, we cannot escape Earth’s and humankind’s woes. \r\nWhether we are dealing with wars or rising water levels, \r\nfamines, storms or fanaticism, our interdependence is, \r\nfrom here on out, total. To quote John Donne, “Send not \r\nto know for whom the bell tolls, it tolls for thee.”\r\nThat is the purpose of the United Nations and \r\nits Charter — to proclaim our common humanity, \r\nwhatever difficulties may arise. In that regard, the \r\nNew York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants \r\n(resolution 71/1), which has just been adopted, \r\nfortunately recalls the principles according to which \r\nwe must act, as well as the moral and legal obligations \r\nthat we must all comply with. In that connection, we \r\nmust give special consideration to unaccompanied \r\nminors and children separated from their families. \r\nFurthermore, many people live in damaged ecosystems \r\nthat threaten their very existence. According to the \r\nmost recent projections of the United Nations, there \r\nmay be as many as 250 million climate refugees by \r\n2050. Therefore, environmental degradation could \r\ntomorrow become the primary cause of migration. \r\nHence, the importance of protecting our environment \r\nand implementing sustainable development for all. \r\nThat represents a major commitment for Monaco and \r\nour Sovereign Prince Albert II, who for more than 20 \r\nyears has been personally committed to that issue, \r\nboth in all international forums where those subjects \r\nwere addressed and in the field, working closely with \r\naffected populations.\r\nReconciling the imperatives of human development \r\nand those of the conservation of the Earth so as to make \r\nit possible for a population of 8 or 9 billion people in a \r\nfew years to live together will be the major challenge \r\nof our century. In order to achieve that, we must first \r\nprotect the climate. \r\nThe Paris Agreement, for which the Principality \r\ncampaigned, represents a milestone. Monaco will \r\nbecome party to that Agreement by the end of 2016, \r\nonce its National Council has adopted the law for its \r\nratification. I also recall that Monaco is committed to \r\nreducing its greenhouse-gas emissions by 50 per cent \r\nby 2030 as compared with emission levels in 1990.\r\nDespite its small responsibility for global emissions, \r\nour country has the ambition to be a leader in using \r\ninnovative means of transport and energy consumption. \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 35/46\r\nIn addition to preserving our common heritage and to \r\nlimiting pollution, the use of inexhaustible renewable \r\nenergy will also allow us to break with certain \r\nmonopolies that generate inequalities today and \r\ndestabilize our world. Such a programme of energy \r\ntransfer has a cost, but we are convinced that that cost \r\nis small compared to the consequences of inaction. That \r\nis why Monaco is committed to maintaining its support \r\nfor the Green Climate Fund.\r\nGlobal warming has several tragic consequences. \r\nOne of them is related to the situation of the oceans. As \r\nwe know, the sea surfaces have been severely neglected, \r\neven though they are critical for our common future. \r\nMonaco has a long-standing commitment to that issue, \r\ndating back to Prince Albert I, who was one of the \r\nfounders of modern oceanography over 100 years ago. \r\nSince then, the Principality has taken action whenever \r\nthe future of our seas was at stake. It did so in 2009, \r\nwhen it hosted 150 international scientists, who signed \r\nthe Monaco Declaration, the first global warning about \r\nthe acidification of the oceans. It also acted by taking \r\non various targeted initiatives within the competent \r\nbodies, such as the one that made it possible for us to \r\nsave bluefin tuna in the Mediterranean. It also acted \r\nthrough the appeal, launched by Prince Albert II at \r\nthe General Assembly in 2013, aimed at including \r\nwhat became Sustainable Development Goal 14 on the \r\noceans in the 2030 Agenda. It continues to take action, \r\nmonth after month, by contributing to the development \r\nof protected coastal marine areas and to the future \r\nestablishment of a network of protected areas on the \r\nhigh seas.\r\nWe are convinced that such conservation solutions \r\nwill bring about extremely positive effects for the \r\necosystems and the populations that are directly \r\nor potentially affected. Similarly, the Principality \r\nof Monaco has taken action in the very important \r\nnegotiations that are taking place today at the \r\nUnited Nations on issues of biodiversity and national \r\njurisdiction.\r\nAll of those issues are essential for the Principality \r\nof Monaco. All of those issues take into account a \r\nprimordial concern, which is the creation of our common \r\nfuture. It was through their ability to dominate and \r\ntransform nature that our ancestors were able to develop \r\nand secure the future of their children. However, we \r\nmust now also admit that it is through our capacity to \r\nprotect nature and accept its rules that we can realize \r\nour potential and build a future for humankind. That \r\nchange in the model disrupts our ways of thinking. \r\nIt will take time for it to take hold and to replace the \r\ntraditional ways of thinking that have shaped our world \r\nand its inhabitants for millenniums.\r\nWhat we need to do today is to bring about a \r\nchange of civilization. However, we can make progress \r\nin that direction only if all of humankind comes along \r\nwith us with its dreams and desires. The 2016 UNESCO \r\nGlobal Education Monitoring Report also highlights a \r\npriority — that of education. Forty per cent of 15-year-\r\nold children have basic knowledge of environmental \r\nissues. That brings me to the third issue for our \r\nOrganization that I would like to underscore today \r\nbefore the Assembly. \r\nMore than ever, UNICEF, which is celebrating \r\nits seventieth anniversary this year, should play a \r\ncentral role in solving the world’s problems, many of \r\nwhich relate to women and children. At a time when \r\nwomen are still subjected to so much violence and \r\ndiscrimination and when sexual violence is increasing \r\nin such an unacceptable way, we should also support \r\nthe crucial work of UNICEF. In that respect, I would \r\nalso like to reiterate the full support of the Principality \r\nof Monaco for the Security Council resolutions on \r\nwomen and peace and security, on the protection of \r\nwomen in times of conflict and the strengthening of \r\ntheir role in peacekeeping, restoring peace and building \r\nof peace. In our unstable and unjust world, we know \r\nthat education, especially that of girls, is the solution \r\nto many of the problems we face. It is through women \r\nthat the values of tolerance and respect can be upheld. \r\nThat is why the education of girls and, more broadly, \r\nthe equal education of all children should be a priority \r\nfor all. \r\nThe power of the United Nations lies in bringing \r\nStates together to work in the service of the common \r\ngood. That common good is today still high on the \r\nagenda of the Assembly. We must better manage \r\nrefugees and migrants by protecting the planet and \r\nthrough education for children and the establishment \r\nof a genuine equality between men and women. That \r\nis the path that Monaco will follow. Loyal to its values, \r\nits history and its commitments, the Principality of \r\nMonaco will continue, with determination, to move \r\nforward along that path, together with the entire \r\ninternational community, for a better future.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n36/46 16-29553\r\nHead of Government of the Principality of Monaco for \r\nthe statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Serge Telle, Head of Government of the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum. \r\nAddress by Mr. Tammam Salam, President of the \r\nCouncil of Ministers of the Lebanese Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Council of Ministers of the Lebanese Republic. \r\nMr. Tammam Salam, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Lebanese Republic, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Tammam Salam, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Lebanese Republic, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly. \r\nMr. Salam (Lebanon) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, allow me to congratulate the President on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session. Allow me also to thank \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft for his tireless efforts throughout \r\nhis presidency during the seventieth session. I would \r\nalso like to extend special thanks to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon. We thank him for his annual report on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/71/1) and for the high \r\npriority that he has given to the issues of the Middle \r\nEast and Lebanon. \r\nI take this opportunity to reiterate Lebanon’s \r\ncommitment to assuming its role in achieving the lofty \r\ngoals of the Organization. My country had the honour \r\nto have been among its founding Members. Foremost \r\namong those goals is the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity, the promotion of world peace, securing the \r\nright of peoples to self-determination and ensuring \r\nrespect for human rights. \r\nIn 2016 we have witnessed tremendous international \r\nefforts to mobilize goodwill, reduce the number of \r\narmed conflicts and strengthen communities. Such \r\nefforts have come about either under the auspices or \r\nwith the contribution of the United Nations, with the \r\ngoal of improving the international community’s \r\nability to meet the unprecedented challenges that are \r\nthe mark of our era. Perhaps the most noble milestones \r\nwere the signing by 175 States of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, which took place in April, and the \r\nholding of the World Humanitarian Summit, which was \r\nheld in Istanbul in May.\r\nLebanon emphasizes the need to reactivate and \r\nrevitalize the role of the General Assembly so as to \r\nmake it more effective in addressing issues of concern \r\nto the whole of humankind. Lebanon laments that the \r\nSecurity Council has repeatedly failed to address the \r\nconflicts raging in many countries, particularly in \r\nthe Middle East. Lebanon stresses the importance of \r\nreforming the Security Council in a way that would \r\nreflect the latest political, economic and demographic \r\nrealities emerging in our world.\r\nMy country is undergoing a severe political crisis, \r\nthe most salient aspect of which is the inability of \r\nParliament for the past two and a half years to elect a \r\nPresident of the Republic. The crisis has led to the near \r\nparalysis of the legislative authorities and the slowdown \r\nof the work of the executive branch. It has also had \r\nnegative repercussions on our economic situation.\r\nAll countries that consider themselves brothers and \r\nfriends of Lebanon — all those who are familiar with \r\nthe Lebanese scene — are well aware of the specificities \r\nof the political situation in my country and the extent \r\nto which it is influenced by external factors. The main \r\nexternal factor has been sharp regional polarization, \r\nwhich has turned into an open conflict in the entire \r\nregion. Realism compels us to recognize that the \r\nsolution to the problem of the presidential vacancy is \r\nnot just in the hands of the Lebanese. I therefore call on \r\nall of Lebanon’s friends and supporters and all who are \r\nkeen to avoid the emergence of a new area of tension in \r\nthe Middle East to help the Lebanese elect a President \r\nof the country. The election of a new President will help \r\nrebalance our constitutional institutions and protect \r\nthe Lebanese model of coexistence, which is the last \r\nsurviving model based on plurality in the Levant. \r\nWe reiterate that the distressing war in Syria \r\nhas produced a displacement crisis that has imposed \r\nan unbearable burden on Lebanon that exceeds our \r\ncapacities. My country, with its limited surface area, \r\nis hosting numbers of displaced Syrians equivalent \r\nto one third of our population. We are shouldering \r\nour humanitarian duty towards those people with our \r\nlimited resources and with insufficient support from \r\nthe international community. We are disappointed with \r\nthe level of international response to our needs as a host \r\ncountry — a response that is not commensurate with \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 37/46\r\nthe pledges made or the goodwill expressed on so many \r\noccasions. \r\nLebanon cannot and will not assimilate additional \r\ndisplaced persons. Lebanon urges the United Nations \r\nto craft an overarching vision for resettling displaced \r\nSyrians living in our territory in areas inside Syria and \r\nfor working with the parties concerned to turn such a \r\nvision into a workable plan at the earliest possible time. \r\nAs we await the realization of that plan, we stress once \r\nmore the temporary character of the Syrian presence in \r\nLebanon. Let me declare that Lebanon is not a country \r\nof permanent asylum. Lebanon is the homeland of the \r\nLebanese and only the Lebanese. \r\nLebanon continues to suffer from the threat of \r\nterrorism. Lebanon is engaged in an open confrontation \r\nwith terrorism — a confrontation for which we have \r\npaid dearly with the lives of our soldiers, civilians and \r\nchildren. We declare a commitment to fight the scourge \r\nin all its forms. We stress the importance of regional \r\nand international cooperation in that fight. \r\nWe believe that the isolationist tendencies of some \r\ncommunities — retreating behind separation walls with \r\nthe unhealthy encouragement of Islamophobia — are \r\naimed at an Islam that is being deceitfully brandished \r\nand branded by terrorists to justify their crimes. Such \r\nisolationist tendencies do not represent a panacea against \r\nterrorism. Rather, they are a recipe for the emergence \r\nof violent, extremist and racist tendencies, which have \r\nbeen rejected by advanced democracies for a long \r\ntime. Combating terrorism is a long-term process that \r\nrequires major efforts at all levels. A precondition for the \r\nsuccessful elimination of the terrorist phenomenon lies \r\nin eradicating its roots and the contributing factors that \r\nfuel it. We ought to address deprivation and injustice, \r\nwhich are the incubators of extremism, by meeting \r\nthe legitimate demands of people for freedom, dignity \r\nand equality and by rejecting all forms of violence and \r\nexclusion. \r\nOn the tenth anniversary of the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1701 (2006), Lebanon \r\nreiterates its commitment to that resolution with \r\nall its provisions. Once again, Lebanon calls on the \r\ninternational community to compel Israel to cease its \r\nviolations of Lebanese sovereignty, to fully cooperate \r\nwith the United Nations peacekeeping forces and the \r\nUnited Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, to demarcate \r\nwhat is left of the Blue Line and to withdraw from the \r\nnorthern part of Ghajar, the Shaba’a farmlands and the \r\nKfar Shouba Hills. \r\nLebanon reiterates its strong determination to \r\nsafeguard its full rights over its water and natural \r\nresources, including oil and gas, within its exclusive \r\neconomic zone. Lebanon called on the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, during his visit to Beirut last March, to make \r\nuse of his good offices in resolving the issue of the \r\ndelimitation of the exclusive economic zone between \r\nLebanon and Israel. We look forward to his heightened \r\nrole in that area. \r\nWe condemn Israel’s continuing occupation of the \r\nPalestinian land and its blockade of the Gaza Strip, as \r\nwell as its obstruction of the efforts to rebuild what was \r\ndestroyed by the Israeli aggression in the summer of \r\n2014. We call for the principle of legal accountability to \r\nbe applied in the case of the war crimes committed by \r\nIsrael, to prevent those crimes from going unpunished.\r\nWe hold Israel responsible for foiling all attempts \r\nto reach a peaceful settlement, and we stress the need \r\nfor a just, comprehensive and lasting solution to the \r\nconflict, based on Security Council resolutions 242 \r\n(1967) and 338 (1973), the Madrid terms of reference, \r\nincluding the principle of land for peace, and the \r\nArab Peace Initiative. We furthermore stress the right \r\nof Palestinian refugees to return home, pursuant to \r\ninternational resolutions. \r\nAt this very moment, as I speak before the \r\nAssembly, a major cycle of violence continues to rage \r\nin the Arab Levant, causing the destruction of homes \r\nand livelihoods, hospitals and places of worship. \r\nCommunities are being uprooted from their homelands \r\nand hurled into the abyss of an unknown future. Great \r\ncities are being razed to the ground and erased from \r\nthe map without any consideration for their historical \r\nimportance, or indeed their human heritage value. \r\nWe renew our call to all influential Powers to cease \r\nprocrastinating and hesitating and to assume their \r\nresponsibilities by acting with determination to stop \r\nthe bloodshed and restore security and stability in our \r\nregion. We appeal to everyone to join wholeheartedly \r\nand effectively in the fight against obscurantist \r\nterrorism. We warn against the dangers of tampering \r\nwith maps, demolishing existing entities and changing \r\nthe demographic nature of communities or threatening \r\ntheir social cohesion and religious diversity. \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n38/46 16-29553\r\nWe believe that the main prerequisite for \r\nconsolidating stability and eliminating hotbeds of \r\nextremism in the Middle East is to meet the just demands \r\nof the people to live independently, with dignity and \r\nfreedom, and to find a just solution to the Palestinian \r\ncause. We would like to stress the importance of \r\nestablishing peaceful relations among the countries of \r\nthe region, based on good-neighbourliness, respect for \r\nthe sovereignty of other countries and the principle of \r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs. We call for \r\nthe promotion of the culture of peace and dialogue to \r\nprotect the oases of diversity in the Levant. \r\nAmid the violent maelstrom that is sweeping across \r\nthe Levant, where everything is in f lux and endless \r\nwaves of displaced persons are leaving their homes \r\nand communities, a small entity called Lebanon stands \r\nfirm against the aftershocks of the crisis that is tearing \r\neverything apart around it, and offers the world a model \r\nother than that which is intended to prove the inability \r\nof our region to tolerate the possibility of coexistence \r\namong different entities. \r\nLebanon is a shining star, an example of affinity \r\namong various affiliations and a model totally opposed \r\nto the notion of a single-colour racist State that rejects \r\nall other shades. It is a laboratory of partnership at \r\na time when sects, nationalities and ethnicities are \r\nfighting one another and populations are f leeing their \r\ncountries. Yet that model is suffering from political \r\nweakness and needs the world to offer it a helping \r\nhand. Meanwhile, the Lebanese people will remain in \r\nthe heart of the oppressed Levant — firmly committed \r\nto living together in one unified State. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Council of Ministers of the Lebanese \r\nRepublic for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tammam Salam, President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of the Lebanese Republic, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Haider Al Abadi, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Iraq\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Iraq.\r\nMr. Haider Al Abadi, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Iraq, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Haider \r\nAl Abadi, Prime Minister of the Republic of Iraq, and \r\ninviting him to address the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Al Abadi (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): A year \r\nago, as I stood at this rostrum (A/70/PV.21), large \r\nareas of Iraqi territory were occupied by the terrorist \r\norganization Da’esh. Today, as we stand here again, we \r\nare able to declare before the General Assembly that \r\nIraq is being liberated and that Iraqis have been able to \r\nfree most of their land and towns, thanks to their unity \r\nand determination. Currently we are in the process \r\nof liberating Ninawa, the last province controlled by \r\nDa’esh, where we have regained major areas. We shall \r\ncomplete its liberation by the end of the year. \r\nLet me report that today our heroic forces liberated \r\nthe city of Al-Sharqat in Salahaddin province and other \r\nneighbouring areas and major towns. That is testimony \r\nto the great confidence and capabilities of our forces, \r\nwho enjoy the full support of the local residents. I \r\ncommend all of the valiant soldiers who are working \r\nto liberate peaceful Iraq from the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Levant (ISIL). We have declared 2016 as a \r\nyear of liberation and victory. Our fundamental goal \r\nis to liberate our people and the land and to save the \r\ncivilians from ISIL, which has ruined all aspects of life \r\nand destroyed archaeological monuments of the ancient \r\ncivilization of Mesopotamia. \r\nAssisted by our friends in the international \r\ncommunity, we have started to implement programmes \r\nfor the return of internally displaced persons (IDPs) to \r\nthe liberated areas. In that context, we developed an \r\nintegrated programme for stabilization and the provision \r\nof services, particularly water, electricity, schools and \r\nhospitals. We call on the international community to \r\nprovide further support for sheltering and returning \r\nIDPs, especially in the light of the forthcoming battle to \r\nfully liberate Ninawa and the anticipated increase in the \r\nnumber of displaced persons. We thank all those who \r\nhave stood beside our people in the face of economic \r\nand security challenges, and we look forward to further \r\nsupport and collaboration. \r\nWe would commend the United Nations system for \r\nproviding humanitarian assistance to the people of Iraq \r\nand for its role in addressing IDP issues. We applaud \r\nthe support extended by the States of the international \r\ncoalition aimed at tackling terrorism, as well as of \r\nfriendly countries. We commend the World Bank, the \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 39/46\r\nInternational Monetary Fund and other international \r\norganizations for supporting the plans and efforts of \r\nthe Iraqi Government to reform the Iraqi economy, \r\novercome the financial crisis and fight corruption in \r\nall its forms. We greatly appreciate the constructive \r\nposition of the Group of Seven States and thank the \r\ndonors conference for the reconstruction of Iraq \r\nrecently held in Washington, D.C. \r\nIn the area of economic and financial reforms, \r\nthe Government implemented an ambitious reform \r\nprogramme to reduce government expenditure, despite \r\nhaving to spend more to support the war against \r\nterrorism. As part of its administrative reforms, \r\nthe Government initiated the restructuring of many \r\nState institutions. It prioritized citizens’ services by \r\nstreamlining procedures, removing many obstacles, \r\nsimplifying the procedures to deal with citizens’ \r\naffairs and removing impediments to investment. The \r\nGovernment also strengthened procedures for creating \r\nprivate-sector partnerships and had a good measure of \r\nsuccess in that regard.\r\nAs for fighting corruption, we have signed a \r\nmemorandum of understanding with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme to benefit from international \r\nexpertise to aid Iraq in capacity-building to fight \r\ncorruption. The past few weeks have seen practical \r\nsteps in that regard. We look forward to making \r\nmore progress in fighting terrorism and bringing the \r\nperpetrators to justice. \r\nWe look forward to the day when Iraq and the whole \r\nregion are free of the criminal acts perpetrated by the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). But we will \r\nbe satisfied only when the whole world becomes free \r\nfrom terrorism that threatens our peoples and nations. \r\nThis requires serious collaboration to contain terrorism, \r\ncut off its ideological and financial resources and \r\ndismantle its networks and recruitment hubs all over \r\nthe world. Without such cooperation, terrorism will \r\nspread everywhere, giving rise to increased numbers \r\nof refugees f leeing conflict areas. Those numbers have \r\nalready reached unprecedentedly high levels.\r\nWe assure Member States that ISIL is indisputably \r\na greater enemy of Islam than of other faiths. ISIL has \r\nmurdered thousands of Muslims, wrought destruction \r\nand spread its evil to many Arab and Islamic States. It has \r\nbeen active in capitals and cities worldwide — killing \r\nand terrorizing civilians in France, Belgium, Germany, \r\nthe United States of America, Russia and elsewhere. \r\nWe have no choice but to cooperate to win the war \r\nagainst these evil terrorists. We deem any victory \r\nachieved against ISIL anywhere in the world to be a \r\nglobal triumph.\r\nThe danger of the formation of terrorist organizations \r\nsuch as Al-Qaida or Da’esh/ISIL will not end until \r\nwe address the problem of their radical ideology. \r\nThese backward groups rely on sectarian segregation \r\nand hostility towards all other faiths and beliefs, and \r\ntheir ideology is fuelled by a short-sighted vision that \r\nhas hindered national development opportunities. If \r\nwe are to combat this pernicious scourge, which has \r\nspread among some young people and exploited their \r\nfeelings of disaffection and despair, countries and \r\norganizations must take a determined stand. They must \r\nreview the programmes and curriculums of educational \r\ninstitutions and address feelings of frustration, with a \r\nview to absorbing disaffected young people into the \r\nmainstream of society. Any attempts by such terrorist \r\norganizations to re-establish themselves in future must \r\nbe pre-empted.\r\nISIL, which falsely claims that it is defending \r\nSunnis, has so far killed Shiites, Sunnis, Christians, \r\nYazidis, Arabs, Kurds and Turkmens, and Shabak \r\nas well. Their atrocities have been directed at the \r\nentire ethnic spectrum of Iraq and involved takfir, \r\ndisplacement, female enslavement, genocide and the \r\ndestruction of antiquities, mosques and churches. Such \r\nheinous crimes were perpetrated against cities, such as \r\nAmerly, Sinjar, Taza, Anbar, Mosul, Salahuddin and \r\nDiyala, and against the victims of the Camp Speicher \r\nmassacre, not to mention the cowardly terrorist attacks \r\non civilians in the districts of Baghdad and the rest of \r\nIraq’s provinces.\r\nIraq encountered two external factors that affected \r\nstability and economic and social growth. Apart from \r\nterrorism, we have had to face the global decline in oil \r\nprices, which caused a budget loss amounting to 70 per \r\ncent of revenues, in addition to the burden of increased \r\nmilitary and security expenditures to free Iraqi cities \r\nfrom terrorism and to rebuild them. It was only \r\nnatural that this would negatively impact development, \r\ninvestment and reconstruction plans. Despite all these \r\ndaunting challenges, we continued to implement our \r\ncomprehensive reform programme and to combat the \r\ncorruption that corrodes our State agencies and social \r\ninstitutions. From the outset, we realized that this reform \r\nprogramme would be no less difficult and dangerous \r\nthan tackling terrorism. However, we are determined \r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n40/46 16-29553\r\nthat it will be implemented despite all the challenges. \r\nWe are confident that we can win the battle of reforms, \r\njust as we won the battle to liberate our lands.\r\nWe and our people stand together shoulder to \r\nshoulder in our fight against terrorism and corruption. \r\nWe are working together to build a State that is based \r\non peaceful coexistence and respect for religious, \r\nideological and sectarian diversity, guided by the \r\nvalues and principles of justice and equality. Each Iraqi \r\ncontributes to the victory achieved in the fight against \r\nISIL. It is a national and non-conventional, existential \r\nbattle, involving all the Iraqi people. Our armed forces, \r\nfederal and local police, the popular mobilization \r\nforces, the tribal mobilization forces and the Peshmerga \r\nforces represent all religions, ethnicities and sects; they \r\nshare one goal, namely, to defend our homeland and \r\nits sacred values. Our religious leader, His Eminence \r\nthe Grand Ayatollah Sayyid Ali al-Sistani, supported \r\nthis defence. His historic fatwa led to a broad-based \r\nmobilization of the entire Iraqi people, and religious \r\nleaders and clergy of all religious creeds in Iraq widely \r\nembraced and supported the fatwa.\r\nIraq is keen to participate alongside all countries \r\nin advancing development efforts and attaining the \r\nSustainable Development Goals — combating poverty \r\nand discrimination, protecting the environment, \r\nenhancing child-care programmes and improving \r\nstandards of health and education. Our intent is to \r\ncreate an environment that promotes freedom, human \r\nrights, equality and the vitally important participation \r\nof women in the State and society.\r\nWe call on nations worldwide to commit to \r\nimplementing the relevant Security Council resolutions \r\non preventing support to, financing or arming terrorist \r\ngroups that kill civilians, as well as General Assembly \r\nresolutions on safeguarding Iraq’s cultural heritage. \r\nThanks to a cooperative effort between Iraq and \r\nUNESCO, the wetland areas of southern Iraq have now \r\nbeen added to the list of World Heritage sites. We are \r\nalso keen to meet the inclusion requirements for the \r\nrest of the cultural sites and treasures of Iraq’s ancient \r\ncivilization.\r\nWe take this opportunity to call on the international \r\ncommunity to exert efforts to end conflicts, prevent wars, \r\nsupport peace and security, encourage development \r\nopportunities and reject policies involving interference \r\nin the internal affairs of other States. Such policies \r\nresult in more suffering among our peoples and deeper \r\ndivisions in our region, which continues to be racked by \r\ninternal wars and external interventions that have made \r\nour civilian populations ever more miserable.\r\nWe appeal to the international community to \r\nsupport and respect Iraq’s sovereignty and to demand \r\nthat Turkey withdraw its forces from our territory, \r\nwhere their continued presence, despite the fact that \r\nIraqis have rejected it, is an obstacle to our efforts to \r\nliberate Ninawa.\r\nThe Iraqi Government is working hard to help \r\nthe Iraqi people live in peaceful coexistence with one \r\nanother and to treat all citizens equally on a basis of \r\ngood citizenship, regardless of their religion, sect or \r\nethnicity. We would like to reiterate our gratitude to the \r\nUnited Nations and our friends for their support to Iraq \r\nand the Iraqi people through their various humanitarian \r\nprogrammes aimed at caring for displaced people and \r\nrefugees. We also thank them for their support of the \r\nIraqi Government’s efforts to achieve security and \r\nstability and the reforms and economic development \r\nthat our people aspire to.\r\nWe would like to congratulate the President on \r\nhis election to lead the Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession. We would also like to thank Mr. Lykketoft for \r\nhis leadership at the seventieth session, and to warmly \r\ncongratulate the Secretary-General on the forthcoming \r\nconclusion of his term of office at the end of this year. \r\nWe pay tribute to him for his excellent stewardship of \r\nthe United Nations. He has visited Iraq many times, and \r\nwe thank him for his support of our development plans.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Iraq for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Haider Al Abadi, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Iraq, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Albert Koenders, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Kingdom of the Netherlands.\r\nMr. Koenders (Netherlands): Before I came here, \r\nSahar Afzal, a representative of Dutch youth, asked \r\nme a simple question. “Minister,” he said, “do you still \r\nbelieve in the United Nations?” That question made me \r\nthink. A plain and simple yes is the answer one would \r\nprobably expect from the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Kingdom of the Netherlands, a nation with a strong \r\ntradition of cooperation, dialogue and partnership and a \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 41/46\r\nfounding Member of the United Nations, with an active \r\ncommitment to peace, justice and development. But my \r\nanswer was not that simple. The English art critic Clive \r\nBell wrote that while we believe, what we believe is not \r\nnecessarily true. There can be a lot of wishful thinking \r\nin believing something. Believing is not always enough. \r\nIt is what we do that matters. And so it is when we look \r\nat the United Nations, as the world’s premier global \r\nmultilateral organization.\r\nThere is widespread agreement that the United \r\nNations needs to reassert and transform itself, and \r\nI think that is correct. The challenges are enormous; \r\naccording to some, the world is at a tipping point. \r\nAnd the outlook is indeed gloomy. Geopolitical fault \r\nlines are deepening. Shifts in the global economy are \r\nfuelling tension and uncertainty. Growth has stagnated. \r\nInequality within and among countries has grown. \r\nWorldwide, the number of refugees is the highest it \r\nhas been since the founding of the United Nations. \r\nPromising democracy movements have turned into \r\nbloody conflicts, and new wars have broken out, the \r\nmost tragic examples being the conflict in Syria and the \r\nbrutal extremism of the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. \r\nTerrorism has taken a deadly toll in many places around \r\nthe world, including on my continent, Europe. Violence \r\nagainst women in war zones and elsewhere is a scourge.\r\nThere is no denying it — too many people in \r\nthe world have drawn the short straw. In a world of \r\nglobalization, climate change and conflict, they are \r\nlosing out. The longer we permit that to go on, the \r\nfurther we drift from the inclusive United Nations \r\nideal of “we the peoples”. Not “we, some people”, but \r\n“we the peoples”. Will we be able to strengthen our \r\npositive forces, or will we let the negative forces tear \r\nthe world apart? At this pivotal moment in history, the \r\nUnited Nations and the other institutions that were \r\nbuilt to bring us together must be strong enough to \r\nprevent that from happening. But are they? The idea \r\nof unstoppable, progressive global integration has lost \r\nits aura of inevitability. On my own continent, the \r\nprocess of European cooperation is being debated. In \r\nmany places inside and outside Europe, ghosts of the \r\npast have come back to haunt us — nationalism and \r\nxenophobia. And when I see the kinds of stories about \r\nthe United Nations that are being reported in my own \r\ncountry, the Netherlands — which has traditionally \r\nbeen a very strong supporter — I realize that the United \r\nNations is too often seen as helpless and fragmented, an \r\noverwhelmed Organization struggling to cope with the \r\nchallenges it faces.\r\nAnd yet the United Nations has no choice but \r\nto play a key role in delivering solutions, now and \r\nin future, in order to make the world safer, more \r\njust and better prepared for what the future brings. \r\nThere is no alternative. The United Nations is the \r\nbest imperfect global Organization we have, the only \r\nglobal Organization that embodies the principles \r\nof multilateralism — legitimacy, universality and \r\nstandard-setting authority and that has not only \r\nconvening power, which is very important, but also the \r\nability to deliver services on a global scale.\r\nWhat must be done? As the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange and, only this week, the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) have \r\nshown, the United Nations remains the one legitimate \r\ninstitution where international goals and ambitions are \r\nset and where we can agree on new global challenges. \r\nBut now is the time for implementation. We must walk \r\nthe talk. I know that implementation is not always \r\nvery sexy. It does not often make headlines. It is not \r\nusually accompanied by Angélique Kidjo or Shakira \r\nsinging onstage, as they did last year in this very Hall \r\nduring the magnificent adoption of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. But implementation \r\nis necessary to deliver on the goals we set, and it is \r\nnecessary for the Organization to remain relevant and \r\ncredible — to survive.\r\nThat is why I believe that a shift from outcome \r\ndocuments to action and execution should be the \r\ntop priority of both the United Nations membership \r\nand the new Secretary-General. The new Secretary-\r\nGeneral should be an “Implementer-General”, \r\nworking on the basis of a twenty-first-century vision \r\nof global cooperation. There is plenty of work to \r\ndo. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon is leaving his \r\nsuccessor an impressive body of standards, objectives \r\nand recommendations, and the Netherlands is grateful \r\nfor his enormous leadership during a very difficult \r\nperiod. The new Secretary-General can hit the ground \r\nrunning and boost further implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda and the Paris Agreement, of peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding reform, including real zero tolerance \r\nfor sexual exploitation and abuse, as well as the very \r\nimportant issue of reform of the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system.\r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n42/46 16-29553\r\nBut the Secretary-General cannot do it alone. The \r\nmembership must shoulder its responsibilities. At a \r\ntime of so many false notes, we need to work on our \r\nglobal orchestra. Maybe the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations should declare a moratorium on new \r\nand lofty outcome documents until we have delivered \r\non the commitments and promises made in the ones that \r\nwe already have adopted. Let us pause in the talk for a \r\nwhile and get the action going for the people whom we \r\nrepresent.\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands is ready to support \r\nthe new Secretary-General in a drive for implementation. \r\nImplementation is not just technique; it is mastering the \r\npolitical will to get things done. We have made a good \r\nstart with the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development in our own country. We look \r\nforward to sharing our national voluntary presentation \r\nwith the membership next summer. Globally, we are \r\ncommitted to an integrated approach to peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights that leaves no \r\none behind. The Netherlands is a top-10 humanitarian \r\ndonor, a supporter of and a contributor to peacekeeping. \r\nWe will ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nshortly. We would like the migration compact and \r\nthe refugee compact provided for in the New York \r\nDeclaration on Migrants and Refugees to be clear and \r\nactionable.\r\nUnited Nations reform needs to pick up steam now. \r\nThe Security Council continues to fulfil a crucial role, \r\nimperfect as it may be. But it is no longer 1945. The \r\nCouncil is simply not representative enough. We need \r\nto devise a way to fix that shortcoming before it is too \r\nlate, even if it means thinking outside the box. As the \r\nAssembly may recall, I have suggested that a Council \r\nseat be assigned to the European Union in due course, \r\nand I invite other regions to also reflect on collective \r\nregional representation on the Council.\r\nThe right of the veto should not render the Security \r\nCouncil powerless, especially when — as we see every \r\nday, including this week — mass atrocities are being \r\ncommitted. Council members should be more conscious \r\nof their responsibilities and be held more accountable \r\nif they block action against breaches of international \r\nhumanitarian law. Last year’s important reviews — and \r\nI think they were very important — of peace operations \r\nand peacebuilding underline the primacy of political \r\nsolutions and of sustaining the peace. I could not agree \r\nmore. \r\nMore focus on conflict prevention is also needed. \r\nIndeed, this community has been underlining the \r\nneed for conflict prevention for 50 years. Successful \r\npreventive diplomacy can keep situations of concern \r\nfrom spiralling out of control. It can keep cases from \r\nbeing added to the Council’s agenda; once a case is \r\ntaken up by the Security Council — let us face it — we \r\nin a sense have already collectively failed. We need to \r\nmake sure that there are sufficient resources for political \r\nmissions, mediation and other preventive actions. In \r\nits recent report, the Independent Commission on \r\nMultilateralism recommends a fundraising drive for \r\nprevention. While that is an admirable suggestion, I \r\nwould say that what is needed is not fundraising for \r\nprevention, but budgeting for prevention. If we agree \r\nthat conflict prevention is crucial to the mandate of \r\nthe United Nations, then we must devote sufficient \r\nresources to it from the regular budget, through \r\nassessed contributions by all Member States and not \r\njust through the extrabudgetary generosity of a few. \r\nThat may require a thorough review and reprioritization \r\nof the way in which budget resources are allocated at \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe points that I am making are part of an integrated \r\napproach that my country has long advocated, including \r\nduring our previous term on the Security Council. \r\nWe intend to pursue that approach during our 2018 \r\nCouncil term as well. Conflicts cannot be resolved \r\nunless the root causes are addressed. Peace, justice \r\nand development are closely interlinked and should \r\nnot be dealt with in isolation. The Peacebuilding Fund, \r\nwhich was established in 2005, is a good example of an \r\nintegrated approach to sustaining peace, as the great \r\npledging conference that we held yesterday illustrates. I \r\nam pleased to say that, earlier this week, the Netherlands \r\npledged €10 million to the Fund. The growing \r\nrecognition of the importance of accountability is \r\nanother example. There can be no durable peace without \r\njustice and respect for human rights. Tomorrow I will \r\ndeposit the instrument of ratification of the Kampala \r\namendments to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court on the crime of aggression.\r\nOther Security Council priorities for the Kingdom \r\nof the Netherlands in 2018 include the protection \r\nof civilians and addressing the peace and security \r\nimplications of climate change. As a Kingdom \r\nconsisting of one low-lying country, the Netherlands, \r\nand three small Caribbean island countries, Aruba, \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 43/46\r\nCuracao and Sint Maarten, that is an issue of particular \r\nconcern to us.\r\nFortunately, the grim tableau that I sketched a \r\nmoment ago is not the whole picture. There has been \r\ngenuine and significant progress. In the past 20 years, \r\nthe percentage of people living in extreme poverty \r\nhas been halved. That was one of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, which we achieved well before the \r\n2015 deadline. I remember that many of us in this Hall \r\nbelieved that that would not be possible. Well, that Goal \r\nwas reached. \r\nSometimes lightning does strike twice. The \r\ninternational community has reached agreement on \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals for 2030. Another \r\nmajor achievement and a victory for diplomacy in \r\na time of so much strife is the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. With the recent ratifications by China \r\nand the United States, there is a real prospect that it will \r\nenter into force, hopefully before Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon leaves office at the end of this year. That \r\nis in large part his legacy, and we commend Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon for it.\r\nAnd, yes, there have also been positive developments \r\nin the area of security. New and important work has \r\nbeen undertaken to stop foreign terrorist fighters \r\nfrom travelling to conflict zones, to halt the financing \r\nof terrorism, to impose sanctions on ISIS, and to \r\nwork in communities on deradicalization and local \r\nsupport, putting together hard and soft security. The \r\nNetherlands, together with Morocco, is trying to do \r\nits part as co-Chair of the Global Counterterrorism \r\nForum. Preventing violent extremism is now also high \r\non our United Nations agenda, thanks to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s plan of action.\r\nAnd, yes, peacekeeping has evolved and has been \r\ntransformed from traditional ceasefire monitoring \r\nmissions into very complex missions with integrated \r\nmandates. More attention is being paid to the entire \r\nspectrum of peacekeeping, from early warning and \r\nprevention to peacebuilding in the fragile post-conflict \r\nperiod. And more consideration is being given to the \r\nprotection of civilians — the goal of peacekeeping \r\nmissions — including the tackling of gender and sexual \r\nabuse and the important task of establishing the rule \r\nof law.\r\nThat is not just theory or statistics. Ask the 12,000 \r\npeople who sought refuge at the United Nations \r\ncompound in Bor, South Sudan. Head of Mission Ken \r\nPayumo had the courage to let them in and protect \r\nthem. Ask the women of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, where, thanks to the gender unit in the \r\nUnited Nations Organization Stabilization Mission, \r\nsexual violence has decreased substantially since 2013. \r\nAsk the people of Nepal, where, in 2006, the United \r\nNations helped the Seven-Party Alliance to sustain the \r\npeaceful solution to the conflict.\r\nAllow me to briefly go back to the previous term \r\nof the Netherlands on the Security Council. Our \r\nfirst meeting was on Sunday, 2 January 1999, when \r\nthe Council convened an emergency meeting in the \r\nafternoon. A United Nations-chartered plane had just \r\nbeen shot down in war-ravaged Angola. United Nations \r\npersonnel were being held hostage by the National Union \r\nfor the Total Independence of Angola. Two decades \r\nlater, Angola has seen substantial improvements; it is \r\ncurrently a non-permanent member of the Council. Or \r\ntake Sierra Leone, another country that was frequently \r\non the Council’s agenda that year. The international \r\ncommunity helped to broker a peace agreement and \r\nput in place a large peacekeeping operation. In 2004, a \r\nUnited Nations-backed war crimes court, located in the \r\nNetherlands, began trying senior leaders on both sides \r\nof the conflict. Sierra Leone now has a democratically \r\nelected President and, with international support, is \r\nemerging from the recent Ebola crisis.\r\nIn all these cases, we can see the results of hard \r\nwork, sustained effort and prolonged investment by the \r\ninternational community. Those are results that should \r\nmake us proud and hopeful. But such successes soon \r\nfade from the public mind when they are replaced by \r\nimages of children suffering the trauma of wars for \r\nwhich they are not responsible. We cannot deny that \r\nthere have been peace and security failures. The list \r\nhas the power to shock: Rwanda, Srebrenica. Now it \r\nincludes Yemen and, of course, Syria, with Aleppo as a \r\nterrifying symbol.\r\nThe number-one priority now is to restore the \r\ncessation of hostilities and ensure humanitarian \r\naccess. I call upon the parties most closely involved to \r\ndo everything in their power to make that happen as \r\nsoon as possible. And I call upon them, as I have done \r\nbefore, to ensure proper and transparent monitoring \r\nof any such cessation of hostilities. If non-compliance \r\nbecomes the norm, how can we expect Syrians to trust \r\nthe international community and to put their faith in the \r\nUnited Nations system?\r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n44/46 16-29553\r\nIn resolution 2254 (2015), the Security Council \r\nunanimously expressed its support for a nationwide \r\nceasefire in Syria. If violence continues to be the \r\nnorm, I urge the Council not to remain silent. Like my \r\nFrench colleague, I wish to ensure better monitoring \r\nand follow-up when a ceasefire is breached. At the \r\nInternational Syria Support Group, which will meet \r\nthis afternoon, we will call for more qualitative and \r\ntransparent monitoring and for the systematic violations \r\nof ceasefires to be dealt with by the Security Council.\r\nAt the same time, let us not forget the primacy of \r\npolitics. While we work frantically to relieve the tragic \r\nhumanitarian situation, work on a political transition \r\nplan for Syria should go ahead, since only a political \r\nsolution can end the horrific tragedy. We wholeheartedly \r\nsupport the outstanding efforts by the Special Envoy of \r\nthe Secretary-General, Staffan de Mistura, and others \r\nto that end.\r\nWhat is the value of the United Nations and where \r\nis its credibility if we talk about the responsibility \r\nto protect but are not capable of resolving the Syrian \r\nconflict or ready to answer the call by the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights for an independent \r\ninternational investigation into serious human rights \r\nviolations in Yemen?\r\nIn conclusion, what we do matters greatly. That \r\nis why I have stressed the need for an era of genuine \r\nimplementation under the guidance of an “Implementer-\r\nGeneral”. But how we talk about the United Nations \r\nalso matters. By that I mean we must tell the real story, \r\nthe whole story. We should not simply paint the usual \r\ngloomy picture of a powerless United Nations. We need \r\nto counter the entrenched view that the Organization \r\nis simply a burden to be borne and a scapegoat for \r\nour failures. The United Nations can be greater than \r\nthe sum of its parts only if we allow it to be. And we \r\nmust — there is too much at stake.\r\nFinally, let me return to the question that I was \r\nasked: do I still believe in the United Nations? My \r\nanswer was yes, but only if we show the determination \r\nand resolve of which the Charter speaks. The agenda \r\nis clear. The goals have been set. Now is the time to \r\nimplement and deliver.\r\nThe Kingdom of the Netherlands will continue to \r\ndo its part and will remain a steadfast supporter of the \r\nUnited Nations and its institutions, as it has been since \r\nthe Organization’s inception. It is with that in mind that \r\nwe are cooperating closely with Italy to prepare for \r\nmembership of the Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non His Excellency Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Secretary of \r\nState of the Holy See.\r\nCardinal Parolin (Holy See): Last year, in his \r\naddress in this Hall, His Holiness Pope Francis defined \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as “an \r\nimportant sign of hope” (A/70/PV.3, p. 4). Just a few \r\ndays ago, he reiterated his appreciation for the actions \r\ntaken last year by the United Nations, encouraging all \r\nto put those ambitious objectives into practice. and \r\nsaying that \r\n“[t]he protection of our common home requires a \r\ngrowing global political consensus. Along these \r\nlines, I am gratified that, in September 2015, \r\nthe nations of the world adopted the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and that, in December 2015, \r\nthey approved the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, which sets the demanding yet fundamental \r\ngoal of halting the rising of the global temperature. \r\nNow Governments are obliged to honour the \r\ncommitments they made, while businesses must \r\nalso responsibly do their part. It is up to citizens to \r\ninsist that this happen and indeed to advocate for \r\neven more ambitious goals.”\r\nThe achievement of the 2030 Agenda involves an \r\nimportant assumption of responsibility on the part of \r\nGovernments and the commitment of all, for the common \r\ngood. This commitment entails recognizing the need \r\nto strive not only for great macroeconomic goals but \r\nfor outcomes that are specific, lasting and equitably \r\ndistributed. Without a stable financial situation, lasting \r\ninvestments and a commercial appraisal that favours \r\ninternal growth, however, the 2030 Agenda will be \r\nimpossible to achieve. Pope Francis has emphasized \r\nthat \r\n“[e]conomics and politics and society and culture \r\ncannot be dominated by thinking only of the short-\r\nterm and immediate financial or electoral gains. \r\nInstead, they urgently need to be redirected to \r\nthe common good, which includes sustainability \r\nand care for creation. One concrete case is the \r\n‘ecological debt’ between the global north and \r\nsouth. Repaying it would require treating the \r\nenvironments of poorer nations with care and \r\nproviding the financial resources and technical \r\n22/09/2016 A/71/PV.14\r\n16-29553 45/46\r\nassistance needed to help them deal with climate \r\nchange and promote sustainable development.”\r\nWe always must remember that \r\ndevelopment — especially integral human \r\ndevelopment — cannot be imposed. Men and women, \r\nas individuals, must be the principal agents of the 2030 \r\nAgenda. Last year, in this very Hall, Pope Francis \r\naffirmed that\r\n“[t]his presupposes and requires the right to \r\neducation ... which is ensured first and foremost by \r\nrespecting and reinforcing the primary right of the \r\nfamily to educate its children, as well as the right \r\nof churches and social groups to support and assist \r\nfamilies in the education of their boys and girls.\r\n“[f]or all this, the simplest and best measure and \r\nindicator of the implementation of the new agenda \r\nfor development will be effective, practical and \r\nimmediate access, on the part of all, to essential \r\nmaterial and spiritual goods: housing, dignified \r\nand properly remunerated employment, adequate \r\nfood and drinking water, religious freedom and, \r\nmore generally, spiritual freedom and education” \r\n(supra, p. 4).\r\nSuch a process of bringing about integral human \r\ndevelopment — a concept that includes but is not \r\nexhausted by economic development — should, \r\nthrough multilateral initiatives, stimulate also the quest \r\nfor complementary, alternative finance systems capable \r\nof ensuring that financial resources are both accessible \r\nto and sustainable for the poorest.\r\nAs Pope Francis said here last year,\r\n“[the] pillars of integral human development have \r\na common foundation, which is the right to life,” \r\n(ibid., p. 4) \r\nand we are required to \r\n“recognize a moral law written into human nature \r\nitself, which includes the natural difference \r\nbetween man and woman and an absolute respect \r\nfor life in all its stages and dimensions” (ibid., p. 5).\r\nMoreover, integral human development is \r\nimpossible without peace. Only two days ago in \r\nAssisi, Pope Francis, together with numerous other \r\nworld religious leaders, stressed the importance of \r\ndialogue as a privileged way to becoming peacemakers. \r\nConflicts not only render the attainment of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals at the regional level \r\nabsolutely impossible, but also destroy so many human \r\nresources, means of production and cultural heritage. \r\nToday, as during the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s, there is \r\nthe recurrence of the threat of nuclear conflict with its \r\nterrible consequences.\r\nThe enormous and ill-fated effect of war is \r\na downward spiral from which there is often no \r\nescape. It triggers increased political polarization at \r\nthe global level and narrows the spaces in which the \r\nsame international community can propose effective \r\nsolutions for a stable and lasting peace.\r\nAmong the factors that degrade social coexistence \r\nin countries and undermine the whole international \r\ncommunity we must count the scourge of terrorism. \r\nIn the course of recent years we have seen terrorism \r\nmetastasize to so many parts of the world. Neighbours \r\nof Syria and Iraq have increasingly become the victims \r\nof innumerable barbaric acts. Beyond the Middle East, \r\natrocious acts of terrorism have introduced fear into the \r\ndaily lives of so many across the globe.\r\nIn the Middle East we see the terrible consequences \r\nof the spiral of war: many lives destroyed, failed States, \r\ncollapsed ceasefires, unsuccessful peace initiatives \r\nand failed attempts to resolve the fundamental causes \r\nof conflict in Syria, Iraq and Libya, find a solution \r\nto the presidency crisis in Lebanon, or resolve the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict. That persistent failure has \r\ndampened the hopes and promises of all who consider \r\nthe region sacred and holy.\r\nWe can also witness those failures in the long-\r\nstanding conflicts that continue to oppress and take the \r\nlives of so many in South Sudan, the Great Lakes and \r\nfor two and half years now in eastern Ukraine. Although \r\nthose situations have all been high-profile and have led \r\nto an immense amount of human suffering, we remain \r\nvery far from resolving the root causes. It almost seems \r\nthat we have accepted conflict, war and terrorism as a \r\npart of normal life.\r\nBeyond the urgency of the need for ceasefires, \r\nrespect for the dignity and the rights of affected peoples \r\nand access to humanitarian aid, it is also necessary to \r\nfacilitate negotiation among those with direct or indirect \r\nresponsibility for particular conflicts. Thankful for the \r\npositive outcome in Colombia, the heartfelt hope of \r\nthe Holy See is that, through facilitation efforts on the \r\npart of the international community, various forms of \r\ncontact and dialogue will be pursued to resolve ongoing \r\nconflicts.\r\nA/71/PV.14 22/09/2016\r\n46/46 16-29553\r\nIn particular, from the beginning of the conflict \r\nin Syria, the Holy See has invited all of the parties to \r\ndialogue and the international community to spare no \r\neffort in facilitating an end to violence and in promoting \r\nconditions conducive to a dialogue aimed at finding a \r\npolitical solution. Syria, however, has been overrun by \r\nall kinds of armed groups. The uproar of arms must \r\ncease so that peace may stand a chance and, above \r\nall, so that humanitarian assistance may be brought to \r\nthose most in need. The Holy See is convinced that this \r\nis possible, provided that there is the political will to \r\nbring an end to the fighting.\r\nDespite the present difficulties, one can still \r\ngratefully find in Lebanon the conviction that common \r\ngood requires the participation and cooperation of all \r\nsectors of society, based on the rule of law and the \r\nidea that institutions are founded on respect for the \r\ninnate dignity of every human being. The Lebanese \r\nconstitutional arrangement, in which diverse ethnic \r\ngroups, cultures and religions are an asset and contribute \r\nto a peaceful coexistence, can also be a model for a \r\npolitical solution in the region.\r\nThe Holy See also believes that in the Middle East \r\na renewed commitment in favour of the rule of law and \r\nthe freedom of religion and of conscience is the most \r\neffective way to safeguard the dignity of all. In that \r\ncontext, the 2015 global agreement signed by the Holy \r\nSee and Palestine, which was subsequently ratified by \r\nboth parties, sets out in law defence of the most basic \r\nhuman rights, among which are freedom of religion, the \r\nright to peaceful assembly and the freedom to publicly \r\nprofess one’s religious beliefs. In the complex situation \r\nof the Middle East, in particular in Iraq and Syria, the \r\nHoly See maintains that the global agreement with \r\nPalestine can serve as a template for other countries \r\nwith analogous social structures.\r\nIn the context of the renewed efforts to relaunch \r\nthe peace process between Israelis and Palestinians, the \r\nHoly See renews its appeal to both parties to abstain \r\nfrom any unilateral or illegal measures whatsoever, \r\nwhich may constitute an obstacle to the search for \r\npeace and advancing the two-State solution.\r\nWhen we look at the phenomenon of forced \r\nmigration, we find ourselves before a population of \r\npeople on the move greater than that of many of the \r\nStates represented here: 65 million people have been \r\ncompelled to f lee from their homes and communities \r\nbecause of persecution, conflict, widespread violence \r\nand hunger, and devastated lands. A word of praise \r\nmust go to Lebanon and to Jordan for the hospitality \r\nthey are offering to all who have escaped from war \r\nand destruction in Iraq and Syria, as well as to Turkey, \r\nwhich is hosting millions of Syrian refugees.\r\nBeyond the necessary urgent consideration of how \r\nto resolve the causes of that forced exodus, we must \r\nnote that migration and development are tightly linked. \r\nThe consequences of the mass movement of refugees \r\nand migrants threaten to weaken our commitment \r\nto the values of solidarity and hospitality towards \r\nthose in need. Those values stand at the heart of the \r\nExtraordinary Jubilee of Mercy to which Pope Francis \r\nhas been summoning the world. As Pope Francis has \r\nemphasized, \r\n“[m]ercy is the fundamental law that dwells in the \r\nheart of every person who looks sincerely into the \r\neyes of his brothers and sisters on the path of life”, \r\nespecially those who are the weakest and most \r\nvulnerable. Drawing special attention to those who are \r\nin prison, the Pope has renewed his pressing appeal \r\n“to the consciences of leaders, that they come to \r\nan international consensus aimed at abolishing the \r\ndeath penalty”.\r\nWithout authentic and absolute respect for life, there \r\ncan be no development that is truly human, integral and \r\nsustainable. Precisely to foster that development, Pope \r\nFrancis has instituted a new dicastery, or department, \r\nof the Holy See, the purpose of which is to promote \r\njustice, peace, the safeguarding of the environment and \r\ncare of those most in need. The poor and needy are the \r\nhuman face of sustainable development that we wish to \r\nkeep ever before us, so that we may become responsible \r\nagents of a more just and truly human society.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.50 p.m. \r\n"
