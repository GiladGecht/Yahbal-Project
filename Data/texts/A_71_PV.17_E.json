(Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Balé (Congo), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Bujar Nishani, President of the \r\nRepublic of Albania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Albania.\r\nMr. Bujar Nishani, President of the Republic \r\nof Albania, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Bujar Nishani, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Albania, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Nishani: It is a special pleasure for \r\nme, in my capacity of Head of State of the Republic \r\nof Albania, to address the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session.\r\nAt the outset, I wish to greet, and hail the election \r\nof, the President of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, and to wish him good luck and every \r\nsuccess in fulfilling the agenda and the ambitious \r\ncommitments undertaken.\r\nAbove and beyond the honour and privilege \r\nof addressing the Assembly, I also feel a specific \r\nresponsibility to provide a modest contribution, \r\nespecially during this important time of regional and \r\nglobal developments, when our attention has been \r\nfocused on ensuring sustainable development.\r\nI would like to express deep appreciation for the \r\nsubstantial vision and role of the Secretary-General and \r\nhis contribution at the helm of the United Nations by \r\ndrawing our attention to fundamental issues associated \r\nwith values and human dignity and to issues related to \r\npeace and security on our common planet.\r\nThis year Albania celebrated the sixty-first \r\nanniversary of its membership in the United Nations, \r\nand it is with legitimate pleasure that I emphasize \r\nthat my country remains faithful to the principles \r\nof the United Nations Charter and makes a maximal \r\ncontribution, using all of its potential and capacities, to \r\nensure peace and safety and to improve human rights.\r\nI take this opportunity to assure the Assembly \r\nthat my country has the necessary sensitivity to the \r\nchallenges facing the world today and that it supports \r\nall common efforts to address them, with an unwavering \r\nconviction that conflict prevention and ensuring global \r\npeace and security, with a focus on the attention paid to \r\npeople and to human society, require close cooperation \r\nand coordination.\r\nIn addressing these challenges, Albania is \r\ninclusively and comprehensively engaged in crisis \r\nprevention. Its engagement is focused on humanitarian \r\naid; its contribution to regional stability and security; \r\nsustainable development; ratification of the Paris \r\nAgreement and the depositing of the instruments \r\nof ratification with the Secretary-General; the \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

I take this opportunity \r\nto announce that Albania is determined to be active \r\nat the third United Nations Conference on Housing \r\nand Sustainable Urban Development, which offers a \r\nunique opportunity for the adoption of a new urban \r\nglobal agenda to strengthen relationships and synergies \r\namong urbanization and sustainable development and \r\nclimate change.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement are \r\nrightly considered to be opportunities to create a \r\nbetter life for present and future generations. The \r\nimplementation of these two international documents, in \r\nthe context of which Albania is working proactively, is \r\nrightly considered a key global strategy for coping with \r\nclimate change, achieving sustainable development and \r\naddressing international assistance and peacemaking \r\nand peacebuilding issues.\r\nAlbania was among those countries that quickly \r\nratified the Paris Agreement, with the sole aim of \r\ncontributing to the acceleration of its entry into effect \r\nand becoming active as soon as possible.\r\nIn May, I welcomed and attended the first Global \r\nHumanitarian Summit, organized and held under the \r\nauspices of the Secretary-General in Istanbul. I would \r\nnote in particular Albania’s support for the Agenda \r\nfor Humanity and the view that a shift from perpetual \r\ncrisis management to effective management in the area \r\nof prevention and early action is urgently needed. I am \r\nconvinced that this Agenda will help us to translate the \r\ninitiative into action for the good of humankind and \r\ngenerations to come.\r\nAlbania is joining in the international community’s \r\nefforts to deal with migration and refugee f lows in a \r\nconsistent and coordinated manner. Today, realities \r\non the ground and at the policy level are leading, even \r\nforcing, us to change our approach at the regional level \r\nand beyond, in order to take qualitative steps forward \r\nin our work, approach and cooperation on migration.\r\nAlbania, as a European Union candidate country and \r\nin anticipation of the opening of accession negotiations, \r\nhas embraced all of the positions and commitments of \r\nthe European Union whenever required and necessary. \r\nEven within the framework of the Agenda for Humanity, \r\nAlbania has joined the European Union positions and \r\nwill contribute with all of its potential and capabilities \r\nto meeting those commitments.\r\nI take this opportunity to compliment once again \r\nthe Secretary-General on the report published earlier \r\nthis year entitled “One humanity: shared responsibility” \r\n(A/70/709), as well as to reaffirm the support of my \r\ncountry for the basic principles set out in that report. It \r\noffers us a complete picture of the sad reality of human \r\nsociety, the humanitarian situation and human rights \r\naround the world.\r\nAnother fundamental challenge to the common \r\nvalues of human society is the fight against international \r\nterrorism and violent extremism. A few days ago, \r\nthe citizens of New York, the city in which we have \r\ngathered today, and all other American citizens felt the \r\npain and grief of commemorating the victims of the \r\nterrorist attacks that took place 15 years ago.\r\nTerrorist attacks, especially those with religious \r\nmotivations, have intensified in recent years, striking \r\nwith ferocity and savagery at the major cities of France, \r\nBelgium, Turkey, Kuwait, Egypt, Tunisia, Lebanon \r\nand many other countries across the world, aiming to \r\nintimidate our societies and bring them to their knees.\r\nIn this context, Albania appreciates the pivotal role \r\nplayed by the United Nations in the global fight against \r\nterrorism and the prevention of violent extremism, as \r\nwe consider the Organization as a key actor. Albania \r\nalso supports the Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to \r\nPrevent Violent Extremism (A/70/674) and the active \r\nrole of the United Nations in finding political solutions \r\nand addressing the root causes of conflict in areas \r\nso affected.\r\nAlbania reaffirms its support for Security Council \r\nresolutions 2170 (2014), 2178 (2014) and 2253 (2015), \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 3/58\r\nwhich require States to take the measures necessary \r\nto ensure respect for and the upholding of human \r\nrights, as well as address the issue of so-called foreign \r\nfighters and the financing of international terrorism. At \r\npresent, Albania is enlisted in and, like other proactive \r\ncountries, is committed to fully implementing \r\nthe Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy. Given our \r\nexperience of many centuries of peaceful, harmonious \r\nreligious coexistence, as well as the need to address this \r\nchallenge domestically, Albania is implementing a pilot \r\nprogramme for preventing and countering terrorism \r\nand violent extremism through education, with the \r\nambition of turning that programme into a platform of \r\ndimensions wider than a purely domestic one. Albania \r\nis ready to share its experience with other countries \r\nand peoples.\r\nGiven the policies that it has pursued over the past \r\ntwo decades, Albania has become increasingly active in \r\ncontributing to security issues in the international arena. \r\nMy country has ensured its role and is strengthening \r\nthat role through its proactive membership in the North \r\nAtlantic Treaty Organization, its clear support for and \r\nconcrete commitment to the implementation of the \r\nCommon Security and Defence Policy mechanisms of \r\nthe European Union, and its support for and participation \r\nin United Nations operations and in the policy advisory \r\nassistance missions carried out in Afghanistan and \r\nSudan. Furthermore, Albania has strengthened its role \r\nthrough participating in missions of the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe, improving \r\nits strategic partnership with the United States and \r\nthe European Union and engaging seriously in the \r\nfight against terrorism and combating threats to peace \r\nand security in the world. Since September 1996, \r\nAlbania has contributed 6,528 troops to international \r\npeacekeeping operations. \r\nAlbania believes that the peace process in the \r\nMiddle East can be maintained through negotiations \r\nand that the parties involved should take advantage of \r\nthe energy and attention provided by the international \r\ncommunity actors towards a final and lasting solution \r\nof this issue.\r\nAlbania also confirms its support for the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations to facilitate a peace process in Syria, \r\nand it hailed the engagements aimed at establishing \r\npeace in Syria, opening and securing the humanitarian \r\naid and assistance routes, and fighting Da’esh and \r\nAl-Nusra with determination. But the developments \r\nthat have unfolded in recent days and hours are \r\nvery worrying. The attacks on and interruption of \r\nhumanitarian aid convoys to the civilian population \r\nundermine the efforts to reach an armistice and put an \r\nend to the violence.\r\nAlbania has recently followed with concern the \r\nnuclear tests carried out in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and has condemned them as open, \r\nsystematic and provocative acts in violation of the \r\nresolutions of the Security Council of the United \r\nNations. Those acts affect peace and security in North-\r\nEast Asia, as well as worldwide, and Albania therefore \r\ndemands that that country comply with and enforce \r\ninternational law and the United Nations resolutions.\r\nAlbania devotes special attention to regional \r\ncooperation in its entirety. Our foreign policy is \r\nmaximally oriented towards the strengthening of \r\ngood-neighbourly relations with all of the countries \r\nof the region and their full-f ledged integration into \r\nEuro-Atlantic processes. The energetic engagement of \r\nAlbania in that context and its active and constructive \r\nrole in all regional initiatives have helped to strengthen \r\npolitical, economic and human development among \r\nall partner countries in the region, with the goal \r\nof establishing an integration agenda among those \r\ncountries, the European Union and the Western Balkan \r\ncountries as part of a common journey of regional \r\ncountries towards European Union membership.\r\nAlbania supports Kosovo’s participation in all \r\nmultilateral, regional and international activities, based \r\non the fundamental principle that all countries in the \r\nregion should actively participate in and contribute \r\nto the process of regional cooperation. Kosovo has \r\nmade extraordinary achievements in consolidating \r\nits democratic institutions, good governance, \r\nthe multi-ethnic coexistence of religions and, in \r\nparticular, progress in the Euro-Atlantic processes. \r\nThe independence of Kosovo has served to strengthen \r\npeace, stability and security and has inspired \r\nreconciliation in the region. In that spirit, we support \r\nand encourage — with no hesitation — progress in the \r\nongoing dialogue between Kosovo and Serbia, which is \r\nbeing mediated and facilitated by the European Union \r\nand supported by the United States. We consider those \r\ntalks to be a very suitable platform for ironing out all of \r\nthe outstanding issues so that they can set their sights \r\ntowards the future.\r\nAlbania will continue to strongly support the \r\nexpansion of the international recognition of Kosovo \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n4/58 16-29667\r\nand of the active role that it can play as a fully f ledged \r\nmember in all regional organizations, just as we support \r\nthe inexorable process of its membership in international \r\norganizations. That process supports inclusive \r\ninternational policies and Kosovo’s contribution to \r\nglobal policies, and also strengthens peace, security \r\nand development in the Balkan region. Today, Kosovo \r\nis recognized by 109 United Nations Member States, \r\nand I am convinced that soon other Members of the \r\nOrganization will recognize it, contributing to the \r\nfurther strengthening of peace and stability in the \r\nregion of South-East Europe and beyond.\r\nAlbania is fully committed to the process of \r\nEuropean integration, and we consider the prospect \r\nof European Union membership as an indispensable \r\nstimulus for far-reaching reforms in the interest of \r\nstrengthening the rule of law and achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment in my country. The European Union is \r\nfacing severe challenges, especially after Brexit, but \r\nAlbania is determined to pursue the path of reforms, \r\nconsidering European integration its major objective \r\nand its best — and only — alternative.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to confirm once again \r\nthe determination of Albania to continue its support \r\nfor the United Nations agenda, particularly the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which seeks to \r\nensure sustainable development in all countries, We \r\nalso support efforts to further strengthen and enhance \r\nthe role of the Organization on the global level.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Albania for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Bujar Nishani, President of the Republic \r\nof Albania, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Alpha Condé, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guinea\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea.\r\nMr. Alpha Condé, President of the Republic \r\nof Guinea, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Alpha Condé, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Condé (spoke in French): My delegation \r\nwould like to begin by congratulating Mr. Thomson on \r\nhis well-deserved election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at this session, and I would like to assure the \r\nPresident that he will haveour complete support for a \r\nsuccessful session. It is also my pleasure to pay a well-\r\ndeserved tribute to the previous President, Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, for the transparent and dynamic approach \r\nwith which he led the activities of the General Assembly \r\nduring its seventieth session.\r\nOn 25 September 2015, in this Hall, the leaders \r\nof the world put together their vision for the world for \r\nthe period up to 2030 by adopting the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and its 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. At the heart of that Agenda lies \r\nan ambition for the international community to work \r\ntirelessly to eradicate poverty in all its forms and \r\ndimensions so to create inclusive, fair and prosperous \r\nsocieties that are respectful of the environment and \r\nhuman rights. Such an ambition clearly initiates a shift \r\nin the paradigm for development, which is rendered \r\nnecessary not only by the multiple challenges that \r\nface humankind, but also by irreversible relationships \r\nof interdependence.\r\nA review of the world in which we live today does \r\nnot inspire great optimism. The gap between the rich \r\nand the poor continues to grow. The number of massive \r\npopulation displacements is also on the rise. Various \r\ncrises and conflicts emerge and sometimes persist, \r\nmaking our planet ever more vulnerable to climate \r\nchange. Such developments are alarming, and they \r\nrequire a global, integrated, cohesive and concerted \r\napproach that links words to actions tot launch a \r\ncollective effort consisting of vigorous and sustained \r\nactions aimed at achieving the sustainable prosperity of \r\nhumankind. In that regard, we would like to welcome \r\nthe President’s choice of a theme for this session: \r\n“Sustainable Development Goals: a new impetus to \r\ntransform our world”. That theme will, we hope, lead to \r\nthe creation of the necessary foundations on which we \r\ncan move towards those goals.\r\nThe scarcity of financial resources available for \r\ndevelopment is cause for the reappraisal of official \r\ndevelopment assistance so as to make it more effective, \r\nparticularly for the most vulnerable countries. Such \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 5/58\r\ndevelopment assistance will help to make those \r\ncountries more resistant to economic, social and \r\nenvironmental shocks, both inside and outside their \r\nborders. In that framework, Africa is the continent \r\nwith the youngest population in the world and the \r\nmost vulnerable countries, which should be especially \r\nborne in mind as we implement the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nTo reduce its vulnerability and build up its \r\nresistance to shocks, Africa will need deep structural \r\ntransformation in order to develop a dynamic private \r\nsector — an engine for development. The development \r\nand implementation of public policies should fully \r\ninvolve the creation of employment and economic \r\nopportunities for the most vulnerable parts of the \r\npopulation, specifically women and young people, so \r\nas to include them effectively in socioeconomic life \r\nand enable them to develop their potential. Substantial \r\ninvestment in making women and young people more \r\nindependent is needed, particularly because the scourges \r\nof terrorism, extremism and intolerance, as well as \r\ntrafficking in illicit arms and drugs, all accentuate the \r\nmisery and weakness of the most vulnerable parts of \r\nthe population.\r\nPartnerships and innovative financing schemes \r\nare needed to accelerate dynamic growth in Africa. \r\nNew technologies must, therefore, serve the interest of \r\nsustainable development. \r\nChanging the economic model on the African \r\ncontinent is impossible without sustainable access \r\nto energy. That is a challenge for Africa. Today, \r\nseven out of ten Africans — a total of 700 million \r\nAfricans — do not have access to electricity. That is \r\nwhy the Heads of State and Government of the African \r\nUnion countries decided to work with the support of the \r\ninternational community on a robust plan to accelerate \r\nthe electrification of the continent through renewable \r\nenergies, so that we can move from 25 to 80 per \r\ncent access to energy in 10 years. A fund devoted to \r\nfinancing renewable energy in Africa has been put \r\nin place to collect contributions for Africa within the \r\nframework of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nAs a spokesman for Africa on renewable energies, \r\nI would like to call on the international community, \r\nparticularly financial institutions, to work with \r\nour continent in implementing those objectives so \r\nthat we can build a strong African continent that is \r\nrespectful of commitments to the environment and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nDevelopment can be sustainable only with peace and \r\nstability. Peace and stability cannot be ensured without \r\ndevelopment. We therefore need to state that peace, \r\nan essential asset for the harmonious development of \r\nhumankind, continues to face great challenges. \r\nTerrorism has struck around the world, threatening \r\npeace and international stability. We firmly condemn \r\nthe barbarous acts that have struck Mali, Burkina Faso, \r\nCôte d’Ivoire, France, Turkey and Pakistan, to name \r\njust a few. We reiterate our deep sympathy for and \r\nsolidarity with all countries affected by such instances \r\nof obscurantism. We are convinced that, although one \r\nmight try to defeat terrorism using military means \r\nalone, it cannot be prevented or contained except \r\nby significant socioeconomic investments aimed at \r\nreducing radicalization.\r\nIn the Middle East, terror and mindless violence \r\nhave led to desolation in Syria and Yemen, while the \r\ninternational community has still not managed to reach \r\na sustainable resolution to the conflicts in the region. \r\nOur collective passivity regarding the impasse in the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian peace process also dangerously \r\nreduces the possibilities for a successful resolution \r\nto the conflict. Guinea has always unambiguously \r\nexpressed its unconditional solidarity with the just \r\nPalestinian cause, and we are convinced that the solution \r\nneeded in the Middle East must be based on two States \r\nliving peacefully, side by side, within internationally \r\nrecognized borders. \r\nRegarding the embargo that has for a long time \r\naff licted Cuba, we encourage all efforts to normalize \r\nrelations between that country and the United States.\r\nOn the African continent, new and old crises — often \r\nfratricidal — continue to undermine stability. We \r\nwelcome the support extended by this Organization to \r\nbuild peace in Africa, specifically in Central Africa \r\nand Mali. Guinea has actively contributed to the efforts \r\nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in Mali through the deployment \r\nof a battalion of 850 men in Kidal. However, it has paid \r\nthe heavy price of losing nine soldiers to violent attacks \r\ncommitted by terrorist groups that are threatening \r\nthe stability of the region. That is why we ask, while \r\nmaintaining respect for the sovereignty of States \r\nand the peacekeeping mandates, for the adoption of \r\na legal framework that endows the United Nations \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n6/58 16-29667\r\nwith stronger power regarding counter-terrorism. \r\nThat will enable international forces to improve their \r\nintelligence capacities in order to better defend and \r\nfight back against terrorist attacks. With that in mind, \r\nthe President of Liberia and I recently carried out a \r\nmission in Guinea-Bissau. In that regard, a preventive, \r\ncoordinated, concerted and coherent approach on a \r\ndaily basis seems required so as to be able to grasp the \r\nprofound causes of such crises and the factors that help \r\nperpetuate them.\r\nWe welcome the adoption on 27 April of the almost \r\nidentical resolutions — General Assembly resolution \r\n70/262 and Security Council resolution 2282 (2016) —\r\non the United Nations peacebuilding architecture, with \r\nparticular emphasis on prevention and the integration of \r\nwomen and young people in all sectors of activity in our \r\nsocieties. Guinea — which, at its request, was inscribed \r\non the agenda of the Peacebuilding Commission in \r\n2011 — believes that such a framework offers us the \r\nopportunity to evaluate the nature and scope of our \r\ncollaboration with the Commission in order to keep it \r\nin line with our needs.\r\nIf I may, I will share with the Assembly some \r\naspects of the current situation of Guinea. After two \r\nstressful years, Guinea became free of the transmission \r\nof the Ebola virus as of 29 December 2015. The fight \r\nagainst Ebola was difficult and arduous, but our efforts, \r\nsupported by the international community, have put an \r\nend to that terrible disease. I would like to pay tribute \r\nto the solidarity shown by other countries affected by \r\nthe epidemic. The victory against Ebola belongs to \r\neveryone and is something that we should all celebrate. \r\nHowever, the road before us is long, because the \r\nepidemic has greatly undermined all economic activity \r\nin our country. The most vulnerable people, particularly \r\nwomen and children, have been made even more \r\nvulnerable, and our challenges lie in the need to ensure \r\ntheir social reinsertion. The virulence of the disease \r\nhas identified the weaknesses of our health-care system \r\nand the sectors that need special attention in order to \r\nensure the resilience of our people and our continent.\r\nTherefore, in the context of the post-Ebola \r\nrecovery, Guinea has developed its strategy, which was \r\npresented here, along with those of Liberia and Sierra \r\nLeone, at the International Ebola Recovery Conference \r\norganized by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. We \r\nwish to express our gratitude to our partners who have \r\nfulfilled the pledges that they made at the Conference, \r\nand invite others that have not yet done so to make \r\ntheir promises a reality, so that Guinea, Liberia and \r\nSierra Leone will be are able to reconnect quickly with \r\nsustainable development.\r\nDespite the Ebola epidemic, the people of Guinea \r\nhave demonstrated remarkable resilience and solidarity. \r\nThat has allowed us to pursue many reforms aimed \r\nat strengthening the rule of law and at developing a \r\nframework conducive to investment and governance \r\nthat inclludes all components of society. On the \r\nmacroeconomic front, after a long period of fiscal \r\nrestraint, the country has just concluded its eighth and \r\nfinal review with the International Monetary Fund.\r\nThe United Nations remains the only viable \r\nalternative for the promotion and emergence of \r\nprosperous and inclusive societies that respect human \r\nrights and the environment. Nevertheless,we cannot \r\ndeny that our Organization must constantly reform \r\nits bodies and its working methods so as to be able to \r\naddress threats to peace and security and the challenges \r\nof underdevelopment and to assist in the effective \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nI wish to conclude by paying tribute and expressing \r\nour sincere gratitude to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his leadership and immense contribution \r\nto the world that we are all aspiring to build. We thank \r\nhim for his tireless efforts and dedication, particularly \r\nwith regard to the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. Those agreements will certainly form \r\na significant part of the legacy of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon to the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Guinea for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Alpha Condé, President of the Republic \r\nof Guinea, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of \r\nthe Republic of the Niger\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of the Niger.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 7/58\r\nMr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Niger, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mahamadou \r\nIssoufou, President of the Republic of the Niger, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Issoufou (spoke in French): It is now \r\n71 years since our Organization, the United Nations, \r\nwas created to ensure peace, security, cooperation, \r\neconomic development and respect for human rights \r\nworldwide. During those 71 years, our Organization \r\nhas been successful in those areas. That success would \r\nhave been impossible without the work and unwavering \r\ndedication shown by the tens of thousands of women \r\nand men employed today by the United Nation. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to honour them.\r\nI also pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho has led our Organization with courage and wisdom \r\nthroughout the past decade. I congratulate him on his \r\nwork, particularly regarding the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, where his commitment proved \r\ninstrumental, and also for his role in the adoption of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Finally, \r\nI would like to express once again our gratitude for his \r\ncommitment to Africa, and to the Niger in particular.\r\nWe could always count on his support during the \r\nmultifaceted crises that our country has experienced in \r\nrecent years.\r\nIn September last year, we adopted the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, which aims to eradicate \r\npoverty by that year and leave no one behind in the \r\nprocess. At the heart of that project is our commitment \r\nto place mankind at the centre of development and meet \r\nthe requirements and limitations of our planet Earth in \r\nterms of our production and consumption habits.\r\nTwo months later, the adoption of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change came to complete that \r\nimportant campaign through a package of actions \r\naiming, on the one hand, at limiting the rise in the \r\naverage global temperature to less than 2°C, thanks to \r\ncourageous measures to mitigate the causes of climate \r\nchange, and on the other hand, at taking measures to \r\nstrengthen resilience in the face of climate change. \r\nTherefore, the theme of this session — “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld” — is very much in line with the transformational \r\nvision and mission of the climate-change programme.\r\nThe evaluation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) in late 2015 showed that even though \r\nnot all the Goals were met, remarkable progress had \r\nindeed been made. We note in that connection that in \r\nthe fight against poverty, the goal of halving the number \r\nof people living in extreme poverty was achieved in \r\n2010. Similarly, in education, the number of school-\r\nage children not in school was halved, and in the health \r\narea, infant and maternal mortality was also halved. \r\nUnfortunately, those positive results hide huge \r\ndisparities and inequalities. In fact, those results were \r\nstrongly influenced by progress in Asia and Latin \r\nAmerica owing to high and sustained growth rates there \r\nover the period. African countries, especially those in \r\nthe sub-Saharan region, have seen little progress and \r\ncontinue to face significant challenges in terms of \r\ndevelopment and the fight against poverty.\r\nThe results obtained through the achievement \r\nof the MDGs are the starting point from which we \r\nbegin our journey towards fulfilling the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2030. Our capacity to achieve \r\nour goals by that deadline will depend on our ability \r\nto change political and economic conditions, both in \r\nindividual countries and on a global scale. It will also \r\ndepend on our ability to honour the commitments we \r\nundertook at the Paris Conference on Climate Change.\r\nTurning to political and economic conditions, \r\nthe current situation does not inspire optimism. It is, \r\ntherefore, essential that we create a new type of political \r\nand economic governance worldwide. In the economic \r\nsphere, it is obvious that the functioning of the global \r\neconomy must be fully re-evaluated. We need to find \r\na better balance between speculative financial capital \r\nand industrial capital by orienting more capital towards \r\nthe real economy. Such a new approach would enable \r\ndeveloping countries to receive more capital and more \r\ninvestment. That, in turn, would sustain stronger \r\neconomic growth, which would lead to global economic \r\ngrowth and stability.\r\nInternational measures to support direct foreign \r\ninvestment in the least developed countries are \r\nimportant, something that we should put in place as \r\nsoon as possible. They are crucial in the framework \r\nof the support that that group of countries requires \r\nin order to realize economic and social development. \r\nThe fact that such a programme seeks to strengthen \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n8/58 16-29667\r\nassistance to those countries that need it most, \r\nspecifically the least developed countries, reveals the \r\ninclusive dimension of the programme. We welcome in \r\nparticular the willingness to step up the implementation \r\nof the Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries for the Decade 2011-2020, reaffirmed in the \r\nIstanbul Declaration, and the Programme of Action \r\nresulting from the Midterm Review Conference for the \r\nIstanbul Programme of Action for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, held in Antalya, Turkey, last May.\r\nThe Technology Bank for the Least Developed \r\nCountries, whose first three-year strategic plan \r\nwas approved by its governing body in July, will be \r\ncommissioned in 2017 and will be a valuable instrument \r\nfor promoting infrastructure development, diversifying \r\nproduction and creating added value. That is essential \r\nfor strengthening income-generation and increasing the \r\nincomes of people in those countries.\r\nReforming the international financial system, \r\ncreating new possibilities for access to sources of \r\nfinancing, and establishing an adequate framework for \r\nrestructuring sovereign debt are all are indispensable \r\nmeasures if we are to strengthen the economic \r\ncapabilities of developing countries in the area of \r\nfinancing sustainable development. The same applies \r\nto mobilizing the private sector and encouraging it to \r\ntake a greater stake in working towards the goals of \r\ncollective development.\r\nWith regard to the United Nations, we encourage \r\nthe long-term positioning of United Nations funds, \r\nprogrammes and agencies to favour development. \r\nSuch an approach is about promoting consistency and \r\ncomplementarity, which are key for the development \r\nwork of those entities to be effective. Programmes that \r\nare at the centre of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) must make it possible for Africa to become \r\nbetter integrated into global trade. But that integration \r\nwill be beneficial to the continent only if we put an end \r\nto the unequal terms of trade. \r\nSeveral studies have in fact demonstrated that \r\nif the share of African countries in global trade were \r\nto increase by only 1 per cent, that would provide \r\nadditional annual income of more than $200 billion — \r\nabout five times the amount received by Africa in the \r\nform of official development assistance. Concretely, \r\nAfrica would receive greater resources if the unequal \r\nexchanges were discontinued. \r\nAfrica must also have the firm political resolve to \r\ndevelop intra-African commerce, which now accounts \r\nfor only 10 per cent of trade. We need for it to reach a \r\nlevel that would strengthen our position in global trade. \r\nReaching the Sustainable Development Goals will \r\nbe feasible only with greater synergy in action, robust \r\nsolidarity and, most importantly, respect for all of the \r\ncommitments undertaken by the global partnerships \r\nfor development.\r\nOn the political front, the United Nations needs \r\nthorough reform. The governance of the United Nations, \r\nin particular the Security Council, needs to be reviewed. \r\nThat process is long overdue. The Organization should \r\nbe made effective and legitimate in the way it addresses \r\nessential issues of peace and international security. The \r\nreform must rectify the existing anachronisms — both \r\nthe current system of geographical representation in the \r\nCouncil, and the methods whereby decisions are taken. \r\nThe consequences of those methods are sometimes \r\ndisastrous and have had effects that are the opposite of \r\nwhat is sought.\r\nOn the modalities of Security Council \r\ndecision-making, it is essential that the countries most \r\naffected in issues before the Council, especially the \r\nneighbouring countries of countries in conflict, be \r\ninvolved and heard in the conflict-resolution process. \r\nNeighbouring countries, which often share the same \r\ncommunities on both sides of the borders, are the first \r\nto suffer from the effects of conflict. The Council must \r\ntherefore absolutely take into account the concerns \r\nexpressed by those countries so as to avoid situations of \r\nthe kind that currently exists in Libya.\r\nThe field of peacekeeping operations is of particular \r\ninterest to the Niger, a country that is engaged in a \r\nmerciless struggle against terrorism and in protecting \r\nits territory. Based on experience, and faced with the \r\nevidence of the inadequacy of current approaches to \r\npeacekeeping, which have shown their limits on many \r\noccasions, we are convinced that those approaches \r\ncan and should be improved. In that regard, the Niger \r\nbelieves that the mandates of certain United Nations \r\nmissions urgently need revision so as to strengthen \r\ntheir offensive capabilities, with a view to improving \r\ntheir ability to respond to the challenge of protecting \r\ncivilians. \r\nMy country fully supports a major strategic change, \r\nparticularly given the general trend of attacks by warring \r\nparties and other non-State groups against civilians. \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 9/58\r\nFor the populations concerned, it is inconceivable \r\nthat, in the face of terrorist acts and abuses inflicted \r\non local people, the peacekeeping missions deployed \r\non the ground to protect them are powerless to avert \r\nthe imminent massacres of civilians at the most crucial \r\nmoments. The missions must be able to take decisive \r\nand effective action.\r\nIn reality, no one can predict what is going to \r\nhappen between now and 2030. All we can say is that we \r\nwill not be able to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals unless there is a profound change in political and \r\neconomic governance. We live in an uncertain world. \r\nWe live in an unstable world that is facing all types \r\nof visible and invisible threats. Achieving the SDGs \r\nin an unstable and chaotic world will therefore be a \r\nnon-linear, unstable and chaotic process that can suffer \r\ngreat impacts from small things. \r\nI recall the famous metaphor of the so-called \r\nbutterf ly effect, whereby a butterf ly f lapping its wings \r\nin Brazil can cause a storm in Texas. The butterf ly effect \r\nis that drop of water that makes the vase overflow. The \r\nsigns of tension that we see here and there in the world \r\ncan be the little sparks that might provoke a vast fire. \r\nThese signs of tension are currently being obscured \r\nby the fight against terrorism, but the rivalries and \r\nother competitions among the great Powers can lead to \r\nirreparable consequences.\r\nSmall countries often bear the costs of the rivalries \r\nof the great Powers and suffer the consequences of \r\nsome of their failures to understand. The chaos that \r\nwe are currently seeing in Libya and its impacts on \r\nneighbouring countries attest to that fact. Those effects \r\nand the presence of terrorist organizations in northern \r\nMali and in the Lake Chad Basin, where Boko Haram \r\nis committing atrocities, could irreparably compromise \r\nthe ability of the countries affected to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals by 2030. In the Niger, \r\nwhere Boko Haram carries out regular incursions, we \r\nhave more than 167,000 internally displaced persons, \r\nabout a 100,000 refugees at risk of starvation and \r\nepidemics, and more than 18,000 children who cannot \r\ngo to school. It is therefore urgent that we stabilize the \r\nsituation in Libya. It is urgent that we help Libya to \r\nemerge from that chaos. It is urgent that we stabilize \r\nMali and neutralize terrorists. It is urgent that we \r\nsupport the Multinational Joint Task Force that is \r\noperating in the Lake Chad Basin against Boko Haram.\r\nThe terrorist threats at our doorstep have led our \r\ncountry to redirect significant resources to the security \r\nsector. Without that, the Niger could have achieved \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals and started the \r\nprocess of implementing the SDGs under much better \r\nconditions. Ten per cent of our budgetary resources have \r\nbeen oriented towards defence and security. In spite of \r\nthat, the Niger was able to reduce poverty from 63 per \r\ncent in 2011 to 45 per cent in 2015, to achieve MDG \r\n1, on reducing extreme hunger and poverty by half, \r\nGoal 4, on significantly reducing child and maternal \r\nmortality, and the MDG target on access to water and \r\nsanitation in urban areas.\r\nOur recovery programme will allow us to \r\nfurther improve those results and move toward the \r\nimplementation of the SDGs. My ambition is to leave \r\nthe country, at the end of my last term, radically \r\ntransformed — a Niger where democratic institutions \r\nare stronger, where the fight against corruption has made \r\ngreat strides, and where inequalities have been beaten \r\nback and the middle class has grown; a united, peaceful \r\nand safe Niger with zero hunger and well equipped with \r\ninfrastructure of every kind; a Niger that has made \r\ngood progress on its demographic transition process, \r\nwhere school is free and compulsory for all persons \r\nunder 16 years, where 40 per cent of our children attend \r\nvocational and technical training and leave with a trade \r\nor profession, and where universities train the most \r\ncompetent professionals for the subregion; a Niger with \r\naccess to health, where clean water and sanitation are \r\nensured and where employment, specifically for young \r\npeople, is abundant; and, finally, a country resolutely \r\nengaged on the way to the unity of our continent — in \r\nother words, a Niger resolutely set along the way to the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French) On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of the Niger for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of the \r\nRepublic of the Niger, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n10/58 16-29667\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Faustin Archange \r\nTouadéra, President of the Central African \r\nRepublic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Central African Republic.\r\nMr. Faustin Archange Touadéra, President of the \r\nCentral African Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Faustin Archange Touadéra, President of the \r\nCentral African Republic.\r\nPresident Touadéra (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, may I warmly congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session. He may rest assured of the \r\nfull support of my delegation in working towards the \r\ncomplete success of this session of the Assembly.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark on the \r\noutstanding way in which he presided over the previous \r\nsession. May I also pay warm tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, not only for what he has done \r\nsince the previous session, but also for all the laudable \r\nwork he has so untiringly carried out to achieve the \r\nnoble objectives of the United Nations since he was \r\nelected 10 years ago. I particularly commend and am \r\ngrateful for his personal involvement and focus on my \r\ncountry, the Central African Republic, during the hard \r\ntimes that it has passed through.\r\nIt is a great honour for me to address the Assembly \r\nto describe the evolution of the situation in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and to share with it my country’s vision \r\nregarding the major issues facing our Organization. \r\nI stand before the Assembly today to bear witness \r\nto the entire international community of the recognition \r\nby the Central African people of the invaluable support \r\nto my country, the Central African Republic, which has \r\nnow returned to stability and constitutional legality. \r\nFrom this rostrum, on behalf of the Central African \r\npeople, I wish to pay tribute to all actions carried out by \r\nthe United Nations system, particularly in connection \r\nwith the deployment of the international forces who \r\nare at this very time working to bring security and \r\npeacebuilding in my country.\r\nI wish to express once again the gratitude of \r\nthe people of the Central African Republic to the \r\ninternational community in its entirety for its solidarity \r\nand constant support during our efforts to return to \r\nconstitutional legality, thereby putting an end to the \r\npolitical transition that was established after the coup \r\nof 24 March 2013.\r\nMay I also acknowledge the spirit of the people of \r\nthe Central African Republic, who, in such large and \r\ndetermined numbers, voted in an exemplary election, \r\nthus demonstrating their espousal of democracy and \r\nconstitutional order. I also pay a warm tribute to the \r\nentire political class in the Central African Republic \r\nfor the maturity it displayed to the entire world in \r\nrespecting the voice of the people in the elections. \r\nAs President, in whom is vested the trust of the \r\nentire Central African people, I have taken stock of the \r\nimmense challenges we face and the expectations of my \r\nfellow citizens, who understandably yearn for peace, \r\nnational reconciliation and socioeconomic development.\r\nThe Central African Republic has turned the page \r\non its dark history. Central Africans are more than ever \r\ndetermined to finally break the cycle of violence so \r\nas to be able to aspire legitimately to peace, security, \r\njustice, freedom and sustainable development. Since \r\nmy accession to the presidency of the country, steps \r\nhave been taken to ensure that the Government and all \r\nState institutions share the common goal of rebuilding \r\nthe country through the necessary reforms.\r\nNo State can claim to be able to develop while \r\nits economic, social or indeed its political fabric \r\nremains plagued by the evils of corruption, injustice \r\nand impunity. I can assure the Assembly that the fight \r\nagainst corruption is at the heart of our concerns. \r\nTherefore, the Government that I have the heavy \r\nresponsibility of leading will spare no effort to establish \r\na mechanism for the relentless fight against corruption \r\nand financial crime.\r\nThe Central African Republic has certainly begun \r\nto revive the democratic process, but the situation still \r\nremains fragile. Much remains to be done. That is why as \r\nsoon as I was inaugurated as President of the Republic, \r\nI expressed my ambition to bring together all Central \r\nAfricans around a State reconstruction project, so that \r\nwe in the Central African Republic would become the \r\nmasters of our own destiny and of the development of \r\nour country.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 11/58\r\nI am committed to leading the work for a political, \r\neconomic, social and cultural transformation that will \r\nenable us to dispel the evils of insecurity, the dysfunction \r\nof political institutions, corruption, the deterioration of \r\nliving conditions and the loss of moral standards, all \r\nof which have undermined our society. The priorities \r\nof my Government are therefore based on four main \r\npillars: peace and security, national reconciliation and \r\nadministrative reform, economic recovery, and justice \r\nand human rights.\r\nWith regard to peace and security, the imperative \r\nfor the Government consists in the rapid application \r\nof the disarmament, demobilization, rehabilitation and \r\nrepatriation programmes so that all Central African \r\nmen and women of all walks of life can live in peace \r\nand security with one another throughout the land. \r\nSimilarly, security-sector reform remains a major \r\nconcern of the Government. A delegation of the \r\nCentral African Republic outlined the strategies and \r\nprogrammes for such reforms in the Central African \r\nRepublic at United Nations Headquarters in June. A \r\ndecision was taken to support my country’s endeavours \r\nin the recognition of the efforts at dialogue with armed \r\ngroups that I have undertaken since my assumption of \r\nresponsibility. That is why I am taking this opportunity \r\nto urge a major mobilization of our partners at the \r\nnext Brussels Conference for the Central African \r\nRepublic, scheduled for 17 November, with regard \r\nto their contribution to finance the security-sector \r\nreform component.\r\nOn the issue of the restoration of State authority \r\nand the process of redeploying the Administration, the \r\nGovernment has undertaken, with the assistance of the \r\ninternational community, including the United Nations, \r\nactions to ensure the presence of public authority \r\nthroughout the territory and tot ensureg peace and \r\nsecurity. The defence and security forces must therefore \r\ncontinue to bolster our border control against the threats \r\nof cross-border crime, the proliferation of small arms \r\nand light weapons, money-laundering, trafficking in \r\ndrugs and narcotics, and terrorism, particularly by the \r\nLord’s Resistance Army, and human trafficking.\r\nThe Government has undertaken emergency \r\nmeasures aimed at rebuilding the Central African armed \r\nforces, which will help to enable the establishment \r\nof an inclusive republican army. To achieve that, the \r\nCentral African Republic, through me, calls for the \r\ntotal lifting of the arms embargo imposed on it. It must \r\nbe remembered that the ban, even if necessary at the \r\ntime, is no longer justified today in this new era of \r\nnational reconstruction.\r\nJustice and human rights involve the rehabilitation \r\nof the institutions of the judiciary so as to guarantee \r\nthe rights of citizens and strengthen the fight against \r\nimpunity. In that regard, it is appropriate to strengthen \r\nthe Special Criminal Court for the Central African \r\nRepublic so as to bring the perpetrators of crimes to \r\njustice before the competent courts and to deal with the \r\nissue of reparations for the harm suffered.\r\nConcerning economic recovery, the Government \r\nhas implemented reforms aimed at improving the \r\nbusiness climate in order to attract private investment \r\nand has committed itself to reestablishing State \r\ninfrastructure to support growth. The cyclical, \r\nrepetitive crises in the Central African Republic have \r\nled to the precarious living conditions of our people and \r\nto widespread impoverishment. I welcome the fact that \r\nthe international community has understood what is at \r\nstake here.\r\nMy Government, for its part, is firmly committed \r\nto peacebuilding, national reconciliation, the \r\nre-establishment of the defence and security forces \r\nand an economic recovery plan. Those are our goals; \r\nthose are our priorities. I have every confidence that, \r\ntogether, Central Africans will pursue those goals with \r\nall their strength and all their energy.\r\nThe Central African Republic is once again among \r\nMember States. The Central African Republic has \r\ntaken its place as a free and democratic State among \r\nthe community of nations. It is ready to contribute to \r\nbuilding a world of peace, tolerance, freedom, justice \r\nand democracy. Despite our determination to take \r\ncharge of our destiny, the Central African Republic \r\nis still fragile, absolutely in need of the support of all \r\nour partners, both bilateral and multilateral. On behalf \r\nof my country, I again call for the support of fellow \r\nMember States.\r\nThe United Nations remains the indispensable \r\nforum par excellence for addressing global issues and \r\nresearching appropriate solutions. As a Member, the \r\nCentral African Republic can assure the Assembly \r\nof our abiding commitment to the ideals of the \r\nOrganization, founded on the values of equality, peace, \r\nsecurity, justice and development, to which all peoples \r\nthroughout the world aspire.\r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n12/58 16-29667\r\nI welcome the relevance of the theme of the \r\nseventy-first session of the General Assembly: \r\n“Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push to \r\ntransform our world”, chosen a year after the adoption \r\nof the new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The \r\nchoice of that theme is justified by the desire to see \r\nthose Goals realized by 2030. For the time has come to \r\nreverse the trend of extreme poverty, which continues, \r\nunfortunately, in many parts of the world, particularly \r\nin sub-Saharan Africa. The time has come to reduce \r\ninequalities between rich and poor and to create an \r\nenvironment that provides a good place to live for the \r\nwell-being of everyone.\r\nIt is recognized that the majority of the least \r\ndeveloped countries and post-conflict countries, \r\nincluding the Central African Republic, did not attain \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). There \r\nare several reasons for that, chief among them political \r\ninstability. In fact, in 2011 the Government developed \r\na framework for accelerating the effort to achieve \r\nthe MDGs dealing with hunger and food security, \r\nbut the crisis of 2012 ended those actions, leaving \r\nthem incomplete.\r\nThe Central African Republic has officially \r\nlaunched the implementation process for the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, involving all \r\nnational stakeholders — the public administration, \r\ncivil society, the private sector, international \r\npartners, development partners and international \r\nnon-governmental organizations. That clearly indicates \r\nthe willingness of the Government resolutely to lead \r\nthe process of achieving the SDGs and avoid the uneven \r\nresults that characterized the process of the attainment \r\nof the MDGs, for the reasons I cited earlier.\r\nThe Government learned lessons from the \r\nexperience and has undertaken to implement the \r\nSDGs on new bases involving partnership and the \r\nparticipation of all strata of our society. Thus the \r\nGovernment has undertaken, within the framework of \r\nits national reconstruction policy, the preparation of a \r\nrecovery and peacebuilding programme in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic that includes humanitarian assistance, \r\nearly recovery and development. There are three main \r\nplanks: peace, reconciliation and security; the renewal \r\nof the social contract between the State and the people; \r\nand economic recovery and the revitalization of the \r\nproductive sectors.\r\nTo achieve this, the Government intends to \r\ndevelop a partnership with national and international \r\nnon-governmental organizations, the private \r\nsector, development partners and community-based \r\norganizations so as to create the synergies necessary to \r\nemerge from the crisis. To that end, the planned study on \r\nthe vision of the Central African Republic through 2040 \r\nwill be carried out within the framework of the 2063 \r\nAgenda for Africa and will include concrete objectives.\r\nWith the support of technical and financial \r\npartners, we will set up an appropriate institutional \r\nframework for the follow-up and monitoring of the \r\nwork to achieve the SDGs. Under its auspices we will \r\ndefine our priorities in the context of the recovery and \r\npeacebuilding programme, the recommendations of \r\nthe Common African Position and the conclusions of \r\nthe consultative regional meeting on the SDGs, held in \r\nOctober 2013.\r\nThe issue of migrants and refugees, which affects \r\nthe entire world, has in recent years worsened and is \r\nnow a major concern of the international community. \r\nIt is a very pressing problem that requires the attention \r\nof every country, regardless of their involvement in the \r\nmanagement of migratory f lows.\r\nThe high-level meeting that was just held was an \r\nopportunity to highlight the pressing global challenges \r\ncaused by these mass movements of peoples, in order to \r\ndevise well-thought-out solutions within a framework \r\nof international responsibility-sharing. I welcome the \r\ncommitment of Member States to seek a more humane \r\nsolution to the issue. At the Valletta Summit on \r\nMigration and the first Global Humanitarian Summit, \r\nheld in Istanbul, world leaders shared their views on the \r\nroot causes of migration and displaced persons.\r\nIn the Central African Republic, sustainable \r\nsolutions to ensure the return of our compatriots \r\nwho have been displaced within our country to their \r\nareas of origin, as well as to the issue of refugees, are \r\nbeing studied in order to create a national platform \r\nfor disaster risk management and the prevention and \r\nmanagement of poor socioeconomic conditions such as \r\nlow wages, unemployment, underemployment in rural \r\nareas, poverty and lack of resources, which are very \r\noften the cause of these movements.\r\nOn climate change and sustainable development, it \r\nis urgent that the world adopt sound policies that can \r\ngenerate growth and take into account the problem of \r\nclimate change. Such growth must be able to reduce \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 13/58\r\npoverty. Protection of the environment, effective \r\nmanagement of resources, and economic growth \r\nintegrated into green growth provide a valuable \r\nopportunity for African countries. It is not fair that \r\nAfrica should pay a higher price when it is but a victim. \r\nThat is why I urge the international community to \r\nfocus in particular on the adoption of an appropriate \r\nmechanism to support Africa. The commitments made \r\nat the Paris climate summit must be respected so as to \r\nbring about true sustainable development.\r\nBefore I conclude, let me say that we trust \r\nthat Member States all will decide to provide our \r\nOrganization with the means to attain the 2030 \r\nSustainable Development Goals. The Central African \r\nRepublic will continue to make its modest contribution \r\nto our Organization and in our common quest for peace, \r\nsecurity and development for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Central African Republic for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Faustin Archange Touadéra, President of the \r\nCentral African Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Azali Assoumani, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Union of the Comoros.\r\nMr. Azali Assoumani, President of the Union \r\nof the Comoros, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Azali \r\nAssoumani, President of the Union of the Comoros, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Assoumani (spoke in French): I welcome \r\nthis opportunity to address the General Assembly for \r\nthe first time since my election as President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros. I am very grateful to the people \r\nof the Comoros, who have made it possible for me to \r\nspeak here on their behalf.\r\nI would like, from this lofty rostrum, to congratulate \r\nthe people of the Comoros, who have been able to turn \r\nthe page in terms of achieving political stability and \r\nto put aside useless discord to work together for the \r\nbenefit of future generations.\r\nI am indeed the fourth President in 20 years to \r\nhave been elected in a free, transparent and democratic \r\nelection with internationally recognized results. My \r\ncountry has experienced its third peaceful handover of \r\npower, in which the opposition replaced the legitimate \r\nincumbent following peaceful elections.\r\nI thank the international community and all of our \r\npartners, and the United Nations system in particular, \r\nfor having always stood by our side. I hope that after \r\nthe election their assistance will help us to consolidate \r\npolitical stability and to preserve democracy and the \r\nrule of law, so as to bring about the economic and \r\nsocial development of the country and the well-being \r\nof our people.\r\nLet me take this opportunity to congratulate the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\non his election to head this seventy-first session. I am \r\nconvinced that his experience and his proven knowledge \r\nof international issues, added to his personal brilliance, \r\nwill lead the Assembly to great success at this session. I \r\ncannot fail to pay tribute to his predecessor, Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, for having brilliantly led the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. \r\nLet me also hail the efforts of Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon. He has shown great talent throughout his \r\nterm. As he nears the time to relinquish his duties, I wish \r\nto join in the unanimous tributes to his commitment \r\nto promoting peace, development and fighting climate \r\nchange. The people and the Government of the \r\nComoros are deeply grateful for the interest he has \r\nalways shown in the development of the Union of the \r\nComoros and, in particular, for the special attention that \r\nhe paid to our most recent electoral process, ensuring \r\nits smooth running and its final results, which were \r\nunanimously accepted.\r\nLet me lastly applaud all those who have spoken \r\nfrom this rostrum for their pertinent remarks, in \r\nparticular His Excellency President Barack Obama, \r\nwho is also approaching the end of his term. He \r\nperfectly represents the United States of America – the \r\ntolerant America, the generous America, respectful of \r\nthe universal values of freedom and the rule of law, and \r\nthe America that the world wants.\r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n14/58 16-29667\r\nThe theme of the current session is “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”. It fits in perfectly with the decision taken by \r\ninternational leaders 15 years ago to establish a set \r\nof world objectives: the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. The theme also encourages us to build on the \r\nconsiderable progress made in the years that have \r\nfollowed: a steady decline in poverty throughout the \r\nworld, an increasing number of children in school, \r\nspectacular gains in lowering child mortality, greater \r\naccess to drinking water, and progress in the fight \r\nagainst malaria, AIDS and tuberculosis, which has \r\nhelped to save millions of lives.\r\nIndeed, considerable efforts have been made to \r\nhelp our world achieve greater prosperity, equality, \r\nfreedom and respect for human dignity, and to become \r\na place where research and peacekeeping tirelessly \r\npersevere. Furthermore, the ambitious new long-term \r\nprogramme that we adopted last year to improve the \r\nlives of our population and to protect the planet for \r\nfuture generations enables us to optimistically perceive \r\na future when we can reduce poverty, improve health \r\nand education, build a more sustainable habitat, fight \r\nclimate change and protect our oceans and forests.\r\nHowever, the issue of refugees and migrants, which \r\nhas been the focus of our debate since the start of the \r\ncurrent session, requires urgent action. We are all well \r\naware that those migrant men and women do not put their \r\nlives at risk, perilously travelling over land and sea, for \r\npleasure or for tourism; instead, they are f leeing from \r\nwar, poverty and misery. The theme of this session, \r\n“The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push \r\nto transform our world”, comes at just the right time, \r\nas it allows us to envisage sustainable development and \r\neven to stabilize populations at home, so that they can \r\nmove only out of choice and in perfect harmony.\r\nAnd so it is up to our Organization, and therefore each \r\none of us, to take immediate action to stop the violence \r\nthat is a result of all kinds of extremism and fanaticism, \r\nleading to heinous and barbaric acts around the world, \r\nparticularly in Africa, which is currently experiencing \r\nterrorism that knows no borders. Terrorists are neither \r\nMuslim nor Jewish, neither Catholic nor animist. They \r\ndo not belong to any religion or any civilization — they \r\nare merely barbarians. That is why my country, the \r\nUnion of the Comoros, is willing to support all actions \r\naimed at fighting the scourge of terrorism.\r\nIt is also urgent that our Organization, that is to \r\nsay every Member State, finally agree on a definitive, \r\nfair and sustainable solution to the Israel-Arab conflict, \r\nbased on a two-State solution and in accordance with the \r\nrelevant United Nations resolutions. Nothing can justify \r\nour silent response to the terror of that conflict with its \r\ntoll of victims, which is fuelled both by the extremism \r\nthat comes from all sides and by our culpable inertia. \r\nNothing can justify the arrogance of those who, from \r\nthis very rostrum, defy the world by taunting this world \r\nbody, an Organization that provides a framework for all \r\nto recognize the sovereignty of States, to participate in \r\ninternational affairs and to seek peaceful solutions to \r\nthe problems aff licting us. \r\nFor my part, I wish to convey the trust of my \r\npeople in the United Nations, an Organization that \r\nhas acknowledged our sovereignty and independence, \r\nand that, 41 years later, makes it possible for us to be \r\nhere. I believe that finding a solution to the issue of the \r\nsovereignty of the Palestinian people and resolving that \r\n70-year-old conflict will spur the resolution of other \r\nconflicts in the Near and Middle East.\r\nAllow me, at this stage in my address, to respectfully \r\ndraw the Assembly’s attention to the need to draw a \r\ndistinction between migrants and internally displaced \r\npersons. My country, the Union of Comoros, had its \r\nsovereignty recognized by the United Nations in 1975. \r\nIt is made up of four islands, and, like other countries, \r\nwe have observed the subsequent, unavoidable \r\nmovement of our population within islands and between \r\nislands, including the island of Mayotte — which is, \r\nunfortunately, still under French administration. Those \r\ntrips are made to visit family, celebrate marriages, go \r\nto the burial of a close relative and for various other \r\nreasons. And yet they descend into chaos on a daily \r\nbasis — every year and every month, those trips lead to \r\ndeaths of hundreds of our fellow citizens in the channel \r\nbetween the three islands and the island of Mayotte, to \r\nthe indifference of the international community.\r\nThe Assembly is fully aware of the issue concerning \r\nthe island of Mayotte and has devoted no fewer than 15 \r\nresolutions to the issue since 1977. Unfortunately, it has \r\nyet to be resolved. We hope that, with the Assembly’s \r\nmultifaceted support, a viable solution will be found \r\nto accommodate both the Comoros and France — two \r\ncountries that, in spite of that dispute, have remained \r\npartners and have established friendly relations over \r\nthe years. I am convinced that the dialogue that I \r\ninitiated with President Chirac in 2005, and which \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 15/58\r\nhas been pursued by successive French and Comorian \r\nGovernments, will help to solve our unpleasant dispute. \r\nWe must engage in frank and intelligent dialogue, \r\nrespecting the interests of both parties and, above all, \r\ninternational law, in order to make it possible for future \r\ngenerations of French, Comorian and Franco-Comorian \r\npeople to live in peace and harmony and to be protected \r\nfrom the radicalization and extremism that have \r\nweakened regions all over the world.\r\nToday, the United Nations is the only place where the \r\nworld’s population can come together and look towards \r\na common future of shared peace and prosperity — for \r\nwhich we have high expectation from this Organization, \r\nwhich regulates the international system. However, our \r\nOrganization is increasingly perceived as inefficient in \r\nterms of defending the rights of the most deprived in \r\nrelation to the most powerful. The Union of the Comoros \r\nis also in favour of broad reform of the United Nations, \r\nechoing the ideas of a large number of countries, in \r\nparticular with regard to the need to grant Africa a \r\npermanent seat on the Security Council. We believe that \r\nrespect for international law, the sovereignty of States \r\nand the integrity of their territories will contribute to \r\ngreater peace and prosperity throughout the world.\r\nThere are other challenges to be overcome before we \r\ncan achieve sustainable development. We must eradicate \r\npoverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity for all \r\nwithin the framework of the new Agenda within the \r\nnext 15 years. As a small island developing State, the \r\nUnion of the Comoros seeks to turn the private sector \r\nand civil society, together with the Administration, into \r\ndrivers of the struggle to transform economic growth, \r\nin particular in Africa, so as to provide decent job \r\nprospects for young people, improve services, develop \r\nagriculture and reduce inequalities deriving from \r\nincome, gender and living environments. All that is so \r\nwe can deal successfully with the emerging problem of \r\nclimate change.\r\nMr. Ali (Bangladesh), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nI want to end on an optimistic note. Getting back \r\nto the theme of the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nI want to pay tribute to His Excellency Mr. François \r\nHollande, President of the French Republic, and \r\ncongratulate him on the success of the twenty-first \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change. \r\nHis commitment and capacity for mobilization enabled \r\nthe eventual adoption of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change. My country signed \r\nthe agreement and will submit it for ratification by the \r\nParliament during its session in October.\r\nOn this occasion, I wish every success to His \r\nMajesty King Mohammed VI, whose beautiful country, \r\nMorocco, will host, in Marrakesh in 2017, the twenty-\r\nsecond session of the Conference of the Parties . With the \r\npermission of my friend, His Majesty King Mohammed \r\nVI, I invite the entire international community to go \r\non that occasion to Morocco, which fully deserves to \r\nhost the twenty-second Conference of the Parties. The \r\nsuccess of the Conference will contribute to reducing \r\ninsecurity, which is a destabilizing factor in many \r\nregions in the world, particularly in Africa, where \r\npeople have been the most likely to resort to migration, \r\nwhich is a global concern that we addressed on the \r\nopening days of our session. Indeed, the success of the \r\nConference will be reflected in improvements in our \r\ndaily life and will provide a tangible contribution to \r\npeople’s well-being and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Union of \r\nthe Comoros for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Azali Assoumani, President of the Union of \r\nthe Comoros, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour \r\nHadi Mansour, President of the Republic of Yemen\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Yemen.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi \r\nMansour, President of the Republic of Yemen, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mansour (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, allow me to express our thanks and appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General for all the sincere efforts he \r\nhas made and continues to make to ensure the success \r\nof the peace process in Yemen and to put an end to \r\nthe suffocating crises that plague Yemen. We thank \r\nhis Special Envoy for Yemen, Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n16/58 16-29667\r\nAhmed, for all of his good efforts, which we praises \r\nand support. I wish to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson \r\non his assumption of the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. We wish him \r\nevery success in fulfilling his noble mission.\r\nLast year from this rostrum I made a promise \r\nto restore Yemen’s legitimacy (see A/70/PV.17). I \r\ncame to New York from Aden, the interim capital \r\nof Yemen, months after the coup d’état against State \r\ninstitutions — which was led by the militias of the \r\nHouthis and former President Saleh -- had plunged \r\nYemen into a meaningless war, tearing apart its social \r\nfabric and decimating its economic and financial \r\ncapabilities and infrastructure. \r\nToday I address the Assembly while the State \r\nleadership at home is running the State from inside, \r\ndespite all the difficulties. The Vice-President and the \r\nGovernment in its entirety in the liberated governates \r\nhave aborted this destructive scheme led by Iran \r\nthrough mercenaries in Yemen. Today the coup forces \r\nare motivated by a vendetta against the people, pushing \r\nwomen and children to the fronts of death without any \r\nconscience or humanity. \r\nWe did not fire the first shot in Yemen’s war. We \r\nwere in Sana’a before the coup. We have repeatedly \r\ncalled for an end to the wars, tragedies and conflicts \r\nthat have been destroying Yemen over the past 50 years \r\nas a result of a corrupt Government, the selfish control \r\nof national wealth and power, heavy centralization and \r\nthe neglect of most of the regions of the country.\r\nAll of those factors led to an increase in tensions \r\nand the eruption of the popular revolution against the \r\nformer regime in February 2011 in order to bring about \r\nchange. I called on everyone to build a cherished, \r\ndemocratic, civilian federal State in which human \r\nrights, the specifities of all the regions of Yemen, the \r\ndignity of women, the rights of children and the rights \r\nof all marginalized social groups are respected.\r\nThe Assembly may recall that I stood here four \r\nyears ago (see A/67/PV.9) and spoke about the steps \r\nthat we had taken and that we would take on the path \r\ntowards a political transition of State power in the \r\ncontext of the Gulf Cooperation Council’s initiative and \r\non the basis of United Nations resolutions. I told the \r\nAssembly then that Iran was blocking all the measures \r\nthat we were taking through a variety of actions and \r\ninterventions. Today, we are suffering the consequences \r\nof its meaningless practices via the Houthi and former \r\nPresident Saleh’s coup militias, whose actions have \r\nturned everything upside down. \r\nWe presented to the world a remarkable and unique \r\nexperience, one unprecedented in the history of Yemen \r\nand the region, through the comprehensive national \r\ndialogue conference in which all parties participated.. \r\nIt addressed the problems of Yemen in depth and drew \r\nup a road map for its future, which led to the drafting \r\nof a new federal civilian Constitution. We were on \r\nthe cusp of building a new Yemen and completing the \r\ntransitional phase when those militias carried out a \r\ncoup against the State, its legitimacy and the national \r\nconsensus. \r\nThe battles raging today are none of our doing. \r\nThey were imposed on us by the coup by the Houthi/\r\nSaleh militias’ coalition, which turned against the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council Initiative and Implementation \r\nMechanism and the outcome of the dialogue. They \r\nrejected the national consensus and took over the capital \r\nand certain governorates. At a time when everyone else \r\nwas embracing peace and national partnership, they \r\nwere shooting everyone, besieging cities and killing \r\ninnocent people in order to safeguard their interests \r\nfor power and wealth and seizing the capacities of the \r\ncountry and plundering its resources.\r\nLet me stress that we are not advocating revenge. \r\nWe do not seek to eliminate anyone from the Yemeni \r\nlandscape. Rather, we extend our hands to all to build \r\na new Yemen. Despite the extensive damage caused \r\nby the coup scheme on the political, social, economic \r\nand cultural fronts, we continue to see the rebels as a \r\nYemeni group that must return to reason. We do not \r\ntake away their right to a future. \r\nWe are still yearning for a life in dignity and safety \r\nfor all Yemenis. Our project is one of life, construction, \r\nhope and stability for the new Federation of Yemen. It \r\nis a project for all Yeminis, who painstakingly drafted \r\nits parameters in the national dialogue and its outcome. \r\nIt calls for a federal State founded on justice and the \r\nequitable distribution of power and wealth. More than \r\nonce we have urged them to demonstrate their loyalty \r\nto their homeland, and we have called on them to \r\ndissociate themselves from the State that did not bring \r\nanything to Yemen except destruction and fuel for wars.\r\nThe peace we aspire to cannot accept control by \r\nmilitias and sectarian gangs of the State’s capacities, \r\nover medium and heavy weapons and missles that \r\ntarget the security and stability of Yemen, the Arabian \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 17/58\r\nPeninsula and the Gulf region. Our endeavours for \r\npeace can never overshadow the great sacrifices \r\nmade by our people and their noble objectives. Any \r\nappropriate solutions should aim to end the coup and all \r\nits consequences, first and foremost by making sure the \r\narmed militias withdraw, surrender their weapons and \r\ngive up the institutions they are controlling. Afterward, \r\nwe should  complete the political process by endorsing \r\nthe new draft Constitution and hold general elections.\r\nTherefore, we welcomed and cooperated with all \r\nsincere efforts that the United Nations made, as well as \r\nwith all other ideas contributed to bring about peace. \r\nBut they were rejected by the party involved in the coup, \r\nwhich refused to entertain them in a positive spirit.\r\nWe want to tell the world in very clear terms that \r\nextremism and sectarian terrorism sponsored by Iran \r\nin the region have bred and will continue to breed \r\ncounter-extremism that feeds on terrorism. Brutality \r\nand terrorism, as demonstrated by those involved in the \r\ncoup against the Yemeni people, feed and nourish the \r\nseeds of terrorism. We are all suffering from terrorism. \r\nThis is why, on behalf of all Yemenis, I declare our full \r\ncommitment to relentlessly combating terrorism. But \r\nlet me stress that we cannot defeat terrorism in Yemen \r\nwithout tackling its root causes, the most important of \r\nwhich is the extremism and vindictive acts of terrorism \r\nby the Houthi/Saleh militas.\r\nThe political vacuum caused by the war, and the \r\neconomic depression triggered by the black-market \r\npolicies that impoverished the State and plundered its \r\nresources, were executed by the coup militias from \r\nthe very beginning. They all led to a situation of stark \r\npoverty that is being exploited by terrorist groups to \r\nenlist people, recruit children, stockpile weapons and \r\ntake control of cities. Unless we take effective measures \r\nto address those root causes, Yemen and the entire \r\nregion will continue to suffer.\r\nFor the Yemenis, the criminal acts perpetrated by \r\nthe militias, including the systematic killing of civilians, \r\nchildren and the elderly, especially in Taiz Governorate, \r\nthe abductions and forced disappearances, the besieged \r\ncities, and the suppression of public freedoms of the \r\nYemeni people are acts of terrorism on a par with those \r\nperpetrated by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, \r\nDa’esh, Al-Qaida and other terrorist groups. The \r\nterrorism inflicted on the Yemeni people at the hands \r\nof the coup militias is similar to what they suffered at \r\nthe hands of Da’esh and Al-Qaida.  The Yemeni people \r\nare the only people who are affected by the Yemini \r\nversion of Da’esh, Al-Qaida and Hezbollah. The world \r\nshould understand the Yemeni people’s priorities to \r\nattain freedom and fighti all terrorist groups, with their \r\ndifferent forms and categories. The fait accompli policy \r\nwhen dealing with extremists constitutes a dangerous \r\ninternational precedent because it confers legitimacy \r\non the violent and terrorist rebel groups that are forcibly \r\nimposing their will on the people.\r\nThe militias involved in the coup diverted the \r\nmandate of the Central Bank of Yemen from its main \r\nmission at a time when the economy of Yemen was on \r\nthe brink of collapse, turning it into a tool of war against \r\nthe Yemeni people. The militias used the resources of \r\nthe Central Bank to fund the war, undermining their \r\nindependence, systematically plundering their assets \r\nand devaluing the local currency with the aim of \r\nexhausting our cash reserves. Those are irresponsible \r\neconomic policies. We therefore decided to move the \r\nCentral Bank to the interim economic capital, Aden, to \r\nsave what could still be saved and to prevent the total \r\ndepletion of the reserves.\r\nNo one will benefit from this situation except \r\nterrorists, violent groups and the black-market trade \r\nnetworks. We wish to stress to the whole world that \r\nwe took that step only after exercising considerable \r\npatience. Finally, our patience ran out after we assessed \r\nthe dangers inherent in allowing the Bank to continue \r\nto be controlled by irresponsible militias that work for \r\nthe profit of their leaders and are bent on impoverishing \r\nthe people and the State institutions. The motivating \r\nidea was to end the war by restricting the f low of funds \r\nto those militias. In that connection, we call on the \r\nfree world and its financial institutions to support and \r\nstand by us and to respond to these measures to save \r\nthe Yemeni economy and to prevent the militias from \r\ncontrolling the future of Yemen. \r\nThe situation in the wake of the destructive war \r\nimposed on our people is a result of the plundering of \r\nthe State’s resources, the manipulation of the Central \r\nBank’s assets, the erosion of foreign currency reserves, \r\nthe non-use of the local currency and the promotion \r\nof trade war, black-market practices and smuggling \r\nby the militias. These factors augur dangerous times \r\nfor Yemen. We will not be able to pay the salaries of \r\ncivil servants, which will exacerbate the humanitarian \r\ncatastrophe at hand. The situation requires action and \r\nassistance by the international community to support \r\nthe Government of Yemen in its efforts to generate \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n18/58 16-29667\r\neconomic recovery and reconstruction. Let me stress \r\nthat the Central Bank of Yemen remains fully committed \r\nto fulfilling its national and international obligations.\r\nNotwithstanding the declarations of support every \r\nyear, the strategic humanitarian plan for Yemen devised \r\nby the United Nations covers only a small portion of the \r\ngrowing essential needs that people are experiencing \r\nin the catastrophically difficult situation in Yemen. \r\nI take this opportunity to renew my call on all donor \r\ncountries to fulfil their pledges and to provide more \r\nassistance in order to alleviate the suffering of Yemen. \r\nThe Government of the Republic of Yemen wants to \r\nensure that urgent humanitarian aid is delivered to \r\nall who are in need of it in all governates of Yemen, \r\nwithout exception. In that regard, I commend the great \r\neffort mounted by the King Salman Humanitarian Aid \r\nand Relief Centre and the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\nrelief and humanitarian organizations.\r\nThe Yemen that we aspire to build — the Yemen that \r\nwill emerge from the ruins of the unjust war imposed \r\non it by the Houthi/Saleh militias — will be better \r\nintegrated into its immediate regional surroundings. \r\nIt will be cognizant of its strategic and geopolitical \r\nposition in the Arabian peninsula and the Gulf. \r\nOn this occasion I reiterate our thanks and gratitude \r\nto my brother King Salman bin Abdulaziz, Custodian \r\nof the Two Holy Mosques, and to the Government and \r\npeople of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, as well as to \r\nthe President and the Government of the United Arab \r\nEmirates and to all our kin in the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil and the Arab Coalition for the restoration of \r\nlegitimacy in Yemen. \r\nThree days from now, our great Yemeni people \r\nwill celebrate the anniversary of the landmark Yemeni \r\nrevolution of 26 September 1962, which declared Yemen \r\na democratic republic. We recall with pride the glorious \r\nachievements of Yemen and the struggle of our Yemeni \r\nheroes. Allow me, from this rostrum, to stress to our \r\npeople that the path of sacrifices charted by Yemenis in \r\ntheir struggle against backwardness and the Imamate \r\nsystem of government is being complemented today \r\nby the sacrifices of new heroes, who are defending \r\nthe revolution and the Republic. We stand behind the \r\noverwhelming majority of Yemenis until victory and \r\nuntil we defeat the legions of the Imamate system and \r\nits heirs -- the former regime and its new version led by \r\nthe treacherous Houthi/Saleh alliance — and halt their \r\nendeavours to establish a racist, theocratic system of \r\ngovernment based on the “rule by the Islamic jurist”. \r\nWe reaffirm to our people that victory has never been \r\ncloser.\r\nAllow me  to address our people from this rostrum as \r\nwe celebrate the glorious anniversary of the revolution. \r\nTo our Yemeni people who have suffered injustice, \r\nbereavement, displacement, f leeing, disappearance, \r\nkillings and hunger, our dear and generous people, I say \r\nwith a great deal of confidence that their sacrifices will \r\nnot be in vain, that their aspirations will be fulfilled. \r\nWe are bound to be victorious, and, God willing, we \r\nwill carry out our just project. We will extract Yemen \r\nfrom the claws of Iran. We will raise the Yemeni f lag \r\nover our precious national soil, every square foot of it, \r\nand we will lay the foundation for a just federal State. \r\nAll along, we have been and we will continue to be \r\npioneers of peace and security, advocates of love and \r\nharmony, advocates of dialogue and consultation. \r\nThe current situation truly pains me; it is \r\nheartbreaking for any Yemeni to see blood shed \r\nanywhere. I am responsible for all of Yemeni territory \r\nand people, from one end of the country to the other. \r\nNothing is in my heart except the concerns of my \r\npeople, my homeland and my desire to see my country \r\nenjoy prosperity and peace. We will continue to deal \r\npositively and patiently with all. We will make all \r\nnecessary sacrifices in order to restore social peace and \r\nrecover our national cohesion in accordance with our \r\nconstitutional and moral responsibility vis-a-vis the \r\nsuffering of our people in all parts of the country. \r\nI feel ashamed that the Yemeni people have had \r\nto endure the persistent failures of successive Yemeni \r\nGovernments over the past 50 years. In both the north \r\nand south of Yemen, they were unable to meet the five \r\nbasic necessities of our people: water, health care, \r\neducation, electricity and road networks. But there is no \r\npoint in crying over a bygone era and its Governments. \r\nHave our people not suffered enough death and \r\ndestruction? Have the authors of the coup d’état — the \r\nHouthi/Saleh militias — not heard the humanitarian \r\ncalls from this international forum to cooperate with \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Envoy to Yemen \r\nin order to implement what we have agreed upon? I \r\nrefer to the established terms of reference of the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council Initiative and its Implementation \r\nMechanism, the outcomes of the national dialogue, \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions, particularly \r\nresolution 2216 (2015), and the outcome of the peace \r\ntalks in Kuwait.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 19/58\r\nFrom this rostrum, I wish to express our thanks \r\nand gratitude to His Royal Highness Sheikh Sabah \r\nal-Ahmad al-Jaber al-Sabah, and our brother people of \r\nKuwait. \r\nIn conclusion, I wish to draw attention to the \r\nforemost issue of a just solution regarding the question \r\nof Palestine and its capital -- the Holy City of Jerusalem. \r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic of \r\nYemen for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jocelerme Privert, Acting President \r\nof the Republic of Haiti\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Acting President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti.\r\nMr. Jocelerme Privert, Acting President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jocelerme Privert, Acting \r\nPresident of the Republic of Haiti, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nActing President Privert (spoke in French): I have \r\nreal pleasure in extending, on behalf of the delegation \r\nof the Republic of Haiti and in my own name, warm \r\ncongratulations to Ambassador Peter Thomson on \r\nhis election as President of our Assembly. His proven \r\nexperience in international issues and his outstanding \r\npersonal qualities bode well for the success of the \r\nseventy-first session.\r\nI would also like to give a special greeting to the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, for his outstanding performance at the head \r\nof our Organization, particularly his commitment to \r\npeace and the promotion of development in the world. \r\nHaiti’s voice joins in the unanimous praise which \r\ncrowns his second mandate in that office.\r\nSeventy-one years ago, the fifty original States \r\nMembers of the United Nations took the solemn and \r\ndecisive commitment to build a new world order based \r\non fundamental human rights. Before a world emerging \r\nfrom the tragedies of a terrible war, they championed \r\nthe equality of men’s and women’s rights, the inviolable \r\nprinciple of parity of the subjects of international law \r\nand the right of peoples to self-determination. In a \r\npraiseworthy endeavour to heal the wounds of recent \r\nconflicts, they advocated better living conditions for \r\nthe people of the world under the aegis of freedom \r\nand democracy.\r\n From this rostrum, Haiti declares the raison d’être \r\nof our Organization to be more relevant in today’s \r\nworld than ever before. In the face of a succession \r\nof threats posed by the spectre of ecological peril, \r\nterrorist brutality and the persistence of various \r\nregional conflicts, we must reassert our faith in the \r\npurposes of our Organization. The values it embodies \r\nand the precepts it defends and promotes in the analysis \r\nand management of major contemporary issues and \r\nchallenges are more pertinent than ever. Today it is \r\nmore essential than ever that the United Nations fully \r\nassume its role in order to provide collective responses \r\nto all manner of crises threatening peace in the world.\r\nThe encroachments of terrorism and the international \r\nproblems of an economic, social and humanitarian \r\nnature are among the issues that the United Nations \r\nmust address, in keeping with its original mission of \r\nhuman understanding and solidarity. \r\nThe Republic of Haiti is proud to have participated \r\nin the founding of the Organization. We strongly \r\nsupport the measures it undertakes to strengthen and \r\nbroaden the scope of its actions. We also welcome the \r\ninitiatives for necessary reform, particularly within the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nHaiti stands alongside and encourages the United \r\nNations in its intentions to strengthen its capabilities \r\nin the conduct of peacekeeping operations, the fight \r\nagainst pandemics and health crises and the promotion \r\nof democracy and human rights, without overlooking or \r\nneglecting economic, social and cultural rights.\r\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change perfectly \r\nillustrates the concept of a collective destiny for all \r\npeoples that lies at the heart of this Organization. This \r\nvision has inspired urgent and united international \r\naction in the face of an issue that threatens the very \r\nsurvival of our planet. The Agreement represents \r\nunquestionable success, and we sincerely hope that \r\nall established commitments and obligations are \r\nfollowed through.\r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n20/58 16-29667\r\nThe progress made over the past seven decades, \r\nwhether in terms of human rights, peacekeeping or \r\ninternational development cooperation, is undeniable. \r\nThis is in large part thanks to the powerful and generous \r\nvision that inspired the founders of our Organization, \r\na vision that remains as potent as ever. While \r\ncongratulations are in order for recent advances, some \r\nof which are truly remarkable, I would particularly like \r\nto acknowledge the peace agreement recently signed \r\nin Havana by the Government of our sister Republic \r\nof Colombia with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of \r\nColombia. We are forced to admit, however, that the \r\nobstacles hindering peace and sustainable development \r\nin the world remain numerous. Nevertheless, we \r\nwelcome the recent rapprochement of the United States \r\nof America with Cuba, which is likely to further peace \r\nin our region.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti encourages the international \r\ncommunity to pay further attention to the aspirations \r\nof the Republic of China on Taiwan to play a more \r\nactive role in certain decisions and initiatives that \r\ncould contribute to stability and reconciliation among \r\npeoples and nations.\r\nOur delegation is particularly sensitive to two of the \r\nissues being addressed at the current session. I refer to \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and to the issue of refugees, migrants and \r\nthe forced displacement of people. \r\nThe next 15 years will provide a detailed \r\ndemonstration of the actions and efforts of the peoples \r\nof the planet, resolutely engaged in a noble struggle \r\nto eradicate poverty and hunger in the world. The 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) will be both our \r\ncompass and our milestones throughout humankind’s \r\njourney towards a world free of unacceptable \r\ndeprivation, shortcomings and failures.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti chooses to be among the \r\nStates on the front line as we head towards sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Having acknowledged what is at stake, \r\nmy Government has courageously decided to lay the \r\nfoundations for our dedicated participation in the global \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and to put our country firmly on track \r\ntowards inclusive and sustainable development. \r\nThrough the purposeful appropriation of the \r\nSDGs and their integration into Haiti’s development \r\npolicies and strategies, we are enabling the country \r\nto take concrete action that will help to improve the \r\nliving conditions of every Haitian. In that context, I \r\nfully support the adoption in Hangzhou by the Group \r\nof 20 of an action plan aimed at facilitating the launch \r\nof a sustainable development programme for 2030 and \r\nsupporting the industrialization efforts of African and \r\nleast developed countries. We have great hopes for the \r\ncoming years.\r\nWe also pay particular attention to the Goals’ \r\napproach to the issue of migration. Migration f lows \r\nhave always been at the core of the dynamics among the \r\nworld’s peoples. However, we are all very concerned \r\nabout recent large increases in the frequency and \r\nnumbers of people f leeing conflict zones, including \r\nwomen and children, and the human tragedies that \r\nbefall those sometimes desperate attempts. Needless to \r\nsay, the Republic of Haiti can particularly relate to the \r\nissue, and we welcomed the high-level meeting on the \r\nsubject held at the beginning of this session. We hope \r\nthat concrete decisions, equal to the magnitude of the \r\ntragedies and risks faced by displaced populations, can \r\nbe taken to protect them. We also urge that substantial \r\nsupport be provided to help host countries. We believe \r\nit is vital to take every possible step to combat the \r\ntraffickers who abuse the good faith of those f leeing \r\npoverty and misery.\r\nThe Haitian delegation is well aware of the growing \r\nnumber of our compatriots who are leaving the country \r\nin search of a better life elsewhere. We understand and \r\nhave taken on board the legitimate concerns that have \r\nbeen expressed by representatives of some countries \r\nof destination or transit, some of them from this very \r\npodium. This human tragedy calls for specific decisions \r\nand measures that can offer the Haitian people new \r\nopportunities and better living conditions. To that end, \r\nwe need peace, political stability, development-oriented \r\ninfrastructure, entities that will help to strengthen the \r\nrule of law and a better understanding of the major \r\nsocioeconomic challenges that we face. We have \r\nlaunched a dialogue with various host countries with \r\nthe aim of finding shared solutions.\r\nAt this point, I would like to briefly paint a picture \r\nof the current situation in Haiti. In about two weeks, the \r\nHaitian people will go to the polls. The mandate that \r\nthe National Assembly conferred on me at my election \r\nwas unequivocal: restore Haitians’ confidence in the \r\nelectoral process, reinstate constitutional order by \r\ncompleting the electoral cycle begun in 2015 and hold \r\nfair, credible, transparent and democratic presidential \r\nand legislative elections. That is the task I have been \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 21/58\r\nworking on unceasingly for the past seven months. The \r\ninauguration of the new President of the Republic on \r\n7 February 2017 will be the culmination of the process \r\nof renewing and strengthening Haiti’s republican \r\ninstitutions. Make no mistake — without fair and \r\ncredible elections, any hope of a peaceful political \r\ntransition is a vain illusion. A smooth transition \r\nremains the prerequisite and foundation for political \r\nstability, consolidation of the rule of law, economic \r\nmodernization and development.\r\nIt is crucial to ensure that the forthcoming elections \r\nare credible if we are to effectively break the cycle of \r\ninstability and the political uncertainty that has dogged \r\nmy country for too long. In upholding my commitment \r\nto the Haitian people, I have spared no effort to help to \r\ncreate the conditions and atmosphere that are essential \r\nto the proper conduct of the elections, and impartial \r\nobservers have unanimously noted the progress we have \r\nmade on restoring our institutions and constitutional \r\norder. Parliament is now up and running and will be \r\nfully functional after the elections. The elected mayors \r\nhave gradually taken up their functions, and that \r\nprocess has gone sooothly..\r\nThe Government is deeply respectful of the \r\nindependence and prerogatives of the Provisional \r\nElectoral Council in organizing the elections. In \r\nresponse to the people’s expectations and following up \r\non the recommendations of our Independent Electoral \r\nEvaluation and Verification Commission, the Council \r\nhas made appropriate fixes to remedy the manifest \r\ndeficiencies in the electoral machinery. These have been \r\nwelcomed by every sector, including the candidates \r\nthemselves and the national and international observers.\r\nVoter confidence in the integrity of the electoral \r\nprocess is a major factor in citizens’ participation and \r\nthe legitimacy of both the election results and those \r\nelected. So far, the new Provisional Electoral Council, \r\nwhich I established in broad consultation with the \r\ncountry’s driving forces, has demonstrated its ability \r\nto conduct the electoral process successfully. Despite \r\ndealing with various technical and logistical obstacles \r\nin circumstances of financial penury, the Government \r\nhas shown its willingness to take on the financial \r\nburden of the elections. I am pleased to say that the \r\nprocess is on the right track.\r\nWhile the elections are not an end in themselves, \r\nthey represent a necessary transition. The legitimacy \r\nof the new Haitian authorities will depend on their \r\nsuccess. The day after the elections, our country will \r\nneed to feel a powerful wave of international solidarity. \r\nOur new leaders will need that solidarity in order to \r\naddress our structural problems, to ensure that they \r\ndo not end up undermining Haiti’s efforts to emerge \r\nfrom underdevelopment and to enable them to tackle \r\nthe colossal task of turning our economy around after \r\ndecades of regression. They will need it in order to \r\nundertake the reforms that are essential to our economic \r\nand social modernization and in order to make the \r\nmassive investment in our failing infrastructure and \r\nthe training of the human resources that the country so \r\ndesperately needs.\r\nOn behalf of the Haitian people, I take this \r\nopportunity to commend the immense efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations Stabilization Mission in Haiti, whose \r\nmandate will soon be the subject of a Security Council \r\nresolution. The progress that has been made during the \r\nMission’s 12 years in Haiti may seem slow to many \r\nobservers, but it is nonetheless real, especially in \r\nthe areas of security, promotion of human rights and \r\nbuilding the capacities of institutions that ensure the \r\nrule of law, particularly through the Mission’s support \r\nto the Haitian national police and the judiciary.\r\nThis is also an opportunity for me to salute the \r\ngreat courage and leadership of the Secretary-General. \r\nAt the end of his second term, I urge him to accept the \r\nidea that my country needs international understanding \r\nif it is to tackle the challenges of the lack of sanitation \r\nthat continues to expose it to epidemic and endemic \r\ndisease and illnesses from all sources. In recent years, \r\nmy people have suffered tremendously from waves \r\nof infectious diseases such as malaria, cholera, Zika, \r\nchikungunya and dengue, among others. To overcome \r\nthese scourges, declaration of good intent, comforting \r\nthough they are, are of no effect and cannot yield \r\nresults. We require real and effective sanitary support \r\nwith respect to drinking water and waste treatment.\r\nThe renewed outbreak of cholera in recent months \r\nis one of the most acute challenges facing Haiti. It is \r\na clear illustration of the perceptible deterioration in \r\nthe humanitarian situation, as the Secretary-General \r\nstressed in a recent report to the Security Council \r\n(S/2016/753). In this connection, the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti has noted and welcomed the statements \r\nof the Secretary-General on two situations that have \r\nbeen discomforting for the United Nations: the many \r\ncases of sexual abuse perpetrated by peacekeepers, and \r\nthe introduction of cholera to Haiti.\r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n22/58 16-29667\r\nThe recognition by the United Nations of its moral \r\nresponsibility in the latter instance opens the way for \r\nreal discussions as to the need to definitively end this \r\npandemic, which affects many of my fellow citizens. \r\nHere we trust that the urgent appeal of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for a substantially strengthened programme to \r\ncombat cholera and to provide material assistance to \r\nvictims and their families will be heeded and will fully \r\nmeet the expectations of the people of Haiti.\r\nHaiti is once again at a crossroads. The immediate \r\nfuture of the country hangs on the success of the \r\nforthcoming elections, but so too does the road that \r\nthe country will take in coming years. At this historic \r\njuncture, the people and the Government of Haiti \r\nattach the greatest importance to the solidarity of the \r\ninternational community and to the cooperation of \r\nthe United Nations and its Member States to ensure \r\nthe success of the forthcoming elections, which, we \r\nfirmly believe, will mark a decisive stage in the lengthy \r\nprocess of consolidating democracy and bringing about \r\nthe rule of law in our country.\r\nAs I conclude, I once again reaffirm that the \r\npeople of my country have confidence in the United \r\nNations and in the ideal of universal solidarity, of \r\nwhich the United Nations is the most lofty and constant \r\nembodiment. Through me, the people of Haiti reiterate \r\nonce again their belief in our Organization’s capacity to \r\nbuild peace in the world, increase cooperation among \r\npeoples and help deprived populations to take charge of \r\ntheir destiny in the context of a new international order \r\nthat is more just, has a greater spirit of solidarity and \r\nis a harbinger of hope and opportunity for all, so that \r\neveryone can have the opportunity to enjoy its share \r\nof progress.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Acting President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jocelerme Privert, Acting President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister of State, Minister for Communication \r\nand Media, and Minister for Worship of the \r\nGrand Duchy of Luxembourg\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Prime Minister, Minister of State, \r\nMinister for Communication and Media, and Minister \r\nfor Worship of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg.\r\nMr. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Communication and Media, \r\nand Minister for Worship of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Xavier Bettel, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister of State, Minister for Communication \r\nand Media, and Minister for Worship of the Grand \r\nDuchy of Luxembourg, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Bettel (Luxembourg) (spoke in French): May I \r\nfirst of all congratulate Mr. Thompson on his assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. I wish also to take this opportunity to thank \r\nhis predecessor, whose outstanding work enabled us to \r\nmodernize and render more transparent an entire series \r\nof processes, including that leading to the selection of \r\nfuture Secretaries-General of our Organization.\r\nI also wish to commend the exemplary commitment \r\nof our Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, as his mandate \r\nand his decade of service to our Organization draws \r\nto a close. He has rightly stated, as fact and as an \r\nimperative, that we are the first generation that can put \r\nan end to poverty, and we are the last generation that \r\ncan act so as to avoid the repercussions of unbridled \r\nclimate change.\r\nA year ago virtually to this day, we adopted, \r\nin this very Hall, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Today we must implement this ambitious \r\nuniversal programme and maintain the 2015 momentum. \r\nI therefore welcome the selection of the theme “The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push to \r\ntransform our world” for this session of the Assembly. \r\nWe must work to ensure that no one is left behind and \r\nthat we can all can reap the benefits of sustainable, \r\njust and equitable development. The year 2015 was \r\nalso marked by the adoption of the Paris Agreement, \r\nwhich Luxembourg strongly committed to during its \r\npresidency of the Council of the European Union.\r\nThe time has come to implement these international \r\nagreements and to ensure that the commitments that we \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 23/58\r\nhave made internationally and nationally bear fruit. \r\nWe must chart a course to a sustainable future for \r\ncoming generations.\r\nLuxembourg is actively working to implement the \r\n17 Sustainable Development Goals and will be among \r\nthose States ratifying the Paris Agreement at the end of \r\nthe year. We must act in an inclusive manner, involving \r\nthe various stakeholders and ensuring that our policies \r\nare consistent, particularly in the area of development, \r\nso that we can strike a balance between the economic, \r\nenvironmental and social pillars.\r\nWe must invest in education and health care. We \r\nmust fight social inequality, ensure decent work for all \r\nand provide robust social protection systems.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nMy country is among the seven countries that spend \r\nat least 0.7 per cent of gross national income on official \r\ndevelopment assistance; this has been the case since \r\n2000. Official development assistance has an important \r\nrolе to play, but we must also mobilize other sources \r\nof funding. Faced with the relative decline in financial \r\nresources for development and humanitarian action, it \r\nis more urgent than ever to broaden the donor base.\r\nThe first World Humanitarian Summit, in which \r\nI had the honour to take part last May in Istanbul, \r\nmade it possible to reassert the principles governing \r\nhumanitarian action: humanity, impartiality, neutrality \r\nand independence. As a signatory to the grand bargain, \r\nLuxembourg will seek to increase the predictability and \r\neffectiveness of its humanitarian contributions through \r\nmulti-year agreements. We also intend to strengthen \r\naid by allocating 5 per cent of funding directly to local \r\norganizations by 2020.\r\nSharing, giving and helping are not words we hear \r\nmuch among many of my constituents these days. But \r\nare we aware of how fortunate we are? While in our \r\ncountry some parents must decide only if the dinner \r\nthey will serve their children will be hot or cold, in \r\nother countries the question is, when will I be able to \r\ngive my children some food?\r\nThe high-level meeting held earlier this week \r\nreminded us that the challenge posed by mass \r\nmovements of refugees and migrants in recent months \r\nand years can be addressed only globally. In the \r\nsecond half of 2015, my country held the presidency \r\nof the Council of European Union. Migration was, \r\nunfortunately, at the centre of our concerns during the \r\npresidency. Personally, I have learned a few lessons \r\nfrom that experience. On the European level, solidarity \r\nand burden-sharing are also indispensable to a credible \r\nmigration policy that includes border controls or \r\nrespects the Dublin Regulation.\r\nIt is necessary to clearly distinguish between \r\nrefugees in need of protection and irregular economic \r\nmigrants. Most of the refugees in need of international \r\nprotection have had to f lee situations of war, sometimes, \r\nas in the case of Syria, through mass exoduses. The role \r\nof our Organization is crucial in conflict prevention, \r\npeacebuilding, peacekeeping and the responsibility to \r\nprotect civilian populations.\r\nA large part of the migration towards European \r\ncountries is also economic. One cannot treat with \r\ncontempt those who, for themselves or for their loved \r\nones, often embark on a long and dangerous journey. \r\nWe cannot fail to welcome them, but it is difficult to \r\naccommodate all of them. At stake, as we know very \r\nwell today, is the acceptance of our opinions. Populism \r\nis being nourished by the feeling that matters are not \r\nunder control. Some people profit from the confused \r\nsituation by exploiting it for their own purposes. When \r\nI hear, as I did again this week, a political candidate \r\nsay that a refugee may be a terrorist, I condemn such \r\nstatements in the firmest possible terms. That is \r\nbecause a person who has left his country is a victim of \r\nterrorism, not a perpetrator.\r\nI believe that we need to keep the paths of legal \r\nmigration open, not merely because developed \r\ncountries, notably those in Europe, need them, but also \r\nbecause it would be mistaken and dangerous to declare \r\nan end to all migration. Migration, when it is controlled, \r\ncan constitute an opportunity for everyone. We must, \r\nI think, provide sufficient development opportunities \r\nto avoid disorderly movements. The approach adopted \r\nat the European Union-Africa summit, held in Valletta \r\nin 2015, seems to me to be a good one. Europe has \r\ncommitted itself to strengthening assistance to its \r\nAfrican partners with increased cooperation on \r\nmigratory f lows at the borders. In the view of my \r\ncountry, it is an additional effort and not challenging to \r\nthe existing models of cooperation and assistance.\r\nBut what has happened since the Valletta Summit? \r\nThe meetings provided an opportunity for dialogue, but \r\nit is essential to honour the commitments and to act. I \r\nthink that the high-level plenary meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on 19 September can help to deal with all \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n24/58 16-29667\r\nthose problems at an appropriate level: on the global \r\nlevel of our Organization. The population displacement \r\nhas affected all regions of the world. It also affects those \r\ncountries that are experiencing precarious situations \r\nfor their own populations. As the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) invites us \r\nto do, we will actively participate in the work for the \r\nadoption in 2018 of a global compact on refugees and a \r\nglobal compact for safe, regular and orderly migration.\r\nArmed conflict, the proliferation of weapons, the \r\nlack of development, violent extremism, radicalization \r\nand terrorism, threats posed by climate change, poor \r\ngovernance and violations of human rights continue \r\nto dominate the daily news. Terrorist attacks have \r\nshaken the Middle East and Africa, Europe, the United \r\nStates and Asia. The effects of climate change manifest \r\nthemselves in increasingly extreme weather patterns \r\nthat disproportionately affect the most vulnerable \r\nStates and populations, creating tension and unrest and \r\npushing people to migrate to places they hope will be \r\nmore clement. Armed conflicts persist or are likely to \r\nbreak out, endangering the survival of thousands of \r\ncivilians, exposing them to violence, including sexual \r\nviolence, and threatening their most basic rights.\r\nThe African continent remains particularly \r\nvulnerable to both internal and external challenges and \r\nshocks. I do not wish to recite a litany of ongoing or \r\npotential crises. Rather than give a gloomy account of \r\ncurrent events, I want to comment on the remarkable \r\ndevelopment potential of the African continent. I am \r\npersuaded that, together, we can act so that peace can \r\nbecome a reality in South Sudan, Somalia, Libya and \r\nthe Central African Republic. It is up to the parties to \r\nthose conflicts to bring about their settlement, thereby \r\nreducing the suffering of the population and paving \r\nthe way for sustainable development. The international \r\ncommunity is ready to assist and support their efforts \r\nfor the restoration and consolidation of peace.\r\nAfrica has formidable resources. In the first place, \r\nit has a pool of extraordinary talent represented by its \r\nyouth. It is important to focus on education, health \r\nand job creation in the context of inclusive national \r\ndevelopment policies that make use of the human \r\npotential and natural resources of Africa. Such policies \r\nshould aim to reduce poverty and inequality, reduce \r\nvulnerability to shocks and create countless prospects \r\nfor the development and f lourishing of the peoples.\r\nAfrica is a continent to which my country, \r\nLuxembourg, feels close because of strong ties \r\ndeveloped over many years as a result of our development \r\ncooperation policy. That partnership is a work in \r\nprogress and aims to meet the needs of the African \r\ncountries. Its focus has become increasingly economic, \r\nin complement to efforts hitherto concentrated on \r\nsocial sectors.\r\nThe United Nations remains the place the \r\ninternational community chooses as the forum for \r\naddressing the many multidimensional crises and \r\nchallenges our planet faces today. That is true of \r\nsustainable development. It is also the case in regard \r\nto combating terrorism. The United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy has established a political \r\nframework to combat terrorism while respecting \r\nhuman rights and individual freedoms. In that context, \r\nwe welcome the Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to \r\nPrevent Violent Extremism.\r\nWe all must also open the eyes of some young \r\npeople who in their past behaviour showed no such \r\ntendencies yet tomorrow want to fight against their \r\nown families. For what reason? Because of religion? \r\nAbsolutely not. They f lout and abuse Islam. They kill \r\ntheir own brothers and sisters. We must condemn such \r\nbehaviour. No religion can condone such savagery. \r\nIt is important to remind those young people that no \r\nreward awaits them. All they are doing is injuring their \r\nown religion.\r\nThe United Nations also plays a vital role in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and a \r\nparticular role is reserved for the Security Council. All \r\ntoo often, regrettably, the United Nations acts too late \r\nwhen a crisis has already erupted. We firmly endorse \r\nefforts to prevent crises or to avoid the recurrence \r\nof conflicts.\r\nLuxembourg strongly supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Human Rights Up Front initiative. Massive \r\nviolations of human rights are often the first signs \r\nof a crisis about to worsen. Since its establishment \r\nin 2005, we have played an active part in the work \r\nand discussions of the United Nations Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, and we support the Peacebuilding Fund. \r\nThe policy guidance and financial support provided \r\nby those entities have often been crucial in preventing \r\nthe relapse of post-conflict countries into conflict, and \r\nthey contribute to peacebuilding.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 25/58\r\nThe adoption by the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council this year of almost identical resolutions \r\nto bring about sustainable peace represents a paradigm \r\nshift. The resolutions put conflict prevention at the very \r\nheart of United Nations action, in line with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, which highlights the need to \r\ntake effective collective measures to prevent and avert \r\nthreats to peace.\r\nLuxembourg fully subscribes to the idea of moving \r\nfrom a post-conflict peacebuilding approach to one \r\nof sustaining peace. That includes activities aimed at \r\npreventing the outbreak, continuation or recurrence \r\nof a conflict, addressing the root causes and ensuring \r\nnational reconciliation with a view to reconstruction \r\nand development. Such an approach, resolutely \r\npolitical, integrates the three pillars of action of the \r\nUnited Nations — human rights, peace and security, \r\nand development. It is inclusive and is characterized \r\nby national ownership of efforts to sustain peace, in \r\nconformity with the wishes of all members of society \r\nand with the ongoing support of the international \r\ncommunity. We must turn these words into deeds. \r\nThe General Assembly can count on Luxembourg in \r\nthat regard.\r\nIf there is a conflict that should require us to \r\nredouble our efforts, it is the one in Syria. This \r\nconflict has given rise to an unprecedented movement \r\nof refugees towards neighbouring countries. Jordan, \r\nLebanon and Turkey are on the front line, then Europe \r\nand beyond. This situation is untenable. We must do \r\neverything possible to address this crisis as best we \r\ncan, observing international law and welcoming and \r\nprotecting refugees. We must do everything possible \r\nto put an end to this dreadful war that is destroying \r\nSyria and destabilizing the entire region. For more than \r\nfive years, Syria has been martyred both by the brutal \r\nrepression and atrocities carried out by the Al-Assad \r\nregime and by the abominable terrorist crimes \r\ncommitted by Da’esh and other terrorist groups that are \r\nrife in the country, profiting from a war economy and \r\nreceiving external support.\r\nThe toll is terrible. The United Nations estimates \r\nthat there have been more than 300,000 victims, \r\nincluding tens of thousands of children. An entire \r\ngeneration of children has been exposed to violence and \r\ndeath, deprived of fundamental freedoms, protection \r\nand education. Random air bombings and airdrops of \r\nbarrels of explosives, the use of chemical weapons, \r\nviolence and violations of international law continue \r\nwithout respite. Sieges are ongoing. Assistance is \r\ndenied and impediments to humanitarian aid continue. \r\nHumanitarian convoys are deliberately targeted. \r\nI take this opportunity to renew our appeal to the \r\nparties, in particular the Syrian authorities, to afford \r\nrapid, safe and unobstructed access by United Nations \r\nand humanitarian organizations throughout Syria. Even \r\nwar has rules. And so long as the war lasts, we must \r\ndemand and ensure that these rules and international \r\nhumanitarian law are respected. Those responsible for \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity committed in \r\nSyria, whatever they are, must be brought to justice, \r\nincluding before the International Criminal Court.\r\nI commend the repeated efforts of the United \r\nStates of America and Russia. They have led to a new \r\nagreement on cessation of hostilities that came into force \r\n10 days ago. This fragile agreement was renounced by \r\nthe Syrian army, then crippled by the unacceptable \r\nattack on a humanitarian convoy on 19 September. It \r\nmust be respected and scrupulously observed. \r\nThe solution to the conflict in Syria can be \r\nachieved through a political transition that meets the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Syrian people, in line with \r\nthe Geneva communiqué of 30 June 2012 (S/2012/523, \r\nannex) and Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). \r\nThe United Nations must play a determining role to \r\nfacilitate negotiations among Syrians to bring about a \r\npolitical transition that should include all members of \r\nSyrian society.\r\nOn 4 February, I attendeded, with our Minister \r\nfor Cooperation and Humanitarian Action, the London \r\n2016 donors conference, entitled “Supporting Syria \r\nand the region”. We will adhere to the commitment to \r\nprovide €37.5 million between 2016 and 2020 to help \r\nthe victims of the conflict in Syria and in neighbouring \r\ncountries, with an emphasis on children’s education, in \r\nparticular by supporting the UNICEF programme “No \r\nlost generation”.\r\nLast week, I returned from a visit to Israel and \r\nPalestine. While the Syrian conflict is hitting the \r\nheadlines, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a \r\nstrong factor for destabilization in the Middle East. \r\nIt is a catalyst for frustration and hatred that terrorist \r\nmovements in the region feed on brazenly. We cannot \r\nresign ourselves to allowing this conflict to continue. \r\nThe two-State solution is the only possible way of \r\narriving at a sustainable settlement of the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict. The parameters of this solution are \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n26/58 16-29667\r\nwell known and include the 1967 borders and Jerusalem \r\nas the capital of two States.\r\nDuring my recent visit, I encouraged Israeli and \r\nPalestinian leaders to resume direct dialogue. If there \r\nis no movement, the international community must \r\nplay its role. We also support initiatives such as those \r\ntaken by France to organize an international conference \r\nto help the parties to resume negotiations in order to \r\narrive at a two-State solution. We continue to believe \r\nthat the negotiating format should be broadened, with \r\nincreased participation of Arab and European countries. \r\nIn addition, the role of the Security Council should be \r\nreactivated and a reasonable deadline for the conclusion \r\nof negotiations should be established. \r\nIsrael has the right to live in peace and security. The \r\nPalestinians have the right to a sovereign, independent, \r\ndemocratic, contiguous and viable State. The two go \r\nhand in hand. There is no alternative to coexistence, \r\nin peace and security. It is important for them to stop \r\ntalking about each other and instead to talk to each \r\nother. Diplomacy can resolve the thorniest of problems. \r\nAs proof of this, a comprehensive solution to the issue \r\nof Iranian nuclear weapons was reached last year. \r\nWe must remain vigilant when it comes to the \r\nimplementation Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. \r\nNuclear non-proliferation efforts continue to be \r\nundermined by the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. The multiple ballistic missiles launched by \r\nNorth Korea and the recent North Korean nuclear test \r\nare in f lagrant violation of the international obligations \r\nimposed on the country by Security Council resolutions. \r\nThis provocative escalation is unacceptable. Apart \r\nfrom any Security Council measures that will be \r\ntaken, the Six-Party Talks on North Korea’s nuclear \r\nprogramme need to resume in order to bring about \r\nverifiable denuclearization of the Korean peninsula by \r\npacific means.\r\nIn all the areas I have touched upon, we recognize \r\nthat the United Nations has a leading role to play. As a \r\nfounding country of the United Nations, Luxembourg \r\nhas based its foreign policy on its active participation \r\nin multilateral cooperation, a multilateralism that is \r\nrooted in respect for international law and cooperation \r\namong sovereign and equal States. Our commitment to \r\nstrong and effective multilateralism, with the United \r\nNations at its heart, inspired us during our historic \r\nfirst term on the Security Council, in 2013-2014. This \r\nsame commitment led my Government to propose \r\nLuxembourg as a candidate for a seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for a two-year term in 2031 and 2032. Our \r\ncandidacy illustrates Luxembourg’s resolve to continue \r\nto serve the United Nations as a responsible member \r\nof the international community, dedicated to the \r\npurposes and principles embodied in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI shall leave New York this week with hope in my \r\nheart. The many speeches that we have heard in this \r\nHall show that dialogue is possible. Our credibility is \r\nat stake. The world expects action, not words. Let us \r\nget to work! \r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister of State, \r\nMinister for Communication and Media, and Minister \r\nfor Worship of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Xavier Bettel, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nState, Minister for Communication and Media, \r\nand Minister for Worship of the Grand Duchy of \r\nLuxembourg, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Moldova\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Moldova.\r\nMr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Filip (Republic of Moldova) (spoke in \r\nRomanian; English text provided by the delegation): I \r\nfeel honoured to participate for the first time, as the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Moldova, in the work \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nLet me start by warmly congratulating you, \r\nMr. President, on your election. My delegation wishes \r\nyou every success in your important mandate as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress, on behalf of the Government of the Republic \r\nof Moldova, our appreciation to Mr. Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis work as Secretary-General and his valuable efforts \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 27/58\r\naimed at redefining the role of the United Nations and \r\nadapting it to a world in continuous f lux. \r\nI would also like to thank the outgoing President \r\nof the General Assembly, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for \r\nshowing leadership and dedication during the previous \r\nsession and for promoting an inclusive and transparent \r\napproach to the process of selecting a new Secretary-\r\nGeneral.  We believe that such an innovative approach \r\nshould be used in future and that the criteria of equitable \r\ngeographic representation should be formalized so as to \r\nallow all regional groups to have been represented in \r\nthe highest elected post at the United Nations.\r\nWe call on all States Members of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly members of the Security Council, to elect \r\na Secretary-General from the Eastern European region, \r\nthe only region that has not been represented in this \r\nhigh position despite its having put forward a number \r\nof qualified candidates. The issue of gender equality \r\nshould be also considered in the selection process. We \r\nbelieve that a possible decision to elect a woman as the \r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General will have positive \r\nresonance with the growing international expectations \r\nin this regard.\r\nThe year 2016 has indeed been a difficult year for \r\nthe Organization. Serious conflicts and crises have \r\ncontinued to have a negative impact on international \r\npeace, security and stability. We have witnessed new \r\nand tragic manifestations of conflict in various parts of \r\nthe world, particularly in the Middle East and Africa. \r\nAll of us are deeply concerned by the ramifications \r\nand consequences of these conflicts, particularly the \r\nconflict in Syria.\r\nInternational terrorism and various forms of \r\nviolent extremism, fed by offensive ideologies, have \r\ncontinued to strike indiscriminately in countries \r\neverywhere, including Europe. The Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy and the Secretary-General’s Plan \r\nof Action to Prevent Violent Extremism lay out the \r\nactivities that need to be undertaken, individually \r\nand collectively, bearing in mind that some of their \r\nprovisions complement our national legislation, in \r\nparticular the law of the Republic of Moldova on \r\ncountering extremist activities.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova welcomes the General \r\nAssembly high-level meeting on addressing large \r\nmovements of refugees and migrants and the Leaders’ \r\nSummit on Refugees held earlier this week. The two \r\nhigh-level meetings allowed the participating States \r\nand organizations to discuss principles and policies \r\ndesigned to address migration and the refugee crisis. We \r\nshare the deep concern expressed about the challenges \r\nthe international system is facing in this regard. The \r\nlarge movements of people, the scale of migration and \r\nthe refugee crises, unprecedented since the Second \r\nWorld War, require a global humanitarian partnership \r\ncapable of delivering the needed protection, as provided \r\nfor by the international law.\r\nIn our view, it is important to bear in mind \r\nthe complex nature of motives that drive people to \r\nmove and to make a clear distinction among them. \r\nThe solutions identified should be tailored to every \r\nindividual situation, and a comprehensive global long-\r\nterm solution should be outlined, one that goes beyond \r\nan ad hoc emergency response. In this context, we \r\nappreciate the indispensable contribution made by \r\nthe International Organization for Migration (IOM), \r\nwhich joins the United Nations system as a full-f ledged \r\nagency pursuant to the Agreement concerning the \r\nRelationship between the United Nations and the IOM \r\nsigned on 19 September. We must also fight smuggling \r\nand trafficking in persons in a comprehensive and \r\nresolute manner.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova also attaches critical \r\nimportance to fostering development partnerships \r\naimed at supporting countries in need of assistance to \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \r\nIn our view, the United Nations development system is \r\nindispensable for forging such partnerships, including \r\nat the country level. We note with interest the progress \r\nachieved by those countries whose efforts to implement \r\nthe SDGs are already under way. Many were presented \r\nat the 2016 High-level Political Forum held under the \r\nauspices of the Economic and Social Council, where \r\nthe Republic of Moldova serves as a member.\r\nThe Moldovan Government, partnering with the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and other \r\nstakeholders, launched a process of localizing the \r\nSDGs and is currently working on putting in place a \r\nmechanism to measure progress in their implementation. \r\nFor coordination and monitoring purposes, the National \r\nCoordination Council for Regional Development was \r\nestablished in July within the Office of the Prime \r\nMinister. To ensure synergy between the SDGs and the \r\nnational development framework, we plan to review our \r\nnational strategy for development, “Moldova 2020”.\r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n28/58 16-29667\r\nMindful of the constraints in the current \r\ninternational environment — which is not promising in \r\nterms of increases in aid — we should look globally \r\nand nationally at ways to develop innovative sources of \r\nfinancing and increase the effectiveness of existing aid. \r\nThe efforts of the Moldovan Government to increase \r\naid effectiveness continue to be guided by the 2005 \r\nParis Declaration on Aid Effectiveness.\r\nCoordination with development partners in the \r\nRepublic of Moldova in this area is based on the \r\nPartnership Principles Implementation Plan. We \r\nbelieve that through the effective use of resources, this \r\ninstitutionalized model of coordination and partnership \r\nwill facilitate the gradual achievement of the SDGs in \r\nour country. In this context, I would also like to stress \r\nour interest in obtaining development financing and \r\nassistance for climate and disaster resilience, in the light \r\nof the climate-related vulnerabilities of our country.\r\nWe recognize climate-change risks and implications \r\nfor the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The \r\nRepublic of Moldova supported the negotiation and \r\nadoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nI take this opportunity today to inform the Assembly \r\nthat the Republic of Moldova signed the historic \r\nAgreement at the recent treaty event, an action that will \r\nbe followed soon by ratification of the Agreement by \r\nour Parliament.\r\nPerhaps never before has there been such a clear \r\ncorrelation between migration, sustainable development \r\nand climate change, on the one hand, and peace and \r\nsecurity, on the other. We cannot realistically expect \r\nto fulfil the 2030 Agenda in the absence of peace and \r\nsecurity, just as peace and security will always be \r\nvulnerable in the absence of sustainable development.\r\nThe unprecedented increase in the number of \r\nregional and internal conflicts, the intensification of \r\narmed violence at the global level and the resurgent \r\narms race are only a few ingredients that have \r\nfundamentally changed the international environment. \r\nInternational terrorism and all forms of violent \r\nextremism have continued to caused innocent human \r\ncausalities and material losses everywhere, including \r\nin Europe. The horrific scenes of suffering and death in \r\nFrance, Belgium, Germany and many other countries, \r\nwidely broadcast by the global media networks, show \r\nthat these phenomena cannot be countered by military, \r\npolitical or economic means alone. We must look for \r\nsolutions that will address rather than exacerbate the \r\nthreat, based on a clear understanding of the factors \r\nthat generate terrorism, fundamentalism, fanaticism \r\nand the new forms of violence.\r\nWe note with appreciation the Secretary-General’s \r\ninitiatives aimed at reforming the Organization to \r\nmake it more effective. The Republic of Moldova \r\nwelcomes the ongoing United Nations reform process, \r\nparticularly regarding Security Council reform. Too \r\noften, that principal body has been criticized for its \r\nfailure to maintain international peace and security. \r\nIt is therefore essential to make it more efficient in \r\ndischarging its primary responsibilities.\r\nIn our view, efficiency can be achieved by \r\nimproving the Council’s representativeness, legitimacy, \r\ntransparency and accountability, as well as by \r\nrestricting the right of veto on issues of substance, as \r\nprovided for by the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nexpect the members of the Security Council, especially \r\nthe permanent members, not only to react but to act \r\npreventively, promptly and impartially whenever \r\npeace and security are threatened, the principles of \r\ninternational law are disregarded or the sovereignty and \r\nintegrity of the States Members of the United Nations \r\nare blatantly violated.\r\nUnder the provisions of Chapter VIII of the Charter, \r\ncertain regional organizations have been entrusted \r\nby the United Nations with dealing with a number of \r\nconflicts that are not a principal focus of the Council’s \r\nwork. In our view, more systematic outreach to these \r\nregional organizations is needed. Steps should also be \r\ntaken to increase their accountability, particularly in \r\nthe case of protracted conflicts, when the situation is \r\nnot improving or is even worsening over the years.\r\nLack of progress should prompt more direct \r\ninvolvement from the appropriate United Nations \r\nbodies. We believe that no conflict falls outside the \r\npurview of the United Nations, regardless of whether \r\nit is on the Security Council’s agenda or not. In \r\nthis context, we welcome the high-level event on \r\nstrengthening the capabilities of the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) as a \r\nChapter VIII organization, organized by the OSCE \r\nChairman-in-Office, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, at the \r\nmargins of the seventy-first session of the General \r\nAssembly, which allowed the participants to discuss \r\nissues relevant to the aforementioned considerations.\r\nAccordingly, we appreciate the fact that the \r\nGeneral Assembly agreed to include in its agenda \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 29/58\r\nitem 32, “Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area and \r\ntheir implications for international peace, security and \r\ndevelopment”. These unresolved conflicts — some, \r\nlike the one in the Republic of Moldova, date back \r\n25 years  — continue to have a negative impact on \r\nthe political, social and economic development of \r\nthe GUAM States. The General Assembly’s debates \r\nunder this item do not, as some fear, undermine the \r\nexisting mechanism to negotiate the settlement of these \r\nconflicts. On the contrary, the ongoing monitoring \r\nof the situation in the areas in question, along with \r\na proactive approach by the United Nations, when \r\nnecessary, can effectively address attempts aimed at \r\nchanging the political borders of some GUAM States \r\nthrough methods that run counter to democracy and \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe Transnistrian conflict that the Republic \r\nof Moldova has endured for many years is, first and \r\nforemost, a product of the long-standing geopolitical \r\ninterests associated with our region. External factors \r\nplayed a decisive role in igniting this conflict in the \r\nearly 1990s. It was triggered shortly after the Republic \r\nof Moldova declared independence, on the very day \r\nour country was granted United Nations membership, \r\n2 March 1992. Unlike other internal conflicts that \r\nare generated and fostered by ethnic and religious \r\nantagonisms, the Transnistrian conflict has a purely \r\ngeopolitical character. In theory, that feature of the \r\nconflict makes it easier to resolve and therefore \r\nstrengthens our conviction that it can be resolved \r\nthrough the resolute joint political efforts of all the \r\nparties involved.\r\nThe similar ethnic composition of the populations \r\nliving on both sides of the Nistru river and their mutual \r\nlack of hatred or intolerance towards one another \r\nspeak for themselves and illustrate both the artificial \r\ncharacter of the Transnistrian entity and the falsity \r\nof its ideological and political tenets. The recurrent \r\ndeclarations by the exponents of the Transnistrian \r\nregime on the need to make the territory it controls a \r\npart of another country, with no common borders with \r\nMoldova, are not only unrealistic but also seriously \r\nundermine the settlement process.\r\nDespite the many difficulties encountered in \r\nthe settlement process, the Moldovan authorities \r\nare determined to find a political solution to the \r\nTransnistrian conflict, using the 5+2 negotiating format \r\nand based on respect for the sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity of the Republic of Moldova, by way of \r\ngranting special legal status to the Transnistrian region. \r\nWe are firmly convinced that the only way to reach this \r\ngoal is through negotiations. However, negotiations can \r\nsucceed only if all the stakeholders show the needed \r\npolitical will, act in good faith and refrain from putting \r\nforward rigid preconditions in negotiating the political \r\naspects of the settlement.\r\nWhat is the right path to final settlement? We \r\nbelieve that the joint and resolute actions of all parties \r\nto the 5+2 settlement format on the basis of a common \r\nagenda and common objectives are what is required, \r\nas are enhanced confidence-building and the bringing \r\ntogether of the people on both banks of the river Nistru \r\nin all spheres of social and economic life. It will also \r\nentail the identification of solutions for topical issues \r\nand the engagement in serious and objective political \r\ndiscussions on the future of the Transnistrian region as \r\nan integral part of the Republic of Moldova. In addition, \r\nit will involve a firm commitment to maintaining \r\nstability and refraining from stoking tensions. \r\nOnly by acting in this way will we be able to stop and \r\nprevent the violation of human rights in the Transnistrian \r\nregion, discourage unilateral destabilization and \r\ngradually create an environment of confidence and \r\ntrust. That is the path the Moldovan authorities will \r\ncontinue to follow, which, hopefully, will deliver the \r\ndesired result — a viable and comprehensive settlement \r\nof the Transnistrian conflict and the reintegration of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova.\r\nWith respect to factors that have a negative impact \r\non the political environment and regional security, I \r\nwould like to reiterate our deep concern over the lack \r\nof progress in the withdrawal of Russian armaments \r\nand troops stationed on our territory without the prior \r\nconsent of the Moldovan authorities, contrary to the \r\nprovisions of the our Constitution. Likewise, we are \r\ndeeply concerned about the increasing frequency of \r\nmilitary exercises involving foreign troops, which \r\nare often conducted jointly with the military and \r\nparamilitary units of the Transnistrian regime.\r\nThe fragile security conditions in our region as a \r\nwhole, amplified by the destabilizing factors in eastern \r\nUkraine, require a constructive re-engagement of all \r\nStates participating in the 5+2 settlement format, as \r\nwell of other relevant or interested actors, particularly \r\nthe OSCE and the United Nations, with a view to \r\nidentifying as swiftly as possible responses and solutions \r\nfor these long-standing problems, in conformity with \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n30/58 16-29667\r\nthe international law. We expect the General Assembly \r\nto focus constructively on the Transnistrian and other \r\nprotracted conflicts, particularly when it considers the \r\nannual resolution on cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the OSCE.\r\nThis year, the Republic of Moldova is celebrating \r\nthe twenty-fifth anniversary of its independence. In that \r\ntime, we have achieved many but not all of the objectives \r\nthat we set for ourselves. We have nevertheless laid the \r\nfoundations for a democratic society, based on European \r\npolitical, economic and social values. We are fully \r\ncommitted to the idea of European integration, which \r\nhas become our national project, and our journey on \r\nthat path is being guided by the Association Agreement \r\nwe concluded with the European Union. The Republic \r\nof Moldova is currently in a period of transition, during \r\nwhich our main priorities are the reforms that should \r\nfacilitate our country’s modernization and enhance \r\nits institutions. The Government that I am privileged \r\nto lead is determined to finalize ongoing, meaningful \r\nreforms and will rely on the support of external partners \r\nin that critical endeavour.\r\nDuring the past 25 years as a State Member of \r\nthe United Nations, Moldova has shared the common \r\nvalues, responsibilities, achievements and setbacks of \r\nthe Organizations. On this occasion, I would like to \r\nreiterate the Republic of Moldova’s commitment to the \r\nUnited Nations and its strong desire to cooperate with \r\nall States Members of the United Nations with a view to \r\nfulfilling the noble purposes and principles enshrined \r\nin the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State of \r\nSamoa\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State of Samoa.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nthe Independent State of Samoa, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nthe Independent State of Samoa, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): The General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session holds special significance for \r\nSamoa and the Pacific region. At the helm of the General \r\nAssembly for the first time ever is a Pacific Islander and \r\ndiplomat from Fiji, His Excellency Ambassador Peter \r\nThomson. The Pacific is often considered a region of \r\npeace and tranquillity, but such credit belies the diverse \r\nand enormous challenges that we face daily, as a group \r\nand as island States. The focus of your presidency, Sir, \r\non the collective implementation of all the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) is therefore a timely and \r\nfitting catalyst to help transform our region’s numerous \r\nchallenges into real and lasting opportunities. Samoa \r\ncongratulates you on your election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and lends its full support to the \r\nagenda that will guide our work during your tenure.\r\nThis general debate is the Secretary-General’s final \r\none before he steps down after a decade of service to \r\nthe cause of humankind. From Samoa’s perspective, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon has been, and continues to be, a true \r\nchampion of and persistent advocate for issues that are \r\nof immense significance to small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS). His passionate leadership on climate \r\nchange — the undisputed priority concern of every \r\nPacific island country and territory — has endeared \r\nhim to the Pacific region. Equally memorable is the \r\nrare distinction he holds as the only Secretary-General \r\nin the 71-year history of the United Nations who has \r\never visited the Pacific region twice during his term \r\nof office. That is no mean feat, given the constraints of \r\nisolation and travel.\r\nIn September 2011, the Secretary-General attended \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum Leaders summit in New \r\nZealand, visiting Solomon Islands and Kiribati along \r\nthe way. There he witnessed at first hand both the scars \r\nand excessive damage to the physical landscape and \r\ncoastlines caused by climate change, on the one hand, \r\nand, on the other, the resilience and sheer determination \r\nof Pacific peoples on the front lines of climate change \r\nto ensure the survival of some of the islands and their \r\ncontinued existence as sovereign nations.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 31/58\r\nLater, in 2014, Samoa’s isolation and lack of political \r\nclout in the global arena were bridged when Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, together with the entire Chief Executive \r\nBoard, visited to attend the United Nations Conference \r\non Small Island Developing States hosted by Samoa on \r\nbehalf of the Pacific region. On his arrival Mr. Ban was \r\nwelcomed as “His Excellency the Secretary-General of \r\nthe United Nations”. A few days later on his departure, \r\nhe was fondly bid farewell as “Afioga Tupua Ban \r\nKi-moon”, after he was conferred the princely title \r\nof Tupua. Such events are now a memorable part of \r\nour history. The close rapport between the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and our region was further evidenced this \r\nmorning when Pacific leaders met with him as part of \r\nour yearly meetings in New York — a much-anticipated \r\nevent, which has become an annual feature of our \r\nSeptember calendar.\r\nI would like to add that as this chapter in the \r\nSecretary-General’s and Samoan chief’s life of service \r\nto multilateralism draws to a close, we thank him for his \r\nprincipled leadership and robust advocacy with regard \r\nto issues that affect and have an impact on our islands \r\nand peoples personally and directly. We wish him well \r\nin his future calling and trust that his successor will \r\nembrace and continue his legacy, especially in the \r\ncontext of climate change and the much anticipated \r\nParis Agreement, which is about to enter into force. \r\nShould he find that prospects are hard to come by, \r\nhe should remember that he has the Tupua dominion \r\nin Samoa.\r\nLast year, we agreed on a number of global \r\nagendas, outcomes and agreements. They represent \r\nour hopes for solutions to address the issues before \r\nour Assembly, ranging from sustainable development \r\nto climate change, from disaster-risk resilience \r\nto development financing and from humanitarian \r\nchallenges to peace and security. Collectively, they \r\nrepresent the totality of our needs and priorities, \r\nincluding the means to achieve them. Every issue is \r\nimportant and all are interconnected. None should \r\nbe considered to be subordinate to any another, to be \r\nmarginalized, abandoned or sidelined. They deserve to \r\nbe implemented through an all-inclusive approach to \r\nensure that they will be addressed and treated equally. \r\nOnly then can one say with some level of comfort that, \r\nin the implementation of our new sustainable agenda, \r\nno one will be left behind. \r\nThat is the backdrop and the reality against which \r\nthe world is anxiously awaiting the selection of Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon’s successor in the task of steering the United \r\nNations during the critical implementation phase of our \r\ninspirational goals. It is a mammoth task, but not an \r\nimpossible one.\r\nAs the search for a new Secretary-General is \r\ngaining momentum, an appointment appears imminent. \r\nYet in this all-important process, Samoa, like others, \r\nis largely a bystander and an observer — not by \r\nchoice, but by design. Like the majority of Member \r\nStates, Samoa hopes that the current selection practice \r\nwill be reformed soon to give the wider membership \r\na more active role in selecting who the head of their \r\nOrganization should be. We can only hope for the \r\ninstitutionalization of best practices.\r\nSamoa expects the new Secretary-General to be \r\nindependent and not beholden to the priorities and \r\ninfluences of those who will sanction the appointment. \r\nThe Secretary-General should treat each and every \r\nMember State equally and accord the same level of \r\nattention and priority to their issues and concerns, \r\nregardless of their size, political influence or economic \r\nmight. We look forward to welcoming and working \r\nclosely with the new appointee. We are confident that \r\nnew leadership will usher in a spring of hope that will \r\nprovide a tailored and fit-for-purpose Secretariat for the \r\nchallenging task at hand. Only in true partnership can \r\nMember States and the Secretariat work in concert to \r\naccelerate the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nWe are greatly encouraged by the demonstrable \r\ncommitment and political will to transform the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change into reality and that it \r\nis poised to enter into force sometime soon. That is a \r\nwelcome and positive development, especially from \r\nthe perspective of all island nations, given the extent \r\nto which impacts of climate change are already being \r\nfelt. When cyclones and natural disasters are happening \r\nmore frequently and with greater intensity in our part \r\nof the world, as witnessed recently in Vanuatu and \r\nFiji, the early entry into force of the Paris Agreement \r\nis everyone’s top priority. As vulnerable small island \r\ndeveloping States, we cannot afford to lose the hard-\r\nearned gains of many years. We applaud the leadership \r\nshown by Member States that have ratified the Paris \r\nAgreement  or pledged to do so soon so that it can enter \r\ninto force in record time.\r\nThe science of climate change is quite clear and \r\nunequivocal. The political will to accelerate the early \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n32/58 16-29667\r\noperationalization of the Paris Agreement is now evident. \r\nBut signing and ratifying the climate agreement are the \r\neasy and early achievables. Delivering on promises \r\nand making good on commitments and undertakings \r\npledged are the seal of true leadership. We need to \r\nmatch the political will with the provision of adequate \r\nresources that are easily accessible so that the climate \r\npledges already submitted to the United Nations can be \r\nused to facilitate early implementation of all efforts to \r\nreduce greenhouse-gas emissions without delay.\r\nThe coordinated management and utilization of the \r\nGlobal Environment Facility, the Adaptation Fund and \r\nthe newly established Green Climate Fund, as well as \r\nthe complementarity offered by other funding sources, \r\nboth private and public, will become all the more \r\ncritical in the implementation phase. The challenge \r\nhas been raised for the Green Climate Fund and other \r\nfunding institutions to assist small island developing \r\nStates in accessing resources through a streamlined \r\nand simplified project cycle and approval process.\r\nAddressing climate change is everyone’s \r\nresponsibility, not a monopoly reserved solely for \r\nGovernments. In 2015, we boldly declared a shared \r\ncommitment to stronger global efforts to ensure that all \r\npeople have a right to live in dignity, free from want and \r\nfear. The Sustainable Development Goals were not just \r\nvisionary goals or mere aspirations; they are designed \r\nto provide for basic human needs of all people in an \r\nachievable manner within our lifetime. Our optimism \r\nwas rooted in a culture of shared responsibility and a \r\nbelief in humankind. Achieving the SDGs will not be \r\neasy without the support of our development partners. \r\nSustainable development requires sustained efforts and \r\ncommitment. Partnerships with the donor community \r\nrequire mutual trust and understanding.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda integrating the three pillars of \r\nsustainable development is not just a preferable option: \r\nit is the only option. Samoa volunteered to report on \r\nits implementation of the new global agenda during \r\nthis year’s high-level political forum on sustainable \r\ndevelopment, less than a year after the Agenda was \r\nadopted. In addition to offering to share its experience \r\nwith the wider United Nations membership, Samoa was \r\nalso eager to benefit and learn from the experiences of \r\nthe other 21 States that were reviewed.\r\nThe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action \r\nPathway is an integral part of our wider 2030 Agenda. \r\nIt represents a dedicated road map for SIDS to make \r\nthe transition from the Millennium Development Goals \r\nto the SDGs and for the eventual achievement of the \r\n17 new Goals. Our new Agenda highlights partnerships \r\nas an important part of Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 17; indeed, partnerships are the very means of \r\nimplementation. With the SIDS Partnership Framework \r\nalready launched, it is important that all SIDS \r\ndevelopment partners and United Nations agencies \r\nare actively and constructively engaged and that the \r\nplatform continues to be supported, monitored and \r\nreported on regularly.\r\nDifferent partnership modalities will be forged \r\nfrom time to time, depending on SIDS priorities. There \r\ncan be the traditional North-South cooperation, the \r\nemerging South-South cooperation, the well-tested \r\ntriangular cooperation or even the novel SIDS-SIDS \r\npartnerships. Importantly, every partnership matters. \r\nWhen one belongs to the United Nations group with \r\nspecial challenges and vulnerabilities in the context of \r\nsustainable development, all options should be open \r\nfor consideration. The SIDS Partnership Framework \r\nand the Steering Committee provide the platform from \r\nwhich new partnerships will emerge through outreach \r\ninitiatives and coordination to ensure that all partners \r\ninvolved work together cooperatively and in a cohesive \r\nmanner to meet SIDS development needs.\r\nOceans and seas have a fundamental role to play \r\nin contributing to global prosperity, from regulating \r\nclimate to providing food security for billions of \r\npeople. They are an important source of employment \r\nand income for many communities around the world. \r\nThe sustainable management of oceans and seas is \r\ntherefore critical for economic and social development \r\nand poverty eradication and for raising living \r\nstandards worldwide.\r\nYet the health of the oceans is increasingly \r\ncompromised by the pressures of overfishing, climate \r\nchange, ocean acidification, habitat loss and pollution. \r\nAs the health of the marine ecosystems declines, so too \r\ndoes their capacity to provide food, livelihoods and \r\nincomes. These impacts disproportionately affect our \r\nisland countries, which are the most vulnerable and \r\nleast able to adapt. And if the trends continue, critical \r\nthresholds may soon be reached, with potentially dire \r\nconsequences for our islands’ food security, incomes \r\nand livelihoods.\r\nIt was against the backdrop of mounting challenges \r\nand a sense of pessimism in the light of the fragmentation \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 33/58\r\nof United Nations discussions on ocean issues that the \r\nPacific small island developing States championed the \r\npush for oceans to be a stand-alone goal in the new set \r\nof Sustainable Development Goals. SDG 14 is now the \r\ndedicated Goal on oceans. Last week’s third Our Ocean \r\nconference, hosted by the United States Government \r\nand under the leadership of Secretary of State John \r\nKerry, and the high-level United Nations Conference \r\nto Support the Implementation of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14, to be held in June 2017, are \r\nwelcome efforts at the global level to address some of \r\nour emerging concerns. The start of the preparatory \r\nprocess to develop an international, legally binding \r\ninstrument under the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea on issues relating to the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction is a positive \r\ndevelopment — a step in the right direction — in which \r\nthe Pacific islands are participating very actively.\r\nThe world is a powerless witness to the tragedy of \r\npeople f leeing from their countries to avoid being mired \r\nin the destruction of war and terrorism. Obviously, a \r\ncredible and long-term response is needed to address \r\nthis grave crisis that has cost so many innocent lives and \r\naffected so many people. Individual actions by States \r\ncannot in themselves lead to a solution. We must all \r\nshoulder the responsibility of collectively meeting the \r\nthreat through concerted multilateral action, consistent \r\nwith the spirit that underlies the Organization. Ideally, \r\nthis effort must start in the Security Council, which is \r\nentrusted with the responsibility of maintaining world \r\npeace.\r\nIt is in that conviction that Samoa calls on the \r\nSecurity Council to address the threat posed by the \r\nrecent actions of North Korea to the peace and stability \r\nof the Asia and Pacific region, if not the whole world. \r\nImagine how easily achievable some if not all of the 17 \r\nSDGs would be if all the resources spent on futile wars \r\nwere instead diverted for the much-needed economic \r\nand social activities that are so necessary for the \r\ncreation of a peaceful society.\r\nOur world has enjoyed peace and security for \r\n70 years by faithfully observing and following the \r\nCharter of our Organization. World leaders with the \r\npower and authority to end wars have the moral duty \r\nand responsibility to ensure that our people continue \r\nto live in peace and harmony for many more years to \r\ncome. In their reflective wisdom, our leaders have \r\nreaffirmed their faith in a strengthened and reformed \r\nUnited Nations as a vital multilateral institution that \r\ncan respond effectively and ably to the challenges of \r\nthe twenty-first century and deliver on the Millennium \r\nDeclaration.\r\nSamoa supports an enlarged Security Council in \r\nboth membership categories to reflect contemporary \r\ngeopolitical realities. The case for democratic practices \r\nand transparency in the Security Council’s procedures \r\nand working methods in order to facilitate a more \r\nengaged and effective relationship with the General \r\nAssembly remains a compelling one. On the other hand, \r\nthe Assembly must work hard to regain the confidence \r\nof the world in its status as the highest representative \r\ndecision-making body of the Organization.\r\nLet me now pay homage to the self less work \r\nperformed by the men and women in the Blue Helmets \r\nserving in various peacekeeping operations, some of \r\nwhom have paid the ultimate sacrifice. Samoa will \r\ncontinue to provide civilian policemen and policewomen \r\nas its tangible contribution to such a noble cause.\r\nMr. Braun (Germany), Vice-President, took the \r\nChair.\r\nLet us remember that the strength of our \r\nOrganization lies in our numbers and our diverse \r\nmembership. We must rise above the confines of \r\nnational interests and work to benefit from the diverse \r\nrichness of our membership. Let us capitalize on our \r\nunity in diversity and set aside our differences so that, \r\nas nations united, we can be the vanguard for the good \r\nof humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Belgium\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium.\r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n34/58 16-29667\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Charles Michel, Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Belgium, and inviting him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): “None \r\nof us acting alone can achieve success.” These are the \r\nwords of Nelson Mandela. We must decide and act \r\ntogether because only together can we come up with \r\nright responses to the many challenges that we face. \r\nOur responsibility is to offer every child — boy or \r\ngirl — the keys to his or her own emancipation. Every \r\nman, every woman, wherever they are born, bears \r\nuniversal rights. They must be able to learn, to work, to \r\ncare for themselves and to raise their children in peace \r\nand security. Technological, medical and social progress \r\nmust be shared. It must not belong to a privileged few. \r\nThat must be our commitment and our common goal.\r\nWe know the path by which we can reach such a \r\ngoal. It has been embodied since 1948 in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights. The universal values \r\nare a beacon that must shed an immutable light on the \r\npath of humankind. There should be no exception, no \r\ncompromise and no renouncement of the respect for \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and democracy. \r\nAnd yet, let us look at the truth. Equality between \r\nwomen and man is not always a fact of life. Freedom \r\nof expression and freedom of the press are too often \r\nf louted. Homophobia, in some countries, has even \r\nbeen legalized, sometimes even through recent laws. In \r\naddition, too often, the rule of law is a smokescreen \r\nand justice is not a remedy but a threat to citizens and \r\nbusinesses.\r\nThe African continent overflows with strengths \r\nand talents. Its potential is immense. The histories \r\nof Europe and Africa are intrinsically linked and, of \r\ncourse, we share a future. It is vital that we all mobilize \r\nto encourage and support Africa’s development, first of \r\nall, through more fairly apportioned economic growth \r\nand the emergence of a middle class. I support the \r\ncreation of a genuinely equal, win-win partnership with \r\nAfrica, based neither on nostalgia or guilt.\r\nI firmly believe, as history has always shown, \r\nthat strengthened democratic rights and personal \r\nfreedoms always go hand in hand with development \r\nand the improvement of people’s living conditions. In \r\nthe past few years, Africa has seen several successful \r\ndemocratic transitions, due above all to those citizens \r\nwho have participated in their political and electoral \r\nprocesses and thereby solidified their democratic \r\ninstitutions and sovereignty.\r\nUnfortunately, some citizens are still too often \r\ndeprived of the fundamental right to elect those who \r\nare supposed to represent them. In the words of John \r\nF. Kennedy, “Those who make peaceful revolution \r\nimpossible will make violent revolution inevitable.” An \r\nhonest election is a peaceful revolution, because the \r\nonly legitimate Government is an elected one. Respect \r\nfor the requirements of the rule of law, and therefore \r\nof a country’s constitution, is the only possible way to \r\nensure stability and democratic harmony. The people \r\nof Burundi have been denied that right, resulting in \r\ndiscord, division and even oppression. The only solution \r\nto that crisis is a genuinely inclusive inter-Burundian \r\ndialogue conducted under international mediation and \r\nin accordance with the Arusha Peace Agreement.\r\nIt is crucial that elections be held in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and all doubts surrounding \r\nthem removed. I firmly condemn all the violence that \r\nwe have witnessed there, including in the past few \r\ndays in Kinshasa. Those who exercise authority must \r\nassume their full and individual share of responsibility. \r\nI want to be very clear here. We respect the principles \r\nof sovereignty and independence, but on the condition \r\nthat sovereignty does not become a smokescreen for \r\nabusing the rule of law and violating fundamental \r\nfreedoms. I appeal to the country’s political leaders \r\nboth in the majority and the opposition to avoid an \r\nescalation. There should be a broad, inclusive dialogue. \r\nThey should be equal to their country and people. They \r\nshould not hide their faces. The only path to stability is \r\nby establishing, as soon as possible, a definite date for \r\nholding honest, credible elections.\r\nAt this point, we must admit that the situation in Syria \r\nconstitutes a continuing failure for the international \r\ncommunity. It is a country torn apart by unspeakable \r\nsuffering, where massive numbers of refugees have \r\nbeen uprooted from their homes. We cannot accept \r\nthe notion that the chaos in Syria serves the long-term \r\ngeostrategic interests of Syrians, or their future. We \r\ncannot accept that one man’s bloody obduracy stands \r\nin the way of a political solution and peace. We support \r\nSpecial Envoy Staffan de Mistura and urge all the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council to show \r\nthat they have a sense of responsibility. We would also \r\nlike to remind them that there can be no impunity for \r\nviolations of international humanitarian law.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 35/58\r\nWith Da’esh, as with Al-Qaida, Boko Haram and \r\nAl-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, what we are dealing \r\nwith is in fact a new totalitarianism. At question are \r\nfanaticism and the negation of human life itself. They \r\nwant to destroy freedom. They have chosen the path \r\nof barbarism and terror. Like many others, my country \r\nsuffered a tragic blow from them, last March. The \r\nfight we must wage against terrorism must be a shared \r\none, uncompromising and intransigent. Naturally, \r\nwe support the Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to \r\nPrevent Violent Extremism (A/70/674). But we must \r\ndo more and better, systematizing our exchanges of \r\ninformation and intelligence in order to anticipate and \r\nprevent such barbaric acts. Freedom must be stronger \r\nthan the shadows.\r\nAround the world, there are 65 million women and \r\nmen who are either refugees or displaced. Countries \r\nsuch as Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey are on the front \r\nlines as hosts to huge numbers of refugees, with all the \r\ndifficulties that entails. Every continent is involved, \r\nand we know what the causes are: war, poverty, climate \r\nchange. Needless to say, peace and development are \r\nthe best responses we can make, and we must also \r\nensure the dignity of every human being, with special \r\nconcern for those who are most vulnerable — women \r\nand children.\r\nPolitical dialogue and international negotiations \r\nare tedious processes, too often slow and strewn with \r\nobstacles, with as many steps backward as forward.\r\nThat often results in frustration and sometimes even a \r\nfeeling of powerlessness. And yet I believe firmly that \r\ninclusive, stubborn, tenacious political dialogue is the \r\nsurest way to finding lasting solutions. And we should \r\nalso highlight international diplomacy’s successes. The \r\npeace agreement between the Colombian authorities \r\nand the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, \r\nthe formation of a Government in Libya, the nuclear \r\nagreement with Iran, the diplomatic rapprochement \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States and the fight \r\nagainst Ebola are all examples of progress and success, \r\nholding a key to a better and safer life for millions.\r\nHow true is the saying, often attributed to Nelson \r\nMandela, that a winner is a dreamer who never gives \r\nup. I too believe that courage and tenacity are key to \r\nadvancing peace and ensuring a more secure, more just \r\nworld. We should never lose hope or abandon ourselves \r\nto fatalism. \r\nThe situation in Israel and Palestine today is yet \r\nanother illustration of the urgency and importance \r\nof reviving the political process in order to arrive \r\nat a definitive solution to the conflict. We support a \r\ntwo-State solution, but in the current circumstances, \r\nif no fundamental change is made, we know that this \r\nprospect may be irretrievably lost.\r\nWe should put a stop to the acts that hinder such \r\na solution. We condemn the continued settlement \r\nactivities in the occupied territories. At the same \r\ntime, we are firmly committed to maintaining Israel’s \r\nsecurity, which must be guaranteed. We support \r\nFrance’s initiative aimed at facilitating the resumption \r\nof talks. In another essential step, the Palestinians must \r\nalso advance their own dialogue.\r\nInternational law cannot be reduced to the law of \r\nthe jungle. On the frontiers of Europe, the territorial \r\nintegrity of several countries has been violated by one \r\ncountry alone. It is not acceptable to fan the f lames \r\nof conflict in order to soothe nostalgic feelings of \r\ngrandeur. I urge that we work to find a way out of this \r\nlogic of confrontation with Russia. We have too many \r\ninterests in common to allow ourselves the luxury of \r\ndiplomatic paralysis.\r\nIn the past few years we have made a lot of progress \r\nin reducing poverty and improving access to basic \r\nhealth care. But we know very well that there is still so \r\nmuch to do. The Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change have given us \r\na proactive framework to continue making progress, \r\nand we should strive unstintingly to implement them. It \r\nis our duty to future generations to create a safer world \r\nthat is more respectful of our planet.\r\nEconomic exchanges and international trade \r\ncontribute to worldwide growth and employment. Free \r\nenterprise, the private finance initiative and economic \r\nexchanges are the foundations of development: they \r\nfuel research, technological innovation and even \r\nmedical progress. We must promote transparency in \r\nthe fiscal and banking sectors and fight all forms of \r\ncorruption. Capitalism is not naturally virtuous: just \r\nand transparent rules are necessary. However, in many \r\ncountries employees are not properly compensated for \r\ntheir work. Capitalism is not an end in itself, but an \r\ninstrument that we must put to use at the service of \r\nhuman development: no more, no less.\r\nThe global economic situation is constricting \r\nState budgets. Work is often too heavily taxed in \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n36/58 16-29667\r\ncomparison to other sources of revenue. For that \r\nreason, Belgium, along with 10 other countries of the \r\nEuropean Union, would like to develop a system to tax \r\nfinancial transactions. We must succeed in removing \r\nthe technical and political obstacles. It is a question of \r\nelementary equity.\r\nIt is an honour for my country to defend the \r\nuniversal principles and values of liberty, tolerance and \r\ndialogue. We fully respect the traditions, cultures and \r\nidentities of the various peoples of the world, and we \r\nbelieve that universal values are the shared foundation \r\nof a fairer and safer world. We believe in the virtues of \r\nmultilateralism and the persistent search for consensus \r\nthrough political dialogue.\r\nBelgium is an active, stable and loyal member of \r\nthe international community. For that reason, we are \r\na candidate for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for the 2019-2020 period. I sincerely hope \r\nthat we can count on the support of a large number of \r\ncountries in that election.\r\nI also wish to extend my gratitude to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his commitment to peace \r\nand security. His intelligence and creativity have meant \r\nthat he leaves behind a solid legacy. I already have high \r\nhopes for his successor, who will, we hope, ensure the \r\nproper implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nA politician concerns himself with the next \r\nelection, whereas a statesman concerns himself with \r\nthe future of the next generation. Let us strive to meet \r\nthe expectations of our citizens, fulfil our universal \r\nvalues and act as statesmen.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Belgium for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Anerood Jugnauth, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister of Defence and Home \r\nAffairs, Minister of Rodrigues and National \r\nDevelopment Unit of the Republic of Mauritius\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\na statement by the Prime Minister, Minister of Defence \r\nand Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues and National \r\nDevelopment Unit of the Republic of Mauritius.\r\nMr. Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nDefence and Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues \r\nand National Development Unit of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Anerood Jugnauth, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister of Defence and Home Affairs, \r\nMinister of Rodrigues and National Development \r\nUnit of the Republic of Mauritius, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Jugnauth (Mauritius): It pleases me at the \r\noutset to convey my heartfelt congratulations to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession. I also seize this opportunity to extend my \r\nsincere gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his exemplary stewardship of the Organization as \r\nSecretary-General throughout the past decade. As he \r\nleaves office at the end of this year, I wish him the very \r\nbest in his future endeavours. He will be remembered \r\nfor the rich legacy that he is leaving behind.\r\nLast year, the Assembly adopted the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, setting new benchmarks \r\nthat will shape our future. We acknowledged the \r\nimportance of every Goal, every target and every \r\nindicator as steps towards a better world. Our collective \r\nresponse and our solidarity in the face of the challenges \r\nthat will arise as we try to carve out a sustainable world \r\nwill determine whether we succeed in achieving the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Each country \r\nhas its priorities and will need to formulate a unique set \r\nof actions in order to achieve the universal goals that \r\nwe have set for ourselves.\r\nIn that context, the United Nations will have an \r\nimportant role to play in supporting the efforts of \r\nindividual countries. In Mauritius, we have chosen \r\nto focus our attention primarily on the eradication of \r\nextreme forms of poverty. My Government, with the \r\nsupport of the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nhas already undertaken to establish a social register \r\nof those living in dismal conditions and who require \r\ntargeted measures and assistance.\r\nAs a first unprecedented measure, we have \r\nintroduced in this year’s national budget a subsistence \r\nallowance for the extreme poor based on a threshold \r\nof 2,720 Mauritian rupees per adult. That threshold is \r\n40 per cent higher than the World Bank International \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 37/58\r\nExtreme Poverty Line of of $3.10 per day per individual, \r\ncalculated on the basis of purchasing power parity.\r\nThere are yet many miles to go, and we will \r\nresolutely pursue our journey towards attaining all of \r\nthe SDGs by working together with the private sector \r\nand civil society. We are fully committed to creating \r\na more equitable system, to safeguarding rule of law \r\nand to ensuring equal access to justice for all, as \r\nencapsulated in Goal 16 on peace and justice. The \r\nUnited Nations will be tested in the effort to achieve \r\nGoal 16 on an international scale, for we are conscious \r\nof the power of ‘Might against right’. Nevertheless, \r\nMauritius will persevere in its fight for the vulnerable.\r\nFor a small island developing State like ours, \r\nGoal 13 on climate action and Goal 14 on the oceans \r\nare of paramount importance for our survival. We are \r\npleased that we have now crossed the first threshold \r\nfor the entry into force of the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. The 60 countries that have ratified the \r\nAgreement are responsible for 47.76 per cent of global \r\nemissions. For small island developing States (SIDS), \r\nthe early entry into force of the Paris Agreement is of \r\nparamount importance.\r\nThe tourism industry in SIDS faces particular \r\nchallenges owing to the negative effects of global \r\nwarming. Taking measures to reverse that trend is \r\nessential to us in order to preserve marine and coastal \r\necosystems and biodiversity, and to foster the clean and \r\nsustainable use of our oceans. Mauritius will ensure \r\nthat the steps it takes to advance its ocean economy are \r\nin synergy with sustainability principles.\r\nIn that context, I am pleased to inform the \r\nAssembly that on 1 and 2 September Mauritius, with \r\nthe support of the World Bank, hosted the African \r\nMinisterial Conference on Ocean Economies and \r\nClimate Change. The Mauritius Communiqué, which \r\nencapsulates the outcome of the Conference, will serve \r\nas an input for the Green Climate Fund Africa Dialogue \r\nto be held next month in Cape Town. Mauritius will \r\nalso contribute to the discussions at the African Union \r\nExtraordinary Summit on Maritime Security and Safety \r\nand Development in Africa, scheduled for 15 October in \r\nTogo, and at the Conference of the Parties to the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nfrom 7 to 18 November, in Morocco.\r\nLet me highlight the fact that during the Conference \r\nin Mauritius, African Ministers, along with our \r\ndevelopment partners — in particular the World Bank \r\nGroup, the African Development Bank and the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations —\r\nagreed that a technical and financial assistance package \r\nis imperative in order to support ocean economies and \r\nensure the resilience of oceans and coastal areas to \r\nclimate change. We look forward to the adoption of \r\nsuch a package at the Climate Change Conference in \r\nMorocco.\r\nAddressing the causes and effects of climate \r\nchange will require robust determination and strong \r\npolitical will, as well as extraordinary means, in terms \r\nof both financing and technology transfer. We highly \r\nappreciate the pledges made by countries such as \r\nFrance and Canada to provide financing to fight climate \r\nchange. However, access to those resources needs to be \r\nsimplified and needs to take into account the specific \r\ncircumstances of individual countries.\r\nTwo days ago, Mauritius and the Commonwealth \r\nSecretariat signed a host country agreement for the \r\nestablishment in Mauritius of a Climate Finance Access \r\nHub, as had been decided at the Commonwealth Heads \r\nof Government Meeting held in Malta in November \r\n2015. The Hub will help small island developing States \r\nand least developed countries to unlock critical climate \r\nfunds.\r\nAll our efforts to make our planet sustainable and \r\nto leave a proud legacy for future generations will be \r\nin vain if we are unable to maintain peace and security \r\nin the world and if we do not adhere to the invaluable \r\nprinciples of the rule of law and democracy. That is why \r\nMauritius vehemently condemns, without reservation, \r\nthe multiple acts of terrorism and violent extremism in \r\nall their forms.\r\nWe believe that a reformed United Nations, \r\nincluding a comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, is essential to the global capacity to respond \r\neffectively to terrorist threats and new situations. An \r\nenlarged and more representative Security Council will \r\nfurther strengthen the United Nations role in furthering \r\npeace and security and the rule of law across the globe. \r\nMauritius adheres to the African position on the reform \r\nof the Security Council, as elaborated in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus. We believe that the historical injustice done \r\nto Africa with regard to representation on the Council \r\nshould be redressed. We also support a dedicated seat \r\nfor SIDS. In addition, Mauritius fully supports India’s \r\naspiration to a permanent seat. \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n38/58 16-29667\r\nWhile the formal recognition of Palestine by \r\nthe United Nations as an observer is a very positive \r\ndevelopment, we must exert relentless efforts to work \r\ntowards the goal of having two distinct, independent, \r\nsecure and viable States, Palestine and Israel, living \r\npeacefully side by side.\r\nThe firm belief of Mauritius in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and in the legitimacy of a fair and just \r\nmultilateral system is unshakable. Every nation has a \r\nright to peace, justice, the rule of law and democracy, and \r\nevery human being has the right to basic human rights. \r\nThat is the basis on which the Mauritius Constitution \r\nis built. Those are also the principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter. The full realization of those principles will not \r\nbe possible, however, unless complete decolonization is \r\naccomplished.\r\nIt was 48 years ago that my country became a \r\nfree and sovereign nation, an independent country \r\nin the eyes of the world. Yet even today, it is unable \r\nto exercise its sovereignty over parts of its territory, \r\nnamely, the Chagos Archipelago and Tromelin Island. \r\nOn 8 November 1965, prior to granting Mauritius its \r\nindependence on 12 March 1968, the United Kingdom \r\nillegally excised the Chagos Archipelago from the \r\nterritory of Mauritius, purportedly in order to create \r\nthe so-called British Indian Ocean territory. That \r\nexcision was carried out in violation of international \r\nlaw and General Assembly resolutions 1514 (XV) of \r\n14 December 1960, 2066 (XX) of 16 December 1965, \r\n2232 (XXI) of 20 December 1966, and 2357 (XXII) of \r\n19 December 1967.\r\nResolution 1514 (XV) stipulates that any attempt \r\naimed at the partial or total disruption of the national \r\nunity and the territorial integrity of a country is \r\nincompatible with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. It clearly prohibits \r\nthe dismemberment of any colonial territory prior to \r\nindependence. In addition to excising that integral part \r\nof our territory, the Mauritians living in the Chagos \r\nArchipelago were forcibly evicted from their home and \r\nmoved to the main island of Mauritius in total disregard \r\nfor their human rights. The Government of Mauritius \r\nis fully sensitive to their plight and their rightful \r\naspiration to resettle in the Chagos Archipelago, as per \r\ntheir legitimate right as citizens of Mauritius. We are \r\ndetermined to resettle those who were forcibly evicted \r\nfrom the Archipelago upon its return to the effective \r\ncontrol of Mauritius, in full respect of all their rights \r\nand dignity.\r\nMy delegation includes the spokesperson for \r\nMauritians of Chagossian origin. He represents a whole \r\ncommunity whose human rights have been f louted. \r\nHis presence also testifies to the fact that the issue \r\nof sovereignty and the right of return of Mauritian \r\nChagossians to their native lands cannot be dissociated. \r\nMauritius has consistently protested against the \r\nillegal excision of the Chagos Archipelago and has \r\nunequivocally maintained that the Chagos Archipelago, \r\nincluding the island of Diego Garcia, forms an integral \r\npart of its territory, under both Mauritian law and \r\ninternational law. Mauritius has also consistently \r\npressed for the completion of the decolonization \r\nprocess.\r\nFor decades, Mauritius has called on the former \r\ncolonial Power to engage with us in order to find a \r\nfair and just solution, but our efforts have been in vain \r\nso far. Despite the blatant violation of resolution 1514 \r\n(XV), the United Kingdom maintains that its continued \r\npresence in the Chagos Archipelago is lawful. Yet the \r\nUnited Kingdom also tacitly admits the impropriety of \r\nits action in dismembering the territory of Mauritius, \r\nas evidenced by the undertaking which it has given on \r\nvarious occasions that the Chagos Archipelago will \r\nbe returned to Mauritius when no longer required for \r\ndefence purposes.\r\nThat undertaking has been held to be legally \r\nbinding by the arbitral tribunal established in the case \r\nbrought by Mauritius against the United Kingdom under \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\nto challenge the legality of the marine protected area \r\npurportedly established by the United Kingdom around \r\nthe Chagos Archipelago. However, the United Kingdom \r\nhas not honoured that undertaking so far, It keeps \r\nchanging the criteria, which rely on the contention that \r\nthe use of the Chagos Archipelago is still required for \r\ndefence purposes.\r\nThe arbitral tribunal ruled that the creation of the \r\npurported marine protected area around the Chagos \r\nArchipelago by the United Kingdom was in violation \r\nof international law. Two of the arbitrators found that \r\nthe excision of the Chagos Archipelago from Mauritius \r\nin 1965 showed a complete disregard for the territorial \r\nintegrity of Mauritius by the United Kingdom, in \r\nviolation of the right to self determination, and that the \r\nUnited Kingdom is not the coastal State in relation to the \r\nChagos Archipelago. That finding was not contradicted \r\nby the other two members of the arbitral tribunal.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 39/58\r\nThe General Assembly has a direct institutional \r\ninterest in the matter, given the historic and central \r\nrole that it has played in the process of decolonization \r\nthroughout the world. The Assembly has a continuing \r\nresponsibility to complete the process of decolonization, \r\nincluding that of Mauritius. That is why, at the request \r\nof the Government of Mauritius, the General Assembly \r\nhas included in the agenda of its seventy-first session \r\nitem 87, “Request for an advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice on the legal consequences \r\nof the separation of the Chagos Archipelago from \r\nMauritius in 1965”. An advisory opinion would assist \r\nthe Assembly in its work on decolonization in general \r\nand the decolonization of Mauritius in particular, \r\npursuant to the requirements of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law.\r\nI would like to insist on the fact that the decision \r\nto have recourse to that action was not taken with an \r\nadversarial intent. This is not the first time that an \r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice \r\nis being sought on such a subject. In our view, the \r\nprocedure represents a legitimate recourse, and it abides \r\nby the provisions of the Charter and past practice of the \r\nUnited Nations. We have noted that the United Kingdom \r\nhas now expressed the wish to engage in dialogue with \r\nMauritius in order to sort the matter out by June 2017. \r\nMauritius has always believed in true dialogue. We are \r\nacting in good faith, and we expect the same from our \r\ninterlocutors.\r\nWe believe that the Assembly has the duty to \r\nassist in the completion of the decolonization process. \r\nMauritius is of the view that an advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice in respect of the Chagos \r\nArchipelago will undoubtedly assist the Assembly in \r\nthe discharge of that responsibility. I wish to heartily \r\nthank member States of the African Union, the African, \r\nCaribbean and Pacific Group of States, the Non-Aligned \r\nGroup, and the Group of 77 and China, among others, \r\nwhich have openly expressed their support to my \r\ncountry. I know that when it comes to justice, human \r\ndignity and territorial integrity, the Assembly will live \r\nup to its mission. We concur with the position of the \r\nUnited Kingdom on a rule-based international system. \r\nHowever, we have to be coherent, not only in what we \r\nsay, but also in what we do.\r\nThe decolonization of Mauritius will also not be \r\nfully resolved until the issue of Tromelin is settled. We \r\nhave had very constructive dialogue with France, and \r\nwe urge France to pursue that dialogue with Mauritius \r\nfor the early resolution of the dispute over the island in \r\nthe continued spirit of friendship that has characterized \r\nthe relationship between our two countries.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nTerritorial integrity is a principle of international \r\nlaw. The United Nations recognizes it as such, it is \r\ntherefore our duty to ensure that it is respected.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nTo conclude, I would like to call on the entire \r\nmembership of the United Nations to stand by the \r\nright to justice, to show that a better and safer world \r\nis possible only when it is compatible with the rule of \r\nlaw, and to show commitment to the principles of the \r\nCharter.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nof Defence and Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues \r\nand National Development Unit of the Republic of \r\nMauritius for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister, Minister of \r\nDefence and Home Affairs, Minister of Rodrigues \r\nand National Development Unit of the Republic of \r\nMauritius, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on his Excellency \r\nMr. Sergey Lavrov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRussian Federation.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Last year, from this same rostrum, at \r\nthe seventieth anniversary session of the General \r\nAssembly, much was said concerning the critical \r\nturning point in world development. The keynote was \r\nthe recognition that humankind is moving from a \r\nbipolar and monopolar world order towards multipolar \r\nand democratic systems of international relations with \r\nregard to dealing with common challenges and threats, \r\nwhich we can overcome only through joint efforts. \r\nIt was rightly stressed that there is a need to change \r\nthe very philosophy of inter-State communication by \r\navoiding attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of \r\nStates or to impose development models on countries \r\nand peoples.\r\nUnfortunately, despite having acknowledged \r\nthat fact, many Western countries continue to favour \r\ntheir entrenched ideas of mentoring, dominance, \r\nexclusiveness and the realization of self-interests by \r\nany means, rather than promote just and equitable \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n40/58 16-29667\r\ncooperation. We see, in the bloodshed in the Middle East \r\nand North Africa, the consequences of such arrogance \r\nand their sense of infallibility in their pushing forward \r\nunilateral and reckless solutions to complex conflicts. \r\nAs a result, the foundations of world stability are being \r\ndestroyed. It is high time to draw the necessary lessons \r\nand avoid sinking into catastrophe in Syria.\r\nLargely thanks to Russia’s military response and \r\nassistance at the request of the legitimate Government \r\nof Syria, it has been possible to prevent the collapse \r\nof that country’s statehood and the disintegration \r\nof the country under the onslaught of terrorists. Our \r\ninvolvement provided the impetus for the establishment \r\nof the International Syria Support Group, which seeks \r\nto start a meaningful political process so that the \r\nSyrians themselves can determine the future of their \r\ncountry through an inclusive dialogue among all ethnic \r\nand religious groups. That is uncontestable. It has \r\nbeen acknowledged in the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and is enshrined in the recent agreements \r\nbetween Russia and the United States as Co-Chairs \r\nof the International Syria Support Group. We thank \r\neveryone who has supported us in those efforts.\r\nIt is now essential to prevent the collapse of those \r\nagreements and to carry out an unbiased and impartial \r\ninvestigation into the incidents in Deir ez-Zor and \r\nAleppo, which undermine the agreements, especially \r\ngiven that there are quite a few people wishing to \r\nsabotage both the agreements and a settlement of \r\nthe conflict in Syria. It is crucial to comply with the \r\ndemand of the Security Council to separate what is \r\nknown as the moderate opposition from the terrorists. \r\nAnd, in that regard, a particular responsibility lies with \r\nthe United States and the members of the United States-\r\nled coalition.\r\nIf we truly wish to resolve the Syrian crisis \r\nand the appalling humanitarian situation there, the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham, Jabhat al-Nusrah \r\nand associated extremist groups must be suppressed. \r\nThat is key to reaching a cessation of hostilities and \r\nnational reconciliation. Today, it is unpardonable to \r\nput off intra-Syrian negotiations, as well as to impose \r\npreconditions to them. Everything must be done in line \r\nwith Security Council resolution 2254 (2015). \r\nSabotaging the process — in particular through \r\nthe use of external forces, including their advisers and \r\nsupporters — has a negative impact on the reputation \r\nof the United Nations and leads us to believe that the \r\nreason for it lies in an attempt to change the regime.  We \r\nhave seen that sort of zero-sum game in Ukraine, which \r\nis very close to us, in the unconstitutional attempts \r\nto overthrow the Government and now in Ukraine’s \r\nrefusal to fulfil the Minsk Agreement of 12 February \r\n2015. By and large, the attempt to use those conflicts \r\nto achieve self-serving geopolitical goals has been \r\nobvious to everyone.\r\nThe latest meeting of the International Syria \r\nContact Group gives us reason to remain very cautiously \r\noptimistic. More broadly, it is only through the genuine \r\nimplementation of all agreements that we will be able \r\nto have, in the Euro-Atlantic area, equal and indivisible \r\nsecurity for mutually beneficial cooperation, as was \r\nstated at the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe nearly 20 years ago.\r\nNeither NATO nor the European Union will \r\nbe able to replace a truly collective unification \r\nof efforts in the interest of all without losers and \r\nwinners. And it is also utterly unacceptable to hold \r\nathletic competitions — which have always brought \r\npeoples together, strengthening friendship and mutual \r\ntrust — hostage for reasons of political ambition. \r\nAttempts to manipulate the outcome of competitions \r\ndoes not honour those who flaunt their allegiance to fair \r\ncompetition but actually violate the General Assembly \r\nprinciples supporting the independence and autonomy \r\nof sports. \r\nIn today’s world, we cannot be guided by the \r\nphilosophy of the anti-heroes of George Orwell’s \r\ndystopic novel Animal Farm, where all animals are \r\nequal but some are more equal than others. In the \r\nenlightened twenty-first century, it is simply indecent \r\nto adopt the role of mentor to everyone else, reserving \r\nfor oneself the right to use doping in sports, launch \r\nunilateral adventures bypassing the United Nations, \r\nconduct geopolitical experiments that cost millions of \r\nhuman lives, engage in the extraterritorial blackmail of \r\neveryone, including one’s closest allies, while what is \r\nreally intended is to advance one’s own financial profit, \r\nor even to set the criteria for the greatness of a particular \r\ncountry. All of that is unworthy of the principles \r\nof freedom and equality, on the basis of which great \r\nnations have grown and which are now being used by \r\ntheir elites to threaten the entire world.\r\nThis year, we mark the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe Nuremberg Tribunal decisions. The anniversary \r\ncautions us against forgetting the lessons of the \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 41/58\r\nSecond World War and reminds us of the catastrophic \r\nconsequences of attempting to determine the fate of \r\nthe world by suppressing the legitimate interests of \r\nother States and peoples. The freedoms of expression \r\nand peaceful assembly should not be used as a cover \r\nfor condoning radical movements that profess a Nazi \r\nideology and support the glorification of the Nazis \r\nand their accomplices. The persistence of such vicious \r\ninstincts dictates the need for consistent efforts to \r\nplace a solid barrier in the way of neo-Nazism and \r\nrevanchism, strengthen inter-ethnic and intercultural \r\naccord and rally the young generation around the ideas \r\nof justice and equality. We invite everyone to take part \r\nin the nineteenth World Festival of Youth and Students \r\nin Sochi in October 2017.\r\nHegemony has no place in the future, if we want it \r\nto be a just future that gives people the opportunity to \r\nchoose their own ways of development. That entails the \r\nneed to learn to respect one’s partners and respect the \r\ncultural and civilizational diversity of the modern world. \r\nWe must therefore return to our origins — the norms \r\nand principles enshrined in the United Nations Charter \r\nand other instruments of the world Organization. Our \r\ncommitment to that approach was reaffirmed in the \r\nDeclaration of the Russian Federation and the People’s \r\nRepublic of China on the Promotion of International \r\nLaw, signed on 25 June. The observance of the principles \r\nof the sovereign equality of States and non-interference \r\nin their internal affairs should become a measure of the \r\ndecency and legitimacy of any member of the world \r\ncommunity.\r\nWe cannot address the global issues of countering \r\ninternational terrorism, the proliferation of weapons \r\nof mass destruction and other transboundary threats \r\nwithout abandoning the philosophy of exclusiveness \r\nand permissiveness. There should be no place for \r\ndouble standards in fighting terrorism. Truly universal \r\njoint efforts are required to create a broad counter-\r\nterrorist front, as President Putin proposed from this \r\nrostrum last year (see A/70/PV.13). The tragedies in \r\nIraq, Libya, Yemen and Syria have proved the need to \r\nstop opportunistic attempts to use extremists as a way \r\nto advance geopolitical intentions. Before it is too late, \r\nit is necessary to think about the task of preventing the \r\nproliferation of terrorist and extremist ideology, which \r\nliterally holds youth hostage in various regions of the \r\nworld. We are drafting a Security Council resolution \r\naimed at mobilizing efforts to eliminate such evils. We \r\nare looking forward to support for our initiative.\r\nThe elimination of the breeding grounds for \r\nradicalism would be facilitated significantly by \r\nresolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine. It \r\nis important to overcome the  deep deadlock, which is \r\nstipulated in the 1 July 2016 report of the Quartet of \r\nMiddle East facilitators. We call for the implementation \r\nof its recommendations.\r\nWe are also seriously concerned about \r\nnon-proliferation and arms control. There have been \r\nattempts to replace the key objectives of maintaining \r\nstrategic stability in all its components with populist \r\nslogans of “nuclear zero”. We see a number of countries \r\npossessing nuclear arsenals not participating in the \r\nexisting treaties. The fundamental Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons is being put to a \r\nserious test. Its parties find it more difficult to speak a \r\ncommon language, especially in a situation when certain \r\nnuclear Powers torpedo any compromises regarding the \r\nstart of the negotiations on the establishment of a zone \r\nfree of weapons of mass destruction and their means of \r\ndelivery in the Middle East.\r\nRussia has consistently supported the liberation \r\nof humankind from the threat of nuclear weapons and \r\nother types of weapons of mass destruction. However, \r\nprogress towards nuclear disarmament must be made \r\nin the context of the full consideration of a whole set \r\nof factors that affect strategic stability, including the \r\nimpact of unilateral global missile defence systems, the \r\ndevelopment of strategic non-nuclear strike weapons, \r\nthe threat of the placement of weapons in outer \r\nspace, the inability to ensure the entry into force of \r\nthe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, and the \r\ngrowing imbalance in conventional arms in Europe.\r\nWe note the growing support for our initiative to \r\ndraft an international convention for the suppression \r\nof acts of chemical and biological terrorism. The \r\nstart of serious negotiations on that issue and on the \r\nRussia-China draft treaty on the prevention of the \r\nplacement of weapons in outer space would help break \r\nthe impasse in the key body of the United Nations \r\nmultilateral disarmament architecture: the Conference \r\non Disarmament. We call for substantial examination of \r\nour proposals to improve the Convention on Biological \r\nand Toxin Weapons.\r\nNATO member countries brought conventional \r\narms control in Europe to a deep deadlock. Our \r\nattempts to save it have faced a tough ideology-driven \r\ncounteraction. All ideas to return to that issue would \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n42/58 16-29667\r\nbe meaningful only if NATO countries recognized \r\nthe absolute futility of ultimatums aimed at achieving \r\nunilateral advantages. We continue to be open to \r\nan equitable and mutually respectful dialogue with \r\nNATO, including through the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization.\r\nIt is necessary to work towards strengthening \r\nstability and equal and indivisible security in other parts \r\nof the world, especially in the Asia-Pacific region. The \r\nrecent actions of North Korea, which violate Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, must be stopped. We call on \r\nPyongyang to abandon its nuclear-missile programmes \r\nand return to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons regime. However, it is inadmissible to \r\nuse that situation as a pretext for a massive militarization \r\nof North-East Asia and a deployment of another set of \r\nUnited States global missile-defence systems. All sides \r\nmust refrain from the further escalation of tension and \r\nembark on the way toward a political and diplomatic \r\nsettlement of the nuclear problem on the Korean \r\npeninsula through the resumption of the talks.\r\nWe will continue the dialogue within the framework \r\nof the East Asia Summits on the establishment of \r\nregional security and cooperation architecture in the \r\nAsia-Pacific region based on non-bloc foundations. A \r\nnumber of participating countries, including Russia, \r\nIndia, China and Indonesia, have submitted their views \r\non that topic. \r\nWe invite the countries of the region to agree on the \r\nways to implement the initiative presented by President \r\nPutin to establish an extended Eurasia Partnership \r\nwith the participation of the Eurasian Economic Union \r\ncountries and other members of the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States, as well as the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganisation (SCO) and the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations and other interested States. I would \r\nlike to underline that the aforementioned initiative is \r\nopen and fully in line with the earlier plans to create a \r\ntrade bloc between Russia and the European Union and \r\nis founded on the basis of World Trade Organization \r\nnorms and principles, unlike other projects involving \r\nclose trade blocs that undermine the unity of global \r\ntrade systems.\r\nWe will continue to promote the unification agenda \r\nin various international forums — the United Nations, \r\nthe forum of the Brazil, Russia, India, China and South \r\nAfrica group, the SCO, and the Group of 20 (G-20). \r\nThe recent summit in Hangzhou reaffirmed the status \r\nof the G-20 as a leading global economic and financial \r\nforum. We thank the Chinese chairmanship for its \r\nefforts to use that representative platform effectively \r\nfor the exchange of views on the key issues of the global \r\neconomy and on policies for the subsequent promotion \r\nof such agreements in the universal format of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe signing of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange has become an important event among United \r\nNations activities. The communication of nationally \r\ndetermined contributions on a voluntary basis moves \r\nus toward achieving the objectives of the Agreement, \r\nnamely, to hold the increase in the average global \r\ntemperature to below 2°C. Clear rules and procedures \r\nto implement the provisions of the Paris Agreement, \r\nbearing in mind the interests of all countries \r\nparticipating in the process, should be developed in \r\norder to achieve success. \r\nIn that context, the launch of market and non-market \r\nmechanisms to reduce emissions of greenhouse \r\ngases, as stipulated in article VI of the Agreement, is \r\na priority matter. In the final analysis, that would be \r\nof crucial importance in preventing violations of the \r\ncompetitive environment and the transfer of polluting \r\nindustries and dirty production from one country \r\nto another, which hampers the achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\r\nThe United Nations was established to save \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war and \r\ndevelop equitable international cooperation. Today, \r\nthat covers all areas of international life, including \r\ncommunication, political and military aspects of \r\nsecurity, climate protection, conflict settlement, \r\npeacekeeping, ensuring human rights and freedoms, \r\nsustainable development, regulating information \r\ntechnology, and efforts to combat terrorism, drug-\r\ntrafficking and corruption. Furthermore, it includes \r\nissues ranging from the eradication of infectious \r\ndiseases to ensuring the social responsibility of \r\nbusinesses and fostering scientific and technological \r\nprogress.\r\nIn addition, of course, the United Nations must \r\npromote civil dialogue, thereby strengthening pluralism, \r\ncultures and traditions and serving as a catalyst for \r\nprogress in science and the arts. In essence, we are \r\ntalking about preserving humanity in all of its riches \r\nand diversity. That goal should constitute the basis for \r\nour collective efforts. It should become an imperative \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 43/58\r\nfor global development and an incentive for improving \r\nglobal governance and the true democratization of \r\ninternational relations.\r\nI would like to express our gratitude to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who has made enormous \r\nefforts, in his position as Secretary-General, to renew \r\nthe United Nations through timely actions. We believe \r\nthat the new Secretary-General will also make a \r\nvaluable contribution.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Edward Nalbandian, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Armenia.\r\nMr. Nalbandian (Armenia) (spoke in French): \r\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at this session, and \r\nto wish him complete success. I thank his predecessor, \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, and take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our high appreciation to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his able leadership.\r\nTwo days ago, Armenia celebrated the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of its independence. During that short period \r\nof time, much has been done to strengthen democratic \r\ninstitutions, the rule of law and good governance, to \r\nprotect human rights and to advance economic reforms. \r\nWe have been able to achieve significant progress also \r\nwith regard to the socioeconomic development agenda. \r\nHowever, challenges still remain. The needs of the \r\nsocially most vulnerable groups have been placed at \r\nthe centre of Armenia’s forward-looking development \r\nstrategy for 2014-2025. Likewise, our Government has \r\nlaunched a national plan of action on the protection of \r\nhuman rights. In that respect, Armenia continues to \r\nwork actively with all United Nations human rights \r\nmechanisms, including the special procedures and the \r\ntreaty bodies.\r\nOur new constitutional reform followed an \r\ninclusive process of broad public discussions aimed at \r\nimplementing a new and improved governance system \r\nwith increased transparency and accountability. It was \r\napproved in a nationwide referendum last December \r\nand welcomed by relevant international bodies.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe United Nations has a considerable role to \r\nplay in changing the environment, which has been \r\nconducive to intolerance, racial discrimination, \r\nxenophobia, violent extremism and terrorism. On \r\nnumerous occasions Armenia has condemned the \r\ncrimes committed by Da’esh and other terrorist groups \r\nthat threaten the peoples of the region and beyond. \r\nThe war in Syria has had a devastating impact on its \r\ncivilian population, including national and religious \r\nminorities who face existential threats in the form of \r\nidentity-based crimes. The violence has not bypassed \r\nSyrian-Armenians, many of whom have lost their lives. \r\nArmenian settlements, churches, schools and cultural \r\ninstitutions have been destroyed.\r\nOne hundred years ago, Armenian refugees found \r\nshelter in many Arab countries after the Armenian \r\ngenocide. Today, thousands of Armenians, together \r\nwith other peoples of the Middle East, have again \r\nbeen forced to f lee their homes. From Syria, more \r\nthan 20,000 have found refuge in Armenia. We know, \r\ntherefore, what it means to be a refugee and to host \r\nrefugees. The Government of Armenia has undertaken \r\nconsiderable efforts to assist the refugees and facilitate \r\ntheir integration. \r\nWe believe that wider international cooperation is \r\nneeded to adequately address the challenges posed by \r\nthe massive displacements. The full implementation of \r\nthe commitments made in the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1), adopted a \r\nfew days ago by the Assembly, stands as an important \r\nmilestone in that regard.\r\nWe would like to stress the significance of \r\naddressing the root causes of large movements of \r\npeople by working for the prevention of crimes \r\nagainst humanity and for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes and lasting political solutions. Armenia has \r\nbeen continuously supporting and contributing to the \r\nelaboration of prevention mechanisms, in particular \r\nby regularly initiating resolutions on the prevention of \r\ngenocide in the Human Rights Council.\r\nAs a nation that experienced the first genocide of \r\nthe twentieth century and continues to face the denial \r\nof that horror, Armenia reaffirms its strong support \r\nfor the fight against impunity for genocide. The year \r\n2016 marks the first anniversary of resolution 69/323, \r\ninitiated by Armenia, proclaiming 9 December as the \r\nInternational Day of Commemoration and Dignity \r\nof the Victims of the Crime of Genocide and of the \r\nPrevention of this Crime.\r\nAs the threat of violence continues to spread in \r\nvarious parts of the world, it is crucial to make our joint \r\nefforts to achieve peace and security more effective. \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n44/58 16-29667\r\nBased on that understanding, Armenia has participated \r\nin a number of United Nations actions and United \r\nNations-mandated peace operations, thus actively \r\ncontributing in the most direct way to the building \r\nof international peace and security. As the Assistant \r\nSecretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations noted \r\nrecently, “Armenia’s support is important not only for \r\nits contribution but also for Armenian history and the \r\nchallenges overcome during it”. Indeed, history teaches \r\nus that the security of one is closely connected to that \r\nof others.\r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the International Covenants on Human \r\nRights, as well as the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nDeclaration on the Right to Development. The latter \r\naffirms\r\n“the right of peoples to self-determination, by virtue \r\nof which they have the right freely to determine \r\ntheir political status and to pursue their economic, \r\nsocial and cultural development” (resolution \r\n41/128, annex, sixth preambular paragraph).\r\nIt is well known that the Charter of the United Nations \r\nunderlines respect for the principles of the equal rights \r\nand the self-determination of peoples as a purpose of \r\nthe Organization.\r\nAggressive military responses on the part of \r\nStates to the peaceful aspirations of people to exercise \r\ntheir right to self-determination only legitimize such \r\naspirations and deprives the aggressor of any claim to \r\nauthority over the people. The Independent Expert on the \r\npromotion of a democratic and equitable international \r\norder rightly pointed out that self-determination should \r\nnot be viewed as a source of conflict, but rather that \r\nconflict is a consequence of the violation of the right to \r\nself-determination.\r\nAzerbaijan stubbornly refuses to recognize the \r\nright of the people of Nagorno Karabakh to self-\r\ndetermination. As part of Azerbaijan’s policy of ethnic \r\ncleansing and aggression, starting in the late 1980s and \r\nthe early 1990s, Armenians have been massacred and \r\nexpelled from their homes. Nobel Peace Prize winner \r\nAndrei Sakharov called those actions a threat of a new \r\ngenocide against the Armenian people.\r\nThis year again, in early April, in blatant violation of \r\nthe ceasefire agreement, Azerbaijan unleashed another \r\nlarge-scale aggression against Nagorno Karabakh, \r\nindiscriminately targeting civilian infrastructure and \r\nthe population. Among the victims were a 12-year-old \r\nboy and 92-year-old woman. Three captured soldiers \r\nof the Nagorno Karabakh armed forces were beheaded \r\nin Da’esh style, which was subsequently shown in \r\ntowns and villages and publicized through the social \r\nmedia. Furthermore, the leader of Azerbaijan publicly \r\ndecorated the perpetrators of that crime. During \r\nthe exchange of the bodies of the deceased between \r\nNagorno Karabakh and Azerbaijan, which was mediated \r\nby the International Committee of the Red Cross, it \r\nwas registered that the corpses transferred from the \r\nAzerbaijani side bore undeniable signs of torture and \r\nwere mutilated. Such despicable atrocities go beyond \r\nthe basic norms of the civilized world and constitute \r\ngross violations of international humanitarian law.\r\nThe aggression in April severely undermined the \r\npeace process. To restore trust and work for a peaceful \r\nresolution of the conflict, measures should be taken \r\nto prevent the use of force and to create conditions \r\nconducive to the advancement of the peace process. \r\nThat was the main aim of two summit meetings on \r\nNagorno Karabakh, held in Vienna in May and St. \r\nPetersburg in June. It is imperative to implement what \r\nwas particularly emphasized and agreed upon at those \r\nmeetings: first, the full adherence to the 1994 and 1995 \r\ntrilateral ceasefire agreements, which do not have time \r\nlimitations; secondly, the creation of a mechanism to \r\ninvestigate ceasefire violations; thirdly, the expansion \r\nof the capacity of the Personal Representative of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) Chairperson-in-Office. Against all odds the \r\npeople of Nagorno Karabakh have been able to defend \r\nthemselves and create a free and democratic society.\r\nArmenia, together with the mediator \r\ncountries — Russia, the United States and France, \r\nwhich are the co-Chairs of the OSCE Minsk Group —\r\nwill continue its efforts towards an exclusively peaceful \r\nresolution of the Nagorno Karabakh conflict. The \r\nco-Chairs have proposed a rather civilized formula for \r\nthe settlement — ballots instead of bullets. The proposal \r\noutlined by the Presidents of the co-Chair countries \r\nstipulates the future determination of the final legal \r\nstatus of Nagorno Karabakh through a legally binding \r\nexpression of the will of its population. The mentality \r\nthat supports medieval barbarism, as witnessed in \r\nApril, has difficulty accepting the civilized approaches \r\nof the modern world.\r\nArmenia welcomes the integration of the Vienna \r\nProgramme of Action for the Landlocked Developing \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 45/58\r\nCountries for the Decade 2014-2024 into the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development as an important \r\nstep to promote sustainable and inclusive development. \r\nThe Government of Armenia has adopted a national \r\nstrategy to ensure the effective implementation of the \r\nVienna Programme of Action and make it a mainstream \r\npart of our policies. \r\nWe deplore policies that stipulate unilateral \r\neconomic measures as an instrument of political \r\npressure. Agenda 2030 reconfirms, once again, that such \r\nmeasures are detrimental to sustainable development. \r\nThe unilateral land blockade of Armenia by Turkey is \r\na gross violation of international law. It continues to \r\nseverely hamper regional transit communication routes, \r\neconomic cooperation and integration.\r\nArmenia welcomes the central role of the United \r\nNations in the implementation of the comprehensive \r\nnew 2030 Agenda. We do not underestimate the \r\nchallenges facing all of us, and similarly, we should not \r\ndownplay the opportunities. With the more than seven \r\ndecades of the United Nations existence, we must show \r\nthe same insight and vision to safeguard the future of \r\nthe Organization and ensure the best possible future \r\nfor the peoples of the United Nations. Armenia is fully \r\ncommitted to those goals.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Frank-Walter Steinmeier, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Federal Republic of Germany.\r\nMr. Steinmeier (Germany) (spoke in German; \r\ninterpretation provided by delegation): For far too \r\nmany people, the world has become an unsafe place. \r\nThe challenges confronting us seem immense, and \r\nat times it seems all but hopeless to find solutions to \r\nthe many conflicts around us. However, all of us here, \r\nas politicians, have a choice. The choice is between \r\nresignation and engagement in those crises, between \r\nisolation and multilateral cooperation, and between \r\nnational navel-gazing and shared responsibility for one \r\nanother.\r\nWe have the choice. Do we relinquish the \r\ncivilizational progress achieved by the founding \r\ngeneration of the United Nations after experiencing two \r\nworld wars and turn back to the nineteenth century? Do \r\nwe return to the era of fragile, purpose-oriented power \r\nalliances and power struggles among nation States? Or \r\ndo we move forward and work together to master the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century, whether they be \r\nmigration, climate change or terrorism?\r\nIn light of the dramatic meetings on Syria this \r\nweek, I would like to add that we can also choose \r\nwhether to put our faith in the power of diplomacy, or to \r\nshrug our shoulders in resignation at the many conflicts \r\naround us — Syria, Libya, Yemen and eastern Ukraine. \r\nDo we give up and allow those conflicts to escalate \r\neven further? Or do we live up to our responsibility and \r\ncontinue working on solutions despite all the setbacks? \r\nWe have the choice.\r\nIn Europe, too, we are faced with a choice, now that \r\nthe United Kingdom has made its choice and has opted \r\nto leave the European Union. Do we now fight to hold \r\nEurope together? Or do we allow that wonderful peace \r\nand social project to fall apart again, or even allow \r\npopulists to drive us apart? We have the choice. \r\nIn Asia, too, where new Powers are jostling for \r\ninfluence, there is also a choice. Do they believe that \r\ntheir future will depend solely on their own strength? \r\nOr does the key to a bright future and cooperative \r\nsecurity lie in their involvement in the international \r\norder? Our Asian partners have the choice.\r\nThe United States is also faced with a choice, \r\nin six weeks’ time. There, too, the choice is about a \r\nsupposedly possible withdrawal from a crisis-ridden \r\nworld, which some are calling for, or cooperation with \r\ninternational partners to solve the world’s problems. \r\nThat choice is important for all of us. The choice before \r\nus is withdrawal, resignation and going it alone, or \r\nshared responsibility for a better future.\r\nWhether we succeed in finding durable solutions \r\nto the major pressing challenges we face depends on \r\nthe decision we make on that choice. I am talking in \r\nparticular now about the Syrian crisis and the issue \r\nof refugees and migration. However, far beyond acute \r\ncrisis management, that also presents us with a choice \r\non which direction our world takes, and in what kind of \r\ninternational order we will live together in the future.\r\nThe objective and focus of German foreign policy \r\nare clear — we want to shape a just and peaceful world, \r\nand we want to shape it together with all partners who \r\nshare that goal. The United Nations is and will remain \r\nour central forum for that. In the context of all the \r\ncrisis meetings, it gives me hope that we, here in the \r\nUnited Nations, have made an important choice about \r\nthe direction we want to take, that is, the right choice.\r\nOur choice has also been for unity, sustainability \r\nand transformation with the document that we adopted \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n46/58 16-29667\r\nlast year: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda is a global compact on the world’s \r\nfuture, the focal point, the point of convergence for our \r\njoint actions. Our policies should be based on human \r\nrights, the rule of law and the fight against poverty \r\nand discrimination. We will also put global justice on \r\nthe agenda of the Group of 20 when we assume the \r\nchairmanship in 2017.\r\nI wish to express our thanks to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon, who initiated the 2030 Agenda. We \r\nwould also like to thank him for his commitment to the \r\nhistoric Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which the \r\nGerman Parliament ratified earlier this week. Where if \r\nnot here, at the United Nations, could we demonstrate \r\nthat, solely through cooperation, we can move forward \r\ntowards justice and sustainability, towards peace \r\nand security. The Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law provide the foundation for that.\r\nNorth Korea has, in a blatant manner, repeatedly \r\nviolated central principles of international law. We \r\ncondemn in the strongest possible terms the latest \r\nnuclear test carried out by North Korea. We cannot \r\naccept any country jeopardizing security in that region.\r\nThe United Nations provides the tools we need \r\nfor our work here in New York and in crisis-stricken \r\nregions. In Libya and Yemen, we are supporting the \r\ntireless efforts of the Special Envoys of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to find political solutions. In Syria, it is clear \r\nthat without the dedicated work of the United Nations \r\nand its experts, there would be even more suffering \r\ntoday and there would be even less hope for a solution. \r\nThe hope raised a week ago by the ceasefire has again \r\nvanished, following the deadly, cynical and despicable \r\nattack on humanitarian aid workers a few days ago.\r\nToday the situation could not be more serious. We \r\nare again faced with the choice. Will we succeed in \r\ntaking the first step towards a ceasefire, which would \r\nfinally make humanitarian access possible so that \r\npeople can receive what they need to survive? To that \r\nend, I have proposed an agreement on banning military \r\nf lights during a period of several days. Al-Assad’s Air \r\nForce must cease its attacks. I believe that Moscow also \r\nhas a responsibility to help bring that about. If we do \r\nnot succeed, then all efforts to find a political solution \r\nto Syria will be lost in a hail of bombs. For that reason \r\nalone, although unsuccessful yesterday, our efforts in \r\nthe International Syria Support Group for a ceasefire \r\nmust continue.\r\nWhile the international community works hard in \r\nNew York to bring about a ceasefire, Al-Assad continues \r\nto bomb Aleppo to bits, which again demonstrates that \r\nthe Al-Assad regime cannot and must not be allowed to \r\ndetermine Syria’s future. However, we also cannot allow \r\nthe conflict to be used by nearby or distant Powers to \r\nredraw the political and ethnic map of the Middle East. \r\nSyria’s external borders must remain, and we should \r\nnot allow new internal borders to be defined. The \r\nparties in the country and the region can, and indeed \r\nshould, declare their legitimate interests. However, a \r\nfair balance of those interests must be found. Insisting \r\non one of the many absolute truths will not bring peace \r\nany closer. I reiterate and want to be quite clear: there \r\nwill be no winners in that war.\r\nIn the face of such suffering, we have an obligation \r\nto try right now to alleviate the plight of the Syrian \r\npeople. Currently, Germany is one of the biggest donors \r\nof humanitarian aid. To date, we have made available \r\napproximately $2.5 billion for Syria and its neighbours. \r\nWe have been particularly active in helping to stabilize \r\nareas in Iraq that have been liberated from the Islamic \r\nState. In Tikrit, we joined forces with United Nations \r\nagencies to rebuild schools and wells, so that as many \r\nas 90 per cent of those who have f led could return. In \r\nRamadi, we are concentrating on unexploded mine \r\nclearance. In the case of Mosul, we are currently \r\npreparing to help local forces to begin rebuilding \r\nthe city, which we hope will be liberated soon. At \r\nthe same time, we are promoting access to education \r\nand the labour market in the countries neighbouring \r\nSyria — Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon — so that the \r\npeople can have a future in their own region.\r\nIn 2015 in Germany, we welcomed and gave shelter \r\nto more than 1 million people. We have begun training \r\nrefugees so that they acquire the skills needed to rebuild \r\ntheir cities. The objective is to ensure that the belief in \r\na future at home does not remain a mere hope but can \r\nbecome a reality. \r\nOur response to refugee movements and migration \r\nmust be a joint, global task in full awareness of the \r\nfuture. Clearly, the challenge will become even bigger if \r\nconflicts, hardship and poverty persist. That is why we \r\nmust tackle the root causes together. Moreover, we must \r\nimprove the architectural framework of international \r\nefforts designed to deal with refugee movements and \r\nmigration. As co-Chair, along with Morocco, of the \r\nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development, we want \r\nto play our part during the next two years. Through \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 47/58\r\nthe Berlin Round Table on Refugees and Migration, \r\nwe are focusing on improving the structures of \r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nThe General Assembly’s high-level plenary \r\nmeeting on addressing large movements of refugees \r\nand migrants, held on 19 September, took important \r\ndecisions on still more joint actions. We wish to convey \r\nour thanks to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and \r\nUnited States President Barack Obama for hosting the \r\n20 September Leaders’ Summit on Refugees, alongside \r\nco-hosts Canada, Ethiopia, Germany, Jordan, Mexico \r\nand Sweden.\r\nWe also need to revitalize engagement and \r\ncooperation in Europe as well. New rifts have emerged \r\non our continent following Russia’s annexation of \r\nCrimea, in violation of international law and the conflict \r\nin eastern Ukraine. The security situation has changed, \r\nand we need to react. First, we need to strengthen our \r\nreadiness to defend ourselves. At the same time, we \r\nmust also be engaged. Together with France, Russia \r\nand Ukraine, we have been working tirelessly in the \r\nNormandy format on a political solution to the Ukraine \r\nconflict. Progress has finally been achieved with the \r\nTrilateral Contact Group’s framework resolution on the \r\ndisengagement of forces, which was ratified this week. \r\nA ceasefire is not all that is needed for the Package \r\nof Measures for the Implementation of the Minsk \r\nAgreements, but we cannot make any political headway \r\nif the weapons are not silenced.\r\nHowever, there is much more at stake. We must \r\nbe aware that genuine and lasting security in Europe \r\ncan only take the form of cooperative security. That is \r\nwhy, as I have proposed, we must pay more attention \r\nto arms control in Europe. Such efforts are not meant \r\nto substitute for obligations not yet met. Rather, I have \r\nin mind new challenges, new technologies and new \r\nthreats, many of which have not even been mentioned \r\nin existing documents. Our goal is to enable security \r\nfor everyone.\r\nAs we seek to strengthen the dialogue between \r\nEast and West, especially in these difficult times, we \r\nhave assumed the chairmanship of the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) this \r\nyear. It is, by the way, the sole organization in which \r\nEast and West continue to work together on a regular \r\nbasis. We need the United Nations, as well as regional \r\ninstitutions such as the African Union and the OSCE, in \r\norder to ensure that diverging interests and differences \r\nof opinion do not turn into lasting alienation, thereby \r\npreparing the ground for even more new conflicts.\r\nOur own history reminds us Germans that we must \r\ndo everything we can to overcome the rifts in Europe. \r\nWhen Willy Brandt, then Chancellor of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany, spoke in the General Assembly \r\non 26 September 1973, after the f lags of the two parts \r\nof Germany had been hoisted in front of this building, \r\nhe said: \r\n“In a world in which we are all increasingly \r\ndependent on each other, a policy for peace must \r\nnot stop at our own doorstep.” (A/PV.2128, para. \r\n33)\r\nThis is all the more true today in our interconnected \r\nworld than it was back then. And it is all the more true \r\nfor a large and prosperous country that our partners, \r\nrightly, perceive should play a role commensurate to its \r\nsize and capabilities. It is for that reason that Germany \r\nis applying for a non-permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil for the 2019-2020 term. Peace, justice, \r\ninnovation and partnership — those are our goals. \r\nThey are the leitmotif of our candidature. and we will \r\nbe guided by them.\r\nDespite crises and conflicts, I still firmly believe \r\nthat the future lies in our hands. We will make the world \r\na better place if we assume responsibility together — not \r\nagainst but with one another and, above all, if we work \r\nfor those who follow us as the next generation. We have \r\nthe choice. But we have to decide!\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Ri Yong Ho(Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea) (spoke in Korean; English text provided by \r\nthe delegation): First of all, allow me to congratulate \r\nMr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session. I hope \r\nthat his able stewardship will lead this session to a \r\nsuccessful outcome. I also hope that this session, under \r\nthe theme “Sustainable Development Goals: a universal \r\npush to transform our world”, will make a meaningful \r\ncontribution to promoting the peaceful development \r\nand prosperity of all countries.\r\nPeace and security are the permanent themes of \r\nthe United Nations. The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals presuppose peace and security. Even at this \r\nvery moment, when the United Nations aspires to a \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n48/58 16-29667\r\ntransformation through sustainable development, the \r\nworld is besieged with the wild wind of terrorism, \r\nan unprecedented war-driven refugee crisis and an \r\nincreasing number of global hot spots.\r\nThe Korean peninsula has now been turned into the \r\nworld’s most dangerous hot spot and could even ignite \r\na nuclear war. A peaceful environment is the foremost \r\nprerequisite for the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, which has embarked on the implementation of \r\nits national five-year economic development strategy to \r\nre-energize the overall economy and lay the foundation \r\nfor its sustainable development.\r\nAs the international community witnesses every \r\nyear, the Korean peninsula is often engulfed in a \r\nsituation that can spiral out of control. Its root cause \r\nlies squarely with the United States of America, which \r\nrefuses to abandon its hostile policy towards the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, but instead \r\nholds aggressive war exercises, one after another, in \r\nand around the Korean peninsula. The large-scale joint \r\nmilitary exercises conducted by the United States in \r\nMarch and April and in August and September this \r\nyear were extremely provocative and massive military \r\nmanoeuvres. They involved over 500,000 troops and \r\nstrategic assets that included strategic nuclear bombers \r\nand strategic nuclear submarines. Their scale is more \r\nthan large enough to wage an all-out war.\r\nSuch nuclear war exercises are extremely \r\noffensive and aggressive, as they mainly include high-\r\nprecision strikes, commando infiltration, landing and \r\npre-emptive nuclear strikes aimed at the decapitation \r\nof the leadership of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and the occupation of Pyongyang. Nowhere \r\nin the world today are such large-scale joint military \r\nexercises as those around the Korean peninsula \r\nconducted, nor do war games of such a provocative \r\nand offensive nature take place. Never have such \r\nundisguised military threats and extremely dangerous \r\nand aggressive exercises occurred right under the nose \r\nof an adversary.\r\nNo proper institutional peace mechanism has been \r\nestablished on the Korean peninsula. The war of the \r\n1950s has not ended, but a temporary armistice remains \r\nin force. That means that neither side feels the need to \r\nmake a declaration of war if it wants to begin fighting \r\nagain. It is a place where provocative military acts \r\nsuch as large-scale joint military exercises can easily \r\ninfuriate the other side, provoking a response.\r\nAny incident could easily lead to a conflict and \r\nescalate into all-out war. Concerns are increasingly \r\nbeing voiced about the aggravation of tensions by these \r\nlarge-scale joint military exercises. We hear concerns \r\nbeing expressed in neighbouring countries, many \r\ncountries of the region and even the United States of \r\nAmerica and South Korea. The Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea has made every possible effort to \r\nprevent an armed conflict and its escalation, while \r\ntaking the necessary self-defensive countermeasures, \r\nwhenever the United States and South Korea conduct \r\nprovocative, aggressive joint military exercises.\r\nThe respected leader Comrade Kim Jong Un, \r\nChairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea and \r\nChairman of the State Affairs Commission of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, noted at the \r\nseventh Congress of the Party that the United States \r\nshould abandon its anachronistic hostile policy towards \r\nour country, replace the Korean Armistice Agreement \r\nwith a peace agreement and withdraw its armed forces \r\nand war equipment from South Korea. He also clarified \r\nthat dialogue and negotiations were needed, above all, \r\nbetween the military authorities of North and South \r\nKorea so as to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula \r\nand achieve national reunification. But there has been \r\nno positive response, and the large-scale joint military \r\nexercises targeting the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea have continued. And they are becoming more \r\nand more provocative and aggressive.\r\nCurrently on the international scene, the \r\nfundamental, widely recognized principles of \r\ninternational relations are being openly ignored by the \r\nUnited States-led imperialist forces in their outrageous \r\nschemes for domination and intervention, while justice \r\nis being criminalized and transformed into injustice, \r\ndepending on the interests of the imperialist Powers. \r\nTo safeguard international peace and security and \r\nachieve sustainable development, genuine international \r\njustice must be realized without fail. Article 1 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations refers to bringing about\r\n“by peaceful means, and in conformity with \r\nthe principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of \r\nthe peace”.\r\nHowever, when the Security Council  deals with the \r\nissue of the Korean peninsula, it now covers up the \r\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness of the United States \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 49/58\r\nof America in the name of the United Nations, ignoring \r\njustice and international law.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea, in accordance with Articles 34 and \r\n35 of the Charter, has on several occasions requested \r\nthe Security Council to hold an emergency meeting on \r\nthe threat to international peace and security posed by \r\nthe large-scale United States joint military exercises on \r\nthe Korean peninsula. This year alone, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea made such requests to the \r\nSecurity Council in March and in August, but the \r\nCouncil rejected them every time. On the other hand, \r\nthe Security Council takes issue with the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s rightful self-defence \r\nmeasures to safeguard its sovereignty, dignity and \r\nnational security.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea had no \r\nother choice but to go nuclear after doing everything \r\npossible to defend its national security from the constant \r\nUnited States nuclear threat, which has persisted since \r\nthe 1950s. Our decision to strengthen our nuclear \r\narmament is a rightful self-defence measure to protect \r\nourselves from constant United States nuclear threats. \r\nNevertheless, the Security Council, as recently as in its \r\nresolution 2270 (2016), declared that the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s ongoing nuclear and \r\nballistic missile-related activities pose a clear threat \r\nto international peace and security. That resolution is \r\nthe latest fabrication against my country. As for the \r\nlegal basis for the resolution, neither the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations nor any other international convention \r\nhas a provision stipulating that nuclear and ballistic \r\nmissile activity represents a threat to international \r\npeace and security.\r\nIn practice, countries that began the same activities \r\nlong before the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nhave never been called into question in the Security \r\nCouncil. One cannot help but ask on what grounds and \r\nwith what authority did the Security Council adopt \r\nresolution 2270 (2016), which prohibits the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea from engaging in nuclear \r\nand ballistic missile activities. If the Council has such \r\ngrounds and authority, why does it not adopt resolutions \r\nagainst countries that conduct the same nuclear \r\nand ballistic rocket tests? We submitted an official \r\nquestionnaire to the Secretariat of the United Nations \r\nin this regard, but nearly four months have elapsed and \r\nthe Secretariat has not responded.\r\nYet, the reason is clear. It is because the Security \r\nCouncil is the place where guilt or innocence is \r\ndecided on the basis not of justice, but of whether one \r\nhas the veto power. The United States of America does \r\nnot have the moral authority to force United Nations \r\nMember States to implement this kind of undeserved \r\nresolution, and Member States have no moral obligation \r\nto implement these unfair and unjust resolutions.\r\nLast week, the 17th Summit of the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries (NAM) was held on the \r\nbeautiful island of Margarita in Venezuela. In the \r\nfinal document, the Heads of State and Government \r\nexpressed concern that\r\n“In recent years, the Security Council has been too \r\nquick to threaten or authorize enforcement action \r\nin some cases while being silent and inactive in \r\nothers”.\r\nThey underlined that\r\n“Sanctions should be imposed only when a threat \r\nto international peace and security or an act of \r\naggression takes place, in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.”\r\nIn the Final Declaration of the Margarita Summit, \r\nthe Heads of State and Government\r\n“expressed their condemnation at the promulgation \r\nand application of unilateral coercive measures \r\nagainst countries of the Movement, in violation of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nlaw, particularly the principles of non-intervention, \r\nself-determination and independence of States”.\r\nThis is the common position of the NAM countries that \r\nmake up nearly two thirds of the membership of the \r\nUnited Nations. This is the true voice of the international \r\ncommunity. International justice never comes by itself; \r\nit can be achieved only when the voice of independent \r\ncountries against imperialism grows strong.\r\nOpting to become an armed nuclear Power is our \r\nState policy. As long as there is a nuclear-weapon State \r\nthat is hostile to the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, our national security and peace on the Korean \r\npeninsula can be defended only by means of a credible \r\nnuclear deterrent. The reason why we had no other option \r\nbut to strengthen our nuclear deterrence unreservedly \r\nmay not be easily understood by European countries, \r\nwhose security awareness attenuated following the end \r\nof the Cold War 25 years ago, or by countries that have \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n50/58 16-29667\r\nnever had the nuclear weapons of a hostile Power on \r\ntheir doorstep and in their air space.\r\nThe successful nuclear warhead explosion test that \r\nwe conducted recently is a practical countermeasure \r\ntaken in reaction to the host of threats and sanctions \r\nfrom hostile forces, including the United States of \r\nAmerica, that viciously make an issue of the exercise by \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea of its right \r\nto self-defence. The test also demonstrates our Party’s \r\nand people’s strongest will ever in its readiness to wage \r\na counter-attack against provocation by enemies.\r\nOnly a couple of days ago, the United States again \r\nthreatened the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nby f lying B-1B strategic bombers over the Military \r\nDemarcation Line on the Korean peninsula and landing \r\nin South Korea. We will never remain onlookers \r\nto such acts of provocation, and the United States \r\nwill have to face inconceivable consequences. The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea will continue \r\nto take measures to strengthen its national nuclear-\r\narmed forces, both quantitatively and qualitatively, in \r\norder to defend its dignity and right to existence, and to \r\nsafeguard genuine peace vis-à-vis the increased threat \r\nof nuclear war by the United States.\r\nIn order to safeguard global peace and security by \r\nrealizing genuine international justice, and to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals set by the United \r\nNations, the old international order, where injustice \r\nprevails under the guise of justice, must be destroyed \r\nto give way to a new international order of impartiality \r\nand justice.\r\nThe blockade unjustly imposed on Cuba by the \r\nUnited States of America for the past several decades is \r\na typical example of the total absence of international \r\njustice. The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea takes this opportunity to extend full \r\nsupport and solidarity to the Government and people \r\nof Cuba in their struggle to safeguard the dignity and \r\nsovereignty of the nation and realize international \r\njustice in the face of the high-handedness, arbitrariness \r\nand unilateral blockade of the United States.\r\nInternational justice should be realized as soon as \r\npossible in the Palestine issue and in those countries \r\nand regions like Syria, Iraq and Libya that face the \r\nturbulence of war and violence owing to the unbridled \r\ninterference of the United States in the internal affairs \r\nof sovereign States.\r\nThe covert political attempts of the United States \r\nand Western countries to infringe upon the sovereignty \r\nof independent African countries by abusing recourse \r\nto the International Criminal Court should be held in \r\ncheck. The double standard of the United States and its \r\nsupporting Powers should be resolutely rejected; they \r\npoliticize human rights issues to intentionally demonize \r\nthe anti-imperialist and independent countries, and they \r\nmisuse human rights as a tool of colour revolutions.\r\nIf the United Nations relinquishes justice, no \r\ncountry will place its hopes in the Organization. Any \r\ncountry that the United States regards as an antagonist \r\nand has targeted for regime change is automatically \r\ncategorized as a country with human rights problems, \r\nwithout exception. That is the practice pursued at today’s \r\nUnited Nations. The Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea is one such country, but that only goes to show \r\nthat we are an independent country that is against the \r\nUnited States and its supporting Powers. The United \r\nStates raises the issue of our human rights because it is \r\nat a loss in dealing with the nuclear issue. If it is at a loss \r\nagain as to what human rights question to pursue, it will \r\ntake up another issue to continue its attempt to stif le the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. However, our \r\npeople will never renounce socialism and the system of \r\nabsolute service that they themselves have chosen, as a \r\nresult of United States policies.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea will push ahead with its vigorous \r\nstruggle to remove the root cause of the threat of \r\nnuclear war imposed by the United States. This it will \r\ndo by having a powerful nuclear deterrent, with a view \r\nto safeguarding peace and security on the Korean \r\npeninsula, and in Asia and the world at large, and to \r\ndenuclearizing the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Péter Szijjártó, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade of Hungary.\r\nMr. Szijjártó (Hungary): It is an honour for me to \r\nstand here in front of such a distinguished audience, \r\nespecially in 2016, the year marking the sixtieth \r\nanniversary of the 1956 uprising, when the Hungarian \r\npeople rose up and fought for their freedom against \r\nthe Communist oppressors. In 1956, Hungary did not \r\nreceive external help and so our revolution and fight \r\nfor freedom was defeated, but the heroic efforts of \r\nour freedom fighters gave us the strength to survive \r\nthe dictatorship and to finally gain freedom in 1990. \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 51/58\r\nSo today I can stand here before everyone as a \r\nrepresentative of a free and proud nation, a nation that \r\nis proud of its traditions, culture, Christianity and past \r\nstruggles for freedom.\r\nObviously, at this rostrum we do not need to say that \r\nthe world has expeienced enormous global challenges \r\nthat have recently led to dramatic changes in the \r\ntradional world order. Let me just emphasize three of \r\nthe important factors responsible for those changes. All \r\nof us have witnessed, and unfortunately experienced, \r\nthe worldwide spread of terrorist organizations. Day \r\nby day we witness the destabilization of some key and \r\nvulnerable regions of the world. And day by day we face \r\nthe fact that around 60 to 65 million people globally are \r\non the move, or being displaced, for various reasons.\r\nThese three factors have led to dramatic changes \r\nin the world order. I think that it is no longer an \r\nexaggeration to say that this is the twenty-fourth hour \r\nand that there is but little time left for us to channel \r\nthose changes in a positive direction. However, in order \r\nto reach this goal, all of us together have to be successful \r\nin carrying out three global policy initiatives.\r\nFirst of all, we must eliminate the key factor of \r\nglobal terrorism: the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria \r\n(ISIS). Until we finally destroy ISIS, there will be \r\nno peace or stability in Europe’s southern and south-\r\neastern neighbourhoods, namely the Middle East and \r\nNorth Africa. Until we finally destroy ISIS, thousands \r\nupon thousands of people will continue to be forced \r\nto leave their homes. Until we finally destroy ISIS, \r\nChristian communities will continue to be threatened \r\nand will continue to suffer heavy attacks. Until we \r\nfinally destroy ISIS, migratory pressure on Europe will \r\nnot decrease.\r\nSecondly, we must eliminate the global network \r\nof human traffickers. We must destroy their business \r\nmodels and recognize that they have caused the deaths \r\nof thousands of innocent people. I am sure we can \r\nall agree that their crimes against humanity must not \r\nremain unpunished.\r\nThirdly, we must change the migration policies that \r\ninspire people to take their lives in their own hands to \r\nviolate borders and to move to countries thousands of \r\nmiles away. Migration is an extremely serious issue \r\nand challenge. That is why, instead of emotional \r\ndebates, we need debates based on common sense and \r\nrationality. Instead of accusing and bashing each other, \r\nwe must stand on the very stable basis of international \r\nlaw. I think it is especially pertinent to say that here, in \r\nthis Hall. International law stipulates that the right to a \r\nsafe life is a fundamental human right. But the option \r\nto pick which country to live in is not a fundamental \r\nhuman right. We must make it clear that there is no \r\nexcuse for violating the border between two safe and \r\npeaceful countries.\r\nRegarding Hungary, I am proud to report that with \r\nthe policies that we have been carrying out, we were \r\nable to contribute to appropriate responses to recent \r\nglobal challenges.\r\nFirst, Hungary is one of 23 countries that sent \r\ntroops to fight ISIS. There are 143 Hungarian men and \r\nwomen serving in Iraq. They have been taking part \r\nin actions against ISIS as a force protection unit and \r\nas Peshmerga trainers. We have sent the Peshmerga \r\narmy a significant amount of ammunition, and we have \r\nbeen taking part in the rehabilitation programme for \r\nwounded Peshmerga. We are also beginning to train \r\nIraqi army officials. In that regard, I would like to \r\nmention that we urged the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) to start investigating crimes committed by ISIS \r\nagainst Christian communities. We regret and deplore \r\nthat, despite letters sent to the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nof the ICC, no real action has been taken. We are also \r\nsaddened that the Security Council was not ready to \r\nrefer the situation in Syria to the ICC.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to inform \r\nthe Assembly that the Hungarian Government has \r\nestablished a State secretariat that monitors the position \r\nof Christian communities all over the world, determines \r\nwhether they are being persecuted and organizes help \r\nfor those communities whenever necessary. By doing \r\nso, we hope to prevent crimes committed against \r\nChristian communities from going unpunished.\r\nSecondly, regarding human trafficking, the \r\nHungarian Parliament has adopted stringent regulations \r\nagainst human traffickers, which can serve as best \r\npractices in the global struggle against smuggling \r\nnetworks.\r\nThirdly, regarding migration, Hungary ranks \r\nthe security of its people as its top priority. We have \r\nprotected our borders thus far, and we will not allow \r\nany mass border violation in future. In that connection, \r\nwe must make clear that migration policies all over \r\nthe world have failed. Migration policies that consider \r\nall migrants to be refugees have failed. Migration \r\npolicies that seek to force countries to host thousands \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n52/58 16-29667\r\nof migrants against the will of their own citizens have \r\nfailed. Migration policies based on accusing countries \r\nthat protect their own borders have also failed.\r\nThe uncontrolled and unregulated mass migration \r\nhas offered terrorist organizations the opportunity to \r\nsend their fighters and their terrorists to other countries \r\nand continents. The outcome and consequence of the \r\nuncontrolled and unregulated mass migration in Europe \r\nis the growing threat of terror and the worsening of \r\npublic security. It is obvious now that people in Europe \r\nexpect their politicians to make the restoration of \r\nsecurity a top European policy priority.\r\nOur position is absolutely clear — we must help \r\nthose in need. We must help people to stay as close to \r\ntheir homes as possible, because that will allow them \r\nto return to their homes as soon as the crises are over. \r\nThat is why we, the international community, have \r\nto support Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and the Kurdish \r\nregional Government in Iraq, because those countries \r\nand the Kurdish region have been taking care of \r\nmillions of refugees. If we do not help them, and if \r\nthose countries and that region become unstable, then \r\nthe refugees will hit the road, risking their lives trying \r\nto reach Europe. Europe will be unable to meet such a \r\nchallenge. Hungary has contributed €3 million to the \r\nMadad Fund and has made a €5 million pledge to build \r\na hospital in Syria. We have also launched a special \r\nscholarship programme for youngsters from Syria to \r\nstudy in Hungary, because we must help those in need.\r\nWe must place conditions on our development \r\nprojects and funding programmes. I think we have \r\na right to expect beneficiary countries to carry out \r\nreforms and to create conditions that will encourage \r\ntheir people to stay in their homelands. The United \r\nNations must play a vital role in settling those serious \r\nconflicts and in overcoming those serious challenges. \r\nBut, in order for it to do so, we need credibility. \r\nHungary has joined the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency Group because we believe that we must \r\nimprove the accountability and transparency of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThat is particularly true as it relates to the \r\nappointment process for the Secretary-General. We \r\nwould like to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. Lykketoft, for having ushered in the \r\nnew phase of appointing the Secretary-General by \r\norganizing a hearing and for increasing the Assembly’s \r\nrole in that process.\r\nFinally, I would like to speak as a representative of \r\na country from Central Europe. The Central European \r\nregion must face some difficult and complicated \r\nchallenges. There is a war in Ukraine that affects \r\nenergy security; we have tensions in the western \r\nBalkan region; and we have to deal with the Russia/\r\nEurope relationship. The Central and Eastern European \r\ncountries form a group within the United Nations \r\nfrom which so far no Secretary-General has been \r\nchosen during the more than 70-year history of the \r\nOrganization. This time, therefore, we are appealing \r\nto the generosity of the other four country groups in \r\nurging them to appoint a Secretary-General from \r\nCentral Europe, who would understand the mindset of \r\nthe people of Central Europe and their region and its \r\nchallenges. Such a Secretary-General could be very \r\nhelpful in enabling the Central European countries to \r\novercome some of their historical tensions and issues.\r\nFinally, I have the honour to announce Hungary’s \r\ncandidature for the Human Rights Council for the \r\n2017-2019 term. We are grateful to those countries \r\nthat have already pledged to support us. I would like \r\nto emphasize here that we are ready to work together \r\nwith our fellow States Members of the United Nations \r\nin order to contribute to making the United Nations \r\nhuman rights mechanisms more effective, with the goal \r\nof creating a better world for everyone.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Margot Wallström, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Sweden.\r\nMs. Wallström (Sweden): More than ever before, \r\nwe share a common destiny. The destiny of everyone \r\nhere is also our destiny, and we can master the \r\nchallenges of the future only if we face them together. \r\nThat is why we have the United Nations. That is why we \r\nmeet in this Assembly. \r\nToday, we are doing so at a time marked by the \r\ndestructive forces of war and the tragic plight of \r\nrefugees, such as the unspeakable horror of Syria, girls \r\nabducted and enslaved by Boko Haram, or teenagers \r\non the run who are in search of opportunity but have \r\nnever attended school. It is also marked by the return \r\nof geopolitical rivalries and isolationism. The basic \r\ntenets of our coexistence are being challenged. Acts \r\nof aggression are changing borders; nuclear weapons \r\nare proliferating and being tested; human dignity is \r\nbeing denied. We are being revisited by the spectres of \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 53/58\r\nxenophobia and aggressive nationalism, autocracy and \r\nfear-mongering. Walls are being erected.\r\nWe must and we can respond to that by empowering \r\npeople, by strengthening democracy, good governance \r\nand the rule of law, by celebrating diversity, by keeping \r\nour economies open and pushing for trade, so that \r\nwe can create decent jobs for all, by committing to \r\narresting climate change in order to save our planet, \r\nby setting ambitious goals for sustainable development, \r\nby pursuing peace through diplomacy, and by seeking \r\nsolutions through collaboration.\r\nHigh on our global agenda are the issues of \r\nmigration and refugees. As we have heard so many \r\ntimes already this week, 65 million people are f leeing \r\nfrom harm. The international community must live up \r\nto its commitments by providing protection for refugees \r\nand guaranteeing the right to seek asylum. That is a \r\nglobal responsibility, to be shouldered cooperatively \r\nand addressed comprehensively and through shared \r\ngovernance. The New York Declaration for Refugees \r\nand Migrants (resolution 71/1), which the Assembly \r\nadopted earlier this week, is a first step. But there are \r\nmany more to take. Fundamentally, we need to redouble \r\nresettlement efforts, which are the most important way \r\nto help refugees. And at the same time, we must harness \r\nthe positive effects of safe and orderly migration.\r\nThe United Nations must adapt to a changing \r\nenvironment. The Organization has achieved a great \r\ndeal in 71 years,  but it falls short of our expectations. \r\nIt is time for serious reforms that can make it fit for \r\npurpose. To succeed, we need a strong, visionary and \r\ncourageous leadership, dedicated to change, to turning \r\nambitions into concrete action and to delivering on the \r\nrecent groundbreaking multilateral achievements on \r\nclimate change, sustainable development and peace.\r\nWe need the States Members of the United Nations \r\nto heed and lead that call for change. The prevention \r\nof armed conflict must be at the core of our action. We \r\nshould make full use of Chapter VI of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, which remains underutilized. Early \r\nwarnings should be followed by early action. Resolution \r\n70/262, on sustaining peace, adopted by the Assembly \r\nearlier this year, provides a strong framework on \r\nwhich to base effective prevention and peacebuilding. \r\nWorking with and through regional organizations will \r\nmake the United Nations more effective in its quest \r\nto sustain peace. It is particularly important to find \r\nways to sustainably finance regional and subregional \r\norganizations’ peace operations.\r\nAnother area requiring determined action is \r\ngender equality. We call for a true shift in the way \r\nwe approach global efforts aimed at achieving gender \r\nequality. Ultimately, it is our task to enhance rights, \r\nrepresentation and resources for women and girls all \r\naround the world, by increasing women’s participation \r\nin peace processes, protecting them against gender-\r\nbased violence in humanitarian crises and strengthening \r\ntheir political and economic empowerment. The United \r\nNations can lead the way by improving the gender \r\nbalance in its system and having a gender-responsive \r\nbudget of its own, and by using gender-disaggregated \r\ndata when dealing with matters of peace and conflict, \r\nincluding in the Security Council.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is \r\na political road map for reform. It requires the United \r\nNations to offer comprehensive advice and support to \r\nGovernments on how to shape and develop societies \r\non issues ranging from tax reform to decent jobs. It \r\nalso requires the United Nations to monitor developed \r\ncountries, while assisting middle-income countries \r\nin their efforts to build inclusive and accountable \r\ninstitutions and sustainable prosperity.\r\nTo achieve that, we must strengthen and reform \r\nthe financing of the United Nations. All branches \r\nof its development system should make full use of \r\ntheir respective mandates and specialties, working \r\ntogether and avoiding duplication. Collaborative \r\nefforts should be rewarded. That is the only way \r\nthat the United Nations, with its limited resources, \r\nwill be able to make a greater impact at the country \r\nlevel and support the efforts of all Member States to \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). A \r\nUnited Nations conference to be co-hosted by Fiji and \r\nSweden in 2017 will focus on SDG 14, with the goal of \r\nconserving and using sustainably our oceans, seas and \r\nmarine resources.\r\nSecurity is something we must build together. It \r\nis something we share, and that notion compels us to \r\ncontest the false logic of confrontation and geopolitical \r\nzero-sum games. Instead, it can lead us to emphasize \r\nde-escalation and disarmament, mediation and \r\ndialogue, conflict prevention and peacebuilding. That \r\nis a cornerstone of Swedish security policy. It is our \r\nbasic approach to security in both our immediate and \r\nglobal neighbourhoods.\r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n54/58 16-29667\r\nIndeed, the importance of cooperation increases \r\nwith the transboundary nature of threats. Internal and \r\nexternal security are more interlinked than ever before. \r\nTherefore, we must improve our common tools for \r\ncrisis management, equip the next generation of peace \r\noperations with more robust mandates and adequate \r\nresources and strengthen cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, including \r\nthe European Union and the African Union. \r\nBut we cannot ignore the key to achieving peace: \r\npolitical will. And for peace to be sustainable, the root \r\ncauses of conflict must be tackled and the rules of \r\nour multilateral world order respected. Peace accords \r\nare not implemented, and resolutions, mandates and \r\ndecisions by the Security Council are disregarded. \r\nThis is unacceptable. It challenges the authority of \r\nthe Security Council and the rules-based international \r\norder itself.\r\nThe Middle East peace process has stalled. The \r\nparties are far apart, trust is lacking and the situation on \r\nthe ground is deteriorating. The occupation must end, \r\ninternational law must be observed and the two-State \r\nsolution must be revitalized. The Security Council has \r\na huge responsibility. Other initiatives to revive the \r\npeace process, such as the Arab Peace Initiative and \r\nthe French initiative, should be supported by all of us. \r\nSweden is honoured to lead the work on involving civil \r\nsociety in the French initiative.\r\nIn Europe, Russia’s illegal annexation of Crimea \r\nand military presence in eastern Ukraine constitute \r\nbreaches of international law and principles of the \r\nEuropean security order agreed by all participating \r\nStates of the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe. All parties must do their part so that \r\nUkraine can regain control over its internationally \r\nrecognized borders.\r\nIf we want peace, we need to plan for peace and \r\nsustain peace. This is equally critical in the vulnerable \r\naftermath of violent conflict. As more areas are \r\nliberated from Da’esh and other terrorist groups, we \r\nmust take action to win peace; we must, at the very least, \r\nmitigate and stabilize the situation in liberated areas. \r\nTo meet this challenge, our tools must be developed and \r\ncooperation enhanced.\r\nThe United Nations is central to political processes, \r\nthe delivery of immediate relief, and efforts for long-\r\nterm development, including State-building. I welcome \r\nthe fact that the United Nations is now exploring \r\nresponses for stabilization. Sweden believes that closer \r\ncooperation in this field between the United Nations \r\nand the European Union, politically and on the ground, \r\nwould be beneficial. We should be ready to provide \r\nsuch comprehensive support to Iraq.\r\nI wish to thank the General Assembly once again \r\nfor electing Sweden as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council for the 2017-2018 term. We take its \r\nstrong support as a vote of confidence for our foreign \r\npolicy of solidarity and global commitment. We also \r\nsee it as a call for a Security Council that addresses \r\nchallenges to international peace and security in a \r\ncomprehensive, inclusive and transparent manner. We \r\nare ready to assume our share of responsibility for the \r\nentire Council agenda.\r\nWe will bring our foreign policy perspectives \r\nwith us in fulfilling this assignment — those of \r\npreventing armed conflict, sustaining peace, the \r\nnecessity of including women in peace processes and \r\nan understanding of security that stresses the links \r\nto sustainable development. We will continue to talk \r\nwith, not only about, countries, and we will remain true \r\nto our principles. Swedish foreign policy rests firmly \r\non international law, respect for human rights, gender \r\nequality and a humanitarian perspective.\r\n“Today is the last day of the war.” That is what the \r\nColombian magazine Semana wrote on 23 June this year. \r\nMore than 50 years of conflict have passed. Hundreds \r\nof thousands have been killed. Millions were on the run. \r\nLet us pay our respects to the victims. Let us welcome \r\nthe peace agreement. But let us also remember what is \r\nunique about this agreement. The architects were not \r\nonly the Government and the guerrillas. Victims of the \r\nconflict, women’s organizations and civil society were \r\nalso involved. Peace does not come about because it is \r\nprinted in a headline. It happens step by step, because \r\nof the courage of ordinary people. It happens when \r\npeople organize a meeting to form a political party to \r\nvoice their demands or print a pamphlet or use social \r\nmedia to rally for their cause. It happens when women \r\nand girls claim their human rights, when civil society \r\nand trade unions grow, making societies and economies \r\nmore participatory and inclusive. Such is the fabric of \r\nlasting peace and such is the task of the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Salaheddine Mezouar, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 55/58\r\nMr. Mezouar (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, it is my pleasure to express to the President and \r\nhis friendly country our sincere congratulations on his \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-first session. I wish him every success in \r\nleading the work at this session and in bringing about \r\ntangible results with regard to all the issues on our \r\nagenda.\r\nI also want to take this opportunity to express to \r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, our sincere \r\ngratitude for the excellent manner in which he \r\nconducted the work of the previous session. I wish to \r\nexpress our deep appreciation to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for all his efforts to realize the objectives \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly coincides with \r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of the Kingdom’s membership \r\nin the United Nations. Over the past 60 years, \r\nMorocco has worked tirelessly with the international \r\nOrganization. It is committed to its objectives of \r\nstrengthening international peace and security and to \r\ndelivering the possibility of development to all peoples \r\nof the world, especially in developing countries.\r\nJoining the Organization was one of the first \r\nsovereign decisions that Morocco took after it gained \r\nits independence. It is an expression of its commitment \r\nto multilateral action as the best way to confront \r\ncomplicated crises and the increasing challenges \r\nthroughout the world, as well as its commitment to the \r\nvalues of solidarity, cooperation, freedom and peace. \r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco believes in the role of the \r\nUnited Nations as a reflection of the world’s values and \r\nthe principles of international legitimacy.\r\nEver since it joined the Organization, Morocco has \r\nworked diligently to contribute to the realization of its \r\nobjectives. In that respect, Morocco sought to adopt a \r\ndynamic approach by realigning its national priorities \r\nwith those of the United Nations.\r\nPeacemaking is a cornerstone of the activities of the \r\nUnited Nations, as reflected in its history of peaceful \r\nsettlement of international and regional conflicts and \r\nin its respect for the sovereignty, territorial integrity, \r\npolitical independence and territorial unity of States, in \r\naccordance with the principles of the Organization. As \r\na committed partner in United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations since the 1960s, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\nhas sought to contribute substantially and continuously \r\nas a demonstration of its belief in collective security \r\nand the crucial role that the United Nations plays in \r\nthat regard. Morocco has participated in peacekeeping \r\noperations in Africa, America and Asia and has \r\ncontributed more than 100,000 peacekeepers. Today, \r\nit is contributing more than 1,600 Blue Helmets to \r\npeacekeeping operations in Africa.\r\nIt is incumbent on the international community to \r\nwork for international peace and security, especially \r\nin Africa, given the connection between economic \r\nand social progress and political stability. There \r\ncan be no development without peace and security \r\nand no stability without comprehensive, sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Under the wise leadership of his Majesty \r\nKing Mohammed VI, the Kingdom of Morocco will \r\nspare no effort to strengthen United Nations initiatives \r\nto promote good governance and contain conflicts \r\nrelated to the territorial integrity of countries. To \r\nthat end, since January 2014 Morocco has chaired \r\nthe Central African Republic configuration of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission.\r\nEver since it became a Member of the United \r\nNations, the Kingdom of Morocco has sought to \r\nestablish relations of solidarity among members of \r\nthe international community both by encouraging \r\nthe constructive North-South partnership and by \r\nstrengthening South-South cooperation. These are \r\nstrategic priorities designed to realize sustainable \r\ndevelopment for the benefit of all peoples of the world. \r\nTo put the issue of sustainable development at the \r\ncentre of the work of the international community, \r\nthe Kingdom seeks to develop genuine partnerships in \r\norder to bring about sustainable human development \r\nthrough solidarity.\r\nIn that connection, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which was adopted by the General \r\nAssembly in September 2015 (resolution 70/1), is a \r\npolitical commitment through which we have agreed on \r\ncommon ground in our efforts to fulfil the aspirations \r\nof people in developing nations to live in dignity. The \r\nKingdom of Morocco emphasizes the importance \r\nof providing financing for the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda. All should do their part to implement the \r\nAgenda in an effective and appropriate manner.\r\nThe United Nations must align its work with the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), while Member States must adopt the necessary \r\nmeasures and policies to implement the Goals, and \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n56/58 16-29667\r\nvarious forms of financing should be provided to ensure \r\nthat the Goals are achieved by 2030.\r\nAs part of the effort to strengthen development at \r\nthe national level, the National Initiative for Human \r\nDevelopment, which was launched by His Majesty \r\nKing Mohammed VI in May 2005, is one of the basic \r\npillars of Morocco’s programme. It is human-centred \r\nand takes a comprehensive approach to development \r\nin that it includes political, economic, social, cultural \r\nand environmental dimensions. It has been successful \r\nin reducing poverty, vulnerability and marginalization, \r\nin developing infrastructure, and in providing health-\r\ncare services.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco has strengthened its \r\nsolidarity with African countries as a centrepiece of its \r\nforeign policy. It has sought to defend the interests of \r\nthe continent and to help it to promote development and \r\ncombat poverty. It has shared with a number of African \r\ncountries its experience in the field of social services, \r\nincluding in the areas of education, training, water, \r\nagriculture, food security, electricity and health care. \r\nIn this respect, the Kingdom of Morocco renews its call \r\non the United Nations and regional and international \r\nfinancial institutions to develop a plan for economic \r\ntransformation in Africa and to provide resources to \r\nfinance it.\r\nGiven the link between sustainable development \r\nand the environment, Morocco, which will host \r\nthe twenty-second session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, in Marrakesh in November, \r\naspires to make the session an opportunity for African \r\nvoices and those of other parts of the world that are \r\nvulnerable to the negative impacts of climate change to \r\nbe heard on an equal basis. It emphasizes its intention \r\nto make the Marrakesh session a turning point in the \r\nimplementation of the Agenda and the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change by facilitating solutions for \r\nsustainable development, as well as practical measures \r\nand structural programmes to implement the global \r\ncommitments to address climate change.\r\nMorocco wishes to emphasize that the success \r\nof the implementation of the Paris Agreement is \r\norganically and strongly linked to the provision of \r\nthe necessary financial resources. We must promote \r\naccess to financing. In that connection, the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco hopes that the Conference participants in \r\nMarrakesh will give special attention to the interests of \r\nthe countries of the South, including African countries \r\nand small island developing States, that are threatened \r\nby climate change.\r\nAt this time, Morocco, which has deposited its \r\ninstrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement, calls \r\non all other States to expedite their ratification of the \r\nAgreement so that it can enter into force as a strong \r\nexpression of the commitment of the international \r\ncommunity. Morocco seeks to include all stakeholders \r\nin the Marrakesh session so that it will ref lect our \r\nsolidarity and commitment to safeguarding the future \r\nof present and future generations.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco has placed the continent \r\nof Africa at the heart of its foreign policy and will \r\ncontinue to make every effort to promote Africa’s \r\neconomic development. With a clear vision of the \r\nfuture based on an understanding of the continent’s \r\nproblems, His Majesty King Mohammed VI is leading \r\nthe process of peace and development on the continent \r\nand launching initiatives and visiting several African \r\ncountries in order to strengthen the ties of fraternity, \r\ncooperation and solidarity among the African people. \r\nDuring his most recent speech, on 20 August, His \r\nMajesty stressed the strong link between Morocco and \r\nAfrica.He said:,\r\n“Africa, for us, is not a target. It is a commitment, \r\nbecause African people are Africans regardless \r\nof where they are and because the interests of \r\nMorocco are part of those of Africa. Our destinies \r\nwill always be intertwined. In our view, we will \r\neither achieve progress and stability together or \r\nnot at all. Africa is more than a geographical or \r\nhistorical connection. It is a commitment based \r\non love and respect, human relations and a deep-\r\nseated interest.”\r\nMorocco’s decision to return to its natural place \r\nwithin the African Union is a firm expression of its \r\ncommitment to Africa and reflects its interests. On this \r\noccasion, I wish to express our deep gratitude to the \r\nmajority of African countries for calling on Morocco to \r\nreturn to its African context. Aware of its leading role \r\nin Africa, Morocco has responded to their call and will \r\ncontinue defending African interests at all levels.\r\nSixty years after joining our strong Organization, \r\nI underscore our belief in the role of regional economic \r\ngroups. Morocco has sought to strengthen good-\r\nneighbourly relations in the African, Maghreb and \r\nMediterranean contexts. His Majesty continues to call \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.17\r\n16-29667 57/58\r\nfor a new regime in the Maghreb with influence at the \r\nregional and international levels, a regime that will \r\nguarantee peace and stability in the region, based on \r\nrespect for member States and their territorial integrity.\r\nMorocco gave earnest and responsible thought \r\nto the Security Council’s calls for a lasting political \r\nsolution through negotiation in the regional conflict \r\nover Western Sahara and responded by putting forward \r\na self-rule initiative that reflected several Security \r\nCouncil resolutions as the basis for a solution. The \r\nCouncil’s most recent resolution on the issue, resolution \r\n2285 (2016), emphasizes once again the basic aspects of \r\na political solution to this conflict, calls on all parties \r\nto be realistic and seek consensus, and appeals to all \r\nparties and neighbouring States to seek a political \r\nsolution through dialogue.\r\nMorocco reaffirms its intention to continue \r\nworking sincerely with the United Nations to find \r\na political solution through negotiations that will \r\nmaintain the unity of the Kingdom of Morocco, \r\nenable the people of its southern region to manage \r\ntheir affairs in the context of democracy, stability and \r\ncomprehensive development, and protect the northern \r\npart of the continent from the dangers of separatism, \r\nBalkanization, terrorism and extremism.\r\nThe sixtieth anniversary of Morocco’s joining the \r\nUnited Nations is a good occasion to reaffirm Morocco’s \r\nunwavering commitment to protecting human rights and \r\ndefending fundamental freedoms as part of its efforts to \r\nuphold human dignity within a united and democratic \r\ncommunity. Morocco has initiated many reforms and \r\nhas realized many achievements designed to strength \r\nhuman rights, especially in relation to women, children \r\nand young people. It has expanded individual freedoms \r\nthrough an approach that puts human rights at the \r\ncentre of human development. Morocco is working \r\nassiduously to integrate its comprehensive vision in \r\nall international forums and is playing a leading role \r\nin developing the mechanisms of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, including the universal periodic review, which \r\nMorocco was instrumental in developing.\r\nThe Kingdom has taken several initiatives with \r\nits partners in the Council to strengthen the United \r\nNations human rights system. It also hosted the second \r\nWorld Human Rights Forum, in 2014, thereby adding an \r\ninternational dimension to the Kingdom’s achievements. \r\nMorocco will spare no effort to make the noble principles \r\nof human rights a means to create friendship among \r\nnations and respect for the international community’s \r\ndiversity and to strengthen the essential values of \r\nhuman rights free from politicization.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco, as an active Member \r\nof the United Nations, has adopted a clear and \r\nfirm position with regard to international efforts \r\nto combat international terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations. The Kingdom has endeavoured \r\nearnestly, through bilateral and multilateral cooperation \r\nefforts at the regional and international levels, to \r\ncombat the phenomenon of terrorism. It reaffirms its \r\ncommitment to scrupulously respecting its obligation \r\nto ensure that no terrorist activity is launched from \r\nMoroccan territory.\r\nLast April, Morocco was among the first countries \r\nto submit a national report on the implementation of the \r\nprovisions of Security Council resolution 2253 (2015) \r\nwith regard to combating terrorism and suppressing its \r\nsources of financing. The report was very comprehensive \r\nand addressed in detail all the measures that Morocco \r\nhas taken to implement its obligations in accordance \r\nwith the resolution’s provisions. At the national level, \r\nMorocco has adopted a sound and clear-cut policy to \r\ncombat terrorism in all its forms and manifestations \r\nthrough a comprehensive and multidisciplinary \r\nstrategy, which is closely aligned with that of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is based on a religious, social, legal \r\nand security approach.\r\nIn that connection, Morocco has launched a number \r\nof initiatives, including a joint initiative with the \r\nNetherlands in the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, \r\nto combat foreign terrorist fighters. Morocco and the \r\nNetherlands, through their joint chairmanship, want to \r\nexpand the Forum at the regional and international levels \r\nand to strengthen related efforts at the international \r\nlevel. Morocco has also established the Group of \r\nFriends Against Terrorism at the United Nations, the \r\npurpose of which is to coordinate and harmonize the \r\nvarious voluntary initiatives.\r\nAt the regional level, Morocco has drawn on its \r\nexperience in undertaking religious efforts to combat \r\nterrorism at the service of fraternal and friendly \r\ncountries that wish to provide religious training to their \r\nimams to promote respect for the principles of peaceful \r\ncoexistence and tolerance. In a letter addressing \r\nthe growing ignorance of many about religion, His \r\nMajesty said that all people — Muslims, Christians \r\nand Jews — should stand as one in facing all forms \r\nA/71/PV.17 23/09/2016\r\n58/58 16-29667\r\nof terrorism, extremism and hatred. The history of \r\nhumankind shows that progress cannot be achieved \r\nin a society that is suffering from xenophobia and \r\nextremism, because those factors lead to a lack of \r\nsecurity and stability.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco firmly believes that the \r\nUnited Nations must be the lead Organization in the \r\nfight against terrorism. It emphasizes its readiness \r\nto share its experiences and good practices with its \r\npartners. Morocco is open to considering any initiative \r\nthat seeks to combat this phenomenon, bearing in mind \r\nthat suppressing terrorism is a joint responsibility \r\nshared by all Member States of the United Nations. A \r\nglobal commitment and the adoption of a cooperative \r\napproach based on bilateral and regional solidarity \r\nare needed to implement the provisions of counter-\r\nterrorism agreements.\r\nWith the same commitment, Morocco pursues \r\nits efforts in the field of mediation for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of conflicts. Accordingly, the Kingdom \r\nhosted a meeting of the Libyan parties, convened \r\nunder the auspices of the Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General and Head of the United Nations \r\nSupport Mission in Libya, which culminated in the \r\nsigning the Skhirat Political Agreement. The Kingdom, \r\nwhich supports the search for a political solution to the \r\nLibyan problem through negotiations, stresses that an \r\nend must be put to the bloodshed of innocents and that \r\nthe unity of Libya must be maintained. We call here \r\non all Libyan political stakeholders to pursue dialogue \r\nand to fully implement the Skhirat Agreement without \r\nexcluding any party. That will enable the Libyan people \r\nto realize their aspirations to stability, national unity \r\nand sustainable development in an atmosphere of \r\nfreedom, dignity and democracy, devoid of extremism \r\nand terrorism.\r\nMorocco will spare no effort in its efforts to achieve \r\npeace and stability in the Sahel and Sahara regions. As \r\na non-permanent member of the Security Council in \r\n2012 and 2013, it played a role, through the Council, in \r\ndeveloping the United Nations Integrated Strategy for \r\nthe Sahel, which seeks to strengthen good governance, \r\nsecurity and development in the region.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco considers the Palestinian \r\nissue to be a crucial problem in the Middle East and \r\nis convinced that this sensitive region cannot enjoy a \r\njust and lasting peace as long as the Palestinian people \r\nare not able to exercise their alienable right to establish \r\nan independent and viable State of Palestine, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital. Morocco expresses its concern \r\nover the fact that the Israeli-Palestinian negotiations are \r\nnot advancing as they should. It calls on the international \r\ncommunity to work more effectively and tenaciously \r\nto create the necessary conditions for a resumption of \r\ndirect negotiations between Palestine and Israel within \r\na specific time frame. The revival of the peace process \r\nmust be based on solid ground, in accordance with the \r\nprinciples of international legitimacy and previous \r\nagreements, such as the road map and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, in order to ensure the right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to establish an independent State with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe Kingdom of Morocco will remain committed \r\nto the peaceful settlement of the Palestinian question \r\nby supporting constructive initiatives that would \r\nensure the necessary conditions to realize a two-State \r\nsolution, including the French initiative, which involves \r\ncomprehensive international and Egyptian efforts with \r\na regional impact. Morocco calls on Palestine and Israel \r\nto resume negotiations.\r\nThe troubling developments affecting the Holy \r\nCity of Jerusalem, including human rights violations, \r\ncontinued settlement and forced displacement in an \r\neffort to change the legal and demographic composition \r\nof the city, represent grave violations of international \r\nlaw and international agreements. There must be an \r\nimmediate intervention to put an end to them. His \r\nMajesty the King, as Chair of the Al-Quds Committee \r\nof the Organization of the Islamic Conference, has \r\ncalled the attention of the international community to \r\nthe dangers and threats of Israel’s pursuit of its plans to \r\nchange the legal, demographic and religious character \r\nof Jerusalem. He urges the leading Powers to ensure that \r\nJerusalem remains a symbol of peaceful coexistence \r\namong all monotheistic religions.\r\nAfter 70 years of the existence of our international \r\nOrganization, today more than ever we need a strong, \r\nrenewed and effective United Nations. We must \r\ntherefore reaffirm our commitment to the principles \r\nof the Organization and to mobilizing our capacities to \r\nreform and strengthen it. The Organization is the most \r\neffective multilateral forum for seeking solutions to \r\ncontemporary problems and for bringing about a just \r\ninternational system that will ensure peace and stability \r\nfor present and future generations.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.20 p.m.\r\n"
