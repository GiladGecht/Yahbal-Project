"United Nations A/71/PV.18\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n18th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 23 September 2016, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Bouah-Kamon \r\n(Côte d’Ivoire), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.20 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President \r\nof the Republic of Mali\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Mali.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim \r\nBoubacar Keita, President of the Republic of Mali, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Keita (spoke in French): I would like to \r\nbegin by extending the hearty congratulations of the \r\ndelegation of Mali to the President on his election to \r\nlead the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, \r\nand on his outstanding stewardship of our work. I would \r\nlike to assure him of our full cooperation in those \r\nefforts. I would also like to acknowledge and commend \r\nthe excellent work of his predecessor, Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session.\r\nWe cannot but pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon as he prepares to pass the torch after 10 years \r\nentirely dedicated to the cause of humankind. History \r\nwill remember not only the Secretary-General’s efforts \r\nto resolve many conflicts throughout the world, but also \r\nhis personal involvement in the success of the summits \r\non climate change and humanitarian action, the former \r\nhaving led to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nMore particularly, I would like now, in this Hall, to \r\nthank the Secretary-General for his strong support of \r\nthe Malian people and his laudable efforts in favour of \r\npeace and stability in my country and the Sahel region.\r\nPeace and security are the conditions sine qua \r\nnon of progress and development, to which we aspire \r\non behalf of the peoples of the United Nations, whom \r\nwe have the honour of representing here. With respect \r\nto Mali, one year ago, before the General Assembly, I \r\npresented the Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation \r\nin Mali emanating from the Algiers process, which was \r\nsigned in Bamako between the Government of Mali \r\nand the armed movements in the northern region of the \r\ncountry (see A/70/PV.15). Today, 15 months later, from \r\nthis rostrum, I can assure the Assembly that hostilities \r\nhave effectively ceased between the Government \r\nand the signatory movements. To date, significant \r\nprogress has been made in the implementation of the \r\nPeace Agreement, which eloquently demonstrates my \r\nGovernment’s will to honour its commitments and has \r\ngenerated tangible progress in all areas.\r\nAt regular intervals throughout the year, when the \r\nreports of the Secretary-General on the situation in Mali \r\nare published, the Government of Mali has briefed the \r\nSecurity Council on its progress in the execution of the \r\nplan of action for implementing the Peace Agreement. \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-29673 (E)\r\n*1629673*\r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n2/25 16-29673\r\nAmong the initiatives and actions undertaken by the \r\nGovernment, I would particularly like to emphasize \r\nthose related to political and institutional reforms, as \r\nwell as to defence and security issues. Indeed, these \r\nissues and reforms are fundamental and have an impact \r\non the rest of the process.\r\nIt is also important to note the following policy and \r\ninstitutional reforms: the appointment and swearing \r\nin of governors in the new regions of Taoudenni \r\nand Ménaka, where delegated project-management \r\nagreements for construction and equipment for the \r\ntwo regions’ general administration, in the amounts \r\nof $1.7 million and $1.36 million, respectively, were \r\nsigned; and the enactment of the law establishing the \r\ninterim administrations, which followed a modification \r\nof the law codifying territorial authorities and the \r\nadoption of a decree on modalities for swearing in \r\ninterim administrations. In that connection, I would \r\nlike to mention that the timetable for the swearing in \r\nof the interim authorities, developed by the Malian \r\nGovernment in cooperation with the groups and \r\nmovements signatory to the Peace Agreement, was set \r\nfor between 15 July and 25 August 2016. Unfortunately, \r\ndue to ongoing insecurity and clashes among some \r\narmed groups, especially in Kidal, it was not possible \r\nto complete the process for the deadline. In that \r\nrespect, I emphasize that the effective implementation \r\nof Security Council resolution 2295 (2016) will allow \r\nfor the progressive recovery of Mali’s sovereignty \r\nthroughout its territory, thanks to implementation of \r\nthe Agreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali.\r\nWith respect to security and defence issues, the \r\nGovernment of Mali has established an institutional \r\nframework for reforming the security sector and for \r\nundertaking the process of disarmament, demobilization, \r\nreintegration and resettlement (DDRR). In that context, \r\namong other things, the Government decided to take \r\ncharge of the signatory groups’ combatants prior to \r\nthe launch of the DDRR process, with the attendant \r\nincrease in the budget. The Government also created \r\nan operational coordination mechanism for vehicles \r\nfor the purposes of setting up the first joint vehicle \r\npatrols. I hasten to note that, in addition to those \r\nmeasures, which aim to bring about a return to lasting \r\npeace and the restoration of State authority throughout \r\nthe national territory, the Government has continued \r\nits development activities on the ground, in places \r\nwhere the security conditions allowed it, through the \r\nimplementation of sector projects and programmes.\r\nIt should also be noted that the effective \r\nimplementation of the Peace Agreement requires us to \r\nmobilize external resources to support national efforts. \r\nIn that regard, I thank the partners that have honoured \r\ntheir financial commitments to Mali, and I would \r\nreiterate the call of my Government to the technical and \r\nfinancial partners to release the resources pledged at the \r\ninternational conference for the economic recovery and \r\ndevelopment of Mali, held in Paris on 22 October 2015.\r\nDespite the efforts by the signatories to the Peace \r\nAgreement, the peace process still faces serious \r\nchallenges related to the activities of terrorist groups \r\nin the northern regions that are indiscriminately \r\nexpanding their asymmetrical attacks against peaceful \r\ncivilians, the Malian defence and security forces, and \r\nthe troops of the United Nations Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in Mali (MINUSMA) \r\nand of the French-led Operation Barkhane. I reiterate \r\nmy gratitude to the Security Council for the adoption \r\nof resolution 2295 (2016), which renewed MINUSMA’s \r\nmandate and authorized, inter alia, the adoption of a \r\nmore proactive and robust posture so as to fulfil its \r\nstabilization mandate in Mali.\r\nI call for strengthening the operational capabilities \r\nof the deployed troops in order to ensure the safety \r\nand security of MINUSMA personnel and apply the \r\ninnovations set forth in resolution 2295 (2016) on the \r\nground. I would also stress the need to accelerate the \r\nprocess of cantonment and DDRR, aimed at isolating \r\nthe armed groups that are not signatories to the Peace \r\nAgreement that are affiliated with terrorist networks \r\nwhose actions undermine ongoing efforts.\r\nFor its part, the Government of Mali will fully \r\nassume its responsibility under the new mandate. The \r\nGovernment is already working with MINUSMA to \r\nswiftly arrive at a shared vision of the implementation \r\nof the mandate by establishing measurable benchmarks. \r\nAccordingly, I welcome the agreement among all the \r\nstakeholders participating in high-level meeting on \r\nMali held this morning concerning the importance of \r\naccelerating the implementation of the Peace Agreement, \r\nin particular the imperative of correcting the remaining \r\ngaps in MINUSMA’s operational capabilities.\r\nI cannot end this part of my address without \r\nexpressing once again the sincere thanks and profound \r\ngratitude of the people of Mali for the United Nations \r\nand its Member States in providing multifaceted support \r\nfor the peace process in Mali since January 2012. On \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 3/25\r\nbehalf of a grateful Malian nation, I would also like to \r\npay tribute to the memory of all of the victims, both \r\ncivilian and military, Malian and foreign, who have \r\nfallen on the field of honour in Mali in the defence of \r\nhuman dignity, freedom and democracy.\r\nIt is difficult to imagine the eradication of poverty \r\nand keeping our promise to leave no one behind in \r\na context where armed conflict has become a new \r\nnormal. The proliferation of attacks perpetrated around \r\nthe world is a sufficient reminder that no country is \r\nimmune to terrorism and that there is no cause that \r\njustifies deliberate violence against innocent civilians. \r\nMali, which unfortunately continues to suffer the \r\nhorrors of terrorism, encourages and joins Member \r\nStates in their shared efforts to neutralize the hydra of \r\nterrorism and its avatars, including Da’esh, Al-Qaida \r\nin the Islamic Maghreb, Boko Haram, Ansar Eddine, \r\nthe Movement for Unity and Jihad in Western Africa \r\nand Al-Mourabitoun, especially in the Middle East \r\nand Africa.\r\nThe Malian delegation welcomes the choice of the \r\ntheme of this session — “The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals: a universal push to transform our world”. As the \r\nfirst session of the Assembly since the adoption of 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development by the Heads of \r\nState and Government, the seventy-first session will \r\nundoubtedly allow us to take stock of a full year of efforts \r\nto implement the Agenda, by conducting a thorough \r\nanalysis of the difficulties met with a view to finding \r\nthe best ways and means to ensure the achievement of \r\nthe 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The \r\nSDGs, which build on the success of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, exhort us to go further and faster, \r\nif we want to put an end to all forms of poverty and \r\nchange the lives of people in a substantial and inclusive \r\nmanner by 2030.\r\nWe in Mali are convinced of the need to adopt \r\nstrategies that strengthen economic growth and \r\nrespond to the vital needs of the population, including \r\ncombating climate change, protecting the environment \r\nand providing education, health care, social protection \r\nand jobs for young people, while also empowering \r\nwomen and ensuring their involvement and that of \r\nyoung people in the management of critical issues \r\nrelating to the socioeconomic development of the \r\ncountry. In that context, we have adopted a law setting \r\naside 30 per cent of elective positions for women. \r\nThe adoption of that law will undoubtedly contribute \r\nto increasing the participation of women in national \r\ninstitutions. In addition to other equally important \r\nmeasures, the development of the strategic framework \r\nfor economic recovery and sustainable development for \r\nthe period 2016-2018 will serve, in the medium term, as \r\nthe sole reference point for the design, implementation \r\nand monitoring of different development policies and \r\nstrategies at a sectoral level.\r\nClimate change is one of the major challenges \r\naffecting the survival and development of humankind. \r\nAs a prime example of a country of the Sahel, Mali \r\nis bearing the brunt of the effects of climate change. \r\nThat is why the delegation of Mali welcomes the strong \r\ncommitment on the part of the international community \r\nin adopting and signing the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, which marks a decisive turning point in the \r\npreservation of the environment. In that regard, I am \r\nparticularly pleased to announce that this very morning \r\nMali deposited its instruments of ratification for the \r\nParis Agreement, the implementation of which I am \r\nconvinced will contribute to saving our environment.\r\nNow more than ever, it is high time that the recourse \r\nto weapons and deadly conflicts give way to the \r\nimperative of dialogue in order to establish lasting peace \r\nthroughout the world. In Africa, despite the remarkable \r\nprogress that has been made in the promotion of peace \r\nand security — particularly in Liberia, Sierra Leone, \r\nGuinea-Bissau and Côte d’Ivoire — the fact remains \r\nthat the situations in Libya and South Sudan continue \r\nto be of major concern. In the Middle East, we are \r\nfollowing with the utmost concern the developments \r\nin the situations in Syria, Turkey and Iraq — and we \r\nreaffirm our strong condemnation of terrorism in all its \r\nforms and manifestations.\r\nOn the question of Palestine, which has been at \r\nthe heart of United Nations concerns for more than 70 \r\nyears, Mali reiterates its call for a two-State solution, \r\nwith Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace \r\nand security. I take this opportunity to reiterate that \r\nthe people and the Government of Mali extend their \r\nsolidarity and full support to their brother people \r\nin Palestine in their legitimate fight to exercise their \r\ninalienable right to sovereignty.\r\nI would like to conclude by reminding the Assembly \r\nthat it is our primary responsibility as world leaders to \r\nprovide the necessary impetus to transform the planet \r\nand to ensure sustainable and inclusive development \r\nfor future generations so as to safeguard them from the \r\nscourge of war and misery. Millions of men, women \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n4/25 16-29673\r\nand children are impatiently waiting for us, scanning \r\nthe horizon with hope. We have no right to disappoint \r\nthem. To that end, Mali is determined to play its role \r\nto the full extent of its abilities. Long live the United \r\nNations at the service of a world for peace and justice.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Mali for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Ibrahim Boubacar Keita, President of the \r\nRepublic of Mali, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe \r\nMasisi, Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nBotswana\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Botswana.\r\nMr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Botswana, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have great \r\npleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Mokgweetsi \r\nEric Keabetswe Masisi, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Botswana, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Masisi (Botswana): On behalf of His \r\nExcellency the President of the Republic of Botswana, \r\nLieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama, allow \r\nme to join previous speakers in congratulating His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. I also pay homage to his predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft.\r\nMy delegation fully endorses the pertinent choice \r\nof theme for this session, namely, “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”. We are aware of the need for and importance of \r\nreviewing, monitoring and evaluating the progress made \r\nin the implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals over the next 15 years, which has been one of the \r\nmain lessons learned from the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nBotswana has long recognized that, in order to \r\nachieve sustainable development, there must be national \r\nownership. It must be based on inclusive, accountable, \r\ndemocratic and strong institutions and processes. For \r\nBotswana, adherence to those principles, together with \r\nthe judicious exploitation of natural resources and \r\ninternational development support, has enabled us to \r\nachieve what we have achieved in the 50 years since \r\nour independence.\r\nIn a week, on 30 September, Botswana will celebrate \r\nits fiftieth anniversary of independence. I would once \r\nagain like to remind the Assembly that in 1966 we were \r\namong the poorest nations of the world, with a gross \r\ndomestic product per capita of approximately $70. Since \r\nthen we have managed to attain middle-income status.\r\nWhen we, like the rest of Africa, told the world \r\nthat we were ready for self-governance, many sceptics, \r\nhistorians and commentators — including many in \r\nAfrica — thought of us as a basket case that was neither \r\nready for, nor capable of, real independence. In fact, \r\non 28 September 1966, two days before we joined the \r\ncommunity of sovereign nations, one cynical Canadian \r\njournalist, a certain Mr. Charles King of the Southern \r\nNews Service, wrote an article entitled “Bechuanaland \r\nPoor, Hungry Desert Land, Independence to Come \r\nFriday”, observing that\r\n“The new blue, white and black f lags are f lying \r\neverywhere in Gaberones, its incongruous capital \r\ncity. But elsewhere in the vast, trackless wasteland \r\nthat will take the name of Botswana there is little \r\nto celebrate.”\r\nHe continued:\r\n“Two years of disastrous drought and crop \r\nfailure have brought havoc and hunger to its widely \r\nscattered agricultural inhabitants. More than one \r\nfifth of the population is literally being kept alive \r\nby emergency feeding, and the numbers are rapidly \r\nincreasing ...\r\n“It also has debts and economic misery. It is \r\ndestined to be an international charity case forever, \r\nexporting its ablest men and its cattle in exchange \r\nfor cash and kindness from abroad.”\r\nWith about 3 kilometres of paved roads in the entire \r\ncountry, with 42 graduates, a few primary schools, a \r\nsingle railway line, operated by neighbouring hostile \r\nand white-minority-ruled then-Rhodesia, and one \r\nnational radio station, which broadcast for two hours a \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 5/25\r\nday, ours is a country born out of humble beginnings, \r\nfrom which we managed our own development. Having \r\njoined the United Nations in 1966, together with Lesotho, \r\nGuyana and Barbados, we are proud and contented to \r\nlook back on the experiment we started and see that it \r\nwas well worth the try. From next to nothing, we placed \r\na high premium on building a united, democratic and \r\naccountable nation premised on respect for democracy, \r\nhuman rights, the rule of law and strong institutions.\r\nConscious of the prevailing circumstances and \r\nchallenges, we chose to base the development of our \r\nsociety on four key national development principles, \r\nthat is, democracy, development, unity and self-\r\nreliance. As we reflect on our challenges and the modest \r\nachievements that we have made, we are proud of the \r\nfact that we are among Africa’s most stable democracies, \r\nhaving held free, fair and peaceful multiparty elections \r\nevery five years without interruption. It is our every \r\nintention to continue along that path.\r\nIn celebrating 50 years of independent nationhood, \r\nwe are conscious of the fact that we could not have \r\nachieved all those milestones without the much-needed \r\nsupport and solidarity of the international community. \r\nFor that we shall forever remain grateful to our reliable \r\nglobal partners, who have stood with us throughout the \r\nchallenging journey. We have today made great strides \r\nand achievements in the areas of education, health \r\ncare, infrastructure and human-resource development, \r\nas well as women and youth empowerment. Those \r\nachievements, however, should not make us complacent.\r\nLike many nations, Botswana is already feeling \r\nthe adverse impact of climate change. Such impact \r\nis manifested in a decline in agricultural production, \r\nrising food insecurity and increasing water stress, all \r\nof which are projected to worsen with time. The threat \r\nmust not be underestimated. Urgent and effective global \r\naction on climate change, mitigation and adaptation \r\nis required to avoid the catastrophic consequences \r\nof global warming. The seventy-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly provides a strategic opportunity for \r\ninjecting much needed-political momentum into the \r\neffective implementation of the 2030 Agenda, which \r\nthis organ unanimously adopted exactly one year ago.\r\nThe recent high-level event on large movements of \r\nrefugees and migrants, held just a few days ago, is a \r\nstark reminder of the challenges we continue to face \r\nas a planet. While we commend all States that take on \r\nthe burden of receiving displaced people, that is not the \r\nonly answer. More effort should be put into addressing \r\nthe problem and finding solutions in the countries \r\nfrom which they come. Clearly, the current situation of \r\nreceiving such people serves only to encourage others \r\nto follow their predecessors.\r\nAs a member of the community of nations that \r\ncherishes freedom, peace and the fulfilment and \r\nenjoyment of life, Botswana remains deeply concerned \r\nabout the many acts of terror, conflict and human \r\nsuffering that have precipitated the vast and large \r\ndisplacement of people across the globe. In that regard, \r\nwe are concerned about the protracted Syrian crisis, \r\nwhich could have been contained had the Security \r\nCouncil and the international community intervened \r\npromptly. History will judge us harshly, for we have \r\nallowed the situation to degenerate into what it is today. \r\nHowever, we are well aware that Al-Assad, as well as \r\nhis system, which slaughters the innocent, is not the \r\nonly party committing crimes against humanity.\r\nWe are equally concerned about, and strongly \r\ncondemn, the continued blatant contravention of \r\ninternational law and United Nations resolutions by \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea through \r\nits callous testing of ballistic missiles. To demonstrate \r\nour abhorrence, Botswana terminated its diplomatic \r\nrelations with that rogue State. In fact, in our opinion, \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea and Syria \r\ndo not deserve membership of this world body, owing \r\nto their lack of respect for, and adherence to, the values \r\nand principles that they committed to uphold.\r\nAs a community of nations bound by universal \r\nideals and a shared moral ethos, it would be a \r\ndereliction of our responsibilities if we did not hold \r\none another accountable in the event of breaches of \r\nthe very fundamental values of human rights that the \r\nOrganization is committed to uphold. In the light of the \r\nincreasing security threats, we call upon the Security \r\nCouncil, as the organ responsible for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, to demonstrate \r\nseriousness in executing that important mandate. It can \r\nno longer be acceptable to hide behind the veto while \r\nmillions of innocent lives are lost.\r\nWe continue to express our sympathies to those \r\naff licted by disasters such as earthquakes, f loods and \r\nother natural calamities. We extend our condolences to \r\nthe families of all those who lost their lives in the past \r\nyear. In that regard, we wish to commend civil society \r\nfor its tireless efforts in providing humanitarian aid \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n6/25 16-29673\r\nto those in dire need. In the same vein, we reiterate \r\nour long-held belief, which is shared by many, and in \r\nline with the hallowed principle of the responsibility \r\nto protect, that States have the primary responsibility \r\nto protect their own populations from genocide, ethnic \r\ncleansing, war crimes and crimes against humanity. \r\nWe commend human rights organizations’ work in \r\nexposing such violations wherever they occur in the \r\nworld.\r\nAs a staunch supporter of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, we stand by all efforts to fight impunity and \r\nstrengthen the international criminal justice system \r\nin order to bring justice to the victims of such crimes. \r\nWe urge all States signatories of the Rome Statute to \r\nuphold their commitments.\r\nIt is crucial that we step up our efforts in the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 1325 \r\n(2000) in order to effectively protect women and \r\nchildren in armed conflict and involve them at all \r\nlevels and processes of mediation, peacekeeping, peace \r\nmaintenance, reconstruction and development, given \r\nthe fact that they suffer most from the effects of armed \r\nconflict. As a peace-loving nation, Botswana reaffirms \r\nits abiding faith in the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, as well as the \r\nvarious multilateral instruments under international \r\nhumanitarian law, including the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights.\r\nLet me conclude by commending Brazil for hosting \r\na successful Olympic Games despite criticisms in some \r\nquarters that predicted failure while disseminating \r\nmessages of fear linking the Games with the issues \r\nof, inter alia, the zika virus and terrorism. In a \r\nrelated matter, we strongly condemn the International \r\nParalympic Committee for its blanket ban of Russian \r\nathletes. Botswana does not condone doping in any \r\nway, but to punish clean athletes is discrimination. \r\nThose who participate in the Paralympic Games are \r\ndisabled, and the Games are a way of including them \r\nin the mainstream and helping them overcome their \r\nchallenges. For a body that was set up specifically to \r\nshow compassion and caring to treat people like that \r\nis indeed a gross injustice. We believe that there is an \r\nagenda beyond its stated reasons for doing so.\r\nI wish to reaffirm Botswana’s continued \r\ncommitment to playing its full part in the quest for \r\ninternational peace and security, as well as to the \r\ninternational community’s unrelenting efforts to make \r\nthe world a safer and more prosperous place for both \r\npresent and future generations.\r\nFinally, as we are in the United States of America, \r\nwe wish the people of America successful elections \r\nin November. We hope that the person who emerges \r\nvictorious will be someone who is known to be tolerant \r\nand who embraces all people. Allow me, in the same \r\nbreath, to return in equal measure the accolades \r\nextended to us by President Obama. We in Botswana \r\nfully recognize, remain confident in and exalt the \r\nleadership of President Obama. These indeed have been \r\neight glorious years — the best years for the United \r\nStates of America and Africa by any measure. We wish \r\nhim well and a well-deserved retirement.\r\nIn the spirit of the Charter, and as inspired by \r\nthe 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, let us push to transform our world and leave no \r\none behind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Botswana for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mokgweetsi Eric Keabetswe Masisi, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Botswana, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Indonesia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of Indonesia.\r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Kalla (Indonesia): I wish to congratulate \r\nMr. Peter Thomson on his assumption of the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nHe may rest assured of Indonesia’s commitment to \r\ncontributing to his successful tenure at the helm of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe theme of the general debate — “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 7/25\r\nworld” — is appropriate as we move forward with our \r\nshared commitment to maintaining and building on \r\nthe momentum that we achieved last year. Indonesia \r\nattaches great priority to the issue of development, \r\nparticularly sustainable development. Through the \r\ncommitments and the setting of global targets in the \r\nMillenium Development Goals (MDGs), the world has \r\nmade considerable progress in achieving development \r\nfor all. The MDGs have been an important guide for \r\ncountries to eradicate poverty. The time frame for their \r\nrealization added a much-needed sense of urgency for \r\nthe global community.\r\nToday we have a new set of global goals and \r\ntime frames. The transformative 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development is a comprehensive global \r\nframework for sustainable development for us at the \r\nnational level and for the international community to \r\nact as one. The issues the Agenda addresses are broader \r\nthan those covered by the MDGs. The Agenda reflects \r\nthe challenges faced by countries at a national level, \r\nwhile simultaneously committing the international \r\ncommunity to addressing global challenges.\r\nIndonesia is fully committed to implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda. We have taken concrete measures such \r\nas mainstreaming the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) into our national development plan; finalizing \r\nlegal and institutional frameworks for national \r\nimplementation, while engaging all stakeholders, \r\nincluding local Governments, academia, civil-society \r\nand philanthropic organizations; and developing \r\nnational and sub-national action plan guidelines, \r\nthe SDGs database and monitoring, evaluation and \r\nreporting mechanisms.\r\nHowever, the implementation of the MDGs had \r\ntaught us an important lesson, namely, that national \r\ncommitments need to be complemented by strong and \r\nrobust international cooperation. In that regard, the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda must be supported \r\nby organizing a strong global partnership, one that makes \r\na transformative difference to the efforts to advance \r\nsustainable development. The global community must \r\nalso provide sufficient means for the implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals. Such means \r\ninclude stable and predictable funding mechanisms and \r\ninnovative approaches for financing development.\r\nIf we are to achieve our 2030 Agenda, we need \r\nan enabling environment. I am sure that we are all \r\nfamiliar with the phrase “peace is a prerequisite \r\nfor development”. Basically, the phrase means that \r\nwithout peace, security and stability there can be no \r\ndevelopment. From our experience in the 1950s and \r\n1960s, Indonesia can attest to the statement’s veracity. \r\nInternal conflict and regional strife with our neighbours \r\nturned Indonesia’s focus away from development.\r\nToday we are seeing much of the same in many \r\nparts of the world. A lack of peace, security and \r\nstability have resulted in far too many of our brothers \r\nand sisters having to struggle for their basic survival, \r\nsometimes in unimaginable and inhumane conditions. \r\nIncreased tension between countries and unresolved \r\nterritorial disputes, if left unrestrained, all increase the \r\nrisk of open conflicts.\r\nReal and constant threats from terrorism, \r\nextremism and radicalism continue to haunt us. A \r\ndivisive “us versus them” mindset is giving rise to racial \r\nprejudice, stigmatization and religious intolerance. The \r\nlong list of non-traditional challenges that profoundly \r\naffect humankind continues to grow, ranging from \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing to drug \r\ntrafficking, and from people smuggling and trafficking \r\nto cybercrime.\r\nIn addition, we continue to helplessly watch \r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian people. Despite the \r\noverwhelming support for a two-State solution, the \r\nMiddle East peace process remains resistant to moving \r\ninto gear. Unprecedented humanitarian challenges, such \r\nas the phenomenon of refugees and irregular migration, \r\nresulting from the situation in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and \r\nother parts of the world, continue. Almost daily, we \r\nmust confront a 24-hour news cycle, with the networks \r\npresenting us with images of world’s stark reality — the \r\nblood, tears and vacant stares of the most vulnerable, \r\nour children.\r\nAll of that is taking place against the backdrop \r\nof a slowing global economy. The World Bank has \r\ndowngraded the global economic growth forecast \r\nfrom 2.9 per cent to 2.4 per cent. The gap between \r\nrich and poor is increasingly widening. At the same \r\ntime, environmental degradation and climate change \r\ncontinue to accelerate, directly affecting island States \r\nand the most vulnerable countries.\r\nAll those critical challenges must be seen for what \r\nthey are — global and massive challenges. In the face \r\nof these great challenges, it is our commitment and \r\nour efforts that will prevail. No one country or region \r\nalone can resolve these challenges. What we need \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n8/25 16-29673\r\nare global solutions, global partnerships and global \r\nsolidarity. More than ever before, we need the United \r\nNations — an Organization that is at the centre of our \r\nglobal governance, an Organization that is transparent, \r\neffective, accountable, efficient and representative.\r\nIn that regard, United Nations reform is key to \r\nmaking the Organization stronger and more relevant to \r\nconfronting the challenges and reality of the twenty-\r\nfirst century, and to eliminating the silo mentality that \r\ncharacterizes the way in which the Secretariat carries \r\nout its work. There have been too many important \r\nplayers left out of the United Nations decision-making \r\nprocesses, too many instances where the principles of \r\ndemocracy are put aside. Too often the decisions made \r\nat the United Nations differ from what is needed on the \r\nground. We need to mainstream the SDGs and their \r\nrelated targets, as well as such universal principles \r\nas human rights, in all activities and work of the \r\ncommittees, agencies and related bodies within the \r\nUnited Nations system. Most important, Member States \r\nmust also adapt to the new realities and challenges \r\nfacing the Organization. We need to embrace new \r\nmethods of work that would safeguard such important \r\ntargets as the successful implementation of the SDGs.\r\nIndonesia is a true advocate of multilateralism. It \r\nis inherent in our DNA, in the founding of our nation \r\nand in our Constitution. We are a nation with the \r\nworld’s fourth-largest population and its largest Muslim \r\npopulation. We are also the world’s third-largest \r\ndemocracy. Ours is a country where democracy, Islam, \r\nmodernity and the empowerment of women go hand in \r\nhand. We are at the forefront of promoting democracy, \r\ntolerance, pluralism and peace.\r\nOur nation is made up of thousands of islands, \r\nboth large and small, and therefore we fully understand \r\nthe impacts of climate change. Most important, ours \r\nis a nation that respects and fully adheres to the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations in its \r\nforeign relations. Those traits have allowed Indonesia \r\nto play a contributing role in various United Nations \r\ncollective efforts.\r\nIn the areas of peace and security, Indonesia remains \r\nsteadfastly committed to increasing its contribution \r\nto United Nations peacekeeping, with a target of \r\nproviding 4,000 personnel by 2019. Our “Roadmap \r\nVision 4,000 Peacekeepers” initiative has motivated \r\nus to work unflaggingly to strengthen United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations, while we remain mindful of \r\nthe fact that contributions to peacekeeping operations \r\nare not merely about numbers. Indonesia’s cooperation \r\nand efforts in countering terrorism have also been \r\nenhanced both regionally and globally.\r\nWe continue to demonstrate our pioneering role \r\nin combating climate change through mitigation and \r\nadaptation efforts and in addressing ocean and maritime \r\nissues. We signed the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange and are on schedule to conclude the ratification \r\nprocess in due course. Indonesia is also committed \r\nto the global efforts to promote and protect human \r\nrights. At the regional level, we continue to maintain \r\nstability and prosperity through active regional \r\ncooperation, as demonstrated by our participation in \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, as well \r\nas through knowledge-sharing in our South-South and \r\ntriangular cooperation.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, allow me to take this \r\nopportunity to announce Indonesia’s candidature for \r\na non-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nperiod 2019-2020. Indonesia’s practices, commitment \r\nand contribution to the United Nations make it a true \r\npartner for world peace. Indonesia recognizes that our \r\njourney to 2030 may not always be smooth sailing. \r\nAddressing the realities of our world today cannot \r\nwait for perfect conditions. We must strengthen our \r\ncommitment to ramping up concrete efforts aimed \r\nat creating an environment conducive to widespread \r\nprogress, thereby ensuring a better tomorrow.\r\nLasting peace is not merely a goal — it is the \r\ndetermining factor for meaningful development. \r\nIndonesia remains steadfast in its commitment to being \r\nat the forefront of global partnerships for world peace \r\nand prosperity for all. We will always endeavour to \r\nspearhead efforts to work together towards creating \r\na stronger, more representative and democratic \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Indonesia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 9/25\r\nAddress by Mr. Taban Deng Gai, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of South Sudan.\r\nMr. Taban Deng Gai, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Taban \r\nDeng Gai, Vice-President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Gai (South Sudan): I bring to the General \r\nAssembly greetings from my President, General Salva \r\nKiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, who would have loved to be here but who, \r\nowing to other national commitments, has asked me \r\nto represent him at the seventy-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. Allow me to congratulate Mr. Peter \r\nThomson on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. I also want to \r\ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for \r\na job well done.\r\nMore important, I wish to pay tribute and extend \r\nmy appreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his global achievements and for his interest in, and \r\nattention to, South Sudan. In my culture, a white bull is \r\na symbol of peace. South Sudanese President Salva Kiir \r\nMayardit once gave His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon \r\na white bull as a gesture of peace. The bull has now \r\ngrown enough to be ready for delivery to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, to whom we wish all the best in his future \r\nendeavours.\r\nEvery year we try to remind ourselves of the \r\ncardinal principle of global peace. Although the theme \r\nof this year’s debate is “The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals: a universal push to transform our world”, we \r\nstill understand that without peace we will not be \r\nable to achieve that noble objective. Indeed, we need \r\nto transform our world in order to collectively and \r\nspecifically respond to the many challenges that we \r\nare facing today. Bringing human suffering to an end \r\nand ensuring that human dignity for all is achieved and \r\nrespected around the world are noble goals that we must \r\nall strive to attain.\r\nMy country, South Sudan, which was admitted \r\nto the General Assembly five years ago, in July 2011, \r\nhas once again descended into conflict. Today South \r\nSudan has been struck by civil war because we, the \r\nleaders of the country, have failed to agree on how \r\nto address the internal challenges of governance \r\nand leadership within our political party, the Sudan \r\nPeople’s Liberation Movement (SPLM). After nearly \r\ntwo years of protracted fighting, we were able to reach \r\na decision and sign the Agreement on the Resolution \r\nof the Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan, in \r\nAugust 2015, which we are currently and steadily \r\nimplementing, with support from our region’s regional \r\nbody, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \r\n(IGAD), as well as the African Union (AU), the Troika \r\ncountries — the United States of America, the United \r\nKingdom and Norway — the European Union (EU), \r\nChina and the rest of the world.\r\nHowever, in the course of implementing the \r\nAgreement, one of our leaders, the former Chairman \r\nof the Sudan People’s Liberation Army-In Opposition \r\n(SPLA-IO), triggered renewed fighting on 7 to 11 July, \r\nwhich brought about new instability. This time the \r\nfighting took place inside the presidential palace itself, \r\nwith the primary objective of taking power by force. \r\nFortunately, the SPLA-IO forces were defeated in the \r\nensuing battles, and their leader decided to f lee from \r\nJuba and abandon the process of implementing the \r\nAugust 2015 peace agreement signed in Addis Ababa. \r\nThis man has resorted to fighting the very Government \r\nhe served as first Vice-President.\r\nAfter this departure, our party, the SPLA-IO, which \r\nis the leading party to the agreement, met and agreed \r\nto replace him as a leader of SPLA-In Opposition. The \r\nofficial leadership of the SPLA-IO took that decision \r\nafter having established that the position of the first \r\nVice-President was vacant and that it was not an option \r\nfor the country and the people to go back to war. It \r\ntook this decision in order to allow peace and stability \r\nto prevail in the country, as well as for the SPLA-IO \r\nto have a partner in the implementation of the peace \r\nagreement. To that end, a new leader for SPLA-IO \r\nwas elected. Accordingly, I am here representing my \r\ncountry as its first Vice-President. We are determined \r\nthis time — more than before — to move our country \r\nforward in peace and development with a view to \r\naverting the suffering of our people.\r\nAt this point, I would like to express our sincere \r\ngratitude to the United Nations for the humanitarian \r\nassistance it has rendered, and continues to render, to \r\nour people. I would like also to thank IGAD, the AU, \r\nthe troika, the United Nations, the EU and China for \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n10/25 16-29673\r\ntheir tireless efforts in ensuring that an agreement was \r\nreached to end the conflict and return South Sudan to a \r\npeaceful and stable path.\r\nAt the moment, I can report to the members of \r\nthe Assembly with confidence that the situation in \r\nmy country is stable and peaceful, my Government \r\nis functioning and life is returning to normal. The \r\nTransitional National Legislative Assembly is \r\noperational. Furthermore, it has been reconstituted and \r\nis continuing with its work, and cantonment areas for \r\narmies have been established. However, the effect of the \r\nconflict, coupled with the low global oil prices, has put \r\nour economy under unprecedented fiscal stress, thus \r\ncreating hardship for the general public. Nevertheless, \r\ntogether with our development partners and friends, we \r\nare making every effort to address the economic shocks \r\nby stabilizing the security situation, streamlining our \r\nfiscal policies, improving income from non-oil revenue, \r\nengaging in agricultural, mining, tourism, including \r\necotourism, activities, and encouraging investors to \r\ncome to South Sudan.\r\nAnother important milestone is that South Sudan \r\nand the Sudan are now moving quickly to ensure the \r\nreconciliation of the two States and that their relations \r\nare normalized, so that the two States are able to better \r\nserve their citizens. There shall be no more harbouring \r\nof negative forces from either country. The Sudan \r\nand South Sudan are also working closely with other \r\ncountries in our region — especially Ethiopia, Kenya \r\nand Uganda — to realize the vision of sustainable \r\ndevelopment by building infrastructure, such as power \r\ngrids and roads, in order to improve the lives of citizens.\r\nMore often than not, we have taken decisions \r\nindividually, and sometimes collectively, to try to \r\naddress such situations as preventing a country from \r\nslipping into conflict, while urging reforms and \r\ndemocratization, promoting respect for human rights \r\nand so on. But sometimes the results of such actions \r\nmay actually contribute to the very things we were \r\ntrying to avoid in the first place.\r\nSome leaders who may not agree with those efforts \r\nassert that those actions are unhelpful. The point I am \r\ntrying to make in this regard is that efforts in some of \r\nour countries, which we are taken with the supposed \r\nintention of protecting civilians, advancing democracy \r\nand promoting respect for human rights and justice, \r\nhave not always produced the intended results. Rather, \r\nin most cases, we end up causing displacement and \r\nrefugees. I have the inclination to believe that our \r\nproblem as a global Organization is that we have in \r\nmany cases failed or refused to listen to views from \r\nthe countries whose peoples’ lives we want to improve.\r\nThe universal push to transform the world through \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals cannot be achieved \r\nwithout us listening to one another — whether we are \r\nlarge nations or small, whether we are rich countries \r\nor poor, developed nations or developing ones, like \r\nmine, South Sudan. What happens in one part of the \r\nworld affects other parts of the world. Therefore, it is \r\nimperative that we work together to resolve critical \r\nissues that affect our planet, such as, inter alia, \r\nterrorism, conflicts, migration, climate change, nuclear \r\nproliferation, racism and food insecurity. These issues \r\nrequire collective and cooperative action if we are to \r\nmake the world a better place for all of us. If we want to \r\ntransform our world, then all of us must be made to feel \r\nthat we all belong to it, as a matter of right and obligation, \r\nand we must work as true partners in its transformation. \r\nThe attitudes of superiority and patronage, disguised as \r\npromoting democracy, human rights and freedom and \r\njustice, can easily lead to serious crises in the form of \r\nresistance from affected parties.\r\nWe in South Sudan believe in dialogue and respect \r\nfor each other as we engage in resolving problems. And \r\nas the Security Council continues to strive to maintain \r\nworld peace and order, as provided for in Articles \r\n23 and 24 of the Charter of the United Nations, we \r\nin South Sudan want to be active participants in the \r\nachievement of these noble goals. We want peace in \r\nSouth Sudan and the world at large, not only for the \r\npresent generation but also for future generations. Our \r\nactions as individual countries or as States Members of \r\nthe United Nations should therefore be seen to promote \r\npeace, and not create more conflicts. In our recent \r\nhistory, our actions have created more suffering than it \r\nhas solved problems. That should not be the case if we \r\nwant to be true to the ideals and principles set forth in \r\nthe United Nations Charter.\r\nI want to assure the Assembly that our Government \r\nhas consented to Security Council resolution 2304 \r\n(2016). The resolution’s implementation is being \r\ndiscussed by the United Nations Mission in the Republic \r\nof South Sudan (UNMISS), the South Sudanese \r\nTransitional Government of National Unity and other \r\ncountries in the region. My Government’s position is \r\nthat we have to engage more with the United Nations on \r\nthe details of the resolution’s implementation in order \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 11/25\r\nto avoid derailing national healing and reconciliation. \r\nExternal intervention often negatively affects internal \r\nreconciliation. The tasks of the Regional Protection \r\nForce can be advanced through collaboration and \r\ncooperation with the Transitional Government.\r\nLast but not least, the Republic of South Sudan will \r\ncooperate with UNMISS, regional bodies, IGAD, the \r\nEast African Community, the AU, the troika, the EU and \r\nall of our friends in our journey towards recovery from \r\nthe tragedy that befell us. We promise to bring peace and \r\njustice and to rebuild strong and credible institutions in \r\nour country. It is our plan to move the country forward \r\non its major development projects — roads and bridges, \r\nnew cities, power grids, education and health — and in \r\nmodernizing agriculture, so that we can feed our people. \r\nWe are going to commit our endowed resources of oil, \r\nminerals, human capital and others to the development \r\nof the youngest nation in the world. We call upon \r\nour partners for support, cooperation, consultation \r\nand dialogue as we partner together in transforming \r\nour world through the attainment of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals by 2030.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Taban Deng Gai, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Moisés Omar Halleslevens \r\nAcevedo, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Nicaragua\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Vice \r\nPresident of the Republic of Nicaragua.\r\nMr. Moisés Omar Halleslevens Acevedo, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Nicaragua, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Moisés \r\nOmar Halleslevens Acevedo, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Nicaragua, and inviting him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nMr. Acevedo (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nbring greetings from the people of Nicaragua and from \r\nour President, Comandante Daniel Ortega Saavedra. \r\nWe are very pleased to see a brother from Fiji, a Pacific \r\nisland State, preside over the General Assembly for the \r\nvery first time. He can count on Nicaragua’s support.\r\nA year ago, the international community agreed to \r\nlaunch the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich offers us a historic opportunity to transform our \r\nplanet and fight for a just world order so that together, \r\nin peace, solidarity and complementarity, we may \r\nadvocate for the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nEndemic poverty and inequality have become \r\nmore noticeable than ever in developing and developed \r\ncountries alike, especially in vulnerable and \r\nmarginalized groups, including peoples living under \r\ncolonial occupation and foreign intervention. It is \r\nurgent that we eradicate colonialism and end military \r\ninterventions and aggressions in order to fully realize \r\nthe right of our peoples to self-determination and \r\ndevelopment.\r\nThe right to development is a right of all. The \r\ninternational community has yet to answer for the \r\nmillions of human beings to whom that right remains a \r\ndream. Developed countries must comply once and for all \r\nwith their commitments regarding official development \r\nassistance by providing additional, predictable and \r\nsufficient financial resources. Nicaragua recognizes the \r\nneed to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that \r\nprovide equal access to social justice based on respect \r\nfor human rights, including the right to development.\r\nMuch has been said in recent days about climate \r\nchange. The World Meteorological Organization \r\nprojects that 2016 is heading towards breaking all \r\ntemperature records since records have been kept, \r\nwhich makes it clear that the agreements reached at the \r\ntwenty-first session of the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (COP21) in Paris failed \r\nto establish a firm starting point to address the greatest \r\nchallenge facing the planet. The voluntary, non-binding \r\nformula will lead to an increase in global temperature \r\nof 3°C or more, which will have catastrophic effects on \r\nhighly vulnerable countries.\r\nMany of us feel that what was agreed in Paris is not \r\nsufficient ,and we urge more ambitious actions. We note \r\nwith great concern the worldwide record temperatures \r\nand little ambition to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, \r\nwhich corroborates Nicaragua position’s at COP21. \r\nNicaragua, adhering to international law and taking \r\ninto account the principle of damage recovery, has \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n12/25 16-29673\r\ndemanded a global compensation policy in order to \r\naddress that phenomenon.\r\nWe take this opportunity to reiterate our support for \r\nthe just aspirations of the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\nfor greater participation in United Nations specialized \r\nagencies, in accordance with the demands and needs of \r\nthat brotherly nation of 23 million inhabitants, which \r\nshould not be excluded from the Organization.\r\nWe in Latin America and the Caribbean have \r\nreiterated our desire to assert ourselves as a zone of \r\npeace and fair development in order to achieve firm \r\nand lasting peace and social justice through dialogue \r\nand understanding. We are pleased at and welcome the \r\nrestoration of relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates of America. However, it is disappointing to \r\nnote the intensification of measures that maintain the \r\ncruel, inhuman and criminal economic, financial and \r\ncommercial blockade against Cuba.\r\nWe reiterate our congratulations to the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela on having recently assumed \r\nthe leadership of the Non-Aligned Movement. In that \r\nvein, we offer our full support to President Nicolas \r\nMaduro Moros and his legitimate Government, which \r\ncontinues to be the victim of aggression, assault and \r\ndestabilizing policies from the exterior, coordinated \r\nwith anti-democratic and oligarchic sectors from the \r\npast.\r\nWe once again hail the signing of the peace \r\nagreements in Colombia between the Government and \r\nthe Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia, \r\nand offer our best wishes for the peace agreements to \r\nprevail and be implemented.\r\nPuerto Rico is Latin American and Caribbean. We \r\ndemand that the colonial Power resolve this situation \r\nthrough dialogue and negotiation. We call on the United \r\nStates of America to release the Puerto Rican patriot \r\nOscar López Rivera as a humanitarian gesture.\r\nWe express our solidarity and support for the \r\nlegitimate rights of the Argentine Republic in the \r\nsovereignty dispute over the Malvinas Islands, South \r\nGeorgia Islands, South Sandwich Islands and the \r\nsurrounding maritime areas. The United Kingdom \r\nmust immediately comply with the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions and resume direct negotiations with \r\nArgentina.\r\nWe reiterate our solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople in their just struggle for an independent State, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital. We demand the \r\nimmediate return of all Arab and Palestinian territories \r\ncurrently occupied by Israel. \r\nWe welcome and resolve to maintain our solidarity \r\nwith the people of Western Sahara in their fight under \r\nthe leadership of the Polisario Front.\r\nWe reiterate our full solidarity with the Government \r\nand people of Syria in their fight against international \r\nterrorism in defence of their sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity. We stress the need for a political solution \r\nnegotiated among Syrians and an end to foreign \r\nintervention, including the funding and delivery of \r\nweapons to terrorist groups. It has pained us to witness \r\nthe proliferation of terrorist attacks against peoples and \r\nGovernments. We condemn terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations. \r\nNicaragua will always promote its policy of peace, \r\nunity and understanding among nations, for political and \r\nnegotiated solutions to conflicts and for the right of our \r\npeoples to achieve sustainable development and well-\r\nbeing. As current holder of the presidency pro tempore \r\nof the Central American Integration System, we are \r\nreinforcing our integration in all fields and working \r\ntogether to combat the scourge of drug trafficking \r\nand organized crime. Together with El Salvador and \r\nHonduras, we are striving to make the Gulf of Fonseca \r\na zone of peace and development.\r\nWe highlight the need to eradicate threats to civic \r\nsecurity and social order in our region with a strong \r\nand coordinated strategy against organized crime \r\nand its ramifications. In Nicaragua, our policies are \r\nfocused on the human individual and the Nicaraguan \r\nfamily. Our people are ratifying their confidence in our \r\nsocialist Christian model of solidarity, which ensures \r\nthat our lives continue to improve in a safe and stable \r\nmanner, in growth and in peace with our people as \r\nprincipal actors. Through good governance, we have \r\nprioritized economic growth, job growth, the reduction \r\nof poverty and inequality, the strengthening of gender \r\nequality and macroeconomic stability in sovereignity \r\nand security in harmony with the Earth. \r\nNicaragua has been recognized by the World \r\nEconomic Forum as one of the most successful \r\ncountries in terms of gender equality and as the safest \r\ncountry in Central America and one of the safest in \r\nLatin America. As one of the three safest countries \r\nfor investment, we have sustained economic growth of \r\napproximately 5 per cent of our gross domestic product \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 13/25\r\nin the past five years. We have achieved this success \r\nthrough a model of partnership, dialogue and consensus \r\nunder the leadership of our Government, working with \r\nthe private sector and the workers themselves. \r\nWe reject the proposals and initiatives put forth by \r\nthe House of Representatives and Senate of the United \r\nStates, as they constitute violations of international law \r\nand a breach of the Charter of the United Nations. Those \r\nlegislative bodies have been involved in interventionist \r\npolicy throughout history and interfered in our own \r\nsovereign political, economic and social processes. \r\nThis interference is notably more intense in the election \r\nseason.\r\nWe in Nicaragua shall continue to strengthen peace, \r\nstability, governability and progress through such \r\nunprecedented proposals as our model of partnership, \r\ndialogue and consensus, which enjoys constitutional \r\nstatus and has helped us to mobilize the economy and \r\nachieve important progress in the fight against poverty. \r\nThe National Reconciliation and Unity Government \r\nreiterates its firm commitment to this model, which \r\nunites us around the common good and reaffirms our \r\nunwavering commitment to peace, security, tranquility \r\nand democracy. In the weeks prior to our general \r\nelections, our people have demonstrated their support \r\nwith high approval ratings and willingness to participate \r\nin the elections of 6 November with confidence and \r\nhope. \r\nNicaragua will continue to fight for a better world \r\nof values, where human beings strive for a sustainable, \r\njust, equitative, safe and sovereign development; and \r\nwhere the advances of science and technology, reflected \r\nin all areas of our lives, are accessible and shared by \r\nall. We will be able to make our world a better one \r\nonly once we ourselves assume, along with family and \r\nsociety, a steadfast commitment to peace and equality \r\namong nations and their respective societies.\r\nI conclude by declaring my hope that peace may \r\nprevail. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Nicaragua for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Moisés Omar Halleslevens Acevedo, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Nicaragua, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Prime \r\nMinister of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.\r\nMr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Prime Minister of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Prime Minister of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sisoulith (Lao People’s Democratic Republic) \r\n(spoke in Lao; English interpretation provided by the \r\ndelegation): First, on behalf of the delegation of the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic, I extend my sincere \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson \r\non his election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-first session. It is my firm belief that, with \r\nhis wealth of experience, he will guide this session of \r\nthe General Assembly with great success. We stand \r\nready to offer him our full support and cooperation in \r\nthe discharge of his noble duties.\r\nMy profound congratulations also go to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft on the successful \r\ncompletion of his duties as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. \r\nI also take this opportunity to commend His \r\nExcellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on his \r\nactive and tireless efforts to fulfil the United Nations \r\nmission and objectives on many fronts over the past \r\ndecade.\r\nThe international community remains concerned \r\nabout various challenges and developments in many \r\nregions of the world. To name but a few, terrorism and \r\nextremism remain a threat to regional and global peace \r\nand security; more than 800 million people all over \r\nthe world still live in extreme poverty; while natural \r\ndisasters and climate change have inflicted tremendous \r\ndamage on social and economic development in various \r\nparts of the world. At the same time, the global economy \r\nis still fragile and growing only slowly. \r\nAgainst that backdrop, in recent years the \r\ninternational community has made collective efforts \r\nto respond to and address those challenges by \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n14/25 16-29673\r\nadopting various measures and mechanisms, including \r\ncooperation frameworks such as the Sendai Framework \r\nfor Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda for financing sustainable development, \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and the Programmes of \r\nAction for the least-developed countries, landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries and small island developing \r\nStates.\r\nIn that regard, I am of the view that it is imperative \r\nfor us to be resolute in translating our political \r\ncommitment into concrete action, while enhancing \r\nmutual trust, cooperation and assistance in order to \r\ncollectively address our challenges. We must continue \r\nto adhere to the fundamental principles of the United \r\nNations in resolving regional and international conflicts \r\nby peaceful means, while promoting development \r\ncooperation with a focus on implementing the 2030 \r\nAgenda. At the same time, the United Nations, which \r\nhas a duty to encourage and assist Member States \r\nin implementing such measures, should improve \r\nits mechanisms and working methods to enable it \r\nto respond to challenges and carry out those duties \r\neffectively.\r\nSouth-East Asia continues to enjoy peace and \r\nstability, making for an environment that is conducive not \r\nonly to the socioeconomic development of the countries \r\nof the region but also to enhancing regional cooperation \r\nin the new era of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) Community — post-31 December \r\n2015 — as well as strengthening cooperation between \r\nASEAN and its external partners, with the aim of \r\nfurther consolidating and advancing the ASEAN \r\nCommunity in accordance with its Vision 2025 \r\ninitiative through our ASEAN-initiated frameworks. \r\nWe hope that the international community, particularly \r\nASEAN’s dialogue partners and other external parties, \r\nwill continue to support ASEAN and its central position \r\nin the evolving regional architecture.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic is proud \r\nand honoured to assume the chairship of ASEAN in \r\n2016, the first year of the ASEAN Community. In that \r\nspirit, we have introduced the theme “Turning vision \r\ninto reality for a dynamic ASEAN Community”, aimed \r\nat realizing Vision 2025. The ASEAN summits, and \r\nthe related summits concluded earlier this month, \r\nhave adopted many important documents related to \r\ncooperation within ASEAN and between ASEAN \r\nand its external partners. All of that has contributed \r\nsignificantly to our common cause of maintaining \r\nand promoting peace, stability and cooperation in the \r\nregion and the world at large, as well as of achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic takes this opportunity \r\nto express its sincere thanks and appreciation to the \r\ninternational community, particularly the ASEAN \r\nmember States and dialogue partners, for the kind \r\ncooperation and support they have given our ASEAN \r\nchairship this year.\r\nThis has been the first year of the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nincluding the Sustainable Development Goals. In that \r\nregard, I would commend the President on his choice \r\nfor this session of the Assembly of the theme “The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push to \r\ntransform our world”, a theme that responds to our real \r\nsituation. I believe that we have to deepen understanding \r\nof the SDGs at the national, regional and international \r\nlevels in order to integrate them into our national \r\ndevelopment plans and mobilize sufficient resources \r\nfor effectively implementing the 2030 Agenda. We must \r\nalso ensure a peaceful, stable environment, which is a \r\nshared aspiration for humankind and consistent with \r\nthe United Nations principles of peace, friendship and \r\ndevelopment cooperation, aimed at ensuring that we, \r\nthe peoples, live together in peace and dignity.\r\nEarly this year, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic held elections to the National Assembly, \r\nwhich subsequently approved a new Government. \r\nThe Government has continued to pursue our policies \r\non national development and has mainstreamed the \r\nSDGs into its eighth five-year national socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment plan for 2016 to 2020, its development \r\nstrategy for 2025 and Vision 2030. We consider \r\nimplementation of the SDGs to be an international \r\nobligation that will not only contribute to realizing the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development but will \r\nalso bring development benefits to the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic. To that end, our Government is \r\nfocusing on achieving the goals of the aforementioned \r\ndevelopment initiatives, which include, among other \r\nthings, working on green growth and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, maintaining steady economic growth, \r\ncontinuing to reduce poverty and graduating from \r\nleast-developed-country status.\r\nIn addition to the 17 SDGs, the Lao Government \r\nhas adopted a national, eighteenth SDG — keeping \r\nlives safe from unexploded ordnance (UXO). I myself, \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 15/25\r\ntogether with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, formally \r\nlaunched the SDG on 7 September in Vientiane. Its \r\ntargets are to ensure that residual UXO activities are \r\nundertaken by 2030 and all known UXO contamination \r\nis cleared in high-priority areas and all villages defined \r\nas poor; that annual casualties from UXO accidents are \r\neliminated as far as possible; and that the needs of all \r\nidentified UXO survivors and victims are met.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic is a least-\r\ndeveloped and landlocked country that continues to \r\nface many challenges and obstacles in developing \r\ninfrastructure and quality human resources, among other \r\nthings, that require the continued support and assistance \r\nof the international community. I am confident that with \r\nthe Lao Government’s determination, coupled with the \r\ninternational community’s continued cooperation and \r\nassistance, we will be able to achieve those goals.\r\nClimate change and more frequent and severe \r\nnatural disasters have affected the national development \r\nand livelihoods of peoples all over the world. That poses \r\na major challenge that no single country alone is able to \r\naddress. Recognizing the importance of this issue, the \r\nGovernment of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nhas formally joined the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. I very much hope that the Paris Agreement \r\nwill enter into force by the end of this year and will \r\nbe effectively implemented. For its part, the Lao \r\nGovernment has submitted its nationally determined \r\ncontributions and integrated climate change, natural \r\ndisaster risk reduction and management into its national \r\nsocioeconomic development plan.\r\nLessons from the past have shown that the use of \r\narmed forces to resolve conflicts, which occurred in \r\ndifferent regions of the world, brings only enormous \r\ndevastation to humankind, such as great losses in lives \r\nand property, resulting in poverty, hunger and other \r\nnegative impacts. This leads to an escalation of crimes \r\nand terrorist attacks. Against that backdrop, the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic calls on the international \r\ncommunity to demonstrate the political will to address \r\nconflicts in various parts of the world by peaceful \r\nmeans, which the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nhas consistently supported.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic always \r\nhopes that the parties concerned will resolve the issue \r\nof Palestine by peaceful means, with a view to creating \r\ntwo independent States, Palestine and Israel, living side \r\nby side in peace.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes \r\nthe re-establishment of diplomatic relations between \r\nthe United States of America and the Republic of Cuba, \r\nand expresses its strong hope that such relations will be \r\nfurther enhanced, leading to the lifting of the embargo \r\nagainst the Republic of Cuba in the near future.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that the United \r\nNations must be further strengthened, especially in \r\nterms of its effectiveness in addressing important \r\nglobal issues. All States Members of the United Nations \r\nshould extend full support and cooperation and fulfil \r\ntheir international obligations in order to address \r\nthese enormous global challenges, and in particular to \r\nimplement the SDGs in a timely and effective manner. \r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic reiterates \r\nits firm commitment and determination to continue \r\nworking closely with the international community to \r\nbuild a more secure, peaceful, just and prosperous \r\nworld.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thongloun Sisoulith, Prime Minister of the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrew Holness, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Defence, Economic \r\nGrowth and Job Creation of Jamaica\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Defence, Economic Growth \r\nand Job Creation of Jamaica.\r\nMr. Andrew Holness, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof Defence, Economic Growth and Job Creation of \r\nJamaica, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Andrew \r\nHolness, Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, \r\nEconomic Growth and Job Creation of Jamaica, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Holness (Jamaica): I am honoured to join fellow \r\nleaders at the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession, which affords us an opportunity to undertake \r\nthe most effective global response to the challenges for \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n16/25 16-29673\r\nwhich the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nwas elaborated.\r\nI congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption \r\nof the presidency for this session, and am particularly \r\npleased that the representative of a small island \r\ndeveloping State is presiding over our Assembly. I am \r\nconfident that his deliberations during this session will \r\ntranslate into meaningful commitments and actions \r\nunder his able leadership. \r\nLet me thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncontribution to the work of the United Nations over \r\nthe past 10 years. He is to be commended for his \r\ntireless efforts in guiding the Organization, allowing \r\nit to remain at the forefront of international dialogue, \r\nconsensus-building and cooperation.\r\nWith the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in September last year, we, as a global \r\ncommunity, have committed ourselves to securing the \r\nwell-being of all peoples. Jamaica is mindful, however, \r\nthat for this outcome to be realized, national efforts \r\nmust be complemented by global partnerships. Indeed, \r\nwe are conscious that transforming our world is the \r\nresponsibility of all of us — of every nation and every \r\nindividual. Under my leadership, despite the challenges, \r\nwe in Jamaica are fully committed and are laying the \r\nfoundation for accelerated, sustained economic growth.\r\nLike many other countries, our path towards \r\nsustainable development has been hindered by years \r\nof low growth, crippling national debt and high \r\nunemployment, which have been exacerbated by our \r\nvulnerability to natural hazards and other exogenous \r\nshocks. Consistent with the priorities of Vision 2030 \r\nJamaica and the global Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nmy Government is implementing strategies to achieve \r\neconomic growth, job creation, security and poverty \r\nalleviation. Those are our overriding objectives for the \r\nnext four years. We are forging stronger partnerships \r\nwith our private sector and undertaking structural \r\nreforms to foster an enabling business environment, \r\nwhich will make Jamaica a more attractive destination \r\nfor local and foreign direct investment. We are also \r\nresolute in our commitment to ensuring that economic \r\nactivity is undertaken in a manner that not only protects \r\nand preserves our natural environment, but that also \r\ndevelops our most important asset — the people of \r\nJamaica. We will also continue to develop a social \r\nprotection network that is essential to safeguarding the \r\nwelfare of the most vulnerable in our society.\r\nWhile we pursue a self-reliant path, I must bring \r\nto the attention of the General Assembly a matter that \r\nrequires international cooperation. Highly indebted \r\nmiddle-income countries (HIMIC) like Jamaica are \r\npoised for economic transition with the attainment of \r\nrelatively high levels of health and education. However, \r\nin a climate of historically low economic growth, this \r\npotential is gravely threatened by our having to choose \r\nbetween debt repayment and catalytic growth spending.\r\nJamaica has no choice. Jamaica must repay its \r\ndebts, and we are repaying our debts. However, the \r\nconsequence of this is that no resources are available for \r\nthe Government to make the kinds of public investment \r\nthat stimulate economic growth. In addition, spending \r\non critical issues, such as security — the absence of \r\nwhich negatively impacts growth — is compromised. \r\nIn these circumstances, developing countries would \r\npreviously be able to tap into development assistance \r\nthat can be used for growth-inducing countercyclical \r\ninvestment in infrastructure, which in turn strengthens \r\ndebt-repayment capacity. However, arbitrary \r\nclassification, on the basis of gross domestic product \r\n(GDP) per capita, precludes HIMIC countries from \r\naccessing such resources. The problem is that while \r\nGDP per capita gives an indication of average incomes, \r\nit says nothing about a country’s stock of wealth, nor \r\ndoes it take into account the vulnerabilities that some \r\ncountries face.\r\nFurthermore, some HIMIC countries such as \r\nJamaica have made deep structural and fiscal reforms \r\nto improve fiscal management and achieve debt \r\nsustainability, ensuring that we will never return to \r\nunsustainably high levels of debt. However, in the \r\nabsence of an abundance of unused spare capacity in our \r\neconomies, these reforms will not immediately kick-\r\nstart the growth cycle. Instead, new investment needs \r\nto follow at a scale and velocity that are difficult to \r\nundertake without the full engagement of international \r\ndevelopment institutions. This creates the prospect \r\nof a HIMIC trap — a situation where countries are at \r\nthe cusp of transitioning but are stalled and at risk of \r\nreversal. \r\nThe presumption that middle-income country \r\nstatus obviates the need for ongoing access to official \r\ndevelopment assistance and concessional financing \r\nis not supported by empirical evidence. The potential \r\nHIMIC trap threatens hard-won development gains \r\nand countries such as ours have for some time been \r\nhighlighting this problem. Yet the prospect of a HIMIC \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 17/25\r\ntrap has not yet triggered a change in the mindset of \r\nthose who preside over the decision-making process \r\nthat directly influences our global, economic and \r\nfinancial outlook. I re-emphasize that a review of this \r\nbroad categorization of countries, based solely on GDP \r\nper capita, must be undertaken, as this measure, in \r\nisolation, fails to fully and accurately take account of \r\nadded vulnerabilities and levels of indebtedness. There \r\nare various other measures of development that should \r\nbe taken into account.\r\nSeveral years ago, the international community \r\nnobly responded to the problem of unsustainable debt \r\nin poor countries through the Heavily Indebted Poor \r\nCountries Debt Initiative, guided by the principle that \r\nno poor country should face a debt burden that it cannot \r\nmanage. We supported this then, and we support it now \r\non a similar principle for highly indebted middle-income \r\ncountries. \r\nHowever, the time has come for the international \r\ncommunity to similarly converge around a HIMIC \r\ninitiative, underpinned by the principle that highly \r\nindebted countries that have undiversifiable structural \r\nvulnerabilities, such as small size or susceptibility to \r\nthe effects of climate change, and that responsibly and \r\nfaithfully service their debt should be facilitated with \r\nassistance in the form of investment, favourable trade, \r\ntechnology transfer, security cooperation and energy.\r\nTo qualify for inclusion in the HIMIC initiative, \r\na country, in addition to being a highly indebted \r\nmiddle-income country, should have undiversifiable \r\nstructural vulnerabilities and a demonstrated track \r\nrecord of commitment to economic, fiscal and social \r\nreform programmes supported by the International \r\nMonetary Fund and the World Bank. The collective \r\nsize of the problem is such that a HIMIC initiative \r\nwould not burden the international system. However, \r\nthe potential impact of assisting these countries in \r\ntransitioning would put more countries in a position to \r\nmake greater contributions to the international system \r\nin the near future.\r\nJamaica is pursuing reforms to enhance the \r\nefficiency of the public sector, improving its customer \r\nservice delivery, pursuing economies of scale, \r\nreducing duplication and aligning the public sector \r\ntowards enabling and facilitating economic growth \r\nand development. While we pursue reforms aimed at \r\nboosting fiscal sustainability and growth, we are also \r\nlooking at innovative ways to match our financing \r\nneeds with sustainable development objectives.\r\nJamaica will work with development partners to \r\npursue debt-for-climate-change swaps. This holds the \r\npotential of providing bilateral and multilateral relief \r\nfor climate change adaptation and mitigation initiatives. \r\nSuch a mechanism has the potential to provide fiscal \r\nrelief while helping to unlock pledged climate financing \r\nto fund adaptation and mitigation initiatives. As a \r\ncountry vulnerable to climate, Jamaica will play its part \r\nto close the climate implementation gap, while at the \r\nsame time addressing our debt overhang. This has the \r\npotential to be a ground-breaking approach.\r\nPeace and security are a Sustainable Development \r\nGoal. They is often spoken about in the context of \r\npeace between States. However, peace within States is \r\njust as important. Jamaica, like much of the Caribbean \r\nand Central America, is challenged by crime. This has \r\nhad a destructive impact on families — particularly \r\npoor families — deterred investment and discouraged \r\nbusinesses. In sections of Jamaica crime threatens the \r\nattainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nTackling crime is a priority for our Government. While \r\nthe Jamaican Government will do its part, the common \r\nproblem we face in our region requires deeper security \r\ncooperation.\r\nThe international community must also move with \r\ngreater alacrity towards eradicating the illicit trade \r\nin small arms and light weapons. Jamaica is acutely \r\naware of the destruction that can be wrought as a \r\nresult of easy access to small arms and light weapons, \r\nparticularly when in the possession of sophisticated \r\nnetworks of organized criminal groups. Our strategic \r\nlocation, which is extremely favourable for trade and \r\nlogistics, also provides a potential transit point for \r\nillicit activities. \r\nIt is this reality that has defined and propelled \r\nour participation in a range of bilateral, regional and \r\nmultilateral arrangements aimed at restricting the \r\nsource, means and capabilities that have fuelled these \r\ndangerous relationships, made even more destructive \r\nthrough links to the drug trade. Jamaica has been a \r\nstaunch supporter of the Arms Trade Treaty, and we are \r\nworking towards its full and effective implementation. \r\nWe call on all arms-exporting countries to abide by \r\ntheir legally binding obligations under the Treaty. \r\nJamaica was honoured to have chaired the recently \r\nconvened Sixth Biennial Meeting of States to consider \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n18/25 16-29673\r\nthe Implementation of the Programme of Action to \r\nPrevent, Combat and Eradicate the Illicit Trade in Small \r\nArms and Light Weapons in All its Aspects. \r\nWe need to effectively address the emerging crisis \r\nof the withdrawal of correspondent banking services \r\nfrom certain financial institutions in the Caribbean. \r\nDe-risking threatens our economies. It tends to hinder \r\nour participation in the global financial system and \r\nin international trade, which in turn creates serious \r\nobstacles to our efforts to promote investment. We \r\nrespect and have been complying with financial \r\nregulatory standards and working within a rules-\r\nbased, multilateral trade and financial system. Trade \r\nrepresents 70 per cent of the Jamaican economy and \r\nde-risking measures therefore threaten our integration \r\nand economic viability. We therefore encourage \r\nour international partners to take an approach \r\nthat establishes principles for ensuring inclusive \r\ndevelopment strategies based on a country’s ability to \r\nengage in vibrant, dynamic international trade.\r\nIn the area of global trade, Jamaica realizes that the \r\ncontinued economic embargo of our sister Caribbean \r\ncountry, Cuba, is out of step with the recent actions \r\nthat have been taken to re-establish diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States. We therefore urge \r\nthat it be lifted as soon as possible.\r\nThe hallmark of any civilized society is how it treats \r\nits most vulnerable members. We must address the \r\nissue of preventing violence against them, particularly \r\nour women and children, as a priority. We must seek \r\nto empower our women to realize their full potential. \r\nJamaica has a long track record of championing the \r\nrights of women and will continue to advocate for full \r\nimplementation of the Beijing Declaration and Platform \r\nfor Action. Nor can we leave our children behind. If they \r\nare to realize their full potential, they must be given \r\nthe opportunity to live in an environment that is free \r\nfrom fear and violence. That resolve is what undergirds \r\nour support for the Global Partnership to End Violence \r\nagainst Children.\r\nThe international community must scale up \r\ncooperation in order to respond to the growing and \r\ndeepening health crises that have gripped our world. \r\nJamaica, like many other countries, continues to \r\nstruggle with preventing and controlling the common \r\nrisk factors associated with the prevalence of \r\nnon-communicable and new and emerging diseases. \r\nThe emerging and resurgent epidemics associated with \r\nthe transnational movement of microbes such as Ebola, \r\nZika and chikungunya represent a severe challenge for \r\nnational budgets. The recently concluded high-level \r\nmeeting on antimicrobial resistance and HIV/AIDS \r\nalso highlighted another problem for the global health \r\nsituation that must be halted if we are to ensure that our \r\ncitizens have full and productive lives.\r\nAnother issue that demands continued cooperation \r\nat the global, regional and national levels is our \r\nresponse to climate change and the increasing \r\noccurrence of natural disasters, including extreme \r\nweather-related phenomena. Such events, increasingly \r\nspurred by man-made activity, continue to be a clear \r\nand present danger for many societies, particularly \r\nsmall island developing States. Recent experience has \r\nshown us that no country or group of countries can be \r\nconsidered to be beyond the reach of such events. The \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change, under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nand the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction \r\nprovide us with a blueprint for action to ensure that our \r\ndevelopment efforts do not compromise the ability of \r\nfuture generations to enjoy a world in which their needs \r\ncan be adequately met. I can assure the Assembly that \r\nJamaica remains committed to the implementation of \r\nthose agreements and will work to continue the effective \r\nimplementation of the commitments they contain.\r\nAs the host country for the International Seabed \r\nAuthority, we attach great importance to matters \r\npertaining to the law of the sea. Jamaica supports \r\nthe development of a legally binding international \r\ninstrument on the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biological diversity in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction, and is actively participating in the \r\nnegotiations on such an instrument.\r\nJamaica has had a long and fruitful association \r\nwith the United Nations that we value greatly. We are \r\nfirm in our commitment to multilateralism and the \r\ncontinued strengthening of the Organization. We stand \r\non the threshold of a world of possibilities, a world in \r\nwhich all can be given the opportunity to realize their \r\nfull potential and where every nation State can better \r\nprovide for the well-being of its citizens. We must \r\nnot just live up to that expectation; we must surpass \r\nit. At this seventy-first session of the Assembly, let us \r\nrecommit to the noble ideals of this Organization and its \r\nCharter, and to achieving the goals of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. Let us join together, in \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 19/25\r\nthe spirit of the national pledge of Jamaica, to advance \r\nthe welfare of the whole human race.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister of Defence, Economic Growth \r\nand Job Creation of Jamaica for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Andrew Holness, Prime Minister and Minister \r\nof Defence, Economic Growth and Job Creation of \r\nJamaica, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime \r\nMinister of Solomon Islands\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of Solomon \r\nIslands, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sogavare (Solomon Islands): At this seventy-\r\nfirst session, it is indeed an honour to see a fellow \r\nPacific islander elected for the first time as President \r\nof the General Assembly. Mr. Peter Thomson brings \r\nto the position qualities of experience, personality and \r\nleadership that are known in this Hall. Solomon Islands \r\nwould like to assure him of our support and cooperation \r\nduring his term in office, and we look forward to \r\nworking with him on our common agenda as one of his \r\nVice-Presidents.\r\nOur appreciation goes to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, whose term in office \r\ncoincided with the adoptions of three development \r\nframeworks — the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and their Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. President Lykketoft \r\nworked tirelessly to strengthen the role and authority \r\nof the General Assembly. He put in place an open, \r\ninclusive and transparent process for selecting the \r\nSecretary-General, and our new Secretary-General is \r\nexpected to take up office in January 2017. For the first \r\ntime in 70 years, I believe, the Assembly interacted \r\nwith all the candidates for the position. We wish all of \r\nthem the best in their bid for the position and leave an \r\nopen invitation to the incoming Secretary-General to \r\nconsider visiting the Hapi Isles.\r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon’s tenure as Secretary-General \r\ncomes to a close at the end of this year. We join others \r\nin paying tribute to his exemplary leadership of our \r\nOrganization. Over the years, he has worked for the \r\nbenefit of all and has been a voice of reason, particularly \r\non the issue of climate change. He remains the first and \r\nonly Secretary-General to visit Solomon Islands since \r\nwe joined this body 38 years ago. It was also during \r\nhis tenure that the United Nations country presence \r\nin Solomon Islands was upgraded. We have every \r\nconfidence that his successor can further upgrade that \r\npresence to the status of a full-f ledged country office. \r\nWe remain steadfast in our commitment to working \r\nwith the Secretary-General during the remaining four \r\nmonths of his term and thank him for his sterling \r\nservice to Solomon Islands and humankind.\r\nLast year was one of agreements and the adoption \r\nof frameworks; this year must be about operationalizing \r\nthe agreements and implementing the frameworks. In \r\nthat regard, Solomon Islands welcomes the theme of \r\nthis session, “The Sustainable Development Goals: a \r\nuniversal push to transform our world”. We commend the \r\nPresident for putting together an SDG implementation \r\nteam in his Office and look forward to working with \r\nhim on unlocking the means of implementation so \r\nas to realize full and effective implementation of the \r\nSDGs. I am indeed proud to say that Solomon Islands \r\nhas begun the work of domesticating the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals by integrating them into our \r\nnational development strategy for 2016 to 2035, which \r\nprovides a clear, coherent and harmonized whole-of-\r\nGovernment approach to delivering on our national \r\npolicies and programmes.\r\nThe high-level meetings held this week to address \r\nthe issue of large movements of refugees and migrants \r\nwere also an opportunity to seriously examine the issue \r\nof climate-displaced populations and environmental \r\nmigrants. The international community must do more \r\nby establishing a global mechanism to help small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) manage populations displaced \r\nby climate change. The treaties in effect are inadequate \r\nto addressing the issue of people forced out by climate \r\nchange. We call for a legal framework designed \r\nto address and protect the rights of forced climate \r\nmigrants and to compensate populations affected by \r\nclimate change for the loss of their livelihoods.\r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n20/25 16-29673\r\nSolomon Islands is the current Chair of the Pacific \r\nIslands Development Forum (PIDF), which is a bold \r\nattempt to address the issues of sustainable development \r\nthrough a structured and inclusive approach, under the \r\ntripartite leadership of Government, the private sector \r\nand civil society. The PIDF offers the Pacific island \r\ncountries a seamless link to the high-level political \r\nforum processes envisaged under “The future we want”.\r\nSolomon Islands welcomes the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, and I would like to congratulate \r\nthe French presidency of the 2015 Paris Climate \r\nConference for its leadership in helping to restore trust \r\nand confidence in the multilateral system. We now have \r\nthe Paris Agreement, with legally binding obligations \r\nto implement the 1992 United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). I am \r\npleased to announce that Solomon Islands has ratified \r\nthe Agreement and submitted its instrument of \r\nratification two days ago. We are all duty-bound to \r\nstrengthen the Agreement and make it work. \r\nHowever, we remain concerned about the fact that \r\nambitions under the Paris Agreement remain alarmingly \r\nlow if we are to limit warming to well below 1.5°C above \r\npre-industrial levels. We appeal to developed countries \r\nto scale up the ambition of their intended nationally \r\ndetermined contributions so as to protect the integrity \r\nof the Paris Agreement. We hope that in Marrakech we \r\nwill be able to do more to establish the Agreement on \r\nfirmer foundations by taking concrete steps to close \r\nthe pre-2020 ambition gap. We therefore urge countries \r\nthat have not ratified the Doha Amendment to the Kyoto \r\nProtocol to do so as soon as possible.\r\nI also welcome the decision taken in December by \r\nthe parties to the Montreal Protocol to phase down the \r\nproduction and consumption of hydrofluorocarbons \r\nunder the treaty. We hope that big emitters and industrial \r\ncountries will see the urgency of preventing runaway \r\nclimate change and will ratify the Paris Agreement to \r\nenable its entry into force as soon as possible.\r\nThis year, scientists reported that five of our \r\nislands had been claimed by the sea as a result of \r\nhuman-induced sea-level rise, while six others were \r\nseverely eroded. Accelerating sea-level rise and ocean \r\nacidification continue to be serious concerns for us. \r\nDelaying action on tackling climate change comes at a \r\ncost, and we in the SIDS and least-developed countries \r\nare unnecessarily put in harm’s way by the lack of \r\ncommitment on the part of some.\r\nSolomon Islands welcomes and supports the \r\ninitiative of the Moroccan presidency of the twenty-\r\nsecond session of the Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe UNFCCC in convening a facilitative dialogue \r\non unlocking the means of implementation to \r\noperationalize the Paris Agreement. We also welcome \r\nthe decision of the Green Climate Fund to disburse \r\n$2.5 billion by December 2016. Solomon Islands is in \r\nthe midst of securing financing from the Fund for one of \r\nour hydropower projects. We continue to be grateful to \r\npartners such as Japan, the United Arab Emirates, Italy \r\nand the Republic of China for their ongoing renewable \r\nenergy assistance to Solomon Islands.\r\nI am pleased to announce that Solomon Islands has \r\njust deployed five police officers for United Nations \r\npeacekeeping duties. We intend to step up our efforts to \r\nmeet our global responsibility and send more officers \r\nto other missions abroad in the near future. On the \r\nregional front, Solomon Islands would like to express \r\nits gratitude to all 15 members of the Pacific Islands \r\nForum, including Australia and New Zealand, for their \r\nsteadfast partnership and commitment to Solomon \r\nIslands over the past 13 years. The Regional Assistance \r\nMission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) is winding down \r\nand will withdraw in June 2017. Solomon Islands is \r\nengaging with various partners, including Australia \r\nand New Zealand, on post-RAMSI arrangements.\r\nSolomon Islands remains committed to Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 16. We have conducted national \r\nreconciliation outreach and would like to thank the \r\nUnited Nations for making peacebuilding funds \r\navailable for use in Solomon Islands. We are currently \r\nundertaking legislative and land reforms, including \r\nnation-building economic investments. We are \r\ncommitted to unifying our culturally richly diverse \r\npopulation.\r\nOn the issue of the oceans, I am pleased to inform the \r\nAssembly that Solomon Islands is developing a national \r\nocean governance framework that will rationalize and \r\nenhance coordination and the implementation of all \r\nocean-related legislation. Solomon Islands has some of \r\nthe world’s most diverse marine species and is a member \r\nof the Coral Triangle Initiative (CTI). The Initiative \r\naffords us a coordinated approach to marine and \r\ncoastal management with Government leadership and a \r\nfocus on people-centred natural-resource management \r\nWe are mindful of the growing global attention to the \r\noceans and welcome the Assembly’s decision to convene \r\na United Nations conference on oceans and seas next \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 21/25\r\nyear. Solomon Islands also supports the establishment \r\nof a new agreement to deal with biodiversity in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction.\r\nThere is no single ocean entry point in the \r\nmultilateral system, and I call for the establishment \r\nof a world ocean authority. Such an authority would \r\ncoordinate all ocean-related treaties, entities and \r\nprogrammes, and move beyond the current sectoral \r\napproach to a single holistic and comprehensive \r\nframework.\r\nFisheries contribute significantly to the economies \r\nof the Pacific. Tuna has served to integrate the economies \r\nof the Pacific into global markets. This year the Pacific \r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS) celebrated Tuna \r\nDay here at the United Nations. I hope that it becomes \r\nan annual event, and we will explore the possibility of \r\nbringing a draft resolution to the General Assembly to \r\ndeclare 2 May as World Tuna Day.\r\nSolomon Islands is a party to the Nauru Agreement \r\non Cooperation in the Management of Fisheries of \r\nCommon Interest. We believe in a rights-based approach \r\nto fisheries management that guarantees resource \r\nowners their fair share of the benefits. The Vessel Day \r\nScheme is one such rights-based mechanism. It has \r\nsignificantly increased the economic returns from our \r\ntuna.\r\nI am pleased to note that one of Solomon Islands’ \r\nfour continental-shelf claims submitted to the United \r\nNations Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf is now awaiting decision by the Commission. The \r\njoint claim of the Federated States of Micronesia, Papua \r\nNew Guinea and Solomon Islands to the Ontong Java \r\nPlateau was considered by a subcommission in August. \r\nSolomon Islands would like to acknowledge the efforts \r\nof the joint delegation and thank the Division for Ocean \r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea for its assistance from \r\nits trust fund. We encourage all who are blessed with \r\nresources to contribute to the fund. I also thank the \r\nCommonwealth Secretariat for the technical support \r\nrendered to the joint delegation, and hope that similar \r\nsupport can be extended to the remaining claims.\r\nSolomon Islands recognizes the fundamental \r\nrights of the Republic of China on Taiwan and its \r\n23 million people to participate meaningfully in the \r\nUnited Nations specialized agencies. Solomon Islands \r\nfinds Taiwan’s limited and restricted participation with \r\nthe World Health Organization system regrettable, \r\nespecially at a time when the spread of infectious \r\ndiseases is impacting our children, and we need \r\neveryone to assist. We call for Taiwan’s open and free \r\naccess to all World Health Organization meetings. \r\nSimilarly, Taiwan remains unjustly on the fringes of \r\nthe International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) \r\ndecision-making processes, Taiwan manages more \r\nthan 1 million f lights, equalling 58 million passengers, \r\nthrough the Taipei Flight Information Region. We also \r\ncall for Taiwan’s predictable and certain participation \r\nin ICAO meetings. There have always been two \r\npolitical systems along the Taiwan Strait. The reality is \r\nthat the world works with one and turns a blind eye to \r\nthe other. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development calls for all hands on deck. \r\nLet us put the interests of humankind first and work \r\nwith all, including Taiwan.\r\nThe year 2016 is Solomon Islands’ second year as \r\nChair of the five-member Melanesian Spearhead Group \r\n(MSG). The Group has established the subregional \r\nHumanitarian and Emergency Response Coordination \r\nCentre so as to be able to respond to disasters in our \r\nsubregion. The increasing occurrence of severe tropical \r\ncyclones requires timely international and regional \r\nresponses in order to complement nationally led disaster-\r\nmanagement responses. The Group recently concluded \r\nnegotiations on a new MSG trade agreement. The new \r\nagreement, once signed by the five States, will deepen \r\nand tighten economic integration among the member \r\nStates. The Group continues to follow the question of \r\nNew Caledonia, which is on the United Nations agenda. \r\nWe wish the people of New Caledonia all the best as \r\nthey prepare to decide on their political future in 2018.\r\nSolomon Islands reaffirms its support for the \r\ninalienable right of the people of the territory of French \r\nPolynesia to self-determination, pursuant to the annual \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly, beginning in \r\n2013 (resolution 67/265). Solomon Islands continues \r\nto request the Administrative Power to work and \r\ncooperate with the United Nations Special Committee \r\non Decolonization on the question of French Polynesia, \r\nand we hope that the Special Committee will visit the \r\nterritory soon.\r\nSolomon Islands is gravely concerned about the \r\nhuman rights violations against Melanesians in West \r\nPapua. Human rights violations in West Papua and \r\nWest Papua’s pursuit of self-determination are two \r\nsides of the same coin. The many reports of human \r\nrights violations in West Papua corroborate the practice \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n22/25 16-29673\r\nof direct violations of human rights by Indonesia in its \r\nattempts to smother any form of opposition.\r\nThe principle of sovereignty is paramount in any \r\ninstitution whose core rationale is the respect for \r\nsovereignty. If, however, the justification of sovereignty \r\nrests on a series of decisions that are questionable, then \r\nthere is a case to challenge the legality of the argument \r\nfor sovereignty, as outlined in the Agreement signed \r\nin New York on 15 August 1962 and the Act of Free \r\nChoice. Solomon Islands adds its voice to those of other \r\nMember States and civil-society organizations that are \r\nconcerned about human rights violations in the Papua \r\nand West Papua regions of Indonesia. As the Chair of \r\nthe MSG, which includes Indonesia as an associate \r\nmember and the United Liberation Movement of West \r\nPapua as an observer, Solomon Islands affirms the need \r\nfor constructive engagement with Indonesia and looks \r\nforward to cooperating with Indonesia to address the \r\nviolations of human rights in West Papua.\r\nSolomon Islands welcomes the restoration of \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica. Solomon Islands continues to call on its \r\nfriend and partner the United States of America to work \r\ntowards completely lifting the embargo. On South-South \r\ncooperation, I would like to register my appreciation \r\nto Cuba for the medical scholarships offered to our \r\nstudents, and I am pleased to see the growing number \r\nof graduates returning to serve our people.\r\nThe Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action \r\nremains a source of guidance and inspiration on gender \r\nequality and gender empowerment. Solomon Islands \r\nremains committed to the full, effective and accelerated \r\nimplementation of the Platform for Action, which \r\nshould enable the realization of gender goals and targets \r\nunder the Sustainable Development Goals. In April of \r\nthis year, my Government welcomed the entry into \r\nforce of the Family Protection Act. My Government’s \r\ncontinued legal-reform programme will result in laws \r\nthat complement the functions of the Family Protection \r\nAct.\r\nA reform of the Security Council remains elusive. \r\nWe urge the Assembly to build on the work carried \r\nout at the previous session to make the Council more \r\naccountable, representative and transparent. Solomon \r\nIslands and fellow SIDS continue to seek a dedicated \r\nseat for SIDS in the non-permanent-seat category in the \r\nCouncil.\r\nIn conclusion, the journey to implement the SDGs \r\nhas begun. The Assembly will be measured by our \r\nsuccess in unlocking the means, tools and resources \r\nto transform our peoples’ lives and ensure them a \r\nsustainable future. Let us not fail our people.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of Solomon Islands for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Lesotho. \r\nMr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Lesotho, and inviting him to address the \r\nAssembly. \r\nMr. Mosisili (Lesotho): May I take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate the President on his well-deserved \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session. His distinguished career, \r\nexperience and impeccable credentials assure us \r\nof a successful session. Let me hasten to pledge \r\nmy delegation’s full support and cooperation to the \r\nPresident during his term of office. I also wish to \r\ncommend his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for \r\nhis outstanding leadership during the previous session.\r\nSimilar accolades go to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, under whose leadership the \r\nOrganization continues to discharge its mandate with \r\nhonour and commendable zeal. We may recall that, \r\nunder his stewardship, the United Nations dealt with \r\nseveral challenges, most of which were handled with \r\ngreat success. As we prepare to bid him farewell, \r\nwe do so with pride, as he has indeed discharged his \r\nresponsibilities with honour and dignity. He will leave \r\nan indelible footprint, and his successor will follow in \r\nhis footsteps, continuing the good work done.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 23/25\r\nThe seventy-first session of the General Assembly \r\ncomes at a time when the United Nations as an \r\nOrganization has made significant strides in addressing \r\nmany of the serious challenges facing the international \r\ncommunity. It is to the credit of the United Nations \r\nthat, since the end of the Second World War, no world-\r\nwide conflict has occurred, with the exception of \r\nlocalized skirmishes in various parts of the globe. The \r\ninternational community has enjoyed the longest period \r\nof sustained peace and development in modern history.\r\nThe intractable conflicts in the Middle East and \r\nAfrica and the tension on the Korean peninsula and in \r\nother parts of Asia, as well as the biggest global refugee \r\nproblem since the Second World War, are some of the \r\nchallenges facing the United Nations and the world \r\ntoday. Terrorism continues to rear its ugly head — in \r\nEurope, the Middle East, Africa and Asia — with the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham and other terrorist \r\nentities indiscriminately causing great damage to \r\nproperty and the needless loss of lives. World security \r\nis indivisible. Threats of conflict, terrorism and famine \r\nin one part of the world will always have debilitating \r\nrepercussions everywhere — the case in point being the \r\ninflux of refugees from Africa, the Middle East and \r\nAsia into Western Europe.\r\nThe adoption of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) last year and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change adopted at the recent Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change are notable landmarks that have \r\ncemented the role of the United Nations as the only \r\nforum at which collective diplomacy can bear fruit.\r\nThe theme chosen for the current session, namely, \r\n“The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal \r\npush to transform our world”, is most relevant and \r\nappropriate at this time when humankind is tottering on \r\na precipice resulting from hunger, poverty, disease and \r\nthe adverse consequences of climate change. The theme \r\nhighlights the collective desire of the United Nations \r\nto eradicate poverty in all its forms and dimensions. \r\nAs we may recall, the overriding message of the 2030 \r\nAgenda is to leave no one behind.\r\nThe unique and special challenges faced by the \r\nleast-developed countries, the landlocked developing \r\ncountries and the small island developing States, as \r\nwell as those emerging from conflicts, should be \r\nparamount in our minds as we consider strategies and \r\nsteps to be taken to bring the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals to fruition. We believe that the inclusion of \r\nall stakeholders, especially women and youth, in \r\nprogrammatic and results-oriented action will bring \r\nabout fundamental changes in the livelihoods and well-\r\nbeing of our societies. In Lesotho women constitute \r\na significant majority of the population and are the \r\nbackbone of our rural communities. Their human-\r\nresource potential must not be underestimated. It is for \r\nthat reason that we have promulgated laws that allow \r\nthem access to land, credit and the resources necessary \r\nfor their unfettered engagement in community activity.\r\nYoung people are always at the receiving end of an \r\neconomic downturn, anytime one occurs. Yet they are \r\nendowed with intellect, energy and the exuberance of \r\nyouth, which can be harnessed for development in the \r\nlong term. In line with the SDGs, we have undertaken \r\nto capacitate youth-owned micro, small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises so that they can acquire appropriate \r\nskills that will help them create jobs and take advantage \r\nof international markets already at their disposal. \r\nSpecial attention is being given to small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises, as they form an integral part of \r\nindustry and are potential employers for unskilled and \r\nsemi-skilled labour. It is also a point of entry for young \r\nentrepreneurs into the manufacturing and services \r\nsectors. In Lesotho’s coalition agreement, we have \r\ncommitted to supporting micro, small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises through appropriate regulatory \r\npolicies and access to finance.\r\nThe transition from the Millennium Development \r\nGoals to the SDGs has not been difficult, as there are \r\nmany synergies and complementarities between the \r\ntwo programmes. We are also aware of the synergies \r\nthat exist between the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the African Union (AU) Agenda 2063 \r\nand the Regional Indicative Strategic Development Plan \r\nof the Southern African Development Community. For \r\nour part in Lesotho, we have already begun a process \r\nto ensure that the three Agendas are mainstreamed \r\ninto our national policies and plans. With our limited \r\ndomestic resources, we are looking for innovative ways \r\nof pursuing our development priorities and aligning \r\nthem to the global, continental and regional agendas. \r\nTo that end, Lesotho has been working with the \r\nUnited Nations country office to conduct sensitization \r\nworkshops on the SDGs. So far, we have conducted \r\nsuch workshops for the private sector, civil society \r\nand members of Parliament. We are in the process of \r\nreviewing our national strategic development plan so as \r\nA/71/PV.18 23/09/2016\r\n24/25 16-29673\r\nto align it fully with the 2030 Agenda and regional and \r\ncontinental development plans.\r\nWe are convinced that a private-sector-led growth \r\nstrategy that ensures that that sector contributes to \r\neconomic growth, job creation, poverty alleviation \r\nand sustainable development is vital for competition, \r\nthe expansion of trade and investment opportunities. \r\nSustainable Development Goal 9, which enjoins us to \r\n“build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and \r\nsustainable industrialization and foster innovation”, \r\nrecognizes the importance of infrastructure, \r\nindustrialization and technology for the progress and \r\ndevelopment of countries like Lesotho.\r\nEconomic development cannot be sustainable \r\nwithout a conscious effort to protect the environment. \r\nThe adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange in 2015 is another milestone in the global effort \r\nto safeguard and promote humankind’s continuing \r\nprogress and survival. We welcome the pledges by \r\ndeveloped countries to make resources available for the \r\nGreen Climate Fund.\r\nThe threats posed by underdevelopment, climate \r\nchange and HIV/AIDS have pricked the conscience \r\nof humankind for many years. Lesotho has adopted \r\nan innovative, indigenous leadership programme that \r\nseeks to galvanize the collective wisdom of all levels \r\nof leadership to join in the fight against HIV/AIDS \r\nin particular, and to ensure that the health delivery \r\nsystem is affordable, accessible and effective. The \r\nprogramme was launched by His Majesty King Letsie \r\nIII on 25 August. We also launched a test-and-treat \r\nprogramme in April and revived the National AIDS \r\nCommission. Those are just a few of the initiatives \r\nthat the Government of Lesotho has taken to curb \r\nnew infections, maternal deaths and new incidences \r\nof tuberculosis.\r\nWe recognize the role of disarmament in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, and \r\nLesotho remains fully committed to the implementation \r\nof the provisions of Security Council resolution 1540 \r\n(2004), aimed at preventing the proliferation of nuclear, \r\nchemical and biological weapons. We therefore call \r\nupon all the nuclear-weapon States to start making \r\ndeep cuts in their current nuclear-weapon stockpiles, \r\nwith the ultimate aim of finally eliminating them \r\naltogether. The African Nuclear-Weapon-Free-Zone \r\nTreaty, which entered into force in July 2009, is a clear \r\ndemonstration of the continent’s desire for peace and \r\ngenuine nuclear disarmament.\r\nWe should all remain true to the principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect, which the General Assembly \r\nunanimously adopted less than a decade ago. That \r\nprinciple imposes upon us the responsibility to create \r\nconditions of peace, security and harmony, while \r\nleaving no room for hostility, violence or aggression. \r\nWe therefore remain committed to supporting actions \r\nby the Security Council that include authorization \r\nfor military intervention where necessary. Our \r\nunderstanding is that the principles in international \r\nlaw on the non-use of force in international relations, \r\nrespect for the sovereignty and the territorial integrity \r\nof States, as well as non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of other States, remain paramount and sacrosanct \r\nin all instances. We commend the Security Council for \r\nits work undertaken in keeping with those principles \r\nthroughout the years.\r\nFor that reason, I wish to reiterate Lesotho’s well-\r\nknown position on the reform of the Security Council, \r\nin line with the established position of the African \r\nUnion, as articulated in the Ezulwini Consensus. We \r\nstrongly urge that the very important issue of Security \r\nCouncil reform should not be turned into a joke. The \r\nsooner it is concluded, the better for humankind and for \r\npeace in the world.\r\nWe furthermore reiterate our position on the \r\none-China policy, a position that will ensure that the \r\npeople of China are not dismembered and huddled into \r\nimaginary geographic segments.\r\nThe right to self-determination and independence is \r\na God-given right that cannot be taken away arbitrarily. \r\nIt is for that reason that we have never wavered in our \r\nsupport for the independence of the people of Western \r\nSahara. We call upon the United Nations to assist the \r\nSecretary-General in resuscitating the negotiations on \r\nthe holding of a referendum in Western Sahara, so as to \r\ndetermine the will of the Saharawi people. We also urge \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco to support the process, so as \r\nto bring a lasting solution to the matter and facilitate the \r\nreturn of Morocco to its rightful place in the African \r\nUnion family.\r\nBy the same token, the plight of the Palestinian \r\npeople has been on the international community’s \r\nagenda for far too long. We call for a new initiative that \r\nwill buttress all efforts aimed at a two-State solution, \r\nwith the State of Israel and that of Palestine existing \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.18\r\n16-29673 25/25\r\nside by side in peace. A fresh initiative is required to \r\nrestart the process that produced the Oslo Accords \r\nand bring an end to the suffering of the communities \r\nconcerned, which have endured aggression for more \r\nthan 60 years. Surely, a permanent resolution of that \r\nseeming impasse is now overdue and urgent for the \r\nbenefit of the neighbouring countries as well and the \r\nworld at large.\r\nAs I conclude, let me express our hope and \r\nexpectation that in the next decade, the efforts of \r\nthe United Nations aimed at accelerating the pace of \r\neconomic development on a global scale will begin to \r\nshow tangible results. Let us work together to create \r\na world where the foundations of world peace and \r\nsecurity will continue to rest, not on the absence of war \r\nbut on the international principles of non-aggression, \r\nthe non-use of force in inter-State relations and the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes, in accordance with \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We will, hopefully, \r\ncontinue to consolidate the foundations of a world \r\nwhere the true definition of peace will manifest itself \r\nin harmonious relations among peoples and in mutual \r\nrespect and understanding between nations. We will \r\ncontinue to build prosperity for our peoples on the basis \r\nof the agreed principles embodied in the SDGs, which \r\nrepresent a pragmatic and visionary programme that \r\nseeks to free humankind from the bondage of hunger \r\nand poverty. We will ultimately embrace the need to \r\nallow reason to prevail over might. That is the future of \r\nour dreams — the future that we owe to posterity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Lesotho for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Pakalitha Bethuel Mosisili, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
