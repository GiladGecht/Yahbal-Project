"United Nations A/71/PV.19\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n19th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 23 September 2016, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Bouah-Kamon \r\n(Côte d’Ivoire), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government \r\nof the Principality of Andorra, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra, and inviting him to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMr. Martí Petit (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): This year, once \r\nagain, the United Nations calls upon all the countries \r\non planet Earth to participate in the General Assembly, \r\nwhich is — one could say — a kind of global Parliament. \r\nOnce again this year, we have the chance to take stock \r\nof the advances and setbacks that we have experienced \r\nin this large joint enterprise aimed at promoting peace, \r\nsecurity and the respect of human rights. Once again \r\nthis year, we are here to be critical, demanding and \r\nself-demanding, and to reflect on the need to renew and \r\nimprove the system of the United Nations.\r\nHowever, the fact that I can say “once again this \r\nyear” represents, in itself, a success. Beyond the good \r\ndecisions and the not-so-good ones made over the \r\nyears, the mere fact that almost 200 sovereign States \r\nsymbolically renew their commitment to the United \r\nNations each year is a reason for hope for those of \r\nus who, like the people of Andorra, firmly believe in \r\nmultilateralism and the need to promote peace, security \r\nand justice.\r\nThroughout its more than seven decades of \r\nexistence, the United Nations has not been a passive \r\nstakeholder or a static feature. Quite the contrary, it \r\nhas managed to extend its mission, make its objectives \r\nmore ambitious and give them content with tangible \r\nresults. The United Nations was created to promote \r\npeace, security and human rights. However, year after \r\nyear, it has spread its area of action to become what we \r\nsee today, that is, a large Assembly of all the countries \r\non planet Earth, which seek to resolve what affects all \r\nof us domestically and among all of us.\r\nThe past 12 months have been highly constructive \r\nwith regard to advances in the multilateral area. Just \r\none year ago, in September 2015, we unanimously \r\nadopted the Sustainable Development Goals listed \r\nin what is known as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. A few months later, the international \r\ncommunity — thanks to the driving force and leadership \r\nof the French Republic and our colleague François \r\nHollande — demonstrated its ability to give shape and \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

For one week, Andorra \r\nla Vella, our capital, was home to the reflections \r\nand debates of experts, as well as institutional \r\nrepresentatives, such as the Secretary-General of the \r\nCouncil of Europe and two Under-Secretaries-General \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe Andorra Summer University marks the \r\nbeginning of the academic year in our country, \r\nfollowing the summer break. This year, the people \r\nof Andorra started the academic year by confirming \r\nand demonstrating our commitment to the values of \r\nmultilateralism and international cooperation. We \r\nhave done so by adding our own particular accent, \r\nplacing emphasis on education. We therefore chose the \r\nSummer University as the setting for Andorra to show \r\nits commitment to the 2030 Agenda.\r\nAll the Sustainable Development Goals share the \r\nsame priority. However, Goal 4, on quality education \r\nis doubly important. On the one hand, it is an objective \r\nin and of itself that has a direct link to the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and to the Convention on \r\nthe Rights of the Child. But it is also a means to achieve \r\nthe rest of the Goals. At the time of the adoption of the \r\n2030 Agenda, the General Assembly warned about the \r\nneed to detail the Goals in their specific implementation \r\nand seek the involvement of all stakeholders — not \r\njust public institutions — in that ambitious enterprise. \r\nTherefore, global involvement, including on the part of \r\nindividuals, local institutions and large supranational \r\norganizations, requires a key tool, namely, education.\r\nThe great edifice of the United Nations principles \r\nand values is built upon the idea that what affects all \r\nof us needs to be solved by all of us and that global \r\nmatters require coordinated global actions. It is true \r\nthat a global world needs global institutions, as well as \r\nglobal regulations and global solutions. But the entire \r\narchitecture will be as fragile as a house of cards if we \r\ndo not educate new generations to be global citizens. A \r\nglobal world needs global citizens.\r\nIn striving to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, Andorra is placing its emphasis on education \r\nand extending quality education to everyone, not only \r\nas a goal in and of itself but also to promote education \r\ntowards global citizenship. Such citizenship is aware \r\nof the challenges and the opportunities in our world, \r\nsensitive to the protection of human rights, and open \r\nand prepared for the dynamics of our times.\r\nDuring the past several years, the Government \r\nthat I head has made education the centre of Andorra’s \r\nforeign policy in the multilateral arena. We did so during \r\nthe Andorran presidency of the Council of Europe for \r\n2012-2013. We did so by joining the Global Education \r\nFirst Initiative, promoted by Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon. We have done so in the contexts of the \r\nIbero-American Community and the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie. We will also do so by \r\nmaking education one of our priorities as members of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. We will continue to \r\ndo so in all multilateral forums dealing with education. \r\nHowever, in keeping with Goal 17 of the 2030 Agenda, \r\nwe are aware that we need to seek alliances with other \r\ncountries, joint actions and partnerships between the \r\npublic and the private sectors.\r\nAllow me to offer a recent example of Andorran \r\naction in the multilateral arena. Two weeks ago, the \r\ntwenty-fifth Conference of Ministers of Education \r\nof Ibero-American countries was held in Andorra. \r\nThe meeting gave rise to a commitment by the Ibero-\r\nAmerican Governments to promote the mobility of all \r\nour students. An agreement among the Governments, the \r\nIbero-American Secretary-General, the Organization \r\nof Ibero-American States for Education, Science and \r\nCulture and the Ibero-American University Board will \r\npromote the mobility of university students within \r\nthe Ibero-American area, which currently has 22 full \r\nmember States. The aim of the signatories is to offer \r\nmobility to 200,000 university students between now \r\nand 2020.\r\nAs always when talking about education, the goal \r\nis twofold. On the one hand, the goal is to promote \r\nan exchange of experiences, which contributes to \r\nimproving the quality of our education systems. On the \r\nother hand — and this is probably the most important \r\npart — the goal is to make our young people aware of \r\nthe fact that their reality and their future do not end at \r\nthe borders of the country in which they were born, but \r\nrather that they are citizens of a global society. To some \r\ndegree, we are following in the wake of the Erasmus \r\nprogramme for the mobility of university students in \r\nEurope. What has done more to promote European \r\nconstruction — all the regulations and directives that \r\nmake up the European Union acquis, or all the young \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 3/33\r\npeople who, for decades, have been completing part of \r\ntheir university courses in other European countries \r\nand who feel European?\r\nIt is not the young people who wish to isolate \r\nthemselves. And those of us who are here today — most \r\nof whom are from a generation that has left its youth \r\nbehind — must be increasingly more generous and \r\nmore open-minded, because the future of our young \r\npeople, the future of our countries and the future of our \r\nworld depends on it. If we educate our young people \r\nas citizens of a global world, we will be laying the \r\nfoundation for a much more open, cooperative and fair \r\nworld.\r\nIn line with the theme of this session, “The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push \r\nto transform our world”, Andorra’s commitment to \r\nquality education is not limited to diverse actions in \r\nmultilateral forums, but also has a local dimension. \r\nThe local dimension begins as a result of the good \r\nfortune — and it is necessary to say that because it is \r\ngood fortune — that we enjoy in having three public \r\nsystems that are free and available: the Spanish, the \r\nFrench and the Andorran systems. That in itself makes \r\nup a pluralist educational community with a marked \r\ninternational component.\r\nIn that sense, the people of Andorra have been \r\npioneers in our education system in introducing \r\n“education by skills”, which is a model that seeks to \r\novercome the old concept of education as a simple \r\naccumulation of knowledge to focus on education \r\nunderstood as a set of abilities and skills to apply that \r\nknowledge. The reason for that model is that what is \r\nimportant is not so much knowing, but thinking; we do \r\nnot wish to create encyclopaedias, but rather citizens. \r\nCitizens who can develop themselves and grow in a \r\nworld that is changing at great speed and who, when \r\nfaced with the expected and the unexpected, are able to \r\nreact appropriately and who are not afraid of changes, \r\ndynamism and opening up.\r\nWe in Andorra have been working on education \r\ncentred on transversal skills for some years now. And \r\nnow — precisely because of the need to educate global \r\ncitizens — we wish to go one step further. Andorra, \r\nin coordination with the Council of Europe, will \r\nintroduce training programmes on democratic values \r\nand systems, so as to measure the abilities and skills \r\nof our young people with regard to such democratic \r\nvalues. Why not think about a global commitment to \r\neducating our young children on the principles and \r\nvalues of the United Nations, and more specifically, on \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals embodied in the \r\n2030 Agenda? Because in 2030, it will be them, and not \r\nus, who will be sitting here in the General Assembly.\r\nThe great dialectic of our times is not — as it used \r\nto be in the past — between the right and the left, or the \r\npolicy of blocs, typical of the Cold War, which we have \r\nthankfully left behind. The great dialectic of our time \r\nis between being open and being closed, between those \r\nwho wish for an open, transparent, cooperative and \r\ndynamic world with strong multilateral institutions and \r\nthose who wish for a closed, opaque and static world in \r\nwhich each country looks, only and exclusively, after \r\nits own interests.\r\nThe road to opening up to commitment, negotiation \r\nand multilateralism is the path that we have been \r\ntracing for decades under the auspices of the United \r\nNations. The path to closing down is a reflection of \r\nfear and a recipe for populists and opportunists, who, \r\nwhen faced with an economic crisis of global scope, \r\nwithdraw into protectionism; when faced with a threat \r\nto security of global scope, close their borders; when \r\nfaced with a challenge such as climate change, adopt \r\nthe selfish attitude of free riding, or expecting others to \r\nmake the efforts. The answers of populism are that it is \r\nother people’s fault and that we should isolate ourselves \r\nfrom the others. However, in a global society, we are \r\nthe others.\r\nI believe that we are all here at the Assembly to \r\nrenew our confidence in a multilateral way and to \r\ncontinue practicing the maxim that says that global \r\nmatters require global answers. The Principality of \r\nAndorra today reiterates its belief in the multilateral \r\npath. Because it is in forums such as the General \r\nAssembly that a country like ours, with a surface \r\narea of 468 square kilometres and just over 70,000 \r\ninhabitants, can be on an equal footing with the rest \r\nof the nations on the planet. And I do not mean just \r\nrhetorical equality — we have been participating and \r\ngetting involved in coordinated, balanced actions that \r\ninvolve the entire international community, and we \r\nhave been doing so for years.\r\nWe have demonstrated that, quite adequately in \r\nmy opinion, by participating with all our efforts to \r\nbuild a more cooperative, transparent and fair global \r\neconomy. Over the past five years, Andorra has opened \r\nits economy to foreign investment, given economic \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n4/33 16-29679\r\nrights to all international residents, set up a comparable \r\ntax system following international standards, made \r\nprogressive advances in matters of exchanging fiscal \r\ninformation, which will culminate next year with the \r\nautomatic exchange of information within the area \r\nof the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment and the European Union, and we have \r\nalso set up a network of double taxation treaties to \r\ninternationalize the economic model.\r\nIn parallel, along with Monaco and San Marino, \r\nwe are negotiating an association agreement with the \r\nEuropean Union that will enable the full participation \r\nof Andorra in the European internal market. We have \r\ndone so not only because we need to modernize and \r\ndiversify our economy, but also because we are of \r\nthe firm conviction that a world with more intense \r\neconomic and commercial relations is by nature a \r\nworld that cooperates more and is less selfish. It is also \r\na world that is more inclined towards peace, harmony, \r\nnegotiated solutions to conflicts and respect for human \r\nrights and liberties.\r\nIt was in that same spirit of firm confidence in \r\nglobal action that we participated last year in the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, which led to the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. In the coming weeks, our Parliament \r\nwill be asked to ratify the Paris Agreement. It is with \r\nthat same mindset, in our view, that we need to deal \r\nwith the matter of the huge displacements of refugees \r\nand migrants, which have become one of the great \r\nchallenges of our times. It is a challenge that needs to be \r\ndealt with through the regulation, both internationally \r\nas well as locally, of migratory f lows and the right to \r\nasylum, through the fair distribution of the impact that \r\ntaking in a huge contingent of displaced people may \r\nrepresent, and through care and vigilance to ensure the \r\nrespect of rights and the dignity of displaced people.\r\nIn that connection, I am delighted, taking up \r\nwhat I said before regarding the fundamental role of \r\neducation, that the high-level meeting on addressing \r\nlarge movements of refugees and migrants, which took \r\nplace here on 19 September, also emphasized the need to \r\nconstruct a positive narrative on immigration. Andorra, \r\nwhich has for decades been a land that has welcomed \r\nmany families from all over, is a good example of that \r\npositive narrative, as is the case, I am sure, for many of \r\nthe countries represented here. However, in order for \r\nthat narrative to continue to be valid, we also need to \r\nteach the value of respect for diversity. We must raise \r\nworld citizens who do not fear difference or change.\r\nWhile populism would prefer protectionism and \r\neconomic isolation, we opt for liberalization and \r\ngreater integration of our national economies. While \r\npopulism would prefer to deny the scientific evidence \r\nof climate change and turn its back on the problem, we \r\nopt instead for commitments and specific measurable \r\nactions. While populism would prefer to close borders, \r\nbuild walls and stoke the fear of difference, we opt \r\ninstead for the dignity of persons, for regulation and for \r\neducation about diversity.\r\nThis is the last session of the General Assembly \r\nwith Mr. Ban Ki-moon as Secretary-General. Many \r\nspeakers have highlighted his career and his wise \r\ndecisions over the last decade. Mr. Ban Ki-moon is \r\nthe Secretary-General who brought about the effective \r\nimplementation of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals and was the driving force behind the post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. He has been a key player in the \r\nrelaunching of the multilateral strategy in the fight \r\nagainst climate change, which culminated in the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. As a legacy of his 10-\r\nyear mandate, he leaves us with a clearly marked path \r\nin the form of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) contained in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Mr. Ban Ki-moon is therefore a \r\nfundamental player in any understanding or explanation \r\nof the United Nations, and by extension, of the entire \r\ninternational community during the first third of the \r\ntwenty-first century.\r\nFor the people of Andorra, Mr. Ban Ki-moon is also \r\nthe first Secretary-General to make an official visit to \r\nour country, as he did in April 2013. The Andorran \r\npeople have heeded his teachings well. If education \r\nis the guiding thread to a good part of Andorra’s \r\nmultilateral action, that is also thanks to the insistence \r\nof the Secretary-General on making quality universal \r\neducation one of the main pillars of his action during \r\nhis 10 years at the helm of the United Nations. As \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon said during his visit to Andorra three \r\nand a half years ago, the United Nations will always be \r\nable to count on our country in the collective endeavour \r\nto build a more peaceful, secure and, above all, more \r\nequitable world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Head of \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 5/33\r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas, \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Vanuatu\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu.\r\nMr. Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Charlot \r\nSalwai Tabimasmas, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nVanuatu, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Salwai (Vanuatu) (spoke in French): Vanuatu \r\nwould like to join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session on his new role and function. We are proud \r\nthat, for the first time in the history of the United \r\nNations, one of our colleagues from the Pacific region \r\nhas taken up that post. The President can be assured \r\nof my delegation’s full support during his mandate and \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession. I also wish to express our sincere gratitude \r\nto the outgoing President of the General Assembly, \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, for guiding the work of the \r\nseventieth session.\r\nI would also convey my heartfelt gratitude to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his exceptional \r\nsteering of the United Nations for the last decade. \r\nThroughout those years he has shown the leadership \r\nof a true world citizen. His accomplishments are \r\nmany and are reflected in the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, the Sendai \r\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. Those key successes \r\nwill undoubtedly chart the future of humankind in the \r\nyears to come. I wish Mr. Ban Ki-moon all the best in \r\nhis future endeavours.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\ncontinue to be one of our most essentials tools for \r\npreventive diplomacy, as they fulfil our promise to \r\nhumankind to respect the noble aspirations enshrined \r\nin the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.\r\nToday, the world continues to face complex \r\nchallenges. The role of the United Nations in that \r\ncontext, as expressed in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, is more essential than ever. The global \r\neconomy continually faces macroeconomic challenges \r\nplagued by uncertainty resulting from the ramifications \r\nof the global financial crisis and the weak prices for \r\nraw materials in recent years.\r\nThe precarious global economic outlook bodes \r\npoorly for future investments and global economic \r\ngrowth in the short and medium term. Global terrorism \r\nand instability in certain regions have given rise to \r\nsome of the worst humanitarian crises that the world has \r\never known. Never before in the history of the United \r\nNations have we seen such massive displacements of \r\npeople. Forced migration has become a global crisis \r\nand reminds us of our shared responsibility to promote \r\ntolerance, good governance, the rule of law, and respect \r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nClimate change is real. Its effects are being felt \r\nthroughout the world. I congratulate the United States, \r\nChina and the many other countries that have shown the \r\nworld the path to take in ratifying the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change. I have submitted our ratification \r\nof the Paris Agreement to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, and I am proud that small island developing \r\nStates like Vanuatu are in the vanguard of the efforts to \r\ncombat climate change. I would encourage the States \r\nthat have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement to do so \r\nas soon as possible.\r\nThe ratification of the Paris Agreement will come \r\nto naught unless we take bold action to limit the long-\r\nterm rise in average global temperature to 1.5°C. That \r\nis a crucial test for our leaders in the near future, and \r\nwe will fight for the true implementation of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. We urge all leaders of \r\nthe world to join the small island developing States in \r\nincreasing our mitigation efforts. We call for the early \r\nentry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. The destiny of the world and the fulfilment of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals depend upon our \r\ncollective efforts.\r\nMy delegation believes in the lofty mandate of \r\nthis international Organization, as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. However, just like any \r\norganization, it must be adapted in correspondence \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n6/33 16-29679\r\nwith its objectives through significant reforms. As a \r\nkey organ of the United Nations, the Security Council \r\nmust strengthen its coherence in relation to the other \r\nbodies of the Organization.\r\nRegarding the reform of the Security Council, \r\nVanuatu is in favour of improving transparency, \r\naccountability, relevance, inclusivity and effectiveness \r\nin order to manage the global contemporary threats and \r\nchallenges that jeopardize peace and security. Such \r\nreforms must allow the Security Council to adapt to \r\nchanges in the panorama of international security.\r\nVanuatu also continues to support the work of \r\nrevitalizing the General Assembly. Those reforms must \r\nbe systematic and respect the integrity of the United \r\nNations. Therefore, leadership on the part of the most \r\npowerful States becomes necessary in undertaking \r\nreform in the face of the global challenges, which \r\ndemand collective action. I would request that the \r\nSecurity Council and the General Assembly choose a \r\nperson of impeccable ethics and integrity to be the next \r\nSecretary-General, who will continue to be a beacon of \r\nhope for all those without a voice.\r\nIn order to attain the SDGs, the major mandates \r\nof the United Nations and the United Nations system \r\nmust be coordinated to work actively with regional \r\nbodies such as the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum Fisheries Agency, the \r\nPacific Community and the South Pacific Regional \r\nEnvironment Programme. At the recent meeting of \r\nthe leaders of the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat \r\nin the Federated States of Micronesia in September, \r\nit was agreed that the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nand efforts to make the Pacific more resilient to \r\nclimate change and natural disasters remain essential \r\ncomponents of our journey towards a sustainable future \r\nfor our region.\r\nOur oceans, our fisheries, gender equality, human \r\nrights, health care and education are all important \r\npriorities for our region. Given the coherence of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development with the \r\nglobal frameworks of the United Nations, an innovative \r\npartnership with regional organizations in the Pacific \r\nis important in order to transform the agreed intentions \r\ninto significant actions for our people.\r\nVanuatu condemns all forms of nuclear \r\nproliferation and remains committed to the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We reaffirm \r\nour position in favour of a nuclear-free Pacific.\r\nVanuatu confirms its commitment to fulfilling the \r\nSDGs. We have made significant progress in integrating \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development into \r\nour national plan for sustainable development. The \r\nprotection of oceans specifically remains one of our \r\nforemost priorities within the framework of the SDGs. \r\nIt is one of Vanuatu’s aspirations to see ocean protection \r\nimplemented immediately, and we welcome the fact that \r\nmany States, both small and large, have taken measures \r\nto revive our oceans.\r\nI am pleased to declare that Vanuatu adopted \r\nits very first national ocean policy, which will help \r\nus to implement the objectives laid out in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Our current \r\nefforts, demonstrated by the political priorities of my \r\nGovernment, are in line with the SDGs and include a \r\nlist of initiatives likely to accelerate the socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of Vanuatu.\r\nThe mobilization of national resources to finance \r\nsustainable development remains one of the key \r\npriorities of our Government. We have recently created \r\na committee to review our sources of revenue and \r\nexpand our fiscal base. That represents a major reform, \r\none of the most important since our independence in \r\n1980. Such resources must supplement the financial \r\nassistance provided by our development partners and \r\noffer us new sources of financing in order to strengthen \r\nour institutions while developing our own human \r\nresources and infrastructures. All of those initiatives \r\nshould improve our long-term economic productivity \r\nand help us to build a resilient economy. Such efforts \r\nshould also help remove Vanuatu from the list of \r\nleast developed countries in 2020, as well as from the \r\ngrey list.\r\nIn spite of the ambitions and noble vision of my \r\nGovernment, my country is still facing insurmountable \r\nchallenges that stretch beyond our means and that we \r\ncannot address on a national scale. That is also the \r\ncase for many other vulnerable and fragile States. It \r\nis therefore essential that the international community \r\nprovide assistance with reasonable criteria for extremely \r\nvulnerable countries facing external shocks. In the \r\nGlobal Climate Risk Index 2014, four of the Pacific \r\nisland States are among the top 10 countries exposed to \r\nnatural disasters in the world. Vanuatu remains at the \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 7/33\r\nhead of that list, despite our status as the most beautiful \r\nand happiest country in the world.\r\nThe magnitude of the devastating Category 5 \r\nsevere tropical cyclone Pam had a major impact on our \r\neconomy. Vanuatu faces one of the highest rates of sea-\r\nlevel rise that we have seen in the Pacific. Its impact has \r\nprovoked a number of problems from epidemics to the \r\nmultiplication of destructive insects, undermining food \r\nsecurity and affecting the variability of precipitation. \r\nThat situation has caused various problems for public \r\nhealth.\r\nThe presence of such extreme climate events has \r\ncaused major harm to our infrastructure and economy. \r\nClimate change in Vanuatu is responsible for the loss of \r\nland to the sea and has also had a devastating effect on \r\nthe food we eat, on our subsistence economy and, above \r\nall else, on the health of our people. Despite the fact that \r\nthe Pacific is known for f loods owing to the rise in sea \r\nlevels, the disappearance of entire islands means that \r\nthe people of Vanuatu will be forced to move inland. \r\nHowever, we will be transforming our ways of life to \r\nadapt to the climate change that is already affecting \r\nthe population.\r\nAlthough we profoundly appreciate the assistance \r\nprovided by the international community in coordinating \r\nfinancial aid to help rebuild in the aftermath of \r\nnatural disasters, the actions of non-governmental \r\norganizations, particularly international humanitarian \r\norganizations, have often proved ineffective. The \r\nnon-governmental organizations do not always respect \r\nthe priorities of the country with regard to rebuilding \r\nand recovery. That is a major challenge that all too \r\noften results in their attention being redirected to \r\nother needs that are not the immediate ones of the \r\naffected population. The Government could have more \r\nresponsibility if the assistance funds were processed \r\nthrough the governmental system.\r\nThe inclusion of vulnerable groups, such as people \r\nwith special needs and girls and women, is an important \r\npriority for my Government. Our policy is rooted in \r\ninclusive economic growth. The scourge of sexual and \r\ndomestic violence against women and girls is still a \r\nmajor challenge, and if no action is taken, the outlook \r\nfor global development is uncertain. My country will \r\ncertainly take the necessary steps to confront that \r\nchallenge.\r\nAlthough our historical past has seen little change, \r\nmy Government is in slow but steady consultations on \r\nconstitutional reform in order to ensure that, in future, \r\nwomen play a more active role in making decisions and \r\ninfluencing policies within our Parliament. That major \r\nreform will have its day.\r\nMy country will continue its cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations in the area of global peace and security. \r\nWe cannot guarantee development and the right to a life \r\nof dignity for our people in a world torn by wars and \r\nravaged by conflicts. We all must contribute to efforts \r\nto maintain peace and global security in the world we \r\nlive in. Vanuatu is proud of having members serve in \r\npeacekeeping forces under the United Nations banner \r\nin Haiti and in Côte d’Ivoire. We are ready to send more \r\ntroops in the future if we are called to do so.\r\nDecolonization remains a key issue that requires \r\nour collective efforts if we are to make the self-\r\ndetermination of peoples a reality, in accordance with \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We must express our \r\nsolidarity and our commitment to eradicate colonialism \r\nin all its forms. In that regard, I am pleased to note \r\nthat the United Nations is aiding New Caledonia with \r\nits electoral lists. I hope that the controversies related \r\nto the electoral lists will be resolved amicably among \r\nthe concerned parties and that the next referendum \r\nwill yield fair, transparent and pacifying results. Going \r\nforward, it is for the Caledonians to freely choose their \r\nfuture self-determination status.\r\nWe, the leaders of the Pacific islands, during the \r\nrecent meeting of the Forum in the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia, accepted New Caledonia and French \r\nPolynesia as full members of the Pacific Islands Forum, \r\nin spite of their status as non-independent territories. \r\nThis constitutes a major step on the path to regional \r\nintegration and the unification of the Pacific island \r\ncountries, leaving no one behind in the fight against \r\nthe impact of climate change and illegal fishing or in \r\nthe creation of economic opportunities through trade \r\nand more open economic relationships.\r\nThe issue of human rights must remain at the top \r\nof the United Nations agenda. The Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, reminded us in 2012 that human \r\nrights are inalienable and constitute a fundamental \r\nprinciple of the United Nations. As Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, it is our duty to demand that those \r\nwords be translated into concrete actions.\r\nThe issue of human rights for the peoples in West \r\nPapua remains unresolved. I stand on this rostrum, as \r\ndid my predecessors with the same moral conviction, to \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n8/33 16-29679\r\ncall on the United Nations to take concrete measures to \r\nresolve that question and fellow leaders have supported \r\nthe plea of the West Papuans. The United Nations \r\nshould not close its eyes to the abuses of human rights \r\nin the province of West Papua. The people of West \r\nPapua have turned to the United Nations for a glimmer \r\nof hope — a hope for freedom to exercise of their rights \r\nin their own territory and to freely assert their identity. \r\nI urge the United Nations to include this issue in its \r\nHuman Rights Up Front initiative.\r\nIn conclusion, as we begin an era of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, the importance of working together \r\nbecomes more evident and urgent. The implementation \r\nof international agreements will not be an easy matter, \r\ngiven the complex global challenges and the hostile \r\nenvironment in which we live. However, everything \r\nis possible and we must believe that. We must ensure \r\nthat the promise of the Charter of the United Nations is \r\nrespected for those who need it most. Our role is one of \r\nbridging the gap between the rhetoric and the action in \r\norder to ensure that no one is left behind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Vanuatu for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Charlot Salwai Tabimasmas, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Vanuatu, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, the Public \r\nService, National Security, Legal Affairs \r\nand Grenadines Affairs of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Finance, the Public Service, \r\nNational Security, Legal Affairs and Grenadines \r\nAffairs of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.\r\nMr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, the Public Service, National Security, \r\nLegal Affairs and Grenadines Affairs of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Ralph \r\nGonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for Finance, \r\nthe Public Service, National Security, Legal Affairs \r\nand Grenadines Affairs of Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Gonsalves (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is proud whenever a \r\nmember of our small island developing States assumes \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly. As we thank \r\nthe outgoing President for his noble efforts, we place \r\nspecial trust in the new President to lead our Assembly \r\nat this crucial juncture. From our Atlantic archipelago \r\nto his Pacific one, we pledge our cooperation and \r\nsolidarity as he discharges his important mission.\r\nWith each passing year, the Assembly has heard \r\nmore and more voices with greater and greater \r\nintensity chronicling the shortcomings, as well as \r\nthe possibilities, of our modern global order. As that \r\ncrescendo of collective wisdom has grown evermore \r\npowerful, it has become increasingly apparent that \r\nthe inbuilt inequalities of our global architecture are \r\nthreatening the very foundations of this 71-year-old \r\ninternational experiment — inequalities of access and \r\nopportunity, unequal distribution of global burdens \r\nand benefits, a system of double standards untethered \r\nfrom principle, a calcification of the very divisions that \r\nglobalization was meant to obliterate.\r\nHowever, even as the voices have grown more \r\npowerful, the inequalities they decry have remained \r\nstubbornly intractable. The voices from the periphery, \r\nno matter how loud or plentiful, appear unable to rouse \r\nthe core beneficiaries of a f lawed system from their \r\naff luent apathy. No matter how many global crises \r\nhave been and are plainly rooted in global inequalities, \r\npowerful short-term self-interest has prevailed in the \r\nface of collective common sense.\r\nThe year 2016 has seen the ripening of the fruit of \r\nthat short-sighted approach. The pressure for change \r\nnow comes not only from the marginalized outposts \r\nof globalization’s casualties, but internally, from \r\nwithin the rich and powerful nations themselves. The \r\nglobalization’s discontents and its discontented have \r\nreached critical mass within the citadels of casino \r\ncapitalism and consumption. That discontent has been \r\ntransmitted with crystal clarity by way of the ballot \r\nboxes from Montana to the British Midlands, where the \r\ncool logic of the status quo was trumped by emotional \r\nappeals for a return, however undesirable, to past \r\nglories imagined or real. The crescendo of voices is \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 9/33\r\nnow borderless and cross-cutting. It is impossible to \r\nignore any longer.\r\nThe threadbare clichés of globalization’s presumed \r\nbenefits are of cold comfort to marginalized nations \r\nand peoples. The latter have fasted too long at the \r\ndry spigot of promised trickle-down prosperity. The \r\nlonged-for rising tide that lifts all boats has come in \r\nthe form of rising seas that threaten to inundate small \r\nisland developing States and a tsunami of corporate \r\nconsolidations that has had a deleterious effect on small \r\nStates, small businesses, small farmers and the poor. \r\nThis year, we must address the chasm between our \r\nidealistic expectations and our deeply f lawed realities. \r\nModern globalization as a concept, as a rules-and-\r\nnorms-based system and as an international practice \r\nis unbalanced and unsustainable. It is a system that is \r\nbroken, one that is not beyond repair, but in urgent need \r\nof reform. Globalization benefits few and is an onerous \r\nburden on too many. To use a cricketing metaphor, we \r\nmust take a fresh guard.\r\nIt is that urgent need for a fresh and transformative \r\napproach that adds impetus and a sense of immediacy \r\nto the President’s theme for this year’s general debate, \r\nwhich calls for a universal push to transform our world. \r\nIn order to achieve that transformation, the President has \r\nrecognized the potential of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs), and in doing so has correctly identified \r\nour existing difficulties as being rooted in the inequities \r\nthat the SDGs seek to address. Our collective quest \r\nto achieve those Goals is indistinguishable from the \r\noverarching pursuit of a fairer, more just and more \r\nequal world. We must accept the President’s invitation \r\nto rethink and redesign our global compact, not in the \r\nnarrow interests of modern-day robber barons, but with \r\npeople-centred programmes and policies in mind.\r\nIn Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, my \r\nGovernment has comprehensively incorporated the \r\n2030 Agenda into its planning. It has focused on \r\neconomic development and job creation, quality \r\neducation, poverty eradication, the strengthening of \r\ninstitutions and infrastructure, renewable energy, \r\nclimate resilience and the health, well-being and \r\nsecurity of citizens. These are all central to our national \r\nmedium-term development plans.\r\nThis year, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nlaunched a zero-hunger trust fund, inspired by Goals 1 \r\nand 2 of the SDGs. The zero-hunger trust fund employs \r\na narrowly targeted and multifaceted set of tools that \r\nare designed to ensure that, by 2020, no citizen goes \r\nhungry. We hope that the fund will be generously \r\nsupported by our developmental partners and that it \r\nwill become a best practice that can be adopted and \r\nadapted in other small island contexts.\r\nGoal 7 of the SDGs calls for the development of \r\nrenewable energy with particular emphasis on small \r\nisland States. In our quest for affordable and clean \r\nenergy, our country has heavily invested in developing \r\nits geothermal resources. We anticipate that by 2019, \r\n50 per cent of our national energy will be geothermal \r\nand 80 per cent of our energy will come from a mixture \r\nof renewable resources, including hydroelectric and \r\nsolar energy. We are indebted to the Clinton Global \r\nInitiative, the Abu Dhabi Fund for Development, the \r\nInternational Fund for Agricultural Development, the \r\nCaribbean Development Bank, and the International \r\nRenewable Energy Agency, to name but a few, for their \r\ninvaluable support of the initiative.\r\nAs major greenhouse-gas emitters continue to \r\ndither, more frequent and more intense hurricanes \r\ncontinue to sweep our lands and to wash away large \r\nportions of our gross domestic product. We are already \r\nexperiencing the terrible effects of climate change. The \r\nspotlight on mitigation should now also be shone on \r\nadaptation, which is a more immediate concern. The \r\ntrajectory we face is one of rising temperatures and \r\nthe mitigation pledges made by countries ahead of the \r\nParis Agreement in December 2015 put us on track for \r\na 3-3.5°C increase in global temperatures by the end \r\nof the century. I applaud the international community \r\nfor reaching the much-anticipated Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change in December last year, as well as the \r\nSecretary-General for convening the high-level event \r\non entry into force of Paris Agreement during the \r\ncurrent seventy-first session.\r\nHowever, the promises made in the Paris \r\nAgreement to mitigate climate change and to provide \r\nclimate financial aid are inadequate and unenforceable. \r\nIndeed, as President Obama of the United States noted \r\nin his final address to this Organization, the Paris \r\nAgreement is just a framework; therefore, we need to \r\nbe more ambitious. The failure to mobilize sufficiently \r\nand facilitate access to promised climate financial \r\naid mirrors official development aid scenarios, where \r\nthe majority of developed countries have failed to \r\nmeet the 0.7 per cent target of gross national income \r\nthat was agreed to in the Monterrey Consensus in \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n10/33 16-29679\r\n2002. Accessing the promised financial aid has been \r\nextremely difficult.\r\nFor globalization to be legitimately transformed, it \r\nmust be fully inclusive. That inclusivity must be based \r\non the principles of sovereign equality, non-interference \r\nembodied in the letter and the spirit of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and on an end to the cynical enabling of \r\nmajor Powers’ interests at the expense of people’s lives \r\nand livelihoods. Nowhere is that cynicism and feigned \r\nimpotence more apparent than in the civil war that has \r\ndevastated the Syrian Arab Republic over the past five \r\nyears. The Assembly and the Security Council have too \r\nfrequently turned a blind eye and stayed silent when \r\nfaced with the actions of countries that have sought to \r\nfund and foment war and instability in Syria. Creative \r\ndiplomacy, not military victory, is clearly the answer \r\nfor putting an end to this conflict.\r\nThe impotence of learned helplessness and the \r\ntyranny of failure to intervene has meant that many \r\nnations have been repeatedly and unjustly excluded \r\nfrom the promise of an integrated world. The people \r\nof the State of Palestine are victims of that impotence, \r\ndespite the overwhelming recognition of Palestine and \r\nthe obvious need for an independent and internationally \r\nsupported contiguous State, where the population is \r\nable to live in peace alongside its Israeli neighbours.\r\nThe people-centred and progressive leaders of \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean, who dared to dream \r\nof alternatives to an iniquitous status quo, are once \r\nagain being punished for their impertinence — from \r\nthe continued embargo against the noble Cuban people \r\nand the externally stoked unrest in Venezuela, to the \r\nparliamentary coup d’état in Brazil. We are entering a \r\nnew but depressingly familiar chapter in a book that is \r\nalready soaked with the blood of progressive heroes. \r\nHowever, the schemes of yesteryear, with their dirty \r\ntricks and divisions, will fail when faced with the \r\nnew solidarity that has taken root across our region. \r\nOur States, as part of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM), the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States, the Bolivarian Alternative for the \r\nAmericas as well as the signatories to the Petrocaribe \r\nEnergy Cooperation Agreement, understand the \r\nunshakeable strength that comes from unity and the \r\ncourage of our collective convictions.\r\nThis year marks the inauguration of a new, \r\ndemocratically elected President of the Republic of \r\nChina on Taiwan. The Government of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines reaffirms our continued solidarity \r\nwith the aspirations of the Taiwanese Government and \r\npeople, just as they have stood with us throughout our \r\npost-independence development journey. We decry the \r\nmyopia of a body that pretends 24 million people do \r\nnot exist and that has forced people to choose between \r\ntwo magnificent exemplars of the noble Chinese \r\ncivilization. Such behaviour marginalizes a vibrant \r\npopulation and creates space for parasitic opportunists \r\nto prostitute principle for personal gain. We must \r\nrecognize Taiwan’s exemplary global leadership \r\nand citizenship and its commitment to development \r\nworldwide. It is high time that the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan be allowed to participate meaningfully in all of \r\nthe specialized bodies and programmes of the United \r\nNations system. There is absolutely no compelling \r\nargument to the contrary.\r\nI have spoken in the past of the shameful failure \r\non the part of the United Nations to acknowledge its \r\nindisputable role in the spread of cholera in Haiti. The \r\ncatastrophe has now killed over 10,000 Haitians and \r\ninfected almost 800,000 others. The outbreak shows \r\nno sign of abating. Last month, the United Nations \r\nbelatedly acknowledged its culpability while continuing \r\nto use claims of immunity to deny the victims of such a \r\ntragedy their fundamental right to be made whole. The \r\ncholera epidemic and the failure of the United Nations \r\nto address or arrest it has laid bare a shameful ethical \r\nbankruptcy and institutional cowardice through legal \r\nsubterfuge. The report of the Special Rapporteur on \r\nextreme poverty and human rights, Mr. Philip Alston, \r\nhas called the response of the United Nations to the \r\ncholera epidemic, “morally unconscionable, legally \r\nindefensible and politically self-defeating” (A/71/367, \r\np. 2). We agree.\r\nIn Haiti’s neighbour, the Dominican Republic, \r\nthe human rights crisis affecting tens of thousands of \r\nDominican-born citizens of Haitian descent remains \r\nunresolved. As the Caribbean community and other \r\nactors have sought to persuade the Dominican \r\nauthorities to respect the rights of its citizens against \r\nstatelessness and State-sponsored ethnic and racial \r\nvictimization, indifference on the part of the United \r\nNations is wholly unacceptable.\r\nMs. Young (Belize), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe Caribbean communities’ determined quest \r\nfor reparatory justice for victims of the transatlantic \r\nslave trade — a native genocide — continues to \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 11/33\r\ngather momentum. Historians, economists and other \r\nacademics, human rights lawyers and social activists \r\nacross the world have coalesced into a formidable \r\nadvocacy and educational force around our cause. \r\nOur citizens continue to be enthusiastically engaged \r\nin the process of discussion and awareness. We call \r\nupon the European nations that created and profited \r\nimmeasurably from the indefensible trade of human \r\nbeings to join us in the conversation about the \r\ncontours of a just and appropriate response to such \r\na monumental tragedy and its consequential legacy \r\nof underdevelopment.\r\nThe uneven prolonged aftermath of the 2008 \r\nglobal economic and financial crisis highlights the \r\nneed for reform in all the major global institutions. We \r\nare having difficulties across the world with heavy-\r\nhanded financial regulations that hamper legitimate \r\ntransactions and the corresponding banking relations.\r\nAs I conclude, I stress that the dream of equitable \r\ndevelopment cannot be deferred any longer. Let us \r\nimagine a better world, a fairer world, a peaceful world, \r\na world with a safe and sustainable future — and let \r\nus work towards that world, unburdened by the errors \r\nof the past or constrained by the shackles of a learned \r\nhelplessness, but confident, optimistic and clear-\r\nsighted about the boundless possibilities of genuine \r\ninternational cooperation. The universal push to \r\ntransform our world is urgent and necessary. We know \r\nand feel that fundamental truth. It is time for focused \r\nand meaningful action. Let us get on with it.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Finance, the Public Service, National Security, \r\nLegal Affairs and Grenadines Affairs of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Ralph Gonsalves, Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nFinance, the Public Service, National Security, \r\nLegal Affairs and Grenadines Affairs of Saint \r\nVincent and the Grenadines, was escorted from the \r\nrostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Public Utilities \r\nof Tuvalu\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister for \r\nPublic Utilities of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Public Utilities of Tuvalu, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Public Utilities of \r\nTuvalu, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sopoaga (Tuvalu): On behalf of the Government \r\nand people of Tuvalu, I bring greetings to the United \r\nNations. We offer our prayers for those affected by the \r\ntragic loss of lives resulting from acts of violence here \r\nin our host country, the United States of America, and \r\nworldwide.\r\nLet me now add Tuvalu’s commendations to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, Mr. Peter Thomson \r\nof Fiji, who takes the helm at this session. While we \r\nappreciate the enormous task placed upon Fiji, we also \r\nhave full confidence in the ability of Mr. Thomson \r\nand Fiji to steer us through the troubled waters of \r\nglobal oceans.\r\nAs the smallest Member of the United Nations \r\nfamily, Tuvalu continues to hold dear the noble \r\nvalues and principles of the United Nations. We very \r\nmuch hope that, as a result of the action of the United \r\nNations, peoples of all races and creeds, of all countries \r\nbig and small, particularly those whose very existence \r\nis threatened by human-induced strife, conflicts and \r\nespecially by the impacts of climate change, will \r\nbe saved.\r\nOver the past few days, the leadership of the \r\nOrganization has been put to the test. Will we as leaders \r\nbe able to provide a vessel, a canoe, buoyant enough to \r\nprotect and save even the smallest islands of the planet? \r\nWill the canoe of the United Nations enable us to rise \r\nwith the tide of progress and to sail through the surges \r\nof environmental insecurity and climate change, or will \r\nit sink us?\r\nTuvalu is immensely encouraged by the actions of \r\nworld leaders in the past week, by the strong leadership \r\nof our Secretary-General and by the goodwill of \r\nhumankind that continues to prevail. The adoption of \r\nthe New York Declaration on the Movement of Migrants \r\nand Refugees (71/1), the compounding commitment to \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nmany countries that have ratified the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change have given us hope and renewed \r\ntrust and confidence in the work of the United Nations \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n12/33 16-29679\r\nand its ability to fulfil our hopes for the security, \r\nprogress, and protection of our human rights.\r\nAnd now we must deliver on our words. Tuvalu \r\napplauds the strong leadership of the United States \r\nof America, other major greenhouse-gas emitters and \r\nthe small island developing States (SIDS) — all of \r\nthem, from the Pacific islands to other regions like the \r\nCaribbean and the Indian Ocean — to ratify the Paris \r\nAgreement on climate change. But that is not enough. \r\nWe must ensure that the Paris Agreement enters into \r\nforce. It must be fully elaborated and operationalized \r\nas early as possible in order to achieve real adaptation \r\nand mitigation.\r\nAtoll nations such as Tuvalu, Kiribati, the Marshall \r\nIslands, the Maldives, Tokelau and all other SIDS — Fiji, \r\nPapua New Guinea, Vanuatu and Samoa — are already \r\nsuffering the impacts of climate change and sea-level \r\nrise. Many predict their total extinction if nothing is \r\nurgently done. That cannot and must not be allowed to \r\nhappen. It would be shameful for humankind to allow \r\nsuch an eventuality. It would be shameful of us if we \r\nwho are sitting in this Hall were not to take action to \r\nstop that from happening.\r\nTuvalu therefore appeals to all States to ensure that \r\nour collective efforts under the Paris Agreement keep \r\nthe global temperature increase to below 1.5°C relative \r\nto pre-industrial levels, not only to fulfil the objectives \r\nof the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, but to save \r\nus all and ensure our future survival. We pray that, \r\nthrough the United Nations, our humble voice will \r\nprevail on the conscience and goodwill of humankind \r\nto take real and urgent action.\r\nWe must also ensure that we take account of \r\nthe protection of the human rights of those people \r\ndisplaced by the impacts of climate change. We need a \r\nlegal framework to that end, and Tuvalu has proposed a \r\nUnited Nations resolution facilitating the establishment \r\nof just such a framework.\r\nOn behalf of Tuvalu, I pay tribute to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his steadfast stewardship \r\nand his commitment to the noble principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and the peoples of the \r\nworld. We have made tremendous strides under his \r\nleadership. As he leaves the United Nations, I wish him \r\nand his family well in their future plans.\r\nThe work of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session is no different than at past sessions, \r\nexcept for its urgency. Tuvalu welcomes the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/71/1) and pledges its support to the \r\ntheme, entitled “The Sustainable Development Goals: \r\na universal push to transform our world”. However, \r\nas noted in the Secretary-General’s report, there is a \r\nreal need for urgent actions to address the growing \r\nmultiplicity and complexity of global challenges. It is \r\nvitally important that we address gender inequalities \r\nand ensure the rights of people with disabilities.\r\nAs regards peace and security, we applaud the work \r\nof the United Nations on many fronts and encourage \r\nfurther work to find long-lasting solutions to the long \r\ndrawn-out conflicts in Syria, Ukraine and other troubled \r\nspots of the world. The loss of precious lives and misery \r\nare totally unacceptable and must be stopped.\r\nWe also encourage and welcome the normalization \r\nof diplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates. However, we believe that it is important for \r\nthe sake of peace and security that those relations be \r\npragmatically translated into other areas of cooperation. \r\nWe should recognize, of course, Cuba’s humanitarian \r\nsupport and contribution — including its support to \r\nTuvaluans in the form of scholarships and training, \r\nfrom which we have tremendously benefited.\r\nThe provocative actions displayed by the People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic of Korea against the Republic of \r\nKorea and their potential implications for peace and \r\nsecurity in the world, including in our own Pacific \r\nOcean region, are totally unacceptable. We deplore \r\nthose actions and urge that urgent steps be taken to \r\ncompletely suspend them at the earliest opportunity.\r\nWe are also concerned about the continuing denial \r\nof the right of the 24 million people of the Republic of \r\nChina on Taiwan to be readmitted to United Nations \r\nmembership so that they can participate in the work \r\nof the United Nations and its specialized agencies. We \r\nneed to recognize that Taiwan is a vibrant democracy, \r\nwhich has recently elected and inaugurated a new \r\nPresident. Taiwan’s genuine efforts in supporting \r\nvarious developmental and humanitarian undertakings, \r\nincluding in Tuvalu and many developing countries, \r\nneed to be recognized as well. As we embark on the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs), Taiwan’s direct and indirect support will \r\ngreatly help in leveraging existing partnerships. Taiwan \r\nis already involved in the work of many specialized \r\nUnited Nations bodies, such as the World Health \r\nOrganization and the International Civil Aviation \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 13/33\r\nOrganization. We therefore truly believe that Taiwan \r\ndeserves international recognition and to become an \r\nactive member of and participant in all the bodies of \r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nIn the same vein, the principle of self-determination \r\nmust also be respected and honoured. This great body \r\ncannot continue to ignore the ongoing violations of \r\nhuman rights in West Papua and that territory’s desire \r\nto achieve self-determination. It must take them into \r\naccount. It must not be blinded by the actions that are \r\nbeing carried out under the guise of the principles of \r\nnon-interference and sovereignty. The United Nations \r\nmust act in this matter and find a workable solution to \r\ngive autonomy to the indigenous peoples of West Papua.\r\nWe are pleased that we now have a united front \r\nwith respect to development, our 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, which is underpinned by \r\nthe key principles of interdependence, universality \r\nand solidarity. No country big or small, rich or poor, \r\ncan achieve its SDGs alone. We must collaborate in \r\ndurable and genuine partnerships on all the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals for the benefit of all. Our urgent \r\nfocus, however, must be on the individuals at the margins \r\nof our societies, who can easily be left behind. We are \r\nindeed their beacon of hope. We must find practical and \r\ntimely remedies that remedy the basic inequities and \r\ninsecurities that persist. Our 2030 Agenda must deliver \r\nin ensuring the fundamental rights and welfare of all \r\ncitizens in current as well as future generations.\r\nOur unity is founded on diversity. The United \r\nNations can only be as effective as the sum of all positive \r\nnational and regional actions put together. We are \r\ngrateful for the work resulting in the SIDS Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway (Samoa \r\nPathway) and believe that, for SIDS like Tuvalu not to \r\nbe left behind, it is critical that the Samoa Pathway be \r\nfully implemented, and that proper provision for SIDS \r\nbe made in all United Nations agencies and programmes.\r\nTuvalu has recently launched its own national \r\nstrategy for sustainable development. It is called Te \r\nKakeega III — meaning “progress” in Tuvalu — and \r\nreflects the 2030 Agenda. Te Kakeega III is based \r\non a theme entitled “Protect and save Tuvalu” and \r\non the principles of local ownership, leadership, \r\ndevelopment and inclusiveness in decision-making, \r\nas well as on mutual trust and respect in working \r\nwith our partners. We acknowledge the invaluable \r\ncontributions of our development partners: Australia, \r\nNew Zealand, Japan, the European Union and the \r\nRepublic of China on Taiwan, together with all other \r\nbilateral and multilateral partners. The ultimate focus \r\nof Te Kakeega III is to fortify the resilience of Tuvalu \r\nand to reduce the vulnerabilities specific to its land \r\nterritory, territorial waters, biodiversity and, most \r\nimportant of all, its people, through education, training \r\nand capacity-building. Tuvalu welcomes durable and \r\ngenuine partnerships with the international community. \r\nAll countries should advance together — though at a \r\ndifferent pace, but progressively nevertheless. Each \r\ncountry must drive its own pursuits, in tune with its \r\nown capabilities and circumstances.\r\nFundamental gaps exist in the achievement of our \r\nMillennium Development Goals (MDGs), especially in \r\nthe least developed countries that are also small island \r\ndeveloping States, like my own country, Tuvalu. While \r\npoverty indices in our countries may have improved, \r\nour atoll nations will forever encounter development \r\ndifficulties, and our level of vulnerabilities and fragility \r\nwill continue to present us with unique challenges, \r\nhowever well-intentioned and well-planned our actions \r\nmay be. Accordingly, special windows of opportunity \r\nfor SIDS and the least developed countries are needed. \r\nWe must not experience again the shortfalls that befell \r\nus under the MDGs. There must be genuine partnerships \r\nto deal with our unique and particular challenges.\r\nIrrespective of how well-intentioned or how \r\nwell written our national strategies for sustainable \r\ndevelopment may be, our efforts and long-term survival \r\nand security will be seriously compromised unless \r\nurgent actions on climate change are taken at all levels. \r\nIn our view, the cause and effects of climate change, \r\nincluding the threats to the survival of people worldwide, \r\nespecially in SIDS, have been thoroughly explained, \r\nfirst in the plethora of United Nations documentation, \r\nand now in the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nThe time for talking is over; it is now time to walk the \r\ntalk and ensure the full elaboration and implementation \r\nof what has been agreed upon. We must ensure that our \r\ncommitments under the Paris Agreement are all met.\r\nTuvalu has exerted every effort to contribute \r\nits voice — however small, however low — at the \r\nglobal level, and we are proud to have been part of the \r\nnegotiations on climate change since the Rio Summit, \r\nand through thick and thin, and heat and cold, until the \r\ntwenty-first session of the Conference of the Parties \r\nto the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, with its successful outcome: the Paris \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n14/33 16-29679\r\nAgreement on Climate Change. Tuvalu was among the \r\nfirst countries to sign and ratify the Paris Agreement \r\nhere in April.\r\nIn practical terms, we are not giving up. We \r\nwill never give up. We are committed to reducing \r\nour greenhouse-gas emissions, as we stated in our \r\nIntended Nationally Determined Contributions, and by \r\n2020 we shall have reached our target of 100 per cent \r\nelectricity generation from renewable sources. Tuvalu \r\nhas also established a Tuvalu Climate Change Survival \r\nFund, using its own meagre financial resources, as a \r\nmechanism to show that we are serious in saving our \r\npeople and enabling them to forever remain on the \r\nislands. The Survival Fund is now also a catalyst to \r\nengage in meaningful partnerships with the world.\r\nHowever, on our own, we are quite unable to \r\nafford the immense cost of adapting to the impacts of \r\nclimate change. In that respect, we are deeply grateful \r\nfor the support that has come bilaterally and from the \r\nagencies of the Council of Regional Organizations in \r\nthe Pacific, from various United Nations bodies in \r\nthe Asia and Pacific region, as well as to the work of \r\nthe Green Climate Fund (GCF) and its Board. Tuvalu \r\nis currently one of only two SIDS in the Pacific with \r\napproved funding for adaptation work on the ground. \r\nWe thank the United Nations Development Programme \r\nfor partnering with Tuvalu in the development of our \r\nproposal. We also thank the two co-Chairs and Board \r\nmembers of GCF, and in particular our own SIDS \r\nrepresentation on the GCF Board, for their favourable \r\nconsideration. While we appreciate past assistance, we \r\ncontinue to need help in building our national capacity \r\nwith respect to writing project proposals and reporting \r\non progress. Let me assure both members and partners \r\nof GCF of Tuvalu’s total commitment to ensuring the \r\nsuccess of the approved project, and, of course, our full \r\ncooperation in future partnerships with GCF.\r\nWe are also very appreciative of the assistance that \r\nwe received following Tropical Cyclone Pam in 2015. \r\nHowever, we believe that there is a need to establish \r\na more systematic mechanism to respond to disasters \r\nin small island development States, particularly those \r\nin the Pacific. We have proposed the establishment of \r\na Pacific climate change insurance facility to help us \r\nreceive assistance in a timely manner during disasters, \r\nwithout having to wait for partnerships and responses \r\nfrom partners.\r\nWe welcome the Oceans Conference to be held \r\nnext year by the United Nations. The Pacific Island \r\ncountries were instrumental in ensuring that oceans \r\nwere included in the SDGs. The oceans provide the \r\nbasis for our life. We therefore stress the need for \r\ncollective action to properly address illegal, unreported \r\nand unregulated fishing, ocean acidification, the \r\nprotection of biodiversity beyond the limits of national \r\njurisdiction, and reforms to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea, so as to protect the \r\nnatural resources of our islands.\r\nInstead of singing the same old tune about good \r\ngovernance and political solutions, we need moral \r\nprobity and soul-searching in dealing with the oceans. \r\nMore than ever, we need the helping hand of Almighty \r\nGod to guide us in our work. We must place God at \r\nthe centre of our human efforts and the endeavours \r\nof the United Nations, to ensure that we successfully \r\nreach our destination together. Next week, Tuvalu will \r\ncelebrate the thirtieth anniversary of its independence. \r\nI ask Members to partner with Tuvalu and with God as \r\nwe journey forward.\r\nI wish the Assembly success in reaching its goals \r\nthe current session. I would like to reiterate that Tuvalu \r\nis fully committed to multilateralism. We believe \r\nthat we cannot survive as a State without our United \r\nNations. If we save Tuvalu, and SIDS, through the \r\nSDGs, particularly through Goal 13, on climate change, \r\nand Goal 14, on oceans, we will save the world. May \r\nGod bless the United Nations. May God bless Tuvalu.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Public Utilities of Tuvalu for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Public Utilities of Tuvalu, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Patrice Emery Trovoada, Prime \r\nMinister of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe.\r\nMr. Patrice Emery Trovoada, Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 15/33\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Patrice Emery \r\nTrovoada, Prime Minister of the Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, and inviting him to address the Assembly. \r\nMr. Trovoada (Sao Tome and Principe) (spoke \r\nin French): Allow me, at this seventy-first session of \r\nthe General Assembly, to congratulate, on behalf of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nPresident Peter Thomson on his election and to wish \r\nhim every success. We hope that during his presidency \r\nour Organization will be able to address and resolve \r\nthe major issues that affect our respective peoples and \r\nour planet as a whole, following on from the adoption \r\nin 2015 of the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030.\r\nMy delegation would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to pay homage to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his sustained efforts throughout his \r\ntwo terms of office to help our Organization grow \r\nand reinforce its role and action, focusing on peace, \r\ndemocracy and the protection of life in all its forms \r\nand elements.\r\nThe annual convening of the General Assembly \r\ncan in many respects be interpreted by the people that \r\nwe represent as an act of powerlessness, arising from \r\nthe fact that the world continues to live in tension, \r\nwith more than its fair share of indescribable suffering \r\non a daily basis, as a result of past conflicts, new \r\nconflicts and poorly managed conflicts. At a time \r\nwhen the treatment of refugees f leeing war or hunger \r\nor both collides with populism and extremism, the \r\ndemocracies of rich countries appear to provide false \r\nresponses to real problems, rendering them even more \r\ncomplex, stigmatizing and isolating our fellow peoples \r\nas simplistic slogans and reductive schemes increase \r\ndivisions between peoples, civilizations and cultures.\r\nWe are pleased that the high-level plenary meeting \r\non addressing large movements of refugees and migrants \r\nwas held here at Headquarters a few days ago. But the \r\nUnited Nations, and particularly the Security Council, \r\nmust do more to bring definitive settlements to the \r\nconflicts that are fuelling terrorism, the disappearance \r\nof States and the despair of populations. In this sense, \r\nwe await the urgent adoption of the comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism.\r\nWe believe it to be essential that our Organization \r\nestablish more binding mechanisms to ensure effective \r\nsolidarity with the victims of war and terrorism and \r\nbring about solutions for old and recent conflicts, \r\nparticularly the Israel-Palestine conflict and those in \r\nSyria and Libya, as well as the emergence of terrorist \r\ngroups in the Sahel. Because of these conflicts, we are \r\ncompelled to deploy a prevention policy to ensure that \r\nother issues of conflict do not arise. We must ensure on \r\na permanent basis that States respect the integrity of \r\nhuman beings and the right to freedom of expression and \r\nto regular, just and transparent elections, and that post-\r\nconflict commitments are fulfilled by stakeholders.\r\nWe are pleased to witness the return of peace \r\nand the conclusion of the electoral process in the \r\nCentral African Republic. We encourage support for \r\nthe achievement of better conditions for the free and \r\npeaceful elections in the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, and we reaffirm our commitment to the dialogue \r\nand consultations between neighbouring States in order \r\nto stabilize South Sudan, Burundi and Somalia. We \r\nalso welcome the Colombian peace agreement and the \r\nrapprochement between Cuba and the United States \r\nof America.\r\nHumankind has always made genuine progress \r\nwhen peaceful coexistence and quest for solutions are \r\nprioritized, thanks to the opening of hearts and minds \r\nto differences, innovation, tolerance and respect for \r\nothers. We strongly believe in our Organization as the \r\nideal vehicle for bringing harmony to our world through \r\nrespect for differences, cultures and government models \r\nand systems, as well as by constructing intelligent \r\nsolutions based on cooperation and exchanges that \r\ngenerate wealth, prosperity and sustainable peace \r\nfor everyone.\r\nThe role accorded to sustainable development at \r\nthe two most recent sessions of the General Assmebly \r\ndemonstrates the undeniable spirit of inclusion that \r\ndrives us. However, it is clear that this belief in inclusion \r\nand the quest for sustainable development, peace and \r\nsecurity cannot become a reality unless we reform our \r\nOrganization. We must make it more credible, more \r\neffective, more efficient and more representative, \r\nin particular by ending a situation in which Africa \r\nis the sole continent without a permanent seat on the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMy country, Sao Tome and Principe, is a young \r\ndemocracy that has been functioning for almost 26 \r\nyears. In August, it again held democratic elections, in \r\nwhich it elected its fourth President of the Republic. \r\nDespite being an island State, the second-smallest \r\nState in Africa and a State without mineral resources, \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n16/33 16-29679\r\nwe have nevertheless made remarkable progress in \r\nhuman development, with a school enrolment rate of \r\nover 97 per cent, an electricity coverage rate of over \r\n60 per cent, an Internet penetration rate that is growing \r\nexponentially, one of the lowest rates of malaria in Africa \r\nand recognized advances in matters of governance and \r\nbusiness climate. We are without a doubt on track to \r\nmeeting the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\r\nAlthough the challenges of democracy and \r\npolitical stability are assured by the solidity of our \r\ninstitutions, the vibrance of our civil society and the \r\ngood sense of our political establishment, Government \r\nand opposition alike, this does not necessarily translate \r\nto economic gain, particularly when it comes to long-\r\nterm financing, which we need for the building of \r\ninfrastructure in order to attract the private investment \r\nthat will generate employment for young people and \r\nwealth and tax revenue for the State. This leads us to \r\nconclude that, when 60 per cent of the population is \r\nunder the age of 20, there can be no lasting democratic \r\ngains unless there is economic growth on a sustained \r\nbasis — a situation that cannot be ignored owing to \r\nits highly destabilizing nature in the event of failed \r\ndevelopment policies.\r\nMy Government has been doing its part by engaging \r\nin action, undertaking reforms and achieving results. \r\nNevertheless, we invite developed countries to ensure \r\nthat their commitments to sustainable development \r\nfunding are fulfilled through, inter alia, the diverse \r\nmechanisms announced following the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development and during the twenty-\r\nfirst session of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange in Paris. We also call upon multilateral financial \r\ninstitutions to increase their concessional lending.\r\nA universal push to transform our world \r\ndepends principally on the mobilization of financial \r\nresources. The necessary financial windfall, capable \r\nof electrifying our continent, irrigating its fields, \r\ncombating its endemic diseases, eliminating its hunger \r\nand promoting professional training, does exist. We see \r\nit every day in the capital markets and in the economic \r\nand financial press. Let us therefore act now. Access to \r\ndevelopment loans is the only response, and it will also \r\nhelp to relaunch the global economy with the necessary \r\nconditions for risk mitigation, good governance and the \r\nfight against illicit financial f lows.\r\nAfrica, my continent, is lagging behind in \r\npractically all the human development indexes. This \r\nsame Africa paid a heavy price for its contribution to \r\nthe development of other nations for centuries. But let \r\nus not dwell on the past; let us instead exercise common \r\nsense and be expedient. Africa is still a continent of \r\nopportunity for all, with its mineral resources, arable \r\nlands, forest, rivers and, above all, its youth.\r\nThis year we will be called upon to elect a new \r\nSecretary-General, and this election must take place \r\nin ideal objective conditions in order to galvanize all \r\nthe support needed to carry out this difficult but noble \r\nand vital mission of delivering peace and development \r\nto humankind.\r\nSao Tome and Principe reiterates its commitment \r\nto the international community and to working towards \r\nbuilding a world that is better for everyone. May our \r\nhard work bear fruit.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Patrice Emery Trovoada, Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Ms. Delcy Eloina Rodriguez \r\nGómez, Political Vice-President and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Political Vice-President and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela.\r\nMs. Delcy Eloina Rodriguez Gómez, Political \r\nVice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming Her Excellency Ms. Delcy Eloina \r\nRodriguez Gómez, Political Vice-President and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela, and inviting her to address the Assembly.\r\nMs. Rodríguez Gómez (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): On behalf of Mr. Nicolás \r\nMaduro Moros, President of the Bolivarian Republic of \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 17/33\r\nVenezuela, I would like to congratulate the President on \r\nhis election to lead the work of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session. We would like to express \r\nour firm resolve to contribute to the success of his \r\nleadership and thereby to strengthening the Assembly’s \r\nauthority as the most representative and democratic \r\norgan of the United Nations.\r\nWe are in the sacred home of the multilateral system, \r\nrepresenting a banner for fundamental principles in the \r\ninternational relations between sovereign and equal \r\nStates. The Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela endorses \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which uphold respect for the right of States \r\nto self-determination, sovereignty, independence \r\nand territorial integrity as the fundamental basis for \r\nensuring peaceful coexistence among nations in the \r\ncontext of a multinational system. As a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council since January 2015, \r\nVenezuela has worked to reaffirm the primacy of \r\nsovereignty, political independence, self-determination \r\nand the peaceful resolution of disputes.\r\nA year ago, here in the General Assembly Hall, \r\nour Heads of State and Government adopted the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, with the ultimate \r\ngoal of eradicating hunger and poverty, and noting \r\nthat the Agenda must be people-centred, universal \r\nand transformative. However, I would like to focus \r\nour attention on the chief obstacle preventing the \r\nworld from achieving those noble goals. The capitalist \r\nmodel is a huge impediment to our peoples’ right to \r\ndevelopment. It creates profound inequalities and is a \r\nthreat to the very existence of the planet and the human \r\nspecies. In the past 50 years, the consumption generated \r\nby capitalism has succeeded in melting the polar ice \r\ncaps and creating unsustainable climate conditions \r\non our planet. In the words of Pope Francis in his \r\nencyclical Laudato si’, man’s actions and his models \r\nof production and consumption have turned the planet \r\ninto a huge garbage heap. That model is sustained and \r\ndeveloped through the expansion of violence in its \r\nvarious manifestations, both in internal conflicts and \r\nwidespread warfare.\r\nIn 2015 global military spending reached \r\n$1.7 trillion, one third of which — $600 billion, for some \r\ncountries an almost unimaginably huge figure — was \r\nspent by the United States alone to finance its wars \r\nand acts of imperial aggression. The United States \r\nhas about 800 military bases around the world, whose \r\nmaintenance costs about $100 billion a year. It was not \r\nwithout reason that in 1968 Martin Luther King said \r\nthat the United States is the largest exporter of violence \r\nin the world.\r\nThe death totals in conflicts over the past five \r\ncenturies reveal the intrinsic link between violence and \r\nthe expansion of capitalism. The sixteenth century saw \r\n1.6 million people die as a result of conflict. The figure \r\nfor the seventeenth century was 6.1 million; for the \r\neighteenth, 7 million; for the nineteenth, 19.4 million, \r\nand for the twentieth, 109.7 million. That tragic story \r\nof deadly violence has gone hand in hand with the \r\nexpansion of capitalism and its financial effects. The \r\nratio of the victims of deadly violence as a percentage of \r\nthe total population therefore increased over those five \r\ncenturies from 0.32 to 4.35, making for an increasingly \r\nviolent world. The forms that wars take today have also \r\nchanged. Internal conflicts now predominate, and they \r\nhappen more often in poor countries. To give just one \r\nexample, a 2005 United Nations report cites a tragic \r\nfigure illustrating the relationship between violence \r\nand capitalism — of the 3 million people killed by \r\nconflicts since 1990, 2 million were children.\r\nCapitalism is a serious threat to the future of \r\nhumankind. Terrorism, that heinous expression of \r\ndeadly violence, has also changed, becoming more \r\nviolent and more widespread, attacking countries \r\nthat are poor or have been ruined, and focusing on \r\ngeopolitical ends in order to bring about the collapse of \r\nStates and their institutions and to enable terrorists to \r\nexpropriate their strategic resources illegally. Venezuela \r\nrejects terrorism in all its forms and condemns the \r\ndouble standard whereby the centres of hegemonic \r\npower establish an artificial dividing line for terrorism, \r\nwhich is good if it agrees with their desire to overthrow \r\nGovernments that are not aligned with their interests, \r\nand bad when unwanted boomerang effects victimize \r\ntheir own populations.\r\nAs we have seen, capitalism is deadly for peace. \r\nIn the past five centuries of the capitalist model’s \r\nexpansion, lethal violence has claimed ever more \r\nvictims and significantly worsened inequalities. Its \r\ngreatest contradiction is demonstrated by the fact that \r\ntoday the world produces enough to sustain every \r\nperson on the planet; but that wealth ends up in just \r\na few hands, and poverty is now concentrated mainly \r\nin the countries of the South and within those of the \r\ncentre. The gap between rich and poor has therefore \r\ngrown disproportionately. The case of the United States \r\nis compelling; between 1942 and 2010 the gap there \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n18/33 16-29679\r\ntripled. To give an example, in 1978, the annual earnings \r\nof an average member of the working class and a top \r\nexecutive were $48,000 and $393,000, respectively. in \r\n2010, that average worker made $33,000, while a senior \r\nexecutive was paid more than $1.1 million.\r\nAccording to Oxfam, 1 per cent of the world’s \r\ninhabitants owns the same amount of wealth as 90 per \r\ncent of the rest. But the most significant part is that \r\nthis figure is not uniform around the world. It is worse \r\nin developing countries and in some sectors even \r\nworse that that, where the chasm between those who \r\nare squandering the world’s wealth and those who are \r\ndying of hunger is tragic. Concentrated capital has \r\nbeen turned into unproductive and speculative wealth \r\nthat has a pernicious effect on economic sectors such \r\nas communications, energy, banking and investment, \r\namong others. It has become a way of increasing wealth \r\nwithout producing anything. It is a model based on \r\nviolence, where peace has become a distant dream for \r\nhumankind. To see that, we have only to consider the \r\nconflicts that are currently the worst threats to global \r\npeace and stability.\r\nThe question of Palestine is an ongoing issue for the \r\nwhole of humankind. The daily lives of the Palestinian \r\npeople, as they try to resist dreadful violence, are marked \r\nby war crimes and massive human rights violations. To \r\ngive just one example, in 2000 the illegal occupation \r\nresulted in enormous setbacks to human development, \r\nwith a poverty rate that went from 20 to 55 per cent \r\nin only three years. That figure has now worsened. \r\nWe do not have the time needed to detail the numbers \r\nand types of violations of human rights that are being \r\ncommitted hourly against the Palestinian people.\r\nVenezuela supports Palestine’s right of self-\r\ndetermination as a free, sovereign and independent \r\nState, and we therefore believe that the Organization \r\nmust take the decision as soon as possible to admit \r\nit to the United Nations as a full-f ledged State. We \r\nsupport the establishment of a State of Palestine within \r\nsecure, internationally recognized pre-1967 borders, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital. We call on Israel to \r\nend its protracted occupation of territories belonging \r\nto the State of Palestine. The Israeli occupation of \r\nthose territories and its related policies are the leading \r\ncause of violations of Palestinians’ human rights and \r\nof international humanitarian law. Venezuela also calls \r\nfor the definitive lifting of the illegal blockade that has \r\nbeen imposed on the Gaza Strip since 2007 and is a \r\nf lagrant violation of the people’s human rights. There \r\nwill be no peace in the Middle East if Israel continues \r\nto deny the Palestinian people their human rights, \r\nincluding their right to self-determination.\r\nWith respect to Iraq, the rationale for the second \r\ninvasion of the country, in 2003, had as its starting point \r\na truth that, not only was not verified at the time but, \r\nyears later, was acknowledged by the main invaders \r\nto be a lie. That military invasion was preceded by an \r\neffective propaganda campaign focused on four main \r\nareas. None of the arguments was true. The weapons of \r\nmass destruction that led to the invasion of Iraq never \r\nexisted. What is traditionally referred to as intelligence \r\nbecame war propaganda. The large media corporations, \r\nacting like veritable monopolies for moulding public \r\nopinion, developed genuine campaigns that preceded \r\nand justified the imperialist interventions.\r\nWith respect to Libya, in 2011, the North Atlantic \r\nTreaty Organization carried out a military intervention, \r\nplunging the nation into violence, making it a victim \r\nof terrorist groups, reducing its human development \r\nindex and disrupting its cooperation mechanisms with \r\nother neighbouring countries of Mother Africa. In the \r\npast, Libya maintained oil-production levels close to \r\n1.6 million barrels per day. In August 2016, production \r\nhardly reached 260,000 barrels per day. Yet again, the \r\nimperialist obstinacy of the Western Powers curtails \r\nthe right to development of peoples, the right to peace \r\nand the right to a homeland. Migration f lows of Libyan \r\ncitizens seeking a better future beyond its borders have \r\nalso affected poverty levels in developed countries. The \r\nserious humanitarian situations in Afghanistan and \r\nYemen also deserve equal mention.\r\nOn another note, the Syrian Arab Republic is waging \r\na full-f ledged war against the barbarism of the terrorism \r\nplaguing the country. The Syrian people are the primary \r\nvictims of the violence perpetrated by terrorist groups, \r\nwhich are committing war crimes through the use of \r\nchemical weapons. Terrorism in Syria has caused one \r\nof the largest humanitarian tragedies in recent decades, \r\nwhich has resulted in 6 million internally displaced \r\npersons and 4.8 million refugees f leeing widespread \r\nviolence to save their lives, regardless of the risks they \r\nface. The dramatic images of men, women and children \r\ntrying to cross the Mediterranean reflect the gravity \r\nof the armed conflict in this Arab country caused by \r\nterrorist groups and violent opposition. Overcoming \r\nthe humanitarian tragedy of 13.5 million Syrian \r\ncitizens depends on terrorism being vanquished and \r\na political and peaceful solution to the armed conflict \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 19/33\r\nthat respects the sovereignty and territorial integrity of \r\nthat brother country.\r\nBy contrast, Venezuela welcomes the renewal of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States and our \r\nsister Republic of Cuba as the only way to overcome and \r\nresolve the differences between the States. For decades, \r\nthe Cuban people have resisted, with dignity and \r\nheroism, the ravages of State terrorism from the North \r\nwhose aim it was to attack its development, political, \r\nsocial and cultural models. The Cuban people continue \r\nto be subjected to a criminal economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade. Venezuela demands that the \r\nUnited States put an end to the blockade and offer \r\ncompensation for the damage caused by such illegal \r\nand arrogant actions.\r\nThe United Nations system is facing major \r\nchallenges. Sixteen years ago, at the Millennium \r\nSummit, President Hugo Chávez Frías said that the \r\nUnited Nations could not find its way with a map that \r\nwas drawn in the historic moment following the end \r\nof the Second World War in 1945 (see A/55/PV.8). In \r\norder to successfully address the complex challenges \r\nin the areas of peace, stability and humankind’s \r\neconomic and social development, it is vital for the \r\nOrganization to be renewed and strengthened, and \r\nthat will be achieved by reforming its principal bodies. \r\nIn that regard, we call for a comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council. In addition to other reforms to \r\nbe undertaken within the Council itself, the Council \r\nshould include developing countries in Africa, Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean and Asia. As the General \r\nAssembly is the democratic and universal body par \r\nexcellence of the Organization, our country reaffirms \r\nits position in favour of strengthening the authority of \r\nthe Assembly in the various areas conferred to it by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, namely, peace and \r\nsecurity, economic and social development, human \r\nrights and international cooperation.\r\nBy contrast, approaches relying on double \r\nstandards and the political use of human rights to \r\njustify interventionism in our countries in order to \r\nserve imperialist interests seriously undermine the \r\nOrganization’s institutions, making it a real challenge \r\nto safeguard and protect the human rights of peoples \r\nand not just individual rights and those of the global \r\nelites. It is urgent for the United Nations system to \r\ntake measures against global Powers that, regardless \r\nof the rules and international law, mount attacks on \r\nGovernments that express the will of their people.\r\nThe soon-to-be-elected new Secretary-General \r\nwill face major challenges and so too will free and \r\nsovereign countries whose main responsibility is to \r\nwork together towards a noble and imperious end. \r\nVenezuela thanks Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis efforts to promote international peace and security. \r\nIt must be acknowledged that the United Nations has \r\nmade great contributions to humankind. Its intrinsic \r\npurposes of peace and security are founded on a strong \r\nmultilateral system that sets the international rule of \r\nlaw by regulating relations among States. We join in the \r\nefforts to preserve the rule of law and advance towards \r\na better system.\r\nJust days ago, in Margarita, we hosted the \r\nseventeenth Summit of Heads of State and Government \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. Venezuela chaired that \r\nimportant group of countries, with which we share the \r\nsame concerns. We made significant progress and we \r\nremain committed to peace, development, solidarity and \r\nthe welfare of our people, within the framework of the \r\nBandung Principles on which our group was founded. \r\nIn 1946, Albert Einstein asserted, “I firmly believe that \r\nthe majority of peoples in the world would prefer to live \r\nin peace and security”. Humankind’s desire for peace \r\ncan be possible only by creating a global Government, \r\nto which the peoples of the South, who account for \r\ntwo thirds of the Members of the Organization, are \r\nfirmly committed.\r\nIt should be noted that during the course of today’s \r\nmeeting, a United States plane violated Venezuelan \r\nairspace. This same day, United States aircraft attacked \r\nthe Syrian national army, killing dozens of Syrians \r\nand wounding hundreds more. In that same time \r\nperiod, India was the victim of a terrorist attack, and \r\nthe Palestinian people suffered violent attacks that left \r\nsome of its citizens dead. As the Assembly can see, the \r\npeoples of the South, who possess the largest energy, \r\nmining, gas and water reserves on the planet, are the \r\nmain victims of imperialist violence and aggression.\r\nOver a year ago, the President of the United States, \r\nMr. Barack Hussein Obama, issued an executive order \r\ndescribing Venezuela as a threat to the national security \r\nand foreign policy of the United States. That executive \r\norder was rejected by most countries around the world. \r\nIn addition, extreme and violent groups are supported \r\nand encouraged by the United States to sow the seeds of \r\ndeath in Venezuela by overthrowing the constitutional \r\nGovernment of President Nicolás Maduro Moros and \r\nemploying multifaceted economic aggression and \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n20/33 16-29679\r\nsophisticated methods to discredit and weaken the \r\ncountry and incite a media, trade and financial boycott. \r\nIt is nothing that has not already been experienced in \r\nthe past in our region, when our President Salvador \r\nAllende suffered the same attacks from the imperialist \r\nUnited States.\r\nWe warn the international community that \r\nVenezuela has been chosen as a new imperialist target \r\nin order to undermine its sovereignty and bring about its \r\nterritorial disintegration, with a view to illegitimately \r\nand violently seizing the immense, strategic natural \r\nresources we possess. Imperialist history, replete \r\nwith violence, is expected to be repeated — a major \r\ncampaign of lies and fallacies is under way against \r\nVenezuela, its people and its Government. That agenda \r\nof aggression makes it an unconventional war aimed \r\nat criminalizing and penalizing our development model \r\nfounded on the basis of twenty-first-century socialism \r\nthat is profoundly inclusive, distributes wealth to the \r\nmajority and is based on equality.\r\nOur continent has had very rocky relationships with \r\nthe United States, which in service of its expansionism \r\nand imperial domination, subjugated and invaded many \r\nof our countries. Those dark pages of colonialism and \r\nsubjugation have been overcome by the decision of \r\nour peoples to be free and independent. Nevertheless, \r\nnew war drums are rumbling in the North, which \r\naspires to revisiting and traversing the rocky roads \r\nour America has already travelled. We condemn the \r\nparliamentary judicial coup d’état in Brazil, and we \r\nreject the implementation of a new Operation Condor in \r\nour region, controlled from Washington. I would note \r\nthat Venezuela is criticized for having one of the most \r\nequitable wealth distributions in Latin America, with a \r\nGini coefficient of 0.38.\r\nIn 2005, UNESCO declared our country free of \r\nilliteracy. Today, our school enrolment, according to \r\nUNESCO, stands at 77 per cent for children ages 3 \r\nto 6, 96 per cent for ages 6 to 12, and 76 per cent for \r\nages 12 to 18. We have 2.6 million students in higher \r\neducation, placing us among the leading countries \r\nin the world in this regard. In 2012, the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) \r\nsingled out Venezuela for its social policies to reduce \r\nhunger and poverty by over 50 per cent throughout its \r\nnational territory. In 2015, the FAO once again praised \r\nthe Government of President Nicolás Maduro Moros for \r\nthe exceptional progress made in reducing hunger and \r\npoverty.\r\nIn our country, our free health-care plan is available \r\nto 75 per cent of the population, and will soon reach \r\n100 per cent, thanks to a joint programme with our \r\nCuban brothers. Our social-housing programme has \r\nbenefitted 1,111,095 families. We have placed particular \r\nemphasis on protecting retired persons and the elderly. \r\nIn 17 years, over 3 million persons in that age group \r\nhave benefited from this programme.\r\nWe offer hope to the vast majority of people who \r\nare victims of a ruthless model of humanity. From \r\nVenezuela, we seek true peace among all peoples and \r\nthe establishment of a new economic, cultural and \r\ncommunication model in service of peace, development \r\nand equality. We are developing partnerships through \r\ninnovative mechanisms such as the Bolivarian \r\nAlternative for the Peoples of Our America and the \r\nPetroCaribe Energy Cooperation Agreement, which \r\nbenefit the peoples of our region.\r\nWe also support the efforts of Brazil, Russia, India, \r\nChina and South Africa towards the establishment of \r\na multipolar, multicentric world. From Venezuela, \r\nwe wage permanent war on the capitalist system that \r\nperpetuates poverty, violence and unhappiness. We \r\necho the words of our liberator, Simón Bolívar, when \r\nwe say that the most perfect system of Government is \r\none which produces the greatest sum happiness, social \r\nsecurity and political stability.\r\nLet us give the world the greatest possible sum \r\nhappiness, social security and political stability. The \r\ntime for peace with social justice is upon us. Let us \r\nchange the system and become true militants for peace.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Political Vice-President \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela for the statement she has \r\njust made.\r\nMs. Delcy Eloina Rodriguez Gómez, Political \r\nVice-President and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum. \r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdulaziz Kamilov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Uzbekistan.\r\nMr. Kamilov (Uzbekistan): I would like to begin \r\nmy speech by conveying my deep gratitude to the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, and to all heads of State and Government who \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 21/33\r\nhave sent their condolences to the Uzbek people on the \r\noccasion of the untimely passing of the first President \r\nof the independent Uzbekistan, Islam Karimov. Under \r\nhis leadership, Uzbekistan embarked upon the path of \r\nconfident independent development and was recognized \r\nas a sovereign State and full-f ledged Member of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe President of Uzbekistan spoke from this high \r\nrostrum many times. In this very Hall, he announced a \r\nnumber of important international political initiatives \r\naimed at establishing a nuclear-weapon-free zone \r\nin Central Asia, promoting peace in Afghanistan, \r\novercoming the consequences of the Aral Sea \r\necological disaster and bolstering the effectiveness \r\nof international cooperation in the struggle against \r\ninternational terrorism, extremism and drug trafficking. \r\nAll of those proposals, put forward by the leader of \r\nUzbekistan, were fully supported by the international \r\ncommunity and, today, are making a tangible practical \r\ncontribution to ensuring common peace, stability and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nIn the 25 years under Karimov’s leadership, \r\nUzbekistan became a modern and dynamically \r\ndeveloping State. As Acting President of Uzbekistan \r\nShavkat Mirziyoev underscored at a recent session of \r\nour Parliament, in the years following its independence \r\nUzbekistan’s economy grew by a factor of six. The real \r\nincome per capita rose by a factor of nine. Over the \r\nlast 11 years, gross domestic product growth rates have \r\nremained above 8 per cent. According to estimates, this \r\nyear’s growth rates will continue the same trend. As the \r\nSecretary-General acknowledged in his congratulatory \r\nmessage on the occasion of Uzbekistan’s twenty-fifth \r\njubilee anniversary of independence, our country has \r\nmade steady progress in the implementation of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals.\r\nI would now like to briefly touch upon some \r\nimportant issues.\r\nFirst of all, Uzbekistan will maintain its consistent \r\nforeign policy aimed at the protection and advancement \r\nof the country’s fundamental interests. Its foreign policy \r\nis grounded in a firm commitment to the fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law as enshrined in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and in the Constitution \r\nof the Republic of Uzbekistan, as well as in all \r\ninternational legal instruments to which Uzbekistan is \r\na signatory. As Acting President Mirziyoev has stated, \r\nUzbekistan will continue to promote friendships and \r\nconstructive cooperation with all foreign countries, on \r\nthe basis of the principles of mutual respect, equality \r\nand interests.\r\nUzbekistan is a firm believer in not interfering in the \r\ninternal affairs of other States and addressing emerging \r\ntensions and conflict only through peaceful and \r\npolitical means. Our country has made the principled \r\nand unambiguous choice not to join any military-\r\npolitical blocs or alliances, not to allow the stationing \r\nof foreign military bases on its territory and not to send \r\nour servicemen beyond the country’s borders.\r\nSecondly, Afghanistan was and continues to be one \r\nof the main threats to international security and stability. \r\nRegrettably, we see little hope for the resolution of that \r\ncountry’s accumulated contradictions any time soon. \r\nThe settlement of the Afghan conflict will be possible \r\nonly if it is based on an intra-Afghan national accord \r\nand attained through peaceful political negotiations \r\namong the major hostile groups, under the auspices \r\nof the United Nations, and, very importantly, without \r\nany preliminary conditions. This is important so that \r\nthe donor countries and international institutions can \r\ncommit to allocating assistance to Afghanistan aimed \r\nat real socioeconomic improvement and the raising of \r\nliving standards of the population. Above all, assistance \r\nmust be channelled to education and learning.\r\nPeace in Afghanistan will bring tangible benefits \r\nto all countries of the Eurasian continent. Sustainable \r\npeace and stability in Afghanistan will stimulate \r\nthe construction of motorways and railroads, the \r\ndevelopment of regional and transregional commerce \r\nand the establishment of numerous pipelines going \r\nin all directions. In that regard, the international \r\ncommunity should start seeing Afghanistan, not as a \r\nsource of regional problems, threats and challenges, \r\nbut rather as a unique strategic opportunity that ends \r\nthe status quo once and for all and establishes the basis \r\nfor multilateral relations that will allow us to attain our \r\ngoals of prosperity and well-being for all.\r\nThirdly, the protection and preservation of the \r\nenvironment has a central place in the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals for the period between 2016 and \r\n2030, as adopted by the General Assembly last year. \r\nThe tragedy of the Aral Sea is a vivid example. The \r\nsignificant ecological, climatic, socioeconomic and \r\nhumanitarian consequences of the tragedy have been \r\na direct threat to the sustainable development of the \r\nregion and to the health, gene pool and future of the \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n22/33 16-29679\r\npeople residing there. The most important task today is \r\nto preserve the natural biological diversity of the Aral \r\nSea region, reduce the environmental impacts of the \r\nAral Sea tragedy, and, most importantly, preserve the \r\nmany vital activities that allow millions of people in the \r\nregion to survive.\r\nFourthly, the Republic of Uzbekistan supports the \r\nstrengthening of the entire United Nations system. \r\nWe must reinforce its structures’ role in addressing \r\nregional and international security problems and \r\nensuring sustainable development. For some time now, \r\nUzbekistan has supported institutional reform at the \r\nUnited Nations to ensure efficiency in its work and a \r\nbetter functioning in the way its principal bodies — the \r\nGeneral Assembly and Security Council — interact. \r\nFurthermore, the General Assembly must preserve its \r\ncentral role as a major advisory, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative body, while the Security Council must be \r\nreformed step by step, including through its expansion.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Guillaume Long, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nHuman Mobility of the Republic of Ecuador.\r\nMr. Long (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): I bring \r\ngreetings from President Rafael Correa and an embrace \r\nfrom the people of Ecuador to all sister nations of \r\nour United Nations. The past decade of the citizens’ \r\nrevolution in Ecuador has shown us that to achieve \r\ndevelopment we must do everything opposite to the \r\nprescription that the neoliberal hegemony has given us \r\nin the past few years.\r\nIn the past decade of our own sovereign drafting \r\nof the Ecuadorian social contract, we have managed \r\nto restore faith and hope in a country that had been \r\ndevastated. We have found that this hope can be \r\ntranslated into tangible results for our peoples, \r\nthrough the reduction of poverty and inequality, the \r\nredistribution of the fruits of economic growth, job \r\ncreation, unprecedented access to public services and \r\nthe guarantee of rights, free education and health care. \r\nWe have recovered a demoralized country, which, \r\nafter going through seven presidents in 10 years, a \r\nbanking crisis created by our elites, who expelled \r\nhundreds of thousands of migrants from our country, \r\nthe loss of sovereignty and the implantation of foreign \r\nmilitary bases in our territory, opted to found a vibrant \r\ndemocracy and sovereign republic in the global system.\r\nTo do so, we had to break with the paradigms of \r\na neoliberal ideological fundamentalism. Power is not \r\nonly military and financial; it is above all the dominion \r\nof ideas. Power is hegemonic when it has the ability \r\nto generate consensus and common understandings and \r\nexplain our history and our environment. To do this, the \r\nhegemonic Powers have appropriated words that we all \r\nuse and imbued them with meaning in order to impose a \r\npolitical and moral agenda upon the planet. That is why, \r\nfrom the South, from the periphery, we must challenge \r\nthe meaning of the major concepts that are often \r\nbandied about in this General Assembly. We must, for \r\nexample, challenge the concept of “development”. To \r\nensure that we are all following the same prescription \r\nthey have tried to convince us that development is a \r\ntechnical issue, when it is primarily a political problem.\r\nIn Latin America, the most unequal region in the \r\nworld, there can be no genuine sustainable development, \r\nsocial cohesion and political stability without \r\nredistribution. And that redistribution often means \r\nconflict with elites, who have historically opposed \r\nand continue to oppose relinquishing an iota of their \r\npower. It is no coincidence that Latin America — which \r\nI insist is the most unequal region of the world — has, \r\nfor example, an average tax rate of 20 per cent of gross \r\ndomestic product (GDP), when industrialized countries \r\nhave rates of 30 per cent, 40 per cent or 50 per cent \r\nof GDP while the average rate for countries of the \r\nEuropean Union is 39 per cent. But any rise in the tax \r\nrate to ensure that Latin American States can deliver \r\nrights, redistribute wealth or stimulate the economy, \r\nis resisted by our elites who mobilize all the resources \r\nat their disposal, including through the private media, \r\nthe most powerful tool to maintain the status quo \r\nand destabilize Governments that dare to challenge \r\ntheir interests.\r\nTo achieve development, we have to break with the \r\nprimary exporter model of capital accumulation. We \r\nmust diversify our economies, change our production \r\nmodel and move away from an excessive dependence \r\non raw materials. This idle profiteering, which is \r\noften based on cheap labour and unstable work and the \r\nbounties of nature rather than the innovative capacity \r\nof our people, means that our elites also oppose any \r\ndeep-rooted productive transformations to achieve \r\ndevelopment.\r\nIn fact, the countries that have achieved \r\ndevelopment — in both the nineteenth and twentieth \r\ncenturies, in North America and in Europe, and more \r\nrecently in East Asia — used aggressive protectionist \r\nmeans to build their nascent industries, with an active \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 23/33\r\nregulatory and planning role for the State, with a \r\ndisrespect for intellectual property that would make \r\nus blush today. But here is the irony: when those same \r\ncountries achieved their development — as soon as \r\nthey achieved a position of dominance with respect \r\nto productivity and competitiveness of their new \r\nindustries — they joined the ahistorical narrative of \r\ndevelopment that I just mentioned.\r\nFriends of the global South, if we are to diversify \r\nour economies and change our models of production, \r\nlet us do what they did and not what the countries that \r\nachieved development are telling us we must do. First \r\nand foremost, development is a political issue. One \r\ngood example of that is the problem of tax evasion and \r\ntax havens. It is estimated that in the case of Ecuador an \r\namount equivalent to 30 per cent of our gross domestic \r\nproduct — that is to say, one third of our economy — is \r\nbeing hidden — that is the precise word — in tax havens. \r\nImagine the dynamic economic progress that could \r\nbe made, how much poverty and inequality could be \r\nreduced, if that money had been invested in our country \r\nand if taxes had been paid.\r\nWe are now dealing with the challenge of rebuilding \r\nthe zones of our country that suffered a terrible \r\nearthquake last April. The Economic Commission for \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean calculates that the \r\ncost of reconstruction will be at least $3.3 billion, which \r\nmeans we have to make huge efforts and sacrifices for \r\nour country. But then there are the $30 billion hidden \r\nin tax havens.\r\nBut to put an end to such tax havens and to have \r\ncritical resources for our development, we have to wage \r\na political battle. It is good that some countries are \r\ncommitted to cooperation in the interest of development \r\nbut there still is not one drop of assistance in an ocean \r\nof injustices, including financial, banking and tax \r\npractices that undermine our right to development. \r\nAnd then there are the practices by the same States to \r\noffset the phenomenon of capital f light resulting from \r\nbanking secrecy and the low-to-zero tax rates with new, \r\nabsolutely negligible cooperation.\r\nEcuador reiterates its call for the establishment of \r\nan intergovernmental body within the United Nations \r\nfor tax justice — a democratic institutional structure \r\nthat puts an end to the shameful practice of tax havens \r\nin the twenty-first century. Ecuador has taken the \r\nrevolutionary decision to conduct a referendum in \r\nFebruary 2017 to consult with our people whether \r\nthey would agree with prohibiting all public servants, \r\nincluding those who were popularly elected, from \r\nholding capital and assets in tax havens. We are proud \r\nto present our ethical pact to the world. We are hoping \r\nthat it would be an example of one way of fighting \r\nagainst global plutocracy, speculative capitalism and \r\nfaceless, nameless, amoral, unethical capital that is \r\nhidden in order to avoid responsibility.\r\nAnother concept that is often manipulated for \r\nabsolutely political purposes is that of human rights. \r\nAbsolutely all political action in our Citizens’ Revolution \r\nhas been thought through from the perspective of human \r\nrights. Our Constitution is one of the most advanced in \r\nthe world with respect to guaranteeing human rights, \r\nand it is the first Constitution to guarantee the rights \r\nof nature. Our Constitution establishes human rights as \r\ncomprehensive and multidimensional, which means that \r\nimportance is given to all rights — civil and political \r\nrights, of course, but also economic and social rights.\r\nWe believe that one cannot speak of guaranteeing \r\nhuman rights, especially in the context of Latin \r\nAmerica, without speaking about the reduction of \r\npoverty and inequality. It is for that reason that we are \r\none of the countries that has done the most to reduce \r\npoverty throughout the world, with a historic reduction \r\nby half of extreme poverty from 17 per cent in 2007 to \r\n8.5 per cent in 2015. Poverty was reduced by one third \r\nfrom 36.7 per cent in 2007 to 23.3 per cent in 2015. \r\nSimilarly, it is a point of pride that Ecuador is one the \r\ncountries that have done the most to reduce inequality, \r\nwhich has been a huge scourge in Latin America. To be \r\nexact, our Gini coefficient fell by six points between \r\n2007 and 2013. That also shows how we respect human \r\nrights.\r\nEcuador continues to push for peace. We do not have \r\nweapons of mass destruction. We are not at war with \r\nany country and we are not bombing anyone. Let us see \r\nto the immediate entry into force of the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nIt is also important that we leave behind the vision \r\nthat sees the State as the sole violator of human rights. Of \r\ncourse, States can violate human rights, but other actors \r\ncan do so, too, especially transnational corporations. \r\nEcuador has experience with such violations. The oil \r\ncompany Chevron Texaco contaminated our rivers and \r\nforests in our region of Amazonía, causing disease and \r\ndeath for our people and doing great damage to the \r\nAmazon jungle. The Chevron Texaco oil spill was 85 \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n24/33 16-29679\r\ntimes bigger than the British Petroleum spill in the Gulf \r\nof Mexico in 2010 and 18 times bigger than the Exxon \r\nValdez spill in Alaska in 1989. The difference is that \r\nthe spill in Ecuador was not accidental, but rather a bid \r\nto make oil at a cheaper cost.\r\nEcuador is not the only country to have suffered \r\nsuch abuse. Transnational corporations cannot continue \r\nto operate without sufficient checks and balances in \r\norder to limit, regulate and supervise their activity \r\nwith a view to the general interest of most of the people \r\nthat inhabit the planet. We reiterate our plea for the \r\nadoption of a legally binding international instrument \r\non transnational corporations and human rights. \r\nWe are grateful for the trust in Ecuador expressed \r\nby States by appointing us to chair the open-ended \r\nintergovernmental working group to draft such a treaty.\r\nAt the twenty-first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, which took place in Paris, my country \r\nproposed the creation of an international environmental \r\njustice court to punish violations of the rights of nature \r\nand establish obligations in terms of ecological debt \r\nand consumption of environmental goods. We live in a \r\nworld where there are courts to punish countries when \r\nthey allegedly endanger or imperil the investments \r\nof major transnational corporations but there are no \r\ncourts to punish those that unscrupulously degrade our \r\nenvironment. That paradox is so decisive and telling of \r\nthe world in which we live, where supremacy belongs \r\nto capital over human beings. We claim the supremacy \r\nof human beings over capital.\r\nIt is imperative that, after decades of discussion, we \r\naccelerate the democratization of the United Nations. \r\nIn particular, we must strike a new balance between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council with \r\na view to increasing votes and decreasing vetoes. In \r\nthat regard, it is urgent that we change the Council’s \r\ncomposition, working methods and competencies, and \r\nlimit its prerogatives. The use of the veto, exclusive \r\nprivilege of the victors of the Second World War, which \r\naccount for 70 per cent of the global arms trade, no \r\nlonger ensures the ultimate objective of maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. We must set a deadline \r\nto conclude negotiations on United Nations reform.\r\nSimilarly, we must reverse the diminution of the \r\nrole multilateralism plays in global governance. We \r\nmust reflect on how to address the emerging para-\r\ninstitutionality, where a club of exclusive and restricted \r\nnumber of countries have the clout to make the decisions \r\nthat affect countries around the world. From the Group \r\nof 77, which Ecuador will have the honour of presiding \r\nover next year, let us demand more democracy and \r\nmore equality among States. Let us leave behind the \r\nglobal order that preceded the great decolonization \r\nof the second half of the twentieth century, and let us \r\ndo away with the model of first-, second- and third-\r\nclass countries.\r\nOur liberator, Simón Bolívar, who said that the \r\nunity of our peoples is not a mere illusion of men, but \r\nan inexorable decree of destiny, would be proud to \r\nsee us make bold strides in uniting the peoples of the \r\nSouth, and would celebrate Ecuador’s active role in the \r\nfight to emancipate our peoples. We have made great \r\nprogress in recent years in consolidating the progress \r\nand sovereignty of our nation within the global system, \r\nbut there is still much left to be done. Regrettably, our \r\nAmerica continues to be the victim of antiquated foreign \r\ninterventionism and domestic reactionary attacks that \r\nseek to prevent the democratization of our societies. We \r\nstill have a long way to go before our elites learn to \r\nrecognize and respect universal suffrage and the votes \r\nof millions of people, in good times and in bad, whether \r\nor not it is in their interest. Let us stop playing games \r\nwith democracy and the sacred mandate of our peoples!\r\nI would be remiss if I did not acknowledge our \r\npeople and the leadership of President Correa, a man \r\nwho has done so much in the interest of full development, \r\njustice and equality. Ten years after the beginning of \r\nthe Citizens’ Revolution, we have replaced despair with \r\nhope, and we have shown humankind that political \r\naction can build a world where human beings are not \r\nmerely instruments for accumulating wealth but rather \r\nthe very purpose of Government.\r\nWe in Quito eagerly await one and all for the \r\nupcoming United Nations Conference on Housing \r\nand Sustainable Urban Development, to be held from \r\n17 to 20 October 2016, where it will be our honour \r\nto host all of our guests in optimistic, hospitable and \r\nrevolutionary Ecuador.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Elmar Maharram oglu Mammadyarov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan.\r\nMr. Mammadyarov (Azerbaijan): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session and to wish him every \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 25/33\r\nsuccess in discharging his important duties. We are also \r\ngrateful to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for all his hard work \r\nin presiding over the Assembly at its seventieth session.\r\nA year ago we gathered here to witness the adoption \r\nof a comprehensive and people-centred post-2015 \r\ndevelopment agenda. There are milestones in history \r\nwhen universal values are translated into political \r\ncommitments that change the course of events. We hope \r\nthat the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment will be one such milestone. When we \r\nreached an agreement on Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs), we drew on the success story of the \r\nMillennium Development Goals, which proved to be \r\ninstrumental in promoting development worldwide.\r\nAzerbaijan has integrated SDG targets into \r\nits national development strategy and continues to \r\nimplement large-scale programmes on improving \r\ngood governance, fostering sustainable growth, \r\nstrengthening the rule of law, ensuring respect for \r\nhuman rights, facilitating access to public services \r\nand promoting inclusive societies. Despite the global \r\neconomic crisis and the sharp decline in oil prices, \r\nAzerbaijan has managed to maintain its economic \r\ngrowth. Sustainable economic growth has enabled \r\nAzerbaijan not only to focus on its national development \r\nstrategy, but also to actively support international \r\ndevelopment. Azerbaijan has rendered international \r\nhumanitarian and development assistance to a number \r\nof countries through the Heydar Aliyev Foundation \r\nand the Azerbaijan International Development Agency \r\nunder the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.\r\nIn June, Azerbaijan was elected to join the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for the years 2017 \r\nto 2019, after a vote at the General Assembly in \r\nwhich 176 of 184 Member States took part. Since the \r\nEconomic and Social Council is the central platform for \r\nprofessional deliberations on sustainable development, \r\nwe will have yet another opportunity to contribute to \r\ninternational development.\r\nTo advance SDG 16, Azerbaijan drew up a draft \r\nresolution entitled “Prevention of corruption by \r\npromoting transparent, accountable and efficient public \r\nservice delivery through the application of best practices \r\nand technological innovations”, which was unanimously \r\nadopted at the sixth session of the Conference of the \r\nStates Parties to the United Nations Convention against \r\nCorruption, held from 2 to 6 November 2015.\r\nAgainst the background of the various threats and \r\nchallenges facing the world nowadays, it is critical to \r\nconsistently promote the value of different cultures, \r\nenhancing understanding among diverse communities \r\nand fostering mutual respect. Located between the two \r\ngreat continents of Asia and Europe, Azerbaijan is a \r\nunique place, where East and West meet, where the \r\nworld’s main religions peacefully coexist and where the \r\nvalues and traditions of different cultures harmoniously \r\ncomplement each other. It is no coincidence that the \r\nseventh Global Forum of the United Nations Alliance \r\nof Civilizations was held this year in my country.\r\nUnresolved armed conflicts, terrorism, violent \r\nextremism, aggressive separatism, intolerance and \r\ndiscrimination on ethnic and religious grounds continue \r\nto represent the most serious challenges to development \r\nand are some of its most persistent obstacles. The \r\noutcome document of the United Nations summit at \r\nwhich the post-2015 development agenda was adopted \r\nstates that there can be no sustainable development \r\nwithout peace and no peace without sustainable \r\ndevelopment, recalling the rights and obligations of \r\nStates under international law and reaffirming the \r\nneed to respect the territorial integrity and political \r\nindependence of States.\r\nSince the last general debate, no substantive \r\nprogress has been made in the settlement of the Armenia-\r\nAzerbaijan conflict. Armenia continues to occupy \r\nAzerbaijani territory, including the Nagorno Karabakh \r\nregion and seven adjacent districts, in f lagrant violation \r\nof international law and Security Council resolutions \r\n853 (1993), 874 (1993) and 884 (1993). It is unfortunate \r\nthat its engagement in the conflict-settlement process is \r\nnothing but a travesty.\r\nAzerbaijan does not have access to the economic \r\npotential of the occupied territory. The disruption \r\nof communications — as a direct consequence \r\nof the military occupation of our territory — is a \r\nserious obstacle to the full-f ledged socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment of the country as a whole. Further, the \r\nregion’s untapped prospects for economic development \r\nare going unfulfilled, particularly in terms of intra- and \r\ntransregional connectivity.\r\nThe humanitarian consequences of the conflict \r\nhave been equally grim, which makes urgent \r\nsolutions necessary. As a direct impact of the massive \r\ndisplacement of people from their places of origin, close \r\nto 1 million refugees and internally displaced persons \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n26/33 16-29679\r\ncontinue to be deprived of their basic human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, most notably the right to have \r\naccess to their homes and property. Further continuation \r\nof this situation is intolerable.\r\nArmenia’s policy and practices in the occupied \r\nterritory of Azerbaijan undermine the prospects of \r\nachieving a political settlement of the conflict and pose \r\nan imminent threat to the peace, security and stability \r\nof the region. The Republic of Azerbaijan has made it \r\nclear on numerous occasions that the unlawful presence \r\nof Armenia’s armed forces in the occupied Azerbaijani \r\nterritory is a major factor in destabilizing the region. \r\nIt has the potential of escalating at any time, with \r\nunpredictable consequences. It is also the main cause \r\nof tensions and incidents in the conflict zone.\r\nInstead of engaging in negotiations in good faith, \r\nArmenia demonstrably disrupts any attempt to settle \r\nthe conflict by peaceful means. In total disregard of \r\nSecurity Council demands and in f lagrant violation \r\nof international law, Armenia refuses to withdraw \r\nits troops from Azerbaijan, prevents hundreds of \r\nthousands of forcibly displaced Azerbaijanis from \r\nreturning to their homes and tries to further consolidate \r\nthe status quo by altering the physical, demographic \r\nand cultural character of the occupied territories — a \r\nworrying development that was confirmed by a number \r\nof fact-finding missions conducted by the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE). \r\nFurthermore, Armenia frequently resorts to armed \r\nprovocations in an attempt to divert attention from the \r\ncore, substantive issues of the peace process, trying, \r\ninstead, to put focus on the technical aspects of the \r\nceasefire.\r\nRecently, in early April 2016, Armenia conducted \r\nlarge-scale attacks against the civilian population of \r\nAzerbaijan. It subjected densely populated areas of \r\nAzerbaijan, including schools, hospitals and places \r\nof worship, to intensive fire from heavy artillery and \r\nlarge-calibre weapons. As a result of these reckless \r\nattacks, large numbers of Azerbaijani civilians, \r\nincluding children, women and the elderly, were killed \r\nor seriously wounded. Had effective civil defence \r\nmeasures not been used in a timely manner, the \r\nnumber of casualties would have been significantly \r\nhigher. Armenia also systematically mutilated the \r\nbodies of fallen Azerbaijani soldiers. During those \r\nattacks, 34 towns and villages in Azerbaijan suffered \r\nsevere destruction. Substantial damage was inflicted \r\nupon private and public property, including critical \r\ncivilian infrastructure. In particular, hundreds of \r\ncivilian buildings, among them residences, schools, \r\nkindergartens, cultural centres and other civilian \r\nfacilities, were ruined.\r\nArmenia’s direct and deliberate attacks against the \r\nAzerbaijani civilian population, as well as inhuman \r\nacts against Azerbaijani military servicemen during its \r\noffensive action in April, constitute yet another serious \r\nviolation of international humanitarian and human \r\nrights law. By its deliberate offensive actions, Armenia \r\nhas undermined the ceasefire regime established in \r\n1994 and endangered the prospects for the political \r\nsettlement of the conflict.\r\nHaving received an effective response from \r\nAzerbaijan, Armenia was forced to request a ceasefire, \r\nwhich was agreed pursuant to the mediation efforts \r\nof the Russian Federation on 5 April, in Moscow, at \r\nthe meeting of the chiefs of defence of Armenia and \r\nAzerbaijan. Despite that agreement, Armenia continued \r\nto violate the ceasefire. After amassing forces in seized \r\nAzerbaijani territory and building heavily reinforced \r\nmilitary fortifications, on 19 September, Armenia \r\nbegan intensive military activity in the occupied \r\nAghdam district. Meanwhile, Armenia has continued \r\nto challenge and attempt to undermine the efforts of \r\nthe international community, including those of the \r\nco-Chair countries of the OSCE Minsk Group, namely, \r\nthe United States, Russia and France, which have been \r\naimed at achieving a breakthrough in the peace talks \r\nand withdrawing Armenia’s troops from the sovereign \r\nlands of Azerbaijan.\r\nArmenia must realize that exploiting the status \r\nquo and armed provocations is a grave miscalculation. \r\nIts hypocritical attempts to mislead the international \r\ncommunity on the root causes of the conflict by \r\nrepresenting themselves as the suffering party is \r\ndoomed to fail. Azerbaijan expects Armenia to halt its \r\nmilitary build-up in the occupied territory and engage \r\nin negotiations with Azerbaijan in good faith, so as to \r\nfind a long-overdue political solution to the conflict. \r\nThe conflict can be resolved only on the basis of \r\nAzerbaijan’s sovereignty and territorial integrity within \r\nits internationally recognized borders, as reflected, \r\nincidentally, in the resolutions of the Security Council. \r\nThe sooner Armenia reconciles itself to this reality and \r\nwithdraws its armed forces from the occupied territory \r\nof Azerbaijan, the earlier the conflict will be resolved. \r\nArmenia and its population will then benefit from the \r\nprospects of cooperation and economic development. \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 27/33\r\nMy country will spare no effort to achieve the \r\nsettlement of the conflict and ensuring peace, justice \r\nand development in the region.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Raymond Tshibanda N’tungamulongo, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nMr. Tshibanda N’tungamulongo (Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo) (spoke in French): I take the \r\nf loor on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Joseph Kabila \r\nKabange, President of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, whom I am honoured to represent. It is a true \r\npleasure to join previous speakers in congratulating \r\nthe President on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session and to \r\nwish him and his Bureau full success in the execution of \r\ntheir mandate. I also address this well-deserved tribute \r\nto his predecessor, in the light of his tireless efforts that \r\nhave so greatly served our Organization.\r\nMotivated by the desire to achieve peace, security \r\nand development in every one of our States and \r\nthroughout the world, in September of last year together \r\nwe adopted a new global development agenda, which \r\nwe intend to inspire us for the next 15 years. It was \r\nmeant to overcome the challenges of underdevelopment \r\nand poverty and create a more just world with greater \r\nsolidarity and stability, where equal opportunity would \r\nno longer be only a dream.\r\nThe theme for this general debate, “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”, is an inarguable opportunity. It allows for a \r\nfirst overall assessment of the focus of the new agenda \r\nso that, if necessary, we can adjust the path forward \r\nin order to guarantee the full achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Taking into \r\nconsideration lessons learned from the efforts to achieve \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo chose to integrate the SDGs into \r\nour national strategic development plan. It is based on \r\na long-term view and a strategic framework to ensure \r\nthat our policies and actions align with the issues of \r\nclimate change as well as the priorities of the African \r\nUnion’s Agenda 2063, which has committed us to a \r\nprocess aimed at raising the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo into the middle-income-country category by \r\n2021, the emerging-country category by 2030 and the \r\ndeveloped-country category by 2050.\r\nThe implementation of this plan will take the \r\nform of five-year plans, the first of which covers \r\nthe period from 2017 to 2021. In this first five-year \r\nplan, priority will again be given to the improvement \r\nof human capital, by taking on the problem of the \r\ndemographic dividends that require strict collaboration \r\namong various stakeholders in development at both \r\nthe national and international levels, with a view to \r\nensuring strong, sustained and, above all, inclusive, \r\neconomic growth. Particular attention is therefore \r\npaid to the specific needs of youths and women in \r\nterms of education, job training, improvement of \r\ntheir scientific and technological knowledge, health \r\nand employment. Actions stemming from this option \r\nare designed to jointly implement a programme for \r\nbuilding the transportation infrastructure needed to \r\nbring agricultural and mining products to market and \r\nstimulate the mobility of persons and goods.\r\nBeyond that, there are many challenges, including \r\nthat of strengthening the national statistical system \r\nand the population and housing census, with a \r\nview to having reliable updated data for designing, \r\nmonitoring and evaluating development programmes. \r\nIn the case of my country, these efforts are naturally \r\nlinked to the mobilization of funds, in particular by \r\neasing the conditions for donors and diversifying \r\nfinancial resources.\r\nWith regard to the political situation, my country \r\nhas entered into a crucial phase of administrative \r\ndecentralization in order to enable local management. \r\nEach of the 26 new provinces of my country currently \r\nhave authorities that the population has freely chosen, \r\nfollowing the elections for provincial governors and \r\ndeputy governors of the province, which took place in \r\nMarch and April. This new democratic experience will \r\ncontinue when future elections are organized for local \r\nauthorities in both urban and rural areas, to take place \r\nconcurrently with the presidential, legislative, national \r\nand provincial elections. The Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo has made an irreversible choice in ensuring \r\nthat access to State power is possible only through \r\nthe elections.\r\nI would also like to most solemnly reaffirm that, \r\ndespite delays in registration and preparations, the \r\ngeneral elections initially slated for the end of this year \r\nwill be organized by the Independent National Electoral \r\nCommission, which has, under the Constitution, \r\nexclusive jurisdiction over them. The elections will take \r\nplace as planned, that is, as soon as technical conditions \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n28/33 16-29679\r\npermit. Many other challenges need to be overcome in \r\norder to allow the organization of free, transparent, \r\ncredible and peaceful elections. In order to come together \r\nand meet these challenges in a consensual manner, the \r\npresidential majority, the political opposition and civil \r\nsociety came together over a two-week period in order \r\nto engage in an inclusive national political dialogue \r\nfacilitated by the African Union with the assistance of \r\nan international support group.\r\nThe right to elect and be elected is a fundamental \r\nright both for Congolese citizens who live in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and for those who \r\nlive abroad. The major challenge today in exercising \r\nthat right is to ensure that we have inclusive and reliable \r\nvoting registers. In that regard, I would like to welcome \r\nthe importance of the voter registration process that \r\nbegan on 31 July, which gives the possibility for people \r\nto run for office and to vote. It has included more than \r\n14 million Congolese, those who live in the country or \r\nabroad, representing one third of the electoral core, who \r\ncould not have enjoyed this right without those reforms.\r\nThe current political national dialogue in the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo and the process of \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes among Congolese with a \r\nview to organizing the elections and consolidating our \r\ndemocracy should benefit from everyone’s support, in \r\nparticular of political actors who are not yet participating \r\nin the process, but who are encouraged to do so. On \r\nthe other hand, any recourse to the use of violence \r\nshould be strongly condemned and the perpetrators \r\npunished, and any invitation to any insurrection or \r\nother unconstitutional mode of access to power should \r\nbe denounced.\r\nThe promotion of human rights has made progress \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a post-\r\nconflict State that has had to face numerous challenges. \r\nTwo months ago, we hosted a visit from the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees in the \r\ncontext of cooperation with his Office and the Human \r\nRights Council. We are planning to pursue and deepen \r\nreforms in this area. That has certainly been the case \r\nwith respect to the protection of women’s rights. Two \r\nimportant laws have been recently enacted — one on \r\ngender equality and one on changing the outdated \r\nprovisions of the family code, in order to align the law \r\nwith international law in force. With regard to violence \r\nagainst women, we have seen reliable indicators that \r\nhave shown a net reduction of 50 per cent in cases of \r\nsexual violence from 2014 to 2015.\r\nWith specific regard to the right to health care, \r\nsignificant progress has been achieved in fighting \r\nHIV/AIDS and malaria. However, we need to remain \r\nvigilant with regard to certain cross-border diseases \r\nthat had been eradicated in the past, namely, yellow \r\nfever and cholera, of which we have recently seen some \r\nsigns of resurgence.\r\nThe mandate of the United Nations Organization \r\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo (MONUSCO) was extended to 31 March \r\n2017, pursuant to resolution 2277 (2016), in order to \r\nsupport the laudable efforts that the Forces armées \r\nde la République démocratique du Congo have been \r\ndeploying to root out the armed groups that are still \r\nresistant to peace. While welcoming the assistance, \r\nthe Government of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo notes that thanks to the security sector reform \r\ncurrently under way, the national defence and security \r\nforces have shown greater efficiency and competence \r\nin the execution of their mission to protect the national \r\nterritory and provide security for goods and persons. \r\nThey are therefore relying on the strategic dialogue \r\nwith the United Nations to achieve a progressive \r\nreduction of MONUSCO personnel and a subsequent \r\ntransformation of the Mission.\r\nHaving informed the Assembly about the situation \r\nin my country, I would now like to express the vision of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo on several major \r\nissues of concern in the world today.\r\nThroughout its existence, the United Nations has \r\nmade numerous important achievements and attained \r\nsuccess in the areas of peace, security, international \r\ncooperation, human rights and socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. In spite of these results, international \r\npeace remains an ongoing quest. In addition, as it \r\noperates in a world that is constantly changing and \r\nevolving, the United Nations is called upon to exercise \r\nits specific mandate to constantly question itself and \r\nadapt in order to better confront the new challenges and \r\nthreats that the world is facing.\r\nThat is why reform of our international Organization \r\nand its methods and modes of operation is necessary. \r\nIn that regard, we need to look into broadening the \r\nmembership of the permanent and non-permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council. The Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo attaches importance to that \r\nreform, which, in order to be viable, must take the \r\npolitical and numerical weight of Africa in the General \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 29/33\r\nAssembly into account and allow that continent to fully \r\ntake part in decisions that concern it, especially since two \r\nthirds of the situations reviewed in the Security Council \r\nconcern Africa. To that end, the Ezulwini Consensus \r\nremains the only acceptable basis for negotiation. In \r\nthe same context, it is important to also strengthen the \r\ndecision-making power of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Economic and Social Council to promote peace, \r\nsocial justice, democracy and development.\r\nThe international commercial and financial \r\narchitecture must also undergo profound transformations \r\nso that it can adapt to developments and changes on the \r\ninternational scene and so that the United Nations can \r\nbe a source of hope for all. Moreover, our Organization \r\nshould promote greater transparency and democracy, \r\nparticularly in selecting the next Secretary-General, \r\nwhile preserving the rules and practices that have \r\nproved to be effective, in particular the regional \r\nrotation scheme.\r\nThe fight for peace is also a fight against terrorism. \r\nThat scourge of our century must remain one of \r\nthe priorities of our Organization. For my country, \r\nterrorism is now the most serious threat to international \r\npeace and security. The despicable and indiscriminate \r\nacts that characterize that phenomenon demand \r\ninternational solidarity and continuous dialogue in \r\norder to better organize our response. The peoples \r\nliving in the eastern part of my country, particularly \r\nin the region of Beni, have on more than one occasion \r\nbecome the innocent victims of terrorist violence. That \r\nis why we reiterate here our support for the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, as well as \r\nour firm condemnation of the scourge of terrorism in \r\nall its forms and manifestations.\r\nOur planet is confronting an unprecedented \r\nenvironmental challenge in the form of climate change, \r\nwhich has a direct negative impact on the quality of our \r\nlives and which mortgages the very future of humankind. \r\nThat is why, after having actively participated in the \r\nnegotiations and the conclusion of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo, through the intervention of its Head of State, \r\nsigned the Agreement on 22 April here in New York. \r\nNow we are finalizing the ratification process, which \r\nshould be completed before the end of this year.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of the Congo welcomes \r\nanother major advancement with regard to international \r\ngovernance, that is, the adoption of the final document \r\nof the recent high-level meeting on addressing large \r\nmovements of refugees and migrants, namely, the \r\nNew York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants \r\n(resolution 71/1, annex). It is high time to put an end to \r\nthe thousands of migrant deaths in the Mediterranean \r\nand address the root causes of those displacements, \r\nwhich are mainly poverty, armed conflicts and the lack \r\nof resilience to disasters. We must make sure that we \r\nresolve those problems so that all citizens of the world, \r\nand in particular those in developing countries, can live \r\nhappily and peacefully in their own countries. That is the \r\nvery basic principle of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, that is, to leave no one behind.\r\nI have focused my comments today on the launch \r\nby the Government of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo of the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals from the beginning of 2016 by \r\ndetermining priority actions, while noting the links \r\nbetween its goals and my country’s new strategic \r\ndevelopment plan. I have also given a general overview \r\nof the political, electoral and human rights situation in \r\nmy country, while mentioning the partnership between \r\nmy Government and the United Nations Organization \r\nStabilization Mission in the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo.\r\nIn so doing, I called for United Nations reform \r\nthrough the enlargement of the Security Council and the \r\nstrengthening of the mandate of the General Assembly. \r\nI stressed that there is a need for international solidarity \r\nand ongoing consultations in order to better organize our \r\ncommon response to the fight against terrorism. I also \r\nrecalled the huge importance of the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change and welcomed the adoption of the New \r\nYork Declaration, which provides us with the strategy \r\nfor managing the large-scale displacements of refugees \r\nand migrants, by noting the need to tackle the root \r\ncauses of those evils.\r\nI will conclude my remarks by once again reiterating \r\nour faith in multilateralism and expressing the hope \r\nto see everyone uphold and promote its principles \r\nand values  in the interest of international peace and \r\nfor the good of humankind. I would like to salute and \r\npay tribute to Mr. Ban Ki-moon, whose mandate as \r\nSecretary-General of our Organization is coming to \r\nan end. We would like to thank him for his significant \r\ncontributions to the preservation of the principles \r\nand values of our Organization and for his decisive \r\ncontribution to re-establishing peace and stability in \r\nmy country.\r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n30/33 16-29679\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate for this meeting.\r\nThe exercise of the right of reply has been requested \r\nby several delegations. May I remind members that \r\nstatements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Sornarajah (United Kingdom): The United \r\nKingdom wishes to exercise its right of reply in the light \r\nof comments made in the statement of His Excellency \r\nSir Anerood Jugnauth, Prime Minister of Mauritius, \r\nin the debate this morning. The British Government \r\nhas no doubts about its sovereignty over the Chagos \r\nArchipelago, which it administers as the British Indian \r\nOcean Territory. No international tribunal, including \r\nthe recent arbitral tribunal constituted under Annex 7 \r\nto the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, \r\nhas ever called the United Kingdom’s sovereignty of the \r\nterritory into doubt. While the United Kingdom does \r\nnot recognize the claim of the Republic of Mauritius \r\nto the sovereignty of the Chagos Archipelago, it has \r\nrepeatedly undertaken to cede the Archipelago to \r\nMauritius, once it no longer requires those islands \r\nfor defence purposes. We maintain that commitment, \r\nalthough it is for the United Kingdom alone to determine \r\nwhen that condition is met.\r\nIn the meantime, the defence purposes referred \r\nto contribute significantly towards global security \r\nand are central to efforts to counter regional threats, \r\nincluding those stemming from terrorism and piracy. \r\nWe do not consider that the International Court of \r\nJustice is the appropriate way to resolve this matter. We \r\nhave therefore asked the Government of Mauritius not \r\nto continue with that course of action and to resolve \r\nthose issues through the bilateral discussions that have \r\nbeen ongoing. We will continue to engage bilaterally \r\nwith Mauritius.\r\nMr. Pavlichenko (Ukraine): I am taking the f loor \r\nin order to exercise the right of reply following the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Russian \r\nFederation earlier today. Because of the late hour, I will \r\nconfine myself merely to the following fundamental \r\npoints.\r\nThe situation in Ukraine referred to by the Russian \r\ndelegation was caused by Russian imperial ambitions, \r\nparticularly by the Russian aggression against my \r\ncountry, which started with the illegal occupation of the \r\nAutonomous Republic of Crimea, and subsequently by \r\nRussia fuelling the conflict in certain parts of Ukraine, \r\nthe Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Were it not for the \r\nconstant and sustained f low of weapons, fighters and \r\nregular Russian troops into Ukrainian territory, 10,000 \r\nof my compatriots would not have been killed and \r\n20,000 injured. The lives and well-being of millions \r\nof Ukrainian citizens would not have been adversely \r\naffected. In that regard, we have urged Russia time and \r\nagain to restore respect for the norms of international \r\nlaw and the Charter of the United Nations, to hold back \r\nits aggression against Ukraine and to end the illegal \r\noccupation of the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and \r\nthe city of Sevastopol.\r\nIn conclusion, in as much as the Russian Minister \r\nmentioned George Orwell’s novel Animal Farm in \r\nhis statement, I would like to mention another one of \r\nOrwell’s novels, Nineteen Eighty-four, in particular the \r\nfamous quote, “War is peace, freedom is slavery and \r\nignorance is strength.” That is the exact philosophy that \r\nRussia wants to impose on its own people and on the \r\nrest of the world.\r\nMr. Giacomelli da Silva (Brazil) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): With respect to the statements made by the \r\nrepresentatives of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines and \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, we reiterate the \r\nwords of our President, Michel Temer, on 20 September \r\nhere in this Hall:\r\n“Governments of different political inclinations \r\ncoexist in our region. That is natural and sound. \r\nWhat is essential is that there be mutual respect and \r\nthat we agree on basic common objectives, such as \r\neconomic growth, human rights, social progress, \r\nsecurity and freedom for all citizens.” (A/71/PV.8).\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): I am forced to exercise \r\nthe right of reply in response to the statement made \r\nby the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Azerbaijan, \r\nbecause, in listening to the falsifications presented by \r\nthe Minister, I could not figure out whether it is due to \r\nthe fact that the lies have been repeated so many times \r\nthat the Azerbaijanis themselves have started to believe \r\nthose lies.\r\nMemories are so short that the Azerbaijanis have \r\ntotally forgotten the fact that Nagorno Karabakh \r\nnever was part of Azerbaijan. It was transferred to \r\nAzerbaijan in 1921 by the decision of the Bolshevik \r\nparty. The Republic of Azerbaijan of 1918-1920 did not \r\ninclude Nagorno Karabakh. Now that there is no longer \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 31/33\r\nany Soviet Union any longer, Nagorno Karabakh is \r\nindependent. Nagorno Karabakh was never, is not, and \r\nwill never be part of Azerbaijan.\r\nAzerbaijan cannot and will never have access to the \r\neconomic potential of the independent State of Nagorno \r\nKarabakh. Paraphrasing the words of the Minister, \r\nthe sooner Azerbaijan reconciles with that reality and \r\nstops killing peaceful civilians, the earlier the Nagorno \r\nKarabakh issue will be resolved. Moreover, in order to \r\nreconcile oneself to the fact that the war that Azerbaijan \r\nunleashed against the people of Nagorno Karabakh was \r\nlost a long time ago, one has to get over it. If one starts \r\na war and one loses the war, one cannot continue to \r\nblame someone else.\r\nAzerbaijan cannot, it seems, stop portraying \r\neverything as being topsy-turvy. The abhorrent \r\nbarbarism committed against Nagorno Karabakh \r\nby the armed forces of Azerbaijan in early April, \r\nincluding intentional, indiscriminate targeting of \r\npeaceful civilians, especially children, women and \r\nthe elderly, and civilian facilities, including schools \r\nand kindergartens, killings, barbaric beheadings, \r\ntorture and the mutilation of bodies is incompatible \r\nwith the elementary norms of a civilized world. When \r\nbeheadings and other barbaric acts are broadcast on \r\ncivilian media sources and the President of the country \r\nencourages the soldiers who have committed those \r\nbarbaric acts, such actions must not be tolerated.\r\nThe situation is a direct result of a longstanding \r\npolicy of racism, intolerance and the incitement of \r\nhatred against Armenians, condoned and directly \r\nexecuted by the authorities of Azerbaijan. The grave \r\nand systematic violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw committed by Azerbaijan and the glorification at \r\nthe highest political level of persons directly involved \r\nin the atrocities and mutilations constitute crimes \r\nagainst humanity and war crimes.\r\nIf Azerbaijan wishes to contest what I am saying, \r\nit should agree to the proposal of the Organization \r\nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) \r\nMinsk Group co-Chairs regarding the mechanism for \r\ninvestigating ceasefire violations. The Republic of \r\nArmenia and the Nagorno Karabakh Republic have \r\nprovided their agreement. Azerbaijan has refused. \r\nPlease tell me who has something to hide.\r\nAzerbaijan keeps on discussing Azerbaijani \r\nrefugees. What about the Armenian, Russian, Jewish, \r\nGreek, Assyrian, Kurdish and Yazidi people who became \r\nrefugees as a result of the Azerbaijani aggression? Only \r\nthose who were massacred in Sumgait, Baku, Ganja and \r\nother towns and villages in Azerbaijan did not become \r\nrefugees. But massacres are not a solution. Believe me. \r\nThe people were slaughtered by their own neighbours. \r\nThe sooner Azerbaijan reconciles itself to the \r\nfact that Nagorno Karabakh is independent and will \r\nnever be part of Azerbaijan, the better. The right of \r\nthe people of Nagorno Karabakh to self-determination \r\nhas been expressed earlier. Refugees want to return \r\nto their original hometowns and residences, including \r\nthe Armenian refugees who would like to return to \r\nCharentsavan, Artashat and other Armenian regions \r\nthat have been annexed by Azerbaijan as a result of its \r\naggression.\r\nMr. Mammadov (Azerbaijan): We are taking the \r\nf loor to counter the baseless allegations made by the \r\nArmenian representative. As all who are present know, \r\nthe Republic of Armenia unleashed war and used and \r\ncontinues to use force against the territorial integrity of \r\nAzerbaijan, occupying almost one fifth of our territory, \r\nincluding the Nagorno Karabakh region and seven \r\nadjacent districts. \r\nArmenia also carried out large-scale ethnic \r\ncleaning in the seized areas by expelling about 1 million \r\nAzerbaijanis. The successive Governments of Armenia \r\nhave established a notorious pattern of completely \r\ndisregarding the generally accepted norms and \r\nprinciples of international law. Committing war crimes \r\nand crimes against humanity, sponsoring terrorism, \r\nadhering to dubious ethno-religious ideologies and \r\nraising territorial claims against all of its neighbours \r\nhave become part of the normal conduct of that Member \r\nState. In fact, it has been well established that Armenia \r\nhas grossly violated international law. The armed forces \r\nof Armenia overran the town of Khojaly in February \r\n1992, which is situated in the Nagorno Karabakh region \r\nof Azerbaijan, and subjected the civilian population \r\nand its defenders to an unprecedented massacre.\r\nThe barbarism carried out by Armenia in Khojaly \r\nand elsewhere probably created a prototype for the \r\nnotorious behaviour of the Islamic State in Syria and \r\nthe Levant. With its continued use of force against the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, \r\nArmenia has f lagrantly violated the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. In addition, by expelling Azerbaijan’s \r\ncivilian population and preventing their return to their \r\nA/71/PV.19 23/09/2016\r\n32/33 16-29679\r\nhomes, Armenian is grossly violating basic human \r\nrights and international humanitarian law.\r\nWe would like to refresh the memory of the \r\nArmenian delegation with regard to Security Council \r\nresolution 874 (1993), in which the Council reaffirmed \r\nthat the Nagorno Karabakh region is part of Azerbaijan. \r\nFurthermore, the Security Council demanded the \r\nimmediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of \r\nthe occupying forces from all of the occupied territory \r\nof Azerbaijan. Furthermore, I would like to note that \r\nthe Armenian side frequently speculates about the \r\nBolshevik decision of the early 1920s. In fact, in the \r\nearly 1920s, the Bolshevik Communist party gave \r\nhistoric Azerbaijani lands to Armenia, specifically the \r\nZangezur region. \r\nRegarding the Nagorno Karabakh region, the \r\nBolshevik party made a decision to retain it as a part \r\nof Azerbaijan. In fact, it was the Bolshevik party, \r\nspecifically the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, \r\nJoseph Stalin, who signed a decree in 1948 for the \r\ndeportation of 100 Azerbaijanis from what is now called \r\nArmenia. Furthermore, Armenia has been taking an \r\nunconstructive position in the peace process. Instead of \r\nengaging in negotiations in good faith with Azerbaijan, \r\nit has tried to consolidate the status quo and mislead the \r\ninternational community. That is a significant part of \r\nArmenia’s efforts in that connection.\r\nI would like to remind members that Armenia \r\nvenerates war criminals and convicted terrorists, such \r\nas Monte Melkonian and Varoujan Garabedian, who \r\nare convicted terrorists but are now venerated as war \r\nheroes in Armenia. The Armenians have even erected \r\nmonuments to them. Moreover, the Government of \r\nArmenia openly threatens to conduct further armed \r\nattacks against Azerbaijan’s populated areas and \r\ncritical civilian infrastructure, such as water dams and \r\nother places, which could lead to mass killings. The \r\nArmenian President and other officials have taken pride \r\nin participating in the killing of Azerbaijani civilians, \r\nincluding in Khojaly town. Statements to that effect on \r\nthe part of high-level Armenian officials have become \r\nfrequent in recent times.\r\nI believe that Armenia should stop its futile efforts \r\nto misuse the novel principle of self-determination to \r\ncover up their use of force against Azerbaijan and the \r\nnotorious ethnic cleansing that they had committed \r\nagainst 1 million Azerbaijanis. Armenia is the last \r\nentity in the world with the right to speak about the \r\nprinciple of self-determination. It is a country that has \r\nensured that its territory is completely monoethnic, \r\nas result of its deporting and forcing out all other \r\nethnicities, including large numbers of Azerbaijanis, \r\nwhich constituted up to 50 per cent of the population of \r\nthe territory, including in its capital, Yerevan.\r\nAs for allegations regarding the recent political \r\nprocesses, including the negotiations and the \r\nstrengthening of the ceasefire regime, Azerbaijan stands \r\nfor an effective ceasefire. Our main concern is that \r\nfrequent violence diverts attention from the resolution \r\nof the remaining issues to technical issues. It should \r\nalso be stressed that all such measures can be helpful \r\nonly in the context of results-oriented, substantive talks \r\nthat conform with the agreements reached at the Vienna \r\nand Saint Petersburg meetings.\r\nMr. Kazhoyan (Armenia): I apologize for taking the \r\nf loor once again. When somebody says that something \r\nis an established truth, I most certainly want to hear by \r\nwhom and where it was established and where the proof \r\nlies. Otherwise, nothing is established until it is proven \r\nand established, or capable of being proven. \r\nIn speaking of Khojaly, it is strange to hear the \r\nAzerbaijani delegation speaking about Khojaly. \r\nI mentioned their short memory. If one reads the \r\nAzerbaijani newspapers of that time, it is perfectly \r\nclear who committed the Khojaly genocide — it was the \r\nleadership of Azerbaijan. That information was posted \r\nin newspapers all over the country. I definitely agree \r\nabout the behaviour pattern of the Islamic State in the \r\nLevant and Syria. That pattern could well have been \r\ncreated in Khojaly, but that pattern was created by the \r\nAzerbaijani troops, who were killing their own civilian \r\npopulation. Armenian troops were, on the contrary, \r\nopening free peace corridors to facilitate the civilian \r\npopulation’s withdrawal from the scene of the fighting.\r\nReturning to the issue of self-determination, the \r\ncurrent negotiations are, as was mentioned, being \r\nconducted under the leadership of the Minsk Group \r\nco-Chairs, in accordance with three basic principles, \r\nnamely, the self-determination of nations, territorial \r\nintegrity and the non-use of force or threat of the use of \r\nforce. How can one not talk about self-determination? \r\nSelf-determination is part of the history of the 193 \r\nStates Members of the current United Nations. If any \r\nnation has had the right to self-determination, then \r\nArmenians in Nagorno Karabakh have that same right. \r\n23/09/2016 A/71/PV.19\r\n16-29679 33/33\r\nNo Azerbaijani official can deny them those universal \r\nhuman rights.\r\nIt is also interesting to hear about the 1918-1920 \r\nsituation. What should be remembered, however, is that \r\nthe League of Nations accepted the request of Armenia \r\nand Georgia for admission to the League of Nations. \r\nThe League refused Azerbaijan’s request for admission \r\nto the League because of its territorial problems and \r\nunresolved issues with its neighbours.\r\nSpeaking about glorifying the remembrance of \r\nterrorists, Azerbaijan is the first country to harbour \r\ncriminals and terrorists, while granting them the \r\nstatus of a hero. Everybody remembers the story of the \r\nAzerbaijani officer who murdered a sleeping Armenian \r\nofficer with an axe during NATO exercises in Budapest, \r\nHungary. The Hungarian court sentenced the axe \r\nmurderer to life in prison; but he was later extradited \r\nto Azerbaijan to continue his sentence. The moment his \r\nplane landed in Azerbaijan, the Azerbaijani President \r\npardoned him, granting him every possible glorification \r\nas a hero. He became a national Azerbaijani hero. I \r\ncannot believe that a nation has chosen someone like \r\nRamil Safarov as a hero merely because he killed an \r\nArmenian. What is the future of such a nation?\r\nArmenia is home to 12 national and religious \r\nminorities. Some of them, including Yazidis and \r\nAssyrians, lack their own State. They are very happily \r\nliving in Armenia, where they are guaranteed all of their \r\nrights. Azerbaijani people were also living in Armenia \r\nwith guaranteed rights. However, after the outbreak \r\nof the massacres in Azerbaijan, where every single \r\nArmenian was massacred, today, out of a population of \r\nabout half a million Armenians formerly in Azerbaijan, \r\nnot a single Armenian remains in Azerbaijan; the \r\nAzerbaijani authorities had, however, presented some \r\nfalsified numbers on that topic.\r\nWho is more tolerant and who is not? I will leave \r\nthat rhetorical question to Member States.\r\nMr. Mammadov (Azerbaijan): I would like to \r\nmake just a few remarks. \r\nWe would like to refresh the memory of the \r\nArmenian delegation that, in the current negotiations, \r\nthe principles now under discussion are based on the \r\nHelsinki Final Act. The Helsinki Final Act stresses \r\nthree principles. But somehow the Armenian delegation \r\ntries to provide short versions of them. The first is the \r\npolitical independence of States. Given the years of \r\nwar against the territorial integrity of Azerbaijan, the \r\nArmenian side has violated that principle. That is the \r\nfirst issue.\r\nThe second principle is the respect for the \r\nterritorial integrity of States. We are wondering how the \r\nArmenian side sees that, namely, their obligation under \r\ninternational law to respect the territorial integrity of \r\nStates.\r\nThe third principle is the equal rights and self-\r\ndetermination of peoples, in conformity with the \r\nterritorial integrity of States, as written in the Helsinki \r\nFinal Act. Azerbaijan highly appreciates the principle \r\nof self-determination. The issue is that Armenia has no \r\nright at all to speculate on that principle. For example, \r\nfirst, they have covered up the use of force against \r\nAzerbaijan and the ethnic cleansing; secondly, they \r\nseek to divert attention from the notorious monoethnic \r\nsituation that Armenia has artificially created in its \r\nown territory. As for the case of Khojaly, indeed, it is \r\none of the darkest pages in the history of mankind. \r\nWith regard to responsibility, let me remind \r\neveryone that President Serzh Sargsyan, the current \r\nPresident of Armenia, who was head of the illegal \r\narmed formations that were created by Armenia in the \r\noccupied Azerbaijan territories and which occupied \r\nthe town of Khojaly in 1992, admitted in public, on \r\nrecord, without any feeling of remorse, unequivocally, \r\nhis culpability for the extermination of the inhabitants \r\nand defenders of the town. The following citation from \r\na well-known interview with the Armenian President is \r\nself-explanatory:\r\n“Before Khojaly, the people of Azerbaijan \r\nthought that the Armenians were people who could \r\nnot raise their hands against the civilian population. \r\nWe were able to break that stereotype.”\r\nThat comes from an interview with Thomas De Waal \r\nfrom his book Black Garden: Armenia and Azerbaijan \r\nThrough Peace and War, published by New York \r\nUniversity Press in 2003. I think the quote clearly \r\nshows the responsibility of the Armenian Government. \r\nWith regard to Azerbaijan, the Government has \r\nnot given any awards to anyone who was convicted on \r\ncharges of terrorism. It was the Government of Armenia \r\nthat pardoned Monte Melkonian, who was a convicted \r\nterrorist. The Prime Minister of Armenia welcomed \r\nanother convicted terrorist, Varoujan Garabedian, at \r\nthe airport. No official of Azerbaijan has ever done \r\nanything similar.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.30 p.m.\r\n"
