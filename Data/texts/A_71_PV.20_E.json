"United Nations A/71/PV.20\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n20th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 24 September 2016, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.00 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nAddress by Mr. Rui Maria de Araújo, Prime \r\nMinister of the Democratic Republic of Timor-\r\nLeste\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Prime Minister of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste.\r\nMr. Rui Maria de Araújo, Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Rui Maria de Araújo, Prime \r\nMinister of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Araújo (Timor-Leste) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I would like \r\nto begin by congratulating you, Sir, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session, and by wishing you the greatest success in \r\ndischarging your new duties. It is with great satisfaction \r\nthat Timor-Leste, a half-island nation in the Pacific, \r\nwelcomes a representative from another Pacific island \r\nto preside over the General Assembly. I am certain that \r\nyou, Sir, are well aware of the challenges that we face \r\nwith regard to climate change and the management \r\nof our seas and marine resources. I would also like to \r\ncongratulate the outgoing President, His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, for all of his work and his \r\nunparalleled efforts to revitalize the General Assembly \r\nby increasing its effectiveness and efficiency and by \r\nstrengthening its role as it carries out the duties set \r\nforth in the Charter of the United Nations, as well as his \r\ncommitment to a transparent selection process of the \r\nnext Secretary-General.\r\nIn the light of the fact that this is his last general \r\ndebate, I would also like to express, on behalf of Timor-\r\nLeste, our deepest appreciation to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for the support Timor-Leste has received \r\nduring his 10 years in office. His legacy has established \r\nthe foundations for a reform of the bureaucracy and \r\npeacekeeping operations, and he has driven efforts to \r\nplace human rights, climate change and refugees and \r\nmigrants at the forefront of the Organization’s agenda. \r\nAs a symbol of the ideals of the United Nations, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon has worked to make the world safer for women \r\nand young people, promoted sustainable development \r\nactively and fortified the role of prevention.\r\nBased on our accumulated experience and the \r\nrecommendations included in reports on peacekeeping \r\noperations, on the peacebuilding architecture and on \r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolution \r\n1325 (2000), on women and peace and security, \r\nthis is an opportune moment for change. Promoting \r\nintergovernmental coherence and strengthening the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission and the partnerships \r\nneeded for its maintenance are recommendations that \r\nwill improve the United Nations system. Our efforts to \r\nrespond to the challenges facing our nations and our \r\npeoples need to be more effective.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

We all know — and Timor-Leste has first-\r\nhand experience in the matter —  that the United \r\nNations is essential to ensuring the security of peoples \r\nand countries throughout the world. We therefore \r\nreiterate our belief in the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and in a multilateral and international \r\nsystem, as we are aware of the fact that the world has \r\na continuing need to maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity, establish friendly relations among countries, \r\nwork in cooperation to find solutions to global problems \r\nand foster respect for human rights.\r\nSuch goals can be achieved only if countries \r\nactively seek solutions to the problems they face. Such \r\na belief is confirmed by the results that Timor-Leste \r\nhas achieved. Using the lessons that we have learned, \r\nwe wish to contribute to the dreams and hopes of other \r\ncountries. Through the Group of Seven Plus and based \r\non the principles of the New Deal for Engagement in \r\nFragile States, we are sharing our experiences and \r\nknowledge with a group of 20 fragile States affected \r\nby conflict.\r\nRegional integration generates opportunities \r\nfor the economic development and well-being of a \r\npopulation and also contributes to peace and stability in \r\ncountries and regions. For that reason, we aspire to join \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, so that we \r\ncan have an opportunity to fulfil both the dreams of our \r\npeople and our responsibility to form an integral part of \r\ncivilization. It is that same principle that drove Timor-\r\nLeste, both as a member and during its presidency of \r\nthe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries, to \r\npropose the concept of economic potential within the \r\ntransregional constellation, which includes Europe, \r\nAfrica, the Americas and Asia, for debate among its \r\nmember States.\r\nTo that end, and in order to promote development \r\nand the resulting improvement in the living conditions \r\nof its people, we appeal to the United States of America \r\nto urgently remove its trade, financial, and economic \r\nembargoes against the Republic of Cuba.\r\nWe are well aware that peace and development are \r\nintrinsically linked, which is a concept that we were \r\ndetermined to include in Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, which was adopted one \r\nyear ago. There must be no doubt of the fact that without \r\npeace and stability, we cannot envisage development, \r\nand vice versa. The new Goals are for all countries, so \r\nthat all may benefit from sustainable development. \r\nLast year, in addition to being one of the first \r\ncountries in the world to subscribe to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), Timor-Leste joined a \r\ngroup of eight countries that wish to serve as models \r\nfor the implementation of the Agenda by pooling best \r\npractices and experience.Over the past year, we have \r\nestablished an interministerial working group that, in \r\ncollaboration with civil-society organizations and our \r\ndevelopment partners, has mapped indicators for the 17 \r\nGoals to transform our world and selected 20 targets \r\nthat will enable us to monitor their implementation on \r\nthe basis of quantitative results. \r\nWe have endeavoured to raise our partners’ \r\nawareness of the importance of harmonizing our agendas \r\nand of the need for financial aid in order to achieve \r\nresults. We are also planning a high-level international \r\nconference in March 2017 to discuss ways to advance \r\nthe 2030 Agenda under very difficult circumstances. \r\nWe have improved our commitment to show our young \r\npeople, the future generation, how important their \r\nrole is in achieving those Goals, to which we all must \r\ncontribute and from which we will all benefit. Such an \r\nexercise is not easy, yet our Government has attempted \r\nto be mindful of the Goals in its budget and in activity-\r\nplanning.\r\nWe have also developed additional plans and have \r\nincluded the SDGs in the review of Timor-Leste’s \r\nstrategic development plan for the period 2011-2030. \r\nWe want the plan’s impact on our population to be real \r\nand to benefit every citizen,  whether old or young, from \r\nthe city or the remotest village, in the short, medium, \r\nand long term.  Our experience has already shown that \r\nwe can achieve an impact, for example in the health \r\nsector. Health is our most precious asset, and we want \r\nto offer quality health care that benefits and impacts \r\nour population.\r\nIt gives me great satisfaction to share with the \r\nAssembly the fact that Timor-Leste —  according to a \r\nstudy of 188 countries published in the 21 September \r\nissue of the British medical journal The Lancet —- is \r\nthe country that has attained the most progress towards \r\nachieving the health-related Millennium Development \r\nGoals since 2000, as a result of the country’s peaceful \r\nand stable environment and its efforts to broaden access \r\nto health care. We have also joined the antibiotic-\r\nresistance campaign. Concerted action among our \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 3/52\r\ncountries will help to reduce the number of cases of \r\nresistance and increase the number of lives saved, \r\nboth human and animal, thanks to the appropriate \r\nadministration of medications.\r\nThe world must place fellow human beings’ \r\nphysical and moral well-being and human dignity \r\nabove all other interests. The situation of refugees \r\nand migrants remains unresolved and deserves our \r\nfocused attention and support. There is a continuing \r\nneed for a joint solution to end that situation affecting \r\nthousands of people, including children. We still need \r\nto establish frank political dialogue and international \r\npartnerships to ensure respect for human rights and \r\nenable humanitarian assistance.\r\nOther major scourges persist in aff licting the \r\nworld. The conflicts in Syria, South Sudan and Yemen, \r\namong others, are far from being resolved. We hope \r\nthat the recent ceasefire in Syria may be a step on the \r\npath to peace and that conditions may be created for the \r\ndelivery of humanitarian assistance to those who most \r\ndepend on it for their survival. \r\nWe also urgently need to find a solution together \r\nthat would ensure the right to self-determination for \r\nthe Saharawi people, as well as a just solution for the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Palestinian people, which \r\nmust be respected.\r\nAs a country that has experienced conflict, Timor-\r\nLeste knows all too well the high price of war and how \r\nwe must do everything to avoid it, through preventive \r\ndiplomacy and by strengthening the institutions of \r\nthe State. In addition to contributing to the Group of \r\nSeven Plus, we are willing, as we have done in the \r\npast, to be among those who contribute contingents to \r\npeacekeeping operations and thereby demonstrate our \r\ngratitude to the international community. Timor-Leste’s \r\npast and present can serve as an example and a source \r\nof hope; after it emerged from conflict, Timor-Leste \r\nbecame a peaceful country that now enjoys security \r\nand stability and whose people can benefit from the \r\ndividends of peace.\r\nEven when countries emerge from conflict \r\nsituations, there may remain issues of security that \r\ncontinue to threaten nations. Acts of terrorism, \r\norganized crime and threats to peace and stability have \r\nbeen constant and rather worrisome. The fight against \r\nterrorism and all those drivers of instability in the world \r\nand our societies require a commitment from all of us \r\nto work together towards a lasting solution.\r\nBy ratifying the relevant conventions, Timor-Leste \r\nhas strengthened its commitment to contributing to the \r\nfight against terrorism and organized crime related to \r\nthe financing of those activities. Money-laundering and \r\nillicit financial f lows linked to terrorism are intimately \r\nconnected with organized crime, and we are aware of \r\nthe importance of simultaneously fighting piracy and \r\nthe trafficking in drugs, persons and arms.\r\nSuch crimes are sometimes committed at sea or \r\nthrough maritime activities. In order to combat them \r\nand safeguard our economic potential, we must also \r\nprotect our borders and ensure maritime security. We \r\nare a maritime nation, and for us the sea is highly \r\nand strategically important. To explore the potential \r\nthat living and non-living maritime resources offer \r\nis to give ourselves the opportunity to diversify our \r\neconomy through fishing activities, the development of \r\ntourism and the development of non-living resources. \r\nThat requires sustainable development, which is \r\ndoubly beneficial, not just for humankind but also \r\nfor the environment. We appreciate the efforts of \r\nFiji and Sweden in organizing the high-level United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14 on oceans, to be held \r\nin New York in June 2017.\r\nAll countries across the globe must take urgent \r\naction to combat climate change and its impacts. Island \r\nnations such as Timor-Leste are truly affected by the \r\nchallenges brought about by climate change. Given \r\nour commitment to combat global warming and not \r\nto compromise biodiversity and marine ecosystems, \r\nin April we signed the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, which is currently in the process of being \r\nratified in our National Parliament.\r\nIn addition to that global concern, Timor-Leste \r\nalso faces the challenge of establishing sovereign rights \r\nover our surrounding seas through the delineation of \r\nour maritime borders. Even 14 years after Timor-Leste \r\nbecame the one hundred and ninety-first Member \r\nof the United Nations, we still do not have agreed \r\nand defined maritime borders with our two maritime \r\nneighbours, Indonesia and Australia. The delineation of \r\nour maritime borders will ensure our sovereign rights \r\nand give us certainty with respect to what belongs to \r\nus, thereby ensuring our economic stability, even our \r\nself-sufficiency, and a better future for our people and \r\nour nation.\r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n4/52 16-29811\r\nWe are staunch advocates of dialogue and the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes. We believe in the \r\nmultilateral system and international law, in which all \r\nStates are equal before the law, regardless of their size \r\nor wealth. On the basis of those principles ensuring \r\nequality among nations  we began discussions with a \r\nview to delimiting our maritime borders with Indonesia \r\nunder international law. We hope to do the same with \r\nAustralia in a true spirit of openness, transparency \r\nand friendship.\r\nFor that reason, in April Timor-Leste began a \r\nprocess of compulsory conciliation, a mechanism to \r\nresolve disputes under the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea. The process, which is being used \r\nfor the first time, was specifically conceived for cases \r\nsuch as Timor-Leste’s, where there is a dispute regarding \r\nmaritime borders with a neighbour that withdrew \r\nfrom binding dispute resolution procedures under \r\ninternational law. The first meeting of the compulsory \r\nConciliation Commission was held on 29 August, and \r\nwe are confident that the panel of independent experts, \r\nafter reviewing each country’s position, will contribute \r\nto reaching an amicable solution. We are certain that \r\nAustralia, an important country in our region, will \r\nparticipate and contribute in a positive manner to \r\nfinding a just solution acceptable to both parties.\r\nIn 2015, Timor-Leste undertook a commitment to \r\nassiduously work with all nations so that together we \r\ncan implement a transformational agenda designed to \r\nshift the world onto a sustainable and resilient path. The \r\nSustainable Development Goals also include targets, \r\nand we must ensure the contribution of all nations to \r\ntheir implementation. In that regard, we can never stress \r\nenough the need to find solutions to the challenges that \r\nhumankind faces, solutions that we must pursue in a \r\nspirit of solidarity, as well as the importance of acting \r\nin a coordinated fashion,\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate Timor-Leste’s belief in the \r\nmultilateral system and in advocating for fundamental \r\nvalues such as peace and human rights. We would also \r\nlike to renew our commitment to the preservation of \r\ndemocracy, the rule of law, sustainable development, \r\nrespect for international law and the buildingof  a better \r\nfuture for all peoples and nations, now and in the future.\r\nOn behalf of Timor-Leste, I truly wish that your \r\nterm of office, Mr. President, will be crowned by \r\nsuccess. Failure is not an option, because humankind \r\nis in urgent need of change to ensure the preservation \r\nof its existence.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Timor-Leste for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Rui Maria de Araújo, Prime Minister of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Timor-Leste, was escorted \r\nfrom the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Allen Michael Chastanet, \r\nPrime Minister of Saint Lucia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia.\r\nMr. Allen Michael Chastanet, Prime Minister of \r\nSaint Lucia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Allen Michael \r\nChastanet, Prime Minister of Saint Lucia, and inviting \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Chastanet (Saint Lucia): It is with the greatest \r\npleasure, Sir, that I welcome you to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-first session. We in \r\nSaint Lucia are particularly pleased that the presidency \r\nhas passed to a representative of a fellow small \r\nisland developing State. I also take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate, through you, Mr. President, the \r\nGovernment and the people of Fiji on their gold-medal \r\nvictory in the rugby sevens competition at the 2016 \r\nOlympic Games. I sincerely hope that our efforts during \r\nthe early decades of the twenty-first century will help \r\ncreate a new world similar to the level playing field that \r\nenables athletes from small island States like ours to \r\ncompete successfully with those from the super-Powers \r\nof the world.\r\nOn a personal note, it is an honour to address the \r\nAssembly as the eighth Prime Minister of Saint Lucia. \r\nI come before it humbled by the responsibility that \r\nthe people of Saint Lucia have placed upon me and \r\nmy Administration. We are mindful of the enormous \r\nchallenges of our moment in history, and we are \r\ndetermined to act boldly and collectively on behalf of \r\njustice and prosperity — at home and abroad. At home \r\nwe have given our people a commitment to build a \r\nprosperous and progressive Saint Lucia for the benefit \r\nof all citizens. We are fully aware that we can succeed \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 5/52\r\nin that mission only with the support of those nations \r\nwith which we interact.\r\nI have assumed office at a time when many \r\naround the world, like many in my own country, are \r\ndiscontented with the status quo. Theirs is a discontent \r\nwith the ideologies, policies, institutions, and patterns \r\nof behaviour that were established in a time long past to \r\ndeal with circumstances long gone. The old habits and \r\nold arguments are irrelevant and harmful to the finding \r\nsolutions to the challenges faced by the people today. As \r\na result, there is considerable frustration fuelling acts \r\nof terror throughout the world, which have escalated \r\ninto major conflicts.\r\nWe recognize that it is through dialogue and \r\nmutual respect that we can begin to address long-\r\nstanding conflicts. We therefore welcome the warming \r\nof relations between two of our neighbours and call on \r\nthe United States to take the next step by lifting the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo against \r\nCuba. A strong Cuban economy would strengthen the \r\nregion in general.\r\nThere is no doubt whatsoever that we face many \r\nchallenges within our international community. But \r\nthe majority of our challenges are, at their most basic, \r\nsymptomatic of a single underlying issue: the denial \r\nof access to basic human rights, including education, \r\nhealth care, justice and security. We must accept that \r\nthose pillars are fundamental human rights and, as such, \r\nare the very foundation upon which our nations must \r\ngrow. Our failure to provide and ensure those rights to \r\nour citizens in crucial areas of life breeds dangerous \r\nchallenges that mushroom beyond national and regional \r\nborders and impact us all in the global community.\r\nWe leaders gather in this great Hall every year \r\nto engage in the general debate and deliberate on the \r\nchallenges and successes of the international order. Yet \r\nthe very format of the debate is problematical, given \r\nthat while many speak, few stay around to listen, far \r\nless respond. Is it any wonder, then, how and why this \r\nentity is so negatively perceived by the persons who \r\nelected us to serve? As a small island State and Member \r\nof this body, our voice is meant to be equal, but long \r\nexperience and realpolitik have proven the contrary. \r\nInstead of being invited to participate in finding a \r\ncure for the cause of our challenges, we are forced to \r\naccept remedies proposed by others to the symptoms of \r\nthe maladies.\r\nGiven our small size and limited choices for \r\neconomic expansion, small island States like my \r\nown have looked to the more advanced economies \r\nfor innovative means of economic development. We \r\nhave adopted programmes created by those States, \r\nsuch as the citizenship-by-investment programmes, \r\nfinancial services and trusts. Yet we find ourselves \r\nbeing penalized and criticized by the very architects of \r\nsuch programmes, as they brand us as tax havens and \r\ncompromise our ability to grow our economies. We are \r\ntherefore left to dance between the raindrops.\r\nA painful example of such exclusion is the \r\ninescapable fact that, while we continue to feel the \r\nnegative effects of the 2008-2009 global financial and \r\neconomic crisis, we are not involved in the solutions \r\nto the problems. As we know, the Group of 20 (G-20) \r\nhas designated itself as the forum for our collective \r\ninternational economic cooperation. However, Saint \r\nLucia, like the majority of the States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, is not a member of the G-20, and we \r\nwere not consulted on its appointment as the arbiters of \r\nour economic fate.\r\nThe G-20 also has a serious legitimacy problem. \r\nAside from being unofficial and non-inclusive, many of \r\nthe countries at the table represent the champions of the \r\nexisting economic and financial systems and policies \r\nthat led the world into the crisis in the first place. \r\nThe crisis has produced increased poverty, suffering \r\nand social and political upheaval in our States. Its \r\ndisproportionate impact on the poor has only widened \r\nthe gap between developing and developed countries.\r\nThe current combination of the real impacts of \r\nglobal warming, the financial crisis and stagnant global \r\neconomies has left many small island middle-income \r\ncountries in a state of high debt and unemployment. \r\nAnd the new threat of de-risking will cause further \r\ndeterioration in our economies.\r\nWhile we fully support the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change and its ambition to deal with global \r\nwarming, we are patiently waiting for its financing \r\nto be agreed. In the light of that, we wholeheartedly \r\nendorse the call by the Prime Minister of Jamaica for \r\nan initiative to assist highly indebted middle-income \r\ncountries, underpinned by the principle that their \r\nstructural vulnerabilities cannot be eliminated \r\nby diversification.\r\nEvery single Member State should be honest in \r\nshouldering its responsibilities. Nothing is easier than \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n6/52 16-29811\r\nblaming others for our troubles and absolving ourselves \r\nof responsibility for our choices and our actions. True \r\nleadership in this new world order demands much \r\nmore. We must bring ourselves in tune with the call of \r\nthe times.\r\nWe say that our destinies are interlinked, as we \r\nhave all adopted a universal approach to sustainable \r\ndevelopment through the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, but we still think in terms of a zero-sum game. \r\nThe truth is that the world has been endowed with \r\nabundant natural resources, which, if put to proper use, \r\ncould wipe out poverty throughout the world. There is \r\ntherefore no need to continue to create a world order \r\nthat elevates one nation or group of people over another.\r\nIn this Hall we come from many places, but we \r\nshare a common future. No longer do we have the \r\nluxury of indulging our differences to the neglect of \r\nthe work that we must do together. The magnitude of \r\nour challenges has yet to be met by the measure of our \r\nactions. The United Nations was founded on the belief \r\nthat the nations of the world should solve their problems \r\ntogether. It was rooted in the hard lessons of war and in \r\nthe wisdom that nations could advance their interests \r\nby acting together instead of holding steadfast to their \r\ninsular policies. The time has come for the world to \r\nmove in a new direction. The technological revolution \r\nof the twenty-first century is creating a new global \r\nvillage. We must embrace a new era of engagement \r\nbased on common needs, innovative ideas and mutual \r\nrespect. And that work must begin now.\r\nWe must decide whether the United Nations can \r\ncontinue to be a place where we continue our outdated \r\ngrievances or a place we begin to forge common \r\nground. We must decide to put less focus on what drives \r\nus apart and more emphasis on what brings us together. \r\nWe must decide to give renewed meaning to the promise \r\nembedded in the name given to this institution, namely, \r\nthe United Nations. Under my watch, Saint Lucia \r\nstands ready to collaborate more meaningfully with \r\nits neighbours in the emerging global village. We must \r\nadopt policies and programmes that put citizens and \r\ntheir basic human needs first. We must not accept easy \r\nfixes nor any solution that undermines the ability of \r\nany State to deliver on its promise to provide education, \r\nhealth care, justice and security to all its citizens.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Saint Lucia for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Allen Michael Chastanet, Prime Minister of \r\nSaint Lucia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, \r\nPrime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Antigua and Barbuda.\r\nMr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime Minister of \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime \r\nMinister of Antigua and Barbuda, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Browne (Antigua and Barbuda): On behalf \r\nof my Government and my people, I congratulate you, \r\nMr. President, on your election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nThis will be the last General Assembly at which \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon will serve the \r\npeoples of the world as Secretary-General. I wish to \r\nnow place on record my country’s great appreciation \r\nof his stewardship of our affairs. The task of the \r\nSecretary-General is not easy. Occupied with trying \r\nto resolve conflicts around the world, stop bloodshed, \r\nmediate diverse positions between Governments, \r\naddress hunger and malnutrition, uphold human rights, \r\nincluding the rights of women, refugees and vulnerable \r\ncommunities, work tirelessly to secure peace and ensure \r\ndevelopment in its widest meaning. All of that is deeply \r\nchallenging and enormously worrisome. Managing it \r\nall involves exhausting travel, the neglect of family \r\nresponsibilities, and wearisome nights without sleep. \r\nTherefore, on behalf of my people, I wish to record our \r\ndeep appreciation for all of the Secretary-General’s \r\nunstinting efforts.\r\nI thank him particularly for the 10 years of diligence \r\nthat he has devoted to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which our Governments adopted in \r\nSeptember 2015. The 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals to end poverty, fight inequality and injustice and \r\ntackle climate change by 2030 are of vital interest to the \r\nwell-being of small countries, such as mine. Of course, \r\nwe are disappointed that many of the Goals remain \r\naspirational and lack a legally binding commitment \r\nto the funding that is crucial for their implementation. \r\nBut we are realistic enough not to reject the good just \r\nbecause we did not get the perfect. We will continue to \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 7/52\r\nadvocate for fairness and equity in the fulfilment of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nMy small island State is also grateful to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his conscientiousness in \r\npromoting an agreement on climate change, which \r\nour nations collectively signed in Paris last year. My \r\nGovernment was pleased to deposit its instrument \r\nof ratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange earlier this week at here at Headquarters. I \r\nurge the countries that have not yet signed or ratified \r\nthe Agreement to do so without delay. Time is not on \r\nour side.\r\nI remind the representatives of all nations gathered \r\nin this Hall that the present pledges to reduce emissions \r\nare still insufficient to limit global temperature rise to \r\nwell below 2° Celsius and to build climate resilience. At \r\na rise of 1.5° Celsius, many of our countries — or parts \r\nof them — will still be washed away. Temperatures \r\ncontinue to rise, as the bell is tolling.\r\nThe bell may be tolling for small islands, but in the \r\nwords of the poet John Donne, “it also tolls for thee”. \r\nThe ravages of climate change will not end with the \r\nerosion of small island States, nor will its consequences \r\ndisappear with the last surging tide. Its refugees, its \r\ndisplaced people and the misery of its effects will wash \r\nup on the shores of those who dismiss or neglect the \r\nissue today.\r\nOur small countries endure the problems caused by \r\nclimate change not because we created it, but because \r\nwe are the victims of the polluting profligacy of others.\r\nBut we are not content to simply wring our hands in \r\nanguish or throw up our arms in despair. We are keen \r\nto help provide solutions. That is why my Government \r\nhas repeatedly proposed debt swaps for climate-change \r\nadaptation and mitigation. Many of our small island \r\nStates are burdened by high debt because we are denied \r\naccess to concessionary financing and are forced \r\nto borrow at high commercial rates to rebuild after \r\ndisasters and to mitigate against them. High debt is not \r\nonly a drag on our economic growth; it constrains our \r\nability to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nWe are caught in a very vicious cycle.\r\nWe have proposed that we be provided with soft \r\nloans to stop further high debt accumulation while we \r\nbuild resilience to global warming and sea-level rise. \r\nHowever, for us to qualify for soft loans, the international \r\nfinancial institutions and donor Governments must \r\nstop using per capita income as a criterion. So far, our \r\npleas have fallen on deaf ears. Beyond the facade of \r\nhigh per capita income is our increasing poverty, high \r\nlevels of household and individual vulnerability, acute \r\nissues in health and education and worrying rates of \r\nunemployment, especially among youth. High per \r\ncapita income distorts the reality that, because of the \r\nopenness of our small economies and our dependence \r\non foreign investment, a minority of the population \r\nearns the largest percentage of income, leaving the \r\nmajority at subsistence level and below.\r\nThose facts are known to international financial \r\ninstitutions and those who govern them, yet they are \r\nignored. The more appropriate criteria for allowing \r\naccess to concessionary financing should be our very \r\nwell-known vulnerability to shocks that are generated \r\nfrom outside our shores and over which we have no \r\ncontrol. The cost to institutions, such as the World \r\nBank, of refining their criteria would not be very \r\nhigh, but such access would represent a significant \r\nmeasure enabling our small countries to improve our \r\neconomic performance.I have to admit a deep sense of \r\nfrustration and disappointment that, year after year, \r\nother Heads of Government of small States and I have \r\ncome to the Assembly and explained the challenges \r\nthat confront us, but to no avail. We remain trapped \r\nin the reality of a narrow tax base, high debt, large \r\ntrade deficits, small underdeveloped domestic financial \r\nmarkets, small private sectors and fragile banking \r\nsystems. I remind the Assembly of Albert Einstein’s \r\nobservation: \r\n“In matters of truth and justice, there is no \r\ndifference between large and small problems, for \r\nissues concerning the treatment of people are all \r\nthe same.”\r\nThe truth of the situation facing small States is obvious \r\nto all; so too should be the need for justice. My country, \r\nhaving resumed negotiations with the Government \r\nof the United States on the outstanding World Trade \r\nOrganization matter, looks forward to a speedy \r\nresolution as we continue to find innovative ways to \r\nbuild our country.\r\nIn terms of the grave challenges to the economic \r\nviability facing my country and the Caribbean region, \r\nI can now point to an urgent and existential threat of \r\nconsiderable relevance to our survival. The latest \r\nchallenge that our countries face is the decision by \r\nglobal banks to discontinue correspondent banking \r\nrelations with our financial institutions. In the \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n8/52 16-29811\r\ninternational campaign against money laundering \r\nand terrorist financing, very strict penalties have \r\nbeen imposed on banks by regulatory bodies in North \r\nAmerica and Europe for any infringement of the \r\nstringent regulations.\r\nIn that environment, where even the slightest \r\ninfraction could expose a bank to a fine of hundreds \r\nof millions of dollars, many banks have chosen to \r\nwithdraw essential correspondent banking relations \r\nfrom financial institutions in the Caribbean, \r\nCentral America and Africa. They call that process \r\n“de-risking”. I call it economic destruction. It is now \r\nprevalent in the Caribbean, but it also exists in parts \r\nof Africa and Central America. It will spread, with \r\nglobal consequences, unless it is curbed through \r\ncollective action.\r\nAll those countries, including mine, are now \r\nat the point of losing vital correspondent banking \r\nrelationships. The consequences would be calamitous. \r\nWe would be severed from the world’s trading system, \r\nunable to pay for basic goods and services that we \r\npurchase or to receive payments for goods and services \r\nthat we sell to other countries. Remittances from \r\nour diaspora would be cut off, causing more of the \r\npopulation to depend on social welfare at a time when \r\nour economies are already under great stress.\r\nIn other words, a growing cancer is eating away at \r\ndevelopment — a cancer that is threatening the stability \r\nof our region and denying us the right to participate in \r\nthe international economy. But that is not all. Since the \r\nconsequence of being cut off from the world trading \r\nsystem would be economic collapse, not only would \r\npoverty and crime dramatically increase, so too would \r\nthe very global scourges that every nation fears — an \r\nincrease in refugees and human trafficking.\r\nThe consequences would not be limited to our \r\ncountries. Worse yet, financial transactions that are \r\nnow regulated and monitored by law enforcement \r\nagencies would be forced underground, creating huge \r\nopportunities for money laundering and terrorism \r\nfinancing. That would undermine the global, multilateral \r\ncooperation that is required to fight those scourges. \r\nAnd it is important to be aware of the fact that, in all \r\nthe money laundering and terrorism financing cases \r\nthat have been prosecuted in the world, not one of them \r\ninvolved a Caribbean financial institution. \r\nDe-risking is a substantial matter; its far-reaching \r\nconsequences could create fundamental problems for \r\nour countries. The threat that we face in the Caribbean \r\nis real; the danger is imminent. But, make no mistake, \r\nno country will be immune from its consequences if it \r\nis left unchecked.\r\nI am grateful to the Managing Director of the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund, Ms. Christine Lagarde, \r\nfor her timely and important statement made on 18 July \r\nat the New York Federal Reserve, in which she said,\r\n“I am concerned that not all is well in this \r\nworld of small countries with small financial \r\nsystems. In fact, there is a risk that they become \r\nmore marginalized.”\r\nShe went on to say that\r\n“all actors have a part to play: countries need to \r\nupgrade their regulatory frameworks; regulators \r\nin key financial centres need to clarify regulatory \r\nexpectations and ensure consistent application over \r\ntime; and global banks need to avoid knee-jerk \r\nreactions and find sensible ways to reduce their \r\ncosts. There is a lot at stake. For both the big and \r\nthe small. For all of us.”\r\nMs. Lagarde could not be more right, and her \r\nsummons to the international community should be a \r\nclarion call to all.\r\nIn the case of the Caribbean, my colleagues the \r\nHeads of Government of the Caribbean Community \r\nmandated me to convene a high-level conference on \r\nthat matter to address it in a holistic fashion.  It will \r\nbe held in Antigua on 27 and 28 October, and I have \r\nalready issued invitations to key global stakeholders.. \r\nOur objective at that conference will be to work \r\ncollectively to end that huge threat to the well-being \r\nof our region. We are acting responsibly, and I call \r\non the General Assembly to recognize the substantial \r\nand dangerous nature of this issue, and to join us in \r\naddressing it constructively.\r\nOur nations operate in the United Nations system \r\nin the context of some kind of global order. It is a \r\nglobal order that is supposed to be underpinned by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Reference is often made \r\nto the first goal cited in the Preamble to the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, which is “to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, which twice in \r\nour lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind”.\r\nIt is of course right that we should do so. For \r\neven though that principle is enshrined in the Charter \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 9/52\r\nand is legally binding on all Member States, conflict \r\nand carnage continue in several parts of the world, \r\nparticularly the Middle East. And, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral lamented in his presentation of his report on \r\nthe work of the Organization (A/71/1) to this session \r\nof the General Assembly, “Powerful patrons who keep \r\nfeeding the war machine also have blood on their \r\nhands.” (see A/71/PV.8).\r\nBut, at least in recent years, wars have been reduced \r\nand isolated. In that regard, the commitment of States \r\nto the Charter has made our world a safer place for the \r\nmajority of our people.\r\nHowever, it is the other three goals in the Preamble \r\nthat our nations have yet to meet. And because of that \r\nfailure, developing countries and small States such as \r\nmine remain marginalized, outside the bounty of the \r\nworld. I remind everyone of those three goals:\r\n“To reaffirm faith in fundamental human \r\nrights, in the dignity and worth of the human \r\nperson, in the equal rights of men and women and \r\nof nations large and small, and\r\n“To establish conditions under which justice \r\nand respect for the obligations arising from treaties \r\nand other sources of international law can be \r\nmaintained, and\r\n“To promote social progress and better \r\nstandards of life in larger freedom”.\r\nThe global order under which we live and conduct \r\nour relations pays only lip service to those principles \r\nand ideals. That is why Guantánamo Bay in Cuba is \r\nstill occupied by the United States and the United \r\nStates embargo on that country continues, despite the \r\nwishes of the people and the Government of Cuba. That \r\nis why bodies such as the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development, a club for rich countries, \r\nUnilaterally make rules on financial matters, which they \r\nimpose on other countries, which have no say. That is \r\nwhy powerful countries brand regions in the Caribbean \r\nand Pacific as tax havens, with all the negative and \r\nharmful consequences that such branding entails. \r\nThat is why the Caribbean region can be arbitrarily \r\nand unfairly severed from vital correspondent banking \r\nrelationships. That is why countries such as mine have \r\nno voice of our own and no vote in the decision-making \r\ncouncils of the international financial institutions that \r\nmake and implement the rules that materially affect \r\nour lives.\r\n“Might is right” continues to be the principle \r\nunderpinning the mentality of the powerful. But \r\nour world cannot be free from poverty, conflict, \r\nterror, inequity and injustice while the powerful take \r\nadvantage of the weak. In the words of the Reverend \r\nMartin Luther King, Jr., “Injustice anywhere is a threat \r\nto justice everywhere.” It is time that the global order \r\nrecognize that self-evident truth.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Gaston Alphonso Browne, Prime Minister \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Timothy Harris, Prime \r\nMinister of Saint Kitts and Nevis\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Timothy Harris, Prime Minister of Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Timothy Harris, Prime Minister \r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Harris (Saint Kitts and Nevis): On behalf of \r\nthe Government and the people of our proud Federation \r\nof Saint Kitts and Nevis, Mr. President, I would like to \r\ncongratulate you on your election to lead the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session, and I thank you \r\nfor the honour of addressing the Assembly.\r\nWe know that under your tenure, Mr. President, \r\nwe will focus on striving for the key development \r\ngoals for 2030 — people, planet, prosperity, peace and \r\npartnership. They represent broad global issues that \r\nare of particular concern to the small island developing \r\nStates of the Caribbean region. Indeed, many of the \r\nproblems facing our world today are linked and should \r\nbe addressed holistically and multilaterally.\r\nToday in various corners of the world we see masses \r\nof people losing faith in the ability of established \r\ninstitutions to defend their interests and respond \r\nadequately to their needs. On an almost daily basis we \r\nwitness an increase in acts of violence against innocent \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n10/52 16-29811\r\npeople. We look on, seemingly helpless, as large groups \r\nof people feel alienated and isolated in their own \r\ncountries, with some of them forced to uproot their \r\nfamilies and risk their lives to escape armed conflict in \r\nsearch of security and better opportunities.\r\nIt is clear that the causes of many of those problems \r\nare rooted in years of social neglect and entrenched \r\neconomic inequities. We cannot resolve them by simply \r\ndismissing people’s fears, stereotyping them or resorting \r\nto isolationism, xenophobia and protectionism. Our \r\nresponse must be to develop better partnerships and \r\nfind common ground. Our global challenges demand \r\nthat we build bridges, not walls. We must strengthen \r\nour commitment to multilateralism and cooperation. \r\nWe must empower international institutions, civil \r\nsociety and the private sector to play a much greater \r\nrole. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nprovide a perfect platform and framework for achieving \r\nthat in partnership.\r\nEmpowering our young people is critically \r\nimportant to the transformation of our world. There is a \r\ncommon view that significant intervention is required \r\nin order to nurture aspiration, vision, leadership and a \r\nsense of civic responsibility. By providing opportunities \r\nfor the constructive engagement of young people in \r\ncritical matters that directly affect them and society, \r\nwe can transform their frustration into meaningful \r\nempowerment. We should tackle head-on the increased \r\nincidence of youth-on-youth violence, which is \r\ninvariably symptomatic of deeper societal issues. We \r\ncannot dismiss young people’s evident despair. We \r\nhave to adopt a multisectoral and integrated approach in \r\norder to find ways to make them see that violence is not \r\nthe answer. In Saint Kitts and Nevis we have focused \r\non job creation, skills enhancement, entrepreneurship, \r\ncounselling and support to teenage mothers and the \r\nprovision of other targeted social services.\r\nIt is important to note that on 4 July 2011, in keeping \r\nwith our commitment to working more collaboratively \r\nto halt the proliferation of small arms and light weapons, \r\nthe Caribbean Governments adopted the Declaration \r\non Small Arms and Light Weapons of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM) in my own country’s capital \r\nof Basseterre. Those weapons have had devastating \r\neffects on many young lives and families. Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis has now signed and ratified the Arms Trade \r\nTreaty, but we are still in need of much support.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, like so many small island \r\ndeveloping States, remains inherently vulnerable, owing \r\nmainly to our small physical size, open economy, lack \r\nof economies of scale and, of course, small population. \r\nAs we have seen time and again, a climate event that \r\nlasts only a few hours can wreak havoc on every single \r\naspect of life on our islands. In the past we have asked \r\nthat the international community address the issue \r\nof creating a strategy for the promotion of climate \r\nfinancing, and I once again reiterate that call. It is \r\nmeaningless to say that billions of dollars are available \r\nfor climate financing if the mechanisms for accessing \r\nthe money are opaque, prohibitive and extremely \r\ndifficult to penetrate. Again, I urge common-sense \r\ncooperation and partnership.\r\nWe are being further marginalized in the global \r\nfinancial system. Already in the Caribbean, as of \r\nthe first half of this year, some 16 banks across five \r\ncountries have lost all or some of their correspondent \r\nbanking relationships, putting the financial lifeline of \r\nthose countries at great risk. In our economies, which \r\ndepend heavily on tourism and remittances as major \r\nfactors in national development, such actions threaten \r\nto derail progress and undermine trade, direct foreign \r\ninvestment and the repatriation of business profits. \r\nFurthermore, we urge the Group of Seven, the \r\nGroup of 20 and the international financial institutions \r\nto re-evaluate the methodologies used to assess whether \r\nand how a country qualifies for concessional support \r\nor access to certain types of international funds. \r\nThe arbitrary classification of certain small nations, \r\nlike Saint Kitts and Nevis — or Dominica, for that \r\nmatter — as middle-income countries can never make \r\nsense when such a country might see its economy \r\ngrow from 4 to 6 per cent in one year and then watch \r\nhelplessly as nearly 100 per cent of its gross domestic \r\nproduct is wiped out in six hours of wind and rainfall \r\nfrom a tropical storm. Any new formula must include \r\nvulnerability and resilience indices.\r\nAs the Prime Minister in the CARICOM quasi-\r\ncabinet with lead responsibility for health and human \r\ndevelopment, I encourage this body and like-minded \r\nGovernments to join me in re-energizing our efforts \r\nto fight non-communicable diseases and antimicrobial \r\nresistance, as well as communicable diseases like HIV/\r\nAIDS. That fight is consistent with international efforts \r\nto meet our SDG targets. It serves to promote human \r\nsecurity, improve individual choices and empower \r\ncitizens. Saint Kitts and Nevis is grateful to the General \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 11/52\r\nAssembly for its continued advocacy, as well as to the \r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS for \r\nits support to the Pan-Caribbean Partnership against \r\nHIV and AIDS, which has been declared an example \r\nof international best practices. We are also proud of \r\nthe strides that we have made in reducing mother-to-\r\nchild infection at birth by 97 per cent, and of our efforts \r\nto ensure ongoing and more cost-effective access \r\nto antiretroviral drugs and treatment and to reduce, \r\nthrough education, the stigma associated with the \r\ndisease. But the battle is far from won. The Caribbean \r\nis still an area of very high prevalence.\r\nIt is essential to invest more in education in order \r\nto promote healthier lives and healthier food choices, as \r\nwell as to help people make the right lifestyle choices, \r\nbecause several of the non-communicable diseases are \r\npreventable. In the long term, by implementing the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the SDGs, we \r\ncan reduce the enormous costs of treatments associated \r\nwith non-communicable diseases, which in turn could \r\ncontribute significantly to meaningful economic \r\ndevelopment. It is worth the investment so that we can \r\nprotect our most critical national asset — our people. In \r\nall our efforts, they matter most.\r\nMany of the difficulties that I have outlined have \r\nbeen made less burdensome because the Government \r\nand the people of Saint Kitts and Nevis have been \r\nfortunate enough to have benefited from some durable \r\nand meaningful partnerships, which have been integral \r\nto our efforts to build resilience, transform our country, \r\nmodernize our economy, upgrade our workforce, educate \r\nour people and empower our citizenry. There have also \r\nbeen outstanding models of South-South cooperation \r\nworthy of emulation. For example, Cuba’s support to \r\nthe developing world in education and training, health \r\ncare, agriculture and heritage development dwarfs the \r\nassistance of many economically advanced countries. \r\nVenezuela’s Bolivarian energy outreach through Petro \r\nCaribe is an important model. There must be a greater \r\ncommitment to share prosperity.\r\nAdditionally, in the past three decades, the tangible \r\nsupport of the Government and the people of Taiwan has \r\nbeen remarkable. Taiwan has stood shoulder to shoulder \r\nwith the Government and the people of Saint Kitts and \r\nNevis and remains steadfast in its commitment to support \r\nour determination to meet our people-empowerment \r\nagenda. Their help and solidarity touch almost every \r\nfacet of life in our twin-island federation. Such \r\nadvantages and benefits should not be limited to a \r\nfew countries. I know that Taiwan is eager to share its \r\nprogress and development successes with the rest of \r\nthe world. I therefore recommend new opportunities \r\nfor Taiwan and its people to be warmly welcomed and \r\nintegrated into the international fraternity of nations as \r\na global player whose commitment to the principles of \r\ndemocracy, peace and people empowerment can touch \r\nmany more lives.\r\nThe future of our planet and our citizens cannot be \r\noutsourced to any one country or group of countries. \r\nIn today’s highly interdependent and integrated world, \r\nthat future is our collective commons, demanding the \r\nfull engagement of all countries and their citizens.\r\nLastly, I would like to sound a cautionary note. My \r\nGovernment, like most of the international community, \r\nbelieves that the recent nuclear tests conducted by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea constitute a \r\nthreat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula \r\nand in the world in general. Such nuclear tests violate \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2270 (2016) and the well-\r\nestablished regime relating to the non-proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons. Saint Kitts and Nevis stands resolutely \r\nwith those who seek to ensure a peaceful world free of \r\nthe ravages of war and violence.\r\nMr. Mnatsakanyan (Armenia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nDespite the many challenges we face, I am convinced \r\nthat we can achieve our individual goals by working \r\ntogether as an international community to make the \r\nright decisions and triumph over adversity. Now is the \r\ntime for a bolder and grander vision of partnership. As \r\nthe peoples of the world, we joined together to celebrate \r\nour achievement in the SDGs. As the peoples of the \r\nworld, we achieved a landmark climate deal at the Paris \r\nConference on Climate Change. They are examples \r\nof what we can do working together for the ultimate \r\nbenefit of all. Let us now, therefore, resolve to achieve \r\neven greater success in the years leading up to 2030.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Timothy Harris, Prime Minister of Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n12/52 16-29811\r\nAddress by Mr. Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Swaziland.\r\nMr. Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Barnabas Sibusiso \r\nDlamini, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Swaziland, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Dlamini (Swaziland): I bring warm and \r\nfraternal greetings from His Majesty King Mswati \r\nIII, Head of State and iNgwenyama of the Kingdom of \r\nEswatini, the Queen Mother Indlovukati and the entire \r\nSwazi nation. His Majesty would have loved to join \r\neveryone for this eminent occasion. However, owing \r\nto other pressing engagements, he has delegated me to \r\nrepresent him and deliver the national statement of the \r\nKingdom of Eswatini. Our Kingdom is committed to \r\ncontributing to global issues that affect humankind in \r\nthe universe.\r\nAllow me to express our sincere congratulations to \r\nthe President on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session and to commend \r\nthe leadership of His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\noutgoing Secretary-General, who has performed a \r\nsterling job as leader of the Organization for the past \r\n10 years. We also congratulate the United Nations staff \r\nfor the remarkable work that they do in many parts \r\nof the world, in which they promote peace and create \r\na conducive environment for humankind to live in, \r\nsometimes under very difficult situations.\r\nThe theme of this session —  “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform \r\nour world” — calls upon all of us to contribute to the \r\ndevelopment of our respective countries and continents. \r\nThis theme is indeed a cross-cutting subject that \r\ncovers every aspect of life. We are pleased to inform \r\nthe General Assembly that the Kingdom has done \r\na lot to mainstream and popularize the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) through public-awareness \r\ncampaigns, education and training at all levels. The \r\nKingdom of Eswatini has also integrated the Goals into \r\nthe national development framework. Furthermore, \r\nappropriate institutional arrangements have been put in \r\nplace to ensure that the implementation of the Goals is \r\nproperly monitored at all levels.\r\nBoth the executive and legislative arms of \r\nGovernment are fully involved, and the progress \r\nachieved is periodically reported to the Cabinet and \r\nParliament. Our purpose is to achieve all-inclusiveness \r\nin the implementation of the SDGs. In that way, we seek \r\nto infuse the spirit of ownership into every citizen, so \r\nthat they understand and appreciate the importance \r\nof the SDGs and why they need to participate in the \r\nimplementation of the Goals, because we do not want \r\nto leave anyone behind.\r\nIt is important to underline that the implementation \r\nprocess is at its infancy stage. Furthermore, as expected, \r\nthe process is faced with teething challenges owing to \r\nlimited human, technological and financial resources, \r\nto name but a few. \r\nThe Government has translated the national \r\nvision, Vision 2022, into practical and feasible targets \r\nto expedite economic growth and focus the country’s \r\nefforts on achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We have established procedures for tracking \r\nprogress in the attainment of first-world status. The \r\nindicators set cover eight focal areas: economic \r\nprosperity, education, health care, service delivery, \r\ninfrastructure, agricultural and environmental \r\nsustainability, governance and corruption.\r\nIt is against that backdrop that we have revised \r\nthe national development strategy with a view to \r\nemphasizing linkages between the national development \r\nagenda, the SDGs and the African Union’s Agenda \r\n2063: The Africa We Want. For example, education \r\nand training are aligned to Sustainable Development \r\nGoals 1, 4, and 5. That thematic area is also linked to \r\ngoals 1, 2, and 18 of Agenda 2063. The country will \r\nimprove the quality of education by enacting policies \r\nthat will revolutionize the education system in the \r\nKingdom. The State will direct efforts towards the \r\nintroduction of science, technology and innovation, as \r\nwell as the redesign and presentation of technical and \r\nvocational training and education in entrepreneurship \r\nat the primary-school level so as to inculcate a culture \r\nof innovation, creativity and entrepreneurship at a \r\ntender age.\r\nHealth care is one of our top national priorities, \r\nwhich is in line with thematic area 4, which focuses \r\non good health. And that thematic area links directly \r\nto goals 1 and 3 of Agenda 2063 and Sustainable \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 13/52\r\nDevelopment Goals 1, 2, 3, and 6. Under that thematic \r\narea, the strategies prioritized for the country’s health \r\nsector include promoting health throughout one’s life, \r\ndisease prevention, prompt and efficient management \r\nof medical and related conditions, rehabilitation and \r\ninfluencing health-related activities in the relevant \r\nprimary sectors. The country will specifically \r\nstrengthen health-care financing and investment \r\nand fast-track the establishment of a national health-\r\ninsurance system to ensure the equity, efficiency and \r\neffectiveness in the provision of health services.\r\nUnder thematic area 5, the country has prioritized \r\nthe construction of infrastructure, which will \r\nultimately eradicate the hurdles associated with being \r\na landlocked country. To that end, the Government has \r\nprioritized road construction and the maintenance of \r\nroads and buildings, civil aviation, sustainable energy, \r\nresearch and technology development, safe water \r\nsupply and sanitation, water-resource development, \r\nhousing and human settlements, communications, the \r\nenvironment, climate change and disaster management. \r\nThose priorities of the Government of Swaziland link \r\nto goals 7 and 10 of Agenda 2063 and SDGs 6, 7, 9, 11, \r\n13 and 15.\r\nFurthermore, the country will increase its rail \r\nnetwork from 300 to 429 kilometres, as well as establish \r\na rail-safety regulator, and will further explore the \r\npossibility of making rail transportation competitive \r\nwith road transport.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini will continue with the \r\nimplementations of such programmes, as they are key \r\nto our development agenda.\r\nWe have also made significant improvements in a \r\nvariety of sectors, but other challenges are reversing \r\nthe gains we have made in past years, particularly with \r\nthe issues of HIV/AIDS and climate change, which \r\nare among the plethora of challenges that we face as a \r\ndeveloping nation.\r\nThe Kingdom is committed to addressing \r\nthe scourge of climate change. The country fully \r\nparticipated in all the negotiations that culminated \r\nin the adoption and subsequent signing of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. The negative impact \r\nof climate change has become a thorn in the side of \r\nthe eSwatini economy. It has depleted our limited \r\nfinancial resources, killed an alarming number of our \r\nlivestock and destroyed most of our ecosystems. The \r\ndrought has led to a serious reduction in the water \r\nsupply, which is required for crop production, human \r\nuse and consumption, the sustenance of remaining \r\nlivestock and for slowing or stopping the disappearance \r\nof ecosystems. The drought has exacerbated food and \r\nnutrition insecurity for many of our people, not only \r\nin the Kingdom but throughout the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community (SADC) region and across \r\nthe entire African continent. A high proportion of \r\nour economic activity is agro-based. Therefore, the \r\ncountry has continued to feel the harsh effects of \r\nclimate change at the levels of subsistence farming and \r\ncommercial agriculture. It is against that backdrop that \r\nthe Government of the Kingdom of eSwatini declared \r\nthe drought a national disaster.\r\nIntegration has become a universal subject that \r\ntranscends all aspects of life. It has been proved that \r\nany development achieved by individual countries is \r\nthe result of their citizens having deliberately worked \r\ntogether as a collective entity. That is also true with \r\nthe United Nations family, where the basis of all our \r\nsuccess is togetherness and unity in diversity. We have \r\nto come together — in our different sizes and with our \r\ndiverse cultures, traditions, economies and political \r\nand social inclinations — to cooperate and become a \r\nformidable family ready to address any challenge and \r\nachieve any objective we set for ourselves.\r\nIntegration has succeeded in helping nations \r\nwork together for common objectives as regions and \r\ncontinents and as the global community. Many countries \r\nhave succeeded in developing their economies by \r\ncollectively observing common regional rules in order \r\nto promote a regional agenda. Countries have agreed to \r\nopen their markets in order to facilitate a high degree \r\nof economic activity, which, inter alia, boosts trade \r\nand creates jobs. Peaceful societies have been created \r\nthrough integration, which is one of the key ingredients \r\nthat propels the push to transform our world.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini has continued to be an \r\nimportant and active player in promoting regional and \r\ncontinental integration, particularly in the economic \r\nsphere. We are a member of several integration \r\narrangements at the regional level in southern and \r\neastern Africa, as well as at the continental level.\r\nLast month, the Kingdom of eSwatini hosted the \r\nthirty-sixth SADC Summit of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment. The theme of the Summit was “Resource \r\nMobilization for Investment in Sustainable Energy \r\nInfrastructure for an Inclusive SADC Industrialization \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n14/52 16-29811\r\nfor the Prosperity of the Region”. That theme is \r\ncongruous with the theme of the seventy-first session \r\nof the General Assembly and is a building-block that \r\naugments the push to transform our world at the regional \r\nlevel. The Kingdom of eSwatini has been given the task \r\nof leading the SADC for one calendar year, which we \r\naccepted with dignity and humility.\r\nThe SADC Summit theme is in line with all of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, but most particularly \r\nwith Goal 7, which is to “ensure access to affordable, \r\nreliable, sustainable and modern energy for all”, Goal \r\n9, which is to “build resilient infrastructure, promote \r\nsustainable industrialization and foster innovation”, and \r\nGoal 8, which is to “promote inclusive and sustainable \r\neconomic growth, employment and decent work for \r\nall”.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini is also party to a number \r\nof trade integration arrangements, including the \r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa, the \r\nTripartite Free Trade Area, the ongoing negotiations \r\nof the Continental Africa Free Trade Area and the \r\nEconomic Partnership Agreements. Those trade \r\nagreements have opened up preferential market access \r\nopportunities for our country to maximize its trade \r\nat the regional and international levels. Those trade \r\narrangements are also expected to boost the production \r\ncapacity of countries in the region and add value to \r\nprimary products, which will lead to industrialization, \r\njob creation and, subsequently, poverty reduction. In \r\nother words, regional cooperation and integration work \r\nto reinforce the implementation of the SDGs and the \r\npush to transform our world.\r\nOne of the key elements to facilitate the successful \r\nimplementation of the SDGs involves consultation. \r\nSince time immemorial, the Kingdom of Swaziland has \r\ninfused consultation into its way of life. It is a process \r\nthat is appreciated, accepted and embraced by every \r\nmember of the general populace at all levels. It is a \r\nforum made available to all citizens of the country where \r\nthey may literally contribute to the way we address \r\nall economic, social, political and environmental \r\nissues that arise. The Kingdom’s consultation process \r\nis unique. Simple and transparent, it accommodates \r\npeople of all ages, genders, social status, educational \r\nbackgrounds and political inclinations.\r\nIt was only last month that the nation convened \r\nfor days at the Ludzidzini Royal Residence to discuss \r\nissues of national significance. We call that gathering \r\nthe Sibaya, or the People’s Parliament. It is a national \r\nconsultation process that affords every Swazi citizen \r\nan opportunity to contribute to the development of \r\nthe country. Such an inclusive process serves as a \r\nspringboard for the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and provides a push to transforming \r\nour Kingdom, and by extension, our world, in a \r\npeaceful manner.\r\nThe conflict in Syria continues to be a great \r\ncause for concern for us all. We call upon all parties \r\ninvolved to immediately find an amicable solution to \r\nthe impasse. Many lives have been lost, and thousands \r\nof Syrians have become refugees in many parts of the \r\nworld. We therefore urge the United Nations to address \r\nthe problem in order to create suitable living conditions \r\nfor the people of Syria. We furthermore urge those \r\nentrusted with the responsibility of bringing about \r\npeace in Syria not to fight with one another. They \r\nshould instead concentrate their efforts on restoring \r\npeace in the country. They should also speak in one \r\nvoice and adopt a tone and strategy that gives hope to \r\nthe Syrians, who desperately need peace.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini would like to emphasize \r\nthat the push to transform our world will not be \r\neffective or adequate if some individuals, communities, \r\ncountries, regions or continents are left behind. We \r\nmust never forget that every individual has a part to play \r\nin the implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and, subsequently, in the push to transform our \r\nworld. That means that there is a need for universal \r\npartnerships at all stages and levels throughout the \r\nworld. That inclusiveness should also be extended \r\nto Member State representation in all bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAccording to the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nthe Organization’s mission is to reaffirm faith in \r\nfundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of \r\nthe human person and in the equal rights of men and \r\nwomen and of nations large and small. Accordingly, the \r\n23 million people of the Republic of China on Taiwan \r\nshould enjoy the same fundamental rights as any other \r\npeople. Taiwan is mostly unable to attend the meetings \r\nand activities of United Nations specialized agencies. \r\nThus the welfare of its people and, by extension, all \r\nhumankind, is adversely affected. There is no doubt \r\nthat their membership will add value to the family’s \r\nuniversal push to transform our world.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 15/52\r\nBy the same token, my delegation reiterates and \r\nmaintains its call for Africa’s voice to be heard loud and \r\nclear in the Security Council. This appeal has been on \r\nthe agenda for the past 15 years and has been specifically \r\narticulated in the 2005 Ezulwini Consensus adopted by \r\nthe African Union Heads of State and Government. My \r\ndelegation believes that the permanent representation \r\nof the African continent in that United Nations organ \r\ncan contribute tremendously to the implementation of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and to the universal \r\npush to transform our world.\r\nFinally, once again, we wish the United Nations a \r\nprosperous future as it addresses the multiple challenges \r\nthat we are faced with in many parts of the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Swaziland for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Barnabas Sibusiso Dlamini, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Swaziland, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Samiuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva, Prime \r\nMinister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade, Minister for Education and Training of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Trade, Minister for Education and \r\nTraining of the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nMr. Samiuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Minister \r\nfor Education and Training of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Samiuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva, \r\nPrime Minister, Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, \r\nMinister for Education and Training of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Pohiva (Tonga): At the outset, allow me \r\nto echo the sentiments of the many Heads of State, \r\nGovernment and delegation before me in congratulating \r\nMr. Thomson on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session. We are \r\nparticularly humbled, yet proud, that a son of Fiji, \r\nindeed a son of our Pacific islands, has reached the \r\nhistoric milestone of being chosen by the Member \r\nStates of this institution to be their President. He \r\ncan expect the full cooperation and support of the \r\ndelegation of the Kingdom of Tonga. May I also add my \r\nvoice to the cause of previous speakers in thanking his \r\nimmediate predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his \r\noutstanding leadership of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session.\r\nWe welcome the President’s timely and relevant \r\nchoice of theme for this session. The focus of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — and of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development itself — is, \r\nas the theme aptly states, to transform our world and to \r\nensure that no one is left behind. As we delve deeper \r\ninto the implementation of the Agenda over the next \r\nyears towards 2030, the transformation of our world, in \r\nline with the SDGs, can be accomplished, as the theme \r\nstates, only through a universal push. That means \r\nthat all countries and all actors must work together at \r\nnational, regional and international levels in order to \r\nsuccessfully implement the Agenda and achieve our \r\ntargets.\r\nAn important gauge of that success is the extent \r\nof a country’s internalization of the lofty Goals and \r\ntargets that have been set. In November 2015, with \r\nthe assistance of the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme (UNDP), Tonga began incorporating \r\nthe SDGs in its domestic legislation by aligning its \r\nnational strategic development framework with them. \r\nThe SDGs are now an integral part of the Government’s \r\ncorporate-planning and budgeting clauses.\r\nThe health of our people is a top priority for Tonga. \r\nIndeed, we risk losing the most important natural \r\nresource that Tonga has to develop our country if the \r\npeople fall prey to the dangers of non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs). In recognition thereof, and in \r\npartnership with the Pacific Community and the World \r\nHealth Organization, Tonga hosted the first regional \r\nsummit on non-commuicable diseases in June of this \r\nyear in order to highlight the rampant spread of these \r\ndiseases throughout the Kingdom and the Pacific \r\nisland region and to consider action to address the \r\nregional NCD crisis. We were privileged to have as \r\na guest of honour UNDP Administrator Helen Clark, \r\nwhose attendance at the summit was a first for her in \r\nher current role, and which indicated the importance \r\nthat the UNDP, in partnership with Tonga and the \r\nregion, attaches to that health topic. As one of the \r\nleading countries highlighted by the NCDs Joint \r\nProgramming Missions programme and the United \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n16/52 16-29811\r\nNations Interagency Task Force on the Prevention and \r\nControl of NCDs, at a side event this week, Tonga was \r\nrecognized at the international level for its integrated \r\nnational efforts to address NCDs.\r\nRelated to the important issue of health is the \r\nonslaught of transnational crime in our country. With \r\nporous borders, drugs have managed to enter Tonga \r\nthrough the illicit movement of people and goods. \r\nAlthough our country is very small in terms of capital \r\nin comparison with our neighbouring countries, Tonga \r\nhas seen the effect of the drugs trade on the health and \r\nwell-being of our people, particularly our young people, \r\nwhich is putting the future of our country at risk. We \r\nsupport the regional initiatives of the United Nations \r\nOffice on Drugs and Crime to combat the trafficking \r\nin drugs and precursors, among other things, and \r\norganized crime in the Pacific.\r\nAs a small island developing State — in other words, \r\na sea-locked developing country — our traditional \r\nand modern relationship with the ocean places the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of the ocean and its \r\nnatural resources at the forefront of our interests. Tonga \r\njoined the ranks of Member States that argued for the \r\nimportance of the ocean and seas to global sustainable \r\ndevelopment and gradually steered the negotiations \r\non the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nto the inclusion of SDG 14, on the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources \r\nin the Agenda.\r\nWe are now greatly committed to ensuring that \r\nSDG 14, together with its set targets and indicators, is \r\nachieved by 2030. We therefore very much look forward \r\nto the first United Nations Conference to Support the \r\nImplementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, to \r\nbe held in June 2017, as the first global meeting to take \r\nstock of where we stand in terms of the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of our oceans and its resources \r\nand where we need to go to ensure that all targets are \r\nachieved. We thank our friends Fiji and Sweden for \r\npaving the way for the holding of that international \r\nconference. The Assembly can rest assured that Tonga \r\nwill be highly engaged in that process.\r\nWe also commend Italy for its 10x20 Initiative in \r\nline with SDG target 14.5, which seeks to set aside \r\n10 per cent of our coastal waters as marine protected \r\nareas by 2020. We look forward to engaging with and \r\nsupporting the work of the Steering Committee in that \r\nregard, under the able guidance of the co-Chairs, Italy \r\nand Maldives.\r\nTonga continues to recognize the importance \r\nof the work of the International Seabed Authority \r\n(ISA). Tonga engages in the Authority’s processes \r\nto ensure that the appropriate conservation and \r\nenvironmental-management practices are sufficiently \r\nrobust in terms of seabed mining. We thank the \r\nMember States that supported Tonga in its election to \r\nthe Council of the Authority in 2014 and, earlier this \r\nyear, to the Council’s Legal and Technical Commission. \r\nIn reiterating our support for the good work of the ISA \r\nAssembly, we look forward to assisting the Authority \r\nin managing the upcoming challenges as the onset \r\nof seabed mining in the Area comes to the fore. We \r\nalso congratulate the ISA Secretary-General-elect, \r\nMr. Michael Lodge, and look forward to his stewardship \r\nof the Authority in the coming years.\r\nThe regulation of the exportation of biological \r\ndiversity in areas beyond national jurisdictions has yet \r\nto be realized. In line with the decision of the leaders of \r\nthe Pacific Island Forum in 2014, we strongly support \r\nthe ongoing Preparatory Committee meetings process \r\nestablished under the resolution 69/292, of 19 June \r\n2015, which will make substantive recommendations at \r\nthe seventy-second session of the General Assembly for \r\na legally binding instrument on the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction.\r\nWe commend the leadership of the Chairperson \r\nof the Preparatory Committee, Ambassador Eden \r\nCharles of Trinidad and Tobago, and look forward \r\nto his continued stewardship and skilful guidance of \r\nthe process towards its completion through the final \r\ntwo Preparatory Committee meetings next year. The \r\ndraft agreement recognizes the value and importance \r\nof ensuring the integrity of all ecosystems, including \r\noceans, and the protection of biodiversity.\r\nBy partnering with friends, such as the International \r\nUnion for Conservation of Nature, Tonga is able to face \r\nthe challenges of climate change, while remaining fully \r\naware that as a Government it cannot face such challenges \r\nalone. One of those challenges is the existential threat \r\nposed by climate change to international peace and \r\nsecurity. To ensure that the issue of negative impacts of \r\nclimate change is high on the United Nations agenda, \r\nwe reiterate our call for a Special Representative on \r\nclimate and security and for the issue to be raised by \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 17/52\r\nour friends in the Security Council, due to its clear and \r\nunambiguous links to additional threats to international \r\npeace and security. Be it in terms of sea-level rise, \r\nloss of territory, mass migration or as an instigator of \r\nviolence and the suffering of peoples as a result of the \r\nscarcity of resources, the causal link is clear.\r\nTonga is the third-most-vulnerable country in the \r\nworld to the adverse impacts of climate change. As \r\na signatory party to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change and its subsequent \r\nProtocol, Tonga affirms its ongoing commitment to \r\nimplementing the objectives of this core international \r\nframework on climate change. The seriousness of \r\nthe negative impacts of climate change cannot be \r\nunderestimated. Its impacts threaten our territorial \r\nintegrity, land, water, health, infrastructure, \r\nfood security, biological diversity, livelihoods \r\nand ecosystems.\r\nThe maintenance of international peace and security \r\nis determined not solely, but in a major way, by the issue \r\nof disarmament. The proliferation of weapons in all \r\ntheir forms not only threatens international peace and \r\nsecurity, it also demonstrates the sheer waste of financial \r\nresources when Governments invest in the manufacture \r\nand trade in arms. Such finances could be better used \r\nfor international sustainable development initiatives, \r\nwhich would logically contribute to international peace \r\nand security and the betterment of lives. The spending \r\nof trillions of dollars in defence budgets to develop \r\nweapons, including nuclear weapons, at the expense of \r\nthe welfare of one’s people, is offensive and repugnant \r\nto the conscience of humankind.\r\nIn keeping with that sentiment, we wish to express \r\nour concern about the recent nuclear testing by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, in breach \r\nof decisions made by the United Nations to promote \r\ninternational peace and security. Our Pacific islands \r\nand region having experienced the negative effects \r\nof nuclear testing, Tonga believes in the need for \r\ninternational standards to control and manage the use \r\nof nuclear capabilities and nuclear power for peaceful \r\npurposes. For its part, Tonga is at the final stage of its \r\nacceptance process of the statute of the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency, which will formalize its \r\nmembership of the organization. We hope to deposit \r\nour instrument of acceptance with the Agency by the \r\nend of this month.\r\nPart of the challenge of ensuring the credible \r\ndevelopment of all States lies in preventing one country \r\nfrom dominating another country economically. This \r\nmatter bears directly on the right to development, \r\nan issue that we discussed last Thursday morning at \r\nthe high-level segment to commemorate the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of the Declaration on the Right to \r\nDevelopment. The unfair application of such dominance \r\nresults in the suffering of innocent people and, in the \r\nlight of political reasoning, should not be tolerated \r\nin this day and age. We therefore join many others in \r\ncongratulating the Government of the United State \r\non incrementally easing its restrictions on economic \r\nactivity in Cuba. Tonga has an interest in that, given \r\nour concern for the welfare of our nationals currently \r\nliving and studying in Cuba, and also for the millions \r\nof people who merely want an opportunity to enjoy the \r\nright to development. We will again join the majority of \r\nStates represented here this year in calling on the United \r\nStates for a timely lifting of its embargo on Cuba.\r\nWe want to address the welfare of the Pacific people \r\nwho are residents and citizens of West Papua province, \r\nIndonesia. Last year, standing on this same rostrum \r\n(see A/70/PV.18), I spoke about the human rights abuses \r\ntaking place in Indonesian-ruled West Papua. Nothing \r\nappears to have changed there in the year that has \r\nelapsed. I use the word “appears” intentionally, because \r\nwe still have no way of knowing exactly what is going \r\non there. It seems that something is definitely wrong.\r\nNearly half a century ago, when I was still young, I \r\nlearned, as had many others in the region, that a wrong \r\nhad been done to the West Papuans. I am not a young \r\nman now. During much of my life I have struggled,, \r\nagainst great odds for justice and democracy in my \r\nland. In the Christian faith, a universal truism is \r\nespoused through the story of the Good Samaritan. A \r\nbadly injured man lay in the sun by the roadside. He \r\nhad been stripped of his clothing and was evidently \r\nthe victim of a robbery. Without any reservation or \r\nhesitation, free from religious and cultural restrictions \r\nor bias, the Good Samaritan went to help the man, \r\nrelieve his suffering, clothe him and nurse him back to \r\nhealth. The man was placed by the Good Samaritan in \r\nlocal accommodation where he could recover.\r\nThe Tongolese probably have the same neighbourly \r\nconcern for the welfare of the indigenous people of West \r\nPapua. As called for by a decision taken at a meeting \r\nof the Pacific Islands Forum earlier this month in the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia, Tonga supports the goal \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n18/52 16-29811\r\nfor an open and constructive dialogue with Indonesia \r\nwith regard to the status and welfare of the people of \r\nWest Papua. Tonga therefore calls on Indonesia, as a \r\ndialogue partner of the Pacific Islands Forum, to work \r\nwith it and other Forum countries to facilitate this \r\ndecision of our fellow leaders, either bilaterally or \r\nthrough United Nations mechanisms.\r\nFinally, we reiterate our support for the President \r\nand his presidency. We also take this opportunity to \r\npay tribute to the Secretary-General for his tireless \r\nwork on behalf of all countries and peoples, and more \r\nespecially for his sensitivity to the interests of small \r\nisland developing States like my own, for which he has \r\npromoted specific initiatives. His presence here will \r\nsurely be missed. We hope that his successor will carry \r\nforward his work on behalf of small island developing \r\nStates. We wish him well in his future endeavours.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Trade, Minister for Education \r\nand Training of the Kingdom of Tonga, for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Samiuela ‘Akilisi Pohiva, Prime Minister, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Minister \r\nfor Education and Training of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Socialist Republic \r\nof Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh (Viet Nam): I congratulate \r\nMr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session. I am \r\nconfident that his wisdom, leadership and experience \r\nwill guide our session to success. Allow me also to \r\nthank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President at the seventieth \r\nsession, for his important contributions to the work of the \r\nAssembly. My special gratitude extends to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his leadership, commitment, \r\ntireless efforts and tremendous contributions during his \r\nten years at the helm of the Organization.\r\nLast year, 2015, we established a common vision for \r\nthe world we live in. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on \r\nFinancing for Development, the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change and the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction not only seek to address short-term \r\nchallenges, but also to present a vision for greater \r\npartnership for people, the planet, peace and prosperity. \r\nThe theme chosen for this session, “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”, is therefore very opportune as we embark upon \r\nrealizing our vision and turning our commitments into \r\nconcrete results for our people.\r\nI believe that achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) is within our grasp. Our \r\npeople, our children and grandchildren, expect us \r\nto deliver on our commitments. The implementation \r\nof the Millennium Development Goals has laid a \r\nsolid foundation. Opportunities are plenty. Reform, \r\ninnovation, creativity and economic restructuring \r\nare setting countries on a path to prosperity. The \r\ninternationalization of production is making possible \r\nglobal and regional cooperation and integration for \r\nsustainable development. New advances in science and \r\ntechnology are paving the way for the fourth Industrial \r\nRevolution, which promises to bring humanity to a \r\nnew, higher level of development.\r\nBut challenges are by no means few. Developing \r\ncountries in particular continue to suffer from the \r\nweak global economic recovery, rising protectionism in \r\nmajor economies, climate change, natural disasters and \r\nepidemics. Food and water security, the depletion of \r\nnatural resources, and the humanitarian and migration \r\ncrises also have negative and far-reaching implications \r\nfor many countries and regions. Development and \r\nincome gaps are widening at the national, regional and \r\nglobal levels. The instability and tension, violence, \r\nconflicts, terrorism and violent extremism that are \r\nplaguing many regions are of particular concern. \r\nPower politics and the use, or threat of use, of force \r\nin international relations continue to be a threat to \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nThat is the reality of our world today, and it compels \r\nus to work together to promote multilateralism and \r\nadherence to international law for peace, cooperation \r\nand sustainable development. As has been demonstrated, \r\nmultilateral cooperation has a growing role to play \r\nin international relations. We are seeing multilateral \r\ninstitutions expand, both in numbers and in strength. \r\nMulti-tiered cooperation and integration are taking \r\nshape. Multilateral solutions to common challenges \r\nprove to be the most effective and long-lasting, since \r\nno country, large or small, rich or poor, can afford to \r\naddress those challenges alone. Multilateral institutions \r\nare also venues for countries to promote their interests, \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 19/52\r\neffectively manage disputes and differences and expand \r\ntheir development opportunities.\r\nThat is why Viet Nam believes that multilateralism \r\nmust be strengthened and the operation of multilateral \r\ninstitutions, particularly the United Nations, must be \r\nimproved. The United Nations has an indispensable \r\nrole to play by coordinating international responses \r\nto global challenges and facilitating development \r\ncooperation. No other organization is better at fostering \r\npartnerships and assisting countries to successfully \r\nimplement the SDGs.\r\nAccordingly, to ensure greater equality, democracy \r\nand transparency, the United Nations, including the \r\nSecurity Council, must undergo reform. The United \r\nNations development system must have better resources \r\nand be more effective and efficient. We must ensure the \r\nbroadest participation of all countries in discussions \r\nand formulations of resolutions and decisions, so that \r\nno country will be left behind.\r\nInternational law remains the linchpin of a stable \r\ninternational security architecture and a strong \r\nmultilateral system. Unfortunately, the role of the \r\nfundamental norms and principles of international law is \r\nunderestimated. Unfair demands, unilateralism, power \r\npolitics and the use of force to address international \r\nsecurity and political issues have been creating tensions \r\nand confrontation, hindering efforts to peacefully settle \r\ndisputes and conflicts.\r\nThis is where the United Nations can and must \r\nplay a stronger part. The Organization must take the \r\nlead in promoting adherence to international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations as the foundation for \r\ninternational peace and security. No country, big or \r\nsmall, can be exempt from the law. The United Nations \r\nshould also work to strengthen preventive diplomacy \r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes, utilizing all \r\ntools, as provided in Article 33 of the Charter.\r\nAbove all, I believe that each country should align \r\nits national interests with those of humankind and \r\nimmerse itself in the community of nations. A policy \r\nof humanity, peace and friendship will enable us to \r\neliminate hatred, narrow gaps, manage differences and \r\nopen up opportunities to find lasting solutions to all \r\ndisputes and conflicts. Having suffered from decades \r\nof war, Viet Nam treasures peace and will spare no \r\neffort to maintain or achieve peace. We believe lasting \r\npeace can be secured only by long-term vision and a \r\ncomprehensive and inclusive approach that harmonizes \r\nthe interests of all stakeholders. We welcome recent \r\npositive developments in the relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States and support resolutions on ending \r\nthe economic embargo against Cuba.\r\nMultilateralism, international law, peace, \r\ncooperation and development are the key elements \r\nfor building a peaceful, stable and prosperous Asia-\r\nPacific region. Regional countries are working to \r\npromote initiatives for political, economic, social and \r\ncultural cooperation and integration, including new-\r\ngeneration free trade areas. However, the Asia-Pacific \r\nregion contains risks of conflict, especially on the \r\nKorean peninsula and in the South China Sea — all and \r\nany of which can threaten regional and international \r\npeace, security and prosperity. With regard to certain \r\nrecent complicated developments in the South China \r\nSea, we call upon all parties concerned to exercise \r\nself-restraint and solve disputes by peaceful means in \r\naccordance with international law, including the 1982 \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, fully \r\nrespect diplomatic and legal processes, implement the \r\nDeclaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South \r\nChina Sea and expedite the completion of the code of \r\nconduct for the South China Sea.\r\nViet Nam is strongly committed to the SDGs \r\nand the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nA plan of action for the implementation of the SDGs \r\nhas been developed, and we are working with United \r\nNations agencies to craft the strategic plan 2017-2021, \r\nas part of the Delivering as One initiative, to assist \r\nViet Nam in the implementation of the SDGs. For us, \r\nimplementing the SDGs is part of and also encompasses \r\nour efforts to restructure the economy and transform \r\nthe growth model, develop sustainable infrastructure, \r\nensure social justice, address inequalities and protect \r\nthe environment. As one of the countries predicted \r\nto be hardest hit by climate change and sea-level \r\nrise, Viet Nam is expediting procedures for the early \r\nratification of the Paris Agreement and is planning \r\nits implementation.\r\nExperience has shown that success comes only \r\nwhen we take our development into our own hands. To \r\ntransform the world, we must start with transforming \r\nourselves and leave no one behind. Viet Nam believes \r\nit essential to bring its domestic resources into full play \r\nand mainstream sustainability into our development \r\nvision, strategies and policies, with the people at the \r\ncentre. We also believe that we can succeed only with \r\nstronger global partnerships, in which the United \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n20/52 16-29811\r\nNations plays the convening and coordinating role. \r\nViet Nam calls on developed countries to uphold their \r\nresponsibility to take the lead in assisting developing \r\ncountries, including Viet Nam, to realize the SDGs, \r\nespecially in financing, capacity-building, technology \r\ntransfer and trade facilitation.\r\nAs a peace-loving and friendly nation, Viet Nam \r\nalways pursues the foreign policy of independence, \r\nself-reliance, peace, cooperation and development. We \r\nstrive to be a friend, a reliable partner and a responsible \r\nmember of the international community. Our \r\ncommitment to multilateralism and international law is \r\nunwavering, and we will spare no effort to contribute to \r\npeace, cooperation and development. \r\nViet Nam has decided to present its candidacy for \r\nnon-permanent membership of the Security Council \r\nfor the term 2020-2021 and will continue to increase \r\nits participation in the United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations. Viet Nam looks forward to stronger \r\npartnership and collaboration with the United Nations \r\nand Member States to realize the vision of transforming \r\nour world and ensuring a better future.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Walid Al-Moualem, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Expatriates of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Moualem (Syria) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\nwould like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson and his \r\nfriendly country, Fiji, on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish \r\nhim every success during his presidency, which he has \r\npromised would be one for the whole Assembly. Such \r\na promise, if kept, would strengthen the neutral role of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly and shed a bright \r\nlight on facts that some are trying to conceal.\r\nAs we meet once again, our world is going through a \r\ngrave and dangerous period. Terrorism, which we have \r\ncautioned against repeatedly from this very rostrum, \r\nhas continued to grow and gain ground, claiming the \r\nlives of more innocent people and causing death and \r\ndestruction as it rages unabated across the world. The \r\nblood of Syrians was not enough to quench its thirst. \r\nIt had to go after the citizens of many other countries, \r\nincluding those that have supported and sponsored it. \r\nThese innocent people are now paying for the mistakes \r\nof their Governments, which have ignored the interests \r\nof their people and adopted short-sighted policies.\r\nFor more than five years, the Syrian people — no \r\nmatter their affiliations — have paid dearly for the \r\ncrimes of terrorists who have shed their blood and \r\nundermined their security, stability and livelihoods.\r\nTerrorism has spared no one, even targeting schools \r\nand universities, hospitals, places of worship and \r\ninfrastructure. Everyone knows that terrorism would \r\nnot have spread through my country if it had not been \r\nfor the external support of certain countries. As is no \r\nlonger a secret, these have included Qatar and Saudi \r\nArabia, which have promoted their jihadist takfiri \r\nideology and their death fatwas that have nothing to \r\ndo with Islam. They have bragged about supporting \r\nterrorism in every way possible, sending into Syria \r\nthousands of mercenaries equipped with the most \r\nsophisticated weapons.\r\nMeanwhile, Turkey has opened its border to admit \r\ntens of thousands of terrorists from around the world and \r\nhas provided them with logistical support and training \r\ncamps under the supervision of Turkish and Western \r\nintelligence. It has even supplied those terrorists with \r\ndirect military support, as was the case in Idlib, Aleppo \r\nand rural Latakia. I would like to refer the Assembly \r\nto a study published seven months ago by a German \r\ninstitute, the Firil Center For Studies. According to that \r\nstudy, more than 360,000 foreign terrorists from 83 \r\ncountries have entered Syria since April 2011. By the \r\nend of 2015, the Syrian Army was able to kill 95,000 \r\nof them, while 120,000 returned home or travelled to \r\nother countries.\r\nIn Syria, we are combating terrorism on behalf \r\nof the entire world. Every time the Syrian Army kills \r\nanother foreign terrorist, it spares the lives of the \r\ninnocent people who could have died in terrorist acts \r\ncommitted by that same terrorist upon his return to his \r\nnative country. Anyone who tries to distort that fact \r\nmust be held responsible for the spread of terrorism and \r\nthe increasing numbers of victims. Our valiant Army \r\ndeserves to be commended and supported. It must \r\nnever be the target of schemes and lies.\r\nThe terrorist campaign against my country is \r\ntaking place in the full view of a polarized world. There \r\nare those who have chosen to support international \r\nlaw and the principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, while others have decided to turn a blind eye \r\nto the truth and to support, finance and arm terrorists \r\nunder false pretexts that depart from logic and reason. \r\nThey choose, for example, to refer to those terrorists \r\nas moderate armed opposition, even though there is \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 21/52\r\nirrefutable evidence that the groups have committed \r\nagainst Syrians crimes and massacres that are no \r\nless barbaric than those of Da’esh or A1-Qaida. Some \r\nconsider people who take up arms against the State \r\nand its citizens legitimate opposition as long as they \r\nare located in Syria, while the same people, on any \r\nother day and in another country, would be considered \r\nterrorists, or at least outlaws.\r\nThese facts notwithstanding, all Syrians — the \r\npeople, the Army and the Government — will not \r\nrelent in their fight against terrorism. They are more \r\ndetermined than ever before to eliminate terrorism \r\nwherever it exists in their country and to rebuild a better \r\nSyria, because they are well aware that their homeland \r\nwill cease to exist if the terrorists and their backers \r\nemerge victorious. Our belief in victory is even greater \r\nnow that the Syrian Army is making considerable \r\nstrides in its war against terrorism, with the support \r\nof the true friends of the Syrian people, notably the \r\nRussian Federation, Iran and the Lebanese national \r\nresistance. Such support has helped to strengthen the \r\nresilience of Syrians and to alleviate their suffering. We \r\ntruly hope that other countries will soon wake up and \r\nrealize, before it is too late, the danger that threatens \r\nus all.\r\nWe have always welcomed all international efforts \r\nto counter terrorism in Syria, but we stress once again \r\nthe need to coordinate such efforts with the Government \r\nof the Syrian Arab Republic and the Syrian Arab Army \r\nthat has been combating terrorism on the ground for \r\nmore than five years. Without such coordination, any \r\naction would be considered a breach of sovereignty, a \r\nf lagrant interference and a violation of the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter. Without such coordination, \r\nany action will fall short of achieving real results and \r\nwill even make matters worse.\r\nIn that regard, the Syrian Government condemns \r\nin the strongest possible terms the attack launched \r\nby American warplanes on a Syrian Army site in the \r\nvicinity of the Deir ez-Zor airport on 17 September. \r\nThat attack allowed ISIL to gain control of the site. \r\nThe Syrian Government holds the United States fully \r\nresponsible for that aggression, because facts show \r\nthat it was an intentional attack, and not an error, even \r\nif the United States claims otherwise. This cowardly \r\naggression clearly proves that the United States and \r\nits allies are complicit with Da’esh and other terrorist \r\narmed organizations.\r\nWe also reiterate our condemnation of the Turkish \r\nincursion into Syrian territories under the pretext of \r\ncountering terrorism. That f lagrant aggression must \r\nbe stopped immediately. Terrorism cannot be fought \r\nby replacing one terrorist organization with another. \r\nOne cannot but wonder how a State that has been the \r\nmain entry point for terrorists and weapons into Syria \r\ncan claim to be fighting terrorism. How can there be \r\ngenuine and effective international counter-terrorism \r\ncooperation while relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nremain dead letters?\r\nSince the onset of the crisis in 2011, the Syrian \r\nGovernment has declared that any solution must follow \r\ntwo parallel tracks: a counter-terrorism track, and a \r\npolitical track through an intra-Syrian dialogue that \r\nallows Syrians to determine the future of their country \r\nwithout foreign interference. All solutions dictated \r\nfrom the outside are categorically rejected by the Syrian \r\npeople. Likewise, no political solution will succeed \r\nunless the necessary foundations and conditions for its \r\nimplementation have been laid, including intensified \r\ncounter-terrorism efforts and progress in the national \r\nreconciliation process — a strategy which has proved \r\nsuccessful in a number of areas around Syria.\r\nDespite all the hurdles created by the regional and \r\nWestern States that have sided with the self-proclaimed \r\nSyrian opposition, we have always been open to a \r\npolitical track that would stem the bloodshed and end \r\nthe prolonged suffering of Syrians. We reiterate our \r\ncommitment to moving forward on the Geneva track, \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. We recall \r\nour constructive position with regard to the political \r\nsolution. Such a solution must be based on respect \r\nfor the sovereignty, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity of Syria and the unity of its people. It should \r\nbegin by establishing a government of national unity \r\ncomprising representatives from the Government and \r\nthe opposition, in all its factions, and tasked with \r\nestablishing a constitution-drafting committee. Once \r\nthe new Constitution had been approved by Syrians \r\nthrough a referendum, parliamentary elections would \r\nfollow and the new Government would be formed under \r\nthe new Constitution.\r\nIt is truly regrettable that some are exploiting \r\nthe humanitarian tragedy and suffering of Syrians, \r\nespecially in terrorist-held areas, and politicizing such \r\nsuffering to achieve certain goals that have nothing to \r\ndo with humanitarian principles or the interests of the \r\nSyrians themselves. Some countries continue to shed \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n22/52 16-29811\r\ncrocodile tears over the situation of the Syrians in some \r\nareas, accusing the Syrian Government of employing a \r\npolicy of sieges and starvation. At the same time, the \r\nsame countries continue to support and arm the terrorists \r\nwho are besieging civilians in the same areas, from the \r\ninside, using them as human shields and preventing the \r\ndelivery of or confiscating humanitarian aid.\r\nMake no mistake — no one is more committed than \r\nthe Syrian Government to ending the suffering of the \r\nSyrian people and providing them with a life of dignity, \r\nwherever they may be and without exception. That is \r\na duty and not a favour. We will spare no effort to that \r\nend, including in cooperation with the United Nations, \r\ndespite all the difficulties that we are facing as a result \r\nof the systematic destruction by externally supported \r\nterrorist organizations, and despite the unilateral \r\ncoercive economic and financial measures imposed on \r\nthe Syrian people by the very parties that falsely claim \r\nto have the interests of the Syrian people in mind. Such \r\nunilateral measures have adversely affected many vital \r\nsectors, including health care, education and energy.\r\nToday, while Syria is confronting mercenary \r\nterrorists on its territory, it has long confronted a \r\ndifferent kind of terrorism — the terrorism of Israel, \r\nwhich has occupied a precious part of its land in the \r\nSyrian Golan since 4 June 1967. Our Syrian Arab \r\npeople in the occupied Golan continue to suffer as a \r\nresult of Israel’s oppressive and aggressive practices. \r\nThose practices are no longer confined to the occupied \r\nGolan but are currently affecting the security and life \r\nof Syrians in the southern part of the country. Israel \r\nis directly intervening militarily to assist the terrorist \r\norganizations operating in the area in every way. Syria \r\ncalls on the international community to put an effective \r\nend to all such practices and compel Israel to implement \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions, particularly \r\nSecurity Council resolution 497 (1981) on the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan. \r\nThe United Nations should also compel Israel to \r\nallow the Palestinian people to enjoy their inalienable \r\nrights, including the establishment of their own \r\nindependent State, with Jerusalem as its capital, and \r\nthe return of Palestinian refugees to their land, in \r\naccordance with internationally recognized resolutions.\r\nSyria reaffirms that Israel’s aggressive policies \r\nthreaten not only Syria, but the region in general, \r\nespecially given Israel’s nuclear arsenal. We have \r\nstressed time and again the need to compel Israel to join \r\nthe Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons \r\nand other treaties on weapons of mass destructon \r\n(WMDs) and to subject its nuclear installations to the \r\noversight of the International Atomic Energy Agency.\r\nSyria stresses the right of States to use nuclear \r\ntechnology for peaceful purposes. We have always \r\ncalled for creating a WMD-free zone in the Middle East. \r\nIn fact, we have efficiently and responsibly eliminated \r\nall chemical weapons in Syria, in cooperation with the \r\nJoint Mission of the Organization for the Prohibition \r\nof Chemical Weapons and the United Nations. In that \r\nregard, Syria reiterates its readiness to continue its \r\ncooperation with the Joint Investigative Mechanism, as \r\nwell as to continue the relevant Syrian investigations.\r\nWe congratulate Cuba and Iran on reaching \r\nagreements to lift the embargoes imposed on them, and \r\nwe look forward to their implementation. We renew \r\nour call for removing the illegal economic measures \r\nimposed on the Syrian people and other independent \r\npeoples in the world, notably the peoples of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of Korea, Venezuela and Belarus.\r\nIn closing, we wish Member States and their peoples \r\nlasting security and prosperity. We hope that our \r\nOrganization will be able to regain public trust around \r\nthe world by upholding the provisions of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, which calls for respecting the \r\nsovereignty and independence of Member States and \r\nensuring non-interference in their internal affairs. That \r\nprinciple, if implemented, would lay the foundations for \r\ngenuine and fair relations among nations after the greed \r\nand arrogance of some have shaken them to their core.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, Deputy Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Home Affairs of Malaysia.\r\nMr. Hamidi (Malaysia): Allow me at the outset \r\nto congratulate His Excellency Peter Thomson on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session. I also wish to express my \r\ndelegation’s deepest appreciation to His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session, for his leadership \r\nand able stewardship.\r\nMalaysia is committed to the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and its Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). For Malaysia, the nation’s \r\ndevelopment agenda has always been people-centred, \r\nwhich runs parallel to the aspirations of the SDGs. I \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 23/52\r\nam pleased to state here that Malaysia has set in motion \r\ninitiatives and actions to achieve the 2030 Agenda. Our \r\ncurrent five-year development plan — the eleventh \r\nMalaysia plan, covering the period from 2016 to \r\n2020 — was formulated with people at the centre of \r\nall development efforts and with the theme “Anchoring \r\ngrowth on people”.\r\nThe plan embraces three main principles: achieving \r\nhigh income, inclusiveness and sustainability. In many \r\nof its aspects, the plan mirrors the multidimensional \r\nnature of the 2030 Agenda. As the 2030 Agenda is \r\nimplemented, the SDGs will be integrated into the \r\nnational framework of the plan. Malaysia is also in \r\nthe process of formulating a national SDG road map, \r\nestablishing a broad-based and inclusive committee \r\nto oversee the implementation and monitoring of the \r\nSDGs and strengthening the data requirements for \r\nthem. That road map will serve as an overarching and \r\nguiding policy for Malaysia’s sustainable development.\r\nIn the meantime, every effort is being made to \r\nensure that the initiatives outlined in the eleventh \r\nMalaysia plan are duly implemented. They include a \r\ntechnical and vocational education training (TVET) \r\ncomponent. By providing essential skills through TVET \r\nprogrammes, we are not only preparing the youth for \r\nthe labour market, but also preparing human capital for \r\nnation-building. Graduates of our TVET programmes, \r\nwhich involve cooperation between the National Youth \r\nSkills Institute and various multinational companies, \r\nhave a 90 per cent employability rate.\r\nNext, I want to talk about our very own magic, or \r\nMalaysian Global Innovation and Creativity Centre \r\n(MaGIC), which will work to make Malaysia the \r\nstartup capital of Asia. Our mission is to catalyse the \r\nentrepreneurial ecosystem in Malaysia by bringing \r\ntogether the abundant resources of partners and \r\ncommunities alike in order to develop entrepreneurs \r\nthat will start enduring and high-growth companies, \r\nthereby exerting a positive impact at the regional and \r\nglobal levels. MaGIC, which is located in Cyberjaya, \r\nMalaysia, was jointly launched by the President of the \r\nUnited States of America, Mr. Barack Obama, and our \r\nPrime Minister, Mr. Najib Tun Razak, in April 2014. \r\nOn that memorable day, MaGIC signed a memorandum \r\nof understanding with UP Global to further foster and \r\ndevelop a vibrant ecosystem for startup companies in \r\nMalaysia and beyond.\r\nIn Malaysia, we no longer work in silos. We \r\nhave moved into a new working environment that \r\nwe call the “blue ocean” and have bid farewell to the \r\narchaic “red ocean”. We have introduced a unique \r\nnational development strategy based on creativity and \r\ninnovation known as the National Blue Ocean Strategy \r\n(NBOS). It is a strategy in which over 80 ministries and \r\nagencies — from the police and military, to women, \r\nyouth and higher education organizations — are \r\ncollaborating to formulate and execute creative NBOS \r\ninitiatives that are transforming the country. The unique \r\nStrategy also involves public and private partnership. \r\nNBOS gave birth to our unique urban transformation \r\ncentres and rural transformation centres. One only \r\nneeds to go to either centre for all Government services.\r\nMalaysia is also no stranger in the area of \r\nvolunteerism. I am referring to our very own \r\norganization of Malaysian-based Hospitals Beyond \r\nBoundaries (HBB), as well as to other voluntary \r\norganizations and non-governmental organizations. \r\nHBB is a non-profit organization that is committed to \r\nproviding accessible health care through community-\r\nrun clinics in underprivileged communities in \r\nCambodia and Malaysia. HBB is led by a recipient of \r\nthe United Nations Young Leader Award, Dr. Mohd \r\nLutfi Fadil Lokman, who was selected under SDG 3, \r\n“Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at \r\nall ages”.\r\nWe have heard testimonies from various small \r\nisland developing States on the devastating impact of \r\nclimate change on their countries and populations and \r\nthe existential threat it presents to their subsistence. We \r\nhave seen an increase in the frequency and intensity \r\nof climate-related disasters, such as f loods, coastal \r\nerosion and landslides, in many other countries across \r\nthe globe.\r\nSuch extreme weather events have affected \r\neconomic activities and the livelihoods and safety of \r\npeople. If left unchecked, I am afraid climate change \r\ncould, in fact, constitute the greatest threat multiplier \r\nfor global security. Realizing the increasingly urgent \r\nneed to address the impact of climate change, we came \r\ntogether in Paris last December and took the historic \r\nstep of adopting the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. We must now follow through and carry out \r\nthe commitments assumed thereunder. Malaysia is \r\ncommitted to reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas \r\nemissions of its gross domestic product by up to 45 per \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n24/52 16-29811\r\ncent by 2030. Malaysia is currently working towards its \r\nratification of the Paris Agreement.\r\nAn international environment that enables peace \r\nand security is also important for the successful \r\nimplementation of the SDGs. Yet we are witnessing \r\nvarious conflicts in several parts of the world. The \r\nrise in the phenomenon of non-State actors such as \r\nDa’esh, Boko Haram and Al-Shabaab has caused the \r\ninstability and insecurity of nations. The international \r\ncommunity continues to witness horrific acts of cruelty \r\nby these non-State actors. They employ terror tactics \r\nand extremism as ways of spreading their influence \r\nand reach.\r\nThe fight against terrorism cannot be won \r\nthrough force or punitive measures alone. Malaysia \r\nhas established deradicalization and rehabilitation \r\nprogrammes that are oriented towards changing the \r\nmindsets of radicalized extremist individuals. The \r\nprogrammes are complemented by various forms of \r\nhumanitarian assistance to facilitate the reintegration \r\nof those individuals into society. Such measures are \r\nimportant to avoid relapse. The success rate of our \r\nderadicalization programme thus far is around 97.5 per \r\ncent. Malaysia has come up with a deradicalization \r\nmodule and a standard operation procedure, which we \r\nstand ready to share with other nations.\r\nNo nation is immune to the threat of international \r\nterrorism. Hence, there is an urgent need to address \r\nterrorism comprehensively. We need to counter it from \r\nan ideological perspective by addressing the narratives \r\nand root causes of terrorism and exploring how \r\nthey could be used to attract people into supporting \r\nterrorist groups. We need to explore new solutions \r\nand continuously work to enhance our domestic legal \r\nframework in the fight against violent extremism. The \r\ncontinuous efforts should involve a diverse cross section \r\nof our population. We should enhance our interactions \r\nby winning the hearts and minds of religious leaders, \r\nwomen and our youth. We should build networks at \r\nall levels of society where they can help by providing \r\ncounter-narratives and counter-messaging through \r\ncommunity-based efforts — the arts, media, sports, \r\nand culture.\r\nToday, we are still grappling with the problem \r\nof determining and identifying the root causes of \r\nterrorism. Many people speculate that those root causes \r\ncould be poverty, deprivation, alienation, suppression \r\nor any of myriad other factors. Malaysia therefore joins \r\nothers in calling for robust and effective international \r\naction in our collective fight against terrorism. Such \r\naction must be based on full respect for the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and for universally recognized \r\nprinciples of law, including international humanitarian \r\nlaw and international human rights law. Only if and \r\nwhen the international community stands united can \r\nthe terrorists be defeated.\r\n Seven decades after the inception of the United \r\nNations, the question of Palestine remains unresolved. \r\nThe protracted crisis highlights the inherent f laws in \r\nthe workings of the United Nations, where the use of \r\nthe veto continues to perpetuate the longest occupation \r\nin modern history. Over the years, the situation on the \r\nground in the occupied Palestinian territory is slowly \r\nbut surely moving away from a two-State solution. \r\nThe blockade on Gaza by the occupying Power, the \r\nunrelenting expansion of illegal Israeli settlements, \r\nthe continued construction of illegal walls, the forced \r\ntransfer of Palestinians from their homes and the gross \r\nviolations of their human rights continue unabated \r\ndespite mounting international pressure and criticism.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to highlight \r\nthe lingering problem pertaining to the resettlement \r\nof existing refugee populations in host countries to \r\nthird countries. Lengthy delays in the resettlement \r\nof refugees inevitably result in economic, social, \r\npolitical and security hardships for the host country. \r\nWe therefore urge the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees, the International \r\nOrganization for Migration and the States parties to \r\nthe 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees \r\nand its related Protocol to address this matter and act \r\npromptly on it. While we are cognizant of the elements \r\ncontained in the New York Declaration for Refugees \r\nand Migrants (resolution 71/1), we emphasize that no \r\ninitiative should place a State that is not a signatory to \r\nthe relevant international instruments in a position that \r\nis inconsistent with the provisions of the 1969 Vienna \r\nConvention on the Law of Treaties.\r\nMalaysia’s robust, rapid development and economic \r\ngrowth have attracted people throughout our region, by \r\nboth legal and illegal means, who seek better living \r\nconditions and greater employment opportunities. These \r\nare the main drivers of migration within the South-East \r\nAsia region. Malaysia recognizes the contributions \r\nof the foreign workers to its economic prosperity and \r\nconsiders it equally important to protect their safety \r\nand welfare. Accordingly, the Government of Malaysia \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 25/52\r\npays attention to cases involving labour exploitation, \r\nincluding forced labour, and the definition of trafficking \r\nin persons under the Malaysian Anti-Trafficking in \r\nPersons and Anti-Smuggling of Migrants Act 2007 \r\nhas been broadened to include labour exploitation. \r\nThis is in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which requires immediate and stern \r\nmeasures to eradicate forced labour, modern slavery \r\nand human trafficking. Malaysia works in concert with \r\nthe international community to tackle and eliminate \r\nthose heinous crimes, which have caused grave injustice \r\nas well as untold suffering.\r\nMalaysia joins the other Member States in \r\nexpressing its profound gratitude to His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon for his able leadership as Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the world body since 2007. It is our fervent \r\nhope that the incoming Secretary-General will have \r\nstrong leadership traits, a transformative vision of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil, and the ability to address the present and \r\nemerging challenges that threaten international peace, \r\nsecurity, development and human rights.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Mr. Pasquale \r\nValentini, Minister for Foreign and Political Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of San Marino.\r\nMr. Valentini (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf \r\nof the Government of San Marino, I would like to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at the \r\nseventy-first session. We wish him a fruitful session, \r\nand the San Marino delegation assures the President of \r\nits full cooperation throughout the work of the General \r\nAssembly. I would also like to express my country’s \r\ngratitude to the outgoing President, His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, for the work he did during the \r\nseventieth session.\r\nAt the end of the last year of his second term as \r\nSecretary-General, my country extends its special \r\nthanks to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-Moon for the \r\nenergy and determination with which he has led the \r\nUnited Nations, and for the sensitivity he has shown \r\ntowards all Member States without distinction.\r\nThe theme chosen for this session, “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”, offers an interesting opportunity to make a \r\nconstructive contribution to the work of the Assembly. \r\nThe United Nations today faces challenges whose \r\nlevel of complexity and degree of interrelatedness \r\nare unparalleled in its history. The Organization must \r\nadapt quickly to new global challenges but also to the \r\nnew opportunities offered by globalization in order \r\nto be more effective in carrying out its mandate. At \r\nthe same time, the very complexity of these global \r\nchallenges, which cannot be solved by any single State \r\nalone, unequivocally reaffirms the value and central \r\nrole of the United Nations as a forum for solving global \r\nproblems. In this context, the determination shown by \r\nthe Secretary-General in submitting a proposal to the \r\nOrganization for adaptation and requesting similar \r\nadaptation from Member States must be highlighted. \r\nThis is why many of the initiatives undertaken have \r\nyielded significant results during his mandate.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in September 2015 in the presence of \r\nmany Heads of State and Government  including Their \r\nExcellencies the Captains Regent of the Republic of \r\nSan Marino  was one of the most important moments \r\nin the history of the United Nations. This ambitious \r\nAgenda integrates the three dimensions of sustainable \r\ndevelopment — economic, social and environmental. \r\nAs an expression of a strong political consensus on \r\nthe approach to sustainable global and innovative \r\ndevelopment, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment defines our future and the vision of the \r\nworld we want to live in. The transformation process \r\nfor a new model of sustainable development is now \r\nunder way.\r\nOur country appreciates the commitment shown \r\nby Member States to the reduction of carbon dioxide \r\nemissions by 2020. Our country also attaches great \r\nimportance to the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and \r\nto the monitoring mechanism identified in the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development. The \r\nreal challenge today lies in the firmness of our will to \r\neffectively implement this vision. This is the response \r\nthat the peoples we represent in this forum expect from \r\nus: that our Organization fulfil its mandate of protecting \r\nthe citizens of the world and that Member States resume \r\ntheir responsibilities without letting national interests \r\nprevail over the ideals of solidarity and respect for the \r\nuniversal rights of every human being. Any hesitation \r\nin doing so will inevitably exact a very heavy toll in \r\nterms of destruction and loss of human lives.\r\nOver the past few years, we have unfortunately \r\nwitnessed a series of events that constitute a very \r\nserious threat to international peace and security and \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n26/52 16-29811\r\ntherefore are an obstacle to the complete fulfilment \r\nof our mandate. We are facing the persistence of wars \r\nthat have caused an unprecedented global humanitarian \r\ncrisis, an increase in terrorism and violent extremism, \r\nthe tragedy of the large movements of migrants and \r\nrefugees, and a rise in populism and intolerance.\r\nThe conflict in Syria, which has continued \r\nuninterrupted since March 2011, has already caused \r\nmore than 270,000 deaths, of which over 13,000 are \r\nchildren and more than 8,000 women. In addition, \r\nhundreds of thousands of people have been wounded. \r\nInevitably, the humanitarian situation in Syria has \r\ndrastically deteriorated. Most of those who need primary \r\ncare, in particular women and children, live in besieged \r\nareas that cannot be reached by humanitarian convoys.\r\nIn five years, the Syrian conflict has caused \r\n4.8 million people to become refugees in neighbouring \r\ncountries — hundreds of thousands in Europe — and \r\n6.6 million displaced people inside Syria itself, out \r\nof a population of over 20 million people before the \r\nwar. More than 130 million people worldwide need \r\nhumanitarian assistance as a result of armed conflicts \r\nand natural disasters. In Syria, for example, more than \r\n13 million people need humanitarian assistance because \r\nof the war. In Yemen, there are more than 20 million \r\nwho require assistance.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino has always strongly \r\ncondemned all violations of human rights and \r\ninternational humanitarian laws perpetrated in Syria by \r\nall parties to the conflict, without any distinction. These \r\nare violations that are unfortunately still occurring \r\ntoday as we gather to affirm our commitment to peace \r\nand security. San Marino supports the action of the \r\nSecretary-General in Syria through his Special Envoy \r\nand expresses its appreciation for the work carried \r\nout there.\r\nSan Marino is well aware of the extreme \r\nseriousness of the world situation and of the need for \r\neach international stakeholder to play its part. In recent \r\nmonths it has contributed concretely to addressing the \r\npresent humanitarian emergency. Besides contributing \r\nfinancially to various international programmes, \r\nSan Marino has joined the Humanitarian Corridors \r\nproject promoted by the Community of Sant’Egidio, \r\nthe Federation of Evangelical Churches in Italy and the \r\nWaldensian Table, supported by the Italian Ministry of \r\nForeign Affairs, and has hosted some migrants in the \r\nRepublic of San Marino — a small contribution from a \r\nmicro-State with great determination.\r\nIt is therefore necessary to have a united approach \r\nthat combines the long-term perspective embodied \r\nin the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) with a \r\nshort-term focus that makes it possible for us to address \r\nthe emergencies that are evident to all. This united \r\napproach can only result from a significant cultural \r\nchange based on the awareness of belonging to one \r\nhuman family and recognizing, as a consequence, the \r\nculture of understanding and of peaceful coexistence \r\namong different peoples and cultures as the only way to \r\nface the challenges of globalization without excluding \r\nanyone. Indeed, working together is the only way to \r\nbuild a planet for all.\r\nWith a view to fulfilling that mandate, we wish to \r\nexpress our heartfelt thanks to the Secretary-General for \r\nhaving placed the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights at the core of his agenda. Today, we can say that \r\nthis is a cross-cutting issue and that human rights are \r\nreflected in every action of the United Nations aimed \r\nat achieving peace, security, justice and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Only once we fully recognize and share \r\nthe sense of the inalienable value of the person, in \r\nwhatever condition or stage of life, will the cultural and \r\nreligious differences and the many traditions within \r\nour Organization be seen not as obstacles to possible \r\nsolutions but rather as valuable resources that make \r\nit possible to harmonize the diverse interests of the \r\ninternational community. In this regard, promoting \r\nfull respect for individuals is not just one of the many \r\ngoals but, on the contrary, the foundation upon which \r\nall our actions must be based in order to eliminate \r\npoverty, share prosperity, offer decent work to all and, \r\nultimately, protect our planet.\r\nThe work of the United Nations and its specialized \r\nagencies contributes to affirming the culture of \r\nrespect for fundamental rights, mutual knowledge \r\nand understanding, tolerance and hospitality. This is \r\nthe culture that we, the States Members of the United \r\nNations, must strive to disseminate among our citizens, \r\nstarting with our young people, because it is only by \r\naffirming those values that the objectives set out by our \r\nOrganization will be achieved.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino, in accordance with its \r\nhistory and tradition of freedom and democracy, firmly \r\nbelieves in that mandate and will support any action \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 27/52\r\nthat helps strengthen the United Nations as it strives to \r\nfulfil it.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Aurelia Frick, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister \r\nfor Education and Minister for Cultural Affairs of the \r\nPrincipality of Liechtenstein.\r\nMs. Frick (Liechtenstein): The migration and \r\nrefugee crises are at the heart of our debate these days, \r\nboth here and back home. People around the world are on \r\nthe move in unprecedented numbers. Some 65 million \r\nhave been forcibly displaced in the last year. At the \r\nsummit on Monday, we made an important collective \r\nstatement that should shape our policies — migration \r\nshould be a choice, not a necessity. The United Nations is \r\nthe place to address the drivers of forced displacement.\r\nOur second challenge to frame migration as a \r\npositive force. Migrants contribute to diversity and \r\nglobal wealth. They bring fresh skills and dynamism to \r\ntheir host countries. If they are integrated successfully, \r\nthey enrich societies. A positive narrative on \r\nmigration is not difficult to present. The facts speak \r\nfor themselves, but many of us lack the ability — and \r\noften the courage — to speak truthfully about the facts. \r\nExploiting fears in a search for short-term political \r\ngains is cynical. It is an unproductive game. We must \r\ndo better than that.\r\nMass atrocities are one of the main drivers of \r\ndisplacement; one needs only to take a look at the \r\ntragic situation in Syria and the massive displacement \r\nit has caused. Preventing genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes will eliminate one of the main \r\nreasons why people are forced to f lee their homes.The \r\nSecurity Council can enter a new phase of its history \r\nof engagement on these crimes, moving from shameful \r\nindifference to responsible action. One hundred and \r\ntwelve States subscribe to the code of conduct on \r\natrocity crimes of the Accountability, Coherence \r\nand Transparency Group. It offers the opportunity to \r\nchange the political culture in the Security Council so \r\nthat failures such as the one in Syria can become a thing \r\nof the past, and so as to make a significant reduction \r\nof forced displacement a reality. It goes hand in hand \r\nwith the Secretary-General’s Human Rights Up Front \r\ninitiative, which we warmly welcome.\r\nArmed conflicts also force people to f lee, often \r\nin large numbers. Many conflicts can be prevented if \r\ncompetent diplomacy is decisive and timely. The world \r\nis looking to the Organization to mobilize, and too \r\noften it is disappointed. Getting serious about conflict \r\nprevention should be a priority for the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral — with the necessary means provided by \r\nthe Member States. But let us not forget that armed \r\nconflict is a violation of the Charter of the United \r\nNations Charter in and of itself. For 70 years now, it \r\nhas been illegal to engage in an armed conflict, except \r\nin narrowly defined circumstances. We now can also \r\nhold the most egregious perpetrators of illegal use of \r\nforce responsible.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is \r\nthe most comprehensive blueprint for action we have \r\never agreed on — a pledge to our children and to all \r\nfuture generations. It is also an ambitious promise that \r\nwe can keep only it if we work together with resolve \r\nand persistence. All 17 Goals are of equal importance \r\nand they are all connected. We will treat them as such \r\nin our implementation effort, but we will naturally also \r\nplace special emphasis on the areas where we feel we \r\ncan make a special contribution.\r\nThe rule of law, in particular, is a long-standing \r\npriority for Liechtenstein. Accountable institutions, \r\naccess to justice for everyone and significant reduction \r\nof corruption — all these are key ingredients for \r\nsustainable development. Justice is credible and \r\neffective only if it is delivered in an even-handed \r\nmanner. Only if it is clear that nobody is above the law \r\ncan the law prevail. Ensuring accountability for the \r\nmost serious crimes under international law is therefore \r\ncrucial. \r\nFor almost 15 years now, the International Criminal \r\nCourt has been the symbol of our pledge that even the \r\nmost powerful are not above the law — that there will \r\nbe no impunity for perpetrators of the worst crimes. We \r\nfully support the Court and are committed to helping \r\nto improve it.\r\nWe look forward to the extension of the Rome \r\nStatute, whereby the Court’s jurisdiction will expand \r\nto include crimes of aggression and the most serious \r\nforms of the illegal use of force will be criminalized. \r\nThis will be a historic step, marking the first time since \r\nthe creation of the United Nations that an international \r\ntribunal will have such jurisdiction. The necessary \r\nnumber of States has ratified the relevant Kampala \r\nAmendments to the Rome Statute, and the activation \r\nof this ground-breaking regime is scheduled for 2017. \r\nI appeal to everyone to join the 32 States who have \r\nratified these Amendments — and to do so soon.\r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n28/52 16-29811\r\nThe Court is the strongest symbol that impunity is \r\nno longer an option. At the same time, it is also not \r\na solution to all problems. The Court’s capacity to \r\nhandle cases is limited, and there are still a significant \r\nnumber of States outside its jurisdiction. Among them \r\nare some that most warrant greater accountability, such \r\nas Syria. The crimes committed against its civilian \r\npopulation since 2011 are as atrocious as they are well-\r\ndocumented. The attack on the humanitarian convoy \r\nin Aleppo marks a new low. We understand that these \r\natrocious crimes will be thoroughly investigated, as \r\nthey should be. A peace process in a country must have \r\na strong accountability dimension. That is the least we \r\ncan provide after having failed the people of Syria for \r\nso long.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda also deals with one of the \r\ndefining human rights crises of our times — human \r\ntrafficking and modern slavery. Upon entering the \r\nUnited Nations from the North Lawn, one can see the \r\nmonument erected to commemorate the victims of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade. That is a dignified, important \r\nreminder of a terrifying crime against humanity. But \r\nlet us not be misled into believing that the scourge has \r\nbeen relegated to the past. Over 45 million people today \r\nlive in conditions that qualify as modern slavery, which \r\ngenerates billions of dollars. Every single country in \r\nthe world is affected by it and virtually no perpetrators \r\nare held accountable — even though slavery is outlawed \r\nuniversally.\r\nModern slavery is a complex phenomenon that \r\naffects all of us and should leave none of us indifferent. \r\nWe all have a chance to make a difference as individual \r\nconsumers and as policy-makers. Modern slavery is \r\nnot only one of the biggest human rights scandals of \r\nour times; it is also one of the biggest illegal business \r\nmodels. Liechtenstein will focus its contribution on \r\ndisrupting financial f lows and using relevant data for \r\ncriminal prosecutions — in short, on following the \r\nmoney. We will also work towards a greater involvement \r\nof international justice mechanisms in the cases where \r\nnational judiciaries systematically fail.\r\nI wish to pay tribute to Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon. We will remember him as a tireless advocate \r\nfor the purposes and principles of the United Nations. \r\nWe are thankful for his service.\r\nEffective leadership is a key ingredient for the \r\nsuccess of the Organization. We have therefore invested \r\na great deal in the selection process of the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We have achieved a new level of transparency, \r\nwhich is an important step forward. But we must be \r\nhonest with ourselves; we have started at such a low \r\nlevel that there is still a lot of room for improvement. \r\nThe opportunity to engage with declared candidates is \r\nwelcome. It should also be a given. We now must ensure \r\nthat the entire membership is consulted with respect to \r\nthe appointment itself. We strongly believe in giving \r\nthe next Secretary-General a single term of office. \r\nThat would enhance the independence of the Office \r\nof the Secretary-General, as prior office-holders have \r\nconfirmed.\r\nFinally, it is my strong personal wish to finally see \r\na woman lead the Organization — an Organization that \r\nhas been such a trailblazer for gender equality. We do \r\nbelieve that the appointment should be merit-based. The \r\nbest-qualified person available should be offered the \r\njob. I would be very happy if that person was a woman.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Charles Flanagan, Ministerfor Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade of Ireland.\r\nMr. Flanagan (Ireland): I am very pleased to have \r\nthe opportunity to address the General Assembly this \r\nafternoon on behalf of my country, Ireland. My address \r\nwill be framed under the overall theme of migration, an \r\nissue which in itself is a huge challenge for the global \r\ncommunity today, but also an issue that intersects with \r\nso many of the other challenges we continue to grapple \r\nwith as a community of nations.\r\nAs I stand at this rostrum in the great city of New \r\nYork, I am acutely aware of my own country’s long \r\nexperience — over several centuries — with emigration. \r\nIndeed, on the newly restored lawn just outside this \r\nbuilding, a haunting bronze sculpture by acclaimed \r\nIrish sculptor John Behan, entitled Arrival, depicts a \r\nhuddled group of Irish emigrants ready to disembark in \r\nNew York after f leeing starvation and poverty in their \r\nnative Ireland. Our own history as a people forms the \r\nenduring backdrop to our foreign policy agenda. That \r\npart of our past is unfortunately the tragic present for \r\nso many.\r\nThe origins of the migration crisis are complex \r\nand diffuse. Many migrants and refugees are f leeing \r\nconflict and violence; many others are f leeing poverty \r\nand deprivation. The vast scale and sustained nature \r\nof the movement is at times bewildering and threatens \r\nto overwhelm our rules-based migration systems. It \r\nconfronts us with a wide array of problems to overcome \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 29/52\r\nall at the same time: the harrowing violence in Syria, \r\nthe barbarism of Da’esh, the collapse of order within \r\nLibya and the practices of ruthless people-smugglers. \r\nThe continuous poverty and inequality in many parts of \r\nAfrica is also a significant driver of the mass movement \r\nof people. These are challenges that no one country \r\ncan resolve alone. These are challenges that must all \r\nbe tackled at the same time. These are challenges that \r\nrequire the international community of nations to work \r\nin close cooperation to overcome them.\r\nIreland is responding to the migration crisis in a \r\nvariety of ways. We have given priority to funding \r\nhumanitarian relief. We have provided over €60 million \r\nin support of the Syrian people in the region, most \r\nof it through United Nations organizations. We \r\nhave deployed ships from our naval service to the \r\nMediterranean to assist with vital search-and-rescue \r\nmissions. Ireland is participating in the European \r\nUnion programme to resettle refugees f leeing conflict. \r\nHere, at United Nations Headquarters, Ireland has acted \r\nas a facilitator, together with Jordan, to deliver the \r\nagreement on the New York Declaration for Refugees \r\nand Migrants (resolution 71/1).\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to commend Ireland’s \r\nteam at the United Nations, led by Ambassador David \r\nDonoghue, and our Jordanian colleagues, for their \r\nstalwart efforts over five months of negotiations among \r\n193 Member States. Ireland accepted this leadership \r\nrole at the United Nations because we know that no \r\ncountry can by itself resolve the vast challenges the \r\nworld currently faces.\r\nIn my address, I wish to set out why I believe a \r\nmultilateral approach is the only one that can work and \r\nwhy the United Nations must demonstrate its capacity \r\nto really deliver on solutions. I will set out how the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — which \r\nthe United Nations agreed one year ago following \r\na successful facilitation process shared by Ireland \r\nand Kenya — have the capacity, when implemented, \r\nto address many of the root causes of migration, by \r\nending poverty, reducing inequality and responding to \r\nclimate change.\r\nIreland is seeking election to the Security Council \r\nin 2020. We believe that our values and principles \r\nand our steadfast commitment to the United Nations \r\nwill enable us to make a valuable contribution if we \r\nare successful in that election. Today, I am asking for \r\nsupport from the nations that share these vital values.\r\nLast year, the United Nations marked 70 years since \r\nits establishment. At that time, we in Ireland celebrated \r\n60 years of active membership. On the occasion of that \r\nimportant anniversary, two things were clear: first, \r\nthe global challenges confronting the United Nations \r\nwere more complex than ever before, and secondly, \r\nthe United Nations and the international community \r\nhave the potential to respond to these challenges in a \r\ncomprehensive way. We demonstrated this potential \r\nthrough the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, including the SDGs, which were greatly \r\nsignificant in that they embody commitments by \r\nMember States to working across a range of issues to \r\neliminate poverty and achieve sustained development \r\nover the next 15 years. \r\nThe determined implementation of the SDGs \r\nwill enable us to address many of the root causes of \r\nmigration. Lack of economic opportunity is a substantial \r\ndriver of migration. To provide those opportunities, the \r\nSDGs set out an approach that involves investment in \r\nhealth care, education, water and sanitation and other \r\nessential services.\r\nAs States Members of the United Nations, we are \r\nnow called to meet our obligation to implement the \r\nSDGs domestically within our own borders, bilaterally \r\nwith our development partners, and multilaterally \r\nwithin regional and United Nations forums. Long-term \r\naction on underlying causes must be complemented by \r\nurgent steps to address the daily suffering arising from \r\nthe refugee and migrant crisis. Ireland is committed to \r\nhonouring pledges made at the World Humanitarian \r\nSummit in Istanbul.\r\nWe must collectively ensure that in addressing \r\ncrises closer to home we do not allow the more protracted \r\ncrises, those that do not appear in the headlines on a \r\ndaily basis, to be forgotten. The United Nations has a \r\ncentral role in humanitarian action. Ireland strongly \r\nsupports the efforts to reform the United Nations \r\nsystem and coordination mechanisms to ensure a more \r\neffective response to the complex humanitarian needs \r\naround the world, including the protection of vulnerable \r\ngroups in emergencies, most notably women and girls.\r\nThe most immediate trigger of mass migration is \r\nviolent conflict, which forces great numbers of people \r\nto f lee their homes and leave their communities. The \r\nhorrific human toll of the grinding conflict in Syria \r\nmounts daily, and many countries in the region and far \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n30/52 16-29811\r\nbeyond are grappling with the large-scale displacement \r\nof people that this conflict has created.\r\nNo two conflicts are comparable. However, I can \r\nsay that on my own island, on the island of Ireland, \r\nfor many years we experienced conflict, terrorism \r\nand loss of life. And with the support of a wide array \r\nof stakeholders, we eventually and painstakingly \r\nmanaged to build a sustainable peace process. Our \r\nlived experience of building peace and the ongoing \r\nprocess of reconciliation on the island of Ireland mean \r\nthat we are particularly conscious of the persistent and \r\ndetermined commitment required to overcome conflict. \r\nWe therefore give priority to investment in conflict \r\nprevention and post-conflict reconciliation. \r\nWe recognize the importance of the empowerment \r\nof women so that they can have a visible and recognized \r\nrole in the decision-making process. Gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment are key cross-cutting \r\npriorities for my country, Ireland. We are committed \r\nto strengthening our engagement on these priorities \r\nduring our membership in the Commission on the \r\nStatus of Women, which commences on 1 January 2017. \r\nIreland calls for the implementation of the conflict-\r\nprevention and peacebuilding aspects of the three high-\r\nlevel reviews of the United Nations peacekeeping and \r\npeacebuilding systems, which took place in 2015, and \r\nfor a sustained commitment to the women and peace \r\nand security agenda.\r\nWe in Ireland know all too well that negotiating \r\nlasting political solutions for conflicts is often a lengthy \r\ntask, with many stops and starts and setbacks along the \r\nway. Ireland welcomes and is actively participating in \r\nthe initiative led by France to revive the stalled Middle \r\nEast peace process, with the aim of leading ultimately \r\nto a negotiated two-State solution. The United Nations \r\nmust play a central role in efforts to create the conditions \r\nfor finding a political solution.\r\nSix years into the horrific conflict in Syria, Ireland \r\nreaffirms its full support for the tireless efforts of the \r\nSpecial Envoy of the Secretary-General for Syria, \r\nMr. Staffan de Mistura, to bring about an end to the \r\ndevastating conflict through dialogue and diplomacy. \r\nWe urge everybody in this Hall to play his or her part.\r\nThe continent of Africa is of course the source, \r\nbut also the host, of the largest number of migrants \r\nand refugees, many of whom are f leeing war and \r\npoverty. Ireland calls for a transparent, accountable \r\nand human-rights-based resolution to the numerous \r\nconflicts in African countries, such as South Sudan, \r\nSomalia, Burundi, Mali and the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo. Those conflicts are severely hampering \r\nsustainable development on the continent and creating \r\nenormous humanitarian burdens for the affected \r\ncountries, indeed for neighbouring countries as well, \r\nand the wider international community.\r\nOn a positive note, Ireland warmly welcomes the \r\nhistoric peace agreement reached in Colombia last \r\nmonth following five decades of conflict, four years \r\nof talks and, tragically, the killing of over 225,000 \r\npeople. Each of these deaths represents a horrendous \r\nloss to their families and their loved ones and to their \r\ncommunities. We look forward to the signature of the \r\nfinal peace accord later this month, and we welcome the \r\nvital role played by the United Nations in monitoring \r\nthe implementation of that process. Ireland is \r\ncommitted to actively supporting the Colombian peace \r\nprocess. We are pleased to offer whatever assistance \r\nwe can to the process of rebuilding the country after \r\ndecades of violence, including through the sharing of \r\nour experience in Northern Ireland. We wish the people \r\nof Colombia well at this time of hope.\r\nAs part of our commitment to conflict prevention \r\nand resolution, we have championed, over many long \r\nyears, the matter of disarmament and non-proliferation, \r\nwhich must be placed at the fore of our collective efforts \r\nto prevent or minimize the impact of future conflict. \r\nWe must all be mindful of the grave humanitarian \r\nconsequences of any nuclear detonation, as well as \r\nthe devastating impact of conventional, biological and \r\nchemical weapons. We have seen this year — in fact, \r\nwe have seen this month — how a State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations can show in stark terms the reality of \r\nthe risk of a nuclear detonation.\r\nIreland wishes to see genuine progress on \r\nmultilateral nuclear disarmament, building on the \r\nwork of the Open-ended Working Group. We are also \r\nconcerned at evidence of harm to civilians from the \r\nuse of explosive weapons with wide-area effects and \r\nconsequences in populated areas. The disproportionate \r\ngender impact of nuclear weapons and of illegal arms \r\ntransfers and illicit trafficking in small arms and \r\nlight weapons is also a matter of great concern to us, \r\nas is the need to ensure greater gender balance in all \r\ndisarmament discussions.\r\nEffective and responsible United Nations \r\npeacekeeping is an important means of preventing \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 31/52\r\nforced displacement at a time of conflict or uneasy \r\npeace. Ireland is strongly committed to its active role \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations. We are \r\nproud of our unbroken record of service extending over \r\nalmost six decades.\r\nThis year we marked 100 years since our own \r\nEaster Rising, which set Ireland on the final phase of \r\nour path to independence, a highlight of our ongoing \r\ncommitment to peace, development and freedom. Our \r\ncommemoration included a parade of our defence forces \r\nmarching through the streets of our capital city, Dublin. \r\nMany of those marching proudly wore the blue berets \r\nof the United Nations, as an emblem of their service \r\nwith this great Organization. I take this opportunity \r\nto commend Irish soldiers and police participating \r\nin seven United Nations peacekeeping missions \r\naround the world for their courage, their bravery and \r\ntheir sacrifice.\r\nAn Irish Major General assumed the role of \r\nHead of Mission and Force Commander of the United \r\nNations Interim Force in Lebanon in July, and in \r\nNovember, we will assume the leadership of its Irish/\r\nFinnish battalion. We also remain actively committed \r\nto the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force. I \r\nrecently visited troops in the Golan and was very struck \r\nby the greater challenge of their operating environment \r\ntoday, compared with that of when the mission was \r\nestablished some years ago. I therefore urge colleagues \r\nin the United Nations to ensure that our troops are \r\nadequately supported as they go about this important, \r\nchallenging and often dangerous work.\r\nIn Ireland, service with the United Nations is \r\nrightly regarded as both noble and important. The \r\neffectiveness of the United Nations depends on its \r\npositive reputation as a force for good in the world. \r\nTherefore, it is critical that the performance, behaviour \r\nand reputation of troops or civilians engaged in United \r\nNations operations be held to the highest possible \r\nstandard. Sexual exploitation and abuse by United \r\nNations peacekeepers sent to conflict zones to protect \r\ninnocent civilians from harm is totally unacceptable. \r\nIreland calls for an end to impunity for these crimes. \r\nWe absolutely commit to holding our own troops \r\nfully accountable for their behaviour when they are \r\ndeployed overseas.\r\nHuman rights abuses are among the root causes of \r\nmigration. Moreover, migrants, refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons, in particular women, children and \r\nvulnerable people, can also be at risk of human rights \r\nabuse both during their journey and on arrival at their \r\ndestination.\r\nIreland is committed to defending those who defend \r\nthe human rights of others, including journalists and \r\nother civil-society representatives who face increasing \r\nrestrictions and threats in many parts of the world. Our \r\nleadership in the adoption of Human Rights Council \r\nresolution 32/31, on civil society space, last June \r\nenabled the international community to send a strong \r\nmessage of solidarity to those at risk. Ireland will \r\nalways speak out to defend minorities who continue \r\nto suffer persecution because of religion, belief, \r\nethnicity or gender, or a host of other reasons. We will \r\ncontinue to work on the European Union resolution on \r\nfreedom of religion or belief during this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOn the matter of United Nations reform, I am \r\npleased that the agreement reached on the SDGs has \r\nshowed what the United Nations can achieve when \r\nworking at its best. We call for all members of the \r\nSecurity Council — in particular China, the United \r\nStates of America, the Russian Federation, the United \r\nKingdom and France — to refrain from voting \r\nagainst credible draft resolutions on action to halt the \r\ncommission of genocide, crimes against humanity or \r\nwar crimes, including conflict-related sexual violence.\r\nIreland believes that the Security Council \r\nmembership should be more balanced and ensure wider \r\nregional representation, particularly with regard to \r\nAfrica. The more open, transparent and inclusive process \r\ntaking place this year to select the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral is a positive step in the right direction.\r\nMr. Bhattarai (Nepal), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe must collectively do all that we can to ensure \r\nthat the 65 million people currently displaced, whether \r\nby conflict, natural disaster or oppression, are provided \r\nwith the essential services to which they are entitled. \r\nWe need to uphold on all occasions the values, purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations. These are the \r\nvalues, purposes and principles that Ireland has stood \r\nup for throughout our engagement with the United \r\nNations regime, and which will inspire our contribution \r\nto the Security Council, should the membership entrust \r\nus with that responsibility in the 2020 election.\r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n32/52 16-29811\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Lilja Dögg Alfreðsdóttir, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Iceland.\r\nMs. Alfreðsdóttir (Iceland): At the end of the \r\nnineteenth century, one quarter of the Icelandic \r\npopulation emigrated to Canada and the United \r\nStates. Iceland was one of the poorest countries in \r\nEurope, and people were seeking a better life for \r\nthemselves and their families. The image of the \r\nstruggling Icelander — crossing the ocean, seasick and \r\nhungry — is still embedded in the minds of our people. \r\nBut we do know that many of our fellow countrymen \r\nachieved success in their new home. I truly believe that \r\nthey have had a positive impact on their communities. \r\nThe Icelandic migrants were not refugees. They were \r\nnot f leeing war and disaster. But they were seeking \r\nsafety and better lives for their families.\r\nToday, millions of people are displaced by conflict \r\nand disaster. The long-term goal of the international \r\ncommunity must be to create peace where there is \r\nconflict and economic opportunities where there are \r\nnone, so that countries of origin do not lose their human \r\ncapital and people can stay safely in their homes. \r\nToday, we are faced with humanitarian crisis and we \r\nmust all step up to the plate. Iceland — a country of \r\nonly 330,000 people — has contributed to addressing \r\nthe issue, both with funding to the relevant institutions \r\nand by welcoming a group of Syrian refugees. In the \r\nweeks to come, we are welcoming another group from \r\nSyria, bringing the overall number in 2016 to more than \r\n100. For a small country, these numbers are big — the \r\nequivalent of 100,000 in the United States.\r\nThe Middle East and North Africa regions remain \r\nin conflict and crisis, often driven by injustice and \r\nhuman rights failures. The Syrian conflict continues \r\nto inflict suffering on millions. I strongly condemn \r\nthe attack on the United Nations humanitarian convoy \r\nearlier this week and the new attacks on Aleppo. I also \r\nurge the conflicting parties, and especially the Syrian \r\nGovernment, to commit to finding a political solution. \r\nThe suspected war crimes committed in this conflict \r\nthreaten to undermine international law for the time \r\nto come. These war crimes must be prosecuted. Along \r\nwith others, I praise the generosity of the neighbouring \r\nStates — Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey — in addressing \r\nthe issue.\r\nIt should be possible to resolve the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict, but actions by both sides have \r\ncontinued to undermine the negotiation of a two-State \r\nsolution. There is violence and provocation on both \r\nsides. Settlement expansion and the destruction of \r\nPalestinian structures undermine the basis for peace. \r\nThe Security Council should take action to back the \r\nrecommendations of the Quartet via a resolution. At \r\nthe same time, we urge the parties to foster a climate \r\nof tolerance.\r\nThe sense of injustice and failure of governance \r\nis often at the root of other conflicts. The question \r\nof Western Sahara remains unresolved. We urge both \r\nsides to exercise restraint and to do their utmost to \r\nreduce tensions in line with United Nations resolutions.\r\nAfrica and the Middle East are the regions worst \r\nhit by terrorism and violent extremism. But no country \r\nis left untouched, and terrorism has returned to Europe. \r\nThat is a vivid reminder for my region that other \r\nsocieties may harbour individuals with beliefs that can \r\nbe turned into justifications for violence and terrorism. \r\nIt is a global threat of massive scope and complexity. \r\nWe must act together as a world community. We must \r\nimprove United Nations coordination in dealing with \r\nterrorism and violent extremism. We must challenge \r\nnarratives and ideologies together and identify internal \r\nand external drivers of violent extremism and terrorism.\r\nNelson Mandela said, Education is the most \r\npowerful weapon which you can use to change the \r\nworld.” Education is a precondition of good governance. \r\nIf people do not know their rights or how to seek justice \r\nand do not understand the views of others, then building \r\npeaceful and inclusive societies is very difficult. \r\nEducation remains a key pillar in Iceland’s development \r\ncooperation. Over the past 70 years Icelandic society \r\nhas developed from being a poor society to a modern, \r\nprosperous economy. We could not have done that if we \r\nhad not ensured access for all to quality education at \r\nboth secondary and higher levels.\r\nEducation shines a light on our path to ensuring \r\nhuman rights for all. In one century, women have seen \r\ngreat progress, even though the progress is uneven. I \r\nstand here today, one of only 30 or so female Foreign \r\nMinisters in the world, as proof that we have come a \r\nlong way, yet not nearly far enough. Women’s human \r\nrights lag severely behind in many countries, at great \r\ncost to women, men and society as a whole.\r\nWe have agreed that no one can be left behind. That \r\nincludes every individual, no matter the colour of her or \r\nhis skin, her or his disability or religion or whom she or \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 33/52\r\nhe loves. If we want resilient and healthy societies, we \r\nmust make it our business to safeguard the rights and \r\ninterests of minority groups, including lesbian, gay, \r\nbisexual and transgender groups.\r\nThe United Nations is the heart and soul of all \r\ninternational efforts. It is our responsibility to safeguard \r\nthe Organization and ensure that it is ready for the \r\nchallenges ahead. The new approach for appointing \r\nthe Secretary-General raises the profile and standing \r\nof the United Nations. It is a major milestone to see \r\nsuch a strong field of women candidates. I would like \r\nto pay tribute to the former President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. Lykketoft, for his efforts to make the \r\nnew approach work. It is now for the Security Council \r\nto propose to the General Assembly a candidate who \r\nhas wide support, credibility and respect. I hope we \r\nwill succeed in finding her or him.\r\nWe have set our sights high for the future of our \r\nplanet. We have set goals to address climate change. We \r\nhave mapped out a course to sustainable development \r\nthat is universal, leaves no one behind and preserves our \r\nplanet. The rules and objectives have been agreed — a \r\nmajor achievement. Now we have to implement them. \r\nWith political will, knowledge-sharing and innovation, \r\nI am confident that we will succeed.\r\nA large number of States have already ratified \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, thus paving \r\nthe way for its early entry into force. In particular, I \r\nwelcome the leadership shown by the United States \r\nof America and China. And I am proud to inform the \r\nAssembly that I handed over Iceland’s instrument of \r\nratification earlier this week.\r\nThe world’s common road map to sustainable \r\ndevelopment — the 2030 Agenda — should be taped \r\nto the wall of every planning ministry. The Icelandic \r\nGovernment is keenly aware that the Agenda needs \r\nto concern every one of us. The Agenda presents \r\nchallenges and opportunities to government, business \r\nand civil society in every country.\r\nIn Iceland we want to be sure of reaching the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) on time. W \r\nare therefore setting up the structures and identifying \r\nthe gaps to help us do that. Iceland aims to present \r\nits own national review in two years. Sharing ideas \r\nand knowledge will be a key element of our common \r\nsuccess. For many years, Iceland has hosted United \r\nNations University training programmes in four areas \r\nof importance to our agenda, namely, gender equality, \r\nsustainable geothermal energy, sustainable management \r\nof the oceans and combating desertification. We will \r\ncontinue to make a contribution in those areas of \r\nIcelandic expertise.\r\nTwenty-two years ago I lived in South Korea. To \r\nmy surprise, I saw many similarities between Iceland \r\nand South Korea. Both countries rose from poverty \r\nto prosperity in only a few decades, and both gained \r\nindependence in the 1940. And both are democracies \r\nand base their economic welfare on market economics.\r\nIn contrast, the people of North Korea still live in \r\npoverty, with a gross domestic product per capita equal \r\nto only 5 per cent of that of their cousins to the south. \r\nThey experience higher infant mortality and lower life \r\nexpectancy than their cousins, and even starvation. \r\nSevere human rights violations are committed by a \r\ndictatorship Government. It is shocking to see how \r\nthe Government of North Korea continues its illegal \r\npursuit of nuclear weapons, thereby risking not only \r\nthe security of its own people and the entire region but \r\nalso international security. Iceland strongly condemns \r\nNorth Korea’s nuclear testing, which is in breach of \r\nuniversally accepted norms and international law.\r\nAs politicians we bear a heavy responsibility to \r\ngovern to the best of our ability and in the interests \r\nof all people. Good governance is outlined in a key \r\nglobal goal. In many ways, it is the keystone of the 2030 \r\nAgenda.\r\nWhile each nation is sovereign, none of us is \r\nisolated from the world or world events. Yet we \r\nhave seen powerful countries breach fundamental \r\nprinciples of international law by invading other States. \r\nInternational law is key to cross-country relations and \r\nthe integrity of our global system. For a small and \r\npeaceful country like mine, international law is our \r\nsword, shield and shelter.\r\nIn 2006 nobody had heard of iPhones or tablets or \r\napps, there were no apple slices at McDonald’s, and \r\nSegways were seen only in science fiction movies. \r\nBut 2006 brought two things that everyone in this \r\nbuilding seems to love, namely, Twitter and Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, who is stepping down after 10 successful \r\nyears as Secretary-General of the United Nations. \r\nDuring those years we have seen tremendous change. \r\nHis personal commitment to fighting climate change \r\nhas been a key factor in our reaching agreement. He \r\nhas laid the groundwork for reforming United Nations \r\npeacekeeping operations. And he has shown strong \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n34/52 16-29811\r\nleadership on gender issues. On behalf of Iceland, \r\nI would like to thank Mr. Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nextraordinary contribution as Secretary-General.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Sirodjidin Aslov, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan.\r\nMr. Aslov (Tajikistan): It gives me a great pleasure \r\nto join the cordial congratulations on the well-deserved \r\nelection of the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session. We are confident that his wisdom, \r\ndiplomatic experience and skill will contribute to the \r\nsuccess of the current session, and my delegation would \r\nlike to assure him of its full cooperation to that end. I \r\nwould also like to take this opportunity to commend \r\nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, \r\nfor his able leadership during the previous session.\r\nI also avail myself of this opportunity to express \r\nour sincere appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, Secretary-General of the United Nations, for \r\nhis tireless efforts during his two terms in promoting \r\nglobal peace and security, development and well-being \r\nfor all peoples of the world. His competent and effective \r\nleadership has been a positive force in reforming the \r\nSecretariat, easing crises and disputes, addressing \r\ncurrent and emerging challenges and elaborating a \r\nnew agenda on sustainable development and climate \r\nchange. For all of those efforts, I would like to convey \r\nthe sincere gratitude of the people of the Republic \r\nof Tajikistan.\r\nThe year 2015 was momentous because of the \r\nadoption of a number of key documents aimed at \r\nstrengthening the global development agenda. Those \r\ndocuments are interrelated and will define the path \r\nof our development in the coming decades. However, \r\nwe have been less successful in addressing issues \r\naffecting international peace and security. Armed \r\nconflicts continue to pose a growing threat in various \r\nregions of the world. Destructive and inhumane forces \r\nof terrorism and extremism have been gaining power \r\nby attracting into their orbits ever-increasing numbers \r\nof youth, thereby seriously undermining efforts to \r\nmaintain security and peaceful development.\r\nCombating international terrorism and extremism \r\nhas become a top priority. There is a need to develop \r\nnational, regional and international mechanisms \r\naimed at eliminating military infrastructure, channels \r\nfor financial and logistical support, recruitment and \r\nviolent propaganda, including counteracting the use of \r\nmodern Internet and computer technology for terrorism \r\npurposes. Moreover, it is essential that we jointly seek \r\nways of addressing the issue of poverty, the negative \r\nimpact of globalization, and conflict prevention \r\nand settlement. There is also a need to strengthen \r\nintercultural and interfaith dialogue, mutual trust and \r\ntolerance. In that context, the United Nations remains \r\nthe key platform for achieving consensus on the main \r\nissues of international security and development \r\nand for coordinating joint action by the international \r\ncommunity in addressing the challenges and threats \r\nof today.\r\nEliminating illicit drug trafficking, which has \r\nbecome a breeding ground for terrorism and organized \r\ncrime, requires the joint and concerted actions of \r\nthe entire international community. We believe that \r\nthe fight against drug trafficking is an essential \r\npart of the fight against organized crime, terrorism \r\nand extremism, and we reaffirm that international \r\ncooperation on drug control will remain a priority \r\nof the Government of Tajikistan. The special session \r\nof the General Assembly on the world drug problem, \r\nheld in April 2016, provided a unique opportunity for \r\nseeking new and additional ways of strengthening \r\ncooperation in combating the root causes of the drug \r\nproblem and dealing with its consequences. During its \r\nmembership on the Commission on Narcotic Drugs, \r\nTajikistan will continue its cooperation with donor \r\ncountries and international organizations, including the \r\nUnited Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, in order to \r\nimplement the outcome document of the special session \r\nresolution S-30/1, annex).\r\nTajikistan stands for a comprehensive settlement \r\nof the crises in the Middle East, which will contribute \r\nto enhancing global security. We therefore support \r\ninternational and regional efforts aimed at restoring and \r\nstrengthening peace and stability in the Middle East, \r\nincluding the efforts to resume and accelerate credible \r\nnegotiations under the Middle East peace process.\r\nTajikistan supports the international strategy \r\nfor a comprehensive settlement and post-conflict \r\nreconstruction in Afghanistan. We need to strengthen \r\nour support to the Government of Afghanistan, \r\nespecially during Afghanistan’s transformation \r\ndecade 2015-2024. It is important for Afghanistan to \r\nbecome involved in the process of regional integration \r\nby strengthening its economic and trade ties with its \r\nneighbouring countries. We call for the expansion of \r\ntargeted assistance to Afghanistan aimed at economic \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 35/52\r\nrehabilitation, the strengthening of its social conditions \r\nand the creation of new jobs in its economy. We are \r\nready to take part in rehabilitating the social and \r\neconomic infrastructure of Afghanistan by connecting \r\nthe transport arteries of our two countrie by creating \r\nan energy bridge known as CASA-1000, and providing \r\nthe Afghan population with essential commodities and \r\ntraining for specialists.\r\nWe are at the beginning of a transformation \r\nprocess that started with the setting of a new agenda \r\nthat ref lects the hopes and desires of every one of us for \r\na decent and secure future. It is obvious that the path \r\nto sustainable development will be neither easy nor \r\nsmooth. At the same time, our political will should be \r\nreinforced by adequate means of implementation. There \r\nis a need to mobilize additional financial resources, \r\nincluding official development assistance, which is \r\nthe main component in financing development. Under \r\nthe current circumstances, it is essential to revitalize \r\ninternational trade and investments, which are the \r\nmain engines of productive growth, and encourage \r\nand promote transfers of innovative and ecologically \r\nsound technologies.\r\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda also \r\nrequires clear and transparent mechanisms to follow up \r\nand review both progress and problems. As a new and \r\nfirst-time member of the Economic and Social Council, \r\nTajikistan is willing to do its part in strengthening \r\nand coordinating the efforts to address the complex \r\nissues of achieving sustainable development. In our \r\nendeavours to achieve sustainable development, we \r\nneed to remember our collective determination to lend \r\na hand to countries that are confronted with difficulties. \r\nWe need to remember that a number of countries will \r\nbegin their implementation of the new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development in unfavourable conditions. \r\nIn particular, there is a need to provide support to \r\ncountries in special situations, especially the least \r\ndeveloped countries, landlocked developing countries \r\nand small island developing States.\r\nAccess to modern and cost-efficient energy services \r\nis key to achieving sustainable development. Tajikistan \r\nactively supports the Secretary-General’s Sustainable \r\nEnergy for All initiative and the United Nations 2014-\r\n2024 Decade of Sustainable Energy for All.\r\nI would like to emphasize that the 2030 Agenda \r\nregards water as the most essential element of life \r\nand the main component of development. That is a \r\npositive shift, which makes the new water agenda more \r\ncomprehensive and integrated by comparison with the \r\nprevious water agenda, framed within the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals. In that regard, we should take into \r\nconsideration the fact that climate change, as well as \r\nthe processes of urbanization and population growth, \r\nwill certainly exacerbate any challenges. In addition, \r\nas a result of climate change, water shortages in many \r\nparts of the world will increase owing, first of all, to \r\na reduction in the scale of glaciers and the snowpack. \r\nFor instance, in Tajikistan during the past 35 to 40 \r\nyears more than 1,000 massive glaciers out of a total \r\nof 13,000 have melted completely. That melting of \r\nglaciers and ice caps has caused increased frequency \r\nand intensity of natural disasters and the deterioration \r\nof ecosystems, which have translated to significant \r\nfinancial and material losses for the national economy \r\nand, unfortunately, have caused human casualties.\r\nNevertheless, the new water agenda is achievable. \r\nWe have observed that significant progress can \r\nbe made when countries and regions commit to \r\nprioritizing water challenges. What is clear is that \r\ncountries and the international community as a whole \r\nmust work together and undertake coordinated efforts \r\nand adopt both urgent and long-term measures. That is \r\nparticularly true when water is shared among various \r\nsectors — health, agriculture, energy and navigation, \r\nfor example — or when surface and groundwater are \r\nshared among communities and between countries. \r\nThose were among the issues related to the \r\nimplementation of the global water agenda discussed \r\nat the High-level Symposium on SDG 6 and Targets: \r\nEnsuring that No One Is Left Behind in Access to Water \r\nand Sanitation, held in Dushanbe on 9 and 10 August \r\nand jointly organized by the Government of Tajikistan, \r\nthe United Nations Department of Economic and \r\nSocial Affairs and various United Nations agencies. \r\nThe Symposium provided a platform for a balanced \r\ndiscussion of policy measures, actions and the means \r\nto fast-track the implementation of the water-related \r\nSDGs and targets. It adopted a call for action that \r\ninvites the international community to deepen its \r\ncooperation at all levels to address emerging water \r\nissues, to improve capacity in the implementation and \r\nmonitoring of integrated water resources management \r\nand to support an International Decade for Action \r\n“Water for Sustainable Development”, 2018-2028.\r\nI would like to express our sincere gratitude to \r\nall Member States for their active participation in the \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n36/52 16-29811\r\nSymposium. I hope that the members of the Assembly \r\nwill also support the proposed International Decade, \r\nwhich will strengthen and enhance the progress \r\nachieved during the previous International Decade for \r\nAction, “Water for Life”, 2005-2015, and will create a \r\nsolid platform for the consolidation of our efforts aimed \r\nat the sustainable management of water resources \r\nin the post-2015 period. The proposed International \r\nDecade will complement other initiated mechanisms, \r\nnotably the High-level Panel on 2030 Global Water \r\nArchitecture, and it can serve to fill any gaps that may \r\narise in the implementation of new 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Prakash Sharan Mahat, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal.\r\nMr. Mahat (Nepal): I wish to begin by \r\ncongratulating the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at the seventy-first \r\nsession. I wish to assure him of my delegation’s full \r\nsupport in the successful discharge of his important \r\nresponsibilities. I also want to commend the outgoing \r\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for \r\nhis effective leadership at the seventieth session.\r\nI wish to place on record Nepal’s admiration \r\nof His Excellency Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor the dedication with which he served this world \r\nOrganization for the past 10 years. We wish him well \r\nfor the future.\r\nExactly six decades ago, at the eleventh session \r\nof the General Assembly, Nepal first spoke as a newly \r\nadmitted Member. Now, 60 years down the road, our \r\ncommitment to the United Nations has become even \r\nstronger. The principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations remain at the core of Nepal’s foreign policy. \r\nAs much as the United Nations has contributed to \r\nour development endeavours, and lately to the peace \r\nprocess, Nepal has significantly contributed to the \r\nUnited Nations in fulfilling its primary responsibility \r\nof maintaining international peace and security.\r\nIt has been a year since we adopted the universal \r\nand transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, with the objective of leaving no one \r\nbehind. After one year, it is clear now that much more \r\nneeds to be done to move from commitments to results. \r\nLet me stress the fact that the secure foundation of world \r\npeace rests on the well-being of the peoples across the \r\nglobe. Poverty reduction and sustainable development \r\nare therefore inseparable. We cannot imagine a \r\npeaceful, prosperous and secure society when millions \r\nof people live in poverty. I therefore urge all Member \r\nStates and our development partners to move beyond \r\nrhetoric and commence concrete actions without losing \r\ntime, energy or zeal.\r\n It is also evident that the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) cannot be realized unless sound \r\ndevelopment policies and frameworks are supported by \r\na capable institutional framework, adequate resources \r\nand innovative methods of implementation. As much \r\nas national commitment, ownership, leadership and \r\npeople-centric governance are critical in the domestic \r\ncontext, robust international partnerships are equally \r\nimportant to ensure the success of the SDGs. We would \r\nlike to see progress in terms of the principal components \r\nof the resource base — official development assistance, \r\ntrade, foreign direct investment, technology and debt \r\nrelief — to ensure the smooth implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda.\r\nNepal’s commitment to the SDGs is informed by \r\nits success in reaching the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs). Amid multiple challenges, Nepal’s \r\nperformance in that respect was impressive. We were \r\nable to halve the proportion of people living in poverty \r\nand to significantly reduce the maternal and infant \r\nmortality rates. We were able to send more children \r\nto school and keep them in school. The enrolment of \r\ngirls in schools was substantially increased. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development is now part of our \r\nnational development plans and programmes and will \r\nbe implemented with the utmost priority.\r\nThe vision for a safer world continues to elude us. New \r\nsources of threats to humankind have emerged, while \r\nthe traditional sources of threats have simultaneously \r\nbecome more pronounced. The forms and intensity \r\nof non-traditional threats to security — terrorism, \r\ntransnational crimes, ethnic tensions, intra-State \r\nconflicts and violent extremism — have multiplied. \r\nThe abuse by criminal actors of innovations in \r\ninformation and communications technology has added \r\nto social vulnerability. We underline the central role \r\nof the General Assembly and the Security Council in \r\naddressing such threats and challenges.\r\nThe increasing terrorist activity in our own region \r\nand in many parts of the world is a matter of serious \r\nconcern for all of us. Terrorism is a serious threat \r\nto the human goal of living in harmony, peace and \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 37/52\r\ndignity. Nepal condemns terrorism in all its forms \r\nand manifestations. The failure of the international \r\ncommunity to agree on a comprehensive convention on \r\ninternational terrorism is highly frustrating. We call \r\nupon the international community to muster the much-\r\nneeded political will to accomplish this agenda.\r\nTo create a secure world we must adopt a two-\r\ntrack approach. We must deal with emerging threats \r\nresolutely, firmly and collectively. On a much broader \r\nscale, we also need to nurture a culture of peace. \r\nAs the birthplace of Lord Buddha, Nepal believes \r\nthat meaningful exchanges and dialogues among \r\ncivilizations will help instil positive values, which will \r\ncontribute to eventual world peace.\r\nWe would like to see an early resolution of the \r\nconflict in Syria. The suffering of the Syrian people \r\nmust now come to an end. Nepal supports the call \r\nfor a just, lasting and comprehensive peace in the \r\nMiddle East. We recognize the legitimate right of \r\nthe Palestinian people to an independent State, based \r\non United Nations resolutions, and the right of every \r\nnation in the region to live in peace, within secure and \r\nrecognized international boundaries.\r\nNepal stands for the complete and time-bound \r\ndisarmament of all weapons of mass destruction, \r\nincluding nuclear ones.An environment must be created \r\nin which development dividends can be released by \r\ndisarmament and redirected towards productive use. \r\nThe global community, especially the nuclear States, \r\nmust make a determined effort to move forward from \r\nthe stalled negotiations on disarmament. We believe that \r\nall efforts to bring about disarmament must be pursued \r\nin good faith and in full compliance with the agreed \r\ninternational regimes. Based on our principled position, \r\nNepal hosts the United Nations Regional Centre for \r\nPeace and Disarmament in Asia and the Pacific. We \r\ninvite Member States and partners to support and fully \r\nutilize the Centre to promote dialogue on disarmament, \r\nthereby enhancing the Kathmandu process.\r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations are \r\nan important innovation of the United Nations and \r\nare dedicated to the service of humankind. Nepal’s \r\nengagement in peacekeeping operations, started just \r\nthree years after joining the United Nations, speaks \r\nvolumes about our unflinching commitment to the \r\ncause of international peace and security. We feel proud \r\nto be part of that f lagship contribution. Our troops have \r\nserved in various challenging peacekeeping missions \r\nwith a high degree of professionalism, commitment \r\nand devotion. That has helped them earn international \r\nacclaim. Seventy-three of our fellow countrymen \r\nhave sacrificed their lives in the line of duty to the \r\nsupreme cause of peace. We remain steadfast in our \r\ncommitment to fulfil our obligations and are prepared \r\nto provide additional troops and civilians to United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. That is because \r\nwe have a strong conviction that the success of the \r\nUnited Nations largely hinges on the success of its \r\npeacekeeping operations.\r\nHowever, we also believe that for the peacekeeping \r\nmissions to be successful, there must be unity of \r\npurpose in mobilizing all of the political capital of the \r\nSecurity Council. We must establish clearly defined \r\nmandates and operational modalities, provide adequate \r\nresource back-up, ensure the safety and security of \r\npersonnel, arrange regular consultations and greater \r\ncollaboration with the troop-contributing countries \r\nand devise clear exit strategies.We also believe that \r\npeacekeeping alone cannot guarantee durable peace \r\nin societies. It should be complemented by proper \r\nand clearly defined peacebuilding strategies led and \r\nowned by the people and societies themselves. We \r\nwould also like to underline that all troop-contributing \r\ncountries must be afforded fair opportunities to \r\nserve in leadership positions, both in the field and at \r\nHeadquarters, commensurate with the level and length \r\nof their contributions.\r\nWe are satisfied that human rights values have \r\nnow become truly global. Human rights must not be \r\nused as a tool to serve hidden political interests. All \r\nhuman rights, including the right to development, must \r\nreceive equal priority and be pursued even-handedly. \r\nThe salient features of non-selectivity, universality, \r\nindivisibility and objectivity must be upheld in all \r\ncircumstances. The sanctity of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the innovative universal periodic review \r\nmechanism must be maintained to ensure the full \r\nownership of human rights.\r\nNepal’s commitment to human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms is total and unwavering. We are \r\nparty to most of the core international human rights \r\ninstruments, which have found eloquent expression \r\nin Nepal’s newly promulgated Constitution. The \r\nnew Constitution of Nepal, which was the result of \r\neight years of deliberation that ensured participatory, \r\ntransparent and inclusive processes, includes an \r\nimpressive list of human rights and provides adequate \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n38/52 16-29811\r\nremedial measures. Nepal has abolished the death \r\npenalty and is a party to the first Optional Protocol to \r\nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. \r\nIt has put in place the necessary legal, institutional \r\nand administrative measures for the realization of all \r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe National Human Rights Commission and other \r\nindependent constitutional bodies were established \r\nwith the sole objective of protecting and promoting \r\nhuman rights in all spheres of national life. Nepal’s \r\nhomegrown peace process recognizes transitional \r\njustice as its key component. The Commission on \r\nInvestigation of Disappeared Persons and the Truth \r\nand Reconciliation Commission are carrying out their \r\nmandates in an independent and impartial manner. \r\nThe Government is committed to taking appropriate \r\nmeasures to address the issues surrounding the process \r\nof transitional justice in line with our international \r\ncommitment and the ground realities of establishing \r\nsustained peace.\r\nNepal has been working closely with the Human \r\nRights Council with all sincerity and commitment. \r\nInformed by our experience of protecting and promoting \r\nof human rights and our sincere desire to contribute to \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council, we are seeking \r\nmembership on the Council for the term beginning \r\n2018. It is the first time we have filed our candidature. \r\nWe request the support of all fellow Member States for \r\nour candidature.\r\nMigration has become a defining phenomenon \r\nof the contemporary world. The global movement \r\nof people has brought benefits and challenges. The \r\nproper management of migration can contribute to \r\nthe economic growth and development of both the \r\ndestination and the origin countries of migrant workers.\r\nThe welfare and the protection of the rights of migrant \r\nworkers must therefore receive priority in the countries \r\nin which they work. As the source country of over \r\n3 million migrant workers, Nepal calls for concerted \r\nefforts at the national, regional and international levels \r\nto ensure that the process creates a fair and win-win \r\nsituation for all.\r\nDespite not being a party to the 1951 Convention \r\nrelating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol, \r\nNepal has long hosted refugees on humanitarian \r\ngrounds. International burden-sharing has greatly \r\nhelped to lessen the burden host countries face. \r\nHowever, the right of refugees to return to their \r\nhomeland in safety and dignity must always be upheld \r\nin all circumstances.\r\nWhile globalization has created many opportunities, \r\nthe benefits which countries have reaped from it have \r\nbeen uneven. The constraints on countries in special \r\ncircumstances, particularly the least developed \r\ncountries and landlocked developing countries, are \r\nreal. That is why international financial, trading and \r\nmonetary systems must be responsive to their needs \r\nand concerns. Robust implementation of internationally \r\nagreed commitments, including those contained in the \r\nIstanbul Programme of Action, the Vienna Programme \r\nof Action, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the \r\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, are \r\ncritically important to enable those countries to emerge \r\nfrom the states of poverty and underdevelopment \r\nthey are experiencing. Delay in the conclusion of the \r\nDoha Round of trade negotiations is a huge setback; it \r\nis denying countries many development dividends of \r\ntrade and hampering the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nAs to climate change, Nepal, as a Himalayan \r\ncountry, faces challenges in the form of melting glaciers \r\nand f lash f loods from glacial-lake outbursts. We \r\nbelieve that the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \r\nadopted last year, ref lects a rare commitment by the \r\ninternational community to making a difference. We \r\nsupport its early entry into force. Nepal also believes \r\nthat climate justice based on the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities should be at the \r\ncentre of its implementation. Special attention must be \r\ngiven to the climate-vulnerable countries, particularly \r\nmountainous countries, as regards providing resources \r\nand transferring technology for capacity-building and \r\nadaptation. Our efforts must recognize the intrinsic \r\nconnection between poverty reduction, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and environmental protection.\r\nWe must acknowledge that the United Nations \r\nsystem has a leading role to play in global governance. \r\nEqual emphasis must be laid on all three pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations: development, peace and security, and \r\nhuman rights. The reform of the United Nations must \r\nref lect the vastly transformed political reality of the \r\ntwenty-first century. Our vision for sustainable peace \r\nand a just world order cannot be realized without a \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations, including \r\nreform of the Security Council. Nepal strongly believes \r\nin a more representative, inclusive and accountable \r\nUnited Nations.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 39/52\r\nIn recent years Nepal has undergone a political \r\ntransformation of historic proportions. The decade-long \r\narmed conflict was finally converted into a peace \r\nprocess with the signing of the Comprehensive Peace \r\nAccord in 2006. Commitment to democratic norms \r\nand values was the central thrust of the peace process, \r\nwhich led to the holding of the first-ever elections for \r\nthe Constituent Assembly. Arms management and the \r\nintegration of combatants was successfully carried out \r\nas part of the peace process. With the promulgation of \r\nthe democratic Constitution on 20 September last year, \r\nthe peace process basically came to a close.\r\nNepal’s homegrown peace process and its success \r\nmay provide a good model for countries transitioning \r\nfrom conflict to peace. The promulgation of our \r\nConstitution represents a turning point in Nepal’s \r\nconstitutional and political history. Among other \r\nthings, the Constitution aims to institutionalize \r\ninclusive and democratic polity, pluralism, the rule \r\nof law,  representative and accountable government, \r\nsocial and economic justice and universally accepted \r\nhuman rights.\r\nEquality is at the core of the Constitution. Equal \r\nopportunity and protection are guaranteed to every \r\ncitizen. Discrimination on any ground is prohibited. \r\nThe State is obliged to take special measures to protect \r\nthe most marginalized and underrepresented sections of \r\nsociety and ensure their well-being. Our Constitution is \r\nnot a rigid document, but rather a living and dynamic \r\none that is capable of addressing any remaining or new \r\nissues within its framework. The two amendments that \r\nwere made within months of its promulgation amply \r\nprove this.\r\nWe are currently engaged in dialogue with \r\nconcerned political parties to find an acceptable \r\nsolution to some of the issues where differences persist. \r\nThe Constitution guarantees equal participation and \r\nincorporates the principle of proportional representation \r\nof women, indigenous nationalities, Madhesis, Dalits \r\nand other marginalized groups in elective bodies and \r\nother organs of the State structure. Nepal has a strong \r\ncommitment to gender equality and the empowerment \r\nof women. Women are guaranteed a minimum of \r\none third representation in the federal and provincial \r\nparliaments, and 40 per cent in local government. I am \r\nproud to inform the General Assembly that in Nepal the \r\nHead of State, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court \r\nand the Speaker of the Parliament are all women.\r\nWe have entered a crucial phase in implementing \r\nour Constitution in Nepal. Our ultimate goal is to \r\nconsolidate peace and stability and bring about \r\nprosperity in the country. Inclusive economic growth \r\nand development are important to sustain political gains. \r\nThe Constitution provides a framework to pursue those \r\nobjectives. Democratic elections for all three tiers of \r\nthe federal system must be completed by February 2018. \r\nThat is a huge task, but we are determined to carry it \r\nout successfully, thereby helping to institutionalize the \r\nfederal democratic system of governance, as promised \r\nby the Constitution. Further tasks include addressing the \r\noutstanding issues of the peace process, reconstructing \r\nand rebuilding earthquake-ravaged areas and achieving \r\ninclusive prosperity and development; they constitute \r\nour top priorities.\r\nAs we embark upon the effective implementation of \r\nthe Constitution and undertake the vital process of the \r\nsocioeconomic transformation of Nepal, the goodwill, \r\nsolidarity and support of the international community \r\nbecome all the more important. We are confident that \r\nour friends in the international community will stand \r\nby us in our efforts to build a strong foundation for a \r\npeaceful, stable, democratic and prosperous Nepal.\r\nThe United Nations today is confronted with \r\nunprecedented challenges. However, unique \r\nopportunities also exist — and can be seized to \r\ntransform the world into a peaceful place in which to \r\nlive. We have the capacity, resources and technology \r\nto address the challenges and ensure prosperity and \r\ndignity for everyone. But we must muster the necessary \r\npolitical will to achieve that. Let us make a solemn \r\ncommitment here in the Hall of the General Assembly \r\nthat the world of tomorrow will be different from that of \r\ntoday. We want the history of the twenty-first century \r\nto unfold not as a history of conflict, strife, poverty, \r\nhunger and indignation, but as a history of prosperity, \r\npeace, development and partnership.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Jеаn-Claude Gakosso, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nCooperation and Congolese Nationals Abroad of the \r\nCongo. \r\nMr. Gakosso (Congo) (spoke in French): Allow me, \r\nat the outset, to convey my sincerest congratulations \r\nto Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-first session. The \r\nRepublic of the Congo, as one of the Vice-Presidents \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n40/52 16-29811\r\nwho will help to lighten his burden during the session, \r\nis fully committed to his success.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to pay \r\nheartfelt tribute to Mr. Ban Ki-Moon, who is coming \r\nto the end of his term of office as Secretary-General. \r\nThanks to his leadership, he has been able to mobilize \r\nworld leaders and all actors on the international stage \r\naround the great global challenges of our time. He has \r\nlaid the foundation for the reform of the Organization \r\nand created conditions conduciveto its fully undertaking \r\nits historic mission in global governance.\r\nThe Republic of the Congo welcomes the work \r\naccomplished by the outgoing President, Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, whose wisdom and foresight facilitated the \r\nunanimous adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. The Agenda heralds the historic advent \r\nof a new era of sustainable development.\r\nI would like to remind the Assembly that the \r\nGovernment of my country expended considerable \r\nresources on the implementation of the Millenium \r\nDevelopment Goals. We now seek to build our future \r\non these beginnings and continue our commitment \r\nby achieving the 17 Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nthe ultimate aim being to guarantee the welfare of the \r\nCongolese people. \r\nHowever, the efforts of our Government today \r\nrequire the support of the international community, \r\nspecifically through financial mechanisms such as the \r\nGreen Climate Fund, the Blue Fund, the Adaptation \r\nFund and the Green Economy Fund in Central Africa. \r\nI can assure the Assembly that the Government of my \r\ncountry will invest all available resources and spare \r\nno effort to ensure that all Congolese people live in \r\ndignity and that no one is left behind. Such was the \r\ncommitment undertaken by my country in adopting the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThe Republic of the Congo appreciates the value \r\nand significance of the decision at the Group of 20 \r\n(G-20) Summit held recently in Hangzhou, China, to \r\nsupport the industrialization of developing countries, in \r\nparticular in Africa, where this is greatly needed. This \r\ntimely decision reassures us of the commitment of the \r\nG-20 countries with a view to implementing Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 17 in its target of revitalizing the \r\nglobal partnership for sustainable development. We \r\nfail to see how Africa can develop sustainably and \r\nmodernize without first undergoing industrialization. \r\nWe know that industrialization is contingent upon an \r\nenergy supply, and it is for that reason that the Republic \r\nof the Congo fully supports the electrification plans for \r\nthe continent that are currently being discussed. We \r\ntrust that this is not a pious hope.\r\nFive years ago, we all welcomed the birth of the \r\nyoungest nation of this world, that is, the Republic \r\nof South Sudan. Unfortunately, two years after its \r\nindependence this country was plunged into seemingly \r\nendless fratricidal conflicts, for which its civilians have \r\npaid a heavy price. From this rostrum, we encourage \r\nall stakeholders in that conflict to demonstrate their \r\npolitical will and perseverance by committing in good \r\nfaith to the implementation of the peace agreement \r\nsigned in August 2015 in Addis Ababa. The severity \r\nof the situation in South Sudan today requires the \r\nrapid deployment of a regional protection force under \r\na Security Council mandate. Such deployment is \r\nimperative in all respects, for the time has come to end \r\nthis intolerable bloodbath that risks compromising the \r\nfuture of this young nation forever. Equally imperative \r\nis the need to build a climate of trust among the various \r\nprotagonists to the conflict in order to ensure that \r\nnational reconciliation can indeed be achieved.\r\nJust yesterday the Central African Republic fell \r\nprey to a grave crisis. Today, thanks to international \r\nsolidarity and the commitment of the United Nations, \r\nthe European Union, France, the United States and \r\nmembers of the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States, that country was able to successfully \r\nmanage a political transition, which concluded with \r\npresidential elections, thereby paving the way for a \r\nbetter future with collective hope. The Republic of \r\nthe Congo welcomes that accomplishment, which \r\nis an expression of the will of a people determined \r\nto rid themselves of their old demons and to restore \r\npeace and stability after several years of chaos. The \r\nRepublic of the Congo encourages the efforts for \r\npeace, reconciliation and reconstruction that President \r\nFaustin Archange Touadera and his Government \r\nare undertaking with courage and self-sacrifice. My \r\ncountry reiterates here — just as it did at the ninth \r\nmeeting of the International Contact Group on the \r\nCentral African Republic, held recently in Bangui - our \r\nsupport for, and solidarity with, our brother country \r\nwithin the framework of both the Multidimensional \r\nIntegrated Stabilization Mission in the Central African \r\nRepublic and the International Support Group.\r\nWe cannot but deplore the tragic events that have \r\nfor nearly a week now shaken Kinshasa and plunged the \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 41/52\r\nbrother people of the Democratic Republic of Congo \r\ninto mourning. As the Secretary-General did a few days \r\nago, we invite our Congolese brothers to seek peaceful \r\nsolutions through an inclusive dialogue in a spirit of \r\nmutual tolerance.\r\nThe post-electoral crisis in Gabon has engendered \r\nacts of violence that continue to be a source of concern \r\nfor us all. We very much hope that the brother people \r\nof that country will draw on that Bantu wisdom we \r\nshare with them in order to emerge reconciled from that \r\ndifficult ordeal.\r\nI could not conclude my statement without \r\nmentioning the recent institutional developments \r\nthat my own country has undergone following the \r\nreferendum held on 25 October 2015. The referendum \r\nled to the adoption of a new Constitution, better adapted \r\nto the requirements of a law-abiding State in its most \r\nwidely accepted form. We now have a Constitution \r\nthat strengthens the principle of the separation of \r\npowers, enshrines the independence of the judiciary, \r\nabolishes the death penalty, affirms the equality of \r\nmen and women, recognizes the fundamental rights \r\nof our indigenous peoples and lays the groundwork \r\nfor a participatory democracy. We have a Constitution \r\nthat, alongside our national human rights commission, \r\nestablishes bodies whose duty it is to maintain social \r\ncohesion through justice and equity, but also by \r\nbringing peace and tranquillity to hearts and minds. \r\nThey include a national dialogue council, a women’s \r\nadvisory council, a youth advisory council, a national \r\ncouncil of elders and an advisory council for people \r\nwith disabilities.\r\nIn short, all of these many innovations, which seek \r\nto respond to the desires of our sovereign people and \r\nthe many challenges facing us today, will undoubtedly \r\nimprove political, economic and social governance in \r\nour country. All of them are intended to benefit the \r\ngreater good of our people.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Erlan Abdyldayev, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Kyrgyz Republic.\r\nMr. Abdyldayev (Kyrgyzstan) (spoke in Russian): \r\nI would first like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson \r\non his election to preside over the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session, and to thank Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, President of the Assembly during the \r\nseventieth session, for his fruitful leadership of the \r\nAssembly’s work.\r\nKyrgyzstan supports the theme of our debate, “The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push to \r\ntransform our world”, which seems very timely to us in \r\nthe wake of the Assembly’s adoption last year of the 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals and the conclusion of \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nOn 31 August, Kyrgyzstan marked the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of its independence. Over the years we have \r\nbeen progressing along the difficult path of building a \r\ndemocratic, lawful and economically developed State. \r\nOnly six years have passed since the people’s revolution \r\nof April 2010, which paved the way for Kyrgyzstan’s \r\nrebirth. We are proud of what our country has achieved \r\nsince then. We have taken our own particular and \r\nvery difficult road to freedom and democracy, and \r\nwe have paid a high price for it. The freedom-loving \r\npeople of Kyrgyzstan have learned hard lessons from \r\nthe mistakes of their first 20 years of independence. \r\nToday, they have emerged from that onto the road to \r\nstability and shown the world the experience that they \r\nhave gained in overcoming acute social and political \r\ncrises and building a free society.\r\nKyrgyzstan has suffered, but has made a conscious \r\nchoice to build a parliamentary democracy. In October \r\n2015, for the first time in the country’s history, we \r\nheld national parliamentary elections using biometric \r\ntechnology. The election results were accepted by \r\nall political parties, a testimony to the unity of our \r\npeople, and have been unanimously recognized as \r\ndemocratic by the international community. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to express our gratitude \r\nto the Secretary-General and all friendly countries \r\nfor their support for our election preparations. In 2017 \r\nwe will hold presidential elections, and we urge the \r\nUnited Nations and our partner countries to continue \r\nsupporting Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to conduct the \r\nelections to choose our next leader in accordance with \r\ninternational standards.\r\nKyrgyzstan fully supports the adoption of a \r\ncomprehensive agenda for international development \r\nin the form of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We welcome the fact that the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals take into account the lessons of the \r\nefforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, \r\nas well as the needs of mountainous and landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries such as ours. For Kyrgyzstan, the \r\nbiggest priority areas in the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals include poverty reduction, food security, quality \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n42/52 16-29811\r\neducation and health care, economic growth, energy \r\nand the preservation of the environment.\r\nAs we know, one of the three pillars of the \r\n2030 Agenda consists of environmental issues. In \r\nParis, we all worked together to reach a consensus \r\non climate change. Kyrgyzstan fully supports that \r\nglobal agreement, and yesterday we signed the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change on the margins of the \r\ngeneral debate. In Kyrgyzstan, the effects of global \r\nwarming are already leading to natural disasters and \r\nextreme situations, with f luctuations in the volumes of \r\nmountain rivers, excessive melting of glaciers and the \r\ndegradation of unique mountain ecosystems. All of this \r\nhas led to negative social consequences and significant \r\nharm to economic sectors. We estimate that the \r\nannual damage from natural disasters in Kyrgyzstan \r\namounts to about $35 million, rendering us in need of \r\ninternational assistance in adapting to climate change.\r\nWe are particularly concerned about the increased \r\nmelting of our glaciers, which represent Central Asia’s \r\nnatural storage of water resources. The prediction is that \r\nby 2025 Kyrgyzstan’s total glacier area could shrink by \r\nan average of 30 to 40 per cent, resulting in a drop of \r\nbetween 25 and 35 per cent in the volumes of our rivers. \r\nKyrgyzstan therefore supports the undertaking of joint \r\nprojects aimed at conserving glaciers in countries in \r\nour region with mountain rivers. \r\nOn top of that, climate change is threatening the \r\nbiodiversity of our mountain ecosystems. In particular, \r\nsince the 1990s, our snow leopard population has fallen \r\nby half,  from 600 to 300 animals. In 2013 we held the \r\nfirst Global Snow Leopard Conservation Forum, which \r\nhas become the starting point for cooperation among \r\ncountries that have snow leopard habitats, as well as \r\nwith our international partners. Next year, Kyrgyzstan \r\nwill convene a second Global Forum, where we will \r\nconsider the results of the work that has been done \r\nand decide on future joint action for conserving those \r\nrare animals.\r\nAnother serious problem that cannot be solved \r\nwithout the international community’s participation \r\nis the presence of the numerous uranium tailings \r\nscattered throughout the countries of our region. The \r\nscale of the problem requires focused and coordinated \r\nwork within the framework of resolution 68/218, \r\nentitled “The role of the international community in \r\naverting the radiation threat in Central Asia”. In that \r\nconnection, we have proposed holding a high-level \r\ninternational forum on the resolution in May or June \r\n2017. The Kyrgyz Republic is ready to do the necessary \r\npreparatory work for the forum along with other \r\nconcerned countries and international organizations, \r\nand we hope to have the support of the international \r\ncommunity for those efforts.\r\nFor every State, sustainable development depends \r\non security and stability, including at the global level. \r\nUnfortunately, the current session of the General \r\nAssembly is taking place against a backdrop of \r\ninternational tension in Afghanistan, the countries \r\nof the Middle East and North Africa, and Ukraine. \r\nThe differences between the world’s major Powers \r\non current international political issues remain, and \r\nthe pressures of sanctions persist. Such international \r\ncircumstances and the confrontational attitude of some \r\ncountries are not conducive to dealing with today’s \r\nchallenges and threats through a collective approach \r\nconducted under United Nations auspices. Rather, their \r\nglobal nature demands that every country, without \r\nexception, continue to cooperate and collaborate in the \r\ninterests of all humankind. We believe that the world \r\nPowers must put aside their differences and pool their \r\nefforts to combat the threats to international security.\r\nIn an era of globalization, the processes involve \r\nother countries as well as the parties to a conflict. \r\nKyrgyzstan is no exception. We have unfortunately \r\nnot been spared by phenomena such as terrorism, \r\nextremism, religious intolerance and radicalization, \r\nalthough they began and evolved far beyond the borders \r\nof Kyrgyzstan. We have been obliged to act to protect \r\nthe interests of the State and our citizens. However, we \r\nbelieve it is more effective to deal with them locally \r\nfrom the start, in their own breeding grounds. It is \r\ncrucial that we provide international assistance to the \r\ncountries that are battling the problem at the national \r\nlevel, including within the framework of the Plan of \r\nAction to Prevent Violent Extremism proposed by the \r\nSecretary-General in January.\r\nIn combating terrorism and extremism, it is \r\nimportant to ensure that force is accompanied by \r\npreventive measures and intercultural dialogue. \r\nKyrgyzstan, like every other people, ethnic group and \r\ncountry, has its own unique history and culture. In \r\norder to popularize the peaceful values, traditions and \r\ncustoms of nomadic civilization, in 2011 Kyrgyzstan \r\nlaunched an initiative to stage the World Nomad Games, \r\nand thus in 2014, on the shores of the mountain lake \r\nIssyk-Kul, the first-ever World Nomad Games were \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 43/52\r\nheld. Two weeks ago, also by Issyk-Kul, we held the \r\nsecond World Nomad Games, in which representatives \r\nand athletes from 62 countries took part. Thousands \r\ncame to watch the uniquely spectacular and original \r\nathletic contests. \r\nThe World Nomad Games are helping to strengthen \r\nmutual understanding and cooperation among countries \r\nand peoples from many different cultures and religions. \r\nWith regard to , the Assembly’s resolution on the \r\npromotion of interreligious and intercultural dialogue, \r\nunderstanding and cooperation for peace, Kyrgyzstan \r\nsupports the inclusion of a provision supporting the \r\nperiodic holding of the World Nomad Games, and we \r\nare counting on support for that initiative from the \r\nStates Members of the United Nations.\r\nKyrgyzstan believes that if the countries of \r\nCentral Asia are to have sustainable development and \r\nsecurity, they must strengthen their mutual trust and \r\ncooperation. We have been compelled to confront the \r\nfact that many of the region’s problems are a long way \r\nfrom being solved successfully and functionally. Our \r\nactive efforts to provide regional security, liberalize \r\ntrade regulations, encourage transit through inter-State \r\nroad and rail routes and deal with other issues are not \r\nenough. Resolving border issues has to be a major \r\nfactor in regional stability.\r\nUnfortunately, situations today in which individual \r\nStates attempt to pursue their own development at other \r\ncountries’ expense and limit their opportunities are \r\nbecoming more common. We believe that such trends \r\nshould have no place in the modern civilized world. In \r\norder to truly protect the right to development, it is vital \r\nthat we ensure that powerful States and transnational \r\ncorporations do not dictate conditions, limit other \r\ncountries’ development, hinder the implementation \r\nof effective projects or, especially, interfere in their \r\ninternal affairs. In a civilized world no one should \r\nprevent development for some States in order to \r\nencourage it in others. We believe that any international \r\ncooperation should be based on the principles of mutual \r\nbenefit and respect for each other’s interests. In order \r\nto achieve that, we believe it is vital to strengthen \r\ninternational law on the right of States to development.\r\nThe issue of the relationship between water and \r\npower in Central Asia deserves special attention. As we \r\nknow, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, processes \r\nin Central Asia began to disintegrate. Mutually agreed-\r\non arrangements for exchanging water and energy \r\nresources collapsed. Despite that, the Kyrgyz Republic \r\nhas continued to accumulate water in its reservoirs at \r\na time when prices of energy resources supplied by \r\nneighbouring countries have been increasing every \r\nyear. Frankly, it has been a game with only one set \r\nof goalposts. In the circumstances, Kyrgyzstan has \r\nbeen obliged to switch to producing affordable, clean \r\nelectrical power through its hydroelectric plants in \r\norder to provide its people with heat and electricity. \r\nWe still have electricity shortages, especially in winter. \r\nWithin the framework of its existing relationships, \r\nKyrgyzstan, with its considerable reserves of fresh \r\nwater, is not adequately compensated economically for \r\nthe services it renders through its accumulation and \r\nstorage of water resources that are important to the \r\nentire region.\r\nIn that connection, we believe that the countries of \r\nCentral Asia should come to a unified understanding \r\nof the meaning and significance of our complex \r\nuse of water and energy resources. Today the region \r\npossesses considerable potential when it comes to \r\nachieving a transition to clean energy. Implementing \r\nconstruction projects for hydropower stations in \r\nKyrgyzstan and Tajikistan could meet the energy \r\nneeds of every country in the region and thereby create \r\nfavourable conditions for our sustainable development, \r\nwhile being fully consistent with the provisions of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 7 regarding affordable, \r\nclean energy.\r\nAnother important factor in Central Asia’s \r\nregional stability is finding ways to achieve the speedy \r\nsettlement of border issues based on the principles and \r\nnorms of international law. We call for using exclusively \r\npolitical and diplomatic means to resolve current \r\nregional problems peacefully, in accordance with the \r\nprinciples of international law, mutual understanding \r\nand compromise, without the use or threat of use of \r\nforce. For its part, Kyrgyzstan remains open to dialogue \r\nand cooperation with all interested parties.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in our combined \r\nopposition to today’s challenges and threats has grown \r\nenormously. However, alongside the Organization’s \r\ngrowing importance, its responsibility for taking \r\ndecisions on the fate of the entire world community has \r\nalso grown. For all practical purposes, the 15 members \r\nof the Security Council currently make decisions about \r\nthe security issues of every country on the planet. \r\nQuestions of war and peace, security and stability \r\nin every corner of the world depend on the positions \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n44/52 16-29811\r\nthey collectively arrive at. On top of that, the five \r\npermanent members of the Security Council can block \r\nany decision.\r\nIn that regard, we believe that reform of the primary \r\ninternational organ of the United Nations, which should \r\ntake into account the interests of a much larger majority \r\nof States, is long overdue. When the Organization was \r\ncreated and the founding Member States numbered only \r\n50, limiting the membership of the Security Council to \r\n15 was justified. But now there are 193 Member States. \r\nWe believe that the expansion of democracy should \r\nnot be confined to States’ national borders. The time \r\nhas come to introduce democratic principles into the \r\nelection of members of the main organs of the United \r\nNations, including the Security Council.\r\nWe should also reform the process for selecting the \r\nSecretary-General. We welcome the procedural changes \r\nwhereby, for the first time in the Organization’s 71-year \r\nhistory, all Member States have had the opportunity \r\nahead of time to get to know the candidates for that \r\nimportant position, and their proposed programmes, \r\nduring consultations. However, we should not stop \r\nthere. We are in favour of introducing direct elections \r\nfor the post of Secretary-General through a vote in the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI would like to bring up another problem here. \r\nFrom 20 to 23 September, the Office for Democratic \r\nInstitutions and Human Rights (ODIHR) of the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\n(OSCE) provided a platform for the claims of Kadyrzhan \r\nBatyrov, who has been convicted by the Supreme Court \r\nof the Kyrgyz Republic and sentenced in absentia to life \r\nimprisonment for the serious crimes of organizing and \r\nfomenting inter-ethnic strife in 2010. In 2013 he was \r\nalso cited by the Russian Federation in connection with \r\nan investigation of large-scale fraud. Kyrgyzstan and \r\nthe OSCE have cooperated in achieving many brilliant \r\nsuccesses. However, the ODIHR policy is fomenting a \r\nconflict that could lead to a destabilizing situation and \r\nunpredictable consequences in our country.\r\nWe are a country that has laboured to begin the \r\nprocess of building parliamentary democracy. We \r\nhave strictly and scrupulously abided by all the OSCE \r\nand ODIHR recommendations, and will continue to \r\ndo so. We believe that the aforementioned actions of \r\nthe ODIHR represent a sign of extreme disrespect not \r\nonly for a State’s judicial system but also to the entire \r\npeople of Kyrgyzstan. We can only see it as a challenge \r\nto the Kyrgyz Republic as it treads the thorny, difficult \r\npath towards building a genuine democracy. In this \r\nway, the annual meetings of ODIHR could become a \r\nplatform where criminal elements who have committed \r\nvery serious crimes have the right to speak. If ODIHR \r\nacts this way with regard to Kyrgyzstan and other \r\ncountries today, it is possible that in future it could \r\nsee representatives of the terrorists of the Islamic \r\nState, soaked in the blood of their horrific crimes \r\nagainst humanity, participating in its efforts. The \r\nKyrgyz Republic fully shares the democratic values \r\nof the OSCE, and we act to uphold them. However, \r\nwe categorically reject double standards and the \r\ntransformation of that organization into an institution \r\nof provocation and intervention into the domestic \r\naffairs of sovereign States.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm our \r\nconviction that the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and the Paris climate agreement \r\nshould remain a top priority in the international \r\ncommunity’s coordinated initiatives. We must ensure \r\nthat no one be left behind, and especially not the \r\nmountainous landlocked developing countries. We \r\nmust vanquish the destructive forces of terrorism \r\nand extremism, which undermine peace and stability \r\nthroughout the world. In this matter, we need the full \r\ncooperation of leading world Powers. They should also \r\nstop imposing sanctions on each other, as that affects \r\nother countries. \r\nThe role of the United Nations in our joint efforts \r\nto counter contemporary challenges and threats is \r\nbecoming increasingly significant. We call for full \r\nsupport for and a strengthening of our Organization \r\nto collectively address global challenges to advance \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Emmanuel Issoze-Ngondet, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, International Cooperation and Regional \r\nIntegration of the Gabonese Republic.\r\nMr. Issoze-Ngondet (Gabon) (spoke in French): \r\nI would like to begin by conveying my warm \r\ncongratulations to the President on his brilliant \r\nelection to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session. He can be assured of the \r\nGabonese delegation’s full support and cooperation \r\nthroughout his tenure. Allow me to also commend the \r\nremarkable work of his predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, whose efforts enabled us to \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 45/52\r\nbring new momentum to the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, adopted a \r\nyear ago.\r\nSince then, major events have taken place throughout \r\nthe world in the areas of politics, the environment, \r\neconomics and security. As regards politics, this \r\nmeeting comes in the wake of a disputed presidential \r\nelection in my country. The final results, which were \r\nannounced last night, confirmed the re-election of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba as President of the \r\nRepublic and Head of State. I would like to take the \r\nopportunity to express the gratitude of the Government \r\nand people of Gabon to the friendly countries who stood \r\nwith us. I thank the entire international community \r\nfor its support during this very sensitive time in the \r\nhistory of Gabon. In order to ensure credible elections \r\nthat could deliver results acceptable to all political \r\nactors, the Government sought to implement specific \r\nconfidence-building and transparency measures. On its \r\ninitiative, the Parliament passed the law establishing the \r\nuse of biometrics in the procedures used in preparing \r\nthe electoral roll.\r\nThe President of the Republic wanted the election \r\nto be free, transparent and open. To that end, the \r\nGovernment invited over 1,200 observers and \r\naccredited over 200 foreign journalists. Thus, many \r\nelectoral observer missions, both international and \r\nsubregional, were deployed throughout the country. \r\nNotwithstanding all these guarantees, the \r\nprovisional results of the vote made public by the \r\nMinistry of the Interior were challenged, sometimes \r\nwith unprecedented violence, which unfortunately \r\nresulted in serious incidents, including the deplorable \r\nloss of human lives. The turmoil that this caused at the \r\nnational and international levels ref lected the gravity \r\nof the situation. In accordance with legal procedures, \r\nappeals were submitted to the competent judicial body, \r\nthe Constitutional Court. It was the job of the Court, \r\nwhose decisions cannot be appealed, to confirm or \r\noverturn the provisional results. The Court issued its \r\nverdict last night, in which it confirmed the re-election \r\nof President Ali Bongo Ondimba.\r\nTaking stock of the situation, President Ali \r\nBongo Ondimba has called for an inclusive dialogue, \r\nreconciliation and unity. Restoring social cohesion and \r\nnational unity is the current priority. Maintaining the \r\ncountry’s peace and stability is the other challenge we \r\nface. My delegation therefore calls on the international \r\ncommunity to support it in this effort, with the ultimate \r\ngoal of strengthening the rule of law, democracy and \r\ngood governance. In this respect, we will strengthen \r\npolitical and economic governance. The bodies \r\nresponsible for preventing and settling conflicts \r\nnationally — the National Council for Democracy and \r\nthe Mediator of the Republic — will be provided with \r\nsubstantial resources that will enable them to fulfil \r\ntheir mandates.\r\nI would like to pay a strong and well-deserved \r\ntribute to those partners of Gabon, both bilateral and \r\nmultilateral, who stood beside us before, during and \r\nafter the election. I am thinking of France, the United \r\nStates, Morocco and many other friendly countries \r\nin Africa and throughout world that spared no \r\nefforts in that regard. I am thinking, of course, of the \r\nUnited Nations, the African Union, the International \r\nOrganization of la Francophonie, the European Union \r\nand many other partners, to which I would like to \r\nconvey our unending gratitude.\r\nOther major events deserve our attention. They \r\ninclude the widely praised diplomatic rapprochement \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba. It is my hope that \r\nthe thawing of relations between these two countries \r\nwill lead to the lifting of the economic embargo. I would \r\nalso mention the twenty-first session of the Conference \r\nof the Parties (COP 21) to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, in Paris. The entire \r\nworld was pleased to see the signing of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change on 12 December 2015. \r\nThanks to the clear determination of all the countries \r\nthat took part in this important meeting, the success was \r\ncommensurate with our expectations. Gabon, strongly \r\ncommitted to countering global warming, made its \r\ncontribution. The Paris Agreement is a historic turning \r\npoint in our quest for a more sustainable and caring \r\nworld. It is not an overstatement to say that it is a great \r\nstep forward for humankind. We must now show the \r\nsame determination in implementing it as we did in \r\nreaching it.\r\nI note with great satisfaction that the number of \r\ncountries that have ratified the Agreement is growing. \r\nI welcome the remarkable momentum building in the \r\ninternational community, and I would like to believe \r\nthat the Agreement will enter into force between now \r\nand the twenty-second session of the Conference of \r\nthe Parties (COP 22) to the Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change. As far as Gabon is concerned, we \r\nhave already begun the process of ratification. We will \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n46/52 16-29811\r\ndo our utmost to deposit our instrument of ratification \r\nas soon as possible.\r\nIt is difficult today to speak of the results of \r\nCOP 21 without mentioning the challenges facing the \r\ntwenty-second session. COP 22 is seen as an extension \r\nof COP 21. It will be held in Morocco, with a central \r\nfocus on the issue of energy development in Africa. \r\nTwo thirds of Africans are without electricity — an \r\ninjustice that we must mobilize to remedy. It is time \r\nto apply ourselves jointly to the realization of all \r\nof our intitiatives and all our announced agendas. \r\nGabon welcomes the mobilization of Morocco and \r\nits commitment to the success of COP 22, especially \r\nin view of the parties’ envisaged adoption of urgent \r\nmeasures within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. That goes to show the value \r\nthat Gabon attaches to environmental issues, which are \r\nat the heart of the Agenda and which we adopted at the \r\nseventieth session of the General Assembly in this very \r\nHall.\r\nAt a time when we are rocked by economic, \r\nsocial and political crises, the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) represents \r\ntoday a new push to transform our world. It is therefore \r\nimportant that the enthusiasm surrounding the adoption \r\nof the 2030 Agenda be reflected in action in order \r\nto accelerate its implementation. That is the major \r\nchallenge the international community will face over \r\nthe coming years.\r\nThe poverty eradication, conservation of the \r\nenvironment and sharing of prosperity to which \r\nwe all aspire are requirements that call for a greater \r\nmobilization of human and financial resources, together \r\nwith increased involvement on the part of the private \r\nsector. I mention the mobilization of human resources \r\nbecause people must remain at the centre of our policies \r\nand actions. For that reason, the involvement of all \r\nactors is more than critical. By “actors”, I mean young \r\npeople, women, persons with disabilities, refugees, \r\nmigrants, civil society and the private sector. \r\nThe mobilization of financial resources is needed \r\nbecause the implementation of the SDGs requires \r\nthat we meet a whole set of needs. We must therefore \r\nredouble our creativity and find new sources of \r\nfinancing, so as not to repeat the errors associated with \r\nthe implementation of Millennium Development Goals. \r\nThe private sector needs to be mobilized and involved \r\nbecause it plays a key role with regard to productivity, \r\neconomic growth, job creation and wealth creation. It \r\nis therefore time for the private sector to play a larger \r\nrole in tackling the challenges linked to sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nI wish to reassure everybody that Gabon will \r\ncontinue its unflagging efforts when it comes \r\nto tackling the problems posed by sustainable \r\ndevelopment and finding new ways of managing our \r\neconomies. In that regard, our Government created \r\nthe Investment and Export Promotion Agency, which \r\nis required to come up with harmonious strategies to \r\nimprove our business climate and to implement strict \r\nand appropriate management methods with regard to \r\nour natural resources. The Agency is also responsible \r\nfor designing and implementing a sectoral approach \r\nthat focuses on initial processing at the local level and \r\nrational management of our environment. We felt it was \r\nnecessary to modify our traditional economic approach \r\nby integrating into it a new, sustainable balance between \r\nour people and our environment and also a space-time \r\ndimension with respect to development. That approach \r\nis designed to address the growing gap between poor \r\nand rich and to anticipate and avert the consequences, \r\nfor the environment and for future generations, of \r\npoorly controlled or uncontrolled growth.\r\nAs, I think, everyone will agree, if we are to fulfil \r\nour commitments in respect of sustainable development \r\nand tackling climate change, we need a peaceful society. \r\nFor that reason my country approves any initiative that \r\nwill ensure peace and security within our borders, in \r\nthe subregion of Central Africa, and throughout the \r\nentire world. The concept of peace is a constant that has \r\nalways characterized the experience of the people of \r\nGabon. Hence, Gabon actively participates in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism, which operates in various parts of \r\nthe world indiscriminately. The presence of Gabon at \r\nthe Second Regional Security Summit for Africa, held \r\nin Abuja in May, is proof of our commitment to a world \r\nwithout terrorism. The decline in the activities of Boko \r\nHaram in the Chad Basin prove that the synergy of our \r\nefforts is paying off.\r\nThe fight against an enemy that is asymmetrical \r\nis far from having been won. Despite increased \r\ncooperation and significant resources deployed on \r\nthe ground, and although we have raised our levels of \r\nalertness and added to the capabilities of our special \r\nforces, small terrorist groups are proving to be resilient \r\nand are displaying an unprecedented capacity for doing \r\nharm. \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 47/52\r\nIn both Syria and Iraq, the so-called Islamic \r\nState — in spite of being weakened — still has \r\nsufficient financial and technical means to challenge \r\nthe international coalition. We must, therefore, do all \r\nwe can to deplete its sources of supply.\r\nIf we are to overcome the terrorist threat, we must \r\nfirst resolve the conflicts in Libya and Syria. I need \r\nhardly remind those present that the current chaos \r\nhas become fertile ground for the nebulous terrorists \r\nto operate and to expand their destabilizing activities. \r\nThe migratory crisis, which is unprecedented, is also \r\nbeing stoked by the conflicts in Libya and Syria. \r\nAs we have repeatedly said, the only alternative to \r\nthese crises is a political solution arrived at through \r\nnegotiation. Any military solution should be in keeping \r\nwith that approach.\r\nPoaching and trafficking of all types also constitute \r\nthreats to our collective peace and security. My country \r\nwelcomes the second General Assembly resolution \r\nto tackle poaching (resolution 70/301), adopted on \r\n9 September 2016. My country is particularly concerned \r\nabout the lack of progress in the general and complete \r\ndisarmament process, as it is about the paralysis of the \r\nmultilateral disarmament mechanisms. The resumption \r\nof work requires that all Member States recommit \r\ntheir efforts. Maintaining the status quo is not a \r\nviable solution.\r\nThe prevailing and persistent impasse in the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian peace process is also not viable. The lack \r\nof constructive dialogue serves neither the cause of \r\nIsrael’s security nor that of bringing about a stable and \r\nprosperous Palestinian State. On the contrary, it serves \r\nonly to heighten tensions, distrust and insecurity. We \r\nbelieve that any lasting solution that is acceptable to \r\nall has to emerge from direct negotiations between \r\nthe concerned parties, not from unilateral approaches. \r\nWe reaffirm Gabon’s support for France’s proposal \r\nregarding the convening of a conference, before the \r\nyear’s end, at which the Israelis and the Palestinians \r\nwould be able to resume negotiations.\r\nAs for Moroccan Sahara, there is still the option of \r\na negotiated political solution. In my view, it is the best \r\nway forward if we are to break the deadlock that has \r\nbeen in place for several years. My country reiterates its \r\nsupport for the Moroccan initiative, which we believe \r\nis realistic and capable of leading, under the aegis of \r\nthe United Nations, to a lasting settlement of that issue.\r\nIn closing, allow me to pay a heartfelt tribute to \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, whose mandate is \r\ncoming to an end. I thank him for his tireless and constant \r\nefforts to uphold the noble aims of the Organization \r\nand for the many initiatives he has led with a view \r\nto realizing the projects and ambitions of the United \r\nNations for the world. I thank him for everything he \r\nhas done during the ten years he has spent at the helm \r\nof our Secretariat. On behalf of Gabon, my delegation \r\nwelcomes the reforms he has brought about in our \r\nOrganization, which will undoubtedly have a lasting \r\nimpact on the world. It thanks him for his leadership \r\non issues as important as climate change, migration \r\nf lows, humanitarian assistance, questions of peace and \r\nsecurity, and the reform of the Security Council.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Francine Baron, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nCARICOM Affairs of the Commonwealth of Dominica.\r\nMs. Baron (Dominica): Last year, when this body \r\nmet, we resolved collectively to take global action to \r\ntransform our world in a manner that would bring about \r\nsustainable and equitable development. The adoption \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), has \r\nset the stage for increasing international discourse \r\nand action in our fight against inequality, to combat \r\nclimate change, to empower our citizens, to protect the \r\nvulnerable and to improve the lives of billions of people \r\nacross the globe.\r\nToday, Dominica, like other small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS), remains motivated and \r\ncommitted to achieving the SDGs. For my country, \r\nthe realization of the SDGs is not simply about ticking \r\nboxes. Fundamentally, it is about making a real and \r\nmeaningful difference in the lives of our citizens. \r\nHowever, in order for those essential changes to take \r\nplace, we must each do more at the national level, and \r\nall countries must deliver on their commitments in \r\naccordance with their respective means. That effort \r\nwill require more structured and effective partnerships.\r\nAdditionally, as we focus our minds on the SDGs, \r\nwe must also sharpen our focus on the impact that \r\nclimate change continues to have on the development \r\nof SIDS. In the past few years, we have witnessed a \r\ndramatic reduction in agricultural production. We are \r\nalso experiencing more severe and prolonged droughts, \r\noften followed by sudden and high volumes of rainfall, \r\nwhich result in massive soil erosion and catastrophic \r\nloss and damage.\r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n48/52 16-29811\r\nLikewise, the ongoing phenomenon of beach erosion \r\nand destruction of coral reefs — so vital to our tourism \r\nproduct and the character of our islands — risks untold \r\ndamage to our prized tourism assets. Consequently, \r\nthe economic impact on SIDS is dire. More urgent \r\nand wide-ranging action is needed in the fight against \r\nclimate change to ensure our very survival. To that end, \r\nwe look forward to building on the momentum of the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change as we move on \r\nto the twenty-second session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, to be held in Marrakesh later \r\nthis year.\r\nAs many will recall, a little over a year ago the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica was painfully reminded \r\nof the devastating impact of climate change. In less \r\nthan 24 hours, Tropical Storm Erika took the lives of \r\n30 Dominicans and wreaked havoc on our country’s \r\nphysical and social infrastructure. That single climatic \r\nevent caused damage estimated at EC$1.3 billion, or \r\n$483 million, which accounted for 90 per cent of the \r\nisland’s gross domestic product.\r\nOne year on, we are making great strides and are \r\non track to build back better and to build increasingly \r\nclimate-resilient and adaptive infrastructure. While we \r\ncommend the Dominicans— at home and abroad — for \r\ntheir support and dedication, our progress has been \r\nmade easier through the partnership and support of \r\nour bilateral and multilateral partners. We therefore \r\ntake this opportunity to thank them publicly for their \r\ninvaluable contribution to our rebuilding efforts.\r\nI can say that Dominica’s experience with Tropical \r\nStorm Erika is all too common in the lives of SIDS. \r\nWe continue to suffer the disproportionate burden \r\nand impact of climate change, which also severely \r\nundermines our efforts at sustainable development. \r\nAlso troubling are the slow-onset events and the \r\nextreme weather events that are brought on as a result \r\nof climate change. These are expected to become more \r\nfrequent and more destructive. What that means for us, \r\nin real terms, is that limited resources, which should be \r\ntargeted at transformative and sustainable development, \r\nof necessity have to be continuously shifted to post-\r\ndisaster rehabilitation.\r\nThat is why Dominica continues its call for \r\ncollaboration in the establishment of an international \r\nnatural disaster risk fund, to provide timely financial \r\nsupport to SIDS affected by natural disasters. The \r\ncurrent Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility within the \r\nCaribbean Development Bank for Caribbean SIDS, \r\nthe International Monetary Fund’s support for disaster \r\nrecovery and the World Bank’s Global Facility for \r\nDisaster Reduction and Recovery are good starting \r\npoints. Regrettably, in the face of the enormous \r\nchallenge, their funding levels remain vastly insufficient. \r\nWe would be encouraged if the capitalization of this \r\nspecial natural disaster risk fund were to come from \r\nthe parties to annex I of the Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change and other major emitters, including \r\nvoluntary contributors. We believe that such a facility \r\nwould enable SIDS to access and secure funds in a \r\nmore predictable and timely manner and to rebuild \r\nmore robust infrastructure through effective technical \r\nassistance and physical development planning. It would \r\nalso help these climate-vulnerable countries to build \r\nincreasingly climate-resilient economies and to identify \r\nvulnerable areas that need to be adapted and mitigated \r\nto better deal with any future catastrophic event.\r\nThe Government of Dominica is also taking \r\neffective steps at the national level to improve its ability \r\nto respond and deliver in post-disaster situations. \r\nThis year, Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit outlined \r\na proposal to establish a national vulnerability risk \r\nand resilience fund. The fund aims to ensure that \r\nthe Government has immediate access to financial \r\nresources in the event of a natural disaster. The fund \r\nwould also be used to finance climate-resilient projects \r\nand programmes. The capitalization of the fund will \r\ncome from Government revenue and returns from the \r\nGovernment’s investments in renewable energy projects \r\nthat have already been implemented with grants and \r\nconcessionary financing through the Green Climate \r\nFund. Two projects have already been identified: the \r\ngeothermal energy project and a national waste-to-\r\nenergy project.\r\nToday’s interconnectedness of global markets make \r\naccess to the global financial system a prerequisite \r\nto economic development and a sine qua non for \r\nsustainable development. The free movement of goods \r\nand services depends on the ability of the public and \r\nprivate sectors to move financial resources throughout \r\nthe world. Therefore, recent actions taken by several \r\ninternational banks in the United States and across \r\nEurope to terminate correspondent banking relations \r\nwith indigenous banks in the Caribbean have made it \r\ndifficult for the Caribbean to do business with the rest \r\nof the world. The consequences are far-reaching. It has \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 49/52\r\naffected the transmission of remittances, undermined \r\nforeign investments, restricted the repatriation of profits \r\nand restricted our national and indigenous banks’ ability \r\nto participate effectively in the international financial \r\nsystems, even though they have not been found guilty \r\nof any financial or security breaches.\r\nThe Governments of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) have long recognized and supported the \r\nneed for common global action against the financing of \r\nterrorism, money laundering, organized crime and other \r\nillegal activities. Our countries have worked diligently \r\nwith non-regional Governments and international \r\ninstitutions like the Financial Action Task Force on \r\nMoney Laundering and the Caribbean Financial Action \r\nTask Force and have instituted domestic legislation \r\nto fight money laundering, restrict the financing of \r\nterrorism and seize the proceeds of crime.\r\nOur leaders acknowledge that the de-risking \r\nof correspondent banks is a direct response to the \r\nregulatory requirements imposed by those jurisdictions \r\nin which they operate. We want to see action to remedy \r\nits harmful effects on us. The unintended consequences \r\nthreaten our very economic survival. The solution lies, \r\nwe believe, in meaningful dialogue between and among \r\nStates. Through dialogue, we hope to see the creation \r\nof rules-based standards and mechanisms that govern \r\nthe establishment and maintenance of correspondent \r\nbanking relationships and regulatory changes under \r\nwhich the respondent banks, instead of correspondent \r\nbanks, would be sanctioned for violations in connection \r\nwith anti-money laundering and combating the \r\nfinancing of terrorism, thereby removing the burden of \r\ncompliance from the latter.\r\nLike most challenges of global magnitude, that \r\ncalls for strong international partnerships. One such \r\npartnership is the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of \r\nAction (SAMOA) Pathway, which we believe presents a \r\nblueprint for such modalities. It also highlights durable \r\nand genuine partnerships as a cornerstone for achieving \r\nthe SDGs in SIDS. Additionally, we believe that South-\r\nSouth, North-South and Triangular cooperation have \r\nserved and will continue to serve as an effective \r\nplatform for technology transfer and capacity-building. \r\nWe thank our developed country partners, which \r\ncontinue to play a major role in our development and \r\nin our efforts to realize the SDGs. Over the years, \r\nthose countries have stood steadfastly with us in \r\nour commitment to improve the lives of our people. \r\nAssistance with developing sustainable agriculture, \r\ntourism and energy, especially with geothermal energy \r\ndevelopment, have set the platform for sustainable \r\nsocial and economic development, while at the same \r\ntime combating climate change.\r\nWe strongly believe, however, that an effective \r\nstrategy to realize the SDGs will require an overhaul \r\nof the manner in which official development assistance \r\n(ODA) is executed. ODA must be more informed by the \r\nrealities in the recipient countries, more predictable, \r\nand accessible in a timely manner. For instance, the very \r\nunrealistic and arbitrary classification of several small \r\nisland developing States as middle-income countries, \r\nbased on the f lawed notion of gross domestic product \r\nper capita, is yet another way in which the efforts of \r\nsmall countries at building economic resilience and \r\nsustainable development are systematically undermined. \r\nIt is a tendency that completely obscures the reality \r\nin SIDS and ignores their inherent characteristics of \r\nvulnerability. We will continue to draw attention to the \r\nunsuitability of those categorizations.\r\nAt the same time, SIDS will continue to explore \r\nopportunities within the framework of South-South \r\ncooperation. We have recently been encouraged by the \r\nincreasing levels of partnership among and between \r\ncountries of the South. The role of China has become \r\nintegral to South-South cooperation, and China has \r\ndemonstrated its willingness and capacity to assist \r\ndeveloping countries in critical areas of development. \r\nThese have included funding for and the construction \r\nof essential physical infrastructure, as well as providing \r\nassistance in the form of equipment, the delivery of \r\nhealth-care services and human resources development.\r\nEqually, countries such as the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela and Cuba continue to make a durable and \r\nsignificant impact on the health care, education and \r\nenergy landscape of Dominica. Cuba has the capacity to \r\nmake an even greater contribution to our region and the \r\nworld, once the economic embargo is lifted. Dominica \r\nis encouraged by the recent improvement in relations \r\nbetween the Republic of Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica. We applaud President Obama’s initiative as \r\nprogressive and worthy of international support. The \r\ncritical next step, however, should be the removal of \r\nall other impediments to trade and economic activities, \r\nso that Cuba can fully benefit from the international \r\ntrading and financial systems.\r\nEven in the face of its own domestic challenges, \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela continues to be \r\nA/71/PV.20 24/09/2016\r\n50/52 16-29811\r\na reliable partner in development. Our partnership \r\nwith the Bolivarian Republic, especially over the \r\npast decade, has contributed significantly to our \r\nown tangible achievements under the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals through initiatives such as the \r\nBolivarian Alternative for the Peoples of Our America \r\nand the PetroCaribe Energy Cooperation Agreement. \r\nWe look forward to our continued partnership and hope \r\nfor a peaceful and amicable resolution of its current \r\ndifficulties. A peaceful and stable hemisphere is in the \r\ninterest of all of us.\r\nWithin the Caribbean subregion, we continue to \r\nstrengthen and deepen both bilateral and multilateral \r\npartnerships to promote development and our effort \r\nto achieve the SDGs. The role of regional institutions \r\nlike CARICOM and the Organization of Eastern \r\nCaribbean States has become even more essential in \r\nterms of social and economic development. That is why \r\nwe have built institutions that serve the people of our \r\nregion in every aspect of development. Our regional \r\napproach to our common challenges has also garnered \r\nbetter results than if we were to face them individually. \r\nCARICOM now provides a critical interface with our \r\ndevelopment partners in trade, energy, and social and \r\neconomic development.\r\nIn the area of energy, CARICOM has adopted \r\nand is currently implementing the Caribbean \r\nSustainable Energy Roadmap and Strategy. The goal \r\nof the Roadmap and Strategy is to transform the energy \r\nsectors of the member States by providing secure and \r\nsustainable supplies of clean, reliable and affordable \r\nenergy with stable prices in order to better position the \r\nCaribbean Community to achieve the SDGs. As a result, \r\nCARICOM has been partnering with other countries \r\nand organizations, both formally and informally, to \r\nassist its members. \r\nOne such partnership exists with the Government \r\nof Austria, the United Nations Industrial Development \r\nOrganization and the SIDS Sustainable Energy and \r\nClimate Resilience Initiative to create the Caribbean \r\nCentre for Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency. \r\nThe Centre will serve as a hub for coordinating \r\nCaribbean-wide renewable energy and energy efficiency \r\nprogrammes. We expect it to play a major role in the \r\nimplementation of the CARICOM energy policies.\r\nGiven its paramount importance to the future \r\nprosperity and sustainable development of the SIDS, I \r\nwould like brief ly to highlight SDG 14, which refers to \r\nprotection of our seas, oceans and marine resources. \r\nThe world’s oceans and seas are sources of nourishment \r\nand nutrition to billions, a major tourism asset and an \r\nimportant part of our complex ecosystem. International \r\nactions to protect the health of our oceans and seas \r\nshould be pursued as a matter of urgency. Small and \r\nlarge countries should come together to coordinate \r\nefforts and to create a system to regulate activities that \r\naffect our oceans and seas.\r\nWe commend the efforts and initiatives taken by \r\nthe Friends of the Oceans group, the Government of \r\nItaly and, most recently, United States Secretary of \r\nState John Kerry. The recent Our Ocean Conference \r\nin Washington, D.C., like its predecessors, highlighted \r\nthe need to draw greater attention to the ongoing \r\ndestruction of our oceans resulting from marine \r\npollution and its implications for humankind. We need \r\ninnovative and global responses. We must also improve \r\npublic awareness and education on marine pollution \r\nand highlight the best practices to protect our oceans.\r\nIn that regard, we commend the efforts of \r\nrepresentatives and countries advancing the We Are \r\nThe Oceans concept. Dominica is happy to associate \r\nwith this initiative, which promotes food security, \r\nsustainable consumption and production, ocean \r\nconservation and biodiversity as a way to meet, or even \r\nexceed, the commitments made by our leaders. We \r\nare The Oceans holds great potential for making the \r\nissue of our seas and oceans one of the most extensive \r\neducational initiatives of the SDGs. We urge Member \r\nStates to join and to work collectively to save our planet \r\nfor future generations. Collectively, we have the ability \r\nto solve the most difficult challenges of our time\r\nThe unprecedented pace of human advancement in \r\nthe twenty-first century has demonstrated that we have \r\nthe capacity and ingenuity to combat climate change \r\nand to develop means of production and consumption to \r\nsustain humankind, while at the same time protecting \r\nour planet. \r\nOur efforts to save our planet and to improve the \r\nlives of billions of people throughout the world — people \r\nwho suffer from hunger and starvation and those \r\nwho continue to be marginalized — will be pointless \r\nwithout peace and security. The destruction wrought \r\nby wars within and between countries continues to \r\ndisplace millions of people from their homes, creating \r\nan unprecedented refugee crisis.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.20\r\n16-29811 51/52\r\nThe threat posed by nuclear weapons, and \r\nespecially by the determination of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to develop weapons with \r\nthe ability to kill millions, is a major threat not only to \r\nthe neighbours of the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea but to people everywhere. The United Nations \r\nmust, without hesitation, take strong and decisive \r\naction to pursue diplomatic solutions to end the war \r\nin Syria and to eliminate the nuclear capability of the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea. Similarly, we \r\nmust, as a matter of urgency, work together to defeat \r\nthe increasing threat of global terrorism. It is up to us \r\nto take the necessary actions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.45 p.m.\r\n"
