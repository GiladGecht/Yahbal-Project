I also wish to \r\ncommend him for choosing a theme that resonates very \r\nwell among Member States and partners. The theme, \r\n“The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push \r\nto transform our world”, strongly reaffirms the raison \r\nd’être of the United Nations.\r\nThe Philippines is one of the founding Members \r\nof the Organization. For more than seven decades, our \r\nengagement and partnership with the United Nations \r\nhas been a riveting story of our aspirations as a people, \r\nborn of our colonial past and our independent present. \r\nWith its central and strategic role, the United Nations \r\nremains a relevant and important platform where all \r\nnations can make that decisive push to empower us all \r\nto achieve and sustain our development agenda, which \r\nhas the interests of our peoples at its core.\r\nToday, the Philippines is once again privileged to \r\nrenew its commitment to the cause of peace, security \r\nand sustainable development through key priority \r\nareas and advocacies identified in the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. The global action to \r\ntransform our world illuminates the urgency and \r\nimportance of our efforts in the Philippines to explore \r\nnew horizons and break new ground, anchored in our \r\nunremitting commitment as a democracy to the rule \r\nof law and the well-being of our sovereign people and \r\nto our desire to remain a responsible partner in the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe guiding principles and core values enshrined in \r\nthe Constitution of the Philippines include the sanctity \r\nof human life, the inalienable rights of each person, the \r\nsupremacy of the law, freedom, equality, peace, justice \r\nand the nation’s right to self-determination. Among the \r\ncountry’s mandates is the pursuit of an independent \r\nforeign policy designed to promote national interests. \r\nWith our hard-fought and hard-won independence, \r\nwe have valued and zealously guarded our rights and \r\nliberties. To prevent abuse and unwanted excesses, \r\nthe checks and balances of our democratic institutions \r\nare actively at play. They range  from the three highly \r\nindependent branches of government — the Supreme \r\nCourt, the Congress and the Executive Branch — to the \r\nopen and free press and civil society groups committed \r\nto guaranteeing the freedom and prosperity of \r\nevery Filipino.\r\nThose fundamental and time-honoured principles \r\nand values give rise to the solemn duty of our people \r\nto choose their leaders. In turn, the Government has \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Reneging on that responsibility places \r\nthe Government at risk of being removed by popular \r\ninitiatives, including People Power —- a glorious event \r\nin the Philippines that is admired and remembered \r\naround the world.\r\nFive months ago, our people, through our nation’s \r\ndemocratic principles and processes, elected a new \r\nleader. President Rodrigo Roa Duterte triumphed in \r\nthe democratic elections with an unprecedented and \r\nresounding electoral mandate. The Filipino people, \r\nproud of their democratic values, traditions and \r\nheritage, have spoken. Their vote is an unmistakable \r\ncall for a deepening of our democracy, where our \r\npeople will truly be liberated from the shackles of fear, \r\nconflict, poverty and injustice. Their choice represents \r\nthe expressed wish of the people to revitalize the entire \r\ncountry as a sovereign equal among the community \r\nof nations. Their sacred ballots cast an unequivocal \r\nand resounding voice for change and for tearing down \r\nantiquated political and economic structures that \r\nhave continued to generate and perpetuate numerous \r\ninequalities. They voted for the renewal of our \r\ncommunities and our society, for a life of constancy, \r\ndignity and honour.\r\nIn his address to the nation, President Duterte \r\ndeclared that the rule of law and the respect for due \r\nprocess will prevail at all times. Clearly, we will be \r\nguided by established norms and procedures under \r\nthe law to deliver on the strong mandate given to the \r\nPresident by the Filipino electorate. \r\nFor far too long, the Philippines has been unable \r\nto fully advance because of corruption in high and \r\nlow places, the worsening crime situation and the \r\nprevalence of illegal drugs. Our people recognize the \r\nperil that those evils pose to our development and \r\nour democracy. Corruption has become the breeding \r\nground for the illegal drug trade, which seriously \r\nthreatens the country’s peace and order. Furthermore, \r\ncorruption impedes our sustainable development goals. \r\nIt has torn apart many of our communities, destroyed \r\nfamilies and snuffed out the hopes and dreams of our \r\npeople, young and old, for a bright future. For that \r\nreason, we are determined to free the Philippines from \r\ncorrupt and other outdated practices as we eradicate \r\nillicit drugs and their manufacture, distribution and \r\nuse in the country. The rule of law and strict adherence \r\nto due process fully governs our campaign against \r\ncorruption and criminality, including the fight against \r\nillegal drugs.\r\nOur firm belief in the supremacy of the law is given \r\nconcrete expression through the State policy, enshrined \r\nin the Constitution, to fully respect human rights and \r\nthe value and dignity of every person. We even have \r\nan independent Human Rights Commission tasked to \r\ninvestigate and prosecute all human rights violations \r\nin the country. That national commitment is amplified \r\ninternationally, as the Philippines is party to eight of \r\nthe nine core international human rights conventions. \r\nWe recognize that a secure, stable, and prosperous \r\nPhilippines will require a secure and stable rules-based \r\ninternational order to which it must faithfully comply.\r\nWith the imperative to forge policies for our people \r\naimed at achieving enduring peace and prosperity and \r\nat restoring trust in the Government’s ability to protect \r\ntheir fundamental rights and freedoms, the President, \r\ngoing into his third month in office, enjoys a 92 per cent \r\nrate of approval and trust from the Filipino people. To \r\nhim, that trust is sacrosanct; under no circumstances \r\ncan it be breached, under no circumstance must it \r\nbe compromised.\r\nOur actions have, however, grabbed both national \r\nheadlines and international attention for all the wrong \r\nreasons. Consequently, we urge everyone to allow us to \r\ndeal with our domestic challenges so that we can achieve \r\nour national goals without undue interference and so \r\nthat we can be among the community of nations that \r\ncan collectively make a universal push to transform our \r\nworld and improve the quality of life for all of humanity, \r\nincluding the more than 100 million Filipinos. We urge \r\neveryone to have faith in the strong institutions of our \r\ndemocracy and in our people to defend the freedom and \r\nintegrity of our country, and in the power of our people \r\nas they continue to freely participate, be involved \r\nand have a say in the actions and decisions of their \r\ndemocratically elected Government.\r\nLet me repeat, explicitly and unequivocally, that \r\nthe Philippines is committed to the rule of law and \r\nthe protection of the rights of all Filipinos. With that \r\nabiding commitment, we are pursuing our efforts \r\nwithin the existing democratic and legal framework, \r\nwhish is governed by the overriding principle to uphold \r\nthe dignity of every person and the right to due process \r\nand to the presumption of innocence. For the law to be \r\ncredible, respected and effective, it has to be consistent \r\nand fair. The full force of the law will be applied at all \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 3/34\r\ntimes to serve the ends of justice, and not just those \r\nof a select few. There will be no double standard, no \r\napplication of selective justice.\r\nOur campaign to rid the country of criminality, \r\nlawlessness and disorder, including our all-out war \r\nagainst illicit drugs, will remain strictly in accordance \r\nwith the Philippine Constitution and the international \r\nnorms and human rights treaties and covenants that we \r\nare party to. We have not empowered and never will \r\nempower our law-enforcement agents to shoot to kill \r\nindividuals suspected of drug crimes. And yet, under \r\nour established rules of engagement, our police have \r\nthe right to defend themselves when their lives are \r\nthreatened. Extrajudicial killing has no place in our \r\nsociety nor in our criminal justice system.\r\nOur sustainable goals rest on the fundamentals of \r\ndevelopment, that is, human development. The path of \r\nchange that we seek is grounded in the most enduring \r\nof precepts, namely, our own national interest, which \r\naddresses the immediate needs of the Filipino people. \r\nOur goals are guided by our article of faith that we \r\nleave no one behind in our development strides. \r\nWe are working hard to ensure that each and every \r\nFilipino will be able to keep in step with the overall \r\ndevelopment pace.\r\nThe Philippines continues to enhance the delivery \r\nand quality of basic social services to our people, \r\nanchored in the implementation of what we view as a \r\nhuman approach to development and governance. We \r\nhave benchmarked such services to global standards. \r\nThat is true of our health, education, food, water and \r\nhousing services. Environmental preservation, respect \r\nfor culture and the pursuit of social justice form key \r\ncomponents of our national development frameworks.\r\nSince 2013, the Philippines has made public its \r\nsupport for the core pillars of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. The Philippines is honoured \r\nto be one of the 22 pioneer countries that volunteered \r\nat the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment to share its initiatives in the first year of \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nIf we are to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals in 15 years, we need to take a risk-informed \r\napproach. It is axiomatic to say that frequent and intense \r\nnatural disasters can negate our gains in the reduction \r\nof poverty and even push back development.\r\nThe Philippines is one of the most disaster-prone \r\ncountries. It is also vulnerable to the adverse effects \r\nof climate, change owing to many years of neglect and \r\nselfish practices by various countries. This has left us \r\nfar behind in progress, because of their irresponsibility \r\nand greed at our expense. We reiterate our call for \r\nclimate justice and the principle of equity and common \r\nbut differentiated responsibility in the implementation \r\nof the obligations under the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change.\r\nThe Philippines will remain a responsible partner \r\nof the international community. Our domestic concerns \r\ncompel us to partner with like-minded countries in \r\nthe areas of maritime security, counter-terrorism, \r\ndisaster response and transnational crime such as, but \r\nnot limited to, trafficking in drugs and humans. Our \r\ncommitment to the rule of law, peace, our people and \r\nour relations with the international community also \r\nextends to the recent decision of the Arbitral Tribunal of \r\nthe Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague with \r\nregard to disputes in the South China Sea. The decision \r\nhas upheld the primacy of international law as the \r\ncornerstone for a rules-based regional and international \r\norder. The arbitral award, which is final and binding \r\non all parties, is a clearly established legal fact that is \r\nnow part of international jurisprudence in the maritime \r\ndomain, in accordance with the 1982 United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea.\r\nWe reaffirm our abiding commitment to pursue \r\nthe peaceful resolution and management of disputes \r\nwith a view to promoting and enhancing peace and \r\nstability in the region. We need to fully respect legal \r\nand diplomatic processes as we explore the best way \r\nforward. We reaffirm the need to enhance mutual trust \r\nand confidence. We must not overlook the importance \r\nof non-militarization and self-restraint in the conduct \r\nof all activities, including maintaining the freedom of \r\nnavigation, the full and effective implementation of \r\nthe 2002 Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the \r\nSouth China Sea and the adoption of an effective code \r\nof conduct.\r\nOver the past 71 years, the United Nations has \r\ndemonstrated continuing resilience and relevance in the \r\nface of intractable challenges and emerging regional \r\nthreats, both traditional and non-traditional. With the \r\nadoption of the Sustainable Development Goals, the \r\nUnited Nations has rightly returned development to \r\nthe centre of global efforts to pursue peace, security \r\nand stability.\r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n4/34 16-29817\r\nThe Philippines, as a founding Member of the \r\nUnited Nations, walks with and works with the \r\ncommunity of nations in truly transforming our world, \r\nwhere the universal values of equality, tolerance and \r\nhuman dignity must prevail. As we reason together \r\nin this honoured Hall of the United Nations, let us \r\ntogether move our development goals forward. For us \r\nto build our future, we must honour our past. As we \r\nreaffirm our common humanity, we have to keep faith \r\nwith one another as we advance our noblest and highest \r\naspirations based on our collective will and pursue our \r\nvarying and often disparate national interests.\r\nDespite the odds and the complex challenges, we \r\nmust press on, with courage and fortitude, for the sake of \r\nour peoples and seize the promise of a better tomorrow \r\nfor future generations. Let us not forget — to borrow the \r\nwords of a distinguished member of humankind — that \r\nin our determination to transform the world, it is not \r\nenough to see things as they are and ask, “Why?” Let us \r\nall dream of things that never were and ask, “Why not?”\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates.\r\nSheikh Al Nahyan (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I am pleased to congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session and to reaffirm the United Arab \r\nEmirates’ support for his efforts during his term. I \r\nwould also like to express my thanks and appreciation \r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his wise \r\nleadership during the previous session.\r\nIn our region and beyond, several countries have \r\nconfronted multiple ongoing crises and conflicts since \r\n2011. A number of Arab countries, including Yemen, \r\nLibya, Iraq, Syria and Somalia, have descended into \r\ninternal fighting. At the same time, the plight of the \r\nPalestinian people persists under Israeli occupation \r\nwithout a just solution on the horizon, one that could \r\nrestore the rights stripped from the Palestinians and \r\nestablish their State based on the June 1967 borders, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nFurthermore, regional interference in Arab affairs, \r\nperpetrated mainly by Iran — the only country in the \r\nworld with a Constitution that explicitly calls for the \r\nexport of its revolution — has aggravated conflicts in \r\nthe region. The past few years have shown that solutions \r\nbased on crisis management are ineffective. Therefore, \r\njoint international efforts must focus on resolving the \r\ncrises and conflicts — not just managing them.\r\nWe are all aware of the violence and terrorism around \r\nus, which have taken unprecedented forms, relying on \r\nheinous methods and causing fear and terror not only in \r\nthe Middle East, but also in many countries worldwide. \r\nThat demonstrates that violence and terrorism must no \r\nlonger be associated with a single State or region, as \r\nthey are global threats that recognize no borders. The \r\nserious challenges facing our region and many other \r\ncountries require our joint consideration of ways to \r\naddress them and reach consensual, timely, effective \r\nsolutions, without undermining the ongoing significant \r\nefforts in that regard.\r\nCountering terrorist groups is a right and duty of \r\nall States. However, resorting to laws that ignore the \r\neffective role played by a number of States in counter-\r\nterrorism would lead to suffering in many States. In that \r\nrespect, we recall the so-called Justice against Sponsors \r\nof Terrorism Act in the United States of America, which \r\nhas resulted in arbitrary policies and the destabilization \r\nof existing strong relationships among allies. I will \r\nattempt to present some thoughts on ways to diagnose \r\nthe crises and determine potential solutions.\r\nFor example, Iraq has been suffering for more than \r\na decade from nearly daily acts of sectarian violence. \r\nIin addition, a part of its territory is under the control \r\nof terrorist groups, thus spreading fear and terror in the \r\nhearts of the Iraqi people and undermining the region’s \r\nintegrity. Moreover, interference by Iran in Iraq’s \r\ninternal affairs has exacerbated divisiveness among the \r\nIraqi people. Yet there is no comprehensive political \r\nsolution that can promote consensus among the Iraqi \r\npeople and put an end to the marginalization of whole \r\nsections of Iraqi society.\r\nWhat have the effective Powers done in that regard? \r\nWhat have the prominent Powers capable of addressing \r\nthose serious crises done? Those Powers, or so-called \r\nsuper-Powers, have simply tried to minimize the impact \r\nwithout resolving the crisis. That approach has merely \r\nmade the crises increasingly complex, with the collapse \r\nof State institutions and the emergence of terrorism and \r\nextremism. Thathasled to the high price being paid, \r\nespecially in terms of the loss of life on the part of the \r\nregion’s children, as well as their futures.\r\nWe find that Iran, as a result of its expansionist \r\nregional policies, has led the region to the brink of \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 5/34\r\ndisaster. Through its constant interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of neighbouring countries, it has played \r\nthe greatest role in causing tension and instability in \r\nthe region. Despite the so-called nuclear agreement \r\nreached between Tehran and the P5+1 — which was \r\nwelcomed by countries in the region in the hope that \r\nthe deal would change Iran’s hostile approach — and \r\ndespite all of the optimistic expectations, we have faced \r\na different reality in that Iran has wasted no time in \r\npursuing efforts to undermine regional security through \r\naggressive rhetoric, blatant interference, the training \r\nand arming of militias and the development of its \r\nballistic missile programme. Iran has been designated a \r\nState sponsor of terrorism, in itself quite alarming. Yet, \r\ndespite all of the above, Tehran has refused to rescind \r\nits policies, which means that in order to confront and \r\nsolve the crises, we must deal with Iran’s behaviour.\r\nA further example of that trend can be seen in the \r\ndecision of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nto develop its nuclear and ballistic capacities and carry \r\nout regular testing, which threatens its neighbours’ \r\nsecurity, as well as international peace and security, \r\nand is clearly contrary to the most fundamental rules of \r\ninternational law. The same can be said of the crises in \r\nLibya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia. The lack of awareness \r\nof those crises and the lack of timely responses aimed \r\nat preventing the exacerbation of the suffering of many \r\npeople are evident in the current developments in the \r\nArab region, where the repercussions of certain crises \r\nhave gone beyond borders.\r\nThe ensuing refugee crisis and mass exodus from \r\nconflict areas and the consequent pressures on many \r\ncountries have indicated the need to work together \r\nwithin and beyond our region to develop solutions \r\nthat rise above individual interests. That provides yet \r\nanother example of how ignoring crises or settling for \r\nmanaging them, rather than finding tangible solutions, \r\nhas further exacerbated the crises and transformed \r\nthe situation into one that is more complex and \r\ncompartmentalized. \r\nDespite the gravity of the crises that we all face, \r\nfinding solutions is not impossible, if the international \r\ncommunity and interested sides demonstrate good will \r\nand the political determination to resolve them. Allow \r\nme, in that regard, to offer the following thoughts:\r\nFirst, solutions must be based on justice and respect \r\nfor the law. Without exception, no role should be given \r\nto any extremist, terrorist or evil party or group under \r\nany circumstances. We call on Iran and all regional \r\nparties to abandon the evil role that they are playing, \r\nwhich incites sectarianism and further ignites tension. \r\nSecondly, we must attempt to resolve some of the \r\nfundamental crises in a number of countries in the \r\nregion, which is key to finding solutions to other crises, \r\nparticularly in Yemen and Libya.\r\nIn Yemen, there have been a number of initiatives, \r\nincluding an effective road map put forward by the \r\nlegitimate Government of Yemen, now in Kuwait, \r\nand at the Quartet meeting held in Jeddah in August, \r\nthat could have saved the Yemeni people from their \r\nsuffering. We hope that those efforts can result in a \r\npolitical solution — if the intentions of the militias in \r\nYemen are sincere and if they live up to the standards \r\nof the international community and uphold their \r\nresponsibilities as Yemeni nationals.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates also welcomes the Skhirat \r\nAgreement reached by the parties in Libya, as well as the \r\nformation of the Government of National Accord. We \r\nhope that it will lead to constitution-building in Libya \r\nand strengthen cooperation between the Presidential \r\nCouncil and the House of Representatives, which are \r\nthe legitimate representatives of the Libyan people. \r\nThat would result in a more unified Libyan national \r\nAdministration capable of protecting Libya’s territorial \r\nintegrity and maintaining the unity of the people.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates sees no possibility of \r\nresolving the Syrian crisis through anything other than \r\na political solution. There is no possibility of resolving \r\nit through military force. To date, that path has only \r\nintensified the suffering of the fraternal people of \r\nSyria and led to increased f lows of refugees to other \r\ncountries. The crisis has been further complicated by \r\ninterference on the part of Iran and its terrorist militias \r\nin Syrian affairs. That has distorted the vision for Syria \r\nand derailed it from the existing path.\r\nOur hearts bleed when we see the brotherly \r\npeople of Syria attempting to f lee from death. We \r\nare deeply saddened that the Syrian people, known \r\nfor their dignity and ancient civilization, are forced \r\nby the ongoing fighting in their country to fall into \r\nthe hands of an unknown fate, a fate that began with \r\nforced displacement, with no end in sight. In addition, \r\nthey experience humiliation as they are turned away \r\nfrom the borders of other countries. The repercussions \r\nof the Syrian crisis — and the impact of violence, \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n6/34 16-29817\r\ndisplacement and an uncertain future — will affect \r\nfuture generations of Syrians. \r\nThese examples affirm the regional view that \r\nsettling for crisis management, repeating charitable \r\nhumanitarian efforts or holding recurring international \r\nconferences will not substitute for solving those crises.\r\nDespite the complexity of the crises overtaking our \r\nregion, there is still hope for overcoming and resolving \r\nthem. That is evident in the solutions adopted by the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the brotherly Kingdom of \r\nSaudi Arabia, which will, we hope, have a positive \r\nimpact on other countries in the region. The United \r\nArab Emirates firmly believes in the values of justice, \r\ninternational law, human rights and good governance. \r\nWe wish to provide an enhanced environment of \r\nhappiness for our citizens and residents. We believe that \r\ntrue development does not focus solely on the economic \r\nfactors but also on the people themselves, based on the \r\nprinciples of tolerance, the acceptance of others and \r\nequality for all. \r\nThe empowerment of women is a central policy \r\nin my country, based on a belief in the pioneering \r\nsocietal role they play. The education of our citizens \r\nis also a priority, and we have developed policies and \r\nlegislation to reflect that.  We believe that the essential \r\nframework to achieve those goals should be based on \r\nprotecting the State, in particular from extremism and \r\nsectarianism. That would solidify and strengthen our \r\nState against factors of disintegration and collapse that \r\nhave threatened other countries in the region. \r\nIn that regard, we have established the Hedayah \r\nCentre to counter extremism and have participated with \r\nthe United States in the establishment of the Sawab \r\nCentre. Additionally, the Muslim Council of Elders and \r\nthe Forum for Promoting Peace in Muslim Societies \r\nwere established to show the true face of Islam. Those \r\ninstitutions aim to protect young people who have been \r\nattracted by extremist, sectarian and terrorist groups \r\nand counter the false claims of such groups.\r\nThe crisis in our region should not distract us from \r\nour core national cause, which is United Arab Emirates \r\nsovereignty over its three islands of Greater Tunb, \r\nLesser Tunb and Abu Musa, which are being occupied \r\nby Iran against the provisions of international law and \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. My country has \r\ncalled on our neighbour Iran time and time again to \r\nreturn those occupied islands to their rightful owner, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates, either voluntarily through \r\npeaceful means or through international justice and \r\narbitration. in order to maintain friendly, neighbourly \r\nrelations in the Persian Gulf. We will never give up our \r\nsovereign right over those islands, and our approach is \r\nbased on the principles of international law.\r\nOur faith in the role of the United Nations and its \r\norgans, especially the Security Council, in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security is unwavering. We \r\nexpect the United Nations to play an effective and vital \r\nrole in resolving conflicts, strengthening the ability of \r\nStates to resolve conflicts through a framework based \r\non respect for national sovereignty and non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of States. \r\nTTo enable the Security Council to carry out that \r\nrole, the Council members need to work together for the \r\nbenefit and well-being of our region. In order to ensure \r\nthat the United Nations is effective in a multipolar \r\nworld, we must grant the General Assembly a greater \r\nrole and pay more attention to early planning so as to \r\npromote security and stability. We can do that through \r\nconstructive strategies and programmes that aim to \r\nachieve sustainable development, eradicate poverty, \r\nfight inequality, address climate change, defend human \r\nrights and much more. \r\nWe are firmly convinced that the effectiveness \r\nof the United Nations and its principal organs can be \r\nachieved through institutional cooperation with regional \r\norganizations, using clear mechanisms of cooperation, \r\nand that such cooperation is the cornerstone of the \r\nUnited Nations work. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates looks forward to \r\nworking with the incoming Secretary-General with a \r\nview to promoting the work and effectiveness of the \r\nUnited Nations, so as to ensure further progress and \r\nfind solutions to conflicts, as well as build the capacities \r\nrequired to maintain international peace and security.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ibrahim Ahmed Abd al-Aziz Ghandour, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Republic of the Sudan.\r\nMr. Ghandour (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is my \r\ngreat pleasure, in my personal capacity as well as on \r\nbehalf of the Government and the people of the Republic \r\nof the Sudan, to convey my desire for the successful \r\noutcome of these deliberations during this important \r\nsession of the General Assembly. Our agenda is one of \r\nhope for a better and more prosperous future. We must \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 7/34\r\nconsider the issues of peace and security, development, \r\nhuman rights, and humanitarian matters in particular. \r\nIt is also my pleasure to express my congratulations \r\nto Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. I would also like \r\nto express our gratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for \r\nthe skilful and wise manner in which he led the work of \r\nthe Assembly at the previous session.\r\nThe high-level general debate of this session \r\nis taking place under the theme “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform \r\nour world”. That reflects the interest of the United \r\nNations in realizing the hopes and aspirations of our \r\ncountries and our peoples, in achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment and prosperity for future generations, in \r\neradicating poverty and disparities among people, and \r\nin protecting our planet and promoting sustainable \r\ndevelopment through international partnerships, \r\nwhere all stakeholders are involved. We hope that all \r\nstakeholders will respect their commitments to achieve \r\nthat objective in order to avoid the repercussions of \r\npoverty, for we are aware that poverty, regardless of \r\nwhere it is, threatens prosperity throughout the world.\r\nMy country today reaffirms its unwavering \r\ncommitment to the principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. We reaffirm our interest in the need \r\nto continue efforts to reform this institution and develop \r\nits structures. We hope that the regional coalitions \r\ncalling for General Assembly and Security Council \r\nreform do not go unheeded, so that the United Nations \r\ncan truly become a platform for the implementation \r\nof international legality and a guarantor of justice and \r\ndevelopment throughout our world. I would like to \r\nreaffirm my country’s commitment to dialogue with \r\nthe international community aimed at strengthening \r\nvalues such as international justice and the fight against \r\nimpunity through international mechanisms that are \r\nneither selective nor politicized.\r\nIn our view it is clear that the Rome Statute of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), which should \r\nseek to enforce justice throughout the world, in fact \r\nhinders peace in its practical reality. That can be seen \r\nin the regions where it undertakes action, particularly \r\nin Africa. The African States therefore call for the \r\ndrafting of a plan to collectively withdraw from the \r\nICC. It is crucial that a distinction be drawn between \r\njustice and the politicization of justice.\r\nTo achieve peace, we have to strive to work together. \r\nThis is one of our favourite topics. I would like to \r\nexpress our gratitude to all those who have endeavoured \r\nto achieve this very noble objective. Furthermore, I can \r\nconfirm that we are going to knock on every single \r\ndoor of peace, and dialogue will be the only solution. \r\nAccordingly, my Government has spared no effort to \r\nensure that peace prevails. Today, we are strengthening \r\nour social fabric and continuing our efforts aimed at \r\nrebuilding my country.\r\nThanks to God and thanks to the determination of \r\nmy country and of the loyal people of the Sudan, Darfur \r\nhas become a safe region, where peace and security \r\nhave prevailed. The United Nations is a witness to \r\nthis fact. The Government of the Sudan calls for the \r\nimplementation of the plan for the withdrawal of the \r\nAfrican Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation in \r\nDarfur (UNAMID). I would like to reaffirm from \r\nthis high rostrum that the Government of the Sudan \r\nreiterates its call to have UNAMID forces withdraw, \r\nfor there are no more reasons for their presence there. \r\nThose forces could be deployed elsewhere to serve to \r\nconsolidate peace in the parts of the world that truly \r\nneed it.\r\nThe theme of the general debate of this session is \r\n“The Sustainable Development Goals: a universal push \r\nto transform our world”. To achieve the objectives, \r\npurposes and principles implicit in this theme, we need \r\nto act together. \r\nWe also need to act together to achieve genuine \r\nmomentum in bridging the food gap around the world. \r\nIn this regard, I would like to recall the food security \r\ninitiative launched by the President of the Republic, \r\nMr. Omar Hassan Al-Bashir, during the third Arab \r\nEconomic and Social Development Summit, in 2013. \r\nThis initiative, which was subsequently adopted at the \r\nSharm El-Sheikh summit in 2016, serves as one of the \r\npillars for food security around the world. I call upon \r\nthe United Nations and all specialized agencies to \r\ncarry out the necessary studies to ensure the success of \r\nthis initiative. We in the Sudan possess the necessary \r\ncapabilities and skills to move forward on this universal \r\npush and stand ready to do so.\r\nWe wish to fulfil our commitments to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals with a view to \r\nguaranteeing a dignified life for all. But given the \r\nunjustified unilateral sanctions and the burden of our \r\nforeign debt, which stands at over $40 billion, that will \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n8/34 16-29817\r\nnot be easy. When one looks at the interest to be paid \r\nand the very complex contractual provisions, it is quite \r\nclear that 40 per cent of this debt is nothing more than \r\ninterest growing on a yearly basis. That debt naturally \r\nhampers our country and its economic capabilities. \r\nIn addition, the Sudan is not able to benefit from \r\ninternational financial support initiatives.\r\nI would also like to state here that the agreement \r\non the zero option for foreign debt, which we signed \r\nafter South Sudan split from the Republic of the Sudan, \r\nterminated in 2014. The agreement was renewed for two \r\nyears, but it is coming to an end this month, without the \r\ninternational commitments on our debts having been \r\nmet since 2005. No progress has been made in terms of \r\nwriting off those debts, even though my country was \r\neligible for it.\r\nThe Sudan condemns the phenomenon of terrorism, \r\nwhich is why we have to deploy all our efforts \r\nand coordinate with other countries to contain the \r\nphenomenon. What do we need to do? We need to tackle \r\nthe roots of the problem by finding just solutions for the \r\ninternational problems that fuel terrorism: exclusion, \r\nmarginalization and the failure to uphold the rights of \r\npeople who have been deprived of them. To that end, \r\nwe have hosted a number of workshops, seminars and \r\nforums, the most recent of which was entitled “The \r\nRole of the Arab Media in Countering Terrorism”. At \r\nthat forum, held in Khartoum in August, the Khartoum \r\nDeclaration was adopted. It reaffirms the importance \r\nof combating terrorism, the central role of religious \r\ndiscourse, and the need to ensure that educational \r\ncurriculums focuses on tolerance and acceptance of the \r\nother. The media need to be used in the right way to \r\nfight this scourge.\r\nUnfortunately, the future of our planet hinges on \r\nthe fight against such phenomena as the trafficking \r\nin human beings, drug trafficking and other forms \r\nof transnational organized crime. These phenomena \r\nwill be eradicated only if we pool the efforts of the \r\ninternational community and if the States of the world \r\ncooperate to stop these evils.\r\nBecause of the geographical situation of the Sudan, \r\nsome have tried to take advantage of my country by \r\nmaking it a platform for trafficking in human beings \r\nand drug trafficking. With the help of the international \r\ncommunity, we are doing everything we can to fight \r\nthis exploitation, particularly by strengthening our law-\r\nenforcement capabilities and drafting the necessary \r\nlegislation to improve communication and coordination. \r\nThanks be to God, we have made significant progress \r\nin this area despite the lack of resources.\r\nIsrael continues to reject all initiatives aimed at \r\nachieving the two-State solution, which is why we have \r\nto do everything we can to terminate the last colonial \r\nregime in the world. We have to work to implement the \r\ntwo-State solution and create a sovereign Palestinian \r\nState with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nWe attach the greatest importance to the safety, \r\nsecurity and stability of South Sudan, for we have \r\nhistorical blood ties with that country. Together with \r\nthe Intergovernmental Authority on Development and \r\nwith our partners on the African continent and in the \r\ninternational community we will spare no effort to \r\nback our brothers in South Sudan and ensure that peace \r\nand security prevail in that country.\r\nWith an eye to calming all other hotbeds of tension \r\naround the world, we call for a peaceful solution to the \r\ncrisis in Syria. We must move away from any solution \r\nthat involves force. We must preserve the territorial \r\nintegrity of Syria. With respect to Yemen, we reaffirm \r\nour support to the Government of President Abdrabuh \r\nMansour Hadi Mansour. With respect to Libya, we \r\nreaffirm our support for the Government of President \r\nFaiez Mustafa Serraj and will spare no effort to preserve \r\nthe territorial integrity, security and stability of the \r\ncountry and protect its resources.\r\nI also wish to reaffirm the basic principle of our \r\nforeign policy, which is non-interference in the affairs \r\nof others. We reaffirm our support for the stability of \r\nSouth Sudan and the Central African Republic. We call \r\nupon the international community to spare no effort and \r\nto leave no stone unturned in helping these countries \r\novercome the difficulties they are facing. The Sudan \r\ncalls for dialogue and the renunciation of the use of \r\nforce when it comes to managing and settling conflicts \r\naround the world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Prak Sokhonn, Senior Minister, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nKingdom of Cambodia.\r\nMr. Sokhonn (Cambodia) (spoke in French): I \r\nshould like to cordially congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Peter Thomson of the Republic of Fiji on his election \r\nas President of the Assembly at its seventy-first session. \r\nWith a representative from a country that is famous \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 9/34\r\nfor the quality of its rugby leading our work, we can \r\nbe assured that our work will be masterfully refereed. \r\nI wish to join those who have already expressed our \r\ncollective gratitude to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho in his capacity as Secretary-General has spared no \r\neffort to preserve peace where it is threatened and to \r\nrestore it where violence is raging. The limitations that \r\nhe encountered during his tenure were not his own, but \r\nthose of a United Nations in need of reform.\r\nThe general debate provides us with an opportunity \r\nto take stock of humankind and our planet. Each and \r\nevery one of us must make an effort to express the \r\nconcerns and expectations of our peoples. We are the \r\nvoices of the world. To say that the world is doing well, \r\nhowever, would not be credible. It must be noted that the \r\noutstanding progress made in science and technology \r\nhas not been used to serve peace or the well-being of \r\nhumankind.\r\nThere is a word that summarizes the tragedy of \r\nour world: violence. I speak here of wartime violence, \r\nterrorist violence, violence towards civilians and, \r\ntragically, towards children, violence towards other \r\nliving species that are disappearing in large numbers, \r\nand violence towards the planet, which is suffering \r\nfrom a degree of turmoil that is threatening the survival \r\nof humankind itself, such as we know it today. \r\nHow is it that in the twenty-first century we are \r\nstill facing these kinds of challenges? It is not enough \r\nto simply observe what is already clearly evident. We \r\nmust understand these problems and respond to them. \r\nOur generation and, above all, future generations \r\ndeserve a better world. Time restraints require that I \r\nfocus on just a few topics. \r\nI would first of all like to address collective \r\nsecurity. The world is reeling from an outbreak of \r\nconflicts ravaging the Near and Middle East, but \r\nin other regions of the world as well. It is no less \r\nanxious about new tensions in other strategic regions \r\nof the planet, as the abuse of the right to intervene \r\nhas catastrophic consequences that destabilize s \r\nStates and entire regions. We observe the opening up \r\nof new global divisions characterized by policies of \r\ncontainment, which causes States to mobilize military \r\nmeans and results in new alliances that exclude certain \r\nother States.\r\nThe world became unipolar in 1991 and has \r\nsince moved towards greater multipolarity, which has \r\nnaturally generated strong resistance and troubling \r\ntypes of behaviour. Should countries large in size, \r\npopulation or economic power be absent from the \r\nSecurity Council? It is clear that the system of collective \r\nsecurity that was implemented in 1945, and which was \r\nadapted to the bipolar world left in the wake of the Cold \r\nWar, is now in great distress. \r\nA small country such as my own too often \r\nfeels pressure to choose sides and tries to reach \r\nunderstandings with other countries in order to give a \r\nvoice to those who are scarcely listened to and who are \r\nalways the first to suffer from geopolitical decisions. We \r\nhave travelled that road before and have been subjected \r\nto a proxy war. Moreover, we cannot simply articulate \r\nthe anguish of new escalating dangers. Together with \r\nall countries that are willing, we want to work to strike \r\na new global balance that respects the realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century. When tensions do emerge, we \r\nbelieve that our role is not to become embroiled in them \r\nbut to enter into dialogue and do everything we can to \r\ncontribute to the peaceful solution of disputes.\r\nCurrent events force me to address the issue of \r\nterrorism and, more specifically, its root causes. Is such \r\nfanaticism not just the violent expression of anger? Such \r\nanger must be analysed. There are too many injustices \r\nand inequalities in our world. More importantly, there \r\nis an overly systematic two-tier system when it comes to \r\ndecision-making. International law is imposed on some \r\nwhile others are exempted. With regard to religion, each \r\nGovernment must ensure, as we have successfully done \r\nin Cambodia, that members of all faiths can peacefully \r\nand respectfully live together in tolerance. \r\nHow can we overlook the tragedy of the Palestinian \r\npeople, whose rights have been violated for 70 years? \r\nThis tragedy has fed the revolt in the Arab world and \r\nhatred among the most indignant. An entire population’s \r\nrights have been denied for decades. When faced with \r\nsuch a fact, how can we not understand that discourse \r\non universal values and international law is no longer \r\ncredible? \r\nWe hold no illusions; terrorism will be eradicated \r\nonly when the principal reasons for becoming a terrorist \r\nno longer exist.\r\nI would like to make a short comment on the \r\neconomy. We now have sufficient experience in that \r\narea to evaluate the globalization born from World \r\nTrade Organization agreements and subsequent free \r\ntrade agreements. Such experience has allowed us to \r\nmake progress through the liberalization of markets, \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n10/34 16-29817\r\nbut it has also shown us that real dangers emerge when \r\ncorporations are given rights that allow them to conduct \r\ntheir business in any way they see fit. Continuous \r\nblackmail in favour of offshoring is a major obstacle to \r\na country like mine, where we are working to improve \r\nworking conditions and the standard of living, which \r\nremains low.\r\nI wish to share in the collective satisfaction following \r\nthe agreement last December at the twenty-first session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. We also \r\nwelcome the fact that the two principal contributors to \r\nglobal warming have confirmed their involvement and \r\ndetermination. Sometimes deception is employed when \r\nit comes to respecting treaties, but it is an undeniable \r\ntruth that we cannot deceive our planet. If the twenty-\r\nfirst session of the Conference of the Parties does not \r\nlead to concrete actions taken by all parties, there will \r\nbe terrible and unstoppable consequences, leading to \r\na series of destructive phenomena that will create new \r\nlevels of suffering.\r\nI now turn to the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs). The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nembodies a series of very ambitious objectives. Such \r\nambitions need to be matched, however, with a \r\ncorresponding level of true political will. In that regard, \r\nI would like to highlight the responsibility of wealthy \r\ncountries, which have the necessary resources to make \r\nthe Goals a reality. Although the world has indeed \r\nmade great progress in terms of human development \r\nsince 1990, we should pay particular attention to two \r\nfacts provided by the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme: there are more than 2 billion people living \r\nin poverty in the world and 1.2 billion people living on \r\nless than $1.25 per day. If we take into consideration \r\nthose two figures alone, the 17 SDGs become even \r\nmore urgent.\r\n I would like to conclude by speaking about my \r\ncountry, Cambodia. International institutions, Western \r\nparliamentarians and some Western non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs) have pointed the finger and \r\ntried to lay blame. However, I do not come before the \r\nAssembly as an accused party. I am addressing those \r\npresent on behalf of a country that is often judged \r\nnegatively, and even more often unrecognized and \r\nmisunderstood, especially by the Western world. I \r\ncome here with confidence. Many of us here refuse \r\nto see the international community conflated with the \r\nWestern community and its opinions.\r\nI am a survivor of the atrocities of Pol Pot and of a \r\ncountry that was turned into an immense forced labour \r\ncamp. After United States Air Force bombers completely \r\ndestroyed us, our country endured the extreme \r\nsuffering brought on by one of the cruelest regimes of \r\nthe twentieth century. I must therefore recall that in the \r\nwake of such aff liction in Cambodia in 1979, Viet Nam \r\nwas the only member of the international community \r\nto respond to the call of those f leeing the genocidal \r\nregime. Our population of 8 million inhabitants in \r\n1970 had been reduced to some 4.5 million by 1979. \r\nThe State, central and local Governments, hospitals, \r\nschools, our currency and religion had all ceased to \r\nexist. The roads were damaged and infrastructure and \r\ninstitutions had disappeared. In 1979, all that remained \r\nin Cambodia were 8 of our 750 lawyers, 45 of our 450 \r\ndoctors and 7,000 of our 22,000 teachers. A total of \r\n54 per cent of all medical personnel were gone, and of \r\nour 1,600 agricultural technicians, only 200 were still \r\nalive.\r\nIn 1979, the survivors were in extremely debilitated \r\nphysical and mental states. Nevertheless, they were still \r\npunished for having been freed by a country that had \r\ndone nothing to please the coalition that for over 11 years \r\ncaused total destruction in the country, traumatized \r\nthe survivors and imposed a crippling embargo that \r\nprohibited all development aid. We had nothing and \r\nwe were deprived of everything. Given that, Members \r\nof the Assembly might wonder why would I want to \r\nbring up the past. I do so because it is a past that is \r\nnot yet in the past. How do we not understand that the \r\npast continues to deeply affect the present? How do we \r\nnot understand that the past continues to weigh upon us \r\ntoday in terms of human resources?\r\nIn the West, some NGOs, media and Governments \r\ndescribe even our slightest shortcomings as crimes \r\nof the State. With the Paris accords, we were obliged \r\nto accept a perfect model of democracy that took no \r\naccount of the specificities of our country or the human \r\nresources required to implement it. We are now being \r\ncriticized for disregarding the rights of the opposition. \r\nAt the same time, however, the western NGOs and \r\nGovernments that support the political opposition \r\nclaim that we are violating our laws and not punishing \r\ncrimes that undermine our national security, such as \r\ndefamation, calumny, incitement to racial hatred and \r\nthe production of fake treaties and identification cards. \r\nMeanwhile, it is the opposition that is committing these \r\ncrimes.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 11/34\r\nWe have made considerable progress in education, \r\nhealth care and infrastructure. Similarly, we have \r\nsuccessfully fought AIDS and malaria. We have \r\nundertaken a long and difficult fight against corruption. \r\nOur Ministries of the Environment and Agriculture \r\nare striving to correct the mistakes that have been \r\nmade with respect to forestry licenses. The poverty \r\nrate has dropped every year by 1 per cent and we have \r\nexperienced an average growth rate of more than 7 per \r\ncent since 1994.\r\nIn Cambodia, we are addressing an issues that can \r\ntruly hinder sustainable development — mines and \r\nexplosive remnants of war. We have made the eradication \r\nof these deadly devices an eighteenth Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal in Cambodia, similar to what \r\nwe did with the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nOur country, which has gained has considerable and \r\npainful experience in demining, has been participating \r\nin peacekeeping operations by sending demining \r\ncontingents since 2006. Currently, more than 900 \r\nwomen and men of these contingents, as well as \r\nengineers, doctors and military police, are working \r\nin Lebanon, Mali, the Central African Republic, the \r\nSudan and South Sudan.\r\nRegarding climate change, I am pleased to announce \r\nthat just yesterday we completed the procedure of \r\nratifying the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nWe have known the extreme horrors of war. \r\nMore than others, we understand the price of peace, \r\nand we prioritize peaceful conflict resolution in \r\nall circumstances, sometimes at the risk of being \r\nmisunderstood. Lastly, our exceptionally difficult past \r\nhas made us part and parcel of the network of States \r\nthat are committed to preventing mass crimes. To that \r\nend, and with regard to the responsibility to protect \r\n(R2P), we have designated the individual who will be \r\nour national correspondent to the Global Network of \r\nR2P Focal Points, proposed by the United Nations. \r\nBased on this assessment, does our country deserve \r\nto be subjected to Western obloquy? We will let those \r\npresent be the judges.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Maxime Pamela Ometa McClean, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.\r\nMs. McClean (Barbados): I am pleased today to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Thomson on his assumption of the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. The Government of Barbados is pleased \r\nthat Fiji, a fellow small island developing State (SIDS), \r\nhas been elevated to such an important office. Forty-\r\nsix years ago, the Prime Minister of Barbados, The \r\nHonourable Errol Walton Barrow, in his address to \r\nthis body, congratulated Fiji on its attainment of \r\nindependence (see A/PV.1866). He pointed out that \r\nBarbados was especially pleased to have been one of \r\nthe sponsors of resolution 2622 (XXV), admitting Fiji \r\nto the United Nations. I assure the President of the full \r\nsupport and cooperation of the Barbados delegation as \r\nhe discharges his duties.\r\nI extend sincere thanks to his predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his steady \r\nguidance of the work of the General Assembly during \r\nits seventieth session.\r\nI also take this opportunity to recognize the \r\ncontribution of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwhose tenure is drawing to an end. Secretary-General \r\nBan has been a dedicated and committed leader of the \r\nOrganization. He has been a friend of SIDS, including \r\nBarbados. The Government of Barbados extends \r\nsincere appreciation for his dedicated global service \r\nduring a turbulent but productive period.\r\nThe seventy-first session is of deep significance \r\nto Barbados. It coincides with the celebration this year \r\nof two historic anniversaries. On 30 November, we \r\ncelebrate our fiftieth anniversary of independence and \r\nnationhood, followed closely by our fiftieth anniversary \r\nof membership in the United Nations.\r\nOne of the cornerstones on which the foreign policy \r\nof Barbados is built is our unwavering commitment \r\nto the United Nations. We see the United Nations as \r\nthe core of an effective multilateral system, with \r\nresponsibility for addressing issues of international \r\npeace, security and development. Today, 50 years \r\non, Barbados stands more firmly committed to the \r\nprinciple of multilateralism. For the United Nations \r\nto deliver on our expectations, its organizational \r\nstructure must reflect the geopolitical realities of the \r\ntwenty-first century. We therefore support efforts \r\nto reform the Security Council and to revitalize the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe theme of this year’s General Assembly is “The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push to \r\ntransform our world”. We must act now to make the vision \r\nof 2030 a reality. Barbados believes that partnership and \r\ncollaboration will be the keys to fulfilling the promise \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n12/34 16-29817\r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. That \r\nis especially true for SIDS.\r\nThe Prime Minister of Barbados, Mr. Freundel \r\nStuart, addressed this theme in his statement to the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States Leaders’ Conference, \r\nheld in the margins of the Third International Conference \r\non Small Island Developing States in September 2014. \r\nPrime Minister Stuart highlighted the importance of \r\nUnited Nations support for the implementation of the \r\nSIDS Agenda. We therefore welcome the progress made \r\nby the Joint Inspection Unit (JIU) in its comprehensive \r\nreview of the United Nations system’s support for \r\nSIDS, and we look forward to tangible improvements \r\nas a result of its work.\r\nLast week, I was pleased to participate in the \r\nlaunch, in Barbados, of the Caribbean Human \r\nDevelopment Report 2016. The theme of the report is \r\n“Multidimensional progress: human resilience beyond \r\nincome”. It highlights the unique situation of the small \r\nisland developing States and low-lying coastal States \r\nin the Caribbean. Three central issues stand out: \r\nvulnerability, resilience and sustainability. Barbados \r\nwelcomes the report. It validates the consistent \r\ncall by the Heads of Government of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity (CARICOM), and of SIDS in general, for \r\nSIDS to be recognized as a special case for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. \r\nThe Government of Barbados is devising and \r\nimplementing effective strategies to strengthen social, \r\neconomic and environmental resilience that is consistent \r\nwith our national growth and development philosophy. \r\nIt is based on supporting a Barbados that is socially \r\nbalanced, economically viable, environmentally \r\nsound, and characterized by good governance — our \r\nfour strategic pillars. We are therefore pleased that \r\nBarbados is already pursuing the ideals enshrined in \r\nAgenda 2030.\r\nThe existential threat which climate change poses \r\nto small island developing States like Barbados is well \r\ndocumented. We are a leading advocate for coordinated \r\naction at the international level to address the sources \r\nand consequences of our vulnerability. The Prime \r\nMinister of Barbados was one of the leaders who \r\nparticipated in the formal signing ceremony of the \r\nlandmark Paris Agreement on Climate Change in April. \r\nHe deposited the instrument of ratification on the same \r\noccasion. We look forward to its early entry into force. \r\nAt the national level, Barbados has developed a national \r\nclimate change policy framework that works seamlessly \r\nwith the Barbados sustainable development policy to \r\naddress issues of climate adaptation and mitigation.\r\nBarbados exercises jurisdiction over maritime \r\nspace that far exceeds its very limited land territory. We \r\ntherefore recognize the vast potential of the ocean and \r\nits sustainable exploitation as an important component \r\nof our future development. We are also developing a \r\ncomprehensive national ocean governance strategyto \r\naddress the sustainable management of our maritime \r\nspace and the sustainable use of Barbados’ marine \r\nliving and non-living resources. \r\nAs we seek to protect and preserve our oceans and \r\nseas for future generations, Barbados will continue \r\nto participate actively in the various oceans-related \r\nprocesses of the United Nations. During the current \r\nsession, my delegation will collaborate with other \r\nmembers of the Association of Caribbean States to \r\nstrengthen the level of support for the Caribbean Sea \r\nresolution. Our ultimate aim is the designation of \r\nthe Caribbean Sea as a special area in the context of \r\nsustainable development. We count on your support.\r\nBarbadians are a proud and industrious people. \r\nWith minimal natural resources and the constraints of \r\nsmall size and vulnerability to natural and man-made \r\ndisasters, our people have achieved a significant level \r\nof human development in 50 years of independence. \r\nWe have done so by dint of hard work, sacrifice and \r\nfaith. We remain resolute in our determination to \r\novercome the many obstacles we face: the unilateral \r\nand unidimensional graduation policies of international \r\ndevelopment agencies that penalize us for progress \r\nin human development, while ignoring our obvious \r\nvulnerabilities; the negative impact of the economic \r\nand financial decisions of international financial and \r\nother institutions, illustrated by the consequences \r\nof de-risking on correspondent banking activity; \r\nand the persistent and unwarranted attacks on our \r\ninternational financial services sector, accompanied \r\nby the imposition of onerous conditionalities. Those \r\nactions threaten our economic stability and our ability \r\nto participate in global financial, trade and economic \r\nsystems. They undermine our capacity to achieve the \r\nfull implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We call for dialogue with development partners \r\nand greater policy space and policy f lexibility for SIDS.\r\nThe United Nations was born of the post-war \r\ndesire of nations for international peace and security. \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 13/34\r\nBarbados is a firm proponent of the rule of law at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. We reiterate \r\nour commitment to maintaining the Caribbean as a \r\nzone of peace. In that context, Barbados reaffirms \r\nits unwavering support for the territorial integrity of \r\nfellow CARICOM States Belize and Guyana. We call \r\nfor definitive solutions to their long-standing disputes \r\nwith neighbouring States Guatemala and Venezuela. \r\nBarbados welcomes the recent steady progress towards \r\nthe normalization of bilateral relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States of America. We look forward \r\nto the dismantling of the final vestiges of that long-\r\nstanding embargo.\r\nOn that memorable evening on 30 November 1966, \r\nas the national f lag of Barbados was unfurled for the \r\nfirst time, there was a sense of exultation, expectation \r\nand pride. Our first Prime Minister stated in his first \r\naddress to the General Assembly:\r\n“Humility must be the most appropriate feeling \r\nfor the leader of a State admitted to membership of \r\nthis illustrious Assembly on the basis of sovereign \r\nequality.” (A/PV.1487, para. 72)\r\nHalf a century later, we believe that both \r\nindependence and membership in the United Nations \r\nhave served us well and afforded us the opportunity to \r\npursue the goals which have informed the progress that \r\nwe have achieved. Looking forward, we are committed \r\nto the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda. \r\nWe expect it to guarantee further development of \r\nthe Barbadian economy and society and to serve as \r\nour contribution to the universal push to transform \r\nour world.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alain Aimé Nyamitwe, Minister for \r\nExternal Relations and International Cooperation of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi.\r\nMr. Nyamitwe (Burundi) (spoke in French): I \r\nwould like to thank our Lord, who has watched over \r\nus on our journey and enabled us to be here for this \r\nimportant meeting of the United Nations.\r\nOn behalf of Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President of \r\nthe Republic of Burundi, and of the entire Burundian \r\npeople, I would like to congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\na worthy son of Fiji, on his election on 13 June to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession. He will always be able to count on Burundi’s \r\nfull cooperation during his tenure. I also commend \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft for his excellent work in \r\npresiding with brio over the seventieth session, which \r\nhe brought to a delightful close on 13 September.\r\nI would also like to reiterate our confidence \r\nin Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. Burundi will \r\ncooperate fully with him during the remainder of \r\nhis term and wishes him health, happiness and every \r\nsuccess in his future work. We would also like to convey \r\nour best wishes to the new Secretary-General, who will \r\nbe starting at a very important moment for the world.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nRegarding the inter-Burundian dialogue, the \r\nGovernment of Burundi has participated in every \r\nmeeting held at the invitation of the facilitator of the \r\nEast African Community (EAC). I would like to inform \r\nthe Assembly that on 8 September, the facilitator, \r\nMr. Benjamin Mkapa, former President of the United \r\nRepublic of Tanzania, presented his report to the EAC \r\nsummit, calling for a renewed commitment on the part \r\nof all stakeholders to engaging in the EAC-led dialogue. \r\nThe Government of the Republic of Burundi is of the \r\nview that the dialogue should not replace or undermine \r\nthe democratic tenets of the country’s Constitution, \r\nwhile it reaffirms its commitment to the dialogue, as \r\nexpressed at the last EAC summit.\r\nWe believe that peaceful political stakeholders, in \r\naccordance with the provisions of Security Council \r\nresolutions 2248 (2015) and 2279 (2016), are welcome \r\nto discuss the future of Burundi. By the same token, \r\nand with a view to opening up to greater inclusivity, \r\nour national commission for inter-Burundian dialogue \r\nhas submitted its report on six months of discussions \r\nwith Burundians from all walks of life, from grassroots \r\ncommunities to the upper echelons of society. Our \r\ncitizens have called for a number of major reforms for \r\nimproving Burundi’s stability that cannot be ignored, \r\nand the Government has taken note of them.\r\nI stand before the Assembly today to reiterate \r\nBurundi’s unwavering commitment to human rights. A \r\nwell-regarded national commission and fully f ledged \r\nministerial department are in charge of human rights, \r\nand we should support them. The Government wishes \r\nto reaffirm its commitment to ensuring the security of \r\nall our citizens, regardless of their ethnic origin. None \r\nof the three ethnic groups is above the others, nor is any \r\ngroup a pariah. As established in our Constitution, all \r\nour citizens have equal opportunities.\r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n14/34 16-29817\r\nCurrently in Burundi, we are working to consolidate \r\nsecurity gains in the face of numerous actors with only \r\none goal — regime change — and whose methods are \r\nuniformly violent. It is crucial to ensure great caution \r\nin assessing the situation. The fact is that rumors, false \r\ninformation and social media, have all been used to \r\nportray Burundi in a bad light. I would therefore like \r\nto take this opportunity to categorically reject the \r\ndeliberattely politically exaggerated reports of alleged \r\nhuman rights violations in Burundi. Some cases have \r\nbeen taken out of context and others blown out of \r\nproportion, with no mention of the security personnel \r\nwho have been killed while on duty. The report I refer to \r\n(A/HRC/32/30) is marred by its controversial selection \r\nof victims, while the method of collecting testimony \r\nthrough WhatsApp messages is a departure from \r\nUnited Nations practices. Our Government will take \r\nthe opportunity to present a comprehensive counter-\r\nreport in Geneva in the next few days.\r\nOn the other hand, Burundi would like to \r\nreiterate its openness to the African Union’s human \r\nrights monitors and military experts. The financial \r\nand structural challenges that the African Union \r\nCommission is dealing with, which have stalled the \r\ngeneration of the necessary personnel, are not our fault. \r\nRegarding the memorandum of understanding between \r\nBurundi and the Commission, my Government calls on \r\nthe Commission to uphold fully and in good faith the \r\nterms of the agreement reached in Bujumbura during \r\nthe meeting in February of the six African Union Heads \r\nof State and Government.\r\nRegarding Security Council resolution 2303 (2016), \r\nadopted under Chapter VI of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, Burundi was shocked by the lack of consensus \r\nand the surprise manner in which it was adopted. While \r\nthe consultations before the adoption did not result in \r\nfull approval of the penholder’s proposal, some Council \r\nmembers thought that Burundi’s consent should be \r\nobtained before creating a fait accompli. Resolutions \r\nunder Chapter VI of the Charter are predicated on the \r\nconsent of the Government concerned.\r\nWhere the humanitarian situation is concerned, our \r\nGovernment has made the return of refugees a priority. \r\nWe are aware of the extremely difficult conditions they \r\nare living in, mostly in neighbouring countries, and \r\nwe will spare no effort to enable every one of them to \r\nreturn home. We have guaranteed the security of their \r\ngoods and property, and around 90,000 refugees have \r\nvoluntarily returned home over the past four months. \r\nI would like to urge all our neighbours to help to \r\nfacilitate their voluntary repatriation. The Government \r\nof the Republic of Burundi is in discussions with the \r\nOffice of the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees on launching tripartite negotiations with the \r\nhost countries.\r\nAlso in line with the relevant provisions of \r\nresolutions 2248 (2015) and 2279 (2016), and in order to \r\ncomply with the 2013 Peace, Security and Cooperation \r\nFramework for the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\nand the Region, the Government of the Republic of \r\nBurundi calls on all its neighbours to refrain from \r\naiding and abetting the violent schemes of some groups, \r\nespecially those that failed in their bid on 13 May 2015 \r\nto overthrow Burundi’s democratic institutions and \r\nattacked us on 10 July 2015. The report of the Group \r\nof Experts on the Democratic Republic of the Congo \r\n(S/2016/466), submitted to the Security Council a few \r\nmonths ago, is comprehensive and clear on the activities \r\nof those groups, which have attacked Burundi more \r\nthan once, and my Government urges the Council to act \r\non those findings.\r\nRegarding United Nations reform, Africa, along \r\nwith other regions of the world, has called for reform \r\nof our Organization’s bodies, particularly the Security \r\nCouncil, again and again. Decision 62/557 paved \r\nthe way for instituting negotiations on reform. As \r\ncountless delegations have pointed out, it is absolutely \r\nunacceptable that, more than seven decades after its \r\ncreation, our Organization is still functioning with the \r\nsame post-war mindset, with a few Members claiming \r\nmore rights than the rest. The Government of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi fully supports the African Union \r\nposition outlined in the Ezulwini Consensus.\r\nOur Organization needs a new impetus. However, \r\nthere are some steps that can be taken even before \r\nthat goal is reached. For instance, the three African \r\nnon-permanent members of the Council should be \r\ngiven more responsibilities and allowed to work \r\nindependently. If more than 70 per cent of the situations \r\nunder consideration by the Council originate in Africa, \r\nit is not too much to ask that the so-called penholders \r\nbe African countries, especially in light of the \r\nsometimes biased views of Africa entertained by some \r\nCouncil members.\r\nThe shock and horror of the images we have seen \r\nof migrants seeking refuge in Europe are a constant \r\nreminder to all of us that while the world we live in \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 15/34\r\nmay be one of shared opportunities it is also one of \r\nshared challenges. While we call on countries of \r\ndestination to demonstrate more humanity in catering to \r\nmigrants, we believe it is important to analyse the deep-\r\nrooted causes of such mass exoduses of the young men, \r\nwomen and children who find it necessary to risk their \r\nlives on the open sea in search of better opportunities. \r\nOne way of reducing the problem is by supporting well-\r\nintentioned development programmes undertaken by \r\nthe countries of the South. As their social and economic \r\nsituation improves, more people will find reasons to \r\nstay in their own countries, but that can happen only \r\nif we all understand that we must respect the political, \r\nsocial, economic and cultural fabric of every country. \r\nUnfortunately, that is not always the case today.\r\nThis year’s general debate is taking place at a time \r\nwhen terrorism is affecting the entire world and has \r\nhit every region. Some progress has been made, but \r\nwe have to recognize the fact that efforts to develop \r\na common strategy have not yet yielded the hoped-for \r\nresults. Terrorist attacks have shaken countries in every \r\ncorner of the world and touched all of us. My country \r\nis concerned about the surge in such attacks, and my \r\nGovernment, as always, condemns terrorism in all its \r\nmanifestations and sympathizes with its victims. We \r\nbelieve that we must wage the fight against terrorism \r\nwith greater determination.\r\nMatching its words with deeds, Burundi has been \r\nsending troops to fight terrorism and violent extremism \r\nin many parts of the world since 2007. More than 5,000 \r\nBurundian troops are in Somalia fighting Al-Shabaab \r\nas part of the African Union Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM). Our continued presence there is proof of \r\nBurundi’s firm commitment to combating terrorism, \r\nin full solidarity with our brothers and sisters on the \r\ncontinent and beyond. We believe that the fight against \r\nterrorism anywhere is a contribution to global peace.\r\nDespite the fact that two formed police units \r\nfrom Burundi were not rotated into the Central \r\nAfrican Republic for politically motivated reasons, \r\nwe remain committed to peace and security, and our \r\nmen and women in uniform are still prepared to serve \r\nin the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic \r\nwith the same zeal that has been shown by our police \r\nunits in Côte d’Ivoire, Haiti and Darfur. Our only \r\ninterest is in helping our brothers and sisters to recover \r\ntheir dignity and freedom. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank the partners that have continued \r\nto support such missions. As a troop-contributing \r\ncountry, Burundi urges the United Nations to fill the \r\ngap left by the cuts in the European Union’s budget \r\nfor AMISOM.\r\nBurundi has also participated in other initiatives, \r\nsuch as the European Union action plan on chemical, \r\nbiological, radiological and nuclear security, aimed at \r\npreventing terrorist groups and non-State actors from \r\nacquiring substances that could be used for terrorist \r\npurposes. However, none of those initiatives can help us \r\ndefeat terrorism if structural causes such as inequality \r\nand poverty are not dealt with. People need to be able to \r\nput bread on the table.\r\nMy delegation would like to note here how \r\nessential it is that all Member States incorporate the \r\n17 Sustainable Development Goals into the design of \r\ntheir policies, programmes and budgets. For its part, \r\nBurundi is committed to putting its citizens at the centre \r\nof its development policies. With its partners’ valuable \r\nsupport, the Government of Burundi is working to \r\nrespond to the needs of its most vulnerable citizens as \r\ninclusively as possible. We are working together with \r\nevery country on the planet to promote and implement \r\na sustainable, durable regime on climate, as well as a \r\nlegally binding instrument, and we must make sure we \r\nconsolidate the gains achieved on that epoch-making \r\nday of 21 December 2015. In a few months, Burundi \r\nwill join those countries that have already ratified the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nOn 13 October 1961 in Bujumbura, our then Prime \r\nMinister, His Royal Highness Louis Rwagasore, the \r\nhero of our independence, was assassinated by elements \r\nclose to the colonial administration as he presided \r\nover his first and last cabinet meeting. On 15 January \r\n1965, Pierre Ngendandumwe, our Prime Minister, \r\nwas gunned down in Bujumbura by a local embassy \r\nstaffer. On 21 October 1993, Melchior Ndadaye, the \r\nfirst democratically elected President of Burundi, was \r\nassassinated by army troops from one ethnic group. On \r\n13 May 2015, a bid to overthrow Burundi’s legitimate \r\ninstitutions failed. What all those sad events have \r\nin common, however, is the unhealthy and obvious \r\ninvolvement of foreign elements. And we should not \r\nforget that President Ntaryamira died in a foreign land \r\nwhen the plane carrying him and the then-President of \r\nRwanda was shot down on 6 April 1994. \r\nIn that regard, it is important to remember that \r\nAfrican societies are highly complex. What Burundi is \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n16/34 16-29817\r\nasking for is to be seen fairly, on its own terms, not \r\nthrough the lenses of other situations in other countries. \r\nWe do not welcome any kind of foreign interference in \r\nour affairs, because Burundi has been f lying the f lag of \r\na sovereign State since 1 July 1962, however difficult \r\nthat may be for some to understand.\r\nThree communities live in our beautiful land, \r\nbordered on the west by majestic Lake Tanganyika, the \r\nworld’s second deepest, and by two other countries to \r\nthe north and east. The Hutu, Tutsi and Twa peoples \r\nlive in harmony in Burundi and have an equal say \r\nin the affairs of Government, as provided for in the \r\nConstitution of the Republic of Burundi. No group is \r\nabove or below another. \r\nIt is crucial to take into account the suffering \r\nand pain that our people endured as a result of bad \r\nleadership in the past. The wounds left by the massacres \r\nof the past remind us to treat all our citizens the same \r\nway, with no distinctions between classes or groups. \r\nVictims know no majority or minority — their pain is \r\nthe same. We therefore refuse to manipulate or falsify \r\nhistory. Our citizens continue to mourn their loved \r\nones, lost to ignorance and the barbaric practices of \r\nthe military regimes that overthrew the monarchy and \r\nproclaimed a republic. For more than 40 years, the \r\nvarious Burundi Administrations in Burundi busied \r\nthemselves segregating and killing citizens on the basis \r\nof their ethnicity.\r\nThe Arusha Peace and Reconciliation Agreement \r\nof 2000 and our 2005 Constitution defined the place \r\nof all citizens in the country’s administration, in what \r\nwas seen to be an equitable way of ensuring peace and \r\nstability. Those tenets are still in place today, and the \r\nArusha Agreement is fully respected in our institutions. \r\nSimilarly, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission \r\nenvisaged in the Arusha Agreement has now been \r\nestablished. We therefore call on the United Nations to \r\nsupport the Commission’s work. The Barundi people \r\nnow have a forum that can address the sad events in their \r\nhistory. They need to know why their nation changed \r\nfrom being one in which different ethnic communities \r\nlived in harmony to one in which citizens lost their \r\nlives because of their ethnic origins. The process will \r\nenable us to tap into the knowledge resources of the \r\nUnited Nations, which entrusted the administration of \r\nBurundi to a third country.\r\nLastly, our people — the Hutu, the Tutsi and the \r\nTwa — want only to live in peace and harmony. They \r\nunanimously reject genocidal rhetoric. They form one \r\nsingle society, one nation. They share a faith in their \r\ncommon future, which they want to be peaceful and \r\nprosperous, one of equal opportunity. As President \r\nPierre Nkurunziza has said time and again, there \r\nwill be no genocide in the Republic of Burundi. That \r\nis our faith and the faith of all our people. And we, \r\nthe people of Burundi, will fight that evil with every \r\npossible means.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdusalam Hadliyeh Omer, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Investment Promotion of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Somalia.\r\nMr. Omer (Somalia): On behalf of my Government \r\nand my people, it is an honour and a privilege for me \r\nto address the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession. I bring warm greetings and good wishes from \r\nour President, His Excellency Mr. Hassan Sheikh \r\nMohamud, and our Prime Minister, Omar Abdirashid \r\nAli Sharmarke, our entire Government and the people \r\nof the Federal Republic of Somalia.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session, for his excellent \r\nleadership. I wish him well in all his duties.\r\nI also pay a special tribute to His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who has truly \r\nchampioned development across the world in all its \r\nforms. In his two terms as Secretary-General we \r\nhave seen a smooth transition from the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals to the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and the encouragement of greater, more \r\ninnovative cross-sectoral partnerships for achieving \r\nprogress for all. Whoever succeeds him as Secretary-\r\nGeneral certainly has big shoes to fill.\r\nThe United Nations is indeed the foremost \r\nplatform for nations of the world to come together as a \r\ncommunity of nations to discuss and tackle the greatest \r\nchallenges of our time. Those challenges are clear and \r\nrequire robust and coordinated international action to \r\novercome. No one nation, no matter how powerful or \r\nresourceful, can alone address the grave challenges \r\nposed by climate change, terrorism, poverty and the \r\nlarge movements of refugees and migrants, as well \r\nas conflict. More important, no one nation today can \r\nclaim that many of those great challenges are “not in \r\nmy backyard; therefore, I do not need to act”. In an age \r\nof globalization, interconnectivity and interdependence \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 17/34\r\nthere is a duty incumbent upon us all to work even more \r\nclosely together to protect and to advance the common \r\ninterests of all humankind.\r\nThe Government of Somalia is truly committed \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations and the values of \r\njustice, peace and progress for all. Furthermore, our \r\nGovernment is immersed in laying the groundwork \r\nfor the successful implementation of the crucial 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, with a focus on \r\npeace and security, good governance and economic and \r\nsocial development through innovative partnerships at \r\nhome. We are determined, in the interest of our mutual \r\nnational and regional development and progress, to \r\nensure that no one is left behind. Leaving people \r\nbehind, especially the most vulnerable in our societies, \r\nwould lead to incomplete progress and signify division \r\nand a lack of social solidarity among our peoples and \r\nwithin our nations.\r\nSomalia is a country that I dearly love, represent \r\nand serve. I am proud to say that all our partners, allies \r\nand friends across the world have recognized both \r\nthe potential and the strategic value of our country \r\nfor international security, trade and the promotion of \r\ndemocracy and good governance internationally. More \r\nimportant, during this week’s high-level meeting on \r\nSomalia, held on the margins of the General Assembly \r\nmeetings, the Government of the Federal Republic of \r\nSomalia and our key international partners exchanged \r\nviews on the current progress and the remaining \r\nchallenges in our country. I am glad to report that \r\nour partners have both recognized and pledged to \r\ncontinue supporting Somalia’s fruitful journey towards \r\ndemocratization, stability and sustainable development.\r\nSomalia is taking bold and unprecedented steps \r\ntowards a better future. That historic move towards \r\nprogress and empowerment is driven by our resilient \r\npeople, our determined central Government and all \r\nour valuable international partners. After nearly two \r\ndecades of difficulties and instability, Somalia has \r\nnegotiated a permanent turn towards progress and \r\nprosperity. We are writing a new chapter in our history, \r\none that is characterized by hope, inclusive governance \r\nand development.\r\nI am proud to say that our Government, in \r\ncooperation with our people and valuable partners, has \r\nmade tangible progress on the key issues of elections, \r\nthe configuration of the State, security and economic \r\ndevelopment. Despite our fruitful cooperation with, \r\nand gratitude to, our international partners and \r\nfriends, the Somali Government and the people take \r\nfull responsibility for their own future in every way. \r\nTherefore, the Somali Government and the people — \r\nthe ultimate stakeholders and beneficiaries of progress \r\nin the country — are stepping up to the many challenges \r\nso as to ensure that our country and people fulfil their \r\npotential and that of their beautiful and rich home.\r\nSomalia is winning the war against international \r\nterrorism at home and contributing to the creation of \r\na safer world through cooperation on security with \r\ninternational partners across the world. With the \r\nsupport of our brave Somali national security services \r\nand the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM), \r\nwe have militarily defeated the evil that is Al-Shabaab. \r\nDefeating international terrorism is a fundamental \r\npriority for Somalia, as those murderous criminals \r\npose a genuine threat to us all and our way of life. \r\nThe threat of terrorism is indeed international, as no \r\ncountry, regardless of its abilities, can insulate itself \r\nfrom that threat, given the new technologies and the \r\nf luidity of borders. Terrorism is truly a pointless evil \r\nwithout geography and without respect for the sanctity \r\nof human life. We can and must defeat it through \r\npartnerships across all international sectors. During \r\nthe past four years, the Somali National Army and \r\nAMISOM have regained key towns and cities across \r\nSomalia. Today Al-Shabaab controls less than 10 per \r\ncent of the territory of the country. In recent months \r\nmany of their key leaders have been eliminated. \r\nOthers have defected, and their violent ideology is \r\ntruly shunned by the Somali people. Somali national \r\nforces and AMISOM have proven that Al-Shabaab is \r\nvulnerable and divided, and can be defeated through \r\ncoordinated military action.\r\nAs a result of the success of the joint operations of \r\nthe Somali National Army and AMISOM, Al-Shabaab \r\nhas turned to small-team, asymmetric warfare tactics in \r\norder to conduct terrorist attacks against soft targets in \r\nSomalia and, increasingly, in neighbouring countries. In \r\nresponse, our Government is working with our partners \r\nand neighbours to enhance security cooperation so \r\nas to enable us to respond to the threat, together and \r\nswiftly. Whereas before 2012 Al-Shabaab was engaged \r\nin open warfare with the Somali armed forces and \r\nAMISOM, today they are limited to undertaking \r\ninfrequent, desperate and opportunistic suicide attacks \r\non mosques, hotels, restaurants and businesses, as well \r\nas carrying out the assassination of innocent citizens. \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n18/34 16-29817\r\nThat is the best evidence of their moral bankruptcy, \r\nideological falsehood and diminished capabilities.\r\nThe Federal Republic of Somalia and our people \r\nare grateful to the troop-contributing countries in \r\nAMISOM for their support in stabilizing our country. \r\nWe thank the brotherly States of Djibouti, Ethiopia, \r\nKenya, Uganda, Burundi and Nigeria for contributing \r\nto the AMISOM forces and the police contingent. \r\nWe fully recognize the sacrifices that their service \r\npersonnel have made, and continue to make, in the \r\nservice of Somalia and its people’s future. I can assure \r\nthe Assembly that their valour and distinguished service \r\nwill never be forgotten. In fact, it is and will always be \r\nhonoured in our national development.\r\nWhile we are grateful to AMISOM and our \r\ninternational partners for their diverse security-sector \r\nassistance, we fully understand that the only way we \r\ncan truly achieve long-term stability and development, \r\nboth in Somalia and across the region, is to have well-\r\ntrained, equipped and funded Somali national security \r\nforces, which we hope to achieve ahead of the agreed \r\ndeadline under which AMISOM will draw down in \r\n2018. From all of that, it should be clear that the Somali \r\nGovernment and the people are committed to, and \r\nare leading the creation of, a safer Somalia, region \r\nand world.\r\nOn the matter of countering violent extremism, \r\neffectively countering the poisonous ideologies of \r\nhate that radicalize vulnerable young people is crucial \r\nin order to achieve permanent peace in Somalia and \r\nacross the world. On 12 September His Excellency \r\nHassan Sheikh Mohamud, President of Somalia, \r\nofficially launched the national strategy and action plan \r\nfor preventing and countering violent extremism for \r\nSomalia. Somalia is pleased that that inclusive process, \r\nwhich began more than 10 months ago, has successfully \r\nconcluded with a comprehensive national strategy \r\nand action plan for preventing and countering violent \r\nextremism. The document is the result of a rigorous \r\nand inclusive process of dialogue and discussion with \r\nall the key stakeholders that lasted up to the point of \r\nits adoption by the Somali Government. The national \r\nstrategy and action plan for preventing and countering \r\nviolent extremism provides a holistic framework \r\nfor addressing domestic and international security \r\nthreats, including terrorism. With the completion of \r\nthat vital strategy, Somalia has now fulfilled the call of \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for each Member State \r\nto develop an action plan and strategy for preventing \r\nviolent extremism.\r\nThe Federal Government of Somalia, in \r\nconsultation with the federal states — which were \r\nall formed democratically starting in 2012, with one \r\ncurrently undergoing the process — has adopted a \r\ncredible, transparent and inclusive electoral mechanism \r\nthat we hope will pave the way for universal suffrage \r\nby 2020. The Somali people are excited by that positive \r\nmove towards democracy, and the various electoral \r\ncommissions, as well as the Somali people in general, \r\nare working tirelessly on the implementation of the \r\nelectoral mechanism in line with the agreed time line. \r\nAs I speak, many aspiring parliamentarians are \r\nreturning to their constituencies to win over voters so \r\nthat they can represent them in the next Parliament. \r\nBillboards depicting presidential hopefuls seeking to \r\nwin the hearts and minds of the Somali people line \r\nthe roads and streets ahead of the election. That is a \r\ntruly historic leap forward in terms of democratization \r\nin Somalia and provides clear evidence of the spirit \r\nand values of democracy taking shape in the country. \r\nThe Federal Government of Somalia is determined \r\nto ensure a smooth, peaceful, inclusive and enhanced \r\nelectoral process for a peaceful democratic transition \r\nin November. \r\nWe are also championing a 30 per cent quota \r\nfor women in Parliament, as their representation \r\nand political participation is central to our national \r\nprogress. Those actions most certainly constitute the \r\nfirst step towards the implementation of the 2020 \r\npolitical road map for universal suffrage in Somalia \r\nand the achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals by 2030. In Somalia we are not short of ambition \r\nor self-confidence. We are committed to achieving our \r\nState-building goals with equity and good governance \r\nas a crucial baseline. We are also determined to \r\nleave no one behind in our march forward towards a \r\nbetter tomorrow.\r\nI am sure that everyone appreciates the difficulties of \r\ntransitioning from conflict to inclusive governance and \r\ndevelopment. The Somali people and the Government \r\nare endeavouring to accomplish in just four years the \r\nkind of national transformation that took decades or \r\ncenturies for many countries. Despite the enormity of \r\nthe tasks ahead, we are committed and determined to \r\nsucceed in achieving progress and prosperity for our \r\npeople, the region and the world in general.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 19/34\r\nTurning to economic development, the Federal \r\nRepublic of Somalia fully acknowledges that achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, to which we \r\ncommitted last year at the General Assembly, is central \r\nto our overall progress. Realistically achieving at least \r\nsome of the Goals quickly and effectively, with a view to \r\nachieving the rest over the longer term, will ensure the \r\nsuccess of our overall national and regional agenda for \r\npeace, sustainable development and prosperity. To that \r\nend, we have developed an inclusive, people-centred \r\nand implementable national development plan, which \r\nwill act as a blueprint for achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals within the set time frame.\r\nThroughout the United Nations, many key \r\ndiscussions have focused on funding development \r\npriorities across the world, especially the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. In Somalia we fully understand \r\nand appreciate that the traditional aid model alone \r\ncannot ensure development and that it must be \r\ncomplemented by national contributions. In that spirit, \r\nand with the attainment of progress and prosperity for \r\nour people and region as a key driver, we have made \r\ninvestment promotion a central focus of Somali foreign \r\nand economic policy.\r\nSomalia is truly a rich nation, with the longest \r\ncoast in Africa. Seventy per cent of its population is \r\nunder 30 years of age. Our Government has passed one \r\nof the most competitive investment laws in the world, \r\nand we are ready to welcome and directly support all \r\ninvestors in each and every sector. In green energy, \r\nagriculture, infrastructure, telecommunications and \r\nthe blue economy, Somalia can become a world leader \r\nand a profitable home for investors and new enterprises, \r\nwith easy access to the African, Middle Eastern and \r\nFar Eastern markets. When the goal of investment is \r\nrealized, most of the issues that we face in connection \r\nwith illegal migration, large movements of refugees \r\nand poverty will be overcome in Somalia.\r\nRelying on partnerships and the great efforts of \r\nall, especially the Somali people themselves, Somalia \r\nhas turned the corner toward stability and progress. \r\nToday shops are open, schools are full and our markets \r\nare busy with traders and customers. More important, \r\nour diaspora is returning to invest and build our key \r\ninstitutions, and we thank those Governments and \r\norganizations that have encouraged and continue to \r\nactively encourage such activities. In the past year \r\nalone, Somalia achieved many milestones. We most \r\nrecently hosted the historic Extraordinary Summit of \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development Heads \r\nof State and Government in Mogadishu. We also \r\nsuccessfully undertook our first national secondary \r\nschool exams since the civil war — with the highest \r\nscore received by a bright young lady. We are \r\npositively contributing to the stability, progress and \r\ndevelopment of our region, continent and the world \r\nthrough partnerships.\r\nThrough diverse partnerships, we are also \r\nworking on getting Somali refugees to return home \r\nfrom Kenya voluntarily and with dignity so that they \r\ncan actively participate in the efforts to rebuild their \r\nnation. Somalia, more than any other nation today, \r\nrecognizes the importance of peacebuilding, which \r\nwill help to avert the international refugee crisis. We \r\nappreciate the valuable contribution that refugees make \r\nto their new and old homes through remittances and \r\ncultural education, which is crucial for promoting \r\ntolerance. We are determined to save vulnerable lives \r\nat sea and reverse the brain drain holding our national \r\nprogress hostage by striving to create at home the very \r\nopportunities that our people seek abroad.\r\nIt is impossible to forget the difficult past, but it is \r\nabsolutely possible and necessary to dedicate oneself \r\nand the nation to a better future. That is what we are \r\ngoing to do in Somalia. In that regard, hope, confidence \r\nand progress characterize the new Somalia and all its \r\npeople. There is no turning back now; we can only go \r\nforward together and in partnership with the region and \r\nthe rest of the world. As we take the significant and \r\nnecessary steps to confront the biggest challenges of \r\nour time as a community of nations, such as terrorism, \r\npoverty and large movements of refugees and migrants, \r\nwe can assure everyone that Somalia and its people will \r\nplay their part in the solutions.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mohamed Asim, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives.\r\nMr. Asim (Maldives): I wish to begin by \r\ncongratulating the President on his assumption of office. \r\nThe Maldives is proud to welcome a distinguished \r\ndiplomat from a fellow island State to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nI also wish to congratulate Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for all of his hard work over the past 10 years, \r\nand especially for his efforts on climate-change advocacy \r\nand sustainable development and his partnership with \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n20/34 16-29817\r\nsmall island developing States (SIDS). He is certainly \r\nleaving a legacy of enormous historical significance.\r\nRarely do we get an opportunity to come \r\ntogether — the whole world — for a moment of \r\ncollective agreement. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development was such a moment. It is an \r\nAgenda of hope, a blueprint for advancing humankind, \r\na plan for empowering the impoverished and a promise \r\nto future generations. The Agenda recognizes at its \r\ncore that all efforts to achieve development should \r\nbe holistic and that poverty is multidimensional. It \r\nrecognizes that differentiated responses are necessary, \r\neven if aspirations are universal. It recognizes that \r\ndevelopment efforts should include everyone and \r\naddress everyone.\r\nPresident Abdullah Yameen Abdul Gayoom’s \r\ndevelopment efforts aim to empower everyone so that all \r\nof society can share in the development dividends. We \r\nhave reached our current situation through sustained, \r\ncontinuous, and targeted investment in health and \r\neducation. \r\nWe find that the best way to sustain our \r\ndevelopmental gains is to focus on our people. That \r\nis why we have made it our aim to deliver easily \r\naccessible health care to every citizen — a feat that \r\nis extremely challenging for a population of 338,000 \r\npeople dispersed over 188 islands. It is why we have \r\nensured free health care, provided sea ambulances \r\non all 20 atolls and established a pharmacy on every \r\ninhabited island. It is why we have not stopped investing \r\nin education, despite achieving nearly 100 per cent \r\nliteracy. Rather, we have continued to invest in teacher \r\nquality, while continuously improving and updating \r\nour curriculums and our approach. It is why we aim \r\nto provide affordable social housing, especially to all \r\nvulnerable groups of our society. In that connection, \r\nwe aim to empower people with disabilities through \r\nfinancial and material support, such as the provision of \r\nhousing for those with disabilities. That is also why we \r\nhave chosen to focus on youth — improving their lives, \r\ntheir livelihood opportunities and their aspirations.\r\nInvesting in our people will put us on the right path. \r\nNo investment has higher returns than investments in \r\nwomen and girls. Empowering women and girls to \r\nmake their own choices and to determine the destiny \r\nof their choosing is not only the moral, responsible and \r\ncorrect choice to make; it is the smart decision to make. \r\nWomen constitute half of our population. They can, \r\nand should, contribute to our economy; they can, and \r\nshould, contribute to our society.\r\nWomen in the Maldives have had the right to \r\nvote since our first Constitution, in 1932. Women in \r\nthe Maldives have always been in our offices, in our \r\npolitics and in our society. They have always had equal \r\npay and equal rights, which is now enshrined in our \r\nConstitution. Today a woman in the Maldives can also \r\ngo to a court of law and use the newly adopted Gender \r\nEquality Act to claim those rights. They can challenge \r\ncases involving gender inequality, sexual harassment \r\nand sexual abuse with specifically defined laws to back \r\nthem up. We still have a long way to go — every country \r\ndoes — but we believe that we are on the right track to \r\nmaking institutional and structural changes that will \r\nbring about lasting and sustainable normative change.\r\nA much-celebrated feature of the 2030 Agenda is its \r\nuniversality. The Goals and targets apply to all nations; \r\nthey have been adopted by everyone. Yet embedded in \r\nthose common responsibilities is the reality of special \r\ncircumstances. Maldives is a small island developing \r\nState — a status that we cannot graduate from. \r\nOur islands are uniquely susceptible to economic, \r\nenvironmental and institutional shocks because we \r\nare so dependent on the rest of the world. Measures of \r\ndevelopment that are used to rank countries continue to \r\nignore that reality. Development status continues to be \r\ndetermined on the basis of gross domestic product per \r\ncapita. That system disadvantages smaller countries \r\nwith small populations. To escape the “island paradox,” \r\nwe need the international community to re-evaluate \r\nhow development is assessed. There needs to be a \r\nconcerted effort to integrate the economic vulnerability \r\nof countries into such assessments. Without such a \r\nre-evaluation, our approach to development will never \r\nbe holistic.\r\nThe fact that we have graduated from least-developed-\r\ncountry status does not mean that we have overcome \r\nour challenges. Large-scale infrastructure — ports, \r\nairports, hospitals, harbours — is still required across \r\nthe entire Maldives. Yet the large-scale financing \r\nneeded for those projects is not readily available \r\nbecause the preferential and concessional arrangements \r\nfor financing were lost after we graduated from least-\r\ndeveloped-country status. Those limitations make it \r\nharder to maintain and sustain the development gains \r\nthat enabled us to graduate in the first place.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 21/34\r\nThe Maldives is one of the countries that is most \r\nvulnerable to environmental shocks and one of the \r\nmost exposed to the impacts of climate change. Climate \r\nchange is an existential threat to our country. It has the \r\npotential to erode decades of development gains. For \r\ndecades, we have been advocating urgent action on \r\nclimate change and asking the world to take notice. As \r\na lone voice in a sea of sceptics, we were not necessarily \r\nheard. But today, together with the 43 members of the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States, we can can have a \r\ngreater impact. With 13 other SIDS, we, the Maldives, \r\nwere among the first ratifiers of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change. We know that our emissions \r\nare almost negligible. But we want the international \r\ncommunity to know that, small though we may be, we \r\nare making the choice to take action, and to take action \r\nnow. We want the international community to continue \r\nto invest in action to prevent climate change and in \r\nforging meaningful partnerships. Investing today is \r\nsaving tomorrow.\r\nWhile we continue to be alarmed by the realities \r\nof climate change, another crisis looms. That is the \r\nstate of our oceans. As a large-ocean State, our major \r\neconomic activities depend on the health and wealth \r\nof the oceans. We are concerned about them. As in \r\nmany situations, the issue at hand is one that needs a \r\ncollective response. One such opportunity is the United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14, on the sustainable \r\nuse of the oceans, which is to be held in June 2017. \r\nIt will provide an opportunity for the international \r\ncommunity to come together with renewed hope to find \r\nsolutions that can get the results we desire.\r\nAn overarching and cross-cutting theme across all \r\nthe agendas is investment — investing in our people, \r\ninvesting in our economies and investing in our \r\nenvironment. Above all, investment in our institutions \r\nis of the utmost importance. In order to implement \r\nambitious agendas, our institutions and governance \r\nstructures need to be sufficient and capable of \r\ndelivering the results we want. The Maldives has been \r\narguing for some time now that, unless small States \r\nare able to build strong institutions, they will not be \r\nable to build resilience in the spheres of economy and \r\nclimate change.\r\nWe began the process of democratization only a \r\ndecade ago. Informed by events and based on lessons \r\nlearned, our institutions are adapting and changing. \r\nInstitutions need space to form on their own. They need \r\nto develop organically and to evolve with the needs \r\nand priorities of our society. While a healthy amount \r\nof scrutiny is necessary and welcome, institutions \r\ncannot build resilience under a constant microscope. \r\nHowever, the Maldives will remain engaged with the \r\ninternational community.\r\nToday we have accepted that economic advancement \r\ngoes hand in hand with social development and \r\nenvironmental protection. I hope that we have all \r\naccepted the fact that development needs to be holistic \r\nand that problems and solutions have interlinked \r\nconsequences. The massive shift seen in provisions of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda reflects precisely that reality, that all \r\nissues are interlinked.\r\nIt is in that vein that we have accepted that there \r\ncan be no sustainable development without peace, \r\nand no peace without sustainable development. And \r\nnowhere is that more apparent than in Palestine. Cycles \r\nof violence and hatred perpetuated by the occupying \r\nPower, Israel, have led nowhere. A two-State solution \r\nthat offers peace, stability and security is the only \r\nsolution. Guaranteeing Palestinians the right to self-\r\ndetermination and sovereignty over their own land and \r\nnatural resources is the only way out of the conflict.\r\nA military solution is never the answer. Look at \r\nthe condition of Syria. Thousands of innocent children, \r\nmen and women have lost their lives to the conflict. \r\nHundreds more are f leeing for their lives, only to be \r\nturned away by the politics of fear. Fences and wires \r\ndo not stop violence; compassion and tolerance do. The \r\nrising tide of hatred, Islamophobia and xenophobia in \r\nthe name of security will lead only to more violence, as \r\nmore people feel more marginalized and more people \r\nfind more reasons for hatred. And radical elements \r\nof society find much to feed on in poverty, misery \r\nand victimization.\r\nWe live in a world marred by extreme acts carried \r\nout in the name of religion and extremist beliefs, which \r\ninstil fear in others. That is our reality. The Maldives \r\ncondemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. \r\nWe reject radicalism. We especially denounce all acts \r\nof violence carried out in the name of Islam, for they are \r\nnot only un-Islamic but anti-Islamic. We have passed \r\nlegislation to address foreign terrorist fighters. We have \r\nestablished the National Counter-Terrorism Centre. And \r\nnext month, we will also host an international seminar \r\non counter-terrorism and counter-radicalization.\r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n22/34 16-29817\r\nThe United Nations is still the best-placed \r\nOrganization to support the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. The knowledge, practices and \r\npower of convening that the United Nations draws \r\non are unmatched. Yet there is a recurring concern \r\nthat we hear — a concern that we ourselves have \r\nvoiced — namely, the need to increase representation \r\nin the main bodies of the United Nations. Small States \r\nsuch as the Maldives are often underrepresented, \r\nbecause our delegations are small and our capabilities \r\nare stretched. Every Member of the Organization must \r\nhave an opportunity to serve and have an equal chance to \r\nbe part of every body, especially the Security Council, \r\nin order to help make decisions that affect us all. We do \r\nnot believe that might or size should determine destiny. \r\nOur ability, our motivation, our will to work and our \r\nideas are more appropriate criteria.\r\nFor the first time since it joined the Organization, \r\n51 years ago, the Maldives has boldly put forward its \r\ncandidature to the Security Council for the 2019-2020 \r\nterm. That is because we believe that the opportunity \r\nshould be available to all and because we believe that \r\nwe can serve. We believe that intent, resolve, fairness \r\nand the principle of representation must decide \r\nsuch opportunities.\r\nIn an ever-changing world, that which defines \r\nsuccess for countries is the ability to adapt according to \r\nchanging needs. The resilience of countries, continued \r\ninvestment and continuous will to work are critical. \r\nAs a small island State, we face myriad challenges and \r\nvulnerabilities. But today we ask Members to value us \r\nbecause of our abilities, not our vulnerabilities. Evaluate \r\nour progress relatively, not against inapt benchmarks. \r\nWe may be small, but we surely can be significant.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Lyonpo Damcho Dorji, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Kingdom of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Dorji (Bhutan): At the outset, I have the honour \r\nto convey the warm greetings of His Majesty the King \r\nand the people of Bhutan. I congratulate the President on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session and assure him of my delegation’s \r\nfull support in the discharge of his responsibilities. His \r\ndistinguished predecessor, Mr. Morgens Lykketoft, \r\ndeserves our special appreciation for the excellent \r\nmanner with which he steered the work of the \r\nseventieth session.\r\nWe meet at a time defined by breakthrough \r\nagreements. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on \r\nfinancing for development and the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change stand as testimonies to our \r\ncollective resolve to advance peace, security, human \r\nrights and sustainable development. Those agreements \r\nunderscore our commitment to multilateralism and \r\nserve as a reaffirmation of our faith in the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations. Together they present \r\na historic opportunity to secure the collective hopes \r\nand aspirations of humankind.\r\nWe have undoubtedly made a good start on that \r\nmonumental journey. However, let us be clear that \r\nmany serious global challenges persist. We continue \r\nto witness wanton acts of terrorism and protracted \r\nconflicts that undermine the security, well-being and \r\nhuman rights of millions of people. Terrorism is the \r\nmost f lagrant violation of human rights, and we strongly \r\ncondemn terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. \r\nIt aff licts many nations and peoples, and the imperative \r\nto redouble international cooperation to combat that \r\nscourge is vital and urgent. Over the past five years, at \r\nleast 15 major conflicts have erupted around the world.\r\nMr. El Haycen (Mauritania), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nToday we are witnesses to the largest displacement \r\nof people f leeing violence and conflict since the \r\nfounding of the United Nations. The value of the arms \r\ntrade and global military expenditures has exceeded \r\nCold-War levels. The current stockpile of nuclear \r\nweapons is enough to destroy our planet hundreds of \r\ntimes over. That unimaginable destructive power still \r\nlooms as a grave threat. All of those facts serve as an \r\nacute reminder that our quest for peace and security \r\nremains unfulfilled.\r\nOn the development front, significant gaps and \r\nchallenges to successfully achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) confront us. For instance, \r\nthe Secretary General’s June 2016 report to the \r\nEconomic and Social Council on the SDGs highlights \r\n(E/2016/75) that one in eight people suffers from the \r\nabject despair of extreme poverty. About 800 million \r\npeople suffer from hunger. More than 2 billion are \r\naffected by water scarcity. And 1.1 billion people live \r\nwithout electricity. Thousands of children die every \r\nday, mainly from preventable causes. Children make up \r\nnearly half of the almost 900 million people living on \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 23/34\r\nless than $1.90 per day. About 124 million children do \r\nnot attend school, and two out of five leave primary \r\nschool without basic skills.\r\nMuch remains to be done to accelerate the rate of \r\nprogress in achieving gender parity and promoting the \r\nrights of women. We need to make concerted efforts \r\nto close the economic gap between men and women. \r\nLikewise, glaring inequalities within and among \r\nnations persist, despite substantial gains in global \r\neconomic output. And addressing the employment \r\nchallenge remains a daunting and complex task.\r\nThe risk of catastrophic climate change is no longer \r\nan abstract and long-term threat. Climate change is real, \r\nand countries in special situations, such as the least \r\ndeveloped countries (LDCs), landlocked developing \r\ncountries (LLDCs) and small island developing States \r\n(SIDS), are the most vulnerable. We have all experienced \r\nthe impact of climate change, which is devastating \r\nand destabilizing, as can be seen from the frequency \r\nand intensity of recent weather events. In July we in \r\nBhutan suffered extensive destruction and damage to \r\nproperty and infrastructure caused by unprecedented \r\nf lash f loods. Even as we deal with those long-standing \r\nchallenges, the digital revolution, while opening new \r\nfrontiers of opportunity by spurring global integration \r\nand catalysing a fourth industrial revolution, is ushering \r\nin new and interlocking challenges that have social, \r\npolitical, economic and security implications that we \r\nhave yet to fully comprehend.\r\nWe have to move past the euphoria of landmark \r\nagreements. Now more than ever before, we must \r\nfind new political resolve for urgent, focused and \r\ncomprehensive action that involves all stakeholders at \r\nthe national, regional and international levels — action \r\nthat translates agreements into real and meaningful \r\ndividends for all peoples and all countries.\r\nThe scale, scope and complexity involved in the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda should not be \r\nunderestimated, especially given the time frame of \r\nfewer than 15 years. The focus now and in the years \r\nahead must be on implementation. The principles and \r\nobjectives of the 2030 Agenda are consistent with \r\nBhutan’s national development framework based our \r\nconcept of Gross National Happiness. Guided by that \r\ntimeless vision propounded by our kings, we have \r\nalways ensured that peace, happiness and the well-\r\nbeing of our people remained at the core of all our \r\nendeavours. Formerly a closed subsistence economy \r\nwith no electricity or roads, Bhutan today is a rapidly \r\nemerging economy that aspires to achieve holistic \r\ndevelopment. With the accelerated development of our \r\nhydropower sector, the next 15 years are expected to \r\nusher in even greater transformation.\r\nBhutan has successfully aligned the SDGs with \r\nour national priorities and integrated them into our \r\ndevelopment-planning framework. The next decade will \r\nbe critical as we seek to consolidate development gains \r\nand work towards realizing our national development \r\ngoals of eradicating poverty, promoting inclusive and \r\nsustained economic growth, achieving self-reliance \r\nand eventually graduating from the least-developed-\r\ncountry category. We will continue to work in earnest \r\nto ensure the effective implementation of the SDGs, so \r\nthat we succeed in achieving the transformation that we \r\nall seek. That is particularly important, as Bhutan faces \r\nimmense challenges as an LDC and as a landlocked \r\ncountry. In that endeavour, the role of our development \r\npartners is critical.\r\nThe effectiveness of national strategies and \r\ninvestment plans, in both the formulation and the \r\nimplementation, depends on predictable commitments \r\nof financial, technical and policy support measures \r\nfrom development partners. Our partners’ emphasis \r\nneeds to shift from the expression of approximate broad \r\nsupport measures for the benefit of LDCs as a group \r\nto what is necessary at the country level. Financing \r\nfor development, particularly commitments to official \r\ndevelopment assistance, must be disaggregated at the \r\ncountry level, so that they can be expressed in national \r\nbudgets aimed at financing short-, medium- and long-\r\nterm investment plans. Without such predictability, it \r\nis impossible for LDCs to formulate the integrated and \r\neffective strategies and plans needed to achieve the \r\nSDGs. In that regard, allow me to share some of our \r\nexperiences, so as to illustrate how the predictability of \r\nfinancing allows for more ambitious plans.\r\nIn 1992, we established the Bhutan Trust Fund \r\nfor Environmental Conservation — the world’s first \r\nenvironmental trust fund — to protect our pristine \r\nenvironment and rich biodiversity through the \r\nimplementation of conservation programmes. Similarly, \r\nin 1998, we established the Health Trust Fund, which \r\ntoday sustainably finances the essential drug needs \r\nthat are fundamental to our free health-care system. \r\nRecently, in collaboration with the World Wildlife Fund, \r\nwe launched the Bhutan for Life Project, an innovative \r\nfinancing initiative based on a project-financing-\r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n24/34 16-29817\r\nfor-permanence model. Funds generated through the \r\nproject will be used to maintain and manage Bhutan’s \r\nprotected areas, parks and biological corridors in \r\nperpetuity, as well as to promote sustainable livelihoods \r\nfor the communities in the area. We hope to expand that \r\ninnovative financing model with development partners \r\nto cover other critical sectors such as sustainable \r\nenergy, education and infrastructure development.\r\nThe success of the 2030 Agenda will ultimately \r\nhinge on the quality of partnerships involving \r\nGovernments, the private sector and civil society at \r\nthe national, regional and global levels. Partnerships \r\nin innovative financing for development will be vital \r\nfor groups of countries in special situations, namely, \r\nthe LDCs, LLDCs and SIDS. We look forward to the \r\ncontinued support of our development partners and \r\nwell-wishers.\r\nBhutan’s commitment and contributions to the \r\nconservation and preservation of the environment, \r\nthe protection of biodiversity and the mitigation of \r\nclimate change have been widely acknowledged. That \r\ncommitment dates back more than two decades, when \r\nwe took a deliberate decision to shift our forest policy \r\naway from revenue generation towards environmental \r\nprotection by banning the export of raw timber, despite \r\nour limited resources. Furthermore, in 2008, we pledged \r\nto safeguard our forests through a constitutional \r\nmandate that requires maintaining a minimum of \r\n60 per cent of our land under forest cover in perpetuity. \r\nToday, 75 per cent of our land is covered in forest, and \r\n38 per cent of our total land area has been designated \r\nas national protected areas. In 2009, we committed to \r\nremaining carbon neutral, but in reality we are carbon \r\nnegative, and we look forward to ratifying the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change upon completion of \r\ninternal processes.\r\nEffective multilateralism requires an effective \r\nUnited Nations — one that is fit for the purpose. \r\nSince the founding of the United Nations, the world \r\nhas undergone profound changes. Its membership has \r\nincreased fourfold, and the challenges we face have \r\nbecome more complex. Institutions cannot be static. \r\nThey must evolve and adapt, so as to remain relevant \r\nand effective. The United Nations and its principal \r\norgans must be reformed in keeping with contemporary \r\nrealities — in particular the Security Council, so as \r\nto make the Council more representative, transparent \r\nand accountable and to enhance its legitimacy and \r\ncredibility. Similarly, the 2030 Agenda requires a \r\nUnited Nations development system that is able to \r\ndeliver integrated and coordinated policy support. \r\nIn that regard, it is essential to achieve an ambitious \r\noutcome to the new quadrennial comprehensive policy \r\nreview of operational activities for development of \r\nthe United Nations system — one that matches the \r\nambitions of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nBhutan has been blessed with peace, progress \r\nand stability under the enlightened leadership of our \r\nmonarchs. We embraced democracy in a unique manner, \r\nas it was imposed on us by our kings and not born out \r\nof popular unrest or strife. I am pleased to state that \r\nour transition to democracy is on a firm footing, with \r\ndemocratic institutions in place, supported by a vibrant \r\nand independent media.\r\nPeace and security is a shared concern and \r\nresponsibility. Bhutan is committed to supporting \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping endeavours to maintain \r\npeace, protect civilians and create the conditions \r\nnecessary for lasting and durable solutions to \r\nconflicts around the world. Despite our limitations \r\nand constraints, we joined the fraternity of troop- \r\nand police-contributing countries in 2014. That is a \r\nreflection of our commitment to share the burden along \r\nwith other Member States. Today, we have a presence in \r\n10 peacekeeping missions, and we hope to broaden and \r\ndeepen our peacekeeping engagement in the coming \r\nyears.\r\nAs Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon completes his \r\ntenure in December, I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto express my profound gratitude and appreciation to \r\nhim for his leadership, service and contributions to the \r\nimportant work of the United Nations. We wish him and \r\nhis family every success in all their future endeavours.\r\nSecond chances are rare in life. The agreements \r\nthat we adopted in 2015 have given us an extraordinary \r\nopportunity to bring about greater peace, progress and \r\nprosperity for all. History will judge us by our ability to \r\ntranslate those compacts into meaningful and concrete \r\nresults. Let us not squander this historic opportunity.\r\nAddressing our peace, security and sustainable \r\ndevelopment challenges requires global action, \r\nunderpinned by the solidarity of all Member States \r\nand bound together by a strong esprit de corps at the \r\nUnited Nations. In that context, I would like to end with \r\na quote by His Majesty the King of Bhutan:\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 25/34\r\n“Individual or even national success is a ship that \r\ncannot carry everyone together to the same place \r\nat the same time. Rich nations must stop and be \r\nmindful of the poorer ones left behind. Successful \r\npeople must stop and remember those who did \r\nnot make it. No nation today can stand alone in \r\nachievement. Time is slowly telling us that there can \r\nbe no lasting individual success without success as \r\na community, and there cannot be lasting national \r\nprogress and success if it does not fit into a future \r\nof global peace, harmony and equality. The world \r\nmust progress together or fail together.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Elvin Nimrod, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs, Legal Affairs, Carriacou and Petite \r\nMartinique Affairs and Local Government of Grenada\r\nMr. Nimrod (Grenada): I am pleased to extend the \r\nusual warm greetings from the Government and the \r\npeople of Grenada, on whose behalf I am privileged to \r\naddress the General Assembly and its members. I am \r\nalso pleased to join colleagues who spoke before me in \r\nthanking the President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventieth session, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, \r\nfor his energetic and focused leadership. I commend \r\nMr. Lykketoft for so diligently charting the course \r\ntowards transforming our world through the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nI must also congratulate and thank Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his extraordinary leadership \r\nof the United Nations, and express our deep gratitude, \r\nespecially for the keen interest he has shown in \r\naddressing the developmental challenges facing small \r\nisland developing States. I also wish to assure the \r\nincoming President, Ambassador Peter Thomson of \r\nFiji, of my delegation’s full cooperation and support \r\nas he encourages cooperation under this session’s \r\ntheme: that is,“The Sustainable Development Goals: a \r\nuniversal push to transform our world”.\r\nAllow me to use this rostrum to recognize the \r\ncontribution of a gigantic Grenadian personality who \r\npassed away this week — Sir Lamuel Stanislaus, who \r\nserved Grenada, the region and the Organization with \r\ndistinction and honour for over a decade as Grenada’s \r\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations and \r\none year as Vice-President of the General Assembly. \r\nSir Lamuel was the embodiment of diplomacy and \r\nstatesmanship. His contributions transcend nationality, \r\ngeography and subject matter. His was an eloquent \r\nand convincing voice in this Hall, addressing issues \r\non behalf of his country and his region. May his soul \r\nrest in peace. I believe it is ironic that that very noble \r\ngentleman was buried today, the same day in which \r\nGrenada addresses the Assembly.\r\nGrenada unwaveringly recommits to the United \r\nNations and its principles, as outlined in the Charter. \r\nOur commitment to the norms of peace, equality, \r\njustice, human rights and multilateralism is clear. At \r\nhome, Grenada continues to embrace opportunities \r\nto consolidate democratic values and practices in \r\ncivic life. I am proud to inform the Assembly that on \r\n27 October, Grenadians’ voices will be heard on the \r\nmatter of broad constitutional reform.\r\nI hail from the tiny island of Carriacou, which, \r\ntogether with Petite Martinique, forms my constituency \r\nand part of mainland Grenada, and makes up our tri-\r\nisland State. One of the possible results of the upcoming \r\nreferendum could be a change in the name of the State \r\nso as to better represent the collective identity of our \r\nnation.\r\nThe reforms also include amendments to the Bill \r\nof Fundamental Rights and Freedoms, which would \r\nguarantee access to public education to every Grenadian \r\nchild up to 16 years of age, and would further ensure that \r\nchildren with disabilities are afforded public education \r\ntailored to their specific needs up to age 18.\r\nGrenada is committed to Goal 5 of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), which speaks to gender \r\nequality and discrimination against women and girls. \r\nThe reforms also call on the State to ensure that \r\nmen and women enjoy equal rights and status in all \r\nspheres of life, especially in economic, educational, \r\npolitical, civic and social activities; that women are \r\nnot discriminated against by reason of marital status, \r\npregnancy or any other gender-based attribute; and that \r\nParliament can enact suitable laws to correct disparities \r\nand inequalities between men and women.\r\nWe live in a world that is plagued with many \r\nchallenges: civil wars, famine, droughts, f loods, the \r\nimpacts of climate change, humanitarian and economic \r\ncrises, and terrorism. But we also built the United \r\nNations for the express purpose of addressing such \r\nchallenges. The United Nations was built to steer us \r\naway from anarchy and perpetual antagonism.\r\nWith the 17 Sustainable Development Goals we \r\nhave created a new pathway to achieve a more equitable \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n26/34 16-29817\r\nand lasting brand of development. That pathway is \r\npaved with clean energy, universal access to education, \r\naffordable health care, food security, clean water and \r\nair, and gender and racial equality. History has shown \r\nthat development is tenuous whenver human rights and \r\nthe environment are not prioritized. The 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals are the product of deep reflection \r\nand learning, and the realization that development \r\nwithout human rights and environmental considerations \r\nis unreliable. \r\nDespite the remarkable progress made on each of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals, the fact that at \r\nleast $2.5 trillion will be needed each year for the SDGs \r\nsignals the size of the gap that remains to be addressed.\r\nGrenada is resolute in its commitment to \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14, on the conservation \r\nand promotion of the sustainable use of the oceans, \r\nseas and marine resources. Earlier this year, Grenada \r\nhosted Blue Week 2016. That conference was held in \r\ncollaboration and partnership with the Governments \r\nof the Netherlands and Indonesia and with the United \r\nNations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the \r\nWorld Bank, the Global Forum on Oceans, Coasts and \r\nIslands, the Clinton Climate Initiative, the Caribbean \r\nChallenge Initiative and The Nature Conservancy. At \r\nthat event, we employed the innovative and popular \r\n“shark-tank” approach, which allowed local and \r\ninternational ocean entrepreneurs to pitch project ideas \r\nfor funding. The rationale was that we cannot continue \r\nto merely talk about problems at ocean conferences; we \r\nneed to facilitate solutions and commitments for the \r\nsustainable development and use of our oceans. \r\nThe ocean economy is a very important starting \r\npoint for thinking about conservation. The natural \r\ncapital of the ocean is like the principal deposited in an \r\ninterest-bearing bank account. Unfortunately, instead \r\nof living off the interest, we have been drawing down \r\nfrom the principal.\r\nThe work done by World Wide Fund for Nature \r\nInternational and the Boston Consulting Group on \r\nthe Ocean Economy has described the estimated \r\n$24 trillion asset value of the oceans, which generates \r\nsome $2.5 trillion per year. The need to preserve that \r\nnatural capital is self evident. But when we consider \r\ndata provided by the World Bank and FAO, we see \r\nthat the world is losing $83 billion per year from \r\nunsustainable fisheries practices. Nine Caribbean \r\nnations have committed to conserving and managing \r\n20 per cent of their marine and coastal environments by \r\n2020. I am pleased to note that Grenada has committed \r\nto conserving 25 per cent of its coastal area and marine \r\nresources by 2020. Both of those commitments are well \r\nabove target 5 of Goal 14 of the SDGs, which calls for \r\n10 per cent conservation by 2020.\r\nSmall island nations in the Caribbean and the Pacific \r\nmust be lead advocates for oceans and climate change. \r\nMost of us have more space in the sea than we do on \r\nland. In Grenada, for instance, our maritime territory \r\nis 75 times our land mass. The ratios are even higher \r\nfor other archipelagoes. That is why Grenada is pleased \r\nto play a leading role, not only in the Blue Network, but \r\nalso in the Blue Guardians, facilitated by the Clinton \r\nFoundation and the Global Island Partnership initiatives \r\nfor islands. We invite other countries to partner with us \r\nand participate in both.\r\nGrenada is also helping the Blue Network create an \r\nonline database and platform for ocean-related projects \r\nseeking funding. That initiative, called BluNet, will \r\nbe showcased at Oceans Day during the twenty-\r\nsecond Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be held \r\nin November this year in Marrakesh, Morocco.\r\nFinancing difficulties and our small size severely \r\naffect our ability to invest in renewable energy projects. \r\nToday Grenada calls on Member States, especially the \r\nones that possess the technology and technical capacity, \r\nto continue to work with small island developing \r\nStates so as to increase their ability to harness existing \r\nrenewable energy opportunities.\r\nGrenada is almost 100 per cent reliant on imported \r\nfossil fuels for electricity generation. As a result, our \r\ndevelopment is held hostage to global price f luctuations \r\nand the high cost of electricity generation. We therefore \r\ncall for easier access to the Green Climate Fund to \r\nsupport renewable energy projects in small island \r\ndeveloping States. \r\nIn that regard, Grenada calls for a commitment \r\nfrom world leaders to deposit their instruments of \r\nratification of the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nby the end of 2016. We hope that the twenty-second \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties, which will be \r\nheld  in about six weeks, will build on the gains of the \r\nprevious session and garner the necessary momentum to \r\nenable the full implementation of the Paris Agreement.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 27/34\r\nGrenada further calls upon the international \r\ncommunity to work with Grenada and other small \r\nisland developing States on innovative approaches to \r\ninternational climate financing, which would include \r\ncatalysing private investment.\r\nLike many small island developing States, we \r\nsuffer from debt overhang, which limits the fiscal \r\nspace needed to address climate challenge. While \r\nthe International Monetary Fund has consistently \r\nexpressed satisfaction with Grenada’s response aimed \r\nat addressing the structural deficiencies that are both \r\na symptom and a cause of that overhang, that response \r\nhas, unfortunately, required a huge sacrifice on the part \r\nof our citizens, who are already suffering from climate \r\nchange, fossil fuel dependence and the financial crisis. \r\nThose three problems compound one another and \r\ncollectively limit our ability to invest in climate action \r\nthat can actually alleviate all three issues, which has \r\ncreated a vicious circle.\r\nWorking with partners, Grenada will optimize \r\nvarious leadership platforms to create practical, concrete \r\ninitiatives to turn that vicious circle into a virtuous one, \r\nwhere climate action can catalyse a wave of public and \r\nprivate investment that can alleviate all three problems. \r\nSuch measures would help small States like Grenada, \r\nCarriacou and Petite Martinique take action to combat \r\nclimate change and its impacts in areas such as potable \r\nwater supply, renewable energy and energy efficiency, \r\nclimate-smart agriculture, climate-resilient homes and \r\nbuildings and resilient coasts and oceans, to name a \r\nfew. Those are the developments that our people are \r\ndemanding, not for tomorrow but for today. When we \r\nobserve the climate changes in our world today and \r\ntheir effects on humankind, we owe it to ourselves and \r\nsucceeding generations to act with immediacy — we \r\nmust act now.\r\nAs we attempt to transform our world, we are \r\nconfronted with certain global financial policies and \r\nactions that pose significant threats to our region’s \r\nsustainable development. Exclusion from correspondent \r\nbanking services and de-risking, blacklisting and \r\npremature graduation to middle-income status are \r\nmeasures that negatively affect Caribbean economies. \r\nThe unilateral and premature graduation of many \r\nsmall island developing States to middle-income \r\nstatus without consideration of our region’s specific \r\nvulnerabilities has resulted in significant budgetary \r\nshortfalls, adversely affecting our economic and \r\nsocial development.\r\nOur region has inherent structural economic \r\nchallenges that already restrict the pace of our \r\ndevelopment. We ask that those impediments to growth \r\nbe taken into account when our cases come up for \r\nconsideration. Indeed, the current formula generalizes \r\nwhere generalizations should not be made. Outside of \r\nper capita gross domestic product (GDP), the intragroup \r\ndifferences among countries with middle-income status \r\nare astounding. Economists today admit that inequality \r\nhad not been treated with any depth until very recently. \r\nEconomists also readily admit that GDP is an imperfect \r\nmeasure of development.\r\nThe withdrawal of correspondent banking services \r\nfrom Caribbean Community member States can be seen \r\nas an economic assault that will destabilize the financial \r\nsector of our already vulnerable economies. For small \r\neconomies like ours, the impact could be enormous. To \r\ngive one example, the World Bank has indicated that \r\nmore than 90 per cent of remittances are transferred \r\nthrough correspondent banking services. Remittances \r\ncontribute in real and significant terms to the GDP of \r\nsmall nation-States. The World Bank goes on to state \r\nthat a sudden stop in remittances in economies that rely \r\non those f lows could pose a significant threat to the \r\nsocioeconomic stability of the region.\r\nGrenada applauds the progress made in the \r\nrecent rapprochement between Cuba and the United \r\nStates. Grenada sees the peaceful resolution of some \r\nof the issues in those relations through dialogue as \r\nan example to be emulated between and among all \r\nStates where violence, conflicts or disputes prevail. \r\nGrenada reiterates that it neither promulgates, applies \r\nnor condones laws or measures that encroach upon or \r\nundermine the sovereign rights of any State, nor laws \r\nthat restrict or hinder international trade or navigation \r\nby any State. Consequently, we issue another clarion \r\ncall for the total lifting of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed on the Government and \r\nthe people of Cuba by the United States of America.\r\nAs we forge ahead, it is important to bear in mind \r\nthat poverty is multidimensional in nature and that \r\nits implications for our youth and women go beyond \r\nthe concepts of income or consumption. The problems \r\naffecting our youth cannot be resolved only by \r\naddressing unemployment and poor working conditions \r\nwe must also provide access to health care and decent \r\nopportunities. We must ensure that we are building \r\nthe necessary skills and knowledge for that group \r\nto undertake economic activities, with an emphasis \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n28/34 16-29817\r\non vocational training, entrepreneurial skills and \r\ninnovation for our young people.\r\nWe recognize the importance of regional \r\ncooperation and international partnerships in \r\naddressing the scourge of non-communicable diseases. \r\nWe are adopting a holistic approach by utilizing the \r\nUnited Nations system, the World Health Organization \r\nand the Pan American Health Organization to provide a \r\nbasis for the health agenda and to guide us forward. Of \r\nparticular importance is assistance in addressing our \r\ncapacity constraints, facilitating knowledge-sharing \r\nand allowing the use of innovative approaches that \r\ncould be adapted to the needs of our country. President \r\nObama, in his address to the Assembly a few days ago \r\n(see A/71/PV.8), reiterated that the health issues that we \r\ncurrently face respected no walls or boundaries. Let us \r\ntherefore pool our collective energy and resources to \r\nbuild capacity to rid humankind of those scourges.\r\nGrenada continues its clarion call for a negotiated \r\ntwo-State settlement between Israel and Palestine. No \r\nmatter what road is taken, the end result must enable \r\nthe full economic, social, political and religious self-\r\ndetermination of the Palestinian people. Grenada \r\nrecognizes the struggles of the Palestinian people \r\nand beseeches the international community to reject \r\nmere political pragmatism and the status quo while \r\ngenerations are being lost.\r\nThe United Nations membership must make Article \r\n1, paragraph 3, of the Charter of the United Nations \r\na major priority in the next few years. Our founding \r\nfathers called for the Organization to\r\n“achieve international co-operation in solving \r\ninternational problems of an economic, social, \r\ncultural, or humanitarian character, and in \r\npromoting and encouraging respect for human \r\nrights and for fundamental freedoms for all without \r\ndistinction as to race, sex, language or religion”.\r\nWe must do everything in our power to provide \r\nadditional economic opportunities for the developing \r\nworld. I therefore call on the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil to actively pursue efforts to create an \r\nenvironment that enables Member States to raise the \r\nstandard of living of their peoples. In our current global \r\ncontext, we must be conscious that inclusion in the \r\nglobal economy is vital.\r\nFinally, I must recall Article 1, paragraph 1, of the \r\nCharter, which calls for the Organization to\r\n“maintain international peace and security, and to \r\nthat end: to take effective collective measures for \r\nthe prevention and removal of threats to the peace”.\r\nWe must be relentless in our pursuit of the aims of \r\nthe Organization. Our challenge is to work towards the \r\nelimination of terrorism, terrorist activities and armed \r\nconflicts around the world. Our quest must be to create \r\neconomic opportunities for all States. And our goal \r\nshould be the peaceful coexistence of all peoples of the \r\ninternational community. Indeed, if we can achieve that, \r\nwe will be well on our way to transforming our world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Isselkou Ould Ahmed Izid Bih, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Mauritania.\r\nMr. Bih (Mauritania) (spoke in Arabic): It is \r\na great honour for me to begin by congratulating \r\nMr. Peter Thomson on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. \r\nI wish him every success in the noble task that has \r\nbeen conferred upon him. I would like to express our \r\ngratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for all the hard work \r\nhe undertook during his presidency at the seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nI also with to take this opportunity to underscore \r\nthe tireless work undertaken by Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon in the service of peace and security. His skills, \r\nleadership and ability to keep a close eye on the major \r\nproblems facing our planet and to react accordingly \r\nhave enabled us to foster a spirit of tolerance, mutual \r\nunderstanding and cooperation at the international level.\r\nMauritania, under President Mohamed Ould Abdel \r\nAziz, is playing a crucial role in the maintenance of \r\npeace and security in the Sahel and Sahara regions \r\nthrough an approach based on openness, dialogue and \r\nprofessionalism. Despite a complex regional backdrop, \r\nour efforts have been successful, in particular in the \r\nfight against several terrorist groups and organizations, \r\nfollowing lengthy struggles throughout 2010 and 2011.\r\nExperts agree nonetheless that Mauritania \r\nrepresents an exception in terms of its success in \r\nfighting terrorism and extremist violence. Having \r\nmanaged to quash these effectively since 2011, we have \r\nalso reinforced our security and defence capabilities \r\nwithout undermining individual or collective liberties \r\nand freedoms. We have continued to focus our full \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 29/34\r\nattention on sustainable development and the needs of \r\nthose who are most vulnerable within society.\r\nAccording to Reporters Without Borders, \r\nMauritania has been ranked first among all Arab \r\nnations in terms of freedom of expression and freedom \r\nof the press for three years now. Furthermore, according \r\nto a recent United Nations Development Programme \r\n(UNDP) report, Mauritania is the leading country in the \r\nsubregion in the UNDP Human Development Index. We \r\nhave succeeded in guaranteeing and ensuring freedom \r\nof expression and the right to protest, demonstrate and \r\nassemble, meaning that we escaped unscathed from the \r\nso-called Arab Spring, which aff licted so many of our \r\nArab brothers. \r\nWe have maintained open channels of dialogue \r\nbetween the majority Government and the opposition \r\nsince the elections in 2011. That has allowed us \r\nto undertake profound regulatory and legislative \r\nreforms, particularly regarding the empowerment of \r\nMauritanian women and the strengthening of the values \r\nof citizenship, respect for others and social harmony.\r\nIt is our belief that security and development are \r\nintrinsically linked, which is why we have adopted a \r\nvery robust policy to tackle corruption, particularly \r\nwith regard to public expenditure and procurement. We \r\nhave also set in motion a series of initiatives to root \r\nout corruption in the private sector. That has allowed \r\nus to raise the necessary funds to increase our security \r\nand also create youth employment opportunities. That \r\nrational and judicious policy has led to unprecedented \r\nprogress and development in many economic sectors. \r\nInfrastructure, roads, ports, hospitals and universities \r\nhave undergone major construction programmes, and \r\nthere have been improvements in electricity production \r\nthanks to our use of both traditional and renewable \r\nenergy resources. We have also increased the number \r\nof homes with direct access to safe drinking water, \r\nparticularly for families that have been living in shanty \r\ntowns for more than 50 years.\r\nMauritania straddles the Arab Mahgreb world and \r\nthe Saharan world, with a long Atlantic coastline on \r\none border and the Sahara desert on another. Because \r\nof our geographical location, we are a key player in \r\nthe security and economic panorama of West Africa. \r\nIt is our desire to create harmony and understanding \r\nbetween the subregions to which we belong — the \r\nMahgreb and sub-Saharan Africa — through a policy \r\nof good neighbourliness. We have adopted a neutral \r\npolicy by way of response to the various conflicts in \r\nour region and with regard to the conflict in Western \r\nSahara. It has always been our desire to remain neutral \r\nand support the efforts of the United Nations to find \r\na permanent solution to the Western Sahara conflict. \r\nIt is a conflict that is holding back integration and \r\ndevelopment in our region, and there is an urgent need \r\nto solve it.\r\nOur credibility on a continental level was reflected \r\nduring our presidency of the African Union in 2014. \r\nWe also presided over the African Union Peace and \r\nSecurity Council in 2014, when we led and participated \r\nin many intiatives, especially in seeking to resolve the \r\ncrises in Côte d’Ivoire, Libya, Mali and Burundi, to \r\nname but a few places. I am sure the Assembly recalls \r\nthe courageous act of our President himself when he \r\nlanded in Kidal, Mali, in a helicopter in 2014 during \r\na period when the town was ravaged by conflict. Such \r\na courageous act paved the way to the renewal of \r\ndirect negotiations between the parties to the conflict. \r\nFurthermore, Mauritania is home to more than 60,000 \r\nMalian refugees in the Mbera camp in the east of \r\nthe country.\r\nDespite our scarcity of material and human \r\nresources as well as of natural resources, and \r\nnotwithstanding the sensitivity of our geopolitical \r\nsituation, we have contributed to many peacekeeping \r\noperations upon the request of the United Nations. \r\nWe have deployed contingents in Côte d’Ivoire and \r\nthe Central African Republic, and the leaders of those \r\nmissions have all spoken warmly of the professionalism \r\nand ethical behaviour of the Mauritanian troops. \r\nFurthermore, it gives me pleasure to say that members \r\nof the Mauritanian gendarmerie units deployed in the \r\nCentral African Republic were awarded medals today \r\nby the United Nations.\r\nMauritania took the lead in organizing the Group \r\nof Five for the Sahel, with Chad, Niger, Burkina Faso, \r\nMali and Mauritania as members, and we are honoured \r\nto currently occupy the post of Secretary-General of \r\nthe Group. It is our responsibility to coordinate the \r\nactions of these five countries in matters of security \r\nand good governance, while focusing in particular \r\non the needs of the most remote and least populated \r\nareas. We have developed various programmes and \r\ninitiatives, which have drawn the favourable attention \r\nof our international partners.\r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n30/34 16-29817\r\nMauritania warmly welcomed the opportunity to \r\nhost the latest Arab Summit. Despite the short notice \r\nand the complex set of circumstances currently faced \r\nby the Arab region, we were nonetheless glad to take \r\non that responsibility. We are convinced that, whatever \r\nthe differences may be among our countries, each Arab \r\nSummit provides a valuable opportunity to bring about \r\nreconciliation between our countries and to brainstorm \r\nabout our present and our future together. This very \r\nwell-organized Summit produced some excellent \r\nresolutions, and we believe it sent a strong message, \r\nreceived in many countries, to all who seek to hold \r\nArab brotherhood responsible for the propagation of \r\nunacceptable messages and for wreaking havoc.\r\nWe feel that we bear responsibility towards the \r\ngreater Arab nation. That is why we attach a great deal \r\nof importance to the rights of the Palestinian people and \r\ntheir right to enjoy dignity and sovereignty as a State. \r\nThe Palestines have a right to an independent State with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital. It is our belief that the \r\nongoing violations of human rights in Palestine and in \r\nother Arab territories occupied by Israel serve only to \r\nincrease instability and further provoke the spread of \r\nviolent extremism and terrorism throughout the world.\r\nWe would like to address all the parties to the \r\nbloody conflicts in countries such as Yemen, Libya \r\nand Syria, our brother Arab nations. We ask them to \r\nchoose the path of wisdom with the best interests of \r\ntheir people at heart. We live in a global village where it \r\nis no longer possible to end conflict by military means, \r\nhowever strong an army might be.\r\nThe principle of the judicial immunity of States is \r\na cornerstone of our international system, yet terrorism \r\nand violent extremism, together with drug trafficking, \r\npose major challenges to international peace, security \r\nand order. Hence, States must develop synergies and \r\njoin forces to tackle those challenges and overcome \r\nthem together. Any national legislation that runs \r\ncounter to international law, particularly as concers \r\nthe judicial immunity of States, will undermine the \r\nefforts by the international community to tackle the \r\naforementioned scourges.\r\nClimate change is also a major threat to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, particularly in the regions of the Sahel and \r\nthe Sahara. Mauritania, as is the case for many countries \r\nin the subregion, must face that problem squarely. Since \r\nthe desert sands of the Sahara cover much of our country’s \r\nsurface, environmental issues must necessarily cut \r\nacross all aspects of our national policies, particularly \r\nthose relating to economic development, if we are to \r\npursue sustainable development. We have been able \r\nto limit the phenomenon of desertification. Thanks \r\nto our efforts and to the sponsorship of the President \r\nof the Republic of Mauritania, we have engaged in a \r\ntree-planting programme throughout the country to \r\nreverse the process of desertification. Our natural \r\nresources have also been included in an effective \r\nprotection mechanism. Mauritania was chosen to host \r\nthe Panafrican Agency of the Great Green Wall, an \r\nambitious project of the African Union Commission \r\nthat covers approximately 7,000 kilometres from west \r\nto east, linking the Atlantic coast with the Red Sea, in \r\nthe fight against environmental degradation.\r\nWe have also been carefully protecting our fish \r\nstocks for future generations. We look favourably \r\non the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and it is \r\nour cherished hope that all parties will respect their \r\ncommitments under it.\r\nMauritania aspires to the full implementation of \r\nan inclusive and ambitious work plan for cities and \r\nurban spaces that will f lesh out the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development with its 17 Goals and its 169 \r\ntargets. The modernization of our cities and towns \r\nwill provide decent living standards for inhabitants \r\nand will ensure that social inclusion is tailored to the \r\nrequirements of each individual and each setting. It is \r\nimportant to ensure that social development planning \r\nmeets the need for dignity and decent living standards \r\nin urban spaces. We hope that Habitat III, to be held \r\nin October in Quito, will be a success and fully reflect \r\nthe aspirations and hopes of our people. Our desire \r\nis to be able to achieve a holistic and comprehensive \r\nsolution that strikes a balance between urban and rural \r\nliving conditions.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We have \r\nheard the last speaker on the list of speakers in the \r\ngeneral debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind \r\nmembers that, in accordance with decision 34/401, \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first statement and to five minutes \r\nfor the second, and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMrs. Özgür (Turkey): Turkey’s position on Syria \r\nwith regard to the political and humanitarian aspects \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 31/34\r\nwas shared on the first day of the general debate with \r\nrepresentatives at the highest political levels of United \r\nNations membership (see A/71/PV.8). I have nothing to \r\nadd to that position. I wish to emphasize, however, our \r\ndismay at certain remarks in the statement delivered \r\nby the Syrian regime’s representative (see A/71/PV.20). \r\nIt included distorted facts and baseless accusations, \r\nincluding those regarding Turkey. We reject them \r\nin their entirety. We are confident that, eventually, \r\nthose responsible for the destruction of Syria and the \r\nsuffering of the Syrian people will be held accountable \r\nfor their crimes. Until then, Turkey will stand by the \r\ndemocratic aspirations of the Syrian people.\r\nMs. Rakhmatia (Indonesia): Indonesia would like \r\nto exercise its right of reply to the statements delivered \r\nby the representatives of the Solomon Islands (see A/71/\r\nPV.18) and Vanuatu (see A/71/PV.19), and the similar \r\nstatements by the representatives of Nauru (see A/71/\r\nPV.13), the Marshall Islands (see A/71/PV.15), Tuvalu \r\n(see A/71/PV.19) and Tonga (see A/71/PV.19), regarding \r\nmatters concerning Papua, a province of Indonesia.\r\nIndonesia is shocked to hear that, at this important \r\nstage, where leaders are gathered in the General \r\nAssembly to address the early implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, the transformation of \r\nour collective action, and other global challenges, such \r\nas climate change — whose severest impact is felt by \r\nPacific countries — the State leaders chose instead to \r\nviolate the Charter of the United Nations by interfering \r\nin another country’s sovereign affairs and attempting to \r\nviolate its territorial integrity.\r\nWe categorically reject the continuing insinuations \r\nin their statements, which clearly reflect an unfortunate \r\nlack of understanding of the history, current situation \r\nand progressive developments in Indonesia, including \r\nin the provinces of Papua and West Papua. Couched \r\nin unfriendly rhetoric and smacking of a political \r\nmanoeuver, those politically motivated statements \r\nwere designed to support separatist groups in the \r\nState provinces, groups that have persistently engaged \r\nin inciting public disorder and in conducting armed \r\nterrorist attacks on civilians and security personnel.\r\nThe statements made by those countries clearly \r\nviolate the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the principle of international \r\nlaw concerning friendly relations among States, as well \r\nas the sovereignty and territorial integrity of States. \r\nI reiterate that it is a violation of the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States. It is highly regrettable \r\nand dangerous for States to misuse the United Nations, \r\nincluding the Assembly. Those countries are using \r\nthe Assembly to advance their domestic agenda \r\nand, in some cases, in an attempt to divert attention \r\nfrom political and social problems at home. Those \r\ncountries mentioned are also using false and fabricated \r\ninformation as the basis for their statements. The \r\nconduct of those countries undermines the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and is detrimental to the credibility \r\nof the Assembly.\r\nIndonesia’s commitment to the protection of human \r\nrights is beyond question. Indonesia is a founding \r\nmember of the Human Rights Council. Indonesia has \r\nalready served as a member of the Council for three \r\nterms and is currently serving a fourth term. Indonesia \r\ninitiated the Intergovernmental Commission on Human \r\nRights of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and \r\nthe Independent Permanent Human Rights Commission \r\nof the Organization of Islamic Cooperation. Indonesia \r\nhas ratified eight out of nine core international human \r\nrights instruments, which have all been incorporated \r\ninto its national legal system — compared with just \r\nfour by the Solomon Islands and five by Vanuatu.\r\nIndonesia is among the few countries that have an \r\nongoing national plan of action on human rights; it is \r\ncurrently working with the fourth iteration of the plan, \r\nwhich is for the 2015-2019 period. Indonesia has had \r\nan active and robust National Commission on Human \r\nRights since 1993, as well as a vibrant civil society and \r\nfree media. Indonesia is a country with a full-f ledged, \r\nfunctioning democracy. In such a vibrant national \r\ndemocracy, where there is the highest commitment to \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights at all \r\nlevels, it would be nearly impossible for any human \r\nrights allegations to go unnoticed or unscrutinized.\r\nWe reaffirm that there are domestic mechanisms in \r\nplace at the national level in Indonesia, as well as at the \r\nprovincial level in Papua and West Papua. For our part, \r\nwe will continue to maintain appropriate focus on the \r\ndevelopment of the Papua and West Papua provinces in \r\nthe best interests of all.\r\nLet me conclude with a saying from our Asia-\r\nPacific region, namely, that when one points the index \r\nfinger at others, the thumb automatically points to one’s \r\nown face.\r\nMr. Li Yongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nWith respect to the arbitration unilaterally initiated by \r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n32/34 16-29817\r\nthe Philippines in the matter of the South China Sea \r\nand the ruling thereon, the Chinese Government and \r\nthe Ministry for Foreign Affairs have made statements \r\nand issued a position paper expressing the position of \r\nChina very clearly. I would like to reiterate here that the \r\nruling is null and void and has no binding force. China \r\nneither recognizes nor accepts it. China’s territorial \r\nsovereignty, maritime rights and interests in the South \r\nChina Sea shall under no circumstances be affected by \r\nthat ruling. China opposes and will never accept any \r\nclaim or action based on it.\r\nThe Chinese Government will continue to abide \r\nby international law and basic norms governing \r\ninternational relations as enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, including the principles of respecting \r\nState sovereignty, territorial integrity and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. To maintain peace and stability \r\nin the South China Sea, it will continue to work with \r\nthe States directly concerned to resolve the relevant \r\ndisputes in the South China Sea through negotiations \r\nand consultations, on the basis of respect for historical \r\nfacts and in accordance with international law.\r\nMr. Bailen (Philippines): I wish to thank the \r\nrepresentative of the People’s Republic of China for his \r\ndelegation’s interest and attention with regard to the \r\nstatement delivered earlier by the Secretary for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Philippines, Mr. Perfecto Yasay. In further \r\narticulating my country’s position. I will make a brief \r\nstatement and will not exhaust my full 10 minutes.\r\nWe know the position and arguments expressed by \r\nthe representative of China. As a fundamental point, \r\nmay I state that China’s position and arguments have \r\nbeen exhaustively discussed and addressed with finality \r\nin the award of the Arbitral Tribunal in the matter of \r\nthe South China Sea Arbitration, rendered on 12 July \r\n2016. The United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea, to which the Philippines and China are States \r\nparties, provides that the award shall be final and shall \r\nbe complied with by the parties. The Philippines, at the \r\nhighest level, has announced its readiness to engage \r\nChina in discussions to move forward on the resolution \r\nof the dispute. As a matter of fact, preliminary talks \r\nare now ongoing. At the same time, the Philippines, at \r\nthe highest level, has announced that the award of the \r\nArbitral Tribunal should be the starting point for the \r\nnegotiation of the resolution.\r\nTo reiterate, this award is now a significant part \r\nof the corpus of jurisprudence in international law, \r\nin particular the law of the sea. It cannot be ignored, \r\nnow or ever. It has clarified the maritime entitlements \r\nof both the Philippines and China with respect to the \r\nSouth China Sea, together with the respective rights \r\nand obligations in accordance with those entitlements.\r\nThe Arbitral Tribunal had jurisdiction over the \r\ndispute. On 29 October 2015, the Arbitral Tribunal issued \r\na unanimous award finding that it had jurisdiction, and \r\nthat that jurisdiction applies to China, even if it chose \r\nnot to participate in the proceedings. It also held that \r\nthe decision by the Philippines to commence arbitration \r\nunilaterally was not an abuse of the dispute settlement \r\nprovisions of the Convention. On 12 July 2016, the \r\nArbitral Tribunal rendered its award and the merits. I \r\nwill not take up the General Assembly’s precious time in \r\nsummarizing the award, for it should be well known to \r\nall Member States. Let me only mention the highlights.\r\nFirst, the Tribunal ruled that China’s claims to \r\nhistoric rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction, \r\nwith respect to the maritime areas of the South China \r\nSea encompassed by the relevant part of the “nine-dash \r\nline” are contrary to the Convention and without lawful \r\neffect to the extent that they exceed the geographic and \r\nsubstantive limits of China’s maritime entitlements \r\nunder the Convention. The Convention supersedes any \r\nhistoric rights, or other sovereign rights or jurisdiction, \r\nin excess of the limits imposed therein. The Convention \r\ndefines the scope of maritime entitlements in the South \r\nChina Sea, which may not extend beyond the limits \r\nimposed therein.\r\nSecond, the Tribunal ruled on the status, under \r\nthe Convention, of various maritime features in the \r\nSouth China Sea, ruling specifically that none of them \r\nis an island within the meaning of article 121 of the \r\nConvention. Not one of them — not Scarborough Shoal, \r\nwhich the Chinese call Huangyan Dao, Johnson Reef, \r\nCuarteron Reef, Fiery Cross Reef, Gaven Reef (North), \r\nMcKennan Reef, Mischief Reef nor Second Thomas \r\nShoal — can sustain human habitation or economic \r\nlife on their own and accordingly have no exclusive \r\neconomic zone or continental shelf.\r\nThird, the Tribunal found that Mischief Reef and \r\nSecond Thomas Shoal lie within 200 nautical miles of \r\nthe Philippines coast, off Palawan Island, and are located \r\nin an area that is not overlapped by the entitlements \r\ngenerated by any maritime feature claimed by China. \r\nMischief Reef and Second Thomas Shoal form part of \r\nthe exclusive economic zone and continental shelf of \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.21\r\n16-29817 33/34\r\nthe Philippines. According to the Tribunal, they are \r\nrocks — all of them.\r\nFourth, the Tribunal ruled that China, through \r\nthe construction of installations and artificial \r\nislands at Mischief Reef without the authorization \r\nof the Philippines, violated articles 60 and 80 of the \r\nConvention with respect to the Philippines’ sovereign \r\nrights in its exclusive economic zone and continental \r\nshelf, and that, as a low-tide elevation, Mischief Reef is \r\nnot capable of appropriation.\r\nFifth, the Tribunal ruled that China interfered \r\nwith the Philippines sovereign rights in its exclusive \r\neconomic zone and continental shelf through China’s \r\noperation of its marine surveillance vessels in 2011, \r\nin violation of article 77 of the Convention, with \r\nrespect to the Philippines’ sovereign rights over the \r\nnon-living resources of the continental shelf in the area \r\nof Reed Bank, and through China’s promulgation of \r\nthe moratorium in 2012 on fishing in the South China \r\nSea, without exception for areas of the South China \r\nSea falling within the exclusive economic zone of the \r\nPhilippines and without limiting the moratorium to \r\nChinese f lagged vessels, in violation of article 56 of the \r\nConvention, with respect to the Philippines’ sovereign \r\nrights over the living resources of its exclusive \r\neconomic zone.\r\nSixth, the Tribunal ruled that China, through the \r\noperation of its marine surveillance vessels, tolerated \r\nand failed to exercise due diligence to prevent fishing \r\nby Chinese f lagged vessels at Mischief Reef and Second \r\nThomas Shoal in 2013, and therefore failed to exhibit \r\ndue regard for the Philippines’ sovereign rights with \r\nrespect to fisheries in its exclusive economic zone, in \r\nviolation of article 58, paragraph 3, of the Convention.\r\nSeventh, the Tribunal ruled that China, through \r\nthe operation of its official vessels at Scarborough \r\nShoal from May 2012 onwards, unlawfully prevented \r\nFilipino fishermen from engaging in traditional fishing \r\nat Scarborough Shoal.\r\nEighth, the Tribunal ruled that China violated \r\nits obligation to protect and preserve the marine \r\nenvironment through its toleration and protection of, \r\nand failure to prevent, Chinese fishing vessels from \r\nengaging in harmful activities of harvesting endangered \r\nspecies at Scarborough Shoal, Second Thomas Shoal \r\nand other features in the Spratly Islands, in violation of \r\narticles 192 and 194, paragraph 5, of the Convention, and \r\nthrough its island-building activities at Cuarteron Reef, \r\nFiery Cross Reef, Gaven Reef (North), Johnson Reef, \r\nHughes Reef, Subi Reef and Mischief Reef, in violation \r\nof articles 192, 194, paragraph 1, 194, paragraph 5, 197, \r\n123 and 206 of the Convention.\r\nThe Tribunal found, based on compelling evidence, \r\nexpert reports and a critical assessment of Chinese \r\nclaims, that China’s artificial-island-building activities \r\non the seven reefs in the Spratly Islands have caused \r\ndevastating and long-lasting damage to the marine \r\nenvironment. The Tribunal also found that China did \r\nnot fulfil its duties under articles 205 and 206 of the \r\nConvention to cooperate or coordinate with the other \r\nStates bordering the South China Sea and to deliver an \r\nenvironmental impact assessment of the activities to a \r\ncompetent international body.\r\nNinth, the Tribunal ruled that China, by virtue of \r\nthe conduct of Chinese law enforcement vessels in the \r\nvicinity of Scarborough Shoal, created a serious risk \r\nof collision, endangered the Philippine vessels and \r\npersonnel, and thus violated article 94 of the Convention \r\nas well as rules 2, 6, 7, 8, 15 and 16 of the International \r\nRegulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972.\r\nTenth, the Tribunal ruled that China, in the course \r\nof the arbitration proceedings, aggravated and extended \r\nthe dispute between the parties through its dredging, \r\nartificial-island-building and construction activities in \r\nthe exclusive economic zone and the continental shelf \r\nof the Philippines.\r\nMr. Li Yongsheng (China): The unilateral initiation \r\nof an arbitration proceeding by the Philippine’s \r\nGovernment was done in bad faith. It aimed not to \r\nresolve the relevant disputes between China and \r\nthe Philippines or to maintain peace and stability in \r\nthe South China Sea, but to deny China’s territorial \r\nsovereignty, maritime rights and interests in the South \r\nChina Sea. The initiation of this arbitration proceeding \r\nviolates international law. The conduct of the Arbitral \r\nTribunal and its ruling seriously contravene the general \r\npractice of international arbitration; completely deviate \r\nfrom the object and purpose of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which \r\nis to promote the peaceful settlement of disputes; \r\nsubstantially impair the integrity and authority of \r\nUNCLOS; gravely infringe upon China’s legitimate \r\nright as a sovereign State and a State party to UNCLOS; \r\nand are unjust and unlawful.\r\nA/71/PV.21 24/09/2016\r\n34/34 16-29817\r\n(spoke in Chinese)\r\nAt the moment, thanks to the concerted efforts of \r\nChina and countries of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the situation in the South \r\nChina Sea is progressing in a positive direction. \r\nRegional countries have agreed to work to bring the \r\nSouth China Sea issue back on the right track of dialogue \r\nand consultation in a forward-looking spirit. China \r\nstands ready to work with ASEAN countries under \r\nregional arrangements, pursuant to the Declaration \r\non the Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea, to \r\nproperly handle disputes, enhance mutual trust, steer \r\nclear of disruptions and jointly maintain the peace and \r\nstability of the South China Sea.\r\nMr. Bailen (Philippines): In reply to the statement \r\nmade by the representative of China, may I just say \r\nthat the arbitration proceedings, which were initiated \r\nby the Philippines, were not the root cause of the \r\ndestabilization in the South China Sea. The root cause \r\nwas China’s unilateral and aggressive actions on the \r\nground that changed the status quo and imposed its \r\n“nine-dash line” on other countries and China’s island-\r\nbuilding and escalation of activities in the area. Those \r\ninclude the increased presence of military assets and \r\nthe possibility of the further militarization of outposts \r\nin the South China Sea, which have eroded trust and \r\nconfidence, increased tensions and undermined peace, \r\nsecurity and stability in the region. That is the core \r\nissue. It has been recognized in documents of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) at \r\nthe level of foreign ministers and ASEAN leaders. The \r\narbitration is the effort of the Philippines to resolve the \r\ndispute on an equal footing and under the rule of law.\r\nSecondly, the arbitration has not aggravated the \r\ndisputes in the South China Sea. Arbitration is widely \r\nrecognized as a peaceful means of solving disputes. \r\nAs the Arbitral Tribunal found, it had jurisdiction. \r\nThe ASEAN Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in \r\nthe South China Sea does not limit the Philippines to \r\nbilateral negotiations exclusively, especially if such \r\nbilateral negotiations prove to be unfair and one-sided. \r\nBut having said that, I reiterate that the Philippines is \r\nnow fully engaged and ready to talk with China on the \r\nbasis of the arbitral award.\r\nThirdly, the arbitration does not derail the work \r\nof ASEAN and China on a code of conduct. The joint \r\ncommuniqué cited earlier by the ASEAN leaders states \r\nthat ASEAN has urged all parties to ensure the full \r\nand effective implementation of the Declaration on \r\nthe Conduct of Parties in the South China Sea and the \r\nexpeditious conclusion of a code of conduct to build, \r\nmaintain and enhance mutual trust and confidence and \r\nto exercise self-restraint in the conduct of activities \r\nwith a view to creating a positive climate for the \r\neventual resolution of all contentious issues. The future \r\ncode of conduct can be concluded if all parties have \r\nthe political will and determination to make it happen. \r\nThe arbitration and the code-of-conduct consultations \r\nare moving on parallel tracks, and the Philippines is \r\ncommitted to both. The Philippines fully supports the \r\neffective role of its partners in ASEAN to pave the \r\nway forward.\r\nFinally, may I just say that the decisions handed \r\ndown by arbitral tribunals are binding, particularly \r\nas they relate to interpretations of international \r\nagreements and conventions, such as the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \r\nThe Arbitral Tribunal’s award states that the decision \r\nis final and binding on the parties. It provides a sound \r\nbasis for moving forward towards a new beginning: a \r\nrules-based regime in the South China Sea. We fully \r\nrespect the Tribunal’s award as an affirmation of \r\nUNCLOS. We believe in the fairness and thoroughness \r\nof the arbitral proceedings and its binding character, \r\nand in the need for all States parties and all members \r\nof the international community to respect this outcome. \r\nChina’s non-acceptance of the ruling will have grave \r\nconsequences for international law and for UNCLOS \r\nin particular. I believe that we would not want that \r\nto happen.\r\nDoes the Government of China say that there is no \r\ninternational law in accordance with UNCLOS?\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.45 p.m.\r\n"
