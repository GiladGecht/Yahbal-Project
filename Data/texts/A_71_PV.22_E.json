"United Nations A/71/PV.22\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n22nd plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 24 September 2016, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Ms. Young (Belize), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdallah, Minister \r\nResponsible for Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate \r\nof Oman.\r\nMr. Abdallah (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to begin my statement by congratulating the \r\nPresident and his country, the Republic of Fiji, on his \r\nelection to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session. I am confident that his wisdom \r\nand competence will enable him to steer the work of the \r\nAssembly to a successful conclusion. I would also like to \r\nassure him that my delegation stands ready to cooperate \r\nwith him in achieving our desired goals. Nor should I \r\nmiss this opportunity to express our appreciation to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of the Kingdom of \r\nDenmark, for his effectiveness in conducting the work \r\nof the Assembly at its seventieth session, which was key \r\nto ensuring that agreements were reached on several \r\ninternational issues.\r\nI would also like to put on record our appreciation \r\nfor Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s tireless efforts \r\nover the past 10 years to serve the shared interests of \r\nthe international community and bring the work of the \r\nOrganization and its organs up to the expectations of \r\nMember States.\r\nSince its establishment in 1945, the United Nations \r\nhas attained a position of esteem in international \r\nrelations. In that regard, we would like to express our \r\nappreciation to the Organization’s founding States, \r\nespecially the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil, for their efforts to maintain international \r\npeace and security despite the challenges they continue \r\nto face. They have made the Organization a safe haven \r\nin which States can settle their disputes and differences \r\nby peaceful means, based on the provisions of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law, \r\nwhich uphold the principles of mutual respect, good-\r\nneighbourliness, non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof States and peaceful coexistence.\r\nWe would be remiss if we failed to point out \r\nthat the world has seen many successes and positive \r\ndevelopments, politically, socially, economically, \r\nscientifically and technically, which today have made \r\nus closer and more interdependent than ever before. \r\nHowever, we are still dealing with many challenges and \r\ntragedies that humankind can never forget, challenges \r\nthat should motivate us all to work harder in support of \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nWe in the Sultanate of Oman continue to believe \r\nthat there is a solution for every problem as long as our \r\ninterests converge, the necessary political will is there \r\nand we act in a concerted way. That is because by their \r\nnature people are inclined to love peace, understanding \r\nand peaceful coexistence, which serve the interests \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

My \r\ncountry is therefore among the States that have adopted \r\na policy of dialogue, negotiation and conciliation in \r\norder to settle disputes by peaceful means, based on \r\nthe provisions of Chapter VI of the Charter and on the \r\nstandards and traditions of our human heritage. Thanks \r\nto the peaceful diplomatic approach of His Majesty \r\nSultan Qaboos Bin Said of Oman, we have succeeded \r\nin establishing friendly relations and cooperation with \r\ncountries all over the world that we are keen to maintain \r\nand develop in every area for the interests and for the \r\ngood of the Sultanate and other countries.\r\nWe should also take this opportunity to emphasize \r\nthe centrality of the Palestinian question for stability in \r\nthe Middle East. If we cannot reach a comprehensive \r\nand just solution to the issue, it is difficult to imagine \r\nthe possibility of establishing normal relations between \r\nthe States and peoples of the region in a way that \r\ncan foster mutual trust and coexistence. Despite the \r\nefforts of the international community and the various \r\ninitiatives to help the Palestinians and the Israelis to \r\nreach an agreement on a road map that would look after \r\nthe interest of both parties, all efforts failed to achieve \r\nthe desired outcome. Therefore, we would like to renew \r\nour call to the international community to intensify \r\nefforts through a new perspective that would enable the \r\nconcerned parties to reach a comprehensive and just \r\nsettlement that would end the long conflict.\r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation to \r\nthe United Nations and to the Special Envoys of the \r\nSecretary-General for their efforts to reach peaceful \r\nsettlements to crises in a number of States in the Middle \r\nEast, especially the Syrian Arab Republic, the Republic \r\nof Yemen and Libya. However, we should note that the \r\nsituations in those States have suffered serious setbacks, \r\nwhich threaten international peace and security.\r\nWe believe in the importance of adhering to the \r\nprinciple of dialogue in order to resolve disputes by \r\npeaceful means. Since the onset of the crises in the \r\nthree aforementioned States, the Sultanate of Oman \r\nhas sought to reconcile points of view with the parties \r\nconcerned and to encourage them to reject differences \r\nand resume negotiation. The Sultanate has hosted \r\nseveral meetings towards that end, in coordination \r\nwith the United Nations. In that respect, we cannot \r\nfail to pay tribute to the laudable efforts of the State of \r\nKuwait for hosting the Yemen peace negotiations. We \r\nlaud, in particular, the efforts exerted by His Highness \r\nAmir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah to \r\nbridge the gap in the views of Yemeni parties. The goal \r\nhas been to achieve a win-win solution to the conflict \r\nthrough peaceful negotiations.\r\nIn closing, we must emphasize the need for the spirit \r\nof joint international action, which makes it incumbent \r\nupon all of us to rid ourselves of the negative aspects \r\nof the past and concentrate on the positive elements \r\nof the future. Our goal should be to develop relations, \r\nenhance cooperation, deepen interests between States \r\nand peoples, and settle differences through dialogue \r\nthat is based on the principles and provisions of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international legal \r\nprinciples. By doing so, the United Nations will remain \r\nthe beacon of peace for all States.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nShaikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I am pleased to extend to Mr. Thomson, and \r\nthrough him to the friendly country of Fiji, my sincere \r\ncongratulations on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish \r\nhim sustained success in the discharge of the noble \r\ntasks with which he has been entrusted. I also wish to \r\nexpress our appreciation to His Excellency Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft for his outstanding contribution and his \r\nefficient and highly professional management of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly at the seventieth session.\r\nWe commend the extraordinary efforts exerted by \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon during his two terms \r\nwith a view to achieving the goals of the international \r\nOrganization in establishing the foundations of peace \r\nand security in the world. We share the hope he expressed \r\nin his statement at the beginning of the general debate \r\n(see A/71/PV.8) that the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange will enter into force by the end of this year. \r\nWe also endorse his proposal for the establishment of \r\na high-level panel to find practical solutions that will \r\nimprove decision-making mechanisms at the United \r\nNations. We support the continued pursuit of the great \r\nachievements that took place in all domains, notably \r\nin the fields of education and health, during the past \r\ndecade. I seize this opportunity to express to the \r\nSecretary-General our thanks and appreciation for all \r\nthat he has accomplished at the helm of the Organization \r\nand to wish him every success in his future endeavours \r\nin the service of his own country and the world at large.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 3/53\r\nThe theme of this general debate, “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform \r\nour world”, testifies to our collective will and earnest \r\ndesire to achieve those Goals. Under the leadership \r\nof His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa, my \r\ncountry attaches great importance to the Goals and has \r\nalready started to implement them, as is documented \r\nin international reports. My country will persevere in \r\nits commitment, consistent with its ambitious national \r\nplans and programmes, fully convinced that the \r\nachievement of the Goals promises a bright future for \r\nits citizens.\r\nA few days ago, the United Nations held an important \r\ndemonstration of its relationship with the Kingdom of \r\nBahrain, namely, the Sustainable Development Award \r\nceremony hosted by Bahrain on 23 September on the \r\nmargins of the General Assembly. There, His Royal \r\nHighness Prince Khalifa bin Salman Al Khalifa’s \r\nSustainable Development Award was presented to \r\nProfessor Anna Tibaijuka, former Executive Director \r\nof the United Nations Human Settlements Programme \r\n(UN-Habitat), a deserving laureate. The presentation \r\nunderlines the Kingdom’s vision of sustainable \r\ndevelopment as a value that it not only seeks to achieve \r\nbut also one that it seeks to promote by supporting all \r\nendeavours aimed at realizing it throughout the world.\r\nThe achievements of Bahraini women at the \r\ninternational level — notably by being elected to \r\nmembership of the Commission on the Status of \r\nWomen and the Executive Board of UN-Women and \r\nthe fact that Bahrain received first place internationally \r\nfor the highest growth rate of women’s participation in \r\neconomic activities, as documented in a report of the \r\nInternational Labour Organization this year — testify \r\nto the close cooperation between the Kingdom of \r\nBahrain and the United Nations and the keen interest \r\nof my country, represented by the Supreme Council for \r\nWomen under the leadership of Her Royal Highness \r\nPrincess Sabika Bint Ibrahim Al-Khalifa, in enhancing \r\nthe empowerment of Bahraini women nationally and \r\ninternationally and accelerating their participation in \r\nall Government and community sectors as a principal \r\ncomponent that has contributed, and will continue to \r\ncontribute, to the process of community development \r\nand progress.\r\n“Development that does not have the citizen as \r\nits target is futile and undesirable”. Those were the \r\nwords of His Majesty the King at the launch of the \r\nBahrain Economic Vision 2030, clearly affirming that \r\nthe well-being, happiness and stability of our citizens \r\nare the main pillars of development in all fields and \r\nthat the Government’s efforts to achieve the global \r\ndevelopment goals are in parallel with its national \r\neconomic vision. The Government’s action plan and \r\nits United Nations Development Programme country \r\nprogramme document both stress that Bahrain will \r\ncontinue to guarantee to all citizens, men and women \r\nalike, the enjoyment of all their constitutional rights. \r\nWe shall steadfastly pursue our approach to progress, \r\nprosperity and advancement, despite all political and \r\neconomic challenges and any attempt to divert us from \r\nour national task.\r\nDevelopment goes hand in hand with the security \r\nand stability of the individual citizen and of society \r\nat large. Neither can be achieved in isolation from the \r\nother, without a stable and secure State, with good \r\ngovernance and solid and effective institutions. Such \r\nis the road map that should be followed in all States \r\ngenerally and in the Middle East in particular, where \r\nthe enormous challenges have been considered grave \r\nthreats to international peace and security. It is for that \r\nreason that protection of the foundations of the nation \r\nState in our own countries and preventing their collapse \r\nin other countries is the basis for sustaining security, \r\ndevelopment and prosperity. It deserves to become \r\nthe major objective of all actors and groupings of the \r\ninternational community, without double standards \r\nor hidden agendas. When united regionally and \r\ninternationally, we are capable of addressing all those \r\nchallenges, particularly terrorism.\r\nWe should jointly commit ourselves, without \r\nhesitation and in full determination, to eradicating \r\nall the underlying causes of terrorism, cutting off the \r\nsources of financing to terrorists and resolutely and \r\nvigorously protecting our societies from the discourse \r\nof hate and extremism. In that regard, we assert that \r\nanti-terrorism measures will not be effective through \r\nlegislation and laws that contravene the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the principles of international law. \r\nThe approach taken by the United States Congress in \r\npassing the Justice against the Sponsors of Terrorism \r\nAct jeopardizes international relations based on the \r\nprinciple of the equal sovereignty of States and their \r\nsovereign immunity. It constitutes a dangerous precedent \r\nin relations between nations and threatens the stability \r\nof the international system, which in turn adversely \r\naffects international efforts to combat terrorism.\r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n4/53 16-29823\r\nThe question of displaced persons and refugees \r\nis among the serious issues generated by the situation \r\nprevailing in some countries in our region. It is \r\nnegatively impacting development efforts and, if not \r\nresolved, will lead to more instability not just in the \r\nregion, but throughout the world. The Syrian crisis, \r\nin all its phases and developments, constitutes the \r\ngreatest human tragedy of our contemporary world. In \r\na country that just a few years ago welcomed thousands \r\nof refugees, the Syrian population today is unable to \r\nlive in peace and security on its own land. More than \r\nhalf of the Syrian people live as refugees or internally \r\ndisplaced persons, while the situation deteriorates day \r\nafter day, creating a vacuum exploited by terrorist \r\norganizations to consolidate their position and threaten \r\nthe entire region. We must, as an ethical and human \r\nimperative, address those threats, and the international \r\ncommunity must act in unison to confront the problem \r\nfrom all angles.\r\nWe appreciate the efforts of the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia, the State of Kuwait, the Hashemite Kingdom \r\nof Jordan, the Lebanese Republic and the Republic \r\nof Turkey to mitigate the humanitarian predicament \r\nof Syrians. We invite the international community \r\nto aid the efforts of our countries. We commend the \r\nUnited Nations for its efforts in that respect, which \r\nrecently culminated in the high-level plenary meeting \r\non addressing large movements of refugees and \r\nmigrants and the adoption of the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1, annex). \r\nFollow-up actions to implement the provisions of the \r\nDeclaration will undoubtedly have a positive impact.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has consistently supported \r\nthe aspirations of the Syrian people to build, in accord \r\nwith their own will, a civil State with a national fabric \r\nrich in cultural and human heritage and diverse in \r\nits various components, with a view to restoring the \r\nspirit of love and tolerance. We call on all States with \r\nleverage in the Syrian crisis, notably the United States \r\nand the Russian Federation, to join efforts to achieve \r\na political solution to the crisis along the lines of the \r\nGeneva communiqué and Security Council resolution \r\n2254 (2015). Furthermore, it is imperative to implement \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2165 (2014), which \r\nstipulates the direct, unfettered and immediate delivery \r\nof humanitarian assistance to the entire Syrian territory, \r\nthereby saving that beloved country and its people \r\nfrom a tragedy we all want to see ended, avoiding the \r\ncollapse of the remaining State institutions, preserving \r\nSyria’s territorial integrity, eradicating all terrorist \r\norganizations at large in the country and putting an end \r\nto the regional meddling, whether direct or by proxy, \r\nthat hinders the peaceful settlement of the crisis.\r\nIn the same vein, we encourage all efforts in Iraq \r\nto overcome the problems facing the reconstruction of \r\nthe State and its institutions and the fulfilment of the \r\nwill of the Iraqi people through the participation of all \r\npolitical factions, without external pressure. We stress \r\nthe need for perseverance in the efforts to re-establish \r\nState authority over the entire national territory by \r\nousting the terrorist organizations and to combat the \r\ncriminal and inhumane practices of extremist militias \r\nagainst Iraqis and their neighbours under the pretext of \r\nfighting terrorism.\r\nWe look forward to the day when we shall see \r\nan independent Palestinian State, living in peace and \r\nsecurity, side by side with the State of Israel. I have \r\nno doubt whatsoever that the people of the region, \r\nboth Arabs and Israelis, are eager to see this day and \r\nlook forward to a just and comprehensive peace. That \r\nhope remains contingent on Israel’s admission that its \r\nsecurity and stability cannot be ensured unless the \r\nsame holds true for the Palestinian people. Israel needs \r\nto be serious about achieving a just and durable peace in \r\nthe region, with Palestinians and Israelis alike feeling \r\nthat they are safe and that their future and the future of \r\ntheir children are also safe. An end must be put to the \r\npractices that hinder the long-awaited peace, notably the \r\nviolations against the sanctity of Al-Aqsa mosque that \r\noffend the feelings of Muslims all over the world. All \r\nillegal settlements in the occupied Palestinian territory \r\nshould be dismantled. Recognition must be given to \r\nthe right of the Palestinian people to an independent \r\nState, within the 4 June 1967 boundaries, with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, consistent with international \r\nlaw and instruments and the relevant resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations. Israel should respond positively and \r\nin an open spirit to the Arab Peace Initiative, which \r\nis still valid and on the table. We continue to embrace \r\nthe Initiative and shall not back down, as it offers the \r\ncorrect and appropriate approach to laying down the \r\nfoundation of peace in the region and to promoting \r\ncooperation among its nations and States.\r\nWith respect to the situation in the Republic of \r\nYemen, the commitment of the Kingdom of Bahrain, \r\na member of the Arab coalition to restore legitimacy \r\nin Yemen, will remain steadfast. Bahrain has spared \r\nno resources or blood to achieve this noble goal, and \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 5/53\r\nwe shall continue on that path, no matter how great \r\nthe sacrifices, until the time when the legitimate \r\nGovernment under the leadership of His Excellency \r\nPresident Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour is in a \r\nposition to take control of the entire territory of Yemen.\r\nWe underline the humanitarian role played by the \r\ncoalition forces and their determination not to target \r\ncivilians. We demand that the coup d’état forces and \r\ntheir supporters, whose ambition is to take control of the \r\ninstitutions of the State, immediately cease committing \r\nany negative actions that hinder stability. We do not \r\nstand against any Yemeni party, but we do stand by \r\nYemen and the Yemeni people in their fight against all \r\nwho try to harm Yemen or control it from outside. We \r\nwill continue this support until a political settlement is \r\nreached and a peaceful solution that puts an end to the \r\nsuffering of the Yemeni people is implemented.\r\nSuch a solution must safeguard the security, \r\nstability and unity of the Yemeni people in accordance \r\nwith international terms of reference, notably the \r\nGulf Cooperation Council (GCC) initiative and its \r\nimplementation mechanism, the outcome of the \r\nNational Dialogue Conference and resolution 2216 \r\n(2015). We commend the efforts exerted by Mr. Ismail \r\nOuld Cheikh Ahmed, the Secretary-General’s Special \r\nEnvoy for Yemen, and by the State of Kuwait to help \r\nfind a settlement to the crisis.\r\nWith respect to Libya, that brotherly Arab country \r\nbadly needs all parties to show solidarity, work together \r\nto get through the present difficult stage and overcome \r\nthe challenges that the country faces. Those challenges \r\nare obstructing the people’s aspirations to live in peace \r\nand enjoy the stability of a unified State with robust \r\nmodern institutions. We welcome the formation of the \r\nGovernment of National Accord and stress the need to \r\nprovide it with the necessary support in order for the \r\nLibyan House of Representatives to build the necessary \r\nconfidence that will enable it to lead the country, \r\ndischarge its duties and responsibilities and rid the \r\ncountry of terrorist organizations by eradicating them.\r\nWith respect to the issue of the Western Sahara, \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain underlines the need to find \r\na political settlement on the basis of the Moroccan \r\ninitiative for self-government and the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions, so that the territorial integrity of \r\nMorocco may be guaranteed and that the security and \r\nstability in the region may be enhanced. We welcome \r\nthe return of Morocco to the African Union and the \r\nresumption of its vital role on the continent.\r\nWith regard to the Islamic Republic of Iran, we in \r\nthe GCC and all Arab countries have spared no effort to \r\nbuild the best relations possible with that neighbouring \r\ncountry on the basis of good-neighbourliness and \r\nrespect for the sovereignty of States, consistent with \r\nthe practices and principles of international relations \r\nbetween States. We have not hesitated for an instant \r\nto build bridges and seek to improve relations with it. \r\nHowever, despite all these efforts and sincere wishes, \r\nthere has never been a serious response from Iran. The \r\nefforts we undertook ended either in an impasse or with \r\na creation of new problems and crises that obligated us \r\nto return to square one.\r\nWe still hear the same irresponsible sectarian \r\ndiscourse from Iran and have witnessed the damage \r\ndone to our bilateral and multilateral relations. In \r\nthe most recent incident, Iranian officials made false \r\nallegations against the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \r\nwhich is a country that plays a laudable role in \r\nefficiently providing hospitality, safety, protection and \r\ncare for large numbers of pilgrims during the seasons \r\nof Hajj and Umrah. No one can deny or minimize the \r\nimportance of those efforts.\r\nWe continue to face Iran’s attempts to jeopardize \r\nour security and social peace through the support it \r\nprovides to groups and militias under its authority, \r\nsuch as the terrorists of Hizbullah and the Iranian \r\nRevolutionary Guard Corps. Iran also continues to \r\noccupy three Emirati islands in the Arabian Gulf and \r\nrefuses mediation for a peaceful settlement.\r\nThe situation is clear, and there is no way that it \r\nwill change if Iran does not undertake a comprehensive \r\nchange in its foreign policies, put an end to its hostile \r\npolicies and show an open attitude towards our \r\ncountries. Doing those things would undoubtedly pave \r\nthe way for the region to enter a new era of stability \r\nand development.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the need to join \r\nefforts aimed at establishing a zone free of weapons \r\nof mass destruction, notably nuclear weapons, in the \r\nMiddle East, including the Arabian Gulf region, while \r\nstressing the right of countries to use nuclear power \r\nfor peaceful purposes. Nuclear power was created \r\nonly to serve human beings and to improve their \r\nlives, not to harm them or be used as lethal weapons \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n6/53 16-29823\r\nthat might obliterate entire cities and kill millions of \r\ninnocent people.\r\nWe have before us an opportunity to overcome \r\nthe challenges facing us and maintain the strength and \r\ncohesion of our nations and peoples. We belong to a \r\nregion that has made tremendous human contributions \r\nand great civilizational achievements. Our region \r\nhas contributed effectively to all that we witness and \r\nlive out today by way of the human progress we have \r\ncontributed to in various fields of endeavour, including \r\nthe sciences. All of that was possible only because \r\nthose who lived in the region did so in an atmosphere of \r\nfull security and harmony, without divisions based on \r\nethnic, ideological or religious differences. We should \r\nremember that fact as we work to build the future we \r\nseek for our countries and future generations with \r\na view to making important contributions to human \r\ncivilization that we can be proud of.\r\nI would repeat here a few words by His Majesty \r\nKing Hamad bin Isa Al Khalifa:\r\n“The Kingdom of Bahrain and its people \r\nepitomize the principles of friendship, tolerance, \r\nmutual respect and openness to the world. We are \r\nproud of our diversity and our solid belief that \r\nevery individual has the right to enjoy a safe and \r\ndecent life.”\r\nThose words, characteristic of the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nand its citizens, clearly reflect the spirit of the region \r\nand the aspirations of its people.\r\nI would like to conclude by saying that the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain, with its leadership and enlightened people \r\neager to embrace the love and peace of the world \r\nand all its peoples, will remain faithful to the lofty \r\nhuman values and principles on which we have prided \r\nourselves since time immemorial. As we confront the \r\nchallenges to the Kingdom’s safety and achievements, \r\nwe shall hold fast to these values, while remembering \r\nthat they illuminate our path towards a safe and stable \r\nsociety in which everyone enjoys security, prosperity \r\nand progress.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Sushma Swaraj, Minister for External Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of India.\r\nMs. Swaraj (India) (spoke in Hindi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): On behalf \r\nof India and on my own behalf, I congratulate Mr. Peter \r\nThomson on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. I would also like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his service to the United Nations, the \r\nlargest peace movement in history.\r\nA year has passed since I stood here at this hallowed \r\nrostrum to address the members of the international \r\ncommunity (see A/70/PV.22). Since then, many things \r\nhave changed in the world around us — some for the \r\nbetter, some for the worse, and many that have been a \r\ncause for great concern. There can be no better platform \r\nto ponder our actions and our achievements over the \r\npast year. We must remember that we will be defined \r\nnot just by our actions but, equally, by our inaction.\r\nA number of issues have been debated in the General \r\nAssembly, from the necessity of global partnerships in \r\nsharing new vaccines and promoting access to affordable \r\ndrugs to counter antimicrobial resistance to the need \r\nfor faster implementation of the Sendai Framework for \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030, from the challenges \r\nof ensuring well-ordered mobility of productive human \r\nresources to the necessity of adequate consultations \r\nwith troop-contributing countries before framing \r\nmandates for United Nations peacekeeping operations. \r\nHowever, since my time is limited, I would therefore \r\nfocus on only some of the most pressing issues facing \r\nthe international community.\r\nThe true challenges of our time are to end the \r\ncurse of harsh poverty, which still lurks in so many \r\ncorners of our world, to ensure that the fruits of \r\ngrowing prosperity reach those who need it most, to \r\ntake forward the mission of gender equality and protect \r\nwomen where progress on gender issues has lapsed, and \r\nto ensure peace across borders, not least because there \r\ncan be no prosperity without peace.\r\nI congratulate the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor giving priority to the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) by making them central to the theme of \r\nthe seventy-first session of the General Assembly. I am \r\nhappy that the 17 Goals adopted by the Assembly are \r\nin line with the development vision of my Government, \r\nwhich has been geared in recent years towards the \r\nachievement of these very objectives.\r\nUnder the Swachh Bharat Abhiyan campaign — the \r\nClean India mission — more than 400,000 toilets have \r\nbeen constructed in over 200,000 schools. Similarly, in \r\nterms of gender equality, the Beti Bachao Beti Padhao \r\ncampaign — Educate the Girl Child, Save the Girl Child \r\nprogramme — has become a nationwide movement led \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 7/53\r\nby women. The Make in India initiative is receiving \r\ninternational acclaim. Under the Pradhan Mantri Jan-\r\nDhan Yojana initiative, the largest financial inclusion \r\nprogramme the world has ever seen, nearly 250 million \r\nbank accounts have been opened for the poor. Digital \r\nIndia is transforming the country. Under the Skill \r\nIndia Initiative, a number of programmes have been \r\nundertaken to enable young people to take advantage \r\nof the demographic dividend. Those initiatives have \r\nadded a new dimension to India’s growth story, making \r\nit the fastest-growing major economy in the world at a \r\ntime of slow global growth.\r\nWe are all aware that one sixth of humankind lives \r\nin India. Accordingly, global success in realizing the \r\nSDGs depends on the success achieved in India. We \r\nare committed to the wholehearted implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development as a \r\nnational effort. We have decided to dedicate one day in \r\neach session of our Parliament to discussions relating \r\nsolely to the SDGs, which will enable us to consistently \r\nmonitor the progress made on them and give us good \r\nresults. However, for the successful implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nin a globalized world, national efforts need to be \r\nsupplemented by international cooperation.\r\nClimate change is yet another serious challenge we \r\nare having to confront. There are enough resources on \r\nthis planet to fulfil everyone’s needs, but not enough \r\nto satisfy anyone’s greed, for greed is limitless. In that \r\ncontext, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has championed \r\na new concept, namely, climate justice. If we respect \r\nnature, nature will respect and nurture us and future \r\ngenerations. However, if we exploit nature mindlessly \r\nthen we must be mindful that nature will unleash its \r\nfury upon us. In different parts of the world, we have \r\nalready seen nature drift towards the unnatural — from \r\ntorrential rains to excessive heat, from tsunamis to \r\nstorms and cloudbursts.\r\nWe must curb reckless consumption and adopt \r\nlifestyles in harmony with nature. Yoga, the storehouse \r\nof India’s ancient wisdom, epitomizes a sustainable \r\nlifestyle. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our gratitude for the unprecedented global \r\nresponse to the International Day of Yoga, which has \r\nbeen celebrated for the past two years.\r\nIn the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities \r\nand respective capabilities has been acknowledged \r\nand accepted. That makes it clear that, while our \r\nresponsibility is common, our obligations are different. \r\nDeveloped nations must discharge their responsibility \r\nin the search for the common good through finance and \r\ntechnology transfer.\r\nIndia has launched an ambitious domestic effort to \r\ntransform our energy mix and attain 40 per cent energy \r\nfrom non-fossil fuel sources by 2030. The massive \r\ninvestments required entail a predictable and stable \r\nenvironment, towards which we are actively working. \r\nAdditionally, our ground-breaking initiative for an \r\nInternational Solar Energy Alliance is intended to make \r\nefficient solar technology available for all.\r\nI assure the General Assembly that India will \r\ncontinue to play a leading role in combating climate \r\nchange. We have carefully chosen the date to submit \r\nour instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, which will be 2 October, the \r\nanniversary of the birth of Mahatma Gandhi, who \r\nepitomized a lifestyle with the smallest possible \r\ncarbon footprint.\r\nLet me now turn to a subject of critical importance, \r\nand which deeply concerns every member of the \r\nAssembly. This month we marked the fifteenth \r\nanniversary of the 11 September 2001 terrorist attack \r\non this city. Tragically, less than 15 days ago, another \r\nattempt at killing innocents was made in an act of \r\nterror on this same city. We, who have suffered in \r\nUri, Kashmir, recently, understand the pain inflicted \r\nby the same forces. The world has been battling this \r\nscourge for a very long time. However, despite the \r\nblood and tears of innocent victims, attacks this year \r\nalone in Kabul, Dhaka, Istanbul, Mogadishu, Brussels, \r\nBangkok, Paris, Pathankot and Uri, as well as the daily \r\nbarbaric tragedies in Syria and Iraq, remind us that \r\nthese malevolent forces have yet to be defeated.\r\nWe must acknowledge that terrorism is undoubtedly \r\nthe greatest of all violations of human rights. We must \r\naccept this fact as a first principle. Terrorism targets \r\nthe innocent and kills indiscriminately. Having gone \r\nfar beyond affecting individuals or nations, it is a crime \r\nagainst humanity itself. But it is important to ask: who \r\nis behind this and who benefits from it? Terrorists do \r\nnot own banks or weapons factories, so let us ask the \r\nquestion of who finances these terrorists, who arms them \r\nand who provides them sanctuary. Similar questions \r\nwere asked by the Vice-President of Afghanistan from \r\nthis rostrum a few days ago (see A/71/PV.11).\r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n8/53 16-29823\r\nHistory proves that those who plant the seeds of \r\nextremist ideology reap a bitter harvest. The contagion \r\nof evil seen in small terrorist groups has grown into \r\na hydra-headed monster backed by technological \r\nsophistication that threatens the peace and harmony \r\nof our world. We will not be able to win the fight \r\nagainst terrorism by making specious distinctions \r\nbetween the problems of one group and the problems of \r\nothers — between terrorists who attack some and those \r\nwho attack others. We do not know who will be the next \r\nvictim of Frankenstein’s monster.\r\nIf we want to defeat terrorism, therefore, there is \r\nonly one way, that is, to unite despite our differences, \r\nadd steel to our resolve and inject urgency into our \r\nresponse. We need to forget our prejudices and join \r\nhands to draw up an effective strategy against terror. \r\nThat is not an impossible task, provided that we have \r\nthe will. We can do it, and we must do it; otherwise, \r\nfuture generations will forever hold us to account. And \r\nif any nation refuses to join the global strategy, then we \r\nmust isolate it. That is my simple demand.\r\nThere are nations in our midst that still speak the \r\nlanguage of terrorism. They nurture it, peddle it and \r\nexport it. Sheltering terrorists has become the calling \r\ncard of such nations. We must identify those nations \r\nand hold them to account. The nations in which United \r\nNations-designated terrorists roam freely and which \r\nlead demonstrations and deliver their poisonous \r\nsermons of hate with impunity are as culpable as the \r\nvery terrorists whom they harbour. There should be no \r\nplace for such countries in the community of nations.\r\nOn 21 September, the Prime Minister of Pakistan \r\nused this rostrum to make baseless allegations about \r\nhuman rights violations in my country (see A/71/\r\nPV.11). I can say only that those accusing others of \r\nhuman rights violations would do well to look within \r\nand see what egregious abuses they are perpetrating \r\nin their own countries, including in Baluchistan. The \r\nbrutality against the Baluch people represents the worst \r\nform of State oppression.\r\nThe Prime Minister of Pakistan also said that India \r\nhad come up with preconditions for talks that he found \r\nunacceptable. What preconditions was he talking about? \r\nDid we impose any preconditions before extending an \r\ninvitation to him to attend our Government’s oath-\r\ntaking ceremony? Did we impose any preconditions \r\nwhen I went to Islamabad for the Heart of Asia-Istanbul \r\nProcess and agreed to commence the comprehensive \r\nbilateral dialogue with Pakistan? Did we impose any \r\npreconditions when Prime Minister Modi travelled \r\nfrom Kabul to Lahore? What preconditions? What are \r\nwe talking about?\r\nWe took the initiative to resolve issues not on the \r\nbasis of conditions, but on the basis of friendship. That \r\nis the truth. We have in fact attempted to establish an \r\nunprecedented paradigm of friendship in the past two \r\nyears. We conveyed Eid greetings to the Prime Minister \r\nof Pakistan, wished success to his cricket team and \r\nextended good wishes for his health and well-being. \r\nDid any of that come with preconditions attached?\r\nAnd what did we get in return? Pathankot, Bahadur \r\nAli and Uri? Are we imposing preconditions or are the \r\nPakistanis now going in a different direction? Bahadur \r\nAli is a terrorist in our custody whose confession is \r\nproof of Pakistan’s complicity in cross-border terror. \r\nBut when confronted with such evidence, Pakistan \r\ncontinues to deny it. Pakistan persists in the belief that \r\nsuch attacks will enable it to acquire the territory it \r\ncovets. My firm advice to Pakistan is to abandon that \r\ndream. Let me state unequivocally that Jammu and \r\nKashmir is an integral part of India and will always \r\nremain so. That is why Pakistan should abandon \r\nthat dream.\r\nAs I said at the outset, we will be judged by both \r\nour action and our inaction. What goals have we \r\nachieved and what objectives remain unfulfilled? The \r\nfirst pending task for the Assembly is the adoption \r\nof the comprehensive convention on international \r\nterrorism, which was proposed by India in 1996. In \r\n2016, despite the fact that two decades have elapsed, \r\nwe have yet to conclude an agreement. As a result, we \r\nare unable to develop a standard under which terrorists \r\nshall be prosecuted or extradited. I therefore appeal to \r\nthe General Assembly that it act with fresh resolve and \r\nurgency to adopt that critical convention.\r\nThe second pending task is Security Council \r\nreform. Just as we need a more contemporary approach \r\nto combating terrorism, we also need a less outdated \r\nSecurity Council, which currently reflects the world \r\norder of a bygone era. The vast majority of nations share \r\nthe belief that the United Nations should not remain \r\nfrozen in 1945, which serves only the interests of a \r\nfew. Whether it is a question of institutions or issues, \r\nwe must come to terms with present-day realities and \r\nthe challenges we have before us. An expansion in the \r\npermanent and non-permanent Council categories of \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 9/53\r\nmembership in order to reflect contemporary realities \r\nis therefore an urgent necessity. We must move \r\nforward substantively through the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations towards a text-based negotiation.\r\nIf both of the long-pending issues that I mentioned \r\nare addressed during the presidency of Mr. Thomson, \r\nthen the success of the seventy-first session will \r\nbe assured.\r\nThe twenty-first century has begun in the shadow \r\nof turmoil, but we can turn it into a golden age in the \r\nhistory of civilization through united and concerted \r\nefforts. But we must remember that what happens \r\ntomorrow will depend on what we do today.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Singapore.\r\nMr. Balakrishnan (Singapore): It is a special \r\nhonour for me to address the General Assembly on \r\nbehalf of Singapore, a tiny island city-State that is \r\nsometimes referred to as a tiny red dot.\r\nThe United Nations is essential for our survival \r\nand prosperity, as it is in particular for all small States. \r\nWe are usually on the receiving end of the decisions \r\nand actions of large Powers. Fortunately, the General \r\nAssembly affirms the principle that all nations, large \r\nor small, rich or poor, have an equal stake and an \r\nequal right to participate in shaping the discourse on \r\nglobal issues.\r\nThe year 2016 has been a year of increased \r\nuncertainty and volatility. We have seen sluggish \r\ngrowth and poor job creation in the major economies, \r\nwhich have been accompanied by growing xenophobia \r\nand disillusionment with mainstream politics. We \r\nhave witnessed rising nationalism, populism and \r\nprotectionism, which have clouded the political \r\ndiscourse and confounded electoral outcomes \r\neverywhere. The conflicts in Syria, Yemen and Libya \r\ncontinue unabated, with serious repercussions beyond \r\nthe region, including causing unprecedented f lows \r\nof refugees. Terrorism remains a clear and present \r\nthreat to international peace and security, which has \r\nbeen amplified by social media, and has been used \r\nso skilfully by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS) and other terrorist groups to spread radical ideas \r\nand promote violent extremism.\r\nSouth-East Asia, the region where I come from, \r\nhas also become a fertile recruiting ground for ISIS. \r\nIn fact, we know that more than 1,000 men and \r\nwomen, including some Singaporeans, have gone to \r\nthe Middle East to fight for ISIS. Those people have \r\nbeen indoctrinated with extremist ideology, trained \r\nwith combat skills and killed people — and everyone \r\nknows that it is always easier to kill the second time \r\naround. They will further pose a significant risk as they \r\nseek to promote violence at home, overthrow legitimate \r\nGovernments and establish a caliphate in South-East \r\nAsia. Singapore is committed to working with its friends \r\nand partners to address the threat of violent extremism \r\nand terrorism by exchanging intelligence and sharing \r\nour own experience with deradicalization programmes.\r\nWhile that is taking place, we also recall the \r\nEbola virus epidemic in 2014 and the current zika \r\ninfections. They are stark reminders that global health \r\nremains a concern. We all need to work with the World \r\nHealth Organization to keep our countries safe, while \r\nremaining open, connected and functioning.\r\nIn an uncertain world, small States like Singapore \r\nwill have to work that much harder just to stay afloat. \r\nSmall boats on a rough sea are much more likely to be \r\ntossed and overturned than a large tanker with heavy \r\nballast. For our survival and our prosperity, small States \r\nhave to stay open and connected to the world. But, by \r\ndefinition, our very openness makes us vulnerable to \r\nexternal shocks and threats. Small States like ours do \r\nnot have the option of retreating inwards or opting out \r\nof the global system.\r\nIt is a reality that the world will become more \r\nand more interdependent. In such an environment, no \r\ncountry can succeed on its own, even if a country is not \r\nan island State like mine. To achieve global security and \r\nprosperity, we need to work with one another to seek \r\nwin-win outcomes. I realize that, inevitably, there will \r\nbe competition and rivalry between States, especially \r\namong the major Powers. But I want to make this point: \r\nrelations between States need not be a zero-sum game. \r\nAll countries benefit when there is peace and stability, \r\nand that is essential for building partnerships and \r\neconomic cooperation everywhere.\r\nThree elements are crucial for the survival \r\nand prosperity of small States: first, a rules-based \r\nmultilateral world order; secondly, international \r\npartnership and cooperation; and, thirdly, sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Allow me to elaborate.\r\nOn the first point, a rules-based multilateral system \r\nenables all States to deal with each other in a fair, \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n10/53 16-29823\r\ntransparent and predictable manner. The United Nations \r\nrepresents an international world order based on rules, \r\nnorms and principles. We emphatically reject the notion \r\nthat might is right. That is why small States are often the \r\nstrongest proponents of the United Nations. For us, the \r\nUnited Nations represents a rules-based international \r\norder, and we believe that is a precondition for our very \r\nexistence as independent, sovereign States.\r\nThe second essential element is international \r\npartnership and cooperation. Some of the most \r\nsignificant challenges of our time are transnational \r\nin nature. Examples include global economic growth, \r\nclimate change, epidemics and terrorism. Therein lies \r\nthe importance of the United Nations.\r\nThe recent successful conclusion of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change last November was a \r\ngood example of how countries around the world could \r\ncome together to solve a problem posed to the global \r\ncommons. That the Paris Agreement will likely enter \r\ninto force less than seven months after it was opened for \r\nsignature is a confidence-booster for the United Nations \r\nsystem. Singapore is proud to have played its part by \r\nactively participating in negotiations and to have been \r\npart of the early wave of countries that deposited their \r\ninstruments of ratification at the high-level event on \r\nthe entry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange on 21 September this year.\r\nA collective voice for small States speaks louder, \r\nand our collective action has been an effective catalyst \r\nfor change at the United Nations and globally. I am \r\npleased to note that, under the chairmanships of \r\nGrenada, Nauru and now Maldives, the Alliance of \r\nSmall Island States played a catalytic role during the \r\nclimate-change negotiations. Similarly, the Forum \r\nof Small States brings together 107 member States to \r\nexchange ideas and support each other in our common \r\nconcerns. The Global Governance Group, also known \r\nas the 3-G, provides a platform for approximately 30 \r\nsmall and medium-sized countries to exchange views \r\non global governance and contribute to the discussions \r\nof the Group of 20 (G-20). The 3-G has helped to \r\nchannel the views of a broad range of countries to the \r\nG-20 presidency, thereby making the G-20 process \r\nmore inclusive.\r\nThe third important element for the survival and \r\nprosperity of small States is sustainable development. \r\nSingapore believes that there are two key prerequisites \r\nfor the successful implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\nThe first prerequisite is the rule of law. I made the \r\npoint earlier that, at the international level, a rules-\r\nbased system is essential for all States, especially small \r\nStates, in order for us to cooperate and to safeguard \r\nour rights. But a commitment to the rule of law at the \r\ndomestic level is equally important. Without good \r\ngovernance, transparency, strong institutions and a \r\nclear legal framework, development can neither be \r\nsustainable nor benefit ordinary people.\r\nThe second prerequisite in that context is international \r\npartnerships. The Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) can be achieved only through collaboration and \r\npartnership. Multilateral processes, such as the third \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Housing and Sustainable \r\nUrban Development (Habitat III), to be held in Ecuador \r\nin October, are important avenues to help advance \r\nthe SDGs, especially SDG 11. The draft new urban \r\nagenda to be adopted by the Habitat III Conference will \r\nhighlight the link between urbanization and sustainable \r\ndevelopment and provide a framework for cities and \r\nGovernments around the world to collaborate and find \r\nsustainable solutions.\r\nAnother important issue that requires cooperation \r\ninvolves the sustainable management of our forests, \r\nthe prevention of land degradation and the loss of \r\nbiodiversity form. This issue is addressed by SDG 15 \r\nin the 2030 Agenda. In South-East Asia, transboundary \r\nhaze from forest and peatland fires started by human \r\nbeings have impaired the health of millions of people, \r\ncompromised the safety of aircraft navigation, damaged \r\nour regional economies and accelerated climate change. \r\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) \r\nadopted a road map to achieve what we hope will be \r\na haze-free ASEAN by 2020. We need to strengthen \r\npartnerships among Governments, the private sector, \r\ncivil-society organizations and other important \r\nstakeholders with a view to addressing the root of the \r\nproblem. That is a long-term challenge that requires \r\nsustained attention and continued collaboration among \r\ncountries in our region and beyond.\r\nDeveloping countries need international support \r\nand assistance in implementing the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. Singapore is fully committed \r\nto helping other developing countries build capacity \r\nand enhance human capital, and I declare this on behalf \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 11/53\r\nof a country that has only human resources and human \r\ncapital to offer.\r\nSince 1992, the Singapore Cooperation Programme \r\nhas provided training to more than 100,000 officials \r\nfrom other developing countries. Last year, in a \r\nstatement made at the United Nations Summit for the \r\nadoption of the post-2015 development agenda, we \r\nlaunched from this rostrum (see A/70/PV.10) a new \r\nsustainable development programme through which we \r\nare working with such United Nations agencies as the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, UN-Water \r\nand UN-Habitat to support fellow developing countries \r\nin implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Singapore has also tailored training \r\nprogrammes for small island developing States in areas \r\nincluding sustainable development, climate change and \r\npublic governance.\r\nSmall States make up more than half of the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. To quote Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon’s statement at the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the Forum of Small States, in 2012,\r\n“Being small does not mean the absence of big \r\nideas”.\r\nThe Secretary-General has been a strong \r\nsupporter of small States, and we thank him for \r\nhis leadership and support. I think we should also \r\nrecognize the important contributions he has made \r\nto sustainable development and climate change \r\nduring his two terms as Secretary-General.\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that small States, despite \r\nour size, have made significant contributions to the \r\ninternational community. We have helped to build \r\nconsensus and find solutions to key global issues, \r\nincluding climate change. Small States can play an even \r\ngreater role, provided we work together. Ultimately, \r\nsmall States need the United Nations to create the \r\nframework for building partnerships, promoting mutual \r\ndevelopment and pursuing peace and security within a \r\nrules-based multilateral system.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Luis Filipe Lopes Tavares, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Communities and Defence of the Republic of \r\nCabo Verde.\r\nMr. Lopes Tavares (Cabo Verde) (spoke in \r\nPortuguese; English text provided by the delegation): It \r\nis with great pleasure that we participate in this session \r\nof the General Assembly under the wise presidency of \r\nMr. Peter Thomson, at a time when we are facing great \r\nchallenges and witnessing humankind’s legitimate \r\ndesires and aspirations for a world of greater justice and \r\nsolidarity. We are particularly proud and pleased to see \r\na representative from a small island developing State \r\nconducting the work of the Assembly. We wish him \r\nevery success during his term in office and assure him \r\nof the full cooperation and readiness of the delegation \r\nof Cabo Verde.\r\nWe also express our gratitude to his predecessor, \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft, for his excellent work and \r\ncongratulate him on his tireless efforts and dedication, \r\nas well as the transparent and inclusive manner in \r\nwhich he conducted the process of hearing candidates \r\nfor the position of Secretary-General. We are certain \r\nthat, under his guidance, the steps taken in the process \r\nof reform that is under way in the Organization were \r\nimportant ones.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of Cabo Verde, we \r\nwould also like to applaud and thank His Excellency \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon as we approach the \r\nend of his two terms in office. We are grateful for his \r\nwork and efforts aimed at building international peace \r\nand security, seeking relationships based on greater \r\nsolidarity, brotherhood and fairness, combating poverty \r\nand pursuing balanced and sustainable development \r\nfor all. As a small island developing State, Cabo Verde \r\ngreatly appreciated his dedication to building a better \r\nworld, in particular his contribution in successfully \r\norganizing and holding the third International \r\nConference on Small Island Developing States, held \r\nin Samoa, and for bringing about the adoption of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sutainable Development and the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. With regard to the Paris \r\nAgreement, Cabo Verde is pleased with the number of \r\nStates that have ratified it since April.\r\nAs a small island State, Cabo Verde bases its foreign \r\npolicy on the principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and is certain that multilateralism \r\nis the most appropriate way to approach issues on \r\nthe international agenda. Cabo Verde advocates for, \r\nand gives priority to, the consensus to keep pursuing \r\ninternational peace and security, promoting and \r\nfostering dialogue in conflict resolution and defending \r\ninternational law as indispensable elements for the \r\nadvancement of humankind.\r\nWe note with concern that armed conflicts \r\nare proliferating in general, but more particularly \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n12/53 16-29823\r\nin Africa and the Middle East. We have seen the \r\nresurgence of instability in several areas of the world, \r\nthe unprecedented humanitarian crisis leading to the \r\nhigh number of refugees, irregular migrations, massive \r\nviolations of human rights, poverty and lack of social \r\ncohesion, the widening of the inequality between rich \r\nand poorer nations, increasing acts of terrorism and \r\natrocities and the growth of transnational crime, in \r\nparticular drug trafficking. All of those phenomena, \r\nwhich we have been closely observing and cannot \r\nignore, call for and compel us to act collectively.\r\nThe conflicts and sources of tension that persist \r\non the African continent continue to be a concern for \r\nus, particularly the situations in Libya, South Sudan, \r\nSomalia and Mali. Cabo Verde supports the African \r\nUnion in the search for solutions to those problems \r\naffecting the peace and security of our sister nations. \r\nAlso with respect to our continent, we welcome \r\nMorocco’s recent decision to rejoin the African Union. \r\nWe hope that the reasons that compelled its withdrawal \r\nwill be resolved in the framework of strengthened \r\nregional cooperation among the members of the Arab \r\nMaghreb Union, thereby contributing to stability and \r\nsecurity in the Sahel region.\r\nWith respect to the Middle East, Cabo Verde \r\nunderstands the urgency of finding solutions to existing \r\nconflicts and encourages the pursuit of negotiations \r\nas the sole means to that end. We wish to specifically \r\nrefer to the need to resume negotiations leading to a \r\nlasting peace that would allow both States — Israel and \r\nPalestine — to live side by side in peace and security. \r\nIn addition, we encourage the continuation of efforts to \r\nseek a negotiated solution in Syria that would put an end \r\nto the conflict and the suffering of the Syrian people.\r\nTerrorism is a phenomenon that affects all countries \r\nand all regions of the planet either directly or indirectly, \r\nand no one can remain indifferent to the immense \r\nsuffering and violence it brings to entire populations. \r\nAs a global problem, it is one of the most serious threats \r\nto international peace and security, and it therefore \r\nrequires a global response. No country — large or \r\nsmall, rich or poor — is in a position to fight it alone \r\nor effectively.\r\nCabo Verde condemns, without reservations, acts \r\nof terrorism in any form or manifestation. We reaffirm \r\nour willingness and readiness to cooperate with other \r\nStates, as well as with the United Nations system, to \r\nimplement recommendations aimed at preventing \r\nand combating this threat. Accordingly, Cabo Verde \r\nwelcomes the Secretary-General’s Plan of Action to \r\nPrevent Violent Extremism, launched in January, as \r\nwell as the results of the fifth review of the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\r\nTaking into account the iniquities and inequalities \r\nthat exist everywhere in some form, it is the understanding \r\nof my Government that such a scenario compels us \r\nto join forces in our efforts for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. The Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights and the Optional Protocols thereto \r\nconstitute the basis for building more peaceful, just \r\nand inclusive societies, with fundamental rights and \r\nfreedoms at the core of their development. In addition, \r\nwe consider the role of institutions advocating in favour \r\nof human rights and civil society to be indispensable in \r\npromoting the rights inherent to human beings.\r\nAs was highlighted in the high-level thematic \r\ndebate on human rights last July, under the theme \r\n“Human rights at the centre of the global agenda”, the \r\nchallenges associated with climate change, terrorism, \r\nviolent extremism, conflicts and humanitarian crises \r\nrequire not only coordinated actions on all levels, but \r\nalso the continuous fostering of good governance and \r\nthe rule of law.\r\nMassive violations of those rights and the denial \r\nof civil, political, social and cultural rights hinder \r\nthe full achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, particularly the protection of and the enjoyment \r\nof rights by the most vulnerable populations. We are \r\nalso convinced that the right to development constitutes \r\na basic principle for social cohesion and the reduction \r\nof social inequalities within and among nations. \r\nAs we celebrate the thirty-first anniversary of the \r\nVienna Declaration on the Right to Development, it \r\nis important that the principles established therein be \r\nobserved and fulfilled. With respect to protecting the \r\nmost vulnerable, Cabo Verde welcomes the Political \r\nDeclaration adopted at the high-level meeting on HIV/\r\nAIDS (resolution 70/266) in June, which advocates for \r\naccess to treatment, particularly for the most vulnerable, \r\nbased on the principle of non-discrimination and \r\nnon-stigmatization.\r\nCabo Verde recognizes and is concerned with \r\nthe humanitarian crisis resulting from the large \r\nnumber of refugees and migrants and welcomes the \r\norganization and adoption of the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1, annex) \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 13/53\r\nduring the high-level meeting on migrants and refugees \r\non 19 September. We believe that a significant part \r\nof the current difficulties may be overcome through \r\nthe effective implementation of the planned global \r\ncompacts on responsibility-sharing for refugees and on \r\nsafe, regular and orderly migration, which are expected \r\nto be adopted next year. Furthermore, we call for the \r\ncorrect implementation of the international conventions \r\nrelated to that issue and stress the need to fight against \r\nthe root causes of such phenomena.\r\nThe theme chosen for this General Assembly \r\nsession, “The Sustainable Development Goals: a \r\nuniversal push to transform our world”, could not have \r\nbeen more appropriate. The choice was judicious and \r\npertinent. It was judicious because a significant portion \r\nof the work and attention of the United Nations upto \r\n2030 will indeed focus on the achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, and it was pertinent \r\nbecause, one year after the historic adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda, we have the opportunity to express our points \r\nof view on how we intend to achieve the Goals that we \r\nestablished and overcome the challenges that persist \r\nand that could jeopardize the global commitment to \r\nleave no one behind.\r\nFor us, the fulfilment of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development implies enhancing the means \r\nof implementation, particularly financing, technology \r\ntransfer, capacity-building and participation in \r\ninternational trade. Furthermore, we will need to \r\ndevelop the capacity to implement and follow up on \r\na system to monitor national and regional policies, of \r\nwhich the United Nations system must be aware.\r\nThe devastating consequences of natural disasters \r\nresulting from climate change, which have a significant \r\nimpact on the poorest and most vulnerable countries, \r\nremind us of the urgency of implementing the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and the importance \r\nof implementing the recommendations of the Sendai \r\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030. \r\nDeveloping a low-carbon economy and creating \r\nresiliency and capacity to adapt are no longer just \r\nan option for many. They have become essential \r\nrequirements to build a sustainable economy, \r\nparticularly in island and archipelago countries, whose \r\nsurvival is being threatened by climate change.\r\nDespite the challenges inherent in the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda, its ambitious nature \r\noffers a unique opportunity to promote international \r\nsolidarity and cooperation at an unprecedented level in \r\nthe history of humankind. It is therefore against that \r\nbackdrop that the United Nations system will be called \r\nupon to work as a unified front, avoiding duplication, \r\nincreasing the monitoring and application of capacity at \r\nthe national and regional levels, identifying emerging \r\nchallenges, offering solutions that are not one-size-fits-\r\nall, and respecting the idiosyncrasies and specific \r\ncontexts of each country.\r\nI cannot conclude without noting that Cabo Verde, \r\nas a small island State, is striving for the development \r\nof a sustainable and dynamic economy with a robust \r\nprivate sector and strengthened regulatory institutions. \r\nIn order to build a resilient economy that is in line \r\nwith the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals, the \r\nGovernment that I am honoured to be a part of plans to \r\ndevelop strategic partnerships so as to reduce risks and \r\nminimize weaknesses. However, the challenge facing a \r\nsmall and vulnerable country such as Cabo Verde goes \r\nbeyond our national capacity to mobilize technical and \r\nfinancial resources and calls for more coordinated and \r\npredictable support from the international community \r\nin general and the United Nations system in particular.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Frederick Mitchell, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Immigration of the Commonwealth of the Bahamas.\r\nMr. Mitchell (Bahamas): Next year at this time, \r\ngeneral elections will have been held in the Bahamas. \r\nThat means that this is the last time that I will address \r\nthe General Assembly in the present term. For me, it \r\nhas been a special privilege — one that I have cherished \r\nsince I first stepped up to this rostrum back in 2002. \r\nI wanted to do something special this year, which is \r\nwhy I have the honour of having with me some of my \r\nconstituents from the Bahamas, and in particular some \r\nof the religious and civic leaders of the community of \r\nFox Hill, which I represent: Reverend J. Carl Rahming \r\nand Mrs. Rahming, Bishop Carrington Pinder and \r\nMrs. Pinder, Reverend Hartman Nixon and Mrs. Nixon, \r\nReverend Daniel Hall and Mrs. Hall, Reverend Warren \r\nAnderson and Mrs. Anderson and Reverend Sherelle \r\nSaunders. I also recognize the opposition’s spokesman \r\non foreign affairs, the Shadow Minister Hubert \r\nChipman MP and his wife.\r\nIt is the policy of the Government of the \r\nBahamas that there should be, insofar as is possible, a \r\nmulti-partisan consensus on foreign affairs so that there \r\nis a seamless transfer of ideas and policies among the \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n14/53 16-29823\r\nparties. Furthermore, the civic leaders are here because \r\nI wanted to show them that, contrary to a prevailing \r\nnarrative, foreign affairs is not some esoteric academic \r\ndiscipline, but is a real-life exercise connected to the \r\nreal lives of the people in my constituency and to all the \r\nordinary people around the world. I am glad that they \r\nare here.\r\nJack Lew, the Treasury Secretary of the United \r\nStates, talked in a recent television interview about the \r\nvalue of starting a bank account, the value of saving \r\nand the importance of the involvement of ordinary \r\npeople in the economy of his country. It was a telling \r\nmessage. But throughout the Caribbean — where the \r\ntradition has been to provide a child at birth with a bank \r\naccount as a gift at the christening — it has become \r\nvery difficult for a child, not to mention an adult, to \r\nopen a bank account, so much so that many argue that \r\nthere is a disincentive to joining the financial system.\r\nIndeed, not only is that a problem in the Caribbean, \r\nbut a British Minister told me about how one of the \r\nleading politicians in his country could not open an \r\naccount for his 12-year-old daughter because she is \r\nwhat is called a politically exposed person. That is \r\nobviously wrong. The problem is that the overregulation \r\nimposed on countries by the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development has led to negative \r\nunintended consequences. Suddenly, being a politician \r\nor in a politician’s family is to run the risk of being \r\nrefused normal banking services around the world \r\nbecause the risks are too high. That is wrong.\r\nI started my remarks with that concern in order \r\nto bring home starkly what all countries from the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM) region have \r\ndescribed as the dangers of de-risking. What I have \r\ndescribed is a part of that whole cloth. Banks in the \r\ndeveloped world, principally in the United States, are \r\nin some cases refusing to cash the checks of some \r\nCaribbean banks because they say the risk of policing \r\nthe CARICOM banks on the issue of compliance with \r\nthe new rules is too high and the business that banks \r\nget from such transactions is too low. So, such services \r\nhave been stripped away across the Caribbean.\r\nThis is the same Bahamas and Caribbean that tens \r\nof millions of people from the United States and Europe \r\nvisit every year. The visitors expect that all the modern \r\nconveniences and services will be available when they \r\nland to dip their toes in the water and sun themselves \r\non the beach. The Caribbean islands that are described \r\nin their tourist brochures as paradises are being treated \r\nby the developed country banks as if they are Sodom \r\nand Gomorrah thanks to the new financial rules. The \r\nfinancial regulators use pejorative expressions like “tax \r\nhavens” and impose unfair rules and sanctions on those \r\nsocieties, which may prevent valuable remittances \r\nbeing sent to people back home or prevent the payment \r\nof the school fees of Bahamian and CARICOM students \r\nabroad. While such destruction is being wrought on \r\nthose same small countries, they are being asked and \r\nlobbied to vote for one cause or another in the interest of \r\nthe developed countries. But what many of our leaders \r\nand peoples are asking is, “Where is the quid pro quo \r\nin all of this?”\r\nNo CARICOM country, including the Bahamas, is \r\nshielding anyone involved in unlawful behaviour. All \r\napplicable agreements are adhered to and are complied \r\nwith in connection with money-laundering and the \r\nunlawful evasion of taxes. The attacks on the Bahamas \r\nand the CARICOM region are inaccurate and unjust. \r\nThe recent attacks in the press about the Bahamas \r\nfinancial services sector are simply reprehensible and \r\nrepresent violations of international norms. We reject \r\nthem. Normally, one does not seek to make a moral case \r\nin this forum. But there is a dubious moral equivalence \r\nthat is being argued by the developed countries. They \r\nargue that, even though they have laws regarding the \r\nprotection of privacy and private property from illegal \r\nseizure by the State, even though our countries are \r\nindependent and free to do as they wish, the fact that \r\nour countries serve as bankers for those seeking to \r\ntake advantage of tax competition is somehow immoral \r\nbecause it robs the developed world of legitimate \r\nrevenue. But that is simply not true.\r\nThe evidence is that the wealth accumulated in \r\noffshore sectors goes back to the developed countries \r\nand the offshore sectors are therefore of benefit to \r\nthe developed world. We can present another moral \r\nargument. If the societies of the Caribbean collapse \r\nbecause of overregulation by other countries, then the \r\nresult of the destruction of millions of families would \r\nbe the greater moral wrong. If one then argues that it \r\nis immoral to evade one’s responsibility to pay taxes \r\nat home — we agree — we argue that you have a \r\nmoral responsibility to understand that overregulating, \r\nchanging the goalposts, not creating a level playing \r\nfield in the financial services sector and de-risking can \r\nbring about an immoral result. That problem must be \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 15/53\r\nsolved by those who imposed the regulations. It is a \r\nmoral imperative.\r\nThe Bahamas has been pleased to join the United \r\nStates of America and others in the Safe Ocean \r\nNetwork, a global initiative aimed at all aspects of \r\nthe fight against illegal fishing, including detection, \r\nenforcement and prosecution. On last Wednesday, \r\nI had the privilege of depositing our instruments of \r\naccession to the Food and Agriculture Organization \r\nof the United Nations Agreement on Port State \r\nMeasures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, \r\nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing. The desire for \r\nthe safe governance of the oceans has also informed \r\nthe decision of the Bahamas to seek another term on the \r\nCouncil of the International Maritime Organization, \r\nwhere we have established a reputation for upholding \r\nthe highest standards of maritime safety, security and \r\nenvironmental protection. I ask for the support of \r\nMember States for the re-election of the Bahamas to \r\nthat Council.\r\nWe need a broadening and modernization of \r\nthe development-financing indicators used to assess \r\ndevelopment level and development needs. We have \r\nstated, and continue to argue, that gross domestic \r\nproduct per capita should not be the primary determinant \r\nthat determines whether a country qualifies for \r\ninternational economic assistance or concessional \r\naccess to development financing.\r\nAs a demonstration of the importance that the \r\nBahamas attaches to the advancement of women, \r\nMs. Marion Bethel was nominated for a seat on the \r\nCommittee on the Elimination of Discrimination \r\nAgainst Women (CEDAW) and was elected in May. We \r\nbelieve that Ms. Bethel will contribute to CEDAW’s \r\nefforts to advance women’s empowerment and gender \r\nequality. We expect that her experiences on that body \r\nwill increase knowledge in the Bahamas relative the \r\nadvancement of women.\r\nA more vexing problem is how to ensure that young \r\nmales in our society do not fall behind. In all areas of \r\nacademics, young males struggle to survive and keep \r\nup and prepare for participation in our societies. The \r\nGovernment has turned its attention now to remedial \r\nmeasures to ensure that they do not fall further behind. \r\nI am proud to say that there are two young males from \r\nthe Abaco Islands who have joined us as the winners of a \r\nstudent contest that enabled them to win an opportunity \r\nto see this event. They are joined by a young female. \r\nWe are proud to see them here. There is a larger fight \r\nfor the integration of all young men and women into the \r\nformal economy. Young people are the future, and we \r\nhave to ensure that they understand and see that those \r\nprocesses are included in the general economy.\r\nI am pleased to announce that the Bahamas is \r\nseeking election for membership in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the term 2019 to 2021. I ask for the support \r\nof all Member States for the Bahamas to be elected to \r\nthat Council.\r\nEach day, our country of 400,000 people faces \r\nincursions from Haiti and Cuba by people seeking a \r\nbetter way of life. Those incursions are unsustainable \r\nand expensive to police and prevent. That is why we \r\nare working with Cuba and Haiti on that sensitive and \r\nvexing issue, as well as with the United States, which \r\nis the destination of choice. That is also all the more \r\nreason why attention must be paid to closer and more \r\nnormal relations between the United States and Cuba. \r\nWe will also support the continued call for an end to \r\nthe economic embargo on Cuba when the vote comes \r\nbefore the United Nations shortly. Our country is really \r\npleased that elections will be held in Haiti next month. \r\nThe Bahamas has pledged to provide observers to \r\nthose elections.\r\nWe wish to thank the outgoing Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership, vision and tireless \r\nefforts. We thank him for his service and wish him well \r\nin the future.\r\nWe are in the midst of the United Nations \r\nInternational Decade for People of African Descent. \r\nThe CARICOM region and the Bahamas are largely \r\nan African diaspora. During the decade, we have \r\nseen a man of African descent become the head of \r\nthe most powerful country in the world. Thousands of \r\nBahamians and people across the Caribbean took pride \r\nin that example of success. We wish him well as he \r\nleaves office.\r\nThere was a picture of a little black boy in the Oval \r\nOffice of the United States. In the picture, the President \r\nis bending down and allowing that boy to touch his hair. \r\nThe little boy, it seemed, wanted to be sure that someone \r\nlike him with hair like his was actually the President \r\nof the United States. That is the background against \r\nwhich people of African descent encounter negativity \r\nall around the world. Thousands of little black boys \r\nand girls in the Bahamas have taken the success of the \r\nPresident of the United States as an affirmation of hope.\r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n16/53 16-29823\r\nThe wave of shootings by police officers in the \r\nUnited States must not be allowed to damage that image \r\nof that country. We think that it is imperative for our \r\nclosest neighbour, the United States, to understand \r\nthat in the International Decade for People of African \r\nDescent it must do the right thing.\r\nThe President of the United States affirmed that \r\nhe believes in a liberal democracy. We support that \r\nposition. All of the CARICOM countries, including \r\nthe Bahamas, are shining examples, without exception, \r\nof liberal democracies. They feature ideological \r\npluralism, capitalist economies, multiparty States, \r\nregular elections, independent judiciaries with low \r\nlevels of institutional corruption and regular public \r\nconsultations on policies. This world body, then, has \r\na stake in ensuring that the societies of the CARICOM \r\nregion survive. Michael Manley, the late national hero \r\nof Jamaica, made that point in this very forum many \r\ndecades ago.\r\nThree successive Popes — John Paul II, Benedict \r\nand Francis — have all decreed that capitalism must \r\noperate with a moral conscience. Our countries all \r\noperate within that milieu. The Christian values of \r\ntolerance and respect for the sanctity of the individual \r\nand the rule of law remain firm. The millions of tourists \r\nwho visit the region can attest to that fact.\r\nI end where I began, on de-risking and the issues \r\nof climate change. With so many positive attributes, \r\nwhy does it appear that so much is being done to ignore \r\nand undermine the success of our societies, which are \r\nshining examples of what the world says that it desires? \r\nIt is morally perplexing and legally indefensible. We \r\nare small, and we have no armies to deploy to impose \r\na result. We cannot force results. To paraphrase an \r\nAmerican judge, we have only our voice and with that \r\nvoice we say today: the moral cry for help is the moral \r\ndemand for rescue. The United Nations is where we \r\nhave a level playing field. It is the appropriate forum to \r\nmake our case. That is so whether the issue is banking, \r\nfinancial services, climate change, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, financing for development, migration or \r\nsimply survival.\r\nScripture tells us: “Blessed are the poor in spirit, \r\nfor the Kingdom of Heaven is theirs”. It also says, \r\n“Whatever you did for the least of these, you did for \r\nme.” Therefore, as a representative of “the least of \r\nthese”, we use our moral voice today to say that now, \r\nmore than ever, we need the United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call upon His \r\nExcellency Mr. Osman Mohammed Saleh, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the State of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Saleh (Eritrea): This year, the people of Eritrea \r\nhave been celebrating the silver jubilee of their country’s \r\nindependence in 1991. During the difficult years of the \r\nwar for independence, very few people believed that \r\nEritreans and their leadership were capable of that \r\nhistoric achievement, as the odds were overwhelmingly \r\nstacked against them.\r\nUnlike in other liberation struggles, it was both \r\nsuper-Powers — the United States and the Soviet \r\nUnion, and not just one or the other — that sought to \r\ncrush by armed force Eritrea’s aspirations for self-\r\ndetermination. Nevertheless, the Eritrean people and \r\ntheir liberation movement — the Eritrean People’s \r\nLiberation Front, the predecessor of today’s People’s \r\nFront for Democracy and Justice — believed in the \r\njustness of their cause and in their own determination \r\nand capability to win the war fair and square and prevail \r\nin the unequal battle.\r\nThe post-independence struggle to build a nation \r\nhas also been complex and difficult. We have been \r\ncompelled to commit precious human and economic \r\nresources to defend ourselves against wars of aggression \r\nand subversion. We have suffered the occupation of our \r\nsovereign territory in violation of international law and \r\na binding international arbitration ruling. We have been \r\nsubjected to incessant hostility, sanctions, economic, \r\nfinancial and diplomatic pressures, as well as armed \r\nattacks and psychological warfare.\r\nOur people, particularly our youth, were targeted \r\nthrough policies that actively encouraged their \r\nmigration, leading to much suffering and loss of life at \r\nthe hands of human traffickers. The inevitable outcome \r\nof those policies was then presented as evidence against \r\nEritrea. No less an authority than President Obama of \r\nthe United States stated publicly that he had “renewed \r\nsanctions on some of the worst abusers, including... \r\nEritrea”. And he added, “We are partnering with groups \r\nthat help women and children escape from the grip of \r\ntheir abusers”. The objective was regime change, as a \r\nprelude to bringing Eritrea to its knees.\r\nIn the face of that concerted onslaught, few gave \r\nEritrea a fighting chance. We were routinely written \r\noff, and our imminent collapse was predicted with \r\nregularity. However, once again, resilient Eritrea and \r\nEritreans at home and abroad were able to forge the \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 17/53\r\ncapability to resist the onslaught on their nation and \r\nprotect their hard-won freedom through their patriotism, \r\ncohesion, sheer determination and sacrifices. After a \r\ndifficult decade and a half, Eritrea is now on the rise.\r\nThe majority of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals have been achieved. The economy is rebounding. \r\nInfrastructure is being built. Favourable conditions are \r\nbeing created to provide youth with ample opportunities \r\nfor quality education, vocational skills, decent living \r\nconditions and active political participation. The \r\ncountry’s regional and international engagement is \r\ngrowing. The counter-productive policy of isolating \r\nEritrea is slowly but surely failing. The pressures, \r\ncoercion and hostility that Eritrea has faced are by no \r\nmeans exceptional or distinctive. In our region, the \r\nHorn of Africa, they are but one element of a misguided \r\npolicy pursued for over a quarter of a century that has \r\nfuelled violence, conflict, instability and fragmentation, \r\nas well as extremism and terrorism.\r\nThroughout the world there are many nations that \r\ncherish dignity and independent decision-making, that \r\nuphold the sovereign equality of nations, that seek \r\nto chart political and economic paths suited to their \r\nconditions, and that seek to benefit from their human \r\nand natural resources. They have faced the wrath \r\nof those who wish to cling to their domination and \r\nprivileges, and resort to all manner of coercion and \r\nsubversion, including sanctions, blockades and armed \r\ninterventions. Unsustainable policies of greed and \r\npillage and the reckless resort to unilateral pressure and \r\nforce in order to secure unilateral advantage, instead \r\nof seeking common ground and mutual interests, \r\nare leading the world down an extremely dangerous \r\npath. The very survival of the planet and humankind \r\nis in grave danger owing to unsustainable systems \r\nof production and consumption and the attendant \r\nlarge-scale wastage. In that context, Eritrea wishes to \r\npoint out that the pending decision by the United States \r\nto adopt legislation that nullifies national sovereign \r\nimmunity constitutes a violation of international law \r\nand a dangerous precedent with grave implications. \r\nAlthough the challenges and dangers we face are \r\ngrave and stark, our world is still full of possibilities \r\nand opportunities.\r\nThe global balance of power and wealth is \r\nchanging. It features new sources of growth, dynamism \r\nand innovation — not only in the celebrated emerging \r\neconomies, but also in many other countries. In both \r\nindustrialized and developing nations, ordinary \r\npeople are making their voices heard and their actions \r\nfelt by mobilizing, organizing and fighting against \r\ndomination by a privileged few. They are fighting \r\nfor a more equal and just world. Calls for the respect \r\nof international law and norms and for the overhaul \r\nand revitalization of the United Nations and global \r\nfinancial institutions — with a view of making them \r\nmore representative and democratic — are widespread, \r\ninsistent and often backed by concrete initiatives and \r\nconcerted actions.\r\nIn our region, the Horn of Africa, the past two \r\ndecades have generally been a period of missed \r\nopportunities, zero-sum games and repeated conflicts \r\nand setbacks. Even today, the situation remains fraught \r\nwith risk and danger. Yet, recent developments indicate \r\nthe possibility of a new beginning and a relaunching \r\nof the 1990s vision of a peaceful, progressive, \r\neconomically dynamic and cooperative Horn of Africa.\r\nEritrea has often spoken of the hostilities and \r\ninjustices that it has suffered, the difficulties it has \r\nfaced and the valiant struggles of its people. That is \r\nan experience that it shares with many other peoples \r\nand nations. That experience informs our country’s \r\nviews and policies. Yet, Eritrea does not dwell on the \r\npast. Rather, it prefers to look to the future. It is keen \r\non building on its encouraging achievements, so as \r\nto transform its economy and society and achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals by relying mainly on \r\nthe energy, skills and initiative of its people and the \r\njudicious use of its natural resources. \r\nIt is also determined to work actively, constructively \r\nand in collaboration with its neighbours for peace, \r\nstability and prosperity in the Horn of Africa and Red \r\nSea regions. It seeks to foster relations of solidarity \r\nand mutual support with all nations, peoples and \r\norganizations that fight for a world free from the \r\nscourges of war and poverty and for the respect of \r\nhuman dignity. To conclude, Eritrea is resolved to \r\nengage with all nations in modesty and self-confidence.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Wilfred Elrington, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Foreign Trade of Belize.\r\nMr. Elrington (Belize): Allow me at the outset to \r\ncongratulate the President of the General Assembly on \r\nhis election to preside over the seventy-first session \r\nof the Assembly. I wish to assure him of Belize’s \r\nfullest support.\r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n18/53 16-29823\r\nThirty-five years ago, Belize became a State \r\nMember of the United Nations. Membership confirmed \r\nour independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity, \r\nand our place among equals in the community of \r\nnations. Regrettably, however, membership has not \r\nbeen able to resolve the territorial claim laid on our \r\ncountry some 80 years ago by Guatemala.\r\nOur track record since our independence confirms \r\nthat Belize holds sacrosanct the dignity of human \r\nbeings, the principles of justice, equality, inclusivity \r\nand the rule of law. Belizeans are inherently altruistic \r\nand compassionate. In the nascent years of our \r\nindependence, when civil war ravaged our Central \r\nAmerican region, Belize was the beacon of hope \r\nand sanctuary of choice for thousands of refugees, \r\nincluding Guatemalans, desperately seeking to escape \r\nthe scourges of war, poverty and oppression. Belize \r\nwelcomed thousands of refugees, amounting to well \r\nin excess of 30 per cent of our population at the time. \r\nIndeed, even to this day, the f low of migrants into \r\nour country continues unabated. Belize is a nation of \r\nmigrants living in unity, peace and harmony.\r\nOur diversity, national identity and pride have long \r\nbeen a source of strength for our people. We have never \r\ncowered in the face of the repeated threats to our security \r\nby our neighbour, Guatemala. We remain steadfast in \r\nour resolve to protect and preserve our sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. Though many perils lurk along \r\nour forested borders and in our maritime and riverine \r\nterritories, we have been protecting and patrolling our \r\nborders with determination, so as to ensure the safety \r\nand security of our beloved homeland. At the same \r\ntime, our untiring diplomats have striven mightily to \r\nresolve the long-standing territorial dispute, which is \r\nour paramount foreign-policy concern, by using all the \r\ndiplomatic channels and means at their disposal.\r\nRegrettably, though not unpredictably, there \r\nhave been hostile incidents between the civilian and \r\nmilitary personnel of both Belize and Guatemala on \r\nour southern border on the Sarstoon River. Guatemalan \r\nnaval personnel have repeatedly impeded the peaceful \r\ningress and egress of civilian and military Belizeans on \r\nthe river, wrongfully claiming that the river is theirs. \r\nHowever, as the northern side of the river is clearly \r\nBelizean territory, the unimpeded use and enjoyment \r\nof that side of the river is the right of every Belizean \r\ncitizen. Belize has therefore promptly and properly \r\nprotested each attempt to impede our citizens from \r\nusing the river. Additionally, we have engaged our \r\nGuatemalan counterparts in dialogue under the good \r\noffices of the Secretary General of the Organization of \r\nAmerican States with a view of putting a speedy end to \r\nthat potentially perilous practice.\r\nAt the same time, the situation along our western \r\nborder has also been vexing. Continuous illegal entry \r\nby armed trespassers from Guatemala have persisted \r\ndespite the valiant efforts of our border patrol to \r\ndeter them. The trespassers engage with impunity, \r\nday and night, in gold panning, hunting for wild \r\ngame and birds, pillaging Mayan temples, logging \r\nillegally and cultivating crops, including marijuana, \r\nfor commercial purpose. In the process, our priceless \r\nforest is being decimated, our potable and sea waters \r\nare being compromised, and our coral reefs are being \r\nchoked to death by sediments that run off the denuded \r\nmountainsides after each torrential downpour. \r\nFully cognizant of the devastating environmental \r\nimpact that such practices are having in neighbouring \r\ncountries and further afield, Belize cannot afford to \r\nlet the same thing happen to us. From time to time, in \r\nthe course of attempting to apprehend the trespassers, \r\nfirearms have been used by Belize security personnel \r\nand by the trespassers, who are invariably armed. \r\nIndeed, between September 2014 and March 2016, \r\na Belizean Tourism Police officer was killed and a \r\nBelize Defence Force sergeant was ambushed and \r\nshot, though not fatally, by trespassers entering Belize \r\nfrom Guatemala.\r\nTragically, and much to Belize’s regret, on 20 April \r\n2016 a Guatemalan minor was fatally shot and his \r\nfather and brother injured when they came in contact \r\nwith a Belizean patrol in one of our protected national \r\nparks in the dead of night. The Belize Police forthwith \r\nbegan an investigation. Moreover, officials of the \r\nOrganization of American States (OAS), stationed in \r\nthe Adjacency Zone between Belize and Guatemala, \r\nimmediately commenced their own investigation. And, \r\nat the specific behest of Guatemala, Belize requested \r\nthe Secretary General of the Organization of American \r\nStates to launch an official special independent \r\ninvestigation into the incident. The Organization of \r\nAmerican States commissioned two senior eminently \r\nqualified specialists to undertake that special \r\ninvestigation, with the full knowledge and approval \r\nof the Guatemalan Government. At the time of their \r\nappointment, Guatemala expressed no reservations \r\nas to their competence, suitability or otherwise, to \r\nundertake that investigation. Last August, the Special \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 19/53\r\nCommission delivered its findings to the Secretary \r\nGeneral of the Organization of American States.\r\nThe report discloses that the deceased had been \r\ndetained by security personnel in Belize a mere month \r\nprior to the incident. At the time of his detention, he \r\nwas illegally carrying a .22-calibre rif le and was \r\nin illegal possession of wild game. He was neither \r\nmistreated, arrested nor prosecuted by the Belizean \r\nauthorities. Instead, he was promptly sent back safely \r\nto his country. The report further discloses that the \r\ndeceased, his brother, also a minor, and their father \r\nwere knowingly and unlawfully well within Belizean \r\nterritory on the night of the incident, and that none of \r\nthe wounds inflicted was caused by weapons carried \r\nby personnel of the Belize Defence Force. The wounds \r\nwere inflicted by small-calibre firearms carried on \r\nthe night of the incident by two members of a local \r\nconservation-oriented non-governmental organization \r\nthat was part of the Belize patrol. Shots were fired \r\nby both groups, the Guatemalans and the Belizean \r\njoint patrol, on that ill-fated night. And, the following \r\nmorning, elements of the Guatemalan Army, along \r\nwith civilians from a nearby Guatemalan village, \r\nentered Belizean territory illegally, visited the site, \r\ncontaminated the scene and withdrew and withheld \r\nevidentiary material that could have been useful to \r\nthe investigation.\r\nIn the wake of the incident, Guatemala launched \r\na fanatical public-relations campaign against Belize, \r\nfalsely alleging that the Belize Defence Force was \r\nresponsible for the death of the minor. In addition, the \r\nGuatemalan President publicly announced the massing \r\nof troops along our western and southern borders.\r\nHowever, the report of the Special Independent \r\nCommission chronicles what really took place on the \r\nnight of the incident. The objective, impartial findings \r\nof fact established the correctness of Belize’s position \r\nfrom the start, and the wholly erroneous nature of the \r\nallegations levelled against our country by Guatemala. \r\nThe report completely absolves Belize of any and all \r\nblame for the incident. It makes manifest the wrongness \r\nof Guatemala’s accusation against Belize and against \r\nthe personnel of our Belize Defence Force. Guatemala \r\nhas since then publicly rejected the Commission’s \r\nreport. However, it is certainly irresponsible, if not \r\nreprehensible and utterly unacceptable, that Guatemala \r\nshould now seek to reject the results of a process that \r\nit had specifically requested and agreed to and which \r\nwas conducted by OAS-appointed independent third-\r\ncountry professionals with impeccable credentials and \r\nwith no axe to grind. Moreover, the wanton threat of the \r\nuse of force by a nation against its neighbour is wholly \r\nuncalled for, recklessly dangerous and in clear violation \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and can in no way \r\nbe countenanced.\r\nBelize’s only wish is to live in peace and harmony \r\nwith all its neighbours, including Guatemala. We \r\nfully appreciate that with each passing day, with more \r\nand more Guatemalans trespassing into our country, \r\ndespoiling our natural resources and engaging in \r\nillegal and destructive activities, the potential for \r\nviolent incidents and conflicts has become increasingly \r\nprobable and problematic. That situation makes a prompt \r\nand peaceful end to the anachronistic and unfounded \r\nterritorial claim on our country an urgent imperative.\r\nBelize acknowledges the centrality of the United \r\nNations in the multilateral order and as a uniting force \r\nfor championing the common good. Its leadership \r\nlikewise remains central to international peace and \r\nsecurity, to development and to the rule of law. The \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is truly a \r\nhistorical milestone for the entire world. The essence \r\nof sustainable development is entrenched in the Belize \r\nConstitution. Our economic development has fully \r\nembraced the indivisibility of social and environmental \r\npolicies. From the early 1990s, Belize began to put in \r\nplace development plans for its f ledgling industries \r\nthat are consistent with a progressive legal regime for \r\nenvironmental protection.\r\nComplementary to those economic and \r\nenvironmental developments, Belize is incrementally \r\nproviding free public education at the primary and \r\nsecondary levels. It has established a Maya Land \r\nRights Commission so as to implement measures for \r\nthe identification and protection of rights arising \r\nfrom Mayan customary land tenure. It is rolling out \r\na national health-insurance policy, and work is in \r\nprogress to advance national efforts towards gender \r\nequality and equity.\r\nThe national debate on social issues recently \r\ntook a turn that could set a precedent. A High Court \r\nruling held that Section 53 of our Criminal Code, \r\nwhich criminalizes consensual sexual acts between \r\nsame-sex partners, is unconstitutional. The ruling \r\nalso expands the definition of “sex” to include sexual \r\norientation. However, in response to the request of a \r\nnot inconsiderable segment of our population, our \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n20/53 16-29823\r\nGovernment has launched a limited appeal against the \r\njudgment, challenging only the expanded definition of \r\n“sex” by the High Court.\r\nIn April, Belize was among the first countries to \r\nsign and ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nWe also commend the United States of America and \r\nChina for their leadership for doing so as well. Belize \r\nfully supports efforts, under the auspices of the United \r\nNations, to design a new international treaty for the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction, and \r\nwelcomes the decision to convene a high-level United \r\nNations conference to support the implementation of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14 in June 2017.\r\nIn that spirit of inclusiveness, Belize urges \r\nthat the Republic of China on Taiwan be accorded \r\nmeaningful participation in the work of the United \r\nNations. The Taiwanese Government has been working \r\nassiduously to promote international cooperation and \r\ndevelopment, in line with the spirit and principles of \r\nthe Millennium Development Goals. It has also fully \r\nembraced the Sustainable Development Goals. We \r\nurge the international community to welcome Taiwan’s \r\nmeaningful participation in the mechanisms, meetings \r\nand activities of the United Nations specialized \r\nagencies, including the World Health Organization, the \r\nInternational Civil Aviation Organization and the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change.\r\nSetbacks in the global economy and externalities \r\nresulting from institutional policies, both public \r\nand private, to safeguard against financial and other \r\nsecurity risks, as well as the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange, have all conspired against Belize’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment trajectory. Today, we are rebuilding our \r\ncountry in the aftermath of Hurricane Earl, which in \r\nless than eight hours resulted in the loss of some 5.5 per \r\ncent of our gross domestic product.\r\nBelize fully endorses the views and sentiments that \r\nall other delegations have expressed in their pleas for \r\nurgent relief from the deleterious consequences of the \r\ndecisions by global banks to withdraw correspondent \r\nbanking relationships from our financial institutions.\r\nBelize celebrated its thirty-fifth anniversary of \r\nindependence on the same day as the International \r\nDay of Peace. Peace and stability in our hemisphere \r\nare critical to the development and well-being of the \r\npeoples of the Americas. For that reason, Belize \r\nremains concerned about the status of the controversy \r\nbetween Guyana and Venezuela. We urge the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to urgently exercise his authority under the \r\n1966 Agreement to resolve the controversy over the \r\nfrontier between Venezuela and British Guiana in order \r\nto arrive at a choice of options that would definitively \r\nsettle the border controversy.\r\nBelize strictly adheres to the principle of \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of sovereign \r\nStates. In that regard, we stand in solidarity with the \r\nGovernment and the people of Venezuela in their efforts \r\nto resolve their domestic issues in accordance with their \r\nlaws and Constitution. We also remain very concerned \r\nabout the unabated cholera epidemic in Haiti, and urge \r\nthe United Nations to take all necessary steps to help \r\nthe Haitian people end that terrible scourge, occasioned \r\nby agents of the United Nations. Belize welcomes \r\nthe tremendous progress already made in the peace \r\nprocess in Colombia, which we fully support. We look \r\nforward to an early and successful implementation of \r\nthe agreement. We also commend the progress made \r\nin the bilateral relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates. Belize reiterates its call for an early end to the \r\neconomic embargo against Cuba.\r\nWe join others in calling for an early end to the \r\ntragic conflicts in Syria and Libya, which are an affront \r\nto humanity. We adhere fully to the right of peoples \r\nto self-determination, and reiterate our solidarity \r\nwith the struggle for liberation and independence \r\nof our Sahrawi brothers and sisters. Belize remains \r\ndisheartened, although not discouraged, by the \r\nintractable Israeli-Palestinian conflict. We believe \r\nthat the only just solution to that conflict is one that \r\nresults in two sovereign and independent States, living \r\nside by side in peace and security within secure and \r\nrecognized borders.\r\nWe stand in solidarity with South Korea in the \r\nface of North Korea’s irresponsible experiments with \r\nnuclear and missile programmes, including the conduct \r\nof nuclear tests, in violation of Security Council \r\nresolutions. We join the international community in \r\ncondemning those actions, which pose a clear and \r\npresent danger not only to South Korea, but to the \r\nentire world.\r\nWhile we are heartened by the indefatigable \r\nefforts of the United Nations and other philanthropic \r\norganizations and individuals to alleviate the suffering \r\nof migrants and other displaced persons worldwide, it is \r\nevident that much more needs to be done. We in Belize \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 21/53\r\npledge to do all in our power and within our means to \r\ndischarge our obligations to all suffering persons who \r\nseek our succour.\r\nIn a country as small as Belize, in a world as big as \r\nours, we are all citizens of planet Earth, big or small. The \r\npolicies that we devise at any level must be reflective of \r\nthat reality. It is up to us leaders, working together and \r\nshouldering our respective sovereign responsibilities, \r\nto ensure that every nation, large and small, and every \r\nindividual, man, woman or child, shall have a say in \r\nour noble endeavours to achieve a more just, equitable \r\nand secure world. Our task is clear. Its attainment is not \r\nimpossible, but neither is it without difficulty. Let us \r\nget it done. Belize stands ready to do its part.\r\nIn conclusion, as Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nis beginning to prepare to leave office at the end of 10 \r\nsterling years of service to the United Nations and to \r\nthe world as a whole, Belize takes this opportunity to \r\nthank him and to wish him every success in his post-\r\nSecretary-General life. We also take this opportunity to \r\nthank the United States President, Barack Obama, as he \r\ntoo prepares to leave office later this year. We wish him \r\nevery success in his post-presidential life.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Niermala Badrising, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Suriname.\r\nMs. Badrising (Suriname): On behalf of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, President of \r\nthe Republic of Suriname, I extend to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, Mr. Thomson, congratulations \r\non his election to preside over the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-first session. His wealth of experience will \r\nundoubtedly contribute to the successful discharge of \r\nhis important duties.\r\nI would like to pay tribute to outgoing Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his accomplishments in \r\nleading the Organization over the past 10 years and \r\nfor his continuous endeavours to reorganize the United \r\nNations. We especially applaud his efforts to promote \r\nsustainable development and his commitment to the \r\nbetterment of the livelihood of vulnerable groups and \r\nto the advancement of women. The Government and the \r\npeople of the Republic of Suriname wish the Secretary-\r\nGeneral much success in his future, new challenges.\r\nAs we continue our deliberations and take \r\ndecisions on pertinent issues with respect to the global \r\nagenda, the world is facing grave financial, economic, \r\nenvironmental and political crises. That situation \r\nis in contrast to what is needed for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of all nations, namely, peace, political \r\nstability, democracy and universal access to our planet’s \r\nresources.\r\nAt the same time, we are concerned by the multitude \r\nof challenges and threats that the world now faces in the \r\npolitical, security, economic and social realms. They \r\ninclude the global recession and economic slowdown, \r\nwhich have caused decreasing growth and productivity; \r\nworsening inequalities that are causing increased \r\nviolence, political instability and social deterioration; \r\ntransnational organized crime and terrorism; and \r\ndigital and technological innovation.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nplaces human beings at the centre of development. \r\nThe implementation of the ambitious Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals gives us the opportunity to fight \r\nfor a just world order in order to achieve peace, \r\nequitable power relations in the world, and political \r\nand social stability, as well as an equal distribution of \r\nwealth and opportunities for all. That would imply that \r\neventually the eradication of poverty and the promotion \r\nof economic growth could be attained.\r\nNevertheless, there is a wide gap between what \r\nwe promise our peoples in international and regional \r\nforums and what is actually achieved. Suriname believes \r\nthat we must build peaceful and inclusive societies with \r\nequal opportunities for all. It is therefore essential \r\nthat our social and economic order be structurally \r\nreformed and that we focus on advancing innovation \r\nand new technologies, human knowledge, capacities \r\nand skills. That is needed in order ultimately to find \r\na solution that will create opportunities to accumulate \r\nknowledge, increase employment and social protection, \r\nenhance social inclusion and protect the environment, \r\nall of which will eventually lead to sustainable growth \r\nand stability.\r\nIt is not by chance that the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development also deals with migration, nor \r\nis it a coincidence that we have been discussing migration \r\nas a top priority of the international community. The \r\nmovement of people across international borders — be \r\nit as migrants, refugees or asylum-seekers — continues \r\nto be one of the most important issues on the global \r\npolicy agenda, for it has enormous economic, social and \r\ncultural implications. As far as refugees and asylum-\r\nseekers are concerned, Suriname holds the view that \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n22/53 16-29823\r\ninternational norms, values and principles must be \r\nupheld and that human rights must be respected.\r\nSuriname attaches great importance to the \r\nprinciples of international law, under which we have \r\ncommitted both to refrain from unilateral interference \r\nin the domestic affairs of other countries and to \r\nrespect their national sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity. That is also essential for securing peace, \r\ninternational security and lasting prosperity for all \r\nnations, regions and peoples. We believe that the \r\nonly way to create a culture of peace and justice is \r\nthrough dialogue, consensus-building and negotiated \r\nresolutions to conflicts. Long-lasting political stability \r\nrequires that democracy and democratic principles be \r\nrespected; democratic traditions must be upheld, and \r\nthe legitimacy of democratically elected Governments \r\nmust be recognized for the duration of their tenure.\r\nA long-standing issue on our international agenda \r\nis the struggle of the Palestinian people. Suriname \r\nsupports the two-State solution for both the Israeli \r\nand Palestinian peoples in order to attain the political \r\nstability needed for their development. In our region \r\nof the world, South America, we welcome the historic \r\npeace agreement that is to be signed today between the \r\nGovernment of Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas \r\nRevolucionarias de Colombia. It upholds the principles \r\nof coexistence, cooperation and respect, and reinforces \r\nour hemisphere as a zone of peace, as declared in 2014 \r\nduring the third Summit of the Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States. We also welcome the \r\nongoing process to restore diplomatic relations between \r\nCuba and the United States of America, which will \r\ncontribute to further enhancing peace, stability, unity \r\nand development in the Americas. We will continue to \r\nsupport the call by the international community to have \r\nthe United States lift the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo against Cuba.\r\nGlobal temperatures and sea levels are rising, \r\nice caps are melting, and greenhouse-gas emissions \r\nare not yet diminishing. With a forest cover of \r\nwell over 90 per cent and a deforestation rate of \r\nmerely 0.02 per cent, Suriname is one of the few \r\ncarbon-negative countries in the world. Its relatively \r\nsmall size and population — a surface area of 163,000 \r\nsquare kilometres and a population of 550,000 — make \r\nit particularly vulnerable to global environmental \r\nchallenges and external economic shocks. In addition, \r\nas a country with a low-lying coastal zone and with the \r\nmajority of its population and fertile soils at risk from \r\nthe dangers of rising sea levels, Suriname’s sustainable \r\ndevelopment efforts are under serious threat.\r\nNevertheless, we are still prepared to contribute to \r\nreducing greenhouse gases and to implementing even \r\nmore ambitious policies. However, we cannot do that on \r\nour own, and we therefore call upon the international \r\ncommunity not only to develop technical and financial \r\nsupport mechanisms within existing financial \r\nframeworks, but also to make new and additional \r\nfinancing available in order to support developing \r\ncountries like ours. That will allow us to implement \r\nessential adaptation policies and programmes, \r\ncompensate for losses and damages, develop technology \r\nand safeguard food production and food security.\r\nThe consequences of the global economic \r\nslowdown are being felt throughout the world, and \r\nSuriname has not been spared. Faced with a drop in the \r\ninternational prices of the commodities that we export, \r\nlast year we were forced to implement an adjustment \r\nand reform programme that has imposed difficult but \r\nnecessary adjustment measures. In order to ensure that \r\nthe adjustment runs smoothly and to secure technical \r\nassistance for our reform programme, the Government \r\nof Suriname signed a stand-by arrangement with the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund early in 2016. In the \r\nlight of the positive results achieved in a short period \r\nof time, we reiterate our intention to continue to work \r\nin close collaboration with the Fund, with the goal of \r\nsecuring macroeconomic stability and carrying out \r\nthe institutional and legal reforms needed to restore \r\neconomic growth and social stability.\r\nWe are confident that with international commodity \r\nprices on a steady path of recovery and with the grants \r\nand soft loans that we have been able to acquire through \r\nour friendly bilateral relationships and multilateral \r\npartners, as well as through international financial \r\ninstitutions such as the Caribbean Development Bank, \r\nthe Inter-American Development Bank and the Islamic \r\nDevelopment Bank, my country’s development path \r\nwill be back on track within the next two years.\r\nWe therefore thank all of those who have offered \r\ntheir assistance in recent years, and we also welcome \r\nforeign investors who wish to participate in our future \r\ndevelopment. Suriname is a country with many natural \r\nresources and excellent opportunities for outsourced \r\nproduction processes. We recognize that we will have to \r\nexploit our resources commercially if we are to sustain \r\nour economic growth, and diversify our economy, \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 23/53\r\nwhich will include a shift from complete dependence \r\non minerals and developing new sectors, such as agro-\r\nindustry and tourism.\r\nIn order to achieve sustainable development, \r\nworld peace and stability for our nations and peoples, \r\njoint and consensual endeavours are required, as well \r\nas greater cooperation and dialogue. The relevance \r\nof multilateralism has proved to be essential for our \r\ncoordinated actions. Suriname recognizes the eminent \r\nrole that the United Nations plays in ensuring lasting \r\ndevelopment and peace, and we pledge our unwavering \r\ncommitment to the work of the Organization.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Denis Moses, Minister for Foreign and CARICOM \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nMr. Moses (Trinidad and Tobago): I am honoured \r\nto have been given once again the opportunity to \r\naddress the Assembly, which is composed of States that \r\nare tasked with charting the way forward on a range of \r\nissues that impact our collective development and well-\r\nbeing.\r\nAllow me first to extend congratulations to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, on his election to lead the Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session. His election comes almost one year \r\nafter the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, in which the international community \r\ncommitted to changing its approach to development to \r\none that is people-centred, planet-focused, grounded \r\nin the principle of sustainability, and which endorses \r\na balanced approach across the economic, political \r\nand social aspects of development. The election of a \r\nrepresentative of a small island developing State to the \r\npresidency of this body is symbolic of the imperative \r\nfor universal action and the contribution that must be \r\nmade by all Members, regardless of size, economy, \r\nreligion or demography, so as to ensure a trajectory of \r\nsustainable growth and development for humankind \r\nand life on earth.\r\nAllow me to also express our gratitude to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark, \r\nwho as President of the Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession further advanced the Office’s high standard of \r\ntransparency and accountability. Under his stewardship, \r\nnotable progress was made towards the revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly, and its members fully identified \r\nthe priorities for which action is deemed imperative to \r\nensuring our common journey to 2030.\r\nThe scope of the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) covers the multitudinous \r\nthreats to our collective well-being and the longevity \r\nof our civilization. From the existential hazard caused \r\nby unmitigated climate change to the insidious threats \r\nof violence, extremism and terrorism, to the crises \r\nof forced displacement and the spread of infectious \r\ndiseases and illnesses, such as Ebola, chikungunya \r\nand zika, it is clear that the challenges of our time far \r\nexceed the limits of geography and demography and \r\ntherefore diminish the efficacy of unilateral responses. \r\nHowever, as grave as the threats we collectively face, \r\nwhat is even more compelling is the opportunity \r\npresented to our United Nations to chart the course \r\nof meaningful and universal growth and prosperity \r\nby deepening our partnership and cooperation. Such \r\nan approach will allow for a reversal of the current \r\npatterns of inequality and insecurity and transform our \r\ncollective circumstances into those that will redound to \r\nthe benefit of all humanity.\r\nThe pathway to that transformation lies in the \r\ncreation of meaningful and innovative partnerships to \r\nfacilitate the full and universal implementation of the \r\nSDGs. The leadership imperative of our time requires \r\nthat we strike an appropriate balance between national \r\ninterest and the global good and, accordingly, that we \r\nadopt a deeply cooperative and constructive approach to \r\ncarving out a future of prosperity for our and succeeding \r\ngenerations. I am therefore grateful for the opportunity \r\nto address the Assembly yet again and, in this general \r\ndebate on the aptly selected theme, “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”, to share the perspectives of the Government of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, a small island developing State, as \r\na responsible and committed partner in the multilateral \r\npursuit of a sustainable future.\r\nA little more than a year ago in this very Hall, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago joined other members in adopting \r\nthe ambitious and inclusive 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, and thereby heralded a new phase of \r\nenhanced multilateralism in pursuit of a common goal. \r\nThis groundbreaking Agenda, bolstered by a renewed \r\nspirit of global solidarity, compels each of us to join \r\ntogether in international cooperation and partnership \r\nto profoundly improve the lives of our fellow humans \r\nwithout discrimination or prejudice.\r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n24/53 16-29823\r\nHaving adopted the Agenda, we are all now \r\ntasked with determining the best way forward for its \r\noperationalization and implementation, according to \r\nour respective domestic circumstances. As evidence of \r\nits unreserved commitment to the achievement of the \r\noverarching objective of the 2030 Agenda and the full \r\nimplementation of the SDGs, the Government of the \r\nRepublic of Trinidad and Tobago is placing the principles \r\nenshrined in the Agenda at the nucleus of its National \r\nDevelopment Plan for Trinidad and Tobago, Vision \r\n2030. Our Vision 2030 national plan, currently in the \r\nfinal stages of elaboration, aligns with the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Trinidad and Tobago recognizes \r\nthat the 2030 Agenda is a transformative plan of action \r\nfor people, the planet and prosperity through peace and \r\npartnership. Accordingly, the Government of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago is committed to its full implementation \r\nthrough the mainstreaming of the principles of \r\nsustainability throughout its policy spectrum.\r\nThe thrust of the 2030 Agenda for global \r\ntransformation, with no one left behind, calls for action \r\nto enhance the quality of life of all segments of society, \r\nincluding the systematically marginalized groups. \r\nAmong them are women, girls and the differently abled, \r\nwho have historically been denied the equitable access \r\nto opportunity and mobility that would have ensured \r\ntheir participation in society as equal partners with \r\nmen and enhanced not only their own quality of life and \r\nhappiness, but also that of their families, communities \r\nand society as a whole. It is deeply regrettable that \r\nwomen and girls and the differently abled continue \r\nto be denied fundamental human rights and freedoms \r\nin many parts of the world. Women do not receive \r\nequal pay for equal work, and they are systematically \r\nprevented from obtaining an education and reaching \r\ntheir full potential as human beings and as citizens.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago remains committed to raising \r\nthe standard of living and welfare of all members of \r\nthe national community, the enhancement of the \r\neducational system, improving the delivery of health \r\ncare and providing a higher level of accessibility and \r\nsupport to persons with disabilities. That commitment \r\nhas been a long-standing position of the Government of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, which has enacted several laws, \r\npolicies and other measures to promote and strengthen \r\nthe role of women and girls in society and their overall \r\ncontribution to national development.\r\nOne of the defining challenges of our time is that \r\nof addressing the issue of climate change and global \r\ntemperature increase. Notwithstanding the minuscule \r\ncontribution to absolute global carbon emissions of small \r\nisland developing States such as Trinidad and Tobago, \r\nunmitigated climate change represents an existential \r\nthreat for us. The future viability and existence of \r\nour island State is dependent on the urgency and \r\nambitiousness of the global response to reversing the \r\nalready unsustainable trend of the global temperature \r\nincrease. Consequently, Trinidad and Tobago joins \r\nthe international community in endorsing the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change as a sign of hope for \r\nthe future. We especially wish to emphasize that the \r\nAgreement prioritizes the need for global action on the \r\ncritical issue of climate change, an approach which, for \r\nus, is absolutely imperative if we are to have a chance \r\nof averting its most dangerous effects.\r\nThe adoption of the Paris Agreement signalled to \r\nthe world that, in the words of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon, “the spirit of multilateralism is strong”. That \r\nspirit must continue to see us through to early entry \r\ninto force and implementation of the Agreement. In \r\nkeeping with that sentiment, Trinidad and Tobago \r\njoined 174 other Member States in becoming a signatory \r\nof the Paris Agreement in April. Trinidad and Tobago \r\nrecognizes that the conversation surrounding the Paris \r\nAgreement is now focused on building momentum \r\ntowards its early entry into force. To that end, the \r\nTrinidad and Tobago Government is actively addressing \r\nthe issue of ratification.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago also looks forward to \r\ndeliberations at the upcoming twenty-second session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, to be \r\nheld in Marrakech, Morocco, and to working towards \r\nthe full and effective implementation of the Paris \r\nAgreement and supporting international cooperation \r\non the mitigation, adaptation and compliance on a scale \r\nthat will ensure that the increase in the average global \r\ntemperature is limited to 1.5°C.\r\nAlthough the economy of Trinidad and Tobago is \r\nlargely dependent on the hydrocarbon and petrochemical \r\nindustries, we are committed to the processes under \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange. Accordingly, the Government has instituted \r\nincentives to encourage investment and job creation in \r\nrenewable and clean technologies in the transportation \r\nand industrial sectors. The Government has aggressively \r\npursued a national economic diversification strategy, \r\na strategy which will also strengthen Trinidad and \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 25/53\r\nTobago’s resilience to exogenous shocks in global \r\nmarkets. Trinidad and Tobago continues to explore \r\ninnovative measures to bolster its economic stability \r\nand its capacity to remain properly integrated in the \r\nglobal financial and trade architecture.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nrecognizes that national development efforts need to \r\nbe supported by an enabling international economic \r\nenvironment through international business activities \r\nand finance, international development cooperation \r\nand international trade. However, the issue of financial \r\ninstitutions terminating or restricting correspondent \r\nbanking relations in the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM) region has destabilized the financial \r\nsectors of our member States and has disrupted the \r\nregion’s growth and economic progress. The cessation \r\nof correspondent banking relations by international \r\nbanks, despite CARICOM compliance with the \r\nrecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on \r\nMoney Laundering and the Organization for Economic \r\nCooperation and Development’s Global Forum on \r\nTaxation, undermines our efforts to truly build a \r\nglobal partnership that will achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. The Government of Trinidad and \r\nTobago therefore joins its partners in the Caribbean \r\ncommunity in calling for international banks to engage \r\nin collaboration with affected member States to restore \r\nnormal financial relationships between domestic banks \r\nand international markets.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda also recognizes that sustainable \r\ndevelopment can be realized only in a peaceful, \r\nsecure and stable environment free of war and \r\nconflict. Transnational organized crime and violence, \r\npiracy, trafficking in persons, cybercrime and illicit \r\ntrafficking in small arms and light weapons pose a \r\ndaunting challenge to the security of all States, but \r\nespecially small island developing States (SIDS). It is \r\nthe experience of Trinidad and Tobago, as a small island \r\ndeveloping State, and of the Caribbean Community as \r\na whole, that those challenges undermine our efforts \r\nto achieve sustainable development, threatening the \r\nlivelihoods of our people and the rule of law. Such \r\nthreats can have the potential to affect regional and \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nConsequently, at the international level, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, together with CARICOM, fully subscribes \r\nto the Arms Trade Treaty, with the aim of preventing \r\narmed violence in the region and freeing many from \r\nthe deadly tyranny associated with a prevalence of \r\nunregulated small arms and light weapons. Since 2010, \r\nTrinidad and Tobago has also introduced and sponsored \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 68/33, on women, \r\ndisarmament, non-proliferation and arms control, \r\nencouraging women’s participation in all disarmament, \r\nnon-proliferation and arms-control decision-making \r\nprocesses at the local, regional and national levels.\r\nEnsuring the security, health and social \r\ndevelopment of our people continues to be a major \r\npriority for Trinidad and Tobago. Like many others, \r\nour country has not escaped the effects of the illicit \r\ndrug trade and its associated ills. We have come to \r\nrealize that in the context of sustainable development, \r\nour people’s continued development cannot be divorced \r\nfrom the proliferation of that illicit trade and its \r\nconcomitant problems. It is widely acknowledged that \r\nthe world drug problem and the illicit drug economy \r\nhave the ability to destabilize vulnerable States in \r\nmany different ways. In order to deal with the problem, \r\nthe Government of Trinidad and Tobago is using its \r\nnational development agenda to launch initiatives to \r\nmitigate the socioeconomic conditions that are both \r\nthe cause and result of the problems related to drug use \r\nand trafficking. The initiatives are fully aligned with \r\nour overall policy direction and the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nIt seems fitting that I am addressing the Assembly \r\non 26 September, the International Day for the Total \r\nElimination of Nuclear Weapons. Trinidad and Tobago \r\nwould like to stress that using the nuclear option \r\nwould have severe humanitarian and other devastating \r\nconsequences for the peoples of the world. We therefore \r\nreiterate our call for denuclearizing every region of the \r\nworld, and we are proud to belong to the region that \r\nenshrined the world’s first nuclear-weapon-free zone \r\nunder the Treaty of Tlatelolco.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago believes firmly that the use \r\nor threat of use of nuclear weapons constitutes a crime \r\nagainst humanity and a violation of international law, \r\nincluding international humanitarian law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. We lament the fact that, \r\n46 years after the entry into force of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, the international \r\ncommunity is still unable to undertake good-faith \r\nnegotiations on nuclear disarmament. Mutually assured \r\ndestruction, which is inevitable with the use of nuclear \r\nweapons, cannot be a way of settling disputes when \r\nboth the combatants and several hundred millions \r\nof people outside the theatre of war would assuredly \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n26/53 16-29823\r\nperish. Trinidad and Tobago therefore continues to \r\nfirmly support the call for taking effective measures \r\non nuclear disarmament, including commencing \r\nnegotiations on an international instrument for \r\nprohibiting and eliminating nuclear weapons.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is deeply concerned about the \r\ngrowing number of violent extremist acts across the \r\nworld and the threat that they pose to our shared values \r\nof democracy, peace, tolerance and respect for human \r\ndignity. While it is important to deal with violent \r\nextremism from a security perspective, we should not \r\noverlook or dismiss the correlation between violent \r\nextremism and development. We remain concerned \r\nabout the global trend whereby young people fall victim \r\nto recruitment by extremist groups, through both online \r\nrecruitment and other forms of proselytization. To \r\naddress the problem, we share the view that in order to \r\nbe as effective as possible, counter-terrorism strategies \r\nshould include the creation of enabling environments \r\nthat support the empowerment of young people. \r\nThat inclusive approach can help to involve them in \r\nadvocating for the goals of our collective aspirations, \r\nthereby reducing the allure of extremist groups.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is committed to building an \r\neffective global framework for a strategic collective \r\nsecurity architecture that addresses the negative social, \r\neconomic and psychological conditions that give rise \r\nto violent extremism, including poverty, violations of \r\nhuman rights and weak governance. That framework \r\nmust also be supported by a robust international legal \r\nsystem that enables everyone to live freely and in \r\ndignity, without fear of persecution, and that affords \r\neveryone equal protection before the law, in word and \r\nin fact. A robust framework of international law can \r\nprotect all individuals from acts of violence, war crimes, \r\ncrimes of genocide and crimes against humanity.\r\nAs a country that was in the vanguard of the \r\nefforts to establish the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC), through the pioneering work of the late Arthur \r\nRobinson, former Prime Minister and President of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, Trinidad and Tobago remains \r\nresolute in its commitment to supporting the mandate \r\nof the ICC and its primary objective — helping to put \r\nan end to impunity for perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community and \r\nhelping to prevent such heinous crimes. Trinidad and \r\nTobago recognizes the importance and legitimacy of the \r\nICC in promoting the rule of law, encouraging respect \r\nfor human rights and achieving sustainable peace and \r\nthe further development of nations, in accordance with \r\ninternational law and the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. For those reasons, we \r\nurge those countries that have not yet submitted to the \r\njurisdiction of the Court to do so sooner rather than \r\nlater, so that it can appropriately and completely fulfil \r\nits mandate as a universal court.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is located in a region that \r\nis highly vulnerable to the current unprecedented \r\nrate of loss of marine biodiversity and the impact of \r\nunsustainable practices on the marine environment, \r\nparticularly in relation to activities conducted in marine \r\necosystems beyond areas of national jurisdiction. As \r\nsuch, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago looks \r\nforward to the adoption, under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), of an \r\ninternational legally binding instrument on the issue of \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction. We are of the view \r\nthat a new implementing agreement under UNCLOS \r\nshould lay a foundation for achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the protection and sustainable \r\nmanagement of the common heritage of humankind for \r\nthe benefit of present and future generations.\r\nOn the occasion of the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda last year (see A/70/PV.4), Trinidad and Tobago \r\nstated that one of the cornerstones of the integrated \r\nsustainable development agenda is the development of \r\na multilateral system strategically poised to facilitate \r\nthe implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals through multi-stakeholder partnerships. \r\nPartnerships undertaken by Governments, international \r\norganizations, civil society, the private sector and others \r\nprovide a vehicle for mobilizing and sharing knowledge, \r\nexpertise, financial resources and technology in order \r\nto support the efforts of developing countries to realize \r\nsustainable development.\r\nHowever, middle-income developing countries \r\ncontinue to grapple with a situation that renders them \r\nineligible for international development assistance \r\nby virtue of their status, while also coping with the \r\nvulnerabilities of being a small island developing State. \r\nThat is indeed a problem when we consider that our \r\ncountry’s middle-income status, based solely on per \r\ncapita income, denies Trinidad and Tobago access \r\nto international development assistance that could \r\nbolster our efforts to accelerate our sustainable and \r\nsocial development. That is the common experience \r\nof the Caribbean Community, and indeed of the \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 27/53\r\nmajority of SIDS. We firmly believe that the United \r\nNations development system should be driven by a \r\nmultidimensional approach to development assistance \r\nthat is better tailored to national priorities and \r\nspecific needs.\r\nIf the States Members of the United Nations firmly \r\nbelieve that there can be no sustainable development \r\nwithout peace — and if we all have intentions to keep \r\nour promise that no one will be left behind — then the \r\ninternational community must find a solution to the \r\nprotracted conflicts, tensions and humanitarian crises \r\noccurring across the world.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago continues to be deeply \r\nconcerned about the lack of credible progress in the \r\nIsrael-Palestine conflict. Recognizing the rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people as well as those of Israel, our \r\nGovernment has consistently expressed its support for \r\na negotiated settlement involving a two-State solution.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago is also concerned about the \r\nongoing border dispute between Guyana and Venezuela. \r\nGiven that the two countries have historically maintained \r\na friendly and cooperative relationship, we believe that \r\nthey should both engage constructively in working \r\ntowards a peaceful settlement, in accordance with the \r\nprinciples and purposes of the United Nations Charter.\r\nThe international community is pleased that the \r\nnormalization of relations between the United States \r\nand Cuba is making progress. The memory of the first \r\nhistorical visit by a sitting United States President to \r\nHavana since the 1959 Cuban revolution will remain \r\nin the minds of the people of Cuba and the world for \r\ngenerations, and Trinidad and Tobago continues to be \r\noptimistic that the growing relationship between both \r\ncountries will continue in good faith, and that the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\non Cuba, which significantly challenges its ability to \r\nachieve sustainable development, will be lifted soon.\r\nSince the adoption of the 2005 World Summit \r\nOutcome (resolution 60/1), not much has been done to \r\nmove the process of reforming the Security Council \r\nforward. Trinidad and Tobago remains concerned \r\nabout the fact that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform have seen little progress \r\nsince 2008. We therefore urge all Member States to \r\nwork collaboratively, in the spirit of compromise and \r\nfor the benefit of all States, to achieve reform of the \r\nSecurity Council so as to enable it to better address \r\ncurrent realities, thereby improving the functioning \r\nand effectiveness of the United Nations.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago, I wish to express our deepest \r\nappreciation to His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwhose term as the eighth Secretary-General comes to \r\na close at the end of this year. Mr. Ban has initiated \r\nmany sweeping changes and reforms at the Secretariat \r\ndesigned to make the Organization an ever more \r\ndynamic body capable of responding to the emerging \r\nneeds and challenges facing its diverse membership. \r\nAt a time of escalating international terrorism and \r\nthe increasingly urgent need for decisive action on \r\nclimate change, as well as of criticisms of the efficacy \r\nof the United Nations and its peacekeeping operations, \r\nhis outstanding efforts and leadership have been \r\ninstrumental in shaping the future of multilateralism. \r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Paris Agreement are just two \r\nexamples of an exceptional record of achievements, \r\nnot to mention his groundbreaking initiative earlier \r\nthis year to convene the first ever World Humanitarian \r\nSummit, in collaboration with the Government of \r\nTurkey, in the beautiful city of Istanbul.\r\nMr. Rahming (Bahamas), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAs the United Nations continues its search for \r\na successor, Trinidad and Tobago is of the view that \r\nthe next Secretary-General must be held to the highest \r\npossible standards of efficiency, competence and \r\nintegrity, with proven leadership and diplomatic skills. \r\nIt is the responsibility of the next Secretary-General to \r\nhelp realize the extraordinary expectations embodied \r\nin the Sustainable Development Goals, to address \r\nthe burgeoning challenges of the forced migration of \r\nrefugees and violent extremism, and to transform the \r\nUnited Nations into a global institution that is effective, \r\nrelevant and fit for purpose.\r\nThe universal push to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and transform our world is the \r\nresponsibility of every State Member of the United \r\nNations. In that regard, Trinidad and Tobago reaffirms \r\nits commitment to the Charter and its principles. We \r\nwill continue to work closely with our family of nations \r\nin the pursuit of international peace and security, \r\nhuman rights and sustainable development for every \r\nsingle human being. While we may look different, \r\nspeak different languages and face different challenges, \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n28/53 16-29823\r\nhumankind shares a common beginning and a common \r\nfuture. In the words of former Secretary-General Kofi \r\nAnnan,\r\n“beneath the surface of States and nations, ideas \r\nand language, lies the fate of individual human \r\nbeings in need. Answering their needs will be \r\nthe mission of the United Nations in the century \r\nto come”.\r\nTogether, let our answer resonate for generations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Augustine Philip Mahiga, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, East Africa, Regional and International \r\nCooperation of the United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): First \r\nand foremost, I would like to convey to the Assembly \r\ngreetings from Mr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, \r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania, who, \r\nowing to pressing engagements at home, including \r\ndealing with the aftermath of the recent devastating \r\nearthquake in north-western Tanzania, could not attend \r\ntoday’s meeting. He reaffirms Tanzania’s commitment \r\nto the United Nations and its ideals, and wishes the \r\nAssembly success in its deliberations.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government \r\nof the United Republic of Tanzania, I would like to \r\ncongratulate the President on his election to lead the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session. My \r\ndelegation wishes him and his team a successful tenure \r\nas they preside over our collective global agenda. \r\nTanzania pledges its support and cooperation to him in \r\ndischarging his duties and responsibilities. We would \r\nalso like to commend his predecessor, Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, President of the Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession, for his tireless efforts in sustaining momentum \r\nfor the implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs).\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly of Tanzania’s \r\ncontinued support to our shared commitment to \r\naddressing the myriad challenges facing the world, \r\nincluding, but not limited to, poverty, injustice, climate \r\nchange and violent extremism. The United Republic of \r\nTanzania is counting on the leadership of the President \r\nin mobilizing the world to implement the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. Now that the framework \r\nfor the global indicators is in place, the onus is on us \r\nto ensure effective implementation of the Agenda. We \r\nwelcome the theme that the Member States adopted \r\nfor this session of the Assembly — “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”. We recognize that it is an ambitious agenda \r\nand that much is at stake. We know that national \r\nefforts must be stepped up if we are to make the \r\nAgenda implementable.\r\nWe in Tanzania have integrated the SDGs into \r\nour national development plans and strategies, and \r\nin collaboration with a broad range of stakeholders, \r\nwe have taken various steps to ensure effective \r\nimplementation at the national level. Our second \r\nnational five-year development plan, launched in \r\nJune, whose theme is “Nurturing industrialization for \r\neconomic transformation and human development”, as \r\nwell as our new 2016-2020 poverty reduction strategy \r\nfor Zanzibar, are informed by the outcomes of both \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nthe African Union’s Agenda 2063. They are the basic \r\nframeworks in our efforts to improve the welfare of \r\nTanzanians and ensure that no one is left behind.\r\nIn spite of our national efforts, and a significant \r\ndrive to mobilize domestic resources for implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063, we have learned that \r\non our own we cannot realize those ambitious goals in a \r\ntimely manner. Individual and collective efforts at the \r\nlocal, national and international levels are imperative. \r\nWe have an international and regional obligation to \r\ndischarge our commitments in keeping with Goal \r\n17 of the SDGs, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda on \r\nfinancing for development and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change.\r\nGender equality and women’s empowerment, \r\nas fundamental human rights, have now become an \r\nacceptable and enduring theme in humankind’s pursuit \r\nof equality and justice, a scale for measuring social \r\nprogress and an important goal in realizing sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Women’s political and economic \r\nparticipation in leadership roles and decision-making \r\nstrengthens democracy and equality and gives vigour \r\nto the economy. That is the essence of Goal 5.\r\nMoreover, while women’s empowerment and \r\nfull participation in society are important goals \r\nin themselves, they are vital to reducing poverty, \r\nachieving universal education, improving maternal \r\nand child health and fulfilling other development \r\ngoals. Economic development is also a strategic tool \r\nfor expanding women’s political participation and \r\nleadership. Without a capacity to generate their own \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 29/53\r\nincomes, women face considerable barriers to reaching \r\nhigher levels of education and obtaining health care \r\nand the autonomy needed to participate in politics. \r\nCollectively and universally, they represent more than \r\nhalf of the human resources and potential skills and \r\ntalents available to humankind in our societies.\r\nTanzania is committed to promoting women’s \r\nempowerment at all levels. We are striving to bring \r\nmore women into the formal sector through capacity-\r\nbuilding programmes and advocacy. We have removed \r\ndiscriminatory laws and policies with the aim of \r\nempowering women, including by reforming our land \r\nlaws to entitle all to inheritance and equal access \r\nto land. Tanzania has continued to act to improve \r\nwomen’s representation in decision-making bodies. \r\nThe 2010 general elections saw 126 women elected, and \r\nby 2015 that number had increased to 142, amounting \r\nto 36.9 per cent of all parliamentarians in the country. It \r\nwas during the 2015 elections that President Magufuli \r\nchose the first-ever female Vice-President of the \r\nUnited Republic of Tanzania, who also happens to be \r\nthe person participating in the United Nations initiative \r\nfor the empowerment of women. That reaffirms \r\nmy country’s determination to see more women \r\nin key decision-making positions and to continue \r\nscaling up such initiatives to empower women in \r\nTanzania. The process is also increasingly owned by \r\nwomen themselves.\r\nGoal 16 of the SDGs recognizes that corruption \r\nundermines efforts to combat poverty and gender \r\ninequality. It denies access and acts as a tax on \r\npoor families in their access to their rights to public \r\nservices. That is why the Government of Tanzania \r\nhas waged a war on corruption by mainstreaming \r\ntransparency, accountability and effectiveness in the \r\ndelivery of services by public institutions. We have \r\ninstituted mechanisms to promote ethical standards and \r\nensure that those holding public office recognize that \r\ntheir primary responsibility is to provide quality and \r\ntimely service to the public. We have complemented \r\nthose efforts by enhancing public awareness of the \r\nevils of corruption. But national efforts to curb \r\ncorruption cannot yield sustainable results without \r\nsupport from the international community. Developed \r\ncountries must hold their investors and multinational \r\ncompanies accountable by ensuring that they pay the \r\ntaxes they owe. In order to contribute to financing our \r\ndevelopment, they must also be ready to return the \r\nassets and funds that some unscrupulous leaders and \r\nindividuals steal from developing countries and hide in \r\noverseas accounts.\r\nWe all know that young people are very important \r\nto a nation’s development. They are not only the leaders \r\nof tomorrow, they are also the partners of today. \r\nIgnoring them can lead to catastrophe, as they are \r\neasily lured into harmful activities that are detrimental \r\nto society, such as drug trafficking and joining radical \r\nextremist groups and terrorist cells. Since young people \r\nform a large percentage of our population, we are \r\ntaking measures to empower that crucial group, which \r\nwe believe will champion our efforts to implement the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. To that end, \r\nwe have established a youth development fund that by \r\nMarch of this year had already lent a total of 1.6 billion \r\nTanzanian shillings to 284 youth groups. We therefore \r\ncall on our development partners to complement our \r\nefforts in the same cause.\r\nOne of the priorities of the Government of Tanzania \r\nis achieving inclusive and quality education for all. We \r\nbelieve that education is one of the most powerful and \r\nproven vehicles for attaining sustainable development, \r\nand we are working tirelessly to ensure that all girls and \r\nboys receive a free primary and secondary education. \r\nThe Government has reformed its curriculum to \r\nimprove its provision of a quality education capable \r\nof addressing the needs of the twenty-first century. \r\nIn addition, we are directing our education policy \r\nand strategy in order to reach specific vulnerable and \r\nmarginalized populations, including girls, women and \r\nthose with disabilities.\r\nWhen he took office, President Magafuli made \r\nprimary and secondary education free for all children. \r\nThe Government has set aside more than 263 billion \r\nTanzanian shillings to cover the full cost of guaranteeing \r\nfree primary and secondary education for all, thereby \r\ndemonstrating its commitment to providing free, quality \r\neducation to the people. The objective is to ensure that \r\nwe meet target 4.1 of Sustainable Development Goal \r\n4, which requires States to ensure that “all girls and \r\nboys complete free, equitable and quality primary and \r\nsecondary education”.\r\nClimate change is poised to undermine national \r\nefforts to reduce poverty. The losses of human, natural, \r\nfinancial, social and physical capital caused by the \r\nadverse effects of climate change are of great concern to \r\nTanzania as it strives to attain sustainable development. \r\nThat is why we have made climate-change adaptation a \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n30/53 16-29823\r\nnational priority. Based on the effects of climate change, \r\nwe have prepared a national adaptation programme of \r\naction and subsequent national adaptation plans for \r\nTanzania, aimed at identifying immediate and long-\r\nterm actions for addressing climate change through our \r\nnational climate-change strategy.\r\nIt is our hope that the Green Climate Fund and other \r\nfunds will provide the financial resources needed to \r\naddress adaptation requirements, as their unavailability \r\nlimits the delivery of national obligations. Our \r\nmodest estimates show that we need approximately \r\n$500 million annually to address the already vivid \r\nimpacts of climate change. It is therefore important \r\nfor the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change to enhance efforts to address barriers \r\nto financial resources from such funds. That will allow \r\ndeveloping countries, particularly those that are least \r\ndeveloped, to access the necessary resources urgently \r\nand without conditionality.\r\nThe adoption of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange was truly historic. At the time of ratifying \r\nthe Agreement, Tanzania submitted its intended \r\nnationally determined contributions (INDCs) on both \r\nadaptation and mitigation under the Paris Agreement, \r\nand was among the first countries to do so. That \r\nwas a demonstration of our firm commitment to \r\nfulfilling our obligations on the protection of the \r\nplanet and humankind in general. Our INDCs cover \r\nboth adaptation and mitigation in the context of our \r\nnational development vision. With over 48 million \r\nhectares of forested land, which is more than 54 per \r\ncent of our land mass, Tanzania is already making a \r\ngreat contribution to the global community in terms of \r\ncarbon sink. However, it concerns us that our nationally \r\ndetermined contributions as a global community are \r\nnot adding up to the collective numbers that will make \r\nthe world safe for humankind. Those countries with \r\nmore responsibility and capacity must take the lead \r\nby reducing their emissions, since otherwise the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change will have very limited \r\neffect, if any at all.\r\nTanzania has not been spared by the world drug \r\nproblem. Illicit drugs trafficked from other regions \r\nare crossing our borders, and some of them remain in \r\nour communities. During his inaugural speech at the \r\ncurrent session of Parliament, my President made a \r\nstrong commitment to fighting illicit drug dealers and \r\ntraffickers. In addressing the issue of international \r\ncriminality, bringing major dealers to justice will \r\nbe among the priorities on his agenda. In the clear \r\nknowledge that corruption is a barrier to fighting \r\nthis menace, we are determined to tackle both evils \r\nconcurrently. Our resolve will remain unshaken, and \r\nthe Government will continue to strengthen control \r\nover the trade in and use of drugs. We need international \r\ncooperation in fighting these international crimes.\r\nThe horrific terrorist attacks in 1998 on the \r\nAmerican Embassy in Dar-es-Salaam is a tragedy our \r\npeople cannot forget. The increasing speed with which \r\nattacks by terrorists and other radical groups have \r\nspread around the world has caused the loss of life of \r\nthousands of innocent people and the destruction of \r\nproperty. Such acts continue to undermine national, \r\nregional and global efforts to reduce poverty and achieve \r\nsustainable development. Tanzania is cooperating with \r\nthe international community to address this global \r\nthreat and has taken several practical steps, including \r\nenacting the Prevention of Terrorism Act of 2002, \r\nthe Prevention of Terrorism Regulations of 2014, the \r\nMoney Laundering Act of 2006 and the Amendment \r\nto Money Laundering Regulations of 2013. A Financial \r\nIntelligence Unit in the Ministry of Finance has also \r\nbeen put in place to combat the financing of terrorism. \r\nFurthermore, the Government has established a \r\nnational counter-terrorism strategy, which coordinates \r\nthe counter-terrorism efforts of our agencies. It is \r\nbecoming increasingly evident that Tanzania, and East \r\nAfrica as a whole, form part of the global terrorist \r\nagenda and strategy.\r\nWhile strengthening our legal framework and \r\ncapacities to confront this menace, we continue to \r\nenhance international cooperation in dealing with \r\nterrorism. If we do not take stern measures now, we \r\nrisk denying our achievement of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. International terrorism has \r\na grand strategy that intends to envelop and shackle \r\nnot only East Africa but West Africa and North Africa \r\ntoo, before marching towards Southern Africa. This is \r\na serious threat that must be collectively acknowledged \r\nand tackled by the international community.\r\nOn the subject of regional conflicts in Africa, \r\nTanzania is concerned about the ongoing conflict in \r\nBurundi and its impact, including loss of life, damage \r\nto property and the displacement of persons. Tanazania \r\nhas been one of the host countries for the refugees that \r\nf lee Burundi sporadically. It is currently hosting more \r\nthan 165 Burundian refugees who left because of the \r\nmost recent conflict.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 31/53\r\nThe East African Community member States \r\nare working hard to ensure the return of peace to \r\nBurundi. We believe that, under the able leadership \r\nof His Excellency Mr. Kaguta Yoweri Museveni, \r\nPresident of Uganda, as a mediator and His Excellency \r\nMr. Benjamin William Mkapa, former President of \r\nTanzania, as a facilitator, the peace process, which is \r\nnow back on track, will regain its former vigour so that \r\nit becomes as inclusive as possible and succeeds sooner \r\nrather than later.\r\nTanzania joins the international community in \r\ncondemning the recent resumption of conflict in \r\nSouth Sudan. The situation has derailed the progress \r\nwe had made towards settlement of the conflict and \r\nthe reunification of the Sudan People’s Liberation \r\nMovement, in which Tanzania and South Africa played \r\na significant role. We call upon the parties to the conflict \r\nin South Sudan to continue working together in the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD)-\r\nled efforts to bring about peace. We hope the positive \r\neffects of the August 2015 IGAD peace agreement will \r\ncontinue to prevail and enable the peace process to \r\nmove forward swiftly and successfully.\r\nAs the current Chair of the East African Community, \r\nTanzania convened an Extraordinary Summit earlier \r\nthis month to address the ongoing political impasse \r\nand security crises in both Burundi and South Sudan. \r\nIt is my hope that both countries will put their national \r\ninterests, particularly those of their people, first and end \r\nthe conflicts. We invite the international community to \r\ntake an interest in these issues, while leaving leadership \r\nto the East African Community. These conflicts must \r\ncontinue to be of concern not only to Africa but to the \r\nrest of the world, as they impact upon international \r\npeace and security.\r\nThe Security Council and the General Assembly \r\nhave adopted numerous resolutions on Palestine and \r\nWestern Sahara that demand attention and action. \r\nThe non-implementation of these decisions erodes the \r\ncredibility of the Organization. As States Members of \r\nthe United Nations, we must ensure that we put into \r\npractice that which we deliberate and agree upon.\r\nUnilateral sanctions and embargoes imposed on \r\ncountries are a hindrance to development and affect \r\ninnocent civilians. While we welcome the resumption \r\nof bilateral relations between the United States and \r\nCuba, we continue to reiterate our position in favour of \r\nthe total elimination of embargoes for the betterment \r\nof the peoples of both countries. The early lifting of \r\nsanctions and embargoes will strengthen relations for \r\nthe mutual benefit of both parties, the United States \r\nand Cuba.\r\nWe are currently witnessing a new process for \r\nselecting the next Secretary-General. We welcome \r\nthe hearings of the General Assembly on all aspirants. \r\nThe process has shown that it is possible for the new \r\nSecretary-General to be selected transparently and \r\ndemocratically by all Member States. Furthermore, my \r\ndelegation is of the view that the Security Council should \r\nsubmit more than one name to the General Assembly \r\nfor voting. In addition, Tanzania wishes to reaffirm \r\nthe decision of the African Union Summit during its \r\ntwenty-seventh ordinary session, held in July, that the \r\nselection of the Secretary-General should respect the \r\nprinciple of geographical rotation and take into account \r\ngender balance. The selection of the Secretary-General \r\nin 2016 will send a clear signal that the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council are also ready \r\nand willing to embark upon a reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. That process will enhance the credibility of \r\nthe United Nations and begin the long-overdue reforms \r\nof the Security Council and the General Assembly.\r\nIn conclusion, Tanzania wishes to pay particular \r\ntribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and his \r\nteam, who will be ending their tenure at the end of \r\n2016. Under the stewardship of Mr. Ban Ki-moon, who \r\nled the Organization by example, we have been able \r\nto address in all honesty global issues ranging from \r\nclimate change to development and peace and security. \r\nIf other issues have lagged behind, he has at least put \r\nthem on the agenda of the United Nations. We look \r\nforward to the new Secretary-General picking up where \r\nBan Ki-moon leaves off.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Valentin Rybakov, Deputy Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Belarus.\r\nMr. Rybakov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): A year \r\nago, world leaders gave the green light to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. The document is \r\nnow our common guide for the next 15 years. In the \r\nhistory of the Organization, there have been similar \r\ngrand initiatives. Unfortunately, some of them have \r\nremained confined to paper, such as the idea 40 years \r\nago of establishing a new world economic order. I very \r\nmuch hope that a similar fate does not befall the current \r\nAgenda. Yet such fears do exist. The main problem is \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n32/53 16-29823\r\nthat the world lacks systemic stability, which means \r\nthat there is no confidence in what will come tomorrow, \r\nand there is no confidence that the world is evolving \r\nin accordance with rational order and common sense. \r\nWars, conflicts and increasing transnational challenges \r\ngive rise to a feeling of chaos, a chaos that exists side \r\nby side with unprecedented interconnectedness and \r\nscientific and technological progress. In other words, \r\nwe are living in conditions of contradictory realities.\r\n How has chaos become a serious contender with \r\npositive a globalization progress? I think there are three \r\nanswers to that question — political, economic and \r\nsocial. From a political point of view, problems have \r\narisen because the so-called winners of the Cold War \r\ndid not want to integrate the losers into their system. \r\nFurthermore, as was the case with the First World War, \r\nthe victors tried to impose their will on the vanquished \r\nand to unilaterally carry out sweeping global changes \r\nthat affected everyone, not just themselves. That \r\nattempt was unsuccessful. It could not have been \r\notherwise. It is probably true that history does teach us \r\nsomething here. The consequences of that attempt were \r\nterrible — the destruction of States, festering conflicts, \r\nmega-terrorism, large movements of people in the form \r\nof migration. As a result, in terms of politics, the world \r\nis now in a period of transition. However, we do not \r\nknow what we are moving towards.\r\nWe must also consider the economic factor. In that \r\ncontext, there has always been a conflict between the \r\nState and the market — at least since the time of the \r\nIndustrial Revolution. Balanced and healthy competition \r\nis unquestionably useful for economic progress and \r\nreducing poverty and inequality. However, in recent \r\ndecades the balance has been disturbed. The market has \r\ngained the upper hand and the State has been relegated \r\nto second place. That has happened because it was the \r\nobjective pursued by so-called corporate capital, which \r\nhas dominated life in leading developed countries. And \r\nwhat has that free market given us? The minority — the \r\ntrue advocate of corporate capital — has achieved even \r\ngreater wealth. For everybody else corporate capital \r\nhas meant nothing but suffering and problems.\r\nIt is also important that the market has seriously \r\nexacerbated the environmental challenges that the \r\nworld faces. The market is not concerned with anything \r\nexcept profit. What does the market care about the \r\nenvironment?\r\nProblems of a social nature are probably not \r\nso obvious to the general public. At the same time, \r\nthey are no less serious and no less dangerous than \r\nthe challenges we face in the political and economic \r\nspheres. We are seeing growing social and cultural gaps \r\nin the world, and problems of identity loom large. As \r\na result we are spending more and more time arguing \r\nabout essentially spiritual matters. Without question, \r\nthere are understandable reasons for the advent of a \r\ncounterculture in various countries half a century ago. \r\nThere is also an explanation for how that phenomenon \r\nhas changed social relations in the West, particularly \r\nin the areas of morals, moral values and the family. \r\nHowever, there is something that makes no sense and \r\nthat is why such changes should affect the rest of the \r\nworld. Why should those who have accepted the changes \r\nimpose them on others whose historical contexts were \r\ndifferent and whose societies therefore had no reason to \r\nadopt similar changes?\r\nUnderstanding the reasons for the advent of an \r\nunstable world that is full of contradictions is certainly \r\nimportant. That is the first step towards action. \r\nTherefore, what do we have to do to change the negative \r\nglobal context? In political terms, we have to have a \r\nclear understanding of where we want to go from the \r\ncurrent period of transition. What is the new world \r\norder that we are endeavouring to create? Of course, \r\nthat is easier said than done. In that context, I cannot \r\nhelp but quote the outstanding thinker Immanuel Kant \r\nwho said that\r\n“building a just and peaceful international system \r\nis the most difficult of all tasks and a perfect \r\nsolution is impossible”.\r\nWe all have ideas about how to change the world, \r\nbut those ideas are different and we will all have to \r\nsacrifice something if we want to enact a change for \r\nthe better. The result will ref lect the lowest common \r\ndenominator, but that is inevitable. I am not going to try \r\nto predict what the reality of this new world order will \r\nbe in terms of its form and content. I would just like \r\nto focus attention on three principles that we think are \r\nessential to building that world order.\r\nFirst, the new system should be State-driven. \r\nStates remain, as they have been, the main players in \r\ninternational life. Where States are non-existent or \r\nweak, anarchy, chaos and violence reign. Secondly, the \r\nnew world order should be inclusive. That means that all \r\nStates, without exception, should have a voice — a real \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 33/53\r\nvoice, not just one for the sake of appearances. Thirdly, \r\nI am deeply convinced that the new system cannot be \r\nimposed; it needs to be cultivated. Only then would it be \r\nconsidered fair by both politicians and ordinary people.\r\nIn terms of the economy, we have been seeing \r\npositive trends, notably in connection with the \r\nre-establishment of a balance between the State and the \r\nmarket. The financial and economic crisis of the past \r\ndecade demonstrated the failure of free-market ideas. \r\nAs a result, around the world we have been seeing \r\nthe re-establishment and strengthening of the State \r\nrole in economic affairs. It is important for that trend \r\nto continue. Belarus has in the past consistently been \r\ncommitted to the idea of a strong State, especially in \r\neconomic matters, and we plan to continue that policy \r\nin the future. It is the will of the Belarusian people, \r\nwhich was clearly expressed in June at the Belarusian \r\nPeople’s Assembly.\r\nIn the context of economics, another important trend \r\nis towards regional integration. To some extent, regional \r\nblocs have begun to play an independent role — one \r\nwhich until recently had been the prerogative of States. \r\nSince that seems to be the trend, there is a pressing \r\nneed to establish cooperation mechanisms for regional \r\nprocesses similar to those we have established for States. \r\nBelarus holds that theme very close to heart. Belarus, as \r\nan active participant in a number of regional integration \r\nprocesses, remains very committed thereto. We have a \r\nvested interest in strengthening those processes and are \r\ndeeply convinced that cooperation with other regional \r\ninitiatives will facilitate that task. Our approach could \r\nbe summed up as “integrating integration”. To assist \r\nin implementing that concept, we shall soon convene a \r\nconference on this issue in Minsk, with the support of \r\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Europe.\r\nFinally, on the need for action in social and \r\ncultural areas, let us begin with a very simple fact. \r\nWe are all different as a result of a host of different \r\nfactors — geography, climate, wars, epidemics, religions \r\nand many others. Those factors have made us who we \r\nare. Tradition and culture cannot be changed. They \r\nhave the power to unite. In a given territory they unite \r\nthe people who died there, the people who are living \r\nthere now and the people who have not yet been born. \r\nIt is therefore obvious that imposing our preferences on \r\neach other is a mistaken and pointless endeavour.\r\nWhat we need in this situation is dialogue, both \r\ndialogue to understand one another and dialogue that \r\nis a goal in itself. Dialogue should be an ongoing \r\nprocess that helps to find common ground among the \r\ndifferent social and cultural approaches and that yields \r\na positive result.\r\nLet us consider the concept of the family as an \r\nexample. We in Belarus are committed to the values \r\nof a traditional family, while in other countries there \r\nmay be a recognition of a variety of types of family. \r\nWe think that the individual is part of a family. Others, \r\nhowever, may assume that the family belongs to the \r\nindividual. We do not need to demonstrate to each other \r\nthe rightness of our particular approach. Instead, we \r\nshould understand why we hold different positions. Can \r\nour different approaches lead to some kind of positive \r\nresult? I think they can.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus sees an opportunity for \r\naddressing such approaches at the meeting of the United \r\nNations Commission on Narcotic Drugs scheduled \r\nfor March 2017, at which a draft resolution will be \r\nproposed on the role of the family in preventing illicit \r\ndrug trafficking. We all have an interest in an effective \r\nfight against that challenge. We need to think together \r\nabout how the family may be able to help in that area, \r\ndespite the fact that we may understand the concept of \r\nfamily differently.\r\nIf Member States really want to achieve the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, they need to \r\nrestore world stability and overcome the growing \r\nchaos. I am convinced that this is possible, and that the \r\nUnited Nations, with its wealth of expertise, has the \r\npotential to help States in that endeavour. In any case, \r\nit is important that the United Nations work on practical \r\nimplementation of the Agenda rather than immerse \r\nitself in the usual optimization, synchronization and \r\nreport-writing. It is important to recognize that the \r\nSecretariat has not always worked in harmony with \r\nMember States. We hope that situation will change for \r\nthe better under the new Head of our Organization.\r\nThe new Agenda for the United Nations, like the \r\ncurrent global context, poses significant challenges for \r\nus. Looking at the prospects for their implementation, I \r\ncall on everyone to be guided by the words of the second \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Dag Hammarskjöld, who said,\r\n“Never measure the height of a mountain until you \r\nhave reached the top. Then you will see how low it \r\nwas.”\r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n34/53 16-29823\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Caleb Otto, chair of the delegation of the Republic \r\nof Palau.\r\nMr. Otto (Palau): On behalf of His Excellency \r\nMr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., the President of \r\nthe Republic of Palau, I have the honour to make the \r\nfollowing remarks at the seventy-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAt the outset, Palau would like to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his election to lead \r\nour work at the seventy-first session. We are confident \r\nthat he will rise to the many challenges and make the \r\nPacific islands proud. We pledge him our support. We \r\nalso wish to take this opportunity to express our sincere \r\ngratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his sterling \r\nleadership during the past year. His presidency will be \r\nknown for championing participation and transparency.\r\nWe join other Pacific nations in extending our \r\nheartiest congratulations to Fiji on bringing home to \r\nthe Pacific islands from Rio de Janeiro the first-ever \r\nOlympic gold medal. We would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to commend and thank the people of Brazil \r\nfor successfully hosting the thirty-first Olympiad. Palau \r\nbelieves in the power of sport as an important enabler \r\nof sustainable development, and we contributed to the \r\nidea of sport being included in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, as expressed in paragraph \r\n37 of that document. The power of sport to uplift the \r\nhuman spirit was demonstrated when a team composed \r\nof refugees was allowed to compete in the Olympic \r\nGames in Rio. We congratulate the refugee team, Brazil \r\nand sport for walking the talk about inclusiveness.\r\nA year ago, as we began our address to the General \r\nAssembly (see A/70/PV.28), we stated that we lived in \r\nperilously challenging yet still hopeful times. As we \r\nmeet today, the perils of climate change and global \r\nconflicts still exist. Other challenges, such as those \r\nposed by the f low of migrants and refugees, as well as \r\nby terrorism and violent extremism, have become more \r\nprominent, bringing with them psychosocial damage \r\nand despair. Addressing antimicrobial resistance \r\nand nuclear testing issues have also become matters \r\nof urgency.\r\nAmid those challenges we still have bases for \r\nholding onto hope. The high-level plenary meeting on \r\naddressing large movements of refugees and migrants, \r\nheld recently, gave us an opportunity to explore ways to \r\naddress the issue, and we eagerly await the report from \r\nthat meeting.\r\nWe commend Ambassador Gómez Camacho of \r\nMexico for his excellent work on the Political Declaration \r\nof the high-level meeting of the General Assembly on \r\nantimicrobial resistance (resolution 71/3). We trust that \r\nthe Declaration will galvanize much-needed action \r\nthroughout United Nations agencies and on the ground \r\nin all States Members of the United Nations.\r\nPalau joins the family of nations condemning the \r\nnuclear testing conducted by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. We are concerned with the peace and \r\nlong-term stability of the Pacific region. The proximity \r\nof Palau to the launching site places us at particular \r\nrisk. In addition, we call on Member States that have \r\nnot yet ratified the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons to do so in order for us to move one \r\nstep closer to total nuclear disarmament.\r\nThe impact of climate change in terms of sea-\r\nlevel rise, ocean acidification and the frequency and \r\nintensity of storms continues to pose an existential \r\nthreat to Palau and other small island developing \r\nStates. Palau participated actively in the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change processes \r\nand was one of the countries that strongly advocated for \r\nmaking Goal 13 of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) a stand-alone goal on climate change. Palau is \r\nproud to have been the second, following Fiji, of the 60 \r\nnations to have ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, bringing the total number of ratifications \r\nto approximately 48 per cent of the membership, \r\nwith 55 per cent of Member States required for the \r\nAgreement to enter into force. We are encouraged by \r\nthe 130 nations that have signed the Agreement and are \r\nconfident that by end of the year the Agreement will \r\nbegin to work for all of us.\r\nIn addition, we are hopeful that a Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General for climate \r\nchange and security will be appointed. Such an \r\nappointment will provide an effective working link \r\nbetween the Secretary-General, the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council on matters dealing with peace \r\nand security arising from climate change.\r\nIt is imperative that no effort be spared to ensure \r\nthat global temperature rise remains under 1.5°C. \r\nFurthermore, access to financial and technological \r\nresources must be made available to small island \r\ndeveloping States and all those who need it most.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 35/53\r\nFourteen years is a short period within which to \r\nachieve the 17 goals of 2030 Agenda, which is why \r\nwe agree with the sense of urgency expressed in the \r\nword “push” in the theme for the seventy-first session \r\nof the United Nations: “The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals: a universal push to transform our world”. There \r\nis an urgent need to transform our world in the face \r\nof severe climate change impacts, global conflicts \r\nresulting in the unprecedented migration of refugees \r\nand poverty exacerbated by huge gaps in resource use \r\nand ownership. There is a need to push — either to \r\njump-start or go further than we have gone already. A \r\npush is indeed necessary as we have already lost a year \r\nof implementation.\r\nIn Palau we are in the process of integrating the 17 \r\nGoals into our national and sectoral plans so that we \r\ncan implement the 2030 Agenda in a holistic manner. \r\nAs part of that effort, we have taken an initiative that \r\nfor us represents a concrete path towards achievement \r\nof the SDGs: the National Marine Sanctuary, which we \r\nbegan to implement in 2015.\r\nThe National Marine Sanctuary sets aside as a \r\nno-take zone 80 per cent of our total exclusive economic \r\nzone — an area of over half a million square kilometres \r\nof our ocean. The Palau National Marine Sanctuary \r\nis an initiative based on a traditional practice of \r\nconservation called Bul, which imposes a moratorium \r\non the exploitation of diminishing resources in order \r\nto allow them to replenish themselves. The National \r\nMarine Sanctuary will therefore allow our ocean to \r\nregain its health, replenish its fish stocks and make \r\nprogress in the rejuvenation of the biodiversity within it. \r\nBy strengthening the ocean-based activities of diving, \r\nsnorkeling, kayaking, swimming and catch-and-release \r\nsport fishing, the Sanctuary will boost Palau tourism, \r\nwhich is the main engine of our economy. More \r\nimportant, it will allow us to pass on a healthy ocean \r\nand its heritage to our children and the generations to \r\nfollow.\r\nIn addition to facilitating the achievement of \r\nGoals 13 and 14, the increased income from tourism \r\nwill allow us to provide basic services, such water and \r\nsanitation, and to ensure food security. It will allow us \r\nto address the other Goals, including the eradication of \r\nextreme poverty, the improvement of health, including \r\naddressing the predominance of non-communicable \r\ndiseases, the strengthening of education, building \r\nstronger community resilience and improved \r\ninformation and communication technology to facilitate \r\nstronger and more effective disaster resilience. We will \r\nalso be able to address the special needs of children, the \r\nelderly and persons with disabilities, including those \r\nwith mental illnesses. One of the important outcomes \r\nwe want from the 2030 Agenda is the promotion of the \r\nmental health and well-being for all citizens of Palau.\r\nThe success of the Palau National Marine \r\nSanctuary will depend to a great extent upon what \r\nhappens in the areas beyond national jurisdiction, \r\nsince fish stocks and the health of biodiversity do \r\nnot have specific boundaries. Palau is therefore \r\ngrateful that, in accordance with resolution 69/292, a \r\nnew implementing agreement is under consideration \r\nthrough Preparatory Committee negotiations designed \r\nto come up with a comprehensive global regime to \r\nbetter address the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nthe marine biological diversity in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction. We are hopeful that the two Preparatory \r\nCommittees will continue to make positive progress \r\ntowards a strong implementing agreement. It would \r\ncontribute greatly to the successful achievement of the \r\nobjectives of the Palau National Marine Sanctuary.\r\nGenuine and durable partnerships are also critical \r\nto the success of the Sanctuary initiative. Conducting \r\nthe monitoring and surveillance of such a vast area \r\nis very challenging when we are so constrained in \r\nour financial, technological and human resources. \r\nThis underpins the importance of Goal 17 and the \r\nsignificance of genuine and durable partnerships so \r\nstrongly advocated for in the Small Island Developing \r\nStates Accelerated Modalities of Action, also known \r\nas the Samoa Pathway. In that context, we also wish \r\nto recommend that all of us consider partnering with \r\nGod in our work: He is the only faithful, genuine and \r\ndurable partner.\r\nPalau has been fortunate to have many friends \r\nand development partners that have assisted us in our \r\nNational Marine Sanctuary initiative, our renewable \r\nenergy efforts and our sustainable development \r\nactivities. In that regard, we wish to acknowledge with \r\ngratitude the strong partnerships that we have enjoyed \r\nwith the United States of America, Japan, Australia, \r\nNew Zealand, the European Union, Italy, India and \r\nTaiwan. We are especially grateful for the assistance \r\nthey have already given us for the Marine Sanctuary, \r\non climate change and in other areas of development.\r\nThe Republic of China — Taiwan — provided \r\nassistance that helped us to achieve our Millennium \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n36/53 16-29823\r\nDevelopment Goals, and we look forward to continued \r\nsupport from it towards our achievement of the 2030 \r\nAgenda. We urge the United Nations system to involve \r\nTaiwan in the processes for implementing the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. We will need all \r\nthe resources we can garner, and it will require the \r\nparticipation of every global citizen to have the push \r\nwe need to be successful. The mantra “no one left \r\nbehind” must refer not only to benefits, but also to \r\nthe implementation of the 2030 Agenda. The Agenda \r\nwas universal in its development and is universal in its \r\ntransformational goals. It must also be universal in its \r\nimplementation. Finally, Taiwan possesses technical \r\ncapacity in many areas which can be shared with the \r\nworld. It should therefore participate in international \r\nmeetings, mechanisms and frameworks, such as \r\nthe World Health Organization, the International \r\nCivil Aviation Organization and various economic \r\npartnerships, inter alia.\r\nWhen we talk about participating in and benefiting \r\nfrom the 2030 Agenda, we think of enablers of \r\nachievement. Accordingly, in addition to applauding \r\nthe re-establishment of diplomatic relations between \r\nthe United States and Cuba, we would advocate for \r\nlifting the embargo so Cuba can have the resources it \r\nrequires to meet its developmental goals. In addition, \r\nwe join others in advocating for an amenable resolution \r\nto the problem in West Papua through meaningful and \r\nconstructive dialogue.\r\nMr. Bhattarai (Nepal), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would be remiss if I did not \r\nexpress, on behalf of Palau, our profound appreciation \r\nfor Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon. He is the first \r\nSecretary-General to visit the Pacific, and he never \r\nwavered in his desire to ensure that the existential \r\nthreats to the most vulnerable small island developing \r\nStates were addressed. Under his stewardship, among \r\nother things, we achieved the Paris Agreement, the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We wish \r\nhim and his family well in their future endeavours.\r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon often said,\r\n“We are the first generation that can end poverty \r\nand the last that can end climate change.”\r\nWe agree and salute him for the 2030 Agenda and Paris \r\nAgreement, which, if implemented effectively, will \r\nhelp end poverty and climate change, respectively. Our \r\nresolve to leave no one behind should be about those \r\nwho need help and about those who can offer help. \r\nAddressing climate change and achieving the 2030 \r\nAgenda requires political will, resolve, commitment of \r\nresources and goodwill. There is no room for political \r\nbarriers.\r\nI am reminded of what the Secretary-General \r\nsaid in his statement at the opening of the seventy-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly. On the topic of \r\nbarriers, he said,\r\n“Far too often, I have seen widely supported \r\nproposals blocked ... by a few or sometimes even \r\njust one country ... Time and again, I have seen \r\nessential action and good ideas blocked ...\r\n“Is it fair, in this complicated twenty-first century, \r\nfor any one country, or a few countries, to yield \r\nsuch disproportionate power and hold the world \r\nhostage on so many important issues?\r\n“The global public is right to ask whether this is \r\nhow an Organization in which we have invested \r\nso much hope and so many aspirations should \r\nfunction”. (A/71/PV.8, pp. 3-4).\r\nIn that vein, Palau supports Security Council reform, \r\nincluding expansion of the permanent membership \r\nto include two seats for Africa and one seat for small \r\nisland developing States. Our generation will either rise \r\nto meet the challenges or be condemned to face regrets \r\nfrom future generations. We can make the choice. Palau \r\nhas shown the choice it has already made.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nMs. Marie-Louise Potter, Head of the Delegation \r\nof Seychelles.\r\nMs. Potter (Seychelles): Allow me to add \r\nSeychelles’ voice to those who have congratulated \r\nAmbassador Peter Thomson on his election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I \r\nalso thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his commitment \r\nand strong leadership as the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session.\r\nHumankind finds itself on the cusp of achieving \r\nthe immeasurable in terms of making a true difference \r\nto all peoples of the world. As we embark upon this new \r\ncollaborative journey, our sustained momentum could \r\nbe a catalyst for positive change. We need an institution \r\nthat is not afraid of change and is able to address the \r\nchallenges of the twenty-first century. Such terms as \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 37/53\r\ninclusiveness, compromise and equality should resonate \r\nthroughout the Organization. On this note, allow me \r\nto reiterate Seychelles’ calls for fair reform within this \r\nHall, while renewing our commitment to the ideals of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe chosen theme for this year’s Assembly, “The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push \r\nto transform our world”, reminds us of the urgency \r\nof the present moment. Within the context of change \r\nand transformation, the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) played a significant and crucial role, \r\nwhich was to herald a much-needed call for nations \r\nto improve the livelihoods of society’s weak and \r\nmarginalized by addressing poverty in its many \r\nforms, while also promoting human rights and \r\nenvironmental sustainability.\r\nSeychelles is proud to have achieved most of the \r\ntargets set out in the MDGs and remains eager to \r\nfulfil its responsibility to sustain the momentum in \r\nimplementing the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs). Yes, we recognize that progress has been \r\nmade both nationally and internationally, but we also \r\nrecognize that much still needs to be done.\r\nIn Seychelles that recognition is reflected by our \r\npush to integrate the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the African Union Agenda 2063 into \r\nour national development strategy. However, I believe \r\nthat the path to transformation is not one that can be \r\ntravelled alone. SDG 17, which focuses on global \r\npartnership for sustainable development, reaffirms this \r\npoint.\r\nFor real change to occur, the world will need to \r\nstand together in ensuring that strong action is backed \r\nby the adequate financial support that is needed for \r\noverall achievement of the Goals, including giving due \r\nconsideration to the special conditions that small States \r\nand small island developing States are faced with. The \r\nimplementation of a vulnerability index in development \r\nframeworks would enable a fairer measurement of \r\neconomies and serve as a more appropriate reference \r\ntool for financial support than the traditionally \r\nemphasized per capita gross domestic product.\r\nGoal 14 in particular plays a pertinent role in our \r\npeoples’ lives. The conservation and sustainable use of \r\nthe oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable \r\ndevelopment has become pivotal to the survival of \r\nsmall-island economies.\r\nAs a champion of the Blue Economy initiative, which \r\nis directed at reinforcing marine-related activities for \r\nsustainability purposes, Seychelles recognizes that our \r\noceans present an abundance of untapped opportunities \r\nfor sustained growth. It is therefore imperative to \r\nhighlight that the Blue Economy concept and SDG 14 \r\nare synonymous with the global action to harness the \r\npower of the oceans as a tool for transformation. It is \r\nimportant in this endeavour that we shift the paradigm \r\nand view the world in innovative ways. In relation to \r\nthe Blue Economy, the “blue bonds” initiative and the \r\ndebt-swap agreement serve as tangible examples of \r\nSeychelles’ contribution to the debate.\r\nOne of the elements underpinning the Blue Economy \r\napproach is action to address climate change. Because \r\nSeychelles is an island nation heavily dependent upon \r\nthe environment for its survival, climate change and \r\nits adverse effects occupy a permanent place in the \r\nminds of our people. We are exposed to its devastating \r\nconsequences not as mere bystanders, but through \r\nfirst-hand experience, which affects our families and \r\nthreatens our livelihoods. Addressing the impacts of \r\nclimate change is therefore an essential part of the \r\ndiscussion, as it involves the very future of our country. \r\nWith this in mind, Seychelles is compelled to put itself \r\nat the forefront of the fight against climate change, for \r\nit is a battle that we cannot afford to lose. In this vein, \r\nthe historic Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which \r\nSeychelles was among the first 20 States to ratify, \r\nhas been an encouraging sign of the international \r\ncommunity’s renewed political will to push for positive \r\nchange.\r\nThe security of our oceans forms yet another \r\nintegral part of the drive towards human progress. \r\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing imperils \r\nthis progress not only by endangering our marine \r\necosystems, but also by harming food security and \r\njeopardizing the livelihoods of millions of people \r\nworldwide. Seychelles therefore renews its commitment \r\nto ensuring that such violations do not go unanswered. \r\nFurthermore, although we have seen tremendous \r\ngains in the long battle fought against piracy, we need \r\nto remain vigilant and strengthen our own efforts to \r\nreduce piracy-related activities in our oceans. To that \r\nend, the work undertaken through such initiatives as \r\nthe Contact Group for Piracy off the Coast of Somalia, \r\nwhich Seychelles currently chairs, is essential for our \r\ncontinued success.\r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n38/53 16-29823\r\nSeychelles fully supports all international efforts \r\naimed at seeking a diplomatic and political solution to \r\nthe ongoing crisis in Syria, which continues to rage at the \r\nexpense of the innocent. We deeply hope that a solution \r\nis found to further contribute to mitigating the spread \r\nof extremism and ideologies of hate, which continues to \r\nwreak devastating consequences on various countries \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nThe World Humanitarian Summit in Turkey and the \r\nrecent high-level plenary meeting on addressing large \r\nmovements of refugees and migrants hosted by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly serve to highlight \r\nthe scale of the challenges facing the global community. \r\nSuch challenges also solicit deeper reflection on the \r\nplight of the more than 60 million people in the world \r\nwho are displaced as a result of conflicts and natural \r\ndisasters linked to climate change. Seychelles calls upon \r\nthe international community for renewed collaboration \r\namong States and stronger moral resolve, as together \r\nwe endeavour to address the global humanitarian crisis \r\nthat is weighing heavily on the heart of humankind.\r\nSeychelles welcomes the normalization of relations \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba, and we reiterate \r\nour hope to see an end to the painful economic embargo \r\non a sister island nation.\r\nLastly, I wish to take this opportunity to express \r\nour utmost appreciation for the dynamism, hard work \r\nand devotion of our outgoing Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon during his term in office. He leaves behind a \r\nstrong legacy of determination to create a more peaceful \r\nand equal future for the world. Furthermore, his \r\nchampioning of the cause of small islands will remain \r\nengraved in our collective memory. We are certain that \r\nhis contributions to improving society will continue to \r\nhave positive repercussions and that the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral will follow in his righteous path.\r\nIn conclusion, I am hopeful for the future we believe \r\nin and that the inherent goodness of humankind will \r\nlead us to do what is right. At this critical time we have \r\na shared responsibility to cast aside our differences and \r\nfocus on what unites us rather than what divides us. \r\nI hope that together we can commence our universal \r\npush to transform our world, not only for ourselves but \r\nfor generations to come.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ib Petersen, Chair of the Delegation of Denmark.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): At the outset, Denmark \r\nwishes to warmly welcome and congratulate the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji. It \r\nwas an honour for Denmark to assume the presidency \r\nof the Assembly at its seventieth session, and we thank \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his excellent \r\nwork. We wish President Thomson every success in \r\nleading our crucial work in the year ahead.\r\nWe live in volatile times. It is therefore up to all \r\nof us to strengthen international cooperation and make \r\nit more effective. We must do so in order to foster a \r\npeaceful, sustainable and rights-based international \r\nsociety built on the ambitious common goals that we \r\nhave adopted this fall.\r\nWhile the challenges facing the United Nations \r\ntoday may seem daunting, our recent record does give \r\ncause for optimism. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, the successful conclusion \r\nof the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, as well \r\nas the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit, have \r\ndemonstrated our ability to come together to address \r\ntoday’s global challenges. However, our task now is to \r\nturn our shared agenda into real change that will benefit \r\npeople around the world. With a new Secretary-General \r\ncoming into office, this will be a pivotal year for the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nDenmark has always believed that global challenges \r\nmust be addressed through effective collective efforts, \r\nwith a sharp focus on the rights and freedoms of the \r\nindividual human being. Denmark has a vision for \r\naction that is based on three core elements — dignity, \r\ndevelopment and dialogue. Those elements characterize \r\nour approach to the work of the United Nations and will \r\nguide our candidacy for the Human Rights Council for \r\nthe 2019-2021 term.\r\nAround the world, many people are denied a life of \r\ndignity. Armed conflicts and violent extremism have \r\nled to human rights abuses and violations in several \r\nparts of the world. Syria, Iraq and the Sahel region are \r\nexperiencing some of the most serious and urgent crises \r\nfacing us today. In many other places, violence and \r\ninstability are causing immeasurable human suffering. \r\nMillions of people are subject to oppression, slavery and \r\ntrafficking by the dark forces of the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Levant (ISIL) and other extremist groups, which \r\nrequires a strong and determined collective response.\r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 39/53\r\nIn Mali, Denmark actively contributes to the \r\npromotion of peace and stability. We donate to \r\nthe United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in Mali and are engaged in long-\r\nterm development cooperation with the country. In \r\nSyria and Iraq, Denmark contributes significantly to \r\nthe fight against ISIL, including through support for \r\nlocal communities in the aftermath of conflict. We \r\nmust ensure that military achievements against ISIL \r\nare followed up with determined and coordinated \r\nefforts to sustain peace. Without such efforts, we will \r\nnot succeed. This autumn, Denmark will launch a new \r\nthree-year regional stabilization programme for Syria \r\nand Iraq. The main focus will be to support immediate \r\nstabilization efforts in areas of Iraq that have been \r\nliberated from ISIL.\r\nOur common security also depends on nations \r\nadhering to the norms and rules laid out by the United \r\nNations, whether in the General Assembly, the Security \r\nCouncil or other organs and agencies. All countries \r\nmust abide by their obligations under international law, \r\nincluding on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. \r\nIn that regard, Denmark condemns the recent nuclear \r\ntests conducted by the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea and urges the international community to \r\nrespond in a strong and unified manner.\r\nIn the past week the world came together to address \r\nthe mounting challenge of millions of people forced to \r\nf lee from their homes due to armed conflict, natural \r\ndisasters or poverty. A staggering 65 million people \r\nwere displaced in 2015, requiring a determined and \r\neffective response from the United Nations. Denmark \r\nwelcomes the New York Declaration for Refugees and \r\nMigrants (resolution 71/1), adopted last week, which \r\nunderlinines the principle of shared responsibility and \r\nthe importance of addressing the fundamental causes \r\nof migration. Denmark is among the largest per capita \r\nhumanitarian donors in the world, and we will continue \r\nto do our part. Poverty and a lack of opportunity are \r\namong the underlying factors leading to conflict and \r\ninstability; they are also key factors in driving people \r\nfrom their homes.\r\nDelivery on sustainable development and the \r\neradication of extreme poverty are vital avenues towards \r\na free, peaceful, prosperous world and in addressing \r\nthe fundamental causes of migration. Denmark’s \r\ndevelopment cooperation is a concrete testament to \r\nour commitment to the United Nations and to assisting \r\nthe world’s poorest and most vulnerable people. Since \r\n1978 — for almost four decades — Denmark has been \r\nmeeting the target of providing 0.7 per cent of its gross \r\nnational income to official development assistance. \r\nWe strongly urge many more countries to meet the \r\nsame goal.\r\nA pre-eminent challenge on the path to sustainable \r\ndevelopment is climate change. We must all take up the \r\nchallenge of turning the commitments set forth in the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change into action, to bring \r\nabout immense and positive change for the planet and \r\nfor people. All of those present in this Hall can count on \r\nDenmark to be at the forefront in that endeavour — in \r\nterms of follow-up both at home and internationally. \r\nThe Danish Government will put forward a motion \r\nfor ratification of the Paris Agreement in the Danish \r\nParliament on 5 October.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals can be achieved \r\nonly if cooperation is integrated across different fields \r\nand sectors. The United Nations development system \r\nmust be reformed and made truly fit for purpose. The \r\nUnited Nations system must completely rethink its \r\noperational approach. The silo mentality and internal \r\ncompetition for resources must become phenomena of \r\nthe past.\r\nDenmark firmly believes that we need a \r\nsignificantly strengthened focus on the role of young \r\npeople. The 2030 Agenda on Sustainable Development \r\nis essentially an agenda for future generations. \r\nAccordingly, the engagement of the world’s young \r\npeople in its implementation is indispensable. Young \r\npeople possess enormous potential and must be involved \r\nin the work ahead.\r\nWe also need civil society, academia and the \r\nprivate sector to support policy implementation and \r\nprovide innovative solutions and know-how. We need \r\nto engage in fruitful public-private partnerships to push \r\nimplementation even further.\r\nGovernments can play an important role in further \r\nencouraging private business and investors to contribute \r\nto implementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. That is why the Prime Minister of Denmark last \r\nweek announced a new Sustainable Development Goals \r\ninvestment fund. The goal is to raise capital from private \r\ninvestors and reach a capital base of up to $750 million. \r\nInvestments will be made across the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals — to improve energy, climate \r\nmitigation, industry, infrastructure, food production \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n40/53 16-29823\r\nand health care in order to generate sustainable growth, \r\njobs and tax revenue in developing countries.\r\nIn addition, we need global free trade as an \r\nessential element in fostering long-term development \r\nand economic growth. Denmark is actively advocating \r\nfor creating better market access for developing \r\ncountries and improving business conditions, including \r\nat the World Trade Organization. In short, if goods pass \r\nborders, it is less likely that soldiers will.\r\nThe effectiveness of the United Nations system, and \r\nindeed our ability to turn the promise of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals into reality, begins and ends with \r\nthe willingness of Member States to work together. \r\nAddressing global challenges through dialogue is the \r\nraison d’être of the United Nations, and it resonates \r\nwith Danish political tradition. That is why, from the \r\nbeginning, we have been deeply engaged in building \r\nup the Organization. This is also true in very concrete \r\nterms, as the Trusteeship Council Chamber, located \r\nnext to this General Assembly Hall, was designed \r\nby the Danish architect Finn Juhl, whose design was \r\nprecisely intended to foster dialogue among delegates, \r\nthereby promoting the democratic mission of the \r\nUnited Nations. In all modesty, we think he succeeded \r\nquite well.\r\nMore than 50 years of partnerships in international \r\ndevelopment with an approach based on dialogue has \r\ntaught us the value of partnership in ensuring progress. \r\nAs just one example, Denmark has for decades been a \r\nstrong supporter of national human rights institutions \r\nand commissions, ombudsmen and other independent \r\nhuman rights bodies, from the Middle East to Africa \r\nand Eurasia.\r\nGender equality and the empowerment of women, \r\nkey requirements for the achievement of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, are a cornerstone of our foreign \r\npolicy. Studies show that, when a girl receives just \r\none additional year of education, she can increase her \r\nearnings by up to 20 per cent. That is important, not \r\nonly for her but also for her family, her community and \r\nher country.\r\nDenmark was extremely proud to host the Women \r\nDeliver 2016 Global Conference in Copenhagen, earlier \r\nthis year. The Conference was a testimony to the \r\nimportance Denmark places on ensuring women’s and \r\ngirls’ full and equal enjoyment of all human rights. A \r\nplethora of programmes, initiatives and strategies were \r\nshowcased at the Conference, providing inspiration for \r\nwomen and men all over the world.\r\nAt home and abroad, Denmark promotes the \r\nhuman rights and values of indigenous peoples. We \r\nstand for their right to control and influence their \r\nown development paths and determine matters \r\nregarding their own economic, social, political and \r\ncultural situation.\r\nDenmark is one of the strongest voices in the \r\nglobal fight against torture. For decades we have \r\nensured the successful adoption of General Assembly \r\nresolutions that further the work on the elimination of \r\ntorture, as laid out in the Convention against Torture \r\nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \r\nPunishment. Implementation, however, is key. That \r\nis why we — together with Chile, Ghana, Indonesia \r\nand Morocco — have launched the Convention \r\nagainst Torture initiative. Our goal is to work towards \r\nuniversal ratification and better implementation of the \r\nConvention by 2024.\r\nAs the people’s Organization, the United Nations \r\nneeds to do better to foster trust, transparency and \r\nefficiency. I am proud that during Mr. Lykketoft’s \r\npresidency of the General Assembly important steps \r\nwere taken to increase transparency in the work of the \r\nOffice of the President as well in the selection process \r\nfor the next Secretary-General. If the United Nations \r\nis to remain a relevant and legitimate organization for \r\npeace, development and human rights, we must continue \r\non the path of increased openness and transparency. \r\nThat is in the shared interest of all Member States.\r\nIn conclusion, allow me, on behalf of the \r\nGovernment of Denmark, to take this opportunity \r\nto also pay tribute to the Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon. Denmark salutes the \r\nprogressive leadership and determination that the \r\nSecretary-General has displayed through a difficult \r\nand very challenging period in the history of the \r\nUnited Nations. He has tirelessly led the way to finding \r\nviable solutions to global challenges, in particular \r\nclimate change, which has been a journey that led us \r\nfrom Bali to Copenhagen and, finally, to Paris, and \r\nwhich resulted, last December, in an ambitious global \r\nagreement to fight climate change. Denmark reiterates \r\nits appreciation for the progressive leadership and \r\ndetermination of Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral show the same determination as his predecessor \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 41/53\r\nin forcefully addressing the challenges posed to the \r\nmillions of displaced persons, refugees and migrants \r\nacross the world, while ensuring the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda and undertaking the necessary crucial \r\nreforms of the United Nations. As we strive to reform \r\nthe Organization, Denmark will stand by the side of \r\nthe next Secretary-General and continue to support and \r\ntake active and constructive part in the critical work of \r\nthe United Nations going forward.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on \r\nMr. Kokou Kpayedo, Chair of the Delegation of the \r\nTogolese Republic.\r\nMr. Kpayedo (Togo) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe honour to deliver to the General Assembly a \r\nmessage from the His Excellency Mr. Faure Essozimna \r\nGnassingbé, President of the Togolese Republic.\r\n“It is with a feeling of shared joy that we take \r\npart in the seventy-first session of the General \r\nAssembly dedicated to the theme “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform \r\nour world”. First of all, I would like to express \r\nmy congratulations to Mr. Peter Thomson on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session.\r\n“I also wish to pay tribute to Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who has worked tirelessly \r\nto strengthen the work of our Organization during \r\nthe past decade. Mr. Ban Ki-moon was able to \r\nsuccessfully guide the United Nations in the process \r\ntowards the design and adoption of a new framework \r\nthat will lead the Organization and the people of \r\nthe planet for the next 15 years. I am speaking of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\r\n“A year ago, we adopted the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) with the aim of \r\ntransforming the world. Since then, we have \r\ntogether begun the process of implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda to build a more prosperous, inclusive \r\nand secure world. I am therefore happy to see \r\nthe relevance of the central theme submitted to \r\nMember States, because the realization of the SDGs \r\ndefinitely requires a new impetus of our countries \r\nindividually and collectively and a resolute \r\ncommitment by the entire international community.\r\n“At the High-level Political Forum on \r\nSustainable Development, held under the auspices \r\nof the Economic and Social Council in July, Togo, \r\na pilot country for the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, offered to participate in an exercise on the \r\nadvancement of the integration of the SDGs into the \r\nstrategies and national development programmes. \r\nOn that occasion, we were able to show progress in \r\nthe implementation of our SDG road map, and we \r\nwere also able to share the significant progress we \r\nhave made in the implementation of key actions to \r\nleave no one behind.\r\n“Specifically, our country has made significant \r\nprogress in economic growth, the reduction of \r\npoverty and the promotion of peaceful democracy, \r\nand remains determined to do everything we can to \r\nensure genuine, inclusive and sustainable growth. \r\nBecause of that determination, we launched, \r\nwith national financing and the assistance of \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, the \r\nimplementation of an emergency community \r\ndevelopment programme to help significantly \r\nimprove the living conditions of the most vulnerable \r\npopulations in our society.\r\n“Moreover, the encouragement we received \r\nin the progress in the area of human development, \r\nsuch as recognition by the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations of the Togolese \r\nprogramme on the fighting hunger and malnutrition, \r\ninspires our enthusiasm to intensify investment \r\nin development favouring the most vulnerable \r\nsectors. We also welcome the fact that the SDGs \r\nconfirm the validity of strategic initiatives that we \r\nhave been implementing in recent years, at the level \r\nof infrastructure and economic diversification and \r\nin the improvement of the business climate and \r\nthe promotion of young people’s and women’s \r\nentrepreneurship. Actions are under way to begin \r\nthe adoption process by the end of the year of \r\nthe implementation of our national sustainable \r\ndevelopment plan, which seamlessly integrates the \r\nSDGs and will follow on our accelerated growth \r\nstrategy and the promotion of employment for the \r\n2013-2017 period.\r\n“Recognizing that accountability for the results \r\nand mutual learning processes among countries are \r\ndeterminants for speeding up our progress towards \r\nthe achievement of the SDGs, Togo will participate \r\nin the voluntary review to take place at the next \r\nhigh-level political segment on the implementation \r\nof the SDGs. We therefore take this opportunity \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n42/53 16-29823\r\nbefore the Assembly to thank all entities of the \r\nUnited Nations system that have helped us in \r\nthis exercise.\r\n“It is our conviction that the SDGs should \r\nmake it possible to transform the world by giving \r\npriority to the most vulnerable groups — women, \r\nyoung people and children, populations threatened \r\nby conflicts and disasters, migrants and refugees. \r\nThe need to look out for the fortunes of our peoples \r\nwho had been left behind will assume a whole new \r\ndimension as we celebrate the thirtieth anniversary \r\nof the Declaration on the Right to Development. \r\nMaking development for the most vulnerable a \r\npriority is becoming increasingly crucial in the \r\ncurrent context, which is marked by multiple and \r\npressing challenges of persistent poverty and \r\nunemployment and threats to human security linked \r\nto climate change, disease, conflict and terrorism.\r\n“On actions for the protection of the environment, \r\nTogo is facing major climate challenges, such \r\nas coastal erosion, f looding, desertification and \r\nunpredictable rainy seasons. I take this opportunity \r\nat the Assembly to renew our firm commitment \r\nto the Paris Agreement. My country signed the \r\nAgreement and will do everything it can to aid \r\nin concluding the ratification process by the end \r\nof 2016. We are also doing everything possible to \r\nimplement it. We welcome the ratification of the \r\nAgreement, which is so important for the future \r\nand survival of our planet.\r\n“The era we live in is also marked by \r\na resurgence of new health challenges that \r\ncompromise the progress we have realized in \r\nhuman and economic terms. Since we are aware of \r\nthat reality, in my position as a coordinator of the \r\nEbola Virus Disease Outbreak Response Plan in \r\nWest Africa, I would like to thank all partners and \r\norganizations that made it possible for us to contain \r\nand even eliminate this epidemic.\r\n“Continuing in the area of health, I would like \r\nto pay tribute to all the organizations and Member \r\nStates that contributed to reducing the incidence of \r\nHIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis. Despite the \r\nprogress, we must not lower our guard because new \r\nhealth threats are on the horizon — diseases that in \r\nthe past were under control but might resurge. We \r\nneed to reinforce our health systems and policies \r\nin order to eradicate diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, \r\nbetter fight maternal and infant mortality and \r\nprotect our world against antimicrobial resistance.\r\n“No development programme will be able to \r\nsucceed and be sustainable if the national context \r\nin which it is to be implemented is not imbued with \r\npeace and cohesion. That is why my Government \r\nhas deployed so many efforts to eradicate poverty \r\nand hunger, which are considered to be the root \r\ncauses of insecurity and terrorism. Furthermore, \r\nwe are working towards strengthening democracy \r\nand the rule of law by implementing political \r\nand institutional reforms that are consistent with \r\nthe realities in our countries. In that regard, the \r\nrecently created the Togolese High Commission \r\nfor Reconciliation and Strengthening National \r\nUnity organized a workshop in July to reflect on \r\nand exchange views among all components of the \r\nTogolese nation with regard to establishing the \r\nbases for reforms that have not yet taken effect.\r\n“We are also working to step up democracy at \r\nthe local level in order to provide a better chance \r\nfor the success of our development strategy to \r\nreduce regional disparity. In order to do that, an \r\naccelerated plan of action and decentralization is \r\nalso being implemented and should lead in the near \r\nfuture to local elections.\r\n“In the area of the protection and promotion \r\nof human rights, we are determined to strengthen \r\nour achievements in order to better guarantee \r\nfundamental freedoms. We also plan to make better \r\nuse of our term in the Human Rights Council for \r\nthe 2016-2018 period. In that regard, my country, \r\nwhich has undertaken a number of reforms in \r\naccordance with the recommendations resulting \r\nfrom the first cycle of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, is preparing for the second cycle of the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review, which will take place \r\nfrom 31 October to 11 November.\r\n“The noble objectives that our countries \r\nhave set for themselves, in particular in the areas \r\nof sustainable development and the protection \r\nof the climate for future generations, cannot be \r\nachieved unless peace and security are guaranteed \r\nthroughout the world. In that regard, despite the \r\nefforts that have been made under the auspices of \r\nour Organization and regional institutions, peace \r\nand security continue to be threatened or put at \r\nrisk in certain regions. In Africa, Togo very much \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 43/53\r\nhopes that the efforts made by the United Nations \r\nand regional African organizations will help to \r\nbring peace to South Sudan and Libya, to cite but \r\ntwo countries. In that regard, Togo welcomes the \r\nfruitful discussions that took place in the African \r\nUnion Peace and Security Council several days ago \r\nregarding South Sudan’s future, and calls upon the \r\nparties involved to spare no effort in strengthening \r\nthe country’s foundations. Elsewhere in the world, \r\nmy country calls upon all parties involved in the \r\nSyrian conflict to work in good faith to ensure that \r\nthe Syrian people, crippled by a long conflict that \r\nhas destabilized the whole region, can once again \r\nfind peace, security and stability.\r\n“As we all know, the Syrian and the Libyan \r\ncrises in particular are fuelling the scourge of \r\nterrorism, from which no region in the world \r\nis currently spared. I would like to once again \r\nremember the countless victims of terrorism and \r\nto express Togo’s solidarity with the countries and \r\npopulations that have recently fallen victim to the \r\nscourge. An effective counter-terrorism strategy \r\nrequires States to continue working together by \r\nfurther strengthening the cooperation among their \r\nrelevant technical units. The wealthiest countries \r\nmust also agree to support more than they do \r\nalready States like Togo that do not have the \r\nnecessary resources to effectively fight terrorism.\r\n“In the light of the increasing risks and threats \r\nin our world today, our top priority must be to equip \r\nourselves with the means to effectively and swiftly \r\naddress the varying challenges that are affecting \r\nthe well-being of our populations and limiting \r\nour economic development. Security threats are a \r\nhuge risk for our agenda of transforming the world \r\nand require us to intensify our efforts to promote \r\ninternational peace and security. To meet that \r\nrequirement, my country will host the African \r\nUnion Extraordinary Summit of Heads of State and \r\nGovernment on Maritime Security and Safety and \r\nDevelopment in Africa from 10 to 15 October. The \r\nSummit’s aim is to agree on a joint declaration that \r\ncan better prevent and address maritime insecurity \r\nand promote sustainable and inclusive development \r\nof the blue economy in line with the SDGs and the \r\nParis Agreement. I wish to once again take this \r\nopportunity to extend an invitation to Member \r\nStates to take part in the high-level Summit, which \r\nwill involve all stakeholders from my country.\r\n“Seventy years after its creation, the United \r\nNations has greatly contributed to progress in the \r\nworld by promoting peace, sustainable development \r\nand human rights. It has been able to bring about \r\nsuch change by reforming some of its own organs \r\nin order to take into account the world’s shifting \r\ncircumstances, which Togo welcomes. However, \r\nour Organization, which continues to work towards \r\nthe rooting of democracy in its Member States, has \r\nfound it difficult to reform the Security Council. \r\nIts current composition does not reflect real \r\ndevelopment in the world. My country believes that \r\nit is high time for Member States, and particularly \r\nfor the five permanent members of the Council, to \r\nresolve to undertake a reform of the organ, which \r\nis the only way to avoid the frequent deadlock that \r\nprevents the Council from taking action and rapidly \r\nsolving crises and conflicts. At a time when the \r\ninternational community is resolutely committed \r\nto pursuing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment for the benefit of all, any further delay \r\nin the process of reforming the Security Council \r\ncan only be harmful to the fulfilment of the SDGs.\r\n“Addressing all of those challenges calls for \r\neffective and inclusive mobilization with the means \r\nto bring about the necessary changes for a better \r\nworld. More specifically, a transformation of the \r\nAfrican economy is key to eliminating poverty and \r\nhunger, providing young people with a future and \r\ncurbing economic migrants. Such transformation \r\nis also the best protection against terrorism and \r\nthe world’s growing insecurity and is essential in \r\ngiving fresh impetus to growth and in reducing \r\npressure on the environment. Transforming the \r\nAfrican economy will help to solve the world’s \r\nchallenges, but we must stay in line with the \r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda and be mobilized \r\nfor subsequent investments through various \r\nmechanisms, in accordance with Agenda 2063: The \r\nAfrica We Want.\r\n“Our collective ambition is the well-being of \r\neveryone, which means that no one should be left \r\nbehind. In that regard, efforts need to be undertaken \r\nthat favour Africa, which is home to the greatest \r\nnumber of poor countries, in order to ensure its \r\ninclusion in the world economy. Moreover, the \r\nAfrican continent remains an important lever for \r\ntransforming the world in the SDG era, as it offers \r\nhuge potential for a profound transformation of \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n44/53 16-29823\r\nour world, with a youth population full of vitality, \r\ndynamic demographic growth, a wealth of natural \r\nresources, ingenuity and resilient men and women. \r\nIn order to benefit from Africa’s potential, we \r\nmust remove the obstacles that impede its social \r\nand economic development as soon as possible, in \r\norder to reap the positive benefits at a global level, \r\nincluding in the areas of climate, peace, security, \r\nhealth and the right to development.\r\n“In the hope of an innovative United Nations \r\npartnership that can transform the world, starting \r\nwith Africa, I welcome the commitment shown by \r\nthe international community in its adoption of the \r\nSDGs. I remain convinced that the current session \r\nof the General Assembly will allow us to capitalize \r\non the commitment to strengthen our collective \r\nworking capacity between now and 2030, so as to \r\nbring about a world that is more secure, prosperous \r\nand equal, and which demonstrates solidarity and \r\nrespects human rights, in response to the deep-\r\nseated aspirations of our peoples.”\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate. Before proceeding to \r\nstatements by Member States in the exercise of the right \r\nof reply, we shall now hear two closing statements on \r\nthe occasion of the conclusion of our debate.\r\nI now give the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson, Deputy Secretary-General, to make closing \r\nremarks on behalf of the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: I thank you, Sir, \r\nfor giving me this opportunity to make a few informal \r\nremarks at the end of the general debate on behalf of \r\nthe Secretary-General, who is currently in Bogotá \r\ncelebrating the peace agreement in Colombia.\r\nI wish to commend Member States for the high \r\nquality of their statements during the general debate, \r\nthe high level of attendance and the seriousness with \r\nwhich they have described the current situation in the \r\nworld, from their different perspectives. I have not \r\nspent as much time as I would have liked to in the Hall, \r\nbut I have enjoyed every minute of it when I was able to \r\nbe here, and we have naturally read all the statements \r\nmade. I commend members for the work they have done \r\nin preparing for this year’s general debate.\r\nThis is the time of year when, here at the United \r\nNations, we take the world’s temperature, which \r\nis currently running quite high. But I also see many \r\nreasons for hope, as Member States have been very \r\nprincipled in their remarks, sticking to the ideals of the \r\nOrganization and the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and respecting the work \r\nin all pillars of the United Nations, whether it be peace \r\nand security, development or human rights. The general \r\ndebate has been a great tribute to internationalism and \r\nmultilateralism in a day and age when those concepts \r\nare being tested.\r\nWe therefore need to understand that, in order to \r\nachieve what we want, our work in the Organization \r\nmust be ongoing and tireless. If we can show enough \r\nskill and diligence to create satisfactory international \r\nsolutions to today’s problems, we will increasingly \r\nfind that these international solutions and formulas are \r\nalso in the national interest of Member States. We must \r\ntherefore remove the often artificial line between the \r\nconcepts of international and national. I know that the \r\nPresident will mention some of the highlights of the \r\ndebate in his summary, but let me just mention very \r\nbriefly how much the Secretary-General and I have \r\ndeeply appreciated the Assembly’s strong emphasis.\r\nFirst of all, on the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nthe Assembly’s great achievement accomplished in \r\nSeptember last year, or rather in the three and a half \r\nyears leading up to their adoption. I think it is a historic \r\nachievement. Member States have laid the foundation \r\nfor a new direction in development. When one adds up \r\nthe Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the \r\nAddis Ababa Action Agenda, the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) and the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change, it is a remarkable \r\nchance for there to be a new development path for \r\nMember States and other actors worldwide to follow.\r\nIn addition, I know that the Secretary-General \r\nparticularly appreciated the Assembly’s strong emphasis \r\non climate change issues. As is well known, his role in \r\non those issues has been active and instrumental, but it \r\nwould never have happened unless Member States had \r\ncome to the conclusion that we must shift course in the \r\ninterest of future generations, the planet and our life on \r\nit. There might be a plan B in life, but there certainly \r\nis no planet B.\r\nI also think that the high-level meeting on \r\nrefugees and migration coloured this year’s general \r\ndebate. Solidarity with refugees and the problems for \r\ncountries of origin, countries of transit and countries of \r\ndestination came to the fore, and we mobilized around \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 45/53\r\nthe xenophobia that sometimes is visible in today’s \r\nworld.\r\nWe have to make sure that we see the advantages \r\nof people moving across borders, although we know \r\nthat sometimes such movements signal tremendous \r\nchallenges. However, the New York Declaration, of \r\n19 September 2016, together with the leaders’ summit \r\non refugees led by President Obama, has given a new \r\nstructure to the work on refugees and migration that \r\nwill be very useful. Above all, I hope that we will make \r\nsure that the Organization sends a signal that everybody \r\nis of equal value and that we need to work in such a \r\nway as to prevent xenophobic tendencies, which are so \r\nstrong in today’s world, from prevailing.\r\nWith respect to conflicts, I could go on forever, \r\nbut I will mention only Syria — the horror of Syria, \r\nthe nightmare of Syria — and both the need to move \r\ntowards stopping the horrific fighting — the many \r\nstrong statements made in that regard impressed \r\nus — and the need for us to then do the humanitarian \r\nwork that the United Nations wants to do once the \r\nfighting is reduced in intensity. That would, in turn, \r\nlead to the possibility of starting a political process, \r\nthe prospects for which look pretty sombre today. But \r\nwe cannot abandon this perspective. The suffering has \r\ngone on far too long. The dangers for the region and the \r\nworld are enormous. We must mobilize to stop this war.\r\nNext, I would also like to commend the new efforts \r\nby both the General Assembly and the Security Council \r\nto accept the notion and concept of sustaining peace, \r\nthat peace is something that we need to think about, in \r\nterms of both prevention — reducing violence — and \r\npost-conflict work. In that regard, I think that in our \r\nhands lies great potential, together with the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, to cross the border lines between \r\npeace, security, development and human rights. It is a \r\ngreat challenge for the United Nations, and I hope that \r\nwe all accept and adopt it.\r\nThe last point is simply to express, on behalf of \r\nthe Secretary-General, his gratitude to the members of \r\nthe General Assembly for the very generous and warm \r\ncomments about his 10-year term. He has been hard \r\nat work for all these 10 years. Although I have done \r\nonly half that number, I understand the tremendous \r\npressure he has been under. But the comments made on \r\nhis role in different areas, not least in climate change, \r\nhave warmed his heart. I am certain of that. I will \r\nconvey members’ comments on his accomplishments \r\nto him. Above all, I want to convey to him the spirit \r\nin which all members have contributed to a very good \r\ngeneral debate. This is also my own last general debate. \r\nOnce again, I thank the President for giving me this \r\nopportunity to present remarks in this informal way at \r\nthe end of the debate.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the Deputy \r\nSecretary-General for his statement.\r\nIt is now my honour to deliver this closing statement \r\non behalf of the President of the General Assembly, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson, who, as we speak, is \r\nparticipating in the signing of the Colombian peace \r\ndeal in Colombia today.\r\n“The general debate of the General Assembly \r\nprovides us with a portrait of the current state of \r\nour world, painted for us by the Heads of State, \r\nHeads of Government and Ministers of the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. Over the past six \r\ndays, we have heard from members of the Assembly \r\nabout their priorities and concerns as well as their \r\nhopes for peace, human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Leaders recalled and reaffirmed \r\nthe spirit and the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and confirmed their faith in the \r\ncentral role of the United Nations in international \r\ncooperation. They also addressed many of today’s \r\ncritical global issues.\r\n“In line with the theme of the seventy-first \r\nsession, many leaders expressed their commitment \r\nto implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. We began with a moving \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) moment, \r\nwhich reminded us of how transformative the SDGs \r\nwill be and how urgently action is now required to \r\nimplement them. I am greatly encouraged by the \r\nfact that so many Member States have already \r\nembedded the SDGs into their plans and policies. \r\nThe task at hand is implementation of the SDGs, \r\nand I was encouraged by the many side events last \r\nweek that emphasized the need for action.\r\n“Wednesday’s parallel meeting on antimicrobial \r\nresistance stressed the urgent need for a global \r\nresponse to address that critical issue, the impact \r\nof which threatens millions of lives and progress \r\nacross the SDGs.\r\n“I reiterate my call to Member States to see \r\nthe SDGs included in the education curriculums \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n46/53 16-29823\r\nof every country around the world. It is the young \r\npeople of the world who must know the SDGs in \r\nall their universal and integrated dimensions, since \r\nthey will be the inheritors of the 2030 Agenda.\r\n“Action on climate change is of course essential. \r\nI congratulate the Secretary-General on the success \r\nof his Paris Agreement ratification ceremony last \r\nweek. I note that we now need ratifications from \r\nparties to the Agreement covering only a further \r\n7.5 per cent of global greenhouse-gas emissions to \r\nsee the Agreement enter into force. I am confident \r\nwe will see this happen prior to the twenty-second \r\nsession of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, in Morocco. I urge all members not just \r\nto ratify the agreement promptly, but to scale up \r\nthe level of ambition in reducing emissions in order \r\nto limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C above \r\npre-industrial levels, and to mobilize the climate \r\nfinance required to support vulnerable countries \r\nlike the small island developing States and others.\r\n“Looking ahead, I am glad that many leaders \r\nidentified the forthcoming third United Nations \r\nConference on Housing and Sustainable Urban \r\nDevelopment, in Ecuador next month, and the SDG \r\n14 conference on oceans, to take place in June \r\n2017, as additional major opportunities to drive \r\nSDG implementation.\r\n“The plight of refugees, internally displaced \r\npersons and migrants across our world was a \r\nfocus of last week’s deliberations. The adoption \r\nof the New York Declaration for Refugees and \r\nMigrants (resolution 71/1) at last Monday’s high-\r\nlevel summit was an important step forward. The \r\nsummit launched a process that I will take forward \r\nduring this session with a view to adopting two \r\nglobal compacts on migrants and on refugees in \r\n2018.\r\n“The current global humanitarian and refugee \r\ncrisis has its roots in a number of ongoing conflicts \r\nin our world and has been exacerbated by the \r\nimpacts of climate change. I joined the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and Member States in condemning the \r\nunacceptable attacks on a United Nations aid \r\nconvoy in Aleppo and in calling for a renewed \r\neffort on the part of global and regional powers to \r\nfind a peaceful political solution.\r\n“Many Member States called for a resumption \r\nof the Middle East peace process in order to find \r\na lasting solution. They also stressed the need to \r\nsolve other conflicts and to address the spread of \r\nviolent extremism and terrorism.\r\n“In relation to United Nations capacities in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, \r\nmany recalled the historic endorsement by the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council of \r\nthe concept of sustaining peace, while several \r\nMember States made reference to the importance \r\nof women’s participation in peace processes and \r\nof implementing commitments following the 2015 \r\nreview of resolution 1325 (2000), on women and \r\npeace and security.\r\n“Numerous speakers stressed the pressing \r\nneed for reform of the Security Council, while \r\nmany others highlighted the critical importance of \r\nadvancing disarmament. Those calls will no doubt \r\nbe echoed in today’s high-level plenary meeting \r\nat United Nations Headquarters to commemorate \r\nand promote the International Day for the Total \r\nElimination of Nuclear Weapons.\r\n“In the area of human rights, Member States \r\nrenewed their call for the promotion and protection \r\nof all human rights and for dedicated efforts \r\ntowards the empowerment of women and girls. \r\nMember States emphasized the interrelationship \r\nbetween human rights, peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Such linkages were also highlighted \r\nin the context of last Thursday’s high-level meeting \r\ncommemorating the thirtieth anniversary of the \r\nDeclaration on the Right to Development. Some \r\nmembers also recalled the challenges related to \r\nintolerance and xenophobia and the continuing \r\nneed to tackle all forms of discrimination.\r\n“Last week we witnessed Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon’s final address in a general debate. \r\nHis statement was a testimony both to the work he \r\nhas done these past nine years and to the scale of \r\nthe challenges his successor will face. The selection \r\nand appointment of that successor were addressed \r\nby almost every Member State. This is a matter \r\nthat I will manage with great care over the coming \r\nmonths, in line with the principles of transparency \r\nand accountability and with a view to ensuring a \r\nsmooth transition. \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 47/53\r\n“This is but a synopsis of the many issues \r\nraised these past six days. Member States’ \r\nengagement, and that of the many stakeholders that \r\nhave joined us this week, demonstrates once again \r\nthe unique nature of the general debate. It is the \r\nembodiment of the equality of nations and provides \r\nMember States with an opportunity to advance our \r\ncollective pursuit of solutions to global challenges \r\nthrough dialogue and cooperation.\r\n“At the same time, I am concerned that the \r\nstandard of decorum during the general debate \r\nappears to be slipping, with high levels of noise \r\nin the Hall and its surrounds; with the allocated \r\nspeaking time often ignored; with low attendance \r\nby delegations as the debate progresses; and with \r\nthe proliferation of mandated and other events \r\nhappening simultaneously with the general debate. \r\nI will therefore encourage the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to consider that matter during \r\nthe seventy-first session.\r\n“To conclude, let me express my sincere \r\nappreciation to all of the staff of the United \r\nNations — the Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management, the interpreters, \r\nsecurity officers, protocol, maintenance staff and \r\nothers — for their professionalism throughout. \r\nAllow me to thank Member States for their kind \r\nwords of personal congratulations and support. \r\nI look forward to representing each and every \r\none to the best of my ability during the seventy-\r\nfirst session.”\r\nSeveral delegations have asked to speak in exercise \r\nof the right of reply. May I remind representatives \r\nthat statements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention, and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Horoi (Solomon Islands): Solomon Islands \r\nwould like to exercise its right of reply to the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Indonesia on \r\n24 September, regarding the ongoing human rights \r\nviolations of the Melanesian people in West Papua (see \r\nA/71/PV.21).\r\nSolomon Islands notes Indonesia’s right of \r\nreply regarding the efforts made by the Indonesian \r\nGovernment to establish human rights monitoring \r\nmechanisms and other avenues to ensure that human \r\nrights violations in West Papua are addressed. We note \r\nthat Indonesia ratified the Convention against Torture \r\nand Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or \r\nPunishment in 1998, but to date it has not been able to \r\nharmonize the law to include the definition of torture, \r\nlet alone to criminalize and punish torture. Moreover, \r\nIndonesia has not submitted its periodic report to the \r\nCommittee against Torture since 2008.\r\nThe Solomon Islands delegation receives reports \r\nfrom respective sources of fellow States Members \r\nof the United Nations and moral leaders from civil \r\nsociety, illustrating a lack of protection of the human \r\nrights of the Melanesian people of West Papua. In that \r\nregard, Solomon Islands therefore invites Indonesia to \r\nsubstantiate its allegations that the Solomon Islands, \r\ntogether with the five other Pacific Island delegations, \r\nhave used false and fabricated information by allowing \r\nUnited Nations Special Rapporteurs mandated by the \r\nHuman Rights Council to visit West Papua and Papua. \r\nOur concern has to do with the increasing loss of \r\nlives at the hands of Indonesia authorities. We may \r\nargue and concede that mistakes are made and that lives \r\nare lost as a consequence, but how can we, as members \r\nof this body — the defender of human rights and the \r\nbody of reference in ethical and moral values — turn \r\na blind eye to the deaths of more than 500,000 West \r\nPapuans over the course of the past 50 years?\r\nAs an island country in the region that Indonesia \r\nclaims to be a part of, Solomon Islands cannot stand \r\nbehind the argument of sovereignty and integrity of any \r\ncountry and watch such atrocities take place. It is our \r\nmoral and ethical duty, as members of this gathering, \r\nto bring this unfortunate reality to the fore and to find \r\na way together to stop the loss of lives and protect the \r\nrights of all human beings, be they Melanesians, West \r\nPapuans or any other. \r\nFurthermore, we come together to agree on certain \r\nrights and hold each other accountable to those rights. \r\nArticle 3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nstipulates that “[e]veryone has the right to life, liberty \r\nand security of person”. Indonesia has ratified the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \r\nwhich is also a binding legal instrument. Article 9 of \r\nthe Covenant reinforces the right to liberty and security \r\nof person. Article 3 of the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights entails a responsibility to protect all \r\npopulations from mass atrocities, crimes and human \r\nrights violations. \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n48/53 16-29823\r\nIn essence, we uphold the argument of sovereignty \r\nand national integrity. We, as States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations, should also hold other Member States \r\naccountable under article 3 of the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights and article 9 of the International \r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights.\r\nIndonesia has further clarified the many \r\ndevelopment challenges faced by the Solomon Islands. \r\nSuch is the case with the five other Pacific Island States \r\nthat were mentioned by the representative of Indonesia \r\nin his right of reply. Earlier in this meeting, the \r\nrepresentative of Palau indicated that our challenges \r\nare difficult ones and we know full well that we alone \r\ncannot and will not be able to resolve them. That is why \r\nwe highlight those challenges before this body. \r\nIn a similar vein, we highlight the human rights \r\nviolations in West Papua because we realize that neither \r\nwe nor Indonesia can resolve that matter alone. We are \r\nof the position that the matter needs to be brought to \r\nthe attention of a United Nations body. It needs to be \r\ndone urgently as lives are being lost, in all impunity. \r\nAll lives matter. West Papuan lives matter. Solomon \r\nIslands wishes to reiterate its willingness to engage \r\nconstructively with Indonesia on the matter of West \r\nPapua. In fact, our Pacific regional and subregional \r\nbodies have indicated their willingness to discuss these \r\nmatters with Indonesia, as we are all concerned about \r\nthe increasing loss of life in West Papua.\r\nOver the past 20 years, our Pacific island countries \r\nhave expressed the need for dialogue with Indonesia \r\nover human rights violations. Over the past 18 months, \r\nthe regional and subregional organizations of the \r\nPacific island countries have made three attempts to \r\nengage constructively with Indonesia. Indonesia’s lack \r\nof will to engage will not dampen the commitment \r\nof Solomon Islands, together with six other Pacific \r\nIsland countries, to pursue dialogue and constructive \r\nengagement, which are the only means of resolving \r\nthis matter. We understand that through constructive \r\nengagement and dialogue we can realize the Articles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the subsequent \r\ninternational human rights instruments that Indonesia \r\nhas ratified.\r\nIn closing, the Solomon Islands welcomes the \r\nopportunity to highlight this case before the Assembly \r\nso that, together as a family of nations, we can — and \r\nwe must — address the human rights violations and \r\nloss of lives in West Papua. It impinges on us, as States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, to cast aside all barriers \r\nso that further lives are not lost in West Papua. We are \r\nhere to enable the divine purpose of the universe to \r\nunfold, for life is sacred.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): The Pakistan delegation is \r\nobliged to respond to the statement made by the Foreign \r\nMinister of India earlier today.\r\nHer statement is a litany of falsehoods about my \r\ncountry and a travesty of facts and history that reflects \r\nonly the deceit and hostility of her Government towards \r\nPakistan. We reject all the baseless allegations made \r\nin that statement. These allegations are designed \r\nprincipally to deflect global attention away from the \r\nbrutalities being perpetrated by India’s occupation \r\nforce of over half a million troops against innocent and \r\nunarmed Kashmiri children, women and men in Indian-\r\noccupied Jammu and Kashmir. Their call for freedom \r\nhas been met with characteristic Indian brutality.\r\nDuring the past two and a half months, over 100 \r\ninnocent Kashmiris — including infants, children, \r\nwomen and men — have been killed, hundreds blinded \r\nand thousands injured by Indian bullets and pellets. \r\nThis is the worst form of State terrorism — a war crime \r\nthat India has continued to perpetrate in the situation of \r\nforeign occupation in Jammu and Kashmir for the past \r\nmany decades. Pakistan demands a full and impartial \r\ninvestigation of these Indian atrocities and massive \r\nhuman rights violations in Kashmir. We ask that India \r\naccept the investigation proposed by the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and \r\nallow it unfettered access for this purpose.\r\nJammu and Kashmir never was and never can be an \r\nintegral part of India. It is disputed territory, the final \r\nstatus of which has yet to be determined in accordance \r\nwith several resolutions of the Security Council. The \r\nright of the Kashmiri people to self-determination \r\nhas been recognized and promised to them by the \r\nSecurity Council, India and Pakistan. For 70 years \r\nIndia, through force and fraud, has prevented the \r\nKashmiris from exercising this right and from holding \r\nthe United Nations-supervised plebiscite set to enable \r\nthe Kashmiris to determine their political destiny. The \r\nstruggle of the Kashmiri people for self-determination \r\nis a legitimate one, and they have the right to receive \r\nthe moral and political support of the international \r\ncommunity.\r\nThe attack on the Indian army base in Uri, \r\nparticularly its timing, has all the hallmarks of an \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 49/53\r\noperation designed to divert attention from India’s \r\natrocities in occupied Jammu and Kashmir. The \r\ninternational community is well aware that several \r\nsimilar incidents have been staged in the past to serve \r\nIndia’s tactical and propaganda objectives. India is \r\nutilizing the Uri incident to blame Pakistan for the \r\ncurrent Kashmiri uprising and to divert attention \r\nfrom its brutal occupation. India’s Government is \r\ndelusional if it believes that it can isolate any country. \r\nIt is India itself which, because of its war crimes and \r\nwarmongering in Kashmir and elsewhere, is likely to \r\nbe isolated within the international community.\r\nIt is India that has long been a sponsor and \r\npractitioner of State terrorism. Over the course of the \r\npast half-century, India has sponsored and perpetrated \r\nterrorism and aggression against all its neighbours, \r\ncreating terrorist groups, destabilizing and blockading \r\nneighbours to do its strategic bidding, and sponsoring \r\nsubversion, sabotage and terrorism in various parts \r\nof my country. The recently captured Indian spy, \r\nintelligence officer Kulbhushan Yadav, has confessed \r\nto India’s support of such terrorist and subversive \r\nactivities, particularly in the province of Balochistan \r\nand the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Indeed, \r\nit was Kulbhushan who was financing, arming and \r\nsupporting individuals and entities listed under the \r\nUnited Nations sanctions regime. India’s policy of \r\ninterference in Pakistan, especially its attempt to \r\ndestabilize Balochistan, is now a matter of record. This \r\nis a blatant violation of the principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nInstead of aiming to destabilize Pakistan, the \r\nIndian Government would do well to address India’s \r\nown vast internal problems and the dozen or so \r\ninsurgencies occurring in its own country. For the \r\nIndian Foreign Minister to claim that her country has \r\nimposed no preconditions for talks with Pakistan is yet \r\nanother falsehood. It was India that suspended talks \r\nwith Pakistan more than a year ago. It is India that has \r\nrefused to resume them despite repeated offers from \r\nPakistan and advice from the international community. \r\nThe latest offer for talks was made by the Prime \r\nMinister of Pakistan from the rostrum of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nLet us be clear that talks are no favour to Pakistan. \r\nThey are in the interests of both Pakistan and India, \r\nand the people of both countries. Let me reiterate that \r\nPakistan is ready and willing for serious and result-\r\noriented talks with India, with regard in particular to \r\nresolve the outstanding dispute of Jammu and Kashmir, \r\nwhich is imperative for durable peace in our region.\r\nMs. Gambhir (India): In yet another attempt \r\nto divert our attention from her country’s continued \r\nsponsorship of terorrism, today we have heard the \r\nPermanent Representative of Pakistan make a fanciful \r\nand misleading presentation on the situation in the \r\nIndian State of Jammu and Kashmir. At the same time, \r\nwe did not see any attempt by her to answer questions \r\nthat have been posed repeatedly by the international \r\ncommunity to Pakistan.\r\nCan the representative of Pakistan clarify how it is \r\nthat terror sanctuaries and safe havens in her country \r\ncontinue to f lourish despite the Pakistan Army’s much-\r\nvaunted counter-terrorism operations and the billions \r\nof dollars of international counter-terrorism aid it \r\nreceives? Can the representative of Pakistan confirm \r\nthat her country does not use terrorist proxies and \r\nexport terrorism as a matter of State policy? Can the \r\nrepresentative of Pakistan deny that Pakistan, in 2004, \r\nassured that it would not allow any territories under its \r\ncontrol to be used for terror attacks against India? Can \r\nthe representative of Pakistan deny that Pakistan has \r\nfailed to honour the aforementioned assurance, which \r\nwas given at the highest level?\r\nWe have heard today the views of a dysfunctional State \r\nthat inflicts atrocity after atrocity upon its own people \r\nwhile preaching the values of tolerance, democracy \r\nand human rights. We reject these sermons entirely. \r\nOn the other hand, will the representative of Pakistan \r\ndeny that the armed forces of her country committed \r\none of the most extensive and heinous genocides in \r\nhuman history in 1971? Will the representative of \r\nPakistan deny that her country’s armed forces have \r\nrepeatedly used air strikes and artillery against its own \r\npeople? Will the representative of Pakistan explain why \r\nPakistani civil society is being silenced by the plethora \r\nof heavily armed militias that go by such names such as \r\n“Jaish”, meaning “army”; “Lashkar”, meaning “army; \r\n“Sipah”, meaning “soldiers”; and “Harkat”, meaning \r\n“armed movement”?\r\nFinally, it appears that the Representative of \r\nPakistan did not hear clearly what our Minister of \r\nExternal Affairs stated during her address earlier \r\ntoday: “The State of Jammu and Kashmir is an integral \r\npart of India and will always remain so”. We hope that \r\nthe message is loud and clear.\r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n50/53 16-29823\r\nMr. Skinner-Klée (Guatemala) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe would like to exercise our right of reply to the \r\nstatement delivered by the Foreign Minister of Belize in \r\nreference to the territorial, maritime and island dispute \r\nwith my country and recent occurrences in the context \r\nof a 150-year-old conflict. We listened carefully but \r\nin disbelief to the Foreign Minister’s remarks, which \r\ncontained untrue statements.\r\nFirst, we reiterate our commitment to peace and \r\nto a permanent and definitive resolution before the \r\nInternational Court of Justice of a territorial dispute \r\nthat both countries inherited. As was stated in this \r\nforum by the President of the Republic of Guatemala, \r\nMr. Jimmy Morales (see A/71/PV.15), we hope to enjoy \r\na privileged relationship with Belize and an ongoing \r\ndialogue with a view to resolving our shared problems.\r\nGuatemala is a founding Member of the \r\nOrganization, and throughout its membership has \r\nnever resorted to the use or threat of use of force, \r\njust as we have never committed any act against the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. To the contrary, we have sought a peaceful \r\nresolution, in accordance with the principles of justice \r\nand international law, to the dispute that we have \r\nenduredfor more than a century and half. For more than \r\n120 years, Guatemala has done the impossible to reach a \r\npeaceful and mutually beneficial resolution — through \r\ndirect negotiations, mediation and good offices, among \r\nother measures — to the issue of its usurped territory. \r\nHowever, the colonizing Power took advantage of \r\nour good faith by unilaterally granting independence \r\nto Belize in 1981, which once again was contrary to \r\nagreements made.\r\nNotwithstanding the abuse and plundering \r\nGuatemala has suffered, we recognized the right to \r\nself-determination of the people of Belize and their \r\nindependence, but we maintained our legitimate \r\nclaim to our historic rights over part of their territory. \r\nGuatemala has always sought through peaceful means \r\na just, honourable and lasting peace in the name of \r\nthe rights that were taken from us by invasion, force \r\nand deceit. We recognize the existence of the State of \r\nBelize, but we have not renounced our rights, just as we \r\nhave not resorted to violent acts against authorities or \r\ncitizens of our brother country.\r\nToday we are witnessing another kind of \r\nviolence — deplorable behaviour that contravenes the \r\nbonds of friendship that should govern relations among \r\nnations, as prescribed by Article 1 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. This is an obligation that should \r\nbe fulfilled in good faith in order to reach a peaceful \r\nresolution to our territorial, maritime and island \r\ndispute, as also provided for in Article 2 of the Charter.\r\nDespite the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter, over the past decade the lives of defenceless \r\nGuatemalan farmers have been taken by Belizean \r\narms; their only mistake was to come upon areas under \r\nBelizean administration. These are people who never \r\nposed a threat to the security of Belize. Such grave acts \r\nof irrationality and provocation are unjustifiable and \r\nconstitute hostile acts that violate the most basic rules of \r\ncoexistence, and a moral delinquency that jeopardizes \r\nintentional peace and security, causing outrage among \r\na people who long for peace and call for justice and \r\ndecent treatment.\r\nThese violent deaths — including the latest, a \r\n14-year-old boy who died at the hands of irregular armed \r\nforces accompanying the so-called Belize Defence \r\nForce— have all gone unpunished. These are barbaric \r\nacts that are fundamentally hostile and contradict both \r\nthe spirit of the Charter and the inevitable need to \r\npromote harmonious and mutually beneficial relations. \r\nMoreover, they demonstrate irrational behaviour that is \r\nnot legally justifiable.\r\nThe expert report to which the Foreign Minister of \r\nBelize referred does not exonerate Belize, but indicates \r\nthat the shots leading to the death of the boy, Julio \r\nRené Alvarado, were from .22 and .12 calibre weapons. \r\nMembers of the Belizean non-governmental organization \r\nFriends for Conservation and Development, which was \r\nin a joint patrol under the command of the so-called \r\nBelize Defence Force, were carrying those same types \r\nof weapons. Although Guatemala did not object to the \r\ncredentials of the experts, it rejects the content of the \r\nreport due to the inconsistencies presented and the fact \r\nthat there is no documentation of scientific support and \r\nits only backing is the statements of people who were \r\ndirectly involved in the tragic events of the fateful night \r\nof 20 April. This is precisely why such statements have \r\nno merit whatsoever.\r\nIt is irresponsible to claim that elements of the \r\nGuatemalan Armed Forces helped certain citizens to \r\nillegally enter Belize at the place where the incident \r\noccurred so as to destroy evidence that would have \r\nbeen helpful to the investigation. Furthermore, it \r\nshows that Belize did not guard the crime scene, much \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 51/53\r\nless the chain of custody of the evidence. Belize was \r\nresponsible for such tasks, given that the incidents \r\ntook place in territory administered by that country, \r\nthereby naturally compromising the investigation and \r\nits results. Whether or not the boy had been detained, \r\nthe excessive use of force by the joint patrol of Belize \r\nwas no more justified than the six bullet wounds in the \r\nboy’s back or the two lethal shots in the back of his \r\nneck. Similarly, none of the deaths of 10 Guatemalan \r\nfarmers in the Adjacency Zone administered by Belize \r\nwas in any way justifiable.\r\nRegarding the policeman Daniel Conorquie, \r\nwho died in 2014 in the archaeological site known as \r\nCaracol, and the injuries suffered by Staff Sergeant \r\nRichard Lambey in 2016, these acts were committed \r\nby people that entered into Belize from Guatemala. As \r\naffirmed by Foreign Minister Elrington, that does not \r\nmean or prove that the people who perpetrated such \r\nacts are citizens of my country; this is information that \r\nstill has to be investigated.\r\nGuatemala has been patient and conciliatory. For \r\nmore than 150 years, we have had to tolerate the threat, \r\nseizure and treachery of the imperialist Power, to which \r\nmust be added the present violence and false accusation \r\nby those who are playing the victim when really they \r\nare the aggressors. The unauthorized presence of people \r\ndoes not and never will justify the disproportionate and \r\nlethal use of weapons, for any reason whatsoever.\r\nWe regret having to resort to this forum for the first \r\ntime to denounce insidious behaviour that obscures the \r\nreality of the situation. We will continue to seek in \r\ngood faith a solution to our rights in a civilized manner, \r\nguided by the pressing need to find practical solutions \r\nto our shared problems. We will be unrelenting in our \r\nefforts to find a fair solution to this historic dispute, \r\njust as we refuse to abandon our citizens. Rather, we \r\nwill continue our pursuit of an understanding with a \r\nview to promoting the common good and the privilege \r\nof living in peace and harmony.\r\nIn that regard, Guatemala will shortly adhere to \r\nthe Protocol to the Special Agreement that governs \r\nthe simultaneous negotiations, thereby reaffirming \r\nour resolve to submit our territorial, maritime and \r\nisland dispute to the International Court of Justice, the \r\nsupreme body that can and must resolve this age-old \r\nproblem so as to avoid further violent acts that will only \r\nharm both nations.\r\nMr. Yazdani (Iran): I am obliged to take the f loor \r\nin exercise of the right of reply.\r\nThe Foreign Minister of the United Arab Emirates, \r\nin his address to the General Assembly on Saturday \r\n(see A/71/PV.21), reported a number of baseless and \r\nabsurd fabrications against my Government. Those \r\nsame targeted accusations have also been levelled by \r\nthe same and other United Arab Emirates officials on \r\nother occasions, but no effort has ever been made to \r\nsubstantiate them or to provide any proof to support \r\nthem. They are f latly wrong in their thinking that \r\nrepetition may make a claim credible. Conversely, \r\nrepetition makes baseless claims tedious and repulsive.\r\nIt is absurd and hypocritical for the official of a \r\ncountry whose jet fighters are bombing innocent \r\ncivilians in Yemen to accuse Iran of interfering in the \r\ndomestic affairs of other countries. It is also farcical \r\nto witness a regime that, along with certain other \r\naccomplices, has been exporting a host of extremist \r\ntakfiri ideologies for decades, as well as funding and \r\narming terrorists in Iraq, Syria and many other places, \r\ntake the f loor just to accuse Iran of attempting to \r\ndestabilize the region.\r\nThe Emirates official once again assaulted Iran’s \r\nterritorial integrity by repeating a baseless claim to \r\nIran’s three islands in the Persian Gulf. We have always \r\nrejected that falsehood and reiterated that those islands \r\nhave been and continue to be part of Iranian territory. \r\nNo claim, no matter how many times it is repeated, will \r\nbe able in any way to dent or undermine our resolve to \r\nrefute such claims.\r\nMoreover, taken together with the American and \r\nIsraeli representatives’ statements in the Assembly, \r\nwe may better understand the remark in the Israeli \r\nstatement concerning increasing understanding \r\nbetween the Israeli regime and certain regimes in \r\nthe region. In that light, we can understand that the \r\nfocus of the United Arab Emirates statement on Iran \r\nand Iran’s three islands is not a pure coincidence. A \r\nreview of those two statements clearly shows how the \r\ntwo respective regimes have come together and how \r\nthe United Arab Emirates and a few of its partners in \r\nthe Persian Gulf are now uniting with the Israelis — a \r\ncoalition that could only be tantamount to betraying the \r\nPalestinian people.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates official also referred to \r\nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) or, \r\nas he put it, the so-called nuclear agreement. We know \r\nA/71/PV.22 24/09/2016\r\n52/53 16-29823\r\nthat the United Arab Emirates and some of its partners \r\nin the Persian Gulf region did everything in their power \r\nto impede the road to that deal, to no avail. We know \r\nthat after the fruition of the JCPOA, they escalated \r\ntheir provocation against Iran to compensate for the \r\ndétente that the deal brought about. It is unfortunate \r\nthat our efforts to reduce tension in the region are not \r\nreciprocated by them and that they continue to incite \r\nmore tension in the region.\r\nAllow me to also refer briefly to the statement made \r\ntoday by the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Bahrain, \r\nwho also repeated the false claim of Iran’s so-called \r\nintervention in Bahrain’s domestic affairs, which is an \r\nobvious lie. Suffice it to remind him of the report of the \r\nBahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry, set up by \r\nthe Bahraini Government. The Commission’s report, \r\nknown as the Bassiouni report, reads in part:\r\n“The evidence presented to the Commission in \r\nrelation to the involvement of the Islamic Republic \r\nof Iran in the internal affairs of Bahrain does \r\nnot establish a discernible link between specific \r\nincidents that occurred in Bahrain...and the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran”.\r\nHe also referred at length to the Mina disaster of \r\nSeptember 2015 and levelled criticism against Iran, \r\nwhich we reject. With regard to that incident, while the \r\nprecious lives of approximately 500 Iranian pilgrims \r\nperished in the disaster, we rightly expected the Saudis \r\nto adopt a responsible approach, which has never been \r\nthe case up to now. We note with concern that no \r\nfindings from the local investigations of the tragedy, if \r\nany, have yet to be released. Our legitimate request for \r\na thorough, transparent and independent investigation \r\ninto the causes of the tragedy, through a committee \r\nin which the representatives of the affected countries \r\ncould participate, has so far fallen on deaf ears. We \r\nnote that the f lawed management of the hajj pilgrimage \r\nhas caused numerous deadly accidents. Therefore, we \r\nbelieve that effective action should be taken to redress \r\nthe situation.\r\nA few speakers also used false and incorrect terms \r\nto denote the Persian Gulf. We remind them that the \r\ntraditional term “Persian Gulf” has been the correct \r\nappellation for that body of water since 500 years before \r\nChrist and will remain so forever. It is a standardized \r\ngeographic term, recognized by the international \r\ncommunity, including the United Nations, and should \r\nnot be tinkered with due to political projects or the \r\ndaily wishes of this or that ruler.\r\nLast but not least, we have always endeavoured \r\ntowards the removal of tension in our region and \r\ndeveloping friendly and good-neighbourly relations \r\nwith our neighbours, including those in the Persian \r\nGulf. We once more reiterate our interest in, and call for, \r\ndialogue with a view to dispelling misunderstandings \r\nand restoring friendly relations that our people have \r\nmostly enjoyed throughout history.\r\nMs. Rakhmatia (Indonesia): I am compelled to \r\ntake the f loor again in exercise of our right of reply, due \r\nto the response of the delegation of Solomon Islands.\r\nThe remarks delivered earlier by the representative \r\nof Solomon Islands show the use of allegations of \r\nhuman rights violations to support the separatist \r\nmovement, and only reaffirm the persistent violation \r\nof the purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations by blatantly interfering in the affairs, \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of other nations. \r\nIt also demonstrates that country’s representatives’ \r\ncontinuing ignorance of the facts on the ground and \r\nhow they have fallen into the trap of believing trash \r\ninformation peddled by separatist groups.\r\nMr. Munir (Pakistan): We have been forced to take \r\nthe f loor again to respond to the Indian delegation’s \r\ncontinued desire to express falsehoods and fabrications. \r\nWe reject all delusional and false claims and assertions \r\nby the representative of India. Irrespective of how \r\nmany times one repeats a lie, it can never replace the \r\ntruth. The Indian representative seems to have become \r\na victim of her own lies and propaganda.\r\nThe facts of the matter have not changed. Jammu \r\nand Kashmir remains an internationally recognized \r\ndisputed territory. It is a travesty of justice and morality \r\nto stand here in the General Assembly Hall and make \r\nclaims that are against the principles of international \r\nlaw. Indian State-sponsored terrorism continues in \r\noccupied Jammu and Kashmir. Indian occupation \r\nforces are decimating the fundamental human rights \r\nof the hapless Kashmiris and committing a crime \r\nagainst humanity. Indian involvement in sabotage and \r\nsubversive activities in Pakistan is a well-documented \r\nfact. Pakistan’s commitment to fighting terrorism is \r\nrecognized internationally.\r\nLastly, I would reiterate that it seems India has not \r\nheard the voice of the innocent Kashmiri people. They \r\n24/09/2016 A/71/PV.22\r\n16-29823 53/53\r\ndo not want to live under occupation. They have been \r\nsaying that for 70 years, but India only tries to repress \r\nthat unanimous voice. I hope India will wake up to \r\nthe reality.\r\nMs. Gambhir (India): We have patiently listened \r\nto our colleague from Pakistan. He has chosen yet again \r\nto stay silent on the tough questions. That is what we \r\nhave come to expect from Pakistan — deception, deceit \r\nand denial. The world still awaits their response.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the general debate.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to conclude its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 8?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I wish to announce that \r\nthis is the last meeting of the General Assembly \r\nfor Ms. Emma Pioche, Conference Officer in the \r\nDepartment for General Assembly and Conference \r\nManagement. Ms. Pioche, seen by all and known to \r\nmany, has worked at the United Nations for 36 years, a \r\nmajority of which have been associated with the work \r\nof the General Assembly plenary. Her contribution to \r\nthe smooth running of Assembly meetings has been \r\ntruly significant, and I would like the Assembly to give \r\nher a round of applause in appreciation. We wish her \r\nall the best.\r\nThe meeting rose at 2.35 p.m.\r\n"
