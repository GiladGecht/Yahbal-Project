The Fifth Committee adopted \r\nthe draft resolution, entitled “Scale of assessments \r\nfor the apportionment of the expenses of the United \r\nNations”, without a vote. May I take it that the Assembly \r\nwishes to do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 71/2).\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthis stage of its consideration of agenda item 138.\r\nElection of the Chairs of the Main Committees\r\nThe President: Members will recall that for \r\nthe seventy-first session, the President, the 21 \r\nVice-Presidents and the Chairpersons of the First \r\nCommittee, the Special Political and Decolonization \r\nCommittee and the Second, Third and Sixth Committees \r\nwere elected on 13 June. There remained the election of \r\nthe Chairperson of the Fifth Committee, to take place \r\nat a later date.\r\nI should now like to inform members that Her \r\nExcellency Ms. Inga Rhonda King of Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines was elected Chairperson of the \r\nFifth Committee on 29 September and is accordingly \r\na member of the General Committee for the seventy-\r\nfirst session. I congratulate the Chairperson of the Fifth \r\nCommittee on her election.\r\nThe Chairpersons of the six Main Committees \r\nand the 21 Vice-Presidents having been elected, the \r\nGeneral Committee of the General Assembly for the \r\nseventy-first session has thus been fully constituted in \r\naccordance with rule 38 of the rules of procedure.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.40 a.m.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.
