"United Nations A/71/PV.25\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n25th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 6 October 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 7 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items\r\nDocumentation for the election of the members \r\nof the International Law Commission: review of \r\nthe list of candidates\r\nThe President: I would like to consult the General \r\nAssembly on a matter concerning sub-item (b) of \r\nagenda item 114 on the election of the members of \r\nthe International Law Commission, which has been \r\nscheduled to take place on Thursday, 3 November.\r\nOn that day, the Assembly will proceed to the \r\nelection of 34 members of the Commission, whose \r\nterms of office are to commence on 1 January 2017. It \r\nshould be recalled that, in accordance with the statute \r\nof the International Law Commission, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral communicated to the Governments of Member \r\nStates, in document A/71/90, the list of candidates \r\nsubmitted within the required time for the submission \r\nof nominations — that is, by 1 June 2016. In documents \r\nA/71/90/Add.1 to A/71/90/Add.4, the Secretary-General \r\ninformed the Assembly of developments concerning \r\ncandidates, including new candidates and withdrawals, \r\nsince the issuance of document A/71/90. The statements \r\nof qualifications of the candidates are contained in \r\nA/71/83 and Add. 1.\r\nIn these circumstances, it is necessary for the \r\nGeneral Assembly to take a decision as to whether the \r\nnew candidatures should be accepted in spite of the \r\nsubmission of their names subsequent to the deadline \r\nand whether they should be incorporated into a \r\nconsolidated list of candidates.\r\nIt has been the practice of the Assembly to \r\nincorporate such late submissions into a consolidated \r\nlist. If I hear no objection, may I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to request the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to issue such a consolidated list of candidates?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda items 120 and 121\r\nImplementation of the resolutions of the \r\nUnited Nations\r\nRevitalization of the work of the General Assembly\r\nThe President: The American writer Mark Twain \r\nonce observed that “continuous improvement is better \r\nthan delayed perfection”. It is a message of particular \r\nrelevance to Member States in our ongoing efforts to \r\nrevitalize the work of the General Assembly.\r\n Since 1991, the United Nations membership has \r\nsought to enhance the role, authority, effectiveness and \r\nefficiency of the General Assembly through discussion \r\nunder the agenda item “Revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly”. It is critical, incremental work \r\nthat requires a deep commitment to the ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations and a dedication to working to improve \r\nthe Organization’s ability to fulfil its mandate under \r\nthe Charter.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

I would \r\nlike to thank them for their hard work and leadership \r\nas co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly \r\nthat led to these outcomes.\r\nThe inclusion in resolution 69/321 of details on \r\nthe process to select and appoint the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral have transformed and significantly enhanced \r\nthe legitimacy of that process. The way in which the \r\nprocess was conducted has vindicated the good work \r\ndone by the Ad Hoc Working Group. I would like to \r\npay particular tribute in this regard to my predecessor, \r\nMr. Mogens Lykketoft. Furthermore, the inclusion in \r\nresolution 70/305 of an oath of office, a code of ethics \r\nand a series of other measures relating to the President \r\nof the General Assembly were particularly prescient \r\ndevelopments. I am honoured to be the first President \r\nof the General Assembly to begin the term of office \r\nby undertaking to fulfil the commitments embedded \r\nin these documents, as well as to foster a General \r\nAssembly based on ethics, transparency, inclusiveness \r\nand effectiveness.\r\nAs milestones in the revitalization agenda, \r\nresolutions 69/321 and 70/305 have already impacted \r\nthe work of the Assembly in significant ways, and \r\nI would like to touch briefly upon some of these \r\nkey developments.\r\nThe importance of close cooperation and \r\ncoordination between the Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly, the Security Council and the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, as well as with the Secretary-General, \r\nwas emphasized in resolution 70/305. This is an essential \r\ndevelopment for the efficiency and effectiveness of \r\nthe United Nations, particularly as it prepares for the \r\ntask of supporting the implementation of the ambitious \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I am deeply \r\ncommitted to doing my part in implementing these \r\nprovisions. To strengthen transparency and improve \r\ncoherence across the work of the United Nations \r\nsystem, I have undertaken to inform member States \r\nabout each of my monthly meetings with the Presidents \r\nof the Security Council and the Economic and Social \r\nCouncil, as well as with the Secretary-General, and the \r\nscope of the discussions held.\r\nGeneral Assembly thematic debates continue to be \r\nan important mechanism for member States to discuss \r\nissues of critical importance to the membership. I \r\nhave, however, heard clearly the concerns expressed \r\nby many delegations at the proliferation of such \r\ndebates — mandated or otherwise — over recent years. \r\nI therefore plan, during the seventy-first session, to \r\nminimize the number of such events and to look at \r\ncreative ways to ensure that Member States and other \r\nstakeholders are able to consider the pressing issues of \r\nthe day in the most effective and efficient way.\r\nThe decision to move the timing of elections for \r\nnon-permanent members of the Security Council \r\nto around six months prior to elected members \r\ncommencing their roles was implemented for the first \r\ntime earlier this year. This is a practice that has already \r\nbeen commended by those recently elected members as \r\na positive development that will help to facilitate their \r\nsmooth assumption of responsibilities.\r\nAs regards working methods, I intend to continue \r\nmy close cooperation with the Chairs of the Main \r\nCommittees to ensure the effectiveness and efficiency \r\nof the work of those Committees, as well as to enhance \r\nsynergy and coherence and reduce potential overlapping \r\nin the agendas of the General Assembly and its Main \r\nCommittees, the Economic and Social Council and other \r\nrelated forums, particularly in the light of the adoption \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nIn this regard, I acknowledge that significant work \r\nwas undertaken during the seventieth session on the \r\nalignment of the General Assembly agenda with the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. This was \r\na process led ably by Ambassador María Emma Mejía \r\nVélez of Colombia, and supported by the Chairs of \r\nthe First and Second Committees and the President of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council. I look forward to \r\ndiscussing ways to build on these efforts with Member \r\nStates over the coming session.\r\nWith respect to the General Assembly itself, I \r\nwill be encouraging the incoming Chairs of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group to consider ways to strengthen \r\nits integrity. In my view, this includes exploring ways \r\nto preserve decorum and the special place of the \r\ngeneral debate on the calendar of world leaders and \r\nthe Organization, and to further improve the overall \r\npreparation for and effectiveness of this high-level \r\n06/10/2016 A/71/PV.25\r\n16-31169 3/14\r\nweek. For example, the wisdom of burdening ourselves \r\nwith four official high-level meetings in the course of \r\nthe general debate is something that deserves serious \r\nconsideration. In addition, I would like the focus that \r\nwas placed on ethics during the seventieth session to \r\nbe extended to the overall decision-making processes, \r\nincluding in terms of the ethical dimension of elections \r\nfor positions and roles at the United Nations.\r\nIn the matter of the selection and appointment \r\nof the next Secretary-General, recent developments \r\nhave already received significant attention and will \r\ncontinue to be high on the agenda during the seventy-\r\nfirst session. I look forward over the coming days \r\nto bringing the appointment process to an orderly \r\nconclusion and to facilitating a smooth transition and \r\na strong start for the next Secretary-General. This \r\nincludes promptly bringing Member States and the \r\nSecretary-General-designate together to enable them \r\nto engage in substantive dialogues on issues such as \r\nthe appointment of senior officials or the reform of \r\nthe Secretariat. Throughout this process, I have tasked \r\ntwo special advisers from my Office with engaging \r\nin consultations with Member States and interested \r\ngroups. They will be advising me on the best way \r\nforward. Following the finalization of the selection and \r\nappointment process for the next Secretary-General, \r\nthere will be many lessons to be learned and considered \r\nby the Ad Hoc Working Group.\r\nResolutions 69/321 and 70/305 provide solid \r\nground for future deliberations to enhance the \r\nprocess, including ways to strengthen the role of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to enhance transparency and \r\naccountability of the process.\r\nFinally, efforts to strengthen the accountability, \r\ntransparency and institutional memory of the Office \r\nof the President of the General Assembly are already \r\nenhancing the functioning of the Office of the President \r\nof the General Assembly. In addition to the oath of \r\noffice and the code of ethics, as part of my commitment \r\nto transparency, I have undertaken to ensure that all \r\nfinancial support to the Office will be channelled \r\nthrough the United Nations Trust Fund, where all \r\nsources of funds and expenditures will be subjected to \r\npublic scrutiny. I also intend to ensure that at the end of \r\nthe seventy-first session, the records and institutional \r\nmemory of the President of the General Assembly’s \r\nOffice will be preserved by the United Nations record-\r\nkeeping and archiving facilities, and that a handover \r\nsummary of best practices and lessons learned will be \r\nmade available to all Member States.\r\nI am acutely aware of the importance of a smooth \r\ntransition between General Assembly presidencies, \r\nwhich can be made difficult by calendar arrangements \r\nand other factors. Among other issues, we therefore \r\nneed to look carefully at the timing of the transition in \r\norder to enable the incoming President of the General \r\nAssembly enough time in office to ensure that the \r\nweek of high-level meetings runs as efficiently as \r\npossible. I look forward to discussing, in due course, \r\nways to improve continuity and transitions further \r\nwith the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of the General Assembly. I would also \r\nlike to thank Member States once again, as well as \r\nthe Secretariat — particularly the Department for \r\nGeneral Assembly and Conference Management — and \r\nthe United Nations specialized agencies, funds and \r\nprogrammes for their support of the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, including through \r\nsecondments of staff.\r\nMuch important work lies ahead for all of us in \r\nour efforts to strengthen and revitalize the General \r\nAssembly and to ensure its role as the pre-eminent \r\ndeliberative, policymaking and representative organ \r\nof the United Nations. The General Assembly’s central \r\nrole in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development is paramount, and we need to \r\nensure that we too are essentially fit for purpose. I am \r\ncurrently looking to appoint co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in order to enable it to continue its \r\nimportant work during the seventy-first session. I look \r\nforward to the Assembly’s continued active contribution \r\nto the process in the work ahead.\r\nI now call on the observer of the European Union.\r\nMr. Van Den Akker (European Union): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\nand its member States. The candidate countries the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization \r\nand Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine, the Republic \r\nof Moldova and Georgia, align themselves with \r\nmy statement.\r\nI wish to thank you, Sir, for convening today’s \r\nplenary meeting. We look forward to working with you \r\nin the negotiations on resolutions throughout the coming \r\nA/71/PV.25 06/10/2016\r\n4/14 16-31169\r\nweeks and months. I would like to thank the President \r\nof the Assembly at its seventieth session, Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft, for his oversight of and engagement in the \r\nGeneral Assembly revitalization process. I would also \r\nlike to extend my sincerest gratitude to the previous \r\nco-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly, \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia, \r\nMr. Vladimir Drobnjak and Mr. Wilfried Emvula, \r\nfor their excellent work. We wish the new co-Chairs \r\nsuccess for the coming year and express our support \r\nfor the upcoming work, in the hope of continuing the \r\nsignificant progress made in the last session.\r\nThe two most recent resolutions on the revitalization \r\nof the work of the General Assembly have been \r\nground-breaking. Resolution 69/321 paved the way \r\nfor a more transparent Secretary-General selection \r\nprocess this year, which has improved the public \r\nimage and accountability of the United Nations. This \r\nlandmark year’s selection process has almost finished \r\nand, in that regard, we look forward to the General \r\nAssembly plenary session next week. We are grateful \r\nto you, Mr. President, for the nomination of two special \r\nadvisers, Ambassador Ioannis Vrailas and Ambassador \r\nSofia Borges, to facilitate the outcome of the process.\r\nResolution 70/305 also contains significant \r\nnew elements that strengthen the accountability, \r\ntransparency and institutional memory of the Office of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly. In particular, \r\nthey include the release of detailed information on \r\nthe finances, official travel, staffing and activities of \r\nthe Office of the President, the release of a written \r\nhandover summary of best practices and lessons \r\nlearned to the President’s successor and to Member \r\nStates in a standardized format, and the preservation \r\nof records and institutional memory during the \r\nPresident’s term in office by using existing record-\r\nkeeping and archiving facilities. Also noteworthy in \r\nresolution 70/305 is the agreement on the release of \r\nfinancial disclosures on assumption and completion of \r\nthe President’s duties, in line with the existing United \r\nNations financial disclosure programme. In addition, \r\nwe agree that all contributions should be vetted through \r\nthe United Nations Ethics Office and that non-in-kind \r\ncontributions should be channelled through the United \r\nNations Trust Fund.\r\nParticular progress was also made in other areas, \r\nsuch as the establishment of a code of ethics to be \r\nobserved by the President, including the members of \r\nhis or her Office, and of an individual oath of office, as \r\nwe already witnessed a few weeks ago when you, Mr \r\nPresident, assumed the position. That is complemented \r\nby the decision to enhance cooperation and interaction \r\nbetween the permanent missions and the Secretariat \r\nthrough an interactive and comprehensive dialogue. \r\nAnother aspect worth highlighting is the new progress \r\nin efforts to create equal opportunities for men and \r\nwomen and to ensure a gender balance throughout \r\nthe United Nations system and in the Office of the \r\nPresident. All these and other elements agreed upon \r\nin the recently adopted resolution will ensure that the \r\npublic image of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nOffice of the President, are enhanced.\r\nEffective multilateralism, with the United Nations \r\nat its core, remains key. Our top priorities remain the \r\nstrengthening of the Organization, based on effective \r\nand sustainable funding that is in line with real capacity \r\nto pay; and increasing the efficiency of its functioning, \r\nan area in which there is scope to do more. In that \r\ncontext, we continue to be committed to revitalization \r\nand to supporting efforts aimed at strengthening the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly, in line with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and relevant resolutions. \r\nThat is especially needed in the context of the global \r\nchallenges the world is facing today. At the same time, \r\nwe wish to reiterate that it is imperative for concrete \r\nsteps to be taken at all levels, with a view to spending \r\nmore wisely, delivering in new ways and ensuring that \r\nthe Organization functions within the agreed budget \r\nlevels. An unceasing effort to find new and creative \r\nways to work is essential if we are to achieve a more \r\neffective delivery of mandates and the sustainable use \r\nof resources.\r\nWe believe that revitalization can be ensured only \r\nwhen the General Assembly takes relevant action \r\non issues of common concern to the international \r\ncommunity and produces results. By doing so, it lives \r\nup to its role as one of the principal organs of the United \r\nNations. The revitalization of the work of the General \r\nAssembly is clearly pivotal for the overall reform of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nFocusing on the negotiations ahead of us, we believe \r\nthat this session’s resolutions should aim to consolidate \r\nthe work achieved so far, and we remain committed to \r\nworking to improve the efficiency and effectiveness \r\nof the functioning of the General Assembly. In that \r\nregard, enhancing the role of the General Committee \r\nto support the work of the General Assembly could \r\n06/10/2016 A/71/PV.25\r\n16-31169 5/14\r\nbe helpful and needs to be further explored. Further \r\nstreamlining of the work of the different committees \r\nand of the relationship between the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly is still needed.\r\nFinally, let me emphasize the important role of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly. I would like to assure \r\nyou that the European Union and its member States will \r\ncontinue to constructively engage in the proceedings of \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group.\r\nMr. Bessedik (Algeria): I thank you, Sir, for all \r\nyour efforts concerning the sensitive issue of the \r\nrevitalization of the work of the General Assembly.\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries (NAM).\r\nLet me first thank the co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly, the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Croatia and Namibia, for having achieved \r\npositive outcomes at its previous two sessions. The \r\nNon-Aligned Movement underlines the importance of \r\nthe revitalization of the work of the General Assembly \r\nas a political process rather than a procedural matter, \r\naimed mainly at strengthening the role of the General \r\nAssembly as the chief deliberative, policymaking \r\nand representative organ of the United Nations in the \r\nwider United Nations system. The process should \r\ntherefore be conducted in an inclusive, transparent and \r\nefficient manner. A reinvigorated General Assembly \r\nin a more responsive environment, fully exerting its \r\nrole and authority, would significantly contribute to \r\nthe strengthening of the wider United Nations system, \r\nthe improvement of international governance and the \r\nenhancement of multilateralism.\r\nA thorough evaluation of the status of the \r\nimplementation of the General Assembly resolutions \r\non this issue and a clear identification of the causes \r\ndelaying implementation are of the utmost importance, \r\nso that constraints can be progressively eliminated and \r\nthe revitalization of the General Assembly can achieve \r\nits full potential. The Movement stresses the importance \r\nof implementing the General Assembly resolutions on \r\na non-selective basis, including the provisions related \r\nto the revitalization of its work that require follow-up \r\nor further action, as indicated in the inventory chart. It \r\nis worth highlighting that the implementation of some \r\nprovisions depends on the political will of all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations. In that context, we \r\nreaffirm the role and authority of the General Assembly, \r\nincluding on questions related to international peace \r\nand security, and its intergovernmental, inclusive \r\nand democratic character, which have immensely \r\ncontributed to the promotion of the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations and the \r\nachievement of United Nations goals. NAM reaffirms \r\nthe intergovernmental nature of the United Nations \r\nand draws attention to the need to consult all Member \r\nStates about the initiatives and activities undertaken \r\nwithin the Organization.\r\nIn a context of increased global challenges, the \r\nMovement reaffirms that the role of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is one of the most important and challenging in \r\nthe world. His appointment should be more transparent \r\nand democratic and should include all Member States \r\nthrough the effective participation of the General \r\nAssembly in the selection and appointment process. \r\nIn a letter dated 13 September, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft \r\nexpressed his hope that the General Assembly would \r\nbe able to reach a decision — whether through the \r\ndesignation of co-facilitators or not — on drafting a \r\nconsensus resolution appointing the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral and that, upon receiving the recommendation \r\nfrom the Security Council, the appointment draft \r\nresolution could be adopted in a timely manner in \r\norder to give the next Secretary-General enough time \r\nto prepare. He also expressed the hope — which we \r\necho — that it will be possible to further consolidate and \r\nentrench the principles of transparency and inclusivity.\r\nIn its statement with regard to the informal meeting \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization \r\nof the Work of the General Assembly on 29 August, \r\nNAM reiterated once again that the process of selection \r\nand appointment of the new Secretary-General by \r\nthe General Assembly — one of the most significant \r\nongoing issues addressed by the United Nations this \r\nyear — should be carried out in full compliance with \r\nthe General Assembly’s mandate. These include the \r\nAssembly’s consideration of the draft resolution, which \r\nshould be preceded by wide and extensive consultations \r\nwith all States Members of the United Nations, and its \r\nvoting by secret ballot on the recommendation of the \r\nSecurity Council in conformity with rule 141 of the \r\nrules of procedure of the General Assembly.\r\nIn the light of the latest developments in connection \r\nwith the selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, NAM continues to call upon the Security \r\nCouncil to consider, not only now but in the future, \r\nA/71/PV.25 06/10/2016\r\n6/14 16-31169\r\nthe possibility whereby more than one candidacy is \r\nendorsed and submitted to the General Assembly in \r\nthe interest of selecting the best possible candidate \r\nfrom among those possessing and displaying, inter \r\nalia, commitment to the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter, extensive leadership and administrative and \r\ndiplomatic experience.\r\nFurthermore, NAM calls on the Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council to continue \r\nto hold timely informal meetings for an exchange of \r\nviews on the ongoing process of the selection and \r\nappointment of the future Secretary-General. In the \r\ncourse of the identification and appointment of the best \r\nperson for the post of Secretary-General, including from \r\namong women candidates, due regard shall continue to \r\nbe given to regional rotation and also to gender equality, \r\nas stipulated in paragraph 38 of resolution 69/321 and \r\nin paragraph 59 of resolution 51/241. We should not \r\nforget that it is up to the General Assembly to select \r\nand appoint the Secretary-General, and it is up to the \r\nGeneral Assembly to decide upon the recommendation \r\nof the Security Council.\r\nWe also believe that prevailing practices in the \r\nelection of executive heads elsewhere in the United \r\nNations system could be suitable for the appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General. We therefore recommend \r\nconsidering existing practices. Moreover, NAM \r\nwould like to emphasize the issue of promises made \r\nby candidates in exchange for the support of the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, which is \r\ndescribed in the report of the Joint Inspection Unit for \r\n2011 (A/66/34).\r\nWe consider that no Member State should have \r\na privileged position in this matter. It is therefore \r\nimportant that candidates not be pressured, either \r\nbefore or after being appointed, into giving posts in \r\nthe Secretariat to people of any particular nationality \r\nin return for political support, since that is clearly \r\ncontrary to the spirit of the Charter. The selection of the \r\nnew Secretary-General will test our capacity to live up \r\nto the ethical standard required. The General Assembly \r\nmust not be left out of the picture or merely be asked to \r\nrubber-stamp decisions taken by the Security Council.\r\nWhile we recognize the role of the Security Council, \r\nwe look forward to a new form of positive cooperation, \r\nwith broader acceptance and efficiency of the missions \r\nand functions of the Secretary-General. That issue, \r\none of utmost importance to all of us, was raised in \r\ntwo letters sent to the President, the first on behalf \r\nof NAM, dated 29 June 2016, the second on behalf \r\nof the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\ngroup, dated 18 May 2016. On 29 August, a meeting \r\nwas organized by the co-Chairs to explore those issues \r\nwith the membership, in response to the invitation of \r\nthe President. We hope that the process of consultation \r\nwill continue throughout the negotiations on the draft \r\nresolution appointing the Secretary-General.\r\nWe take this opportunity to request further \r\nclarifications from the President on the next steps \r\nand the necessary preparatory procedures to organize \r\nbroad, transparent and inclusive consultations with \r\nall Member States before submitting the resolution on \r\nthe selection and appointment of the tenth Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nMs. Kasese-Bota (Zambia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express our \r\nappreciation for the fact that resolution 70/305, the \r\nmost recent on the revitalization of the work of \r\nthe General Assembly, was adopted by consensus. \r\nNevertheless, we have to emphatically recall that our \r\nGroup has always shown great f lexibility, even when \r\nwe had misgivings. We hope that our concerns will be \r\nfully taken into consideration during the next round of \r\nnegotiations — which normally should have a positive \r\noutcome — on the submission of a draft resolution \r\nconcerning the selection and appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General and its adoption by the Assembly in \r\na transparent, democratic manner.\r\nWe note that we have repeatedly emphasized some \r\nissues. We will continue to do so until we have achieved \r\nour objectives.\r\nMr. Phansourivong (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\ncomprising 10 member States: Brunei Darussalam, \r\nCambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, the \r\nPhilippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my \r\nown country, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.\r\nAt the outset, let me congratulate Mr. Vladimir \r\nDrobnjak, Permanent Representative of Croatia, and \r\nMr. Wilfried Emvula, Permanent Representative of \r\nNamibia, on their excellent work as co-Chairs of the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work \r\nof the General Assembly. ASEAN warmly welcomes \r\n06/10/2016 A/71/PV.25\r\n16-31169 7/14\r\nthe progress made during their co-chairmanship, as \r\nreflected in resolution 70/305, which was adopted by \r\nconsensus on 13 September. ASEAN would also like \r\nto express its appreciation to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventieth \r\nsession, for his commitment and effort in moving \r\nforward the agenda on the revitalization of the work \r\nof the General Assembly, especially his commitment to \r\ntransparency and openness.\r\nASEAN would like to take this opportunity once \r\nagain to congratulate the President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson. ASEAN firmly believes that, under his \r\nleadership, the process of revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly will yield more positive results.\r\nASEAN is pleased with the implementation of \r\nresolution 69/321, on the process of the selection \r\nand appointment of the next Secretary-General, \r\nparticularly the holding of informal dialogues between \r\nthe candidates and the General Assembly, which has \r\nprovided an opportunity for candidates to interact with \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations. Moving \r\nforward, ASEAN believes that the agreement reached \r\nin resolution 70/305 should be implemented faithfully \r\nto provide for a transparent and inclusive selection \r\nprocess that would ensure that the best possible \r\ncandidate is selected for the post of Secretary-General.\r\nIt is important that Member States be provided with \r\nan opportunity to further reinvigorate and revitalize \r\nthe United Nations. ASEAN believes that revitalization \r\nwill make the Organization more effective, transparent \r\nand inclusive, and thereby better equipped to respond \r\nto the needs of Member States. We should all work \r\ntogether to make the General Assembly play its role as \r\nthe chief deliberative, policymaking and representative \r\norgan of the United Nations.\r\nASEAN welcomes the reaffirmation in resolution \r\n70/305 of the importance and benefit of interaction \r\nbetween the General Assembly and international or \r\nregional forums and organizations dealing with global \r\nmatters of concern to the international community. \r\nASEAN takes note of the report to the General \r\nAssembly on the strategic alignment of future sessions \r\nof the General Assembly with the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nASEAN recognizes that complementarities exist \r\nbetween the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the ASEAN Community Vision 2025. We also \r\nrecognize the importance of dialogue and cooperation \r\nbetween ASEAN and the United Nations in taking \r\nforward the work on enhancing such complementarities, \r\nas reflected in the ASEAN-United Nations Plan of \r\nAction 2016-2020.\r\nASEAN stands ready to support the strengthening of \r\nthe institutional memory of the Office of the President. \r\nThe relevant provisions of resolution 70/305 should be \r\nfully implemented. ASEAN expresses its thanks and \r\nappreciation to those Member States that have seconded \r\ntheir nationals to the Office of the President. ASEAN is \r\npleased about the adoption of the code of ethics and oath \r\nof office by the General Assembly this year as a means \r\nto reinforce transparency, accountability and the moral \r\nand ethical integrity of the President and his Office.\r\nIn conclusion, ASEAN reaffirms its commitment to \r\nengage effectively and constructively with all Member \r\nStates in order to ensure the successful outcome of the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group session on revitalizing the work \r\nof the General Assembly. We are confident that, with \r\nthe political goodwill of all Member States, we will be \r\nable to reach consensus and achieve concrete outcomes.\r\nMs. Abdullah (Malaysia): At the outset, I wish \r\nto congratulate the Permanent Representatives of \r\nCroatia and of Namibia, co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group on the Revitalization of the Work of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session. I join \r\nother colleagues in extending our appreciation for \r\ntheir excellent stewardship and leadership, and the \r\ncommitment shown by all concerned in enabling the \r\nAd Hoc Working Group to make greater progress \r\ntowards our common goal of revitalizing the General \r\nAssembly in all its aspects, including its role, authority, \r\neffectiveness and efficiency.\r\nMy delegation is encouraged by the recent adoption \r\nof resolution 70/305, entitled “Revitalization of the work \r\nof the General Assembly”, and that of its predecessor, \r\nresolution 69/321. Malaysia aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nLaos on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asia \r\nNations (ASEAN).\r\nUnited Nations reform, particularly revitalization \r\nof the work of the General Assembly, remains an \r\nimportant annual agenda item for all the members of \r\nthat body. My delegation appreciates the updated annex \r\nto the report of the Ad Hoc Working Group (A/70/1003), \r\nwhich has enabled Member States to keep abreast of \r\nthe implementation of the previous resolutions on \r\nA/71/PV.25 06/10/2016\r\n8/14 16-31169\r\nrevitalization. We welcome the efforts made by the \r\nSecretariat in providing such updates, which have \r\nprovided Member States with a better understanding of \r\nthe reasons behind any lack of implementation of the \r\nresolutions. While the ongoing review of the inventory \r\nof resolutions on revitalization is a step in the right \r\ndirection, the process should not stop there. Without a \r\ndoubt, the next logical step is to find ways to address \r\nthe underlying causes and remove any constraints, \r\nthereby paving the way for the eventual implementation \r\nof the resolutions.\r\nMalaysia is of the view that we should persevere \r\nin our collective effort to ensure that the General \r\nAssembly remains the chief deliberative, policymaking \r\nand representative organ of the United Nations. It is the \r\nhighest authoritative body of the United Nations in that \r\nit represents all 193 Member States.\r\nWe welcome the General Assembly’s continuing \r\nsupport in enhancing United Nations interactions with \r\ninternational, regional and subregional organizations \r\nsuch as ASEAN and the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries on various global issues. Malaysia will work \r\nclosely with other Member States in discussing the \r\ndrafting of the proposed resolution on the appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General in a timely manner and in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nmandates and other relevant appointment procedures.\r\nFinally, I wish to reiterate my delegation’s \r\ncommitment to working constructively with all Member \r\nStates in ensuring that the General Assembly maintains \r\nits role as the principal policymaking and norm-setting \r\norgan of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Iliichev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We welcome today’s meeting of the General \r\nAssembly on the revitalization of its work. We support \r\nrealistic initiatives to increase the effectiveness of the \r\nAssembly’s work in many ways that can be achieved \r\nby improving its working methods and streamlining \r\nits agenda, which is now seriously burdened. We \r\npresume that there is a need to continue the transition to \r\nconsidering some agenda items on a two- or three-year \r\nbasis and removing those items that are no longer \r\ntimely.\r\nWe endorse the proposal to unburden the high-\r\nlevel week, particularly the general debate, because \r\nwhen Heads of State and Government and Ministers for \r\nForeign Affairs are in New York, they already have a \r\nfull timetable of bilateral contacts. It would be sensible \r\nto limit the number of high-level events at that time. \r\nThose remaining should be spread throughout the \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nIt goes without saying that any attempt to carry out \r\nreforms should be based on strict compliance with the \r\ndistribution of prerogatives among the principal organs \r\nof the United Nations, as set out in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Security Council is today completing the \r\nprocess of selecting a new Secretary-General. The \r\ncandidacy of António Guterres has been recommended \r\nto the General Assembly for its consideration. \r\nResolution 69/321 introduced a range of new elements \r\ninto the procedure for selecting the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral, and the recently adopted resolution 70/305 \r\nstrengthened them. Russia played an active role in \r\ntheir coordination.\r\nWe are prepared to engage in further constructive \r\nwork to optimize existing procedures with the \r\ninvolvement of all Member States. All ideas are \r\nworthy of careful consideration. Having said that, we \r\nmust not forget that our main objective is for the post \r\nof Secretary-General to be held by the most worthy \r\ncandidate. The introduction of new initiatives not based \r\non consensus may lead to divisions in the General \r\nAssembly and seriously complicate the process for the \r\nselection and appointment of a new Secretary-General \r\nthat is already under way. We are not, therefore, ready \r\nto support any proposal to enact further changes in the \r\nexisting procedure.\r\nThe same applies to the preparation of the \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution on the appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General. We are opposed to attempts \r\nto load that document with controversial political \r\nelements when it is essentially a technical document. \r\nFurthermore, lengthy discussions on the draft might \r\nlead to a delay in the appointment of Mr. Ban Ki-moon’s \r\nsuccessor, which would be unwelcome from a political \r\nperspective and would hardly help the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral to familiarize himself with all aspects of the \r\nwork of the Organization.\r\nIn considering the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, we hear criticisms of the Security Council, \r\nincluding the suggestion that at times it impinges on the \r\nprerogatives of other United Nations bodies. We share \r\nsuch concerns. Our Council colleagues are certainly \r\naware of our hesitancy about proposals that the Security \r\nCouncil should consider thematic subjects, especially \r\n06/10/2016 A/71/PV.25\r\n16-31169 9/14\r\ngeneric ones. We believe that the Council should focus \r\non country-based subjects and on issues regarding \r\nwhich it can and should take specific decisions.\r\nWe note that at times the Security Council holds \r\nopen debates that do not directly relate to issues \r\nconcerning the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. We are sometimes of the impression that the \r\nGeneral Assembly has in fact moved into the Security \r\nCouncil Chamber. We believe that debates of that nature \r\nshould take place in the General Assembly, where all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations can speak on an \r\nequal footing. That would give the revitalization of the \r\nGeneral Assembly an additional chance of success.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): Croatia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered on behalf of the European \r\nUnion. I will make some brief additional remarks on \r\nthe issue at hand.\r\nFirst and foremost, I am confident that I also \r\nspeak for Ambassador Emvula of Namibia, my \r\nvalued co-Chair of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly, \r\nwhen I say that we were deeply honoured to facilitate \r\nsuch a vital, important and far-reaching process during \r\nboth the sixty-ninth and seventieth sessions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly. We have truly enjoyed two fruitful \r\nyears of deliberations in the Ad Hoc Working Group, \r\nand we express once again our appreciation for being \r\nentrusted with such an important task.\r\nHaving before us the very tangible results \r\nembodied in resolutions 69/321 and 70/305, resolutions \r\nthat more than once have been referred to as milestone \r\ndocuments, we can state with certainty that we have \r\nindeed proved what can be achieved when there is a \r\nwillingness on the part of all Member States to engage \r\nin a thorough, substantive debate on numerous crucial \r\naspects of the issue of General Assembly revitalization. \r\nAnd through those resolutions the value of consensus \r\nonce again proved to be pivotal.\r\nNotable advances were most definitely made in \r\nsome key domains of the work of the Organization, in \r\nparticular those related to the selection and appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General, and to increasing the \r\nefficiency, transparency and accountability of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Office of its President. How \r\ndo we see this being implemented in practice? Let me \r\ngive a couple of noteworthy examples.\r\nSeveral days ago, the handover report of the \r\noutgoing President was circulated to Member States. \r\nAnd we recently witnessed a historic moment when the \r\nincoming President of the Assembly took the oath of \r\noffice in this very Hall. We are in the very final stages \r\nof the selection and appointment of the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral, a process that for the first time, was conducted \r\nin an open and inclusive manner, in accordance with \r\nresolution 69/321. Some issues were successfully \r\naddressed and provided with appropriate, effective \r\nsolutions. On the other hand, some issues are still to be \r\naddressed properly and inclusively during this session \r\nand beyond.\r\nI believe we established in our previous deliberations \r\nthat the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of \r\nthe General Assembly serves as an important platform \r\nfor exchanging views on pivotal parts of reform \r\nprocesses and for exploring their potential scope and \r\ndepth. Even when it is not possible to reach consensus \r\non certain elements, it is beyond doubt that the entire \r\nmembership profits considerably from such exchanges \r\nof views. The Working Group should therefore continue \r\nto address various issues of interest with a view to \r\ndeepening our understanding on different positions and \r\nto try to bring them closer together.\r\nIt should also be noted that during the seventieth \r\nsession, the Ad Hoc Working Group invited members of \r\nthe Secretariat on several occasions to provide Member \r\nStates with additional information and answers to \r\nsome pertinent questions on the issues at hand. The \r\ninteractive dialogue with the Secretariat proved to be \r\nvery useful and mutually beneficial, and it stands out \r\nas a practice that is certainly worth following in the \r\nfuture. In that regard, to give just one example, the issue \r\nof publishing a Journal of the United Nations in all six \r\nofficial languages throughout the year particularly \r\ncomes to mind.\r\nThere are without a doubt many areas to focus on in \r\nthe forthcoming years and ample room for improvement \r\nwithin the framework of the revitalization of the General \r\nAssembly, but I remain confident that the constructive \r\ncooperation and consensus-based work we have seen so \r\nfar, further guided by the able leadership of President \r\nThomson at the seventy-first session, will continue to \r\npave the way for new practices and set new standards in \r\nthe functioning of the General Assembly.\r\nI thank the Assembly once again for its support, \r\ncooperation and confidence.\r\nA/71/PV.25 06/10/2016\r\n10/14 16-31169\r\nThe Acting President: I further wish to reiterate \r\nthe President of the General Assembly’s gratitude to the \r\nAmbassadors of Croatia and of Namibia for co-chairing \r\nthe Ad Hoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the \r\nWork of the General Assembly.\r\nMr. Pressman (United States of America): As we \r\nget an early start on this year’s revitalization process, \r\nthe United States would first like to thank the past \r\nyear’s co-Chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the \r\nRevitalization of the Work of the General Assembly, \r\nthe Permanent Representatives of Croatia and Namibia, \r\nfor their expert leadership throughout the year’s debates \r\nand their impressive work to maintain consensus on the \r\nannual resolution.\r\nDuring the course of the past year’s meetings, the \r\nWorking Group discussed a very wide range of issues \r\nrelated to the operations of the General Assembly. \r\nOne area that was particularly important was the work \r\ndone on increasing transparency and accountability in \r\nthe Office of the President. Addressing institutional \r\ndeficiencies in that Office is critical, and we were \r\nparticularly encouraged by the symbolism of the code \r\nof ethics created for members of the Office and the oath \r\ninaugurated by our new President when he assumed his \r\nduties in September.\r\nFor the past few years, the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup has committed much of its time and energy \r\nto the process of the selection of the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral. As we all know, the Security Council is this \r\nmorning providing its formal recommendation. We \r\nthink that António Guterres will be an extraordinary \r\nleader of the United Nations. With his appointment by \r\nthe General Assembly, Mr. Guterres will take the helm \r\nof the United Nations at one of the most consequential \r\nmoments in recent history. He will inherit some of the \r\nmost complicated challenges to international peace and \r\nsecurity, to human rights and to development.\r\nThe United Nations needs a visionary leader in these \r\ncomplicated times, and we believe we have found one in \r\nAntónio Guterres. With more population displacement \r\nin the world than at any time since the Second World \r\nWar, Mr. Guterres will leverage his past experience as \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\n(UNHCR) to give greater attention to the intense, \r\nurgent and often dire needs of displaced peoples. The \r\nUnited States is confident in Mr. Guterres’s leadership, \r\nhis dedication to transparency, effectiveness, \r\naccountability and fiscal discipline and his commitment \r\nto the founding principles and the aspirations of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAt UNHCR, António Guterres demonstrated a \r\ncapacity to deliver real results for the people who \r\nneeded it most, while reforming a bureaucracy in need \r\nof change. The United Nations and the brave men and \r\nwomen who serve the Organization, often in dangerous \r\nplaces far from their home, need and deserve the kind of \r\nresults-oriented leadership that Mr. Guterres has shown \r\nthroughout his career. He is in our view the clear choice \r\nto oversee the Organization through these uncertain \r\ntimes. We have been guided in this process in large part \r\nby the innovations contained in resolution 69/321 and \r\nreinforced in resolution 70/305 at the previous session.\r\nThe United States believes that these revitalization \r\nprocesses have been carried out faithfully, and we have \r\nbeen strong supporters. Ultimately, we believe the \r\nSecurity Council has put forward a candidate behind \r\nwhom Member States will rally and whose appointment \r\nwill send the strongest message that the Organization \r\nhas selected a leader who can help unify us around the \r\ncommon cause of advancing the noble and critical goals \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nAs we seem to be starting the revitalization work \r\nearlier this year, we hope that will provide opportunities \r\nfor the Ad Hoc Working Group to return to some of \r\nthe central issues we believe should be our priority. \r\nDuring the past several years, the Working Group \r\nhas been called on to look beyond its core mission of \r\nincreasing the Assembly’s efficiency, effectiveness and \r\ntransparency. However, to broaden our scope beyond \r\nthose central concerns or to seek to address issues that \r\nare considered in parallel in other bodies or committees \r\nwill only dilute our efforts and run counter to our \r\nprincipal goal of streamlining and rationalizing the \r\nAssembly’s work.\r\nGoing forward, we should prioritize tangible aspects \r\nof revitalization that will result in real improvements \r\nfor the work of this important body. These include \r\nstreamlining and prioritizing the agenda to avoid \r\nwasteful overlap, with an eye to removing outdated \r\ntopics and biennializing or triennializing what we can. \r\nFreeing the General Assembly’s agenda of outdated \r\ntopics would allow it more time to address important \r\ncontemporary issues, which could serve to increase \r\nfocus on, and the visibility of, the important work of \r\nthis body. We should also look to improve the practices \r\nand working methods of the Main Committees.\r\n06/10/2016 A/71/PV.25\r\n16-31169 11/14\r\nThe United States looks forward to continuing \r\nits active participation in the revitalization work of \r\nthe General Assembly and to working with all fellow \r\nMember States together on these important issues.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): Singapore aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered by the representative of \r\nLaos on behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations and by the representative of Algeria on behalf \r\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nI would like to make five additional points.\r\nFirst, the revitalization of the General Assembly \r\nis a work in progress. We have made great strides \r\nduring the past two years with the adoption of the two \r\nmilestone resolutions 69/321 and 70/305 under the \r\nable leadership of the Permanent Representatives of \r\nCroatia and Namibia. I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate them. However, we must not rest on our \r\nlaurels. As already stated, the process to improve the \r\nwork of the General Assembly and its processes must \r\ncontinue, and it must continue on the basis of consensus \r\nand enlarging the circle of consensus.\r\nSecondly, we welcome the President’s commitment \r\nto strengthening the transparency, accountability and \r\ninstitutional memory of his Office. We support the \r\npractical initiatives taken by Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, \r\nthe previous President of the Assembly, notably in \r\npreparing and circulating a handover report, which we \r\nthink has helped not only to strengthen the institutional \r\nmemory of the Office of the President but also to \r\npromote greater transparency in its work. We suggest \r\nthat the President should build on the handover report \r\nby compiling a list of best practices that can be adopted \r\nby future incoming Presidents. We also welcome the \r\nPresident’s decision to retain several staff members, \r\nincluding his predecessor’s Chef de Cabinet. We believe \r\nthat such initiatives will promote greater continuity and \r\nstrengthen the operational effectiveness of the Office. \r\nWe urge the next Secretary-General to make that issue \r\na priority, and we look forward to seeing the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s proposals for reviewing the budget allocation \r\nfor the Office of the President.\r\nThirdly, the efforts to make the selection and \r\nappointment process of the Secretary-General and \r\nother executives more open and transparent must \r\ncontinue. We welcome the new standard of openness \r\nand transparency, ushered in by former President \r\nLykketoft, that has been established for the selection \r\nand appointment of the next Secretary-General. In that \r\nregard, we look forward to having an opportunity as \r\nsoon as possible for the General Assembly to engage in \r\na meaningful interactive dialogue with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral designate, and we hope that such an informal \r\ndialogue can take place before his formal appointment \r\nby the Assembly.\r\nSingapore would also like to suggest that the \r\nPresident of the Assembly consider initiating a regular \r\ndialogue with the Secretary-General, which could take \r\nthe form of a regularly held town-hall meeting with \r\nall the members of the Assembly, presided over by the \r\nPresident. The aim would be to continue to build on \r\nthe directions and understanding established between \r\nthe General Assembly and the incoming Secretary-\r\nGeneral.\r\nThe fourth point I would like to make is that the \r\nimprovements in the appointment process must not \r\nstop with the Secretary-General but should extend to \r\nall other senior appointments within the Organization. \r\nWe call on the next Secretary-General to make \r\nappointments based on merit, taking into account \r\ngender and geographical balance, while also ensuring \r\nthe highest standards of efficiency, competence and \r\nintegrity. We do not believe that appointments of senior \r\nofficials, particularly Under-Secretaries-General and \r\nAssistant Secretaries-General, should be considered \r\nas being part of any deal or previously agreed package \r\namong a handful of countries.\r\nFifthly and finally, my delegation considers \r\nthe issue of improving the working methods of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and its Main Committees to be \r\nvery important. One priority is ensuring that the \r\nAssembly’s agendas, especially those of its Second \r\nand Third Committees, and those of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council and its subsidiary bodies, are working \r\ncoherently together to support implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Our leaders \r\nhave adopted the 17 Goals and 169 targets, and the onus \r\nis on all of us to ensure that we deliver on them.\r\nWe are happy to note that the President has made \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda a key priority. We \r\nlook forward to his strategy paper on the subject and \r\nwill work with him to see how best the United Nations \r\ncan work with Member States in order to make a \r\ndifference for our citizens. I would also like to endorse \r\nthe President’s comments on the need to review the \r\narrangements for the high-level week at the start of the \r\nAssembly’s new session. We should aim for fewer high-\r\nA/71/PV.25 06/10/2016\r\n12/14 16-31169\r\nlevel meetings but try to ensure that the ones we have \r\nare more focused and effective.\r\nI would like to conclude by saying that we have \r\nevery confidence that the President will build on the \r\nstrong foundations laid down by his predecessor \r\nand take the General Assembly to new heights of \r\ntransparency, accountability, efficiency and legitimacy. \r\nMy delegation stands ready to continue working \r\nclosely with him and his team and making a positive \r\ncontribution to that process.\r\nMr. Minami (Japan): I would like to start by \r\nthanking the President for convening today’s meeting \r\nand for his statement, which clearly defines his focus \r\nand intentions. My delegation concurs with others \r\nin considering resolutions 69/321 and 70/305, on \r\nrevitalization, to be groundbreaking. We would also \r\nlike to express our sincere gratitude to Ambassadors \r\nVladimir Drobnjak of Croatia and Wilfried Emvula of \r\nNamibia for their hard work and skill in chairing the Ad \r\nHoc Working Group on the Revitalization of the Work \r\nof the General Assembly.\r\nAs we all recall, there was an urgent and pressing \r\nneed for ensuring transparency in the Office of the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly during the previous \r\nsession. Indeed, the oath of office and code of ethics \r\nestablished for the President were the most important \r\nachievements of resolution 70/305. My delegation would \r\nlike to express its appreciation for the commitment \r\nof President Thomson and his team to continuing to \r\nensure the Office’s transparency. We will spare no \r\neffort in continuing to work with the Office on this very \r\nimportant matter.\r\nRegarding the selection of the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral, my delegation welcomes the recommendation \r\nof Mr. António Guterres that the Security Council \r\nhas just made to the General Assembly. Article 97 \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations stipulates that \r\n“[t]he Secretary-General shall be appointed by the \r\nGeneral Assembly upon the recommendation of the \r\nSecurity Council”. While it is legitimate that the entire \r\nmembership of the Assembly should be involved in that \r\nquestion, we do not have the luxury of time, given the \r\nnumber of immediate challenges we face today. Since \r\nno interruption can be allowed, it is our shared duty in \r\nthe General Assembly to appoint the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral as soon as possible,so that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate has enough time to prepare for \r\nthe transition from his predecessor. The President \r\ncirculated a letter on that point to all the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives on 23 September. My delegation \r\nwelcomes the initiative he has taken to move things \r\nforward as quickly as possible. We will certainly be \r\ndiscussing the subject in the very near future.\r\nI would now like to touch on the subject of the \r\ndecision-making process in the Assembly. While the \r\nGeneral Assembly has appointed the Secretary-General \r\nby acclamation since 1971, the records show that the \r\nfirst three Secretaries-General were appointed by a \r\nvote in the Assembly. It would be interesting for us to \r\nrevisit the past practice of acclamation and discuss the \r\nissue thoroughly. If a vote were held, it would give the \r\nAssembly a voice independent of the Security Council. \r\nHowever, my delegation would like to emphasize that \r\na Secretary-General should receive the unanimous \r\nsupport of the Member States at the end of the process.\r\nDuring the course of the seventy-first session, \r\nit will be important to continue our discussions of \r\nrevitalization of the Assembly, and particularly and \r\nessentially of its working methods. Japan has been very \r\nactive on the issue of improving working methods. \r\nFor example, resolution 68/307 moved the dates of the \r\nSecurity Council and Economic and Social Council \r\nelections from October to June. In order to achieve \r\nthe resolution’s intended goal of giving new members \r\nmore time to prepare for membership, Japan, as Chair \r\nof the Security Council’s Informal Working Group \r\non Documentation and Other Procedural Questions, \r\nproposed that the Informal Working Group revisit the \r\ntransitional arrangements for newly elected Council \r\nmembers. On 15 July, after intensive consultations, \r\nthe Security Council issued a new presidential note, \r\ncontained in document S/2016/619, which now invites \r\nnewly elected members to Council meetings starting \r\non 1 October. The note also brings more transparency \r\nand inclusivity to the selection process of the Chairs of \r\nsubsidiary organs.\r\nThe issue of rationalizing the General Assembly’s \r\nwork is also an urgent challenge. As we advocated last \r\nyear, we should consider biennializing or triennializing \r\nthe agenda items currently being discussed. We look \r\nforward to working with the President on that issue \r\nagain in the current session.\r\nJust as we moved the Security Council and \r\nEconomic and Social Council elections to earlier \r\ndates, we could also consider holding the election of \r\nthe President of the General Assembly earlier so that \r\n06/10/2016 A/71/PV.25\r\n16-31169 13/14\r\nthe President-elect has enough time to set up a team \r\nand prepare for the handover. My delegation already \r\nmade that proposal at the March meeting of the Ad Hoc \r\nWorking Group. I believe that the idea is in line with \r\nsuggestions made by several of the Chairs of the Main \r\nCommittees that stress the need to hold early elections \r\nin order to ensure a smooth transition.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming that \r\nJapan stands ready to support the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and to contribute constructively \r\nto discussions of the revitalization of the Assembly’s \r\nwork aimed at further enhancing the effectiveness and \r\ntransparency of the United Nations.\r\nMs. Krisnamurthi (Indonesia): Indonesia would \r\nfirst like to thank the President for convening this \r\nvery important joint debate. We would like to associate \r\nourselves with the statement delivered earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\non behalf of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nMany of the challenges confronting our world today \r\nare multidimensional and interconnected, and require a \r\nresponse that is also multidimensional, interconnected \r\nand well supported by all of us. There is no better \r\nplatform for dealing with the gamut of global issues \r\nthan the General Assembly, for it represents, uniquely, \r\nthe entirety of the United Nations membership, with \r\nits rich insights and collective wisdom. The Assembly \r\nmembers’ actions, ownership and support are essential \r\nto arriving at solutions that can deliver the goods. And \r\nwhile the General Assembly should examine problems \r\nof concern to its member States and come up with \r\ncogent answers, its members should also effectively \r\nimplement the resolutions it adopts.\r\nOver the years, the Assembly’s Main Committees \r\nand subsidiary organs have made commendable \r\nprogress on a number of issues. The Assembly’s high-\r\nlevel meetings on critical problems such as epidemics, \r\nnatural disasters, peace and security and development \r\nhave also been vital to enhancing our shared \r\nunderstanding and garnering international support. Yet \r\nit is also evident that there are gaps in implementation \r\nefforts. All stakeholders should shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities for implementing Assembly resolutions \r\nand decisions, which in turn contributes to the urgent \r\ngoal of revitalizing the Assembly.\r\nIndonesia fully supports strengthening the role \r\nand authority of the General Assembly in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations. It is very \r\nimportant that we all promote the Assembly’s central \r\nposition as the chief deliberative, policymaking and \r\nrepresentative United Nations organ. In that regard, \r\nIndonesia applauds the efforts of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup on the Revitalization of the Work of the General \r\nAssembly, under its co-Chairs during the seventieth \r\nsession, the Ambassadors of Croatia and Namibia. \r\nThe Ad Hoc Working Group’s examination of all four \r\ntopics before it and proposals on them, as reflected in \r\nits latest annual report and inventory chart (A/70/1003), \r\nhighlight areas of significant progress as well as those \r\nthat require action.\r\nThe past year has seen some key advances that we \r\nshould build on. Beginning with the landmark resolution \r\n69/321, the joint letter from the Presidents of the \r\nSecurity Council and General Assembly on soliciting \r\ncandidates for the position of Secretary-General, and \r\nthe subsequent informal dialogues between Member \r\nStates and candidates, have opened a new window in \r\nmaking the process of selecting the Secretary-General \r\nmore participatory. Together, we should see to it that \r\nthe General Assembly continues to play a leading role \r\nin ensuring that the current and future processes for \r\nselecting and appointing the Secretary-General are \r\nmore open, participatory and transparent.\r\nIt is also essential that the appointments of executive \r\nheads and other senior officials, both in the Secretariat \r\nand in the field, be clear examples of a merit-based \r\nand balanced geographic representation. In particular, \r\nqualified nationals from underrepresented developing \r\ncountries should be given due consideration.\r\nThe seventieth session also saw the elections to the \r\nEconomic and Social Council and to the non-permanent \r\nseats in the Security Council moved forward so that \r\nthey are now held six months in advance, another \r\npositive development. Such improvements in working \r\nmethods should continue.\r\nIndonesia welcomes resolution 70/305, which builds \r\non resolution 69/321. It breaks new ground, particularly \r\nregarding the transparency and accountability of the \r\nOffice of the President of the General Assembly, and we \r\nstrongly support that. However, while measures such as \r\nthe institution of an oath of office, a code of conduct, \r\nmandated record-keeping and financial disclosure are \r\nwelcome, it is vital that the Office of the President also \r\nhave an adequate budget, with the human resources it \r\nneeds to ensure its optimal performance, which must \r\nA/71/PV.25 06/10/2016\r\n14/14 16-31169\r\ninclude robust dissemination and outreach to global \r\naudiences.\r\nA key subject before the General Assembly at this \r\nsession and others to come is the effective facilitation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nAnother is its role in ensuring that conflict prevention \r\nand political solutions are accorded primacy through \r\nimprovements in regional partnerships and United \r\nNations mechanisms, as has been underscored by the \r\nthree major reviews of United Nations peace operations, \r\nits peacebuilding architecture, and its agenda on women \r\nand peace and security.\r\nThere are many other critical imperatives, some \r\nof them related, such as properly addressing the plight \r\nof the 65 million people who are currently displaced \r\naround the world. Much needs to be done, and it should \r\nbe done urgently and collaboratively. The General \r\nAssembly has a special role to play in helping to address \r\nour global challenges. But it can be only as robust as the \r\npolitical and financial backing that Member States give \r\nto it and its Main Committees and subsidiary bodies. \r\nTogether, let us enable the General Assembly to perform \r\nits role fully. The delegation of Indonesia will continue \r\nto work tirelessly in the Ad Hoc Working Group and \r\nother forums to contribute to and support steps that \r\nmeaningfully strengthen the General Assembly and its \r\nmechanisms.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.30 a.m.\r\n"
