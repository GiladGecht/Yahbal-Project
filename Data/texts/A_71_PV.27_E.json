On behalf of the General Assembly, I \r\nrequest the representative of the Kingdom of Thailand \r\nto convey our condolences to the royal family, the \r\nGovernment and the people of Thailand.\r\nMay I now invite representatives to stand and \r\nobserve a minute of silence in tribute to the memory of \r\nthe late King.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a \r\nminute of silence.\r\nThe President: A formal tribute in the General \r\nAssembly will be convened at a later date, to \r\nbe announced.\r\nAgenda item 113\r\nAppointment of the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations\r\nLetter from the President of the \r\nSecurity Council to the President of the General \r\nAssembly (A/71/531)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.4)\r\nThe President: I now call on the President of the \r\nSecurity Council, who will report to the Assembly on \r\nthe work undertaken by the Council on the appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): It is an honour for me, in my capacity as \r\nPresident of the Security Council for the month of \r\nOctober, to address the General Assembly in order to \r\nconvey the recommendation of the Security Council \r\nfor the appointment of the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAt its 7782nd meeting, held in private on 6 October, \r\nthe Security Council adopted by acclamation resolution \r\n2311 (2016) concerning the recommendation for \r\nthe appointment of the Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI shall now read out the text of the resolution. \r\nResolution 2311 (2016) reads as follows:\r\n“The Security Council,\r\n“Having considered the question of the \r\nrecommendation for the appointment of the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations,\r\n“Recommends to the General Assembly that \r\nMr. António Guterres be appointed Secretary-\r\nGeneral of the United Nations for a term of office \r\nfrom 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2021.”\r\nIn the joint letter of the President of the Security \r\nCouncil and the President of the General Assembly \r\ndated 15 December 2015, the Council pledged to \r\nconclude its part in the selection process in a timely \r\nmanner, so that the newly appointed Secretary-General \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The \r\nCouncil is pleased that, by adopting its recommendation \r\nfor the appointment on 6 October, the Council met that \r\nobjective. The Security Council believes that early \r\naction on the appointment by the General Assembly \r\nwould provide the new Secretary-General with enough \r\ntime to prepare for performing his duties.\r\nOn behalf of the Security Council, I would like \r\nto express appreciation to all Member States that \r\nnominated candidates as part of the selection process. I \r\nwould also like to express appreciation to the candidates \r\nwho have actively participated in the process. During \r\nthe informal meetings with each of them, the Council \r\nhad the opportunity to evaluate their high professional \r\nskills and commitment to the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe Security Council adopted resolution 2311 \r\n(2016) by acclamation. Accordingly, the members of the \r\nSecurity Council expressed their unconditional support \r\nfor Mr. António Guterres, who, if appointed today, will \r\nhead our common Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank you, Sir, for \r\nhaving convened this meeting expeditiously following \r\nthe recommendation made to the General Assembly by \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe President: In connection with the \r\nrecommendation of the Security Council, the General \r\nAssembly has before it a draft resolution issued as \r\ndocument A/71/L.4. The draft was prepared following \r\nextensive consultations between me, special advisers \r\non my behalf, and the United Nations membership. \r\nThroughout those consultations, a number of consistent \r\npriorities held by Member States emerged, and in that \r\ncontext, I want to thank all of them for their inputs, \r\nwhich were fundamental in the preparation of the text.\r\nDuring the drafting process, I was conscious of \r\nthe need to reflect the historic advances that had been \r\nmade in the process of the selection and appointment of \r\nthe Secretary-General, in line with resolutions 69/321 \r\nand 70/305. That included the acknowledgement of the \r\ntransparent and inclusive process that was undertaken, \r\nfrom the informal dialogues, which were conducted \r\nbetween the General Assembly and each of the \r\ncandidates, to the unprecedented level of cooperation \r\nbetween the Presidents of the General Assembly and \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe main task was to reflect, within the framework \r\nof the draft resolution on the appointment, the committed \r\nsupport for the process that was undertaken and the \r\nexpectations of Member States. With the reaffirmation \r\nof the role of the General Assembly, the reference to \r\nChapter XV of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nthe recognition of resolutions 69/321 and 70/305 as the \r\ncornerstones of the process, I am confident that the \r\ntext before the Assembly fully reflects the views of \r\nMember States.\r\nAfter the extensive consultations that I have had \r\nwith the membership, it is my understanding that the \r\nGeneral Assembly wishes to proceed with the adoption \r\nof draft resolution A/71/L.4 by acclamation.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to adopt by acclamation draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.4?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.4 was adopted by \r\nacclamation (resolution 71/4).\r\nThe President: I now request the Chief of Protocol \r\nto escort the Secretary-General-designate, His \r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres, to the platform.\r\nThe Chief of Protocol escorted the Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate, Mr. António Guterres, to \r\nthe platform.\r\nThe President: I have the honour to announce \r\nthat His Excellency Mr. António Guterres has been \r\nappointed by acclamation Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations for a term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2017 and ending on 31 December 2021.\r\nToday is indeed a momentous day. Since 1946, this \r\nis only the ninth time that the General Assembly has \r\ntaken action on the appointment of a new Secretary-\r\nGeneral. It is inherently a decision of deep consequence, \r\nas the entire membership agrees to the appointment of \r\nan individual to lead the United Nations. The process \r\nundertaken so as to arrive at today’s decision has been \r\na historic one.\r\nIt was shaped from the outset through committed \r\nengagement on the part of the General Assembly. For \r\nthe first time in the history of the United Nations, the \r\nselection and appointment process for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has been guided by the principles of \r\ntransparency and inclusivity. The process began with the \r\nfirst-ever joint call from the Presidents of the General \r\nAssembly and Security Council formally soliciting \r\n13/10/2016 A/71/PV.27\r\n16-32309 3/11\r\ncandidates for the job. From the outset, it acknowledged \r\nthe importance of geographic and gender balance and \r\nexplicitly invited the candidacies of women.\r\nIt was a process that specifically sought out \r\ncandidates who embody a firm commitment to \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, exemplify the highest standards of \r\nefficiency, competence and integrity, and have shown \r\nproven leadership and managerial abilities, extensive \r\nexperience in international relations and strong \r\ndiplomatic communication and multilingual skills.\r\nAnd throughout it all, the process emphasized \r\nthe need to secure the best possible candidate for the \r\nrole. Thirteen candidates of the highest standards were \r\npresented for consideration, seven of them women. From \r\nthe moment of the presentation of their nominations, \r\ntheir candidatures were subject to full public view \r\nwith the joint circulation of letters, the establishment \r\nof a dedicated website and the presentation of each \r\ncandidate’s vision for the Organization. All candidates \r\nwere given and took the opportunity to participate in \r\ninformal dialogues with the United Nations membership, \r\na process deeply enriched by the engagement of civil \r\nsociety and the wider global public.\r\nThroughout the process, a number of key messages \r\nbegan to resonate from Member States — the desire \r\nto continue to see an independent and courageous \r\nSecretary-General who will make full use of the powers \r\nprovided for him in the Charter of the United Nations; \r\na person who is committed to ensuring that the United \r\nNations both embraces and exemplifies gender equality \r\nat all levels; a person with the deftness and skills to \r\ninnovate and adapt the Organization’s structures, \r\ncapacities, culture and capabilities to respond to \r\ntoday’s major challenges; and the acknowledgment of \r\nthe importance of geographic and gender balance in \r\nsenior posts.\r\nI congratulate Mr. Guterres on having emerged \r\nas the best candidate from such a historic, rigorous \r\nand comprehensive process. Mr. Guterres embodies \r\nthe highest standards of competence, integrity and \r\nleadership needed for the position, and he brings with \r\nhim vast experience from his time as the Prime Minister \r\nof Portugal and the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees. His dedication to the ideals and common \r\nvalues of the United Nations is beyond doubt. I am \r\nconfident that Mr. Guterres will serve the global \r\ncommunity with dedication as a moral authority and \r\nbe the voice of our collective conscience and humanity \r\nthroughout his term.\r\nI assure Mr. Guterres of my full support throughout \r\nthe seventy-first session of the General Assembly \r\nand will do everything within my power to facilitate \r\na smooth transition process. I am pleased to say \r\nthat he has accepted my invitation to meet with the \r\nGeneral Assembly on 19 October in order to begin \r\na dialogue on critical, priority and emerging issues \r\nfor the Organization. Once again, congratulations to \r\nMr. Guterres.\r\nIt is now my honour to give the f loor to the \r\nSecretary-General, His Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon.\r\nThe Secretary-General: Before turning to our \r\nagenda item, I would like to offer my deep condolences \r\nto the royal family, the Government and the people of \r\nThailand on the passing of His Majesty King Bhumibol \r\nAdulyadej. His Majesty King Adulyadej was revered by \r\nthe people of Thailand as a unifying national leader. He \r\nwas also highly respected internationally. At this time \r\nof sorrow and loss, I hope that Thailand will continue to \r\nhonour King Adulyadej’s legacy of commitment to the \r\nuniversal values and respect for human rights.\r\nAbove all, to the Secretary-General-designate, I \r\noffer my best wishes and congratulations.\r\nI commend the Member States not only for their \r\nchoice of Secretary-General but also for the way in \r\nwhich they went about making that choice. The first-\r\never public hearings on the selection of a Secretary-\r\nGeneral opened the process to the world. Several highly \r\nqualified women and men were given a unique platform \r\nfrom which to share their vision and answer questions \r\nfrom the diplomatic community and civil society. Those \r\nnew steps established a new benchmark for openness \r\nand engagement.\r\nSecretary-General-designate Guterres is well \r\nknown to all of us in the Hall, but he is perhaps the \r\nbest known where it counts most — on the front lines \r\nof armed conflict and humanitarian suffering. For \r\nthe past decade, the work of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees and other humanitarian \r\nactors has provided a lifeline for millions upon millions \r\nof people forced from their homes. They also received \r\nsomething else — compassion. The same solidarity \r\nwas at the heart of the High Commissioner’s effective \r\nadvocacy around the globe.\r\nA/71/PV.27 13/10/2016\r\n4/11 16-32309\r\nMr. Guterres also brings deeds and solid political \r\nexperience, including his two terms of service as \r\nPrime Minister of Portugal. His political instincts are \r\nthose of the United Nations — cooperation for the \r\ncommon good and shared responsibility for people \r\nand the planet. He recognizes the crucial importance \r\nof women’s empowerment from peace-negotiations \r\ntables to the halls of this house. As an active participant \r\nin the Senior Management Group and the Chief \r\nExecutives Board, he understands the inner workings \r\nof our Organization. I have long valued his advice and \r\nadmired his spirit of service. He is a wonderful choice \r\nto steer this Organization as we build on the progress \r\nof the past decade, while addressing the insecurity and \r\nuncertainties of today’s world.\r\nThe Secretary-General-designate has often shared \r\nhis feelings on the privilege of being a part of the \r\nUnited Nations. Despite all the challenges, he said, \r\n“This is still the best place in the world to work”. After \r\n10 years, I could not agree more. Today’s ceremony is \r\nalso poignant for me, since it takes place 10 years after \r\nthe day of my own election in 2006. As I prepare to \r\nhand over the baton of leadership, I know that Member \r\nStates, the outstanding women and men of the United \r\nNations and the people of the world are all looking \r\nforward to his tenure with confidence and excitement.\r\nI congratulate him and wish him great success.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis statement.\r\nIt is now my honour to give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the Niger, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of African States.\r\nMr. Wafy (Niger): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States on this important \r\noccasion of the appointment of the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral, under agenda item 113.\r\nThe African Group welcomes the commitment to \r\nremaining faithful to the General Assembly’s call for \r\nincreased transparency and inclusivity in the selection \r\nand appointment of the next Secretary-General, in \r\naccordance with article 97 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. It therefore fully endorses the approach taken \r\nin adopting the President’s text by acclamation, which, \r\namong other things, appoints Mr. António Guterres as \r\nSecretary-General for a term of office beginning on \r\n1 January 2017 and ending on 31 December 2021.\r\nThe African Group extends its heartiest \r\ncongratulations to Mr. António Guterres on his \r\ndesignation to take the helm of the United Nations, \r\nbringing on board a wealth of experience in global \r\naffairs, and it further assures him of the African \r\nGroup’s full support and commitment in the discharge \r\nof his mandate. The African Group is particularly \r\nencouraged by the transparency and inclusivity that \r\nguided the selection process, which re-enforced the \r\nlegitimacy of the General Assembly and, indeed, the \r\nnomination of Mr. Guterres. Our deepest gratitude goes \r\nout to His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventieth session, for his \r\nexemplary leadership throughout the selection process, \r\nas well as to you, Mr. President, for leading the process \r\nto its logical conclusion.\r\nI cannot conclude without seizing this opportunity \r\nto commend, on behalf of the African Group, Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon for his laudable achievements, \r\nalbeit under very difficult circumstances. Particularly \r\nnotable are his enduring legacies of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change.\r\nIn conclusion, the African Group looks forward to \r\nthe upcoming informal meeting of the General Assembly \r\nplenary with the Secretary-General-designate, to be \r\nheld on 19 October, as a unique opportunity to further \r\nengage on issues of priority and interest to the African \r\nGroup and more broadly, on how to make the United \r\nNations fit for purpose.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Kuwait, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Asia-Pacific States.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait): I have the honour and \r\nprivilege today to address the General Assembly \r\non behalf of the Group of Asia-Pacific States on the \r\noccasion of the adoption of resolution 71/4, which \r\nendorses the Security Council recommendation to \r\nappoint Mr. António Guterres as the ninth Secretary-\r\nGeneral for five years beginning 1 January 2017.\r\nI would like to begin by taking this opportunity \r\nto thank our current Secretary-General, Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon, who over the past 10 years has served the \r\nUnited Nations with dignity and humility. We are proud \r\nthat Mr. Ban is from our region. He has inspired global \r\ndevelopment for the future by pushing for advancements \r\nin the areas of women’s empowerment, gender equality, \r\nhuman rights and climate change. His tireless efforts \r\n13/10/2016 A/71/PV.27\r\n16-32309 5/11\r\nresulted, inter alia, in the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, which will enter into force on 4 November. \r\nAlso highly commendable was his drive to ensure that \r\nthe work of the Millennium Development Goals would \r\nnot be lost. He promoted the post-2015 development \r\nagenda, which includes the assurance that no one will \r\nbe left behind, by encouraging Member States to adopt \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals to help protect the \r\nplanet for future generations.\r\nWe would like to thank him for his many years of \r\nservice to the Organization, and we wish him well in all \r\nof his future endeavours. We reconfirm our commitment \r\nand support for him as he continues to serve out his \r\nremaining 78 days in office.In this occasion, we would \r\nalso like to take the opportunity to thank Mrs. Ban \r\nSoon-taek, who has steadfastly stood by her husband \r\nduring his 10 years as Secretary-General and played \r\nan active role by travelling around the world with him \r\nto advocate the ideals of the United Nations. She has \r\nhelped to organize and has actively participated in \r\nnumerous events to fund humanitarian activities, such \r\nas the United Nations International Bazaar. She also \r\nworked to advance the rights of children, women and \r\nsenior citizens by bringing attention to issues such as \r\nautism and violence against women, and for that, we \r\ntruly thank her.\r\nI am pleased and honoured, on behalf of the Asia-\r\nPacific Group, to extend our sincere congratulations \r\nto Mr. António Guterres on his election as Secretary-\r\nGeneral. Mr. Guterres’ election signals an era of change \r\nat the United Nations in the procedure for the selection \r\nof the Secretary-General, which this year involved \r\npublic hearings, informal dialogue, a global town hall \r\nmeeting and meetings with all United Nations regional \r\ngroups. Never has the selection process been more open \r\nand transparent.\r\nThroughout the six straw polls taken by the Security \r\nCouncil, Mr. Guterres was a clear favourite for the \r\nposition. Moreover, Mr. Guterres’ extensive knowledge \r\nand expertise, clearly reflected in the interactive \r\ndialogue held with him in the General Assembly, \r\nenabled him to gain unanimous support from its \r\nMembers. Mr. Guterres has presented a clear vision for \r\nthe role of the United Nations that provides all Member \r\nStates with renewed hope for the future. He brings to \r\nthe position a wealth of knowledge, professional skill, \r\nvision, experience and wisdom as a veteran politician \r\nand leader, showing leadership abilities that will serve \r\nhim well in the role of Secretary-General.\r\nThe Asia-Pacific Group welcomes Secretary-\r\nGeneral designate António Guterres and wishes him \r\nsuccess in fulfilling that central role at an exceedingly \r\ncritical time in the history of the United Nations. \r\nMr. Guterres’ undeniable commitment is the stronghold \r\nof the platform and the priorities that he envisions. \r\nThe States members of the Asia-Pacific Group pledge \r\ntheir firm support to him in encountering the new \r\nand emerging challenges that lie ahead. That unified \r\nsupport embodies the confidence of knowing that the \r\nSecretary-General-designate is well suited to head \r\nour Organization.\r\nWe all aspire to put an end to the prolonged \r\nconflicts transpiring in certain parts of our world, which \r\nconstitute threats to international peace and security. \r\nWe stand with the Secretary-General-designate in his \r\ncoming efforts to mediate those grave disputes. We \r\nbelieve that his leadership, together with our collective \r\nefforts encompassing the principles and purposes of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations as an integral tool, will \r\nassist in attaining a peaceful solution and reconciliation.\r\nWe remain confident that, in the light of the need \r\nto promote development and growth, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate will persevere in achieving the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, with high hopes for \r\ntheir ultimate realization. His statesmanship and years \r\nof diplomacy will foster further strengthening of the \r\nstructure of the United Nations. While reinforcing \r\nmultilateralism, Mr. Guterres will, we trust, engage \r\nin the ongoing reform of the United Nations, as \r\nrevitalization will ensure the Organization’s resilience \r\nin tackling the various challenges faced.\r\nTerrorism, violent extremism, xenophobia, \r\nracism, religious intolerance and their ramifications \r\nhave led to daunting concerns worldwide. They are \r\namong the foremost issues on which the Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate needs to raise awareness and counter \r\nthe resulting threats through international cooperation.\r\nAs Mr. Guterres assumes the position of Secretary-\r\nGeneral, I wish to quote Sir Isaac Newton, one of the \r\nmost historically influential people, with the hope \r\nthat it will serve him well in his effort to pacify social \r\ntensions, “We build too many walls and not enough \r\nbridges”. We, the States members of the Asia-Pacific \r\nGroup, trust that he will confront relevant issues with \r\nresolute determination. It is our hope that, under his \r\nleadership, we, as nations united, will build the bridges \r\nA/71/PV.27 13/10/2016\r\n6/11 16-32309\r\nneeded to pave the way to a peaceful, prosperous and \r\njust world.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Georgia, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): I am honoured to make \r\nthis statement on behalf of the Group of Eastern \r\nEuropean States. It is my great pleasure to congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. António Guterres on his successful \r\ncompletion of the journey to become the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral. His outstanding experience in top positions at \r\nboth the national and the international levels and his \r\nvision of effective multilateralism reassure us of his \r\nmasterly stewardship of the Organization in the years \r\nto come. We rely on his courage and wisdom to make \r\nan important and lasting contribution to our common\r\n“quest for a peaceful, inclusive and sustainably \r\ndeveloped world, in which international law and \r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person are \r\nfully pursued”,\r\nas he stated in his vision statement of 12 April before \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nThe selection of Mr. Guterres as Secretary-General \r\nis even more important owing to the transparent and \r\ninclusive process in which he and the other candidates \r\ntook part for the first time in the history of the United \r\nNations. We acknowledge the highly professional \r\nperformance on the part of each candidate, including \r\nthose from the Eastern European Group.\r\nWe further look forward to building upon the \r\nsuccess achieved through the ground-breaking work \r\non the revitalization of the General Assembly, as \r\nreflected in resolutions 69/321 and 70/305, in terms \r\nof strengthening the Assembly’s accountability, \r\ntransparency and institutional memory. We remain \r\ncommitted to exploring ways of further improving \r\nthe process, including by further promoting gender \r\nequality and regional balance in selecting candidates \r\nfor positions as high-ranking United Nations officials.\r\nThe leadership of the Secretary-General will be \r\npivotal as we strive to implement the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and address the question \r\nof climate change. His role as the top United Nations \r\ndiplomat will be crucial in tackling the looming \r\nhumanitarian crises in the world and in negotiating \r\nsolutions for countries emerging from conflict, as well \r\nas protracted conflicts and sustaining peace.\r\nAs the leader serving 7 billion persons around the \r\nglobe, his determination to foster respect for human \r\nrights will be decisive. We fully support the holistic \r\napproach of connecting the dots so as to overcome \r\nthe challenges among the three pillars of the United \r\nNations, namely, peace and security, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and human rights, by developing policies \r\nto further enhance the role and relevance of the United \r\nNations.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, for his tireless work and dedication. \r\nThe Secretary-General designate, Mr. António \r\nGuterres, will be able to count on unsparing support \r\nand cooperation on the part of our regional Group.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Chile, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nMr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the Group of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates, I have the honour to welcome and extend our \r\nwarmest congratulations to the newly appointed \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. António Guterres. His stature \r\nand diplomatic competence, together with his broad \r\nexperience in many areas, make him an eminently \r\nsuitable person for this demanding key position, \r\nat a time when the international community has \r\ntaken the historical commitment to free the human \r\nrace from poverty, as set out in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nHis 10-year experience as United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees has become more relevant \r\nthan ever, as we face large movements of refugees and \r\nmigrants, one of our most pressing challenges. We are \r\nconfident that Mr. Guterres will undertake his role \r\nin a manner based on independence and committed \r\nleadership, thus instilling the highest standards of \r\nintegrity within the United Nations system, while \r\npromoting unity and understanding in seeking the best \r\nglobal solutions. We are also confident that Mr. Guterres \r\nwill introduce a renewed impetus for promoting the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe Latin American and Caribbean Group looks \r\nforward to continuing its close and cooperative \r\nrelationship with the United Nations in various fields, \r\nincluding development, the Sustainable Developments \r\nGoals, climate change, peace and security, \r\ndecolonization, human rights and democracy.\r\n13/10/2016 A/71/PV.27\r\n16-32309 7/11\r\nOur Group extends its appreciation to all of the \r\ncandidates that participated in the selection process, \r\nincluding in the interactive dialogues with the General \r\nAssembly, contributing to the process’ transparency \r\nand openness. The Group also highlights the role played \r\nby the General Assembly in that process, in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations and resolutions \r\n69/321 and 70/305, and further stresses the need to \r\nensure the implementation of the provisions, inter alia, \r\non the fair and equal distribution of senior posts, based \r\non gender and geographical balance.\r\nFinally, I wish to convey our Group’s deepest \r\nappreciation to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\ncontinuous efforts and contribution to the success of \r\nthe United Nations, under his decade-long leadership. \r\nWe look forward to his ongoing leadership until the \r\nconclusion of his term.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nGroup of Western European and other States.\r\nMr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): On behalf of the \r\nGroup of Western European and other States, it is an \r\nhonour and a privilege to address the Assembly as we \r\nwelcome the appointment of Mr. António Guterres as \r\nthe next Secretary-General. Today, Mr. Guterres, the \r\nformer Prime Minister of Portugal and former United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Refugees, has been \r\nselected to serve as the Head of the Organization. \r\nWe offer him our warmest congratulations and look \r\nforward to working with him from January.\r\nFrom his first day in office, we pledge to provide \r\nour fullest support to Mr. Guterres, and we commit to \r\nassisting him in upholding the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. We look to him to \r\nmanage the Secretariat efficiently and effectively and \r\nto advance much-needed reforms so as to enhance the \r\nability of the United Nations to face the challenges of \r\nthe century, and we express our utmost confidence in his \r\nexperience, ability and skills to lead this Organization \r\nover the coming years.\r\nIn doing so, we also express our deep gratitude to \r\nthe outgoing Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, as \r\nhe concludes his second term at the end of the year. We \r\napplaud his leadership on the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, on \r\nhuman rights and on so many other issues over the past \r\n10 years, and we look to him to continue his vital work \r\nuntil the end of his tenure.\r\nWe also pay tribute to the Assembly for the role \r\nit has played in improving the selection process. The \r\nenhancements set out in resolutions 69/321 and 70/305, \r\nin particular, have brought unprecedented transparency, \r\neffectiveness and inclusivity to the selection of the \r\nSecretary-General. Moreover, we welcome the fact \r\nthat it was possible to conclude the process quickly, \r\neffectively and consensually in the Security Council, \r\nenabling a smooth transition for Mr. Guterres as well \r\nas sufficient time for him to prepare for his new role. \r\nTogether, the Assembly has set a new standard for \r\nthe process and should continue to encourage more \r\ntransparency and equitability in the future.\r\nIn closing, we offer our congratulations again to \r\nMr. Guterres and look forward to his leadership.  His \r\ntenure comes at a time when the challenges to this \r\nOrganisation and the multilateral system as a whole \r\nare becoming even more complex. Peace and security \r\ncrises are having significant humanitarian, human \r\nrights and development impacts around the world. A \r\nstrong United Nations is needed more than ever, and \r\ntoday we have chosen a strong Secretary-General to \r\nlead it.\r\nIt now falls to us, the Member States, to support \r\nMr. Guterres and to cooperate closely with him on \r\ndecisions that can maintain, strengthen and solidify the \r\nrole of the United Nations in addressing the greatest \r\nglobal challenges.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of the host country.\r\nMs. Power (United States of America): As the \r\nproud host country of the United Nations, the United \r\nStates joins all the other delegations in this Hall in \r\nwelcoming the appointment of António Guterres as the \r\nnext Secretary-General.\r\nLet me start by saying a word about Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who over the past 10 years has \r\nshown that progress can be made by setting ambitious \r\ngoals and mobilizing Member States to meet them. \r\nSecretary-General Ban was instrumental in driving the \r\nmomentum and the concrete commitments necessary to \r\nachieve both the historic Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange and the Sustainable Development Goals. They \r\nare achievements that — if implemented by Member \r\nStates — will improve people’s lives for decades to \r\nA/71/PV.27 13/10/2016\r\n8/11 16-32309\r\ncome. The United States is profoundly grateful to \r\nSecretary-General Ban for his leadership and his \r\nservice to our peoples and to our planet.\r\nThe selection of António Guterres as the ninth \r\nSecretary-General is an extraordinary outcome that \r\nmatches the world’s growing demands for a strong \r\nUnited Nations. It is all the more extraordinary \r\nbecause — let us be honest — all too often at the United \r\nNations, narrow agendas keep us divided and prevent \r\nus from taking constructive action. I would like to \r\nhighlight three ways in which this appointment and the \r\nprocess that gave rise to it exceeded expectations. This \r\nshould inspire us all going forward.\r\nFirst, given the well-known divisions in the \r\nSecurity Council, many feared that the Council would \r\nfail to reach consensus on the next Secretary-General. \r\nI confess that I harboured some of those doubts myself, \r\nwondering if I should avoid making Christmas plans \r\nwith my family in case the process dragged on and I \r\nwould end up spending Christmas Day on our forty-ninth \r\nSecurity Council straw poll. Others thought — given \r\nthe polarization of the Council — that we would agree \r\non a recommendation to the General Assembly, but \r\nthat we would necessarily have to settle for a lowest-\r\ncommon-denominator candidate, someone who would \r\navoid taking stands on the world’s most pressing issues.\r\nWe have the privilege today of appointing a \r\nsupremely qualified candidate as Secretary-General, \r\nbut also one who has a passion for using that office as \r\nan independent force to prevent conflict and to alleviate \r\nhuman suffering. The countries of the world — here \r\nreflecting, I believe, the longings and the urgent needs \r\nof our citizens — are calling on the United Nations, and \r\nby extension, the Secretary-General, to do more than \r\nthis institution has ever done before.\r\nFor the United Nations to succeed, we are asking \r\nMr. Guterres to serve as a peacemaker, looking for \r\nways to end the brutal conflicts in places like Syria, \r\nYemen, and South Sudan. We are asking him to serve as \r\na reformer, streamlining the bureaucracy, eliminating \r\nredundancies and making sure that peacekeepers \r\nare willing and able to protect civilians at risk. And \r\nwe are asking him to serve as an advocate, rallying \r\nthe world to respond to humanitarian and man-made \r\ncatastrophes, and defending the human rights of all \r\npeople, regardless of their race, creed, nationality, \r\nsexual orientation or gender identity. As challenging as \r\nthose roles may be, we are confident that Mr. Guterres \r\ncan fill them with distinction.\r\nSecondly, there were fears that the decision-making \r\nprocess for such a critical position would again end up \r\nbeing narrow, exclusive and shrouded in secrecy. Even \r\nthough fewer people smoke cigarettes in 2016, the \r\nimage of a few countries huddled in smoke-filled rooms \r\npervaded. But this year, at long last, the process evolved. \r\nFor the first time, those vying for the job had to defend \r\ntheir visions for a more secure, just and humane future in \r\ninformal dialogues that the entire world could watch in \r\nreal time. And those conversations mattered — there is \r\nno question that the dialogues in the General Assembly \r\nand elsewhere shaped perceptions and informed \r\nthe thinking of the Council and the broader United \r\nNations membership from the outset. I thank all of the \r\nexceptional candidates who participated in that more \r\ninclusive, more transparent process, and the United \r\nStates thanks all Member States that contributed to \r\nmaking that process so much stronger.\r\nOf course, some envisaged that change would look \r\na little different in the end. Hopes were high that this \r\nelection process would deliver the first-ever woman \r\nSecretary-General. As the only woman Permanent \r\nRepresentative serving in the current Security Council \r\nand as one of only 37 women Permanent Representatives \r\nout of the 193 Permanent Representatives in the \r\nOrganization, I joined others in encouraging a level \r\nplaying field for women. And we should consider that \r\nuntil this year, only three women were ever voted upon \r\nby the Security Council as candidates — three women \r\nover the course of 70 years. This time, seven out of the \r\n13 candidates voted upon by the Security Council were \r\nwomen. So, over twice as many women were considered \r\nin 2016 as in all of the previous years together.\r\nWhile being a woman is not among Mr. Guterres’s \r\nmany qualifications, he has pledged gender parity at all \r\nlevels of the United Nations, with clear benchmarks and \r\ntime frames. That builds upon Mr. Guterres’s progress \r\ntowards achieving gender parity in the workplace as the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and \r\nback when he was the Portuguese Prime Minister.\r\nThirdly and finally, there was scepticism that we \r\ncould find in a single candidate a person who could \r\nsimultaneously get Heads of State on the phone to \r\nmobilize coalitions and be a person of the people, \r\nsomeone who really appreciated — indeed, felt — the \r\npain of the vulnerable. And vulnerable people do not \r\n13/10/2016 A/71/PV.27\r\n16-32309 9/11\r\njust want the United Nations to do and be better; they \r\nneed the Organization and for us to be and do better.\r\nIn Mr. Guterres, we have selected a candidate who \r\nbrings both head and heart to the job. Former staff of \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees (UNHCR) have described Mr. Guterres as \r\nso impatient to find out the facts of a crisis that he never \r\nhesitated to call staff in the field, no matter what their \r\nrank or their place in the hierarchy. He always asked \r\nhow UNHCR headquarters could serve their needs, \r\nrather than the other way around. When he saw that \r\nUNHCR teams in the field were starved for resources, \r\nhe shifted funds to help refugees in need, instead of \r\nadding jobs in Geneva. And he got out from behind \r\nhis desk. Mr. Guterres travelled to the refugee camps \r\nand witnessed for himself the current crises and the \r\npain and suffering of the displaced, even spending the \r\nnight in tents in the refugee camps. We have selected \r\na candidate who is prepared to cut past the jargon and \r\nthe acronyms and the sterile briefings, and get real. He \r\nknows that the only measure of our work here is whether \r\nwe are or are not helping and supporting real people.\r\nIn closing, in 1953, the first Secretary-General, \r\nTrygve Lie, who was heavily criticized by both the \r\nSoviet and the United States Governments, was so \r\nfrustrated by the limits of his office that his parting \r\nadvice to his successor was, “Welcome to the most \r\nimpossible job on this Earth”. The job has not grown \r\neasier with time, but it has arguably become even more \r\nimportant.\r\nI wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nand Mrs. Ban again for their tireless, tremendous \r\nservice and for their sacrifice. I thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral designate, Mr. Guterres, for taking on this \r\nmonumental responsibility. We hope that the unity \r\nthat we see today can be sustained, the inclusivity and \r\ntransparency of the process extended and the passion of \r\nthe Secretary-General-designate and that of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon embodied in the daily work of \r\nthe Organization. We look forward to a partnership that \r\npays dividends to the people out there who count on us.\r\nThe President: I now invite His Excellency \r\nMr. António Guterres, Secretary-General-designate, to \r\nmake a statement.\r\nMr. Guterres: When I heard the Security Council’s \r\ndecision to recommend me to the General Assembly, my \r\nfeelings could be described by just two words: gratitude \r\nand humility. It is with the same gratitude and humility \r\nthat I stand before the Assembly today; those feelings \r\nare now joined by a profound sense of responsibility.\r\nI am grateful, first of all, to the General Assembly \r\nand the Security Council for entrusting me with the \r\nposition of Secretary-General of the United Nations in a \r\nremarkable demonstration of consensus and unity. I am \r\nalso grateful for the transparency and openness of the \r\nselection process and to the many competent, thoughtful \r\nand dedicated candidates who came forward. I believe \r\nthat the new selection process has meant that the true \r\nwinner today is the credibility of the United Nations. \r\nThe process has also made it very clear to me that, \r\nhaving been chosen by all Member States, I must be at \r\nthe service of them all equally and with no agenda but \r\nthe one enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nI want to express my deep gratitude for the generous \r\nand kind words of the speakers who preceded me, but I \r\nmust say that I am fully aware of the challenges that the \r\nUnited Nations faces and the limitations surrounding \r\nthe Secretary-General. The dramatic problems of \r\ntoday’s complex world can only inspire a humble \r\napproach — one in which the Secretary-General alone \r\nneither has all the answers, nor seeks to impose his \r\nown views and in which the Secretary-General makes \r\nhis good offices available, working as a convener, a \r\nmediator, a bridge-builder and an honest broker to help \r\nfind solutions that benefit everyone involved.\r\nOver the past 10 years, I have witnessed at first \r\nhand the suffering of the most vulnerable people on \r\nEarth. I have visited war zones and refugee camps \r\nwhere one might legitimately ask: what has happened \r\nto the dignity and worth of the human person, referred \r\nto in the second preambular paragraph of the Charter? \r\nWhat has made us immune to the plight of those who \r\nare most socially and economically underprivileged? \r\nAll of that makes me feel the acute responsibility to \r\nmake human dignity the core of my work and, I trust, \r\nthe core of our common work.\r\nIt also underscores the importance of gender \r\nequality. I have long been aware of the hurdles that \r\nwomen face in society, the family and the workplace \r\njust because of their gender. I have witnessed the \r\nviolence to which they are subjected during conflict or \r\nwhile f leeing violence, just because they are women. \r\nI have tried to address that problem through every \r\npublic office that I have ever held. The protection and \r\nempowerment of women and gender parity within the \r\nA/71/PV.27 13/10/2016\r\n10/11 16-32309\r\nOrganization are and will continue to be a priority \r\ncommitment for me.\r\nI have faith in the United Nations — a reform-\r\nminded United Nations — because I believe in the \r\nuniversal values that it stands for, namely, peace, \r\njustice, human dignity, tolerance and solidarity. Based \r\non those values, I believe that diversity in all its forms \r\nis a tremendous asset, not a threat, and that in societies \r\nthat are more and more multi-ethnic, multicultural \r\nand multireligious, diversity can bring us together and \r\nshould not drive us apart. We must make sure that we \r\nare able to break the alliance between all those terrorist \r\ngroups or violent extremists, on one side, and the \r\nexpressions of populism and xenophobia, on the other. \r\nThey reinforce one another, and we must be able to \r\nfight both of them with determination.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWithout peace, life is devoid of all its meaning. \r\nWithout peace, we cannot ensure the sustainable \r\ndevelopment and respect for human rights that, in turn, \r\nunderpin peace. Unfortunately, peace today is largely \r\nlacking in our world.\r\nBecause of its global reach and the principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter, the United Nations has the \r\nmoral obligation and universal right to use diplomacy \r\nto achieve peace as its primary responsibility. That \r\ndiplomacy must be able to promote diversity and the \r\nrepresentative character of the United Nations; it \r\nmust facilitate a forum for dialogue in a public space \r\nopen to all, so that we can learn to work together and \r\nbetter know and listen to one another; and it must be \r\nable to ease tensions and arrive at peaceful solutions \r\nto conflicts that prevent so many human beings from \r\nleading their lives in a manner worthy of that word.\r\nWhen I studied history in high school — and I must \r\nsay that I studied with passion — almost all wars ended \r\nwith victors. But today’s conflicts know only losers. \r\nWars seem endless; they are becoming increasingly \r\ncomplex and interconnected, and fuel hatred and \r\nterrorism. At the same time, the suffering that they \r\ncause is morally intolerable, and security is threatened \r\neverywhere. It is our collective responsibility to end \r\nthat state of affairs.\r\nI am well aware that among us there are various \r\nviews and sometimes competing legitimate interests \r\nthat create division and make our unified efforts \r\ntowards peace difficult. But the threats to our collective \r\nsecurity, the nature of our societies and the survival \r\nof the planet as we know it are such that our common \r\ninterest must prevail against all that divides us. Let \r\nus unite for the sake of peace. That is the most urgent \r\ndemand of the citizens of the world that we are here \r\nto serve.\r\n(spoke in Spanish)\r\nI would like to convey my appreciation for the \r\ntireless efforts of the peacekeepers who, deployed far \r\nfrom their homes, defend the principles of the United \r\nNations. I also would like to call on all Member States \r\nand structures of the Organization for their support \r\nin not allowing repugnant behaviour to damage the \r\nreputation of the heroic efforts carried out in the service \r\nof the United Nations. It is within the United Nations and \r\nunder its blue f lag that the world can meet together and \r\nbuild peace, with determination, creativity, solidarity \r\nand compassion.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAllow me, before finishing, to salute the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Ban Ki-moon. I had the honour of working \r\nwith him throughout many years and have witnessed \r\nhis unfailing dedication to the cause of international \r\npublic service. I will do my utmost to honour Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon’s legacy. What he has achieved, in particular \r\nin relation to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, is absolutely remarkable, and I will do my best \r\nto support the efforts necessary to fully implement what \r\nhas been accomplished thus far, thanks to his guidance \r\nand leadership.\r\nI also want to express my admiration for the \r\ndedication and commitment of the United Nations \r\nstaff. Having been a staff member for over a decade, I \r\nam thrilled with the prospect of becoming a colleague \r\nonce again.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe dream of the founders of the United Nations \r\nhas yet to be fulfilled. Much has been accomplished, \r\nbut the road ahead remains long. We must embark on \r\nthat road together, we, the people, in our various roles, \r\nbecause the goal is within reach — the well-being \r\nof humankind.\r\nThe President: I thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate for his statement, and I request the \r\nChief of Protocol to escort him to room GA-200.\r\n13/10/2016 A/71/PV.27\r\n16-32309 11/11\r\nThe Secretary-General-designate was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: Before proceeding further, I would \r\nlike to inform members that the oath of office ceremony \r\nwill take place at a later date, to be announced. I \r\nwould also like to inform members that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate will be in the West Foyer in 10 \r\nminutes to receive felicitations.\r\nWe have thus concluded our consideration of \r\nagenda item 113.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.15 a.m.\r\n"
