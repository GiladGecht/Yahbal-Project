(Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda items 68\r\nPromotion and protection of human rights\r\n(a) Implementation of human rights instruments\r\nCommemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nthe adoption of the International Covenant on \r\nCivil and Political Rights and the International \r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural \r\nRights\r\nThe President: Fifty years ago, the General \r\nAssembly made a historic advancement in our efforts \r\nto promote and protect human rights across our globe \r\nthrough the adoption of the International Covenant \r\non Civil and Political Rights and the International \r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. \r\nThis landmark achievement built upon the commitments \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights by legally obligating \r\nStates, for the first time, to respect, protect and fulfil \r\nthe human rights inherent in each and every individual.\r\nIn the 50 years since their adoption, the International \r\nCovenants have become cornerstones of both \r\ninternational law and the international human rights \r\nframework, based upon the fundamental recognition of \r\nthe universality, indivisibility and independent nature \r\nof human rights. Across our world, they have helped to \r\nshape constitutions, laws, policies and justice systems. \r\nThey have had a transformative effect on the lives of \r\npeople across the globe. This has been so because the \r\npower of the International Covenants resides in their \r\nability to protect universal rights and freedoms in \r\ndiverse circumstances and situations. And the expert \r\ncommittees that are upholding the implementation of \r\nthe International Covenants have ensured that their \r\nprovisions continue to frame our policy responses to a \r\ncomplex and rapidly changing world.\r\nDespite the great progress we have made, we \r\nlive in times when people across our world are being \r\ndenied their most fundamental human rights. Violent \r\nextremism is on the rise and waves of intolerance and \r\nhate are targeting minorities, migrants and our most \r\nvulnerable. Greater restrictions are being placed on our \r\nmost basic rights and freedoms, including the rights \r\nto life, liberty and security; equality before the law; \r\nto gender equality, education and health; to freedom \r\nof expression, worship and association and to freedom \r\nfrom discrimination, torture, slavery and hunger. \r\nToday’s commemoration is a timely reminder of the \r\npower of these Covenants to ensure that States uphold \r\nthe rights of all their people.\r\nAs Governments, civil society and the global public \r\nfocus on ramping up implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, the mutually reinforcing \r\nnature of the pillars of human rights, peace and security \r\nand development could not be clearer. When people’s \r\nhuman rights are violated, when they live in fear, \r\nwhen they are affected by conflict and violence, when \r\nthey are subject to discrimination, marginalization, \r\nintolerance, poverty and corruption, neither sustainable \r\ndevelopment nor sustainable peace is attainable.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

In taking a \r\ncomprehensive and integrated approach to development, \r\nthe 2030 Agenda encapsulates the indivisibility and \r\ninterdependence of the human rights set forth in both \r\nCovenants. An effective implementation of the Agenda \r\nrequires that this be done in a manner consistent with \r\nthe United Nations Charter, international treaties and \r\ninternational law. Done the right way, work to achieve \r\nthe 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda and the \r\nHuman Rights Covenants will have to proceed hand in \r\nhand.\r\nIndeed, the mantra of the 2030 Agenda of leaving no \r\none behind recalls the principles of non-discrimination \r\nand equality that underlie the two Covenants. Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 16 — promoting peaceful and \r\ninclusive societies, access to justice and effective and \r\naccountable institutions — is fundamental to achieving \r\nsuccess under all of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nI call on all Member States that have yet to ratify \r\neither or both Covenants to take the opportunity of \r\nthis commemorative year to do so. The promotion \r\nand protection of human rights is a commitment that \r\nrequires constant vigilance by us all. Allow me here to \r\nquote John Donne’s celebrated verse:\r\n“Any man’s death diminishes me,\r\nbecause I am involved in mankind,\r\nAnd therefore never send to know for whom\r\nthe bell tolls; it tolls for thee.”\r\nThese words ring as true today as when they were written \r\n400 years ago. Let us therefore mark the occasion of the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Covenants by \r\nreaffirming our commitment to realizing the rights of \r\nall people, protecting those who are suffering injustice, \r\nfighting xenophobia, intolerance and discrimination, \r\npromoting equality and empowerment and increasing \r\nglobal awareness and understanding of human rights as \r\nfundamental to all lives. There is much we can do better \r\nin our efforts to realize political, economical and social \r\nrights of mankind. And in doing so, we will do well to \r\naim for greater respect and stronger implementation of \r\nthe two Covenants we celebrate today.\r\nI now give the f loor to the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral, His Excellency Mr. Jan Eliasson.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: I am honoured to \r\njoin the members of the Assembly today in marking a \r\ntruly momentous occasion and to convey a message of \r\nsupport from Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon.\r\nHalf a century ago, the General Assembly adopted \r\nthe two International Human Rights Covenants, \r\ncompleting the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nto form the International Bill of Human Rights. This \r\nmarked the beginning of a global constitution of human \r\nrights protection. The adoption galvanized the consensus \r\nview that the protection and realization of human rights \r\nis fundamental to building resilient, inclusive and \r\npeaceful societies, as the President just stated. The \r\nCovenants have inspired international human rights \r\ninstruments and influenced national constitutions the \r\nworld over. They have guided national and regional \r\ncourts and provided a normative foundation for the \r\nwork of national independent human rights institutions. \r\nThey have confirmed a common universal language of \r\nhuman rights, at the heart of which remains the right \r\nto life. The abolition of the death penalty has advanced \r\nsignificantly, but we must step up our efforts towards \r\nending this inhumane practice of executions once and \r\nfor all.\r\nOn another level, the Human Rights Committee \r\nand the Committee on Economic, Social and Cultural \r\nRights remind States parties to the two Covenants that \r\nthey have to account publicly for their human rights \r\nperformance. The Committees are crucial for the support \r\nand guidance of States in their implementation of human \r\nrights. They also help victims in many countries to seek \r\nremedies when rights are breached. Our aim must be \r\nthe universal ratification of the Covenants, including \r\nthe right of petition under their Optional Protocols and \r\ntheir full and effective realization for all people.\r\n Regrettably, serious human rights violations \r\nremain a huge challenge. I refer here to all human \r\nrights: political, civil, economic, social and cultural. I \r\nthink of protecting civil liberties in the fight against \r\nterrorism and violent extremism; of preventing \r\nfamine; of upholding social protection even in troubled \r\neconomic times; of respecting religious freedom, \r\ntolerance and freedom from discrimination for all, \r\nincluding migrants; of shielding everyone from all \r\nforms of violence, especially women and children; and \r\nof creating space for free speech, for free media and \r\nfor human rights defenders to act without intimidation.\r\nIn a world of widespread suffering, war, poverty \r\nand discrimination, the fiftieth anniversary is an \r\nappropriate moment to rally around the Covenants’ \r\n19/10/2016 A/71/PV.30\r\n16-33261 3/10\r\nprinciples and vision. The Covenants remind us how \r\nthe carnage stemming from conflict and blatant \r\ndisrespect for human rights and humanitarian law is \r\nutterly inexcusable. They admonish us to never accept \r\nextreme poverty, intolerance, inequality or injustices.\r\nWe have more knowledge, tools and even resources \r\nnow than ever before. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment provides us with a global blueprint to \r\nimplement the Covenants in a broader and deeper sense. \r\nThe Covenants in turn support stronger accountability \r\nin respect of the Sustainable Development Goals. In \r\nparallel, the United Nations Human Rights Up Front \r\ninitiative aims to enhance the ability of the United \r\nNations system to prevent and respond in a timely \r\nfashion to serious human rights violations before they \r\nturn into mass atrocities, as we have seen occur in so \r\nmany cases.\r\nAll human rights are universal, interrelated, \r\ninalienable and indivisible. They form the bedrock of \r\na humane world. Let us reaffirm this vision and turn it \r\ninto realities in all corners of the world. Let us pledge to \r\nstrengthen our political commitment to the Covenants: \r\nto guarantee freedom from fear and freedom from want \r\nand to protect human rights for all.\r\nThe President: I thank the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his statement.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I should like to consult \r\nmembers with a view to inviting the following speakers \r\nto make statements on this occasion, as mentioned in \r\nmy letter dated 6 October 2016: Mr. Zeid Ra’ad Al \r\nHussein, United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights; Mr. Fabián Omar Salvioli, Chair of the Human \r\nRights Committee; and Mr. Waleed Sadi, Chair of the \r\nCommittee on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.\r\nIf there is no objection, may I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly, without setting a \r\nprecedent, to invite these speakers to make statements \r\nat this commemorative meeting?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision \r\njust taken, I now give the f loor to Mr. Zeid Ra’ad Al \r\nHussein, United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights.\r\nMr. Al Hussein (United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights): Half a century ago, our forebears \r\nin this Assembly unanimously adopted two great \r\ncovenants and brought the force of law to the principles \r\nlaid out in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. \r\nThose covenants distilled the bitter lessons learnt from \r\nwarfare, genocide, colonial oppression and economic \r\ndevastation into a legal code, creating a blueprint to \r\nbuild a different, more just and peaceful world.\r\nPerhaps never in the history of the United Nations \r\nhas it been so important to recall that the human rights \r\nprinciples embodied in the International Covenant on \r\nCivil and Political Rights and the International Covenant \r\non Economic Social and Cultural Rights provide the \r\nfoundation on which to build justice, prosperity and \r\npeace, both among and within nations; on which to \r\nbuild opportunities and ensure that every individual and \r\nevery society can develop to their full potential; and on \r\nwhich to build justice and respect for diverse opinions, \r\norigins and faiths. At a time of deepening turmoil, with \r\nrising antagonism and increasingly callous disregard \r\nfor the human suffering generated by conflict and \r\ndeprivation, we can take stock of the world we have \r\nbuilt as a result of these binding agreements, their \r\nfundamental wisdom and humanity and their promise \r\nof a safer, fairer future. We can fulfil their pledge.\r\nAll the world’s people have a right to life and to be \r\nfree of torture, slavery and discrimination. They have \r\na right to freedom of religion, freedom of speech and \r\nfreedom of assembly. They have electoral rights and \r\nthe right to a fair trial. They have a right to education, \r\nto an adequate standard of living, to fair wages and to \r\nsafe working conditions. They have a right to decent \r\nhousing, to the highest attainable standard of health, \r\nand to adequate protection when they are vulnerable \r\nby virtue of age, sickness or accident. These are not \r\nempty words, but rights. Every State represented in \r\nthis Hall has sworn to be accountable to its people in \r\nensuring these rights are respected. They are universal, \r\nindivisible, interdependent and interrelated. They are \r\ninterlocking, and the societies they build are resilient \r\nand strong.\r\nThe Covenants have been a lifeline for millions of \r\nwomen, men and children over the past 50 years. They \r\nhave helped to shape the constitutions of many nations \r\nrepresented in this Hall, and they are deeply grounded \r\nin their laws. They have taught us to turn away from \r\ndiscrimination, whether based on race, gender, ethnicity, \r\nreligious faith, political opinion, sexual orientation \r\nor any other characteristic. They have shown us how \r\nto build rule-of-law institutions that are impartial, \r\ntransparent and accessible. They have demonstrated \r\nA/71/PV.30 19/10/2016\r\n4/10 16-33261\r\nthat policy can be securely anchored in the expressed \r\nwill of the people when there is greater freedom.\r\nThe Covenants continue to bear fruit. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change both draw deeply from \r\ntheir power — the drive to end discrimination on any \r\ngrounds and to build governance that is grounded in \r\ncivil, political, economic, social and cultural rights. \r\nThis structure of law and principle is our most \r\nprecious inheritance from past generations, and it is the \r\nmost valuable legacy we can pass on to our children. \r\nDag Hammarskjóld said: \r\n“To build for man a world without fear, we must \r\nbe without fear. To build a world of justice, we must be \r\njust.” \r\nHe also said:\r\n“The pursuit of peace and progress, with its \r\ntrials and its errors, its successes and its setbacks, \r\ncan never be relaxed and never abandoned.”\r\nWill it be our generation that breaks away from \r\nthe human rights principles drawn up to save the world \r\nfrom the horror of the past? Will it be we who set off \r\nthat return to injustice, hate, war, imperialism and the \r\nexploitive and oppressive exercise of naked power? \r\nIn a tide of hatred and divisiveness, deep and vital \r\nprinciples may be swept away unheeded. The world’s \r\nStates cannot durably address poverty, climate change, \r\nmigration, conflicts or terrorism without effective \r\ninternational cooperation in a system that upholds \r\nhuman dignity and equality. There will be no peace, \r\ndevelopment, safety or future if we ignore the rights of \r\nthe people — all the world’s people.\r\nWe cannot know what crises the next 50 years \r\nwill bring. But when institutions do not protect the \r\npeople or guard against injustice, or when they fail to \r\nshare common resources equitably and safeguard the \r\npeople’s rights, social cohesion is shattered and the \r\nrisk of division and violence is high. States can set our \r\nshared planet on a course of greater inclusion, more \r\nsustained prosperity and more justice, dignity, freedom \r\nand peace. States can embrace the voices of the people \r\nrather than cutting short that most precious resource.\r\nThe Covenants, through the excellent work of \r\nthe Human Rights Committee and the Committee on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, continue to \r\nguide States and assist individuals in seeking remedies \r\nfor violations. In today’s troubled global context, \r\nthe treaty body system is sorely needed. I encourage \r\nthe Assembly to act on the recommendations of the \r\nSecretary-General in the report before us (A/71/118) in \r\norder to ensure that the treaty bodies can provide the \r\nmost effective support possible. \r\nHuman rights offer States a path towards greater \r\nstability, not less. They ensure that disputes can be \r\npeacefully resolved, and they can build confidence, \r\nloyalty and thriving political and economic institutions. \r\nThe most effective way to create societies that are \r\ncohesive and resilient is to build justice, dignity, \r\nequality and development, in a system that protects the \r\nfull human rights of every individual.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary of the Covenants must \r\nbe an occasion to reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nInternational Bill of Human Rights, the great tripod of \r\nprinciple and commitment that is formed by the two \r\nCovenants and the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. Those texts are the bedrock of sound governance \r\nand in them lives the world’s hope for peace.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision \r\njust taken, I now call on the Chair of the Human \r\nRights Committee.\r\nMr. Salvioli (Human Rights Committee) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): I would like to commend you, \r\nMr. President, and the General Assembly for the \r\ndecision to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \r\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social \r\nand Cultural Rights. I would also like to warmly thank \r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General, my friend the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and my \r\ncolleague Mr. Waleed Sadi, Chair of the Committee on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights.\r\nToday’s commemoration of the anniversary of the \r\ntwo International Covenants on Human Rights is a very \r\nsignificant moment in history. Half a century ago, in \r\na moving meeting in this very Hall, we witnessed the \r\nadoption of both instruments and the first Optional \r\nProtocol to the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights. The then President of the General \r\nAssembly, in 1966, said with great clarity that universal \r\nrespect for human rights is inseparable from the idea of \r\nworld peace, that therefore the steps taken in the field \r\nof human rights must be made effective and that States \r\nshould participate in the new Covenants universally \r\nand without reservations (see A/PV.1496). At the same \r\n19/10/2016 A/71/PV.30\r\n16-33261 5/10\r\nmeeting the then Secretary-General stressed the fact \r\nthat the two Covenants were approved unanimously, in \r\na demonstration of the political maturity and positive \r\nleadership that existed at the time.\r\nFifty years have passed since then. As of today, 168 \r\nStates have ratified the International Covenant on Civil \r\nand Political Rights; 115 have ratified its first Optional \r\nProtocol, empowering the Human Rights Committee to \r\nreceive, process and resolve individual communications; \r\nand 81 have ratified its second Optional Protocol, \r\non the abolition of the death penalty. Those numbers \r\nare evidence of our progress and of States’ growing \r\nwillingnes to commit to civil and political rights.\r\nSince 1977, the Human Rights Committee has been \r\ncomplying with its task of interpreting and applying \r\nthe Covenant. Over those four decades, it has made a \r\nsignificant contribution to the case law on civil and \r\npolitical rights, thereby promoting the development \r\nof international human rights law to the benefit of \r\nindividuals. By the process of reviewing the reports \r\nof States, the Committee, through its concluding \r\nobservations, has carried out effective public scrutiny \r\nof legislation, policies and practices of the various State \r\norgans.\r\nThe Committee also interprets and applies the \r\nCovenant through its examination of individual \r\ncommunications. To date, it has received about 2,760 \r\ncomplaints and considered more than 1,150. The quality \r\nof the Committee’s jurisprudence is recognized at every \r\nlevel and is taken into account by national, regional and \r\ninternational courts, including the International Court \r\nof Justice, which in its judgment in the Diallo case said \r\nthat great weight should be given to the Committee’s \r\ninterpretation of the Covenant. Other bodies of \r\nindependent experts, including the intergovernmental \r\nHuman Rights Council, also use the documents that the \r\nCommittee adopts to carry its work forward.\r\nThroughout this period, we have been able to arrive \r\nat best practices for implementing our concluding \r\nobservations and investigations, which have been greatly \r\nassisted by the Committee’s follow-up procedures, the \r\nwork of national human rights institutions and of course \r\nby civil society organizations. But none of that would \r\nbe possible if we could not depend on the political will \r\nof the States.\r\nThe general comments, in which the Committee \r\ninterprets the Covenant’s provisions, documents \r\nthat serve as a useful guide for States, are another \r\nimportant achievement. To date, we have adopted 35 \r\ngeneral comments, and we are drafting a new one on \r\nthe right to life, with broad participation by States and \r\nnon-governmental organizations. Those achievements \r\nhave been made possible by the excellent work that has \r\nbeen done by the women and men on the Committee, \r\nthroughout its history and today, with expertise, \r\ncommitment and outstanding quality. I would like to \r\ntake this opportunity to express my admiration for \r\nthem and to offer my sincere and heartfelt tribute and \r\nacknowledgement to my colleagues, past and present.\r\nThere are great challenges ahead of us in an \r\nenormously complex world. The International \r\nCovenants and the Committees’ decisions represent \r\nan outstanding road map to a better future for our \r\nsocieties. It is urgent that we regain those values of \r\ninterdependence and indivisibility and end our biased \r\napproaches to analysing social, civil, economic, \r\npolitical and cultural rights. In our judicial acts we must \r\nreject artificial categories and leave behind nineteenth-\r\ncentury principles. The guiding criteria for our actions \r\nshould be a people-centred perspective and the full \r\nwealth of international human rights law. There is \r\ntherefore no reason for not having universal ratification \r\nof the Covenants. States should become parties to them \r\nand their Protocols without delay or reservations.\r\nStates should submit reports on time; act in \r\ngood faith in proceedings; encourage civil society’s \r\nparticipation; and establish internal mechanisms for \r\nquick and effective compliance with the concluding \r\nobservations and expert opinions of the Human \r\nRights Committee and the Committee on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights. They should propose the \r\nbest-qualified people — expert, independent and \r\nimpartial — as candidates for the Committees. Those \r\nqualities, along with equitable geographical distribution \r\nand gender balance, are the only ones that should guide \r\nthe election process. States should actively support the \r\nwork of the Committees, in word and deed, defend their \r\nimpartiality and functions and provide the secretariats \r\nwith the resources they need to fulfil their mandates.\r\nIt is decided, firm, permanent measures such as \r\nthese, taken in every area, that are the best tribute to \r\nthe International Covenants and to the people who had \r\nthe foresight and the courage to formulate and adopt \r\nthem. Using their expertise, the Committees must \r\ninterpret and apply them with a view to achieving their \r\nuniversality, interdependence and indivisibility, while \r\nthose here, the States Members of the United Nations, \r\nA/71/PV.30 19/10/2016\r\n6/10 16-33261\r\nhave the great privilege of formulating and executing \r\nthe public policy that can render them effective for the \r\nbenefit of humankind.\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision \r\njust taken, I now call on the Chair of the Committee on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights.\r\nMr. Sadi (Committee on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights): We are assembled here today to \r\ncommemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof two key human rights covenants: the International \r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights \r\nand its twin, the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights. I emphasize the word “twin” because I \r\nbelieve that ultimately they are inseparable.\r\nThe narrative of the adoption of the two basic \r\nhuman rights instruments shows beyond the shadow of \r\na doubt — and we must not lose sight of the fact — that \r\nthey complement one another, in every sense of the \r\nword, and that they were delivered in order to give \r\nfull expression to the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights of 1948. The Declaration did not deal separately \r\nwith the two dimensions of human rights, but rather \r\njointly, affirming that for all intents and purposes the \r\ntwo Covenants are indeed inseparable. A close friend \r\nof mine once said that they are more or less like the two \r\nwings of the same bird, which cannot f ly without both. \r\nI hope we can all remember that example, simple and \r\nyet to the point. Who are we to challenge this  article \r\nof faith, which the Declaration embodied and espoused, \r\nthat they are inseparable and indivisible?\r\nWe all now adhere faithfully to the proposition that \r\nhuman rights are interdependent and inseparable from \r\none another. On that basis alone, the two Covenants, \r\nwhich aim to address civil and political rights in \r\nconjunction with economic, social and cultural rights, \r\ncannot fulfil their mandates separately from one \r\nanother for much longer. Last summer, we made a \r\nmodest move, with the two Committees meeting jointly, \r\nand I hope that modest move will be repeated vis-à-vis \r\nthe other treaty bodies, because if we are faithful to the \r\nproposition that human rights are indivisible, we must \r\npursue them in a joint, coordinated and cooperative \r\nmanner. I am afraid that we are not yet on that road, \r\nbut in the modest move we made last summer, our two \r\nCommittees held hands and tried to see where they \r\ncould have better coordination and cooperation.\r\nWe in the Committee on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights have repeatedly seen that the sets of \r\nrights that we are trying to promote and protect cannot \r\nbe fully realized without taking into consideration their \r\ncivil and political contexts. And I submit that that goes \r\nfor every treaty body we have. They all have the same \r\nneed for more coordination and cooperation. We have \r\nmade a modest move in that direction, but I think we \r\nshould do it faster and more boldly in the future. By \r\nway of example, one cannot enjoy the rights to food, \r\nwork, housing, education, health and culture if one’s \r\npolitical and civil environment is not adequate and \r\nconducive to their enjoyment. The denial of one set of \r\nrights will frustrate and impede the realization of and \r\nrespect for the other sets.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to invite all \r\ncountries that have not yet ratified the International \r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights to \r\ndo so. We have 164 member States. I would like to make \r\na special appeal to the United States, which has almost \r\nalone stayed out of this club, and which I fear sends the \r\nwrong signal. I hope that through this forum, perhaps, \r\nthe United States can be invited in. I hope the United \r\nStates delegation is here this morning and can make an \r\neffort to join the rest of the international community in \r\nbecoming a party to our treaty.\r\nI hope today’s commemoration will serve our \r\nultimate purpose. My single and most important \r\nmessage is to urge that we have greater collaboration \r\nand cooperation between the two treaty bodies, \r\nbecause otherwise I believe we will be going in the \r\nwrong direction.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of \r\nKuwait, who will speak on behalf of the Group of Asia-\r\nPacific States.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait): I am honoured to speak \r\ntoday on behalf of the Group of Asia-Pacific States at \r\nour commemoration of the fiftieth anniversary of the \r\nadoption of the International Covenant on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights and the International Covenant on \r\nEconomic, Social and Cultural Rights, as called for in \r\nGeneral Assembly resolution 70/144 under the agenda \r\nitem entitled “Promotion and protection of human \r\nrights”. Both the International Covenant on Civil \r\nand Political Rights and the International Covenant \r\non Economic, Social and Cultural Rights are just as \r\nsignificant today as they were at their adoption in 1966.\r\nThe Covenants’ foundation is the recognition that \r\nevery human being has human rights, and that it is \r\nthe obligation of each State to promote and preserve \r\n19/10/2016 A/71/PV.30\r\n16-33261 7/10\r\nthose rights. Since their inception 50 years ago, both \r\nCovenants have continued to reflect ideals and goals that \r\nwe have never ceased to desire to achieve. Moreover, \r\ngiven the continued conflicts going on around the world, \r\nresulting in a staggering total of 65.3 million refugees \r\nand internally displaced persons, we are currently \r\nfacing the most challenging of struggles. Never has \r\nthe desire for peace and security been so evident. All \r\nStates are encouraged to implement the goals that both \r\nof these Covenants embody and to continue to aspire to \r\na world free of fearand violence.\r\nThe fiftieth anniversary serves as a reminder of the \r\nobligation to protect and defend each individual’s basic \r\nhuman rights and to commit to taking administrative \r\nand legislative measures to preserve those rights, as \r\nstated in the treaties, thereby reinforcing the aspirations \r\nof each and every human being to live in dignity, peace \r\nand security, as we all rightly deserve.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Georgia, who will speak on behalf of \r\nthe Group of Eastern European States.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): It is my honour to take the \r\nf loor on behalf of the Group of Eastern European States \r\nto join our voices in celebration of the fiftieth anniversary \r\nof the adoption of the International Covenant on Civil \r\nand Political Rights and the International Covenant \r\non Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. These two \r\nCovenants, together with the Universal Declaration of \r\nHuman Rights, form a major cornerstone of international \r\nhuman rights law. We welcome the holding of this \r\ntimely meeting to once again underscore the universal, \r\ninalienable, interdependent and indivisible nature of all \r\nhuman rights set forth in the Covenants.\r\nThe Eastern European States reaffirm their strong \r\ncommitment to the Covenants, which represent an \r\nessential tool for the fulfilment of the human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms of all individuals. We recall the \r\nprimary responsibility of States to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nFifty years ago, the Covenants set out the civil, \r\ncultural, economic, political and social rights that are \r\nthe birthright of all human beings. During the past \r\nfive decades, the world has dramatically changed. \r\nThe increasing threats and pressing challenges facing \r\nus today — including the spread of international \r\nterrorism, racial, ethnic and religious intolerance and \r\nthe migration crisis — once again underline the role \r\nof the international community in ensuring the better \r\nprotection of human rights.\r\nToday, as we reflect on the significant progress \r\nachieved since the adoption of the Covenants, we \r\nhave to note that challenges remain in securing \r\nbasic human rights and freedoms for all. Millions of \r\npeople, especially children, women and persons with \r\ndisabilities, continue to suffer from various forms \r\nof violence, discrimination, exploitation and abuse. \r\nThousands still suffer from grave human rights \r\nviolations during conflicts, and in that regard, we use \r\nthis opportunity to underline the importance of the \r\nwork of the relevant treaty bodies, such as the Human \r\nRights Committee and the Committee on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights.\r\nWe strongly believe that every individual deserves \r\nto enjoy both sets of rights covered by the Covenants \r\nwithout any discrimination on any ground, such as \r\nrace, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other \r\nopinion, national or social origin, property, birth or \r\nother status. Special attention should be paid to the \r\nmost vulnerable groups.\r\nWe share the view that the fundamental human \r\nrights enshrined in the Covenants should be applied \r\nequally to everyone. We need to take more effective \r\nsteps to protect the human rights of all, and this \r\nlandmark occasion gives us an opportunity to call on all \r\nStates to ensure the universal ratification and effective \r\nimplementation of both Covenants. In that regard, we \r\nappreciate the year-long “Our Rights. Our Freedoms. \r\nAlways” campaign of the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights to promote and \r\nraise awareness on both Covenants.\r\nAs we embark on the ambitious 15-year journey \r\ntowards the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, it is important that we strive \r\nto achieve its goals as a major factor contributing to \r\nthe promotion of human rights, including through \r\nthe implementation of States’ obligations under \r\nthe Covenants.\r\nOn behalf of the Eastern European States, we would \r\nlike to once again reiterate our strong commitment to \r\nensuring the full protection of all human rights.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Chile, who will speak on behalf of the \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States.\r\nA/71/PV.30 19/10/2016\r\n8/10 16-33261\r\nMr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Group of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(GRULAC), on whose behalf I am speaking, is \r\nparticularly pleased to participate in this fiftieth-\r\nanniversary commemoration of the adoption by the \r\nGeneral Assembly of the International Covenant \r\non Civil and Political Rights and the International \r\nCovenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. \r\nThose instruments, together with the 1948 Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights and other international \r\nhuman rights treaties, set out the essential foundation \r\nof the rights and fundamental freedoms to be enjoyed \r\nby all human beings simply because they are human.\r\nThe International Covenants on Human Rights \r\nhave achieved global significance and relevance. They \r\nreinforce the universal, indivisible, interdependent and \r\nmutually supportive nature of all human rights. Respect \r\nfor and the promotion and implementation of those \r\ninstruments is a primary duty of every State party, \r\nand a source of legitimate interest to the international \r\ncommunity. Their implementation requires and benefits \r\nfrom a cooperative approach that can be fostered \r\nby universal and regional human rights systems, \r\nparticularly as regards building and strengthening the \r\ncapacities needed to make progress in their compliance.\r\nHuman rights are recognized as one of the three \r\nbasic pillars of the United Nations and are closely \r\nand directly linked to development and international \r\npeace and security. There are all too many examples \r\ndemonstrating that a serious and systematic pattern of \r\nhuman rights violations can undermine international \r\npeace and stability, and that if we do not ensure and \r\ndefend the dignity of all persons without exception in \r\nthe face of violence, intolerance and exclusion, we will \r\nundermine efforts to effectively guarantee the rights \r\nenshrined in the International Human Rights Covenants \r\nand the work of the organs responsible for monitoring \r\ntheir implementation.\r\nThe International Covenants on Human Rights \r\nrespond to the conviction that peace is very difficult \r\nto maintain or achieve without a decent standard of \r\nliving for all commensurate with human dignity. We \r\nrecognize that through those international instruments \r\nit is of the utmost importance to protect the right to life \r\nand personal integrity, promote individual economic \r\nsecurity, and ensure that everyone can enjoy all their \r\nfundamental freedoms as elements of paramount \r\nimportance to personal and social development. This \r\nmeans that poverty, inequality and inadequate access \r\nto food, health, education, housing and justice deprive \r\npeople of the opportunity to develop their full potential.\r\nIn that conviction, the countries of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean place equal emphasis on the critical \r\nimportance of all civil, political, economic, social and \r\ncultural human rights, and on the concomittant duty \r\nof all States to respect and promote them, allocating \r\nthe resources necessary to build peaceful and inclusive \r\nsocieties that ensure prosperity and peace. In that \r\nregard, we also emphasize that the right to development \r\nis an integral part of the human rights corpus, for which \r\nour Organization must work tirelessly.\r\nThat vision is reflected in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, adopted last year, which \r\nincorporates a human rights-based approach and \r\nrecognizes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nand international human rights treaties as a cross-\r\ncutting element essential to balanced attainment \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals, which were \r\nestablished in order to leave no one behind.\r\nNow that our world is strongly interconnected as a \r\nresult of development, progress, science, transportation \r\nand information technologies, States must work with \r\nall relevant stakeholders — including civil society \r\norganizations, businesses, academia and national \r\nhuman rights institutions, among others — in order \r\nto build a better response to common human rights \r\nchallenges. A shared commitment to enhancing these \r\nuniversally recognized human rights for all is therefore \r\nessential.\r\nIn the same vein, one priority for GRULAC \r\nis and will continue to be to provide assistance \r\nand implement measures to effectively protect and \r\npromote the human rights of vulnerable persons and \r\ngroups so as to fully realize all rights enshrined in the \r\nInternational Covenants and other international human \r\nrights instruments, paying particular attention to the \r\nempowerment of women and girls, the promotion of \r\ngender equality, and the rights of children, persons \r\nwith disabilities, indigenous peoples, people of African \r\ndescent, migrants and the elderly, among others, in \r\norder to ensure that all human beings can live in a region \r\nand a world with greater equality, justice, security and \r\nwell-being. \r\nDespite the magnitude of the challenges that \r\nwe face on this anniversary, the countries of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean renew their determination \r\n19/10/2016 A/71/PV.30\r\n16-33261 9/10\r\nand their profound commitment as they pursue this \r\nnoble endeavour.\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the representative \r\nof the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern \r\nIreland, who will speak on behalf of the Group of \r\nWestern European and other States.\r\nMr. Wilson (United Kingdom): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the Group of Western European \r\nand other States. \r\nThis year marks the fiftieth anniversary since the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and \r\nthe International Covenant on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights were conceived and 40 years since they \r\nentered into force. In conjunction with the Universal \r\nDeclaration on Human Rights, the Covenants marked \r\na turning point in the formal recognition by States of \r\nthe rights of the individual, that every person is born \r\nwith equal rights — civil, political, cultural, economic \r\nand social — and should be able to exercise those rights \r\nwithout fear of persecution or oppression. \r\nThe anniversary of the Covenants is a time to \r\ntake stock of the global human rights situation and to \r\njoin our common efforts. In too many States human \r\nrights are under threat, and the fight against terrorism \r\nor cultural relativism is used to justify human rights \r\nviolations. In that context, our responsibility is to \r\ndefend the universality of human rights enshrined in \r\nthe international treaties that we uphold.\r\nThe significance of the Covenants is self evident. \r\nToday, the most unstable and insecure regions around the \r\nglobe are those where the principles enshrined in both \r\nthe International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \r\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social \r\nand Cultural Rights are either neglected or opposed, \r\nwhere inequality and prejudice are most prominent and \r\nwhere oppression is rife. People expect accountability \r\nfrom their Governments and freedom and dignity \r\nfor themselves. We must work together — national \r\nGovernments, international organizations and civil \r\nsociety — to protect and strengthen human rights. Let \r\nus also consider how we work with Governments that \r\nare yet to sign or ratify the Covenants.\r\nThe International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights and the the International Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights remain as important today as \r\nwhen they were adopted. We are committed to working \r\nto ensure that those rights continue to be upheld and \r\nthat we hold ourselves and each other to the highest \r\npossible standard. That can be achieved only through \r\ndeeper cooperation with one another, with civil society \r\nand with the accountability mechanisms enshrined in \r\ninternational treaties. Fulfilling the rights set out in the \r\nCovenants is too important to be left to chance.\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the representative \r\nof the United States of America, who will speak on \r\nbehalf of the host country.\r\nMs. Mendelson (United States of America): As \r\nhas been noted by many, human rights is a core pillar \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. In the Preamble \r\nof the Charter, the Member States “reaffirm faith in \r\nfundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of \r\nthe human person and in the equal rights of men and \r\nwomen and of nations large and small”.\r\nThe Universal Declaration and the International \r\nCovenants on Human Rights are central to achieving \r\nthat mission. Upon the adoption of the Universal \r\nDeclaration on Human Rights, Eleanor Roosevelt \r\nremarked,\r\n“As we here bring to fruition our labours on \r\nthis Declaration of Human Rights, we must at the \r\nsame time rededicate ourselves to the unfinished \r\ntask which lies before us.”\r\nOver the next several years, the international \r\ncommunity then worked together to negotiate the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \r\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social \r\nand Cultural Rights, work which was concluded in \r\n1966. It is the reason why we celebrate today. In \r\nsigning the International Covenants in 1977, President \r\nCarter observed that when a Government ratifies the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \r\nit acknowledges “explicitly that there are sharp \r\nlimits on its own powers over the lives of its people”. \r\nThe International Covenant on Economic, Social \r\nand Cultural Rights, meanwhile, recognizes that \r\nGovernments are the instruments and servants of their \r\npeople. \r\nBoth these Covenants express values in which the \r\npeople of my country have believed for a long time. As \r\nwe mark this occasion today, the United States supports \r\nthe goals of the International Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights and strongly reaffirms our \r\ncommitment to the International Covenant on Civil \r\nand Political Rights. The United States reiterates its \r\nA/71/PV.30 19/10/2016\r\n10/10 16-33261\r\ncommitment to human rights in its work in the General \r\nAssembly, within the Human Rights Council and \r\nacross the many other bodies promoting the protection \r\nof human rights within the United Nations.\r\nA decade ago, we were one of the strongest \r\nsupporters of the universal periodic review process, \r\nand we remain fully committed to its vital function of \r\nguiding Member States to improve respect for human \r\nrights domestically. We see that process as extremely \r\nvaluable, given its universality. It reviews the human \r\nrights situation in every country, including our own.\r\nThe United States developed six working groups \r\ntasked to review and consult with civil society on a \r\nrange of human rights issues — including civil rights \r\nand non-discrimination; criminal justice; economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights; indigenous issues and the \r\nenvironment; national security; immigration, labour, \r\nmigrants, trafficking, and children — and domestic \r\nimplementation and international mechanisms.\r\nGiven that the global trend of closing space for \r\ncivil society threatens the very rights created by the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, \r\nI want to highlight the important roles of the Special \r\nRapporteurs on the rights to freedom of peaceful \r\nassembly and association, freedom of expression and the \r\nsituation of human rights defenders. All three mandates \r\nare crucial to protecting and promoting the international \r\nhuman rights obligations in the Covenant. We are \r\ncommitted to the implementation of our obligations \r\nunder the International Covenant on Civil and Political \r\nRights because it helps create the environment most \r\nconducive for steady progress toward the achievement \r\nof the goals of the International Covenant on Economic, \r\nSocial and Cultural Rights.\r\nExperience reveals that when people can exercise \r\nfundamental freedoms of expression, peaceful \r\nassembly, association, and religion or belief without \r\nfear; when they have access to a wide range of ideas, \r\ninformation and opinion; when they can actively \r\nparticipate in the political life of their country and press \r\nfor reform without reprisal; when laws are instruments \r\nof justice and not tools of repression; when journalists \r\nand advocates can expose abuse and corruption; and \r\nwhen domestic safeguards protect minorities from the \r\npotential tyranny of a Government that fails to guarantee \r\nfree expression, to respect the will of its people, and to \r\nprotect the interests of all individuals equally without \r\ndistinction, then societies become more resilient, more \r\ninclusive and more tolerant, innovation spurs economic \r\ngrowth and prosperity, and political change tends to \r\nbe peaceful.\r\nToday, as we commemorate the Covenants and \r\nthe hard work of all of those who contributed to their \r\ncreation, we remind ourselves about the current state \r\nof the world and the threats to the International Bill \r\nof Rights. We must work together to ensure that the \r\nhuman rights treaty bodies, the Human Rights Council \r\nand other human rights mechanisms within the United \r\nNations are effective and enable respect for human \r\nrights worldwide.\r\nFinally, the United States reaffirms its commitment \r\nto advancing and supporting human rights in the \r\nUnited Nations system and advancing human rights, \r\nfundamental freedoms, human dignity and prosperity \r\ninternationally and in the United States.\r\nThe President: The Assembly has thus concluded \r\nthe commemorative meeting to mark the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of the International \r\nCovenant on Civil and Political Rights and the \r\nInternational Covenant on Economic, Social and \r\nCultural Rights.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of sub-item (a) of agenda item \r\n68.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.10 a.m.\r\n"
