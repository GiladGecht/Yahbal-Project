"United Nations A/71/PV.31\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n31st plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 20 October 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 119\r\nCommemoration of the abolition of slavery and the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/170)\r\nThe President: The scale of the human suffering \r\ncaused by the transatlantic slave trade is an affront \r\nto humankind’s conscience. For over 400 years, this \r\nreprehensible practice continued and was the largest \r\nforced migration in human history. More than 15 million \r\nmen, women and children, forced against their will to \r\nleave their homes, families and communities, were \r\nvictims of this inhumane and barbaric system. Many \r\nlost their lives as the slave ships crossed the Atlantic \r\nOcean, and those who survived were forced to endure \r\nlives of humiliation and brutality.\r\nWhile people were bought and sold like \r\ncommodities, human dignity was stripped from all \r\nconcerned. Forced to work under deplorable conditions \r\non plantations, in textile mills and factories, slaves \r\nsuffered while others built their fortunes on the back \r\nof this miserable system. The commitment of Member \r\nStates to ensuring that humankind does not forget this \r\ndark time of human history is to be commended.\r\nThe declaration of 25 March as the International \r\nDay of Remembrance of the Victims of Slavery and \r\nthe Transatlantic Slave Trade and the establishment \r\nof a permanent memorial — The Ark of Return — at \r\nHeadquarters serve as permanent reminders. They help \r\nto educate us and future generations of the horrors of \r\nthe transatlantic slave trade.\r\nModern forms of slavery plague our world today, \r\nincluding human trafficking, forced labour and child \r\nlabour. The memory of the transatlantic slave trade \r\ngives us a huge moral imperative to effectively combat \r\nmodern slavery. That includes providing productive \r\nemployment and decent work for all, in line with \r\nthe provisions of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Also in memory of the slave trade, racism, \r\nracial discrimination, xenophobia and intolerance must \r\nbe overcome whenever and wherever we find it.\r\nThe historical struggle of enslaved people for \r\nfreedom and equality took great courage, hope and \r\ndetermination. These qualities, exercised by a long-\r\noppressed people, inspire us today as we work to combat \r\ninequality and exploitation. The eventual achievement \r\nof emancipation gives us strength today in the enduring \r\nhuman aspiration and defence of freedom.\r\nMr. Webson (Antigua and Barbuda): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the member States of the \r\nCaribbean Community (CARICOM).\r\nCARICOM would like to thank the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report (A/71/170) entitled “Permanent \r\nmemorial to and remembrance of the victims of slavery \r\nand the transatlantic slave trade: status of the United \r\nNations Trust Fund for Partnerships — Permanent \r\nMemorial”. We also take note and acknowledge in \r\nparticular the decision set forth in paragraph 6 of \r\nresolution 69/19, recalled in the Secretary-General’s \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-33413 (E)\r\n*1633413*\r\nA/71/PV.31 20/10/2016\r\n2/7 16-33413\r\nreport, to use any funds remaining in the Trust Fund \r\nfor the maintenance of the memorial.\r\nWe also would like to express our profound \r\ngratitude to the Secretary-General for the excellent \r\nmanagement of the funds, and to our partners across \r\nthe various regional groups within the United Nations \r\nfor their support for the CARICOM initiative to erect a \r\npermanent memorial as a lasting tribute to the victims \r\nof slavery and the transatlantic slave trade. CARICOM \r\nalso expresses its sincere appreciation to the Member \r\nStates, organizations and individuals that have made \r\ncontributions to the Trust Fund for the construction of \r\nthe memorial.\r\nCARICOM envisions that the memorial, The Ark of \r\nReturn, will speak volumes to hundreds of thousands \r\nof people in the years to come. It will encourage people \r\nof all races, colours, creeds and cultural and social \r\nstanding to respect each other as one people. In that \r\nregard, CARICOM calls on the Secretary-General to \r\ncontinue to take appropriate steps to enhance world \r\npublic awareness of the commemorative activities and \r\nthe permanent memorial at the Headquarters. We also \r\nrequest that the Department of Public Information \r\nof the Secretariat continue to take appropriate \r\nsteps to enhance world public awareness of the \r\ncommemorative activities and the permanent memorial \r\nat the Headquarters, in cooperation with the countries \r\nconcerned and the relevant organizations and bodies of \r\nthe United Nations system.\r\nCARICOM reiterates that the progress we have \r\nmade should not cause us to rest on any laurels. In fact, \r\nquite to the contrary, we should redouble our efforts \r\nand use all means at our disposal to combat racism \r\nand eliminate racial discrimination. The modern-\r\nday manifestations of slavery should be countered \r\nwith all our might. We who have come out victorious \r\nfrom the injustices and inequity of slavery should be \r\nat the vanguard of ensuring that this tragedy never \r\noccurs again.\r\nMrs. Rodríguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We thank the Secretary-General for the report \r\n(A/71/170) being discussed today.\r\nThe slave trade and the legacy of slavery are \r\nthe root causes of profound social and economic \r\ninequalities, hatred, fanaticism, racism and prejudice \r\nthat today continue to affect people of African descent. \r\nAt the World Conference against Racism, Racial \r\nDiscrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance, \r\nheld in Durban in 2001, which recognized that slavery \r\nand the transatlantic slave trade would qualify today \r\nas crimes against humanity, the historical leader of the \r\nCuban Revolution, Fidel Castro stated,\r\n“The inhuman exploitation imposed on the peoples \r\nof three continents, including Asia, marked forever \r\nthe destiny and lives of over 4.5 billion people \r\nliving in the Third World today, whose poverty, \r\nunemployment, illiteracy and health rates, as \r\nwell as their infant mortality, life expectancy and \r\nother calamities — too many, in fact, to enumerate \r\nhere — are certainly awesome and harrowing. \r\nThey are the current victims of that atrocity, \r\nwhich lasted centuries, and the ones who clearly \r\ndeserve compensation for the horrendous crimes \r\nperpetrated against their ancestors and peoples.”\r\nA remedy for, and full compensation to, the \r\npeoples and groups affected by a crime as horrific as it \r\nis imprescriptible is an inescapable moral duty. In that \r\nvein, Cuba supports the judicious request made earlier \r\non behalf of the States members of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity. Similarly, it would be fair to expect \r\nspecial and differentiated treatment for developing \r\ncountries, in particular in Africa, with respect to their \r\ninternational economic relations.\r\nDeveloped countries, along with their consumer \r\nsocieties, are responsible for the accelerated and nearly \r\nunstoppable destruction of the environment. They have \r\nbeen the main beneficiaries of conquest, colonization, \r\nslavery, the transatlantic slave trade and the heartless \r\nexploitation and extermination of hundreds of millions \r\nof descendants of peoples of the South. Those countries \r\nhave also been enriched by the unjust economic order \r\nimposed on humankind and the international financial \r\ninstitutions created exclusively for and by them as new \r\nforms of domination and subjugation.\r\nAs a result of that cruel brand of commerce, \r\napproximately 1.3 million Africans landed on our \r\nisland, most of whom came from the sub-Saharan \r\narea of the African continent. With their arrival, such \r\nAfrican ethnic groups as the Lucumi, Carabalí, Congo, \r\nGanga, Mina, Bibi and Yoruba, among others, had an \r\nimmediate impact on the colonial society of the time. \r\nFollowing a complex process of transculturation, the \r\nCuban nationality evolved into what is essentially \r\na mixture of Hispanic and African influences. My \r\ncountry is extremely proud of its African roots, which \r\naccount for our cultural uniqueness and characteristics. \r\n20/10/2016 A/71/PV.31\r\n16-33413 3/7\r\nIn the various periods of wars that led to the self-\r\ndetermination of the Cuban people, freed slaves and \r\ntheir descendants played a major role.\r\nDespite the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade against us, Cuba will maintain its cooperation \r\nprogrammes with African, Caribbean and Third \r\nWorld countries as part of the joint efforts aimed at \r\nreversing the consequences of the slave trade and the \r\nother shameful iterations of capitalism in its phases of \r\ncolonialism, neocolonialism and transnational financial \r\ndomination. Slavery and the transatlantic slave trade \r\nare among the most serious crimes perpetrated against \r\nhumankind that have not been properly addressed, and \r\ntheir consequences on society today have not been \r\nappropriately acknowledged.\r\nWe reaffirm the importance of further strengthening \r\nthe activities of the United Nations and other international \r\norganizations, such as UNESCO, in this area. That is \r\nthe least that the international community can do to \r\nremedy the crimes of slavery and the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade perpetrated against humankind.\r\nMr. Joshi (India): We thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his report (A/71/170) on the follow-up to the \r\ncommemoration of the two-hundredth anniversary of \r\nthe abolition of the transatlantic slave trade.\r\nThe transatlantic slave trade represents one of the \r\ndarkest phases in human history, when, several centuries \r\nago, forces of globalization began to shape the modern \r\nworld. The impacts of the slave trade continue to be \r\nfelt acutely even today. It is important to understand \r\nwhat the slave trade meant, so that we can draw lessons \r\nfrom our collective history and make sure that it cannot \r\nhappen again. It is equally important for the younger \r\nand future generations to carry that memory.\r\nAt its very basic level, the transatlantic slave trade \r\nwas the manifestation of naked greed and the immoral \r\npursuit of profit coupled with the unbridled abuse of \r\npower exercised over the weak. The sheer scale of this \r\ncrime against humanity is mind-boggling. It lasted \r\nfor four centuries, destroying lives and communities \r\nacross generations from vast regions of Africa, \r\nSouth America and the Caribbean — on both sides \r\nof the Atlantic. It fundamentally altered the societies, \r\neconomies and polities in those regions for centuries \r\nthereafter. Importantly, it helped achieve great wealth, \r\nprosperity and progress for some countries, yet it was \r\nbuilt upon unspeakable misery and destruction in \r\ndistant continents, as a frightening example of what \r\nungoverned and lawless globalization can lead to.\r\nWhile uprooted African communities have \r\ncontributed greatly to local economies, they have \r\nalso contributed immensely to and influenced the \r\narts, culture and life of societies where they now live. \r\nHowever, the deep wounds inflicted by the slave trade \r\ncontinue to fester today. Entire communities, including \r\nindigenous communities, continue to face the scars \r\nof deep-rooted racial discrimination, oppression and \r\nchronic poverty. The wounds are also reflected in the \r\nchronic underdeveloped and distorted economies that \r\nwere deliberately designed for the profit of the elite in \r\nthe faraway lands in a bygone era.\r\nIt is our collective responsibility to prevent the \r\nrecurrence of crimes and injustices such as those \r\nassociated with the slave trade. It is our duty to remember \r\nthe sacrifice that millions of people were forced to \r\nmake when they were uprooted from their homelands \r\nover generations to toil in miserable conditions for the \r\nprofit of others.\r\nIt was therefore satisfying to note that the efforts \r\nof the Caribbean Community, supported by African \r\nnations and others, finally led to the establishment of \r\nthe permanent memorial, The Ark of Return, last year at \r\nthe United Nations. India is proud to have joined as one \r\nof the lead contributors to United Nations Trust Fund \r\nfor Partnerships — Permanent Memorial.\r\nThe International Day of Remembrance of the \r\nVictims of Slavery and the Transatlantic Slave Trade, \r\nobserved on 25 March every year, honours the memory \r\nof the millions who suffered under that brutal system \r\nand helps raise awareness of the injustice and dangers of \r\nracism and prejudice. This year, to mark the Day, India \r\nand the Department of Public Information co-organized \r\nan exhibition on the history of enslaved East Africans \r\nwho were taken to India, many of whom rose to positions \r\nof military and political authority in our country. The \r\nexhibition brings out the comparatively greater social \r\nmobility experienced by those individuals in India. \r\nUNESCO has also played a key role in organizing and \r\nlinking programmes through the Slave Route project to \r\nspread understanding of the impact and consequences \r\nof the slave trade.\r\nFollowing the abolition of slavery, the colonial \r\nPowers turned to using millions of Indian indentured \r\nlabourers, at virtually no cost, to work on plantations \r\nacross the world in order to perpetuate their economic \r\nA/71/PV.31 20/10/2016\r\n4/7 16-33413\r\ndomination. The UNESCO project on the International \r\nIndentured Labour Route is another significant effort \r\nto preserve the memory and lessons of that era.\r\nWe must continue to raise awareness about the \r\nslave trade through education and outreach activities \r\nin order to promote a greater understanding of how our \r\ncomplex world has been shaped and what can be done \r\nto avoid repeating the injustices of the past.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): Today’s debate \r\noffers us an opportunity to pay tribute to the victims \r\nof one of the most heinous crimes committed against \r\nhumankind, but it also allows us to reflect on the \r\ncontinued relevance of the subject today. Liechtenstein \r\nis proud to have contributed to the creation of a \r\npermanent memorial, whose presence near the entrance \r\nof the General Assembly Building is a powerful \r\nreminder not only of the tragedy of the past, but also \r\nof the challenges that remain with regard to slavery in \r\nour day.\r\nOver a period of centuries, some 15 million men, \r\nwomen and children fell victim to the transatlantic slave \r\ntrade, one of the darkest chapters in human history. \r\nVictims were forcibly removed from their families and \r\nhomes and transferred overseas in the most appalling \r\nand inhumane conditions, resulting in innumerable \r\ndeaths. Those who survived were subjected to forced \r\nlabour and abuse and were permanently deprived of \r\nthe most basic human rights. The monument we have \r\nerected is a dignified and important reminder of these \r\nterrifying crimes against humanity. It must also serve \r\nas a reminder of our common commitment to ensuring \r\nthe absolute prohibition of slavery in all its forms. \r\nLooking at today’s reality, we have to admit that we are \r\nfar from reaching this goal.\r\nAn estimated 45 million people live in conditions \r\nthat qualify as modern slavery — more people than ever \r\nbefore. The scourge of slavery persists, even though its \r\nprohibition is a jus cogens norm in international law, \r\nindeed one of the most powerful of such norms. Despite \r\nthe fact that slavery is outlawed universally, human \r\ntrafficking and enslavement are crimes committed on a \r\nlarge scale and with widespread impunity. Today every \r\nsingle country is affected by modern slavery, which \r\ngenerates billions of dollars every year. Modern slavery \r\nand human trafficking do not simply constitute one of \r\nthe biggest human rights scandals of our time, but they \r\nare also one of the most lucrative business models for \r\norganized crime.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment in particular has generated fresh and \r\ndynamic momentum to address modern slavery in all \r\nof its aspects. Modern slavery and human trafficking \r\nare mentioned in 3 of the 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. The 2030 Agenda therefore gives us the platform \r\nto tackle the scourge, not merely as a law-enforcement \r\nissue but indeed in a much broader manner. \r\nGiven the complexity of the phenomenon, we all \r\nhave an opportunity to contribute to the achievement \r\nof our common goal to abolish modern slavery. \r\nLiechtenstein is currently focusing on two aspects in \r\nparticular. \r\nFirst, we are trying to address the business side \r\nof modern slavery. As it is one of the world’s most \r\nprofitable illegal business models, we can make use of \r\ntools that have proven effective in other areas — for \r\nexample, disrupting financial f lows and using relevant \r\ndata for criminal prosecutions: in short, following the \r\nmoney. We are planning to generate a set of concrete \r\nmeasures that will help enhance coordination among \r\nnational judiciaries and enable effective prosecutions.\r\nSecondly, we are working to address the enormous \r\nimpunity gap, with action at the international level. As \r\nnational judiciaries have systematically failed, there is a \r\nclear case for involving and making use of international \r\ncriminal justice, in particular the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC). The Rome Statute, the founding treaty of \r\nthe ICC, has jurisdiction over enslavement as both a \r\nwar crime and a crime against humanity. Given the \r\nuniversal nature of the phenomenon of modern slavery, \r\nthe Court can play a dual role by creating incentives for \r\nStates to investigate and prosecute at the national level \r\nand by investigating and prosecuting itself in cases \r\nwhere the impunity gap persists. Together with the \r\nCourt, we will continue to explore options to that end.\r\nHuman trafficking and modern slavery have been \r\non the United Nations agenda for years, but we have \r\nclearly not been effective in addressing the scourge. \r\nWe are grateful to see a new momentum from the \r\nmembership to do better and welcome the upcoming \r\nopportunities to do so. Key among them will be the open \r\ndebate in the Security Council in December as follow-\r\nup to the first-ever presidential statement adopted by \r\nthe Council on human trafficking in armed conflict, in \r\n2015 (S/PRST/2015/25). \r\nAs input for the discussion, we organized, together \r\nwith our partners from the United Nations University, \r\n20/10/2016 A/71/PV.31\r\n16-33413 5/7\r\nthe United Kingdom and civil society partners, a \r\nseminar that has produced a set of recommendations \r\nfor inclusion in the draft resolution that we believe \r\nthe Security Council should adopt in December. We \r\npresented a report to members in early September \r\nand hope that its recommendations, particularly those \r\nconcerning action, will be widely read and processed. \r\nWe welcome the leadership of the Council on the topic. \r\nAt the same time, the phenomena of human trafficking \r\nand modern slavery are of course not limited to times \r\nof armed conflict, which is why many of the report’s \r\nrecommendation can also be applied outside the context \r\nof the Council’s work.\r\nAnother important opportunity is the upcoming \r\nreview of the United Nations Global Plan of Action to \r\nCombat Trafficking in Persons, scheduled for October \r\n2017. We look forward to a well-managed process that \r\nwill allow us to explore new options for action that we \r\nmay have neglected in the past and to move forward \r\non the basis of consensus. The review year should also \r\nbe the moment for us to work towards the universal \r\nratification of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, especially Women and \r\nChildren, supplementing the United Nations Convention \r\nagainst Transnational Organized Crime, also known \r\nas the Palermo Convention. Next week, together with \r\nthe United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime and \r\nour partners from Austria, Slovenia and Switzerland, \r\nwe will organize a side event to that end as part of our \r\nactivities in the context of the women and peace and \r\nsecurity debate in the Security Council.\r\nModern slavery is a complex phenomenon that \r\naffects all of us and should leave none of us indifferent. \r\nAs individuals, policymakers and consumers, we all \r\nhave an opportunity to make a small contribution to \r\neradicate what is both a human tragedy and a large \r\nobstacle to sustainable development. We believe that \r\nsuch action is the best contribution that we can make to \r\ncommemorate this day in a meaningful way.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): Jamaica wishes to thank \r\nthe Secretary-General for his report (A/71/170) being \r\nconsidered today.\r\nWe also extend our gratitude to the United Nations \r\nOffice for Partnerships (UNOP), which over the years \r\nhas managed the Trust Fund established to support the \r\npermanent memorial. UNOP has operated at the highest \r\nlevels of professionalism and accountability, thereby \r\ndemonstrating once again that, as States Members \r\nof the United Nations, we can be justly proud of the \r\nhigh calibre of the staff serving our Organization. I \r\noffer special thanks to the Secretary-General and to \r\nthe Deputy Secretary-General, whose support for the \r\npermanent memorial initiative has been unwavering \r\nfrom the outset. Their support has not only been \r\nsymbolic, but has been manifested in specific ways that \r\ndirectly contributed to the success of the project. In fact, \r\nthe very selection of UNOP, as an entity specifically \r\ndesignated to support the implementation of the project, \r\nattests to the importance that was accorded to it by the \r\nSecretary-General.\r\nUNOP played a critical role throughout all stages \r\nof the project’s implementation and ensured that it \r\nremained on track and was completed on time and on \r\nbudget. In addition, it partnered with the Permanent \r\nMemorial Committee and with UNESCO to organize \r\nthe international competition that resulted in the \r\nselection of the winning design, The Ark of Return. The \r\nPermanent Memorial Committee benefited immensely \r\nfrom the professional support provided by UNOP, \r\nwhich acted as the custodian for the United Nations \r\nTrust Fund for Partnerships — Permanent Memorial, \r\nand I take this opportunity to place on record the \r\nCommittee’s sincere gratitude.\r\nAs demonstrated in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Member States provided the vast majority \r\nof the voluntary contributions used to undertake the \r\npermanent memorial initiative. We therefore owe an \r\nimmense debt of gratitude to all Member States for their \r\nconsistent support of the project. Our special thanks \r\ngo to the over 100 Member States — a wide range \r\nof developed and developing States, drawn from all \r\ngeographical regions, whether or not directly affected \r\nby the transatlantic slave trade — that made financial \r\ncontributions. That demonstrates the importance \r\nthat we have collectively attached to the permanent \r\nmemorial not just as a tangible symbol to honour the \r\nvictims and recognize those who struggled against the \r\nhorror of slavery, but also for the role the memorial \r\nplays as a reminder of the legacies of slavery and the \r\nneed for us to take action to address them.\r\nCivil society, the private sector and private \r\nindividuals also contributed meaningfully to the Fund. \r\nWe thank these partners for their commitment and \r\nsupport. Their inclusion among the list of contributors \r\ndemonstrates that the noble ideals surrounding the \r\nproject resonated with people across the world. It \r\nis indeed gratifying that the permanent memorial \r\nA/71/PV.31 20/10/2016\r\n6/7 16-33413\r\nrepresents part of the United Nations commitment to \r\none of its founding tenets, which is that our work here \r\nmust always be on behalf of “We the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations”.\r\nThe Ark of Return is already attracting numerous \r\nvisitors, including those who are participating in events \r\nand tours at the United Nations. We are confident \r\nthat its aesthetic appeal and universal message will \r\nendure and that all who visit it will feel the impact \r\nof its continuing message. We recall that its design \r\nis purposely sustainable, including its use of solar \r\nenergy for its lighting and the use of recycled water \r\nfor its tear drop and fountain features. We fully \r\nsupport the decision of the General Assembly that the \r\nbalance of funds in the Trust Fund should be retained \r\nby the United Nations to ensure the maintenance and \r\nupkeep of the memorial, and we take due note of the \r\ninformation provided in the Secretary-General’s report \r\nthat this is being undertaken. We look forward to the \r\npermanent memorial continuing to be a source of pride \r\nand inspiration to all its visitors over the years to come.\r\nMs. Mendelson (United States of America): In his \r\nmemoir, Twelve Years a Slave, Simon Northup, a free \r\nAmerican who had been enslaved in 1841, wrote,\r\n“In an hour, perhaps two, my heart leaped to \r\nmy throat, as the key rattled the door again. I, who \r\nhad been so lonely and who had longed so ardently \r\nto see someone, I cared not who, now shuddered at \r\nthe thought of man’s approach. A human face was \r\nfearful to me, especially a white one.”\r\nNorthup wrote these words after having become a victim \r\nof this transatlantic slave industry. He articulated the \r\nfear and the experience of one of millions of women, \r\ngirls, men and boys who lost their freedom, their \r\nlives, their families and their dignity as a result of the \r\ntransatlantic slave trade.\r\nThe United States recognizes slavery’s enduring \r\nimpact on the development of our country and that of \r\nother countries. Collectively, we must commit to always \r\nremembering slavery’s devastation, understanding \r\nits essence and striving to heal its enduring wounds. \r\nDescendants of slaves have made vital contributions \r\nto the United States. From the freed slaves who shared \r\ntheir stories to the leaders of the abolitionist movement \r\nwho propelled progress in the United States, to the \r\nearly educators and agitators against segregation and \r\nlynchings who paved the way for the modern civil rights \r\nmovement, to leaders in the arts, science and sports, \r\ndescendants of slaves have made the United States a \r\nstronger and better nation.\r\nDescendants of slaves have contributed to our \r\nability as a nation to both confront and acknowledge \r\ninjustice and to build a more inclusive and just society. \r\nThis year we made significant strides in our shared \r\nwork to promote remembrance of the victims of \r\nslavery. The down payment we have made towards a \r\npermanent memorial at the United Nations is a start. In \r\nWashington, D.C., the Smithsonian Institution opened \r\nits nineteenth museum, the National Museum of African \r\nAmerican History and Culture on 24 September 2016, \r\nensuring that the African American story, its roots and \r\nits successes are prominently featured in our nation’s \r\ncapital. As President Obama noted at the opening of \r\nthe museum,\r\n“the best history does not just sit behind a \r\nglass case; it helps us to understand what is outside \r\nthe case. The best history helps us recognize the \r\nmistakes that we have made and the dark corners \r\nof the human spirit that we need to guard against. \r\nAnd yes, a clear-eyed view of history can make \r\nus uncomfortable and shake us out of familiar \r\nnarratives. But it is precisely because of that \r\ndiscomfort that we learn and grow and harness our \r\ncollective power to make this nation more perfect.”\r\nAnother way that we memorialize victims of slavery \r\nis through our commitment to justice in the present. In \r\nour reflection on this day, we do no honour to the victims \r\nof the transatlantic slave trade if we fail to confront the \r\nmodern manifestation of slavery in the trafficking of \r\nwomen, men and children, which continues to plague \r\nthe world, with estimates of 20 to 40 million victims \r\nglobally. We can use commemorations such as this one \r\nand the International Decade for People of African \r\nDescent to deepen our awareness. We can pay respect to \r\nthose who did not make it through the Middle Passage \r\nand to the survivors of these tragic events through such \r\nart as The Ark of Return —-- a visible reminder of \r\nthe past and an inspiration for the future. And we can \r\ncommit to implementing the Sustainable Development \r\nGoal targets on eradicating human trafficking.\r\nAs we join together, let us also renew our \r\ncommitments to do even more to end discrimination \r\nand exploitation. The call for “never again” rings \r\ntrue today, and the evidence is clear: while we have \r\ncome a long way, we have much more to do to stop \r\nmodern slavery.\r\n20/10/2016 A/71/PV.31\r\n16-33413 7/7\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item. I thank Member States for their \r\nacknowledgment of the great significance of today’s \r\ncommemoration.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 119.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.50 a.m.\r\n"
