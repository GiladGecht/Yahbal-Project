"United Nations A/71/PV.32\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n32nd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 26 October 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 39\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/91)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.3)\r\nMr. Wafy (Niger): I have the honour to speak on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States on a matter of great \r\nimportance to the Group, and Africa in general, namely, \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba.\r\nFor more than two decades, this matter has been \r\nbrought before the General Assembly against the \r\nbackground of overwhelming yet unheeded appeals \r\nfor the immediate end to the long-standing economic \r\nembargo against Cuba. Today those appeals have taken \r\non a new dimension and more compelling justification, \r\ngiven the positive developments and progress made \r\nin relations between the Governments of Cuba and \r\nthe United States of America. The new dimension has \r\nbeen occasioned by the re-establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations, the historic visit by President Barack Obama \r\nto Cuba in March — apparently the first visit by an \r\nAmerican President to that country since 1928 — and \r\nthe resumption of commercial airline service between \r\nthe two countries in August.\r\nThe African Group calls for those ground-breaking \r\npositive steps to go further in lifting the economic \r\nembargo, which continues to inflict economic hardship \r\non the poor and innocent population of Cuba, and \r\nmost certainly makes the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment even more elusive, thereby undermining \r\nour collective efforts towards a universal push to \r\ndrive the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nAccordingly, the Group of African States reaffirms \r\nits full support for the General Assembly resolution \r\non the necessity of ending the economic, financial and \r\ncommercial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba. The Group of African States \r\nfurther reiterates the call made by the African Union \r\nAssembly of Heads of State and Government and the \r\noverwhelming call from States Members of the United \r\nNations, for the lifting of the long-standing and unjust \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade on Cuba.\r\nMr. Plasai (Thailand): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China on agenda \r\nitem 39, entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba”.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nhis comprehensive report (A/71/91) on the item we are \r\ndiscussing today.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China would like, first of \r\nall, to sincerely welcome the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the Government of Cuba \r\nand the Government of the United States of America. \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-34312 (E)\r\n*1634312*\r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n2/27 16-34312\r\nThe Group also welcomes steps taken towards the \r\nelimination of the United States embargo against Cuba, \r\nwhich include, among others, the reopening of their \r\nrespective embassies in 2015, President Obama’s visit to \r\nCuba in March and the amendments made in 2015 and \r\n2016 by the United States Department of the Treasury \r\nand the United States Department of Commerce.\r\nWhile those are positive steps, they remain \r\ninadequate to effectively end the impact of the embargo. \r\nMuch more remains to be done, especially action by \r\nthe United States Congress with regard to legislative \r\nbills proposing the lifting of blockade sanctions. The \r\nGroup also believes that the future President of the \r\nUnited States can and should exercise more of his \r\nor her executive powers to further modify blockade \r\nregulations in the light of the continued disinclination \r\non the part of the United States Congress to end those \r\npunitive measures, which are essentially in violation of \r\nthe purposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China would like to reiterate \r\nour commitment to the principles, purposes and spirit \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, in particular \r\nthe principles of the sovereign equality of States, \r\nnon-intervention and non-interference in their internal \r\naffairs, as well as the freedom of international trade \r\nand navigation. The Group believes that it is the duty \r\nand responsibility of every Member State to comply \r\nstrictly with those principles. The Group is of the \r\nview that any policy or action that disregards those \r\nprinciples — in this case the unilateral economic \r\nsanctions against Cuba — should be seriously considered \r\nfor immediate repeal. Given that the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba has continued for more than 50 \r\nyears, the Group of 77 and China would like to express \r\nits deep concern about the prolonged negative effects \r\nthat the economic sanctions and travel restrictions have \r\nhad on Cuba and its people.\r\nFrom April 2015 to April 2016, the impact of \r\nthe United States embargo on Cuba’s foreign trade \r\namounted to more than $4 billion. Limited foreign \r\ninvestment and difficult access to development \r\nassistance have translated directly into economic \r\nhardship and humanitarian impacts for the people of \r\nCuba. The country’s socioeconomic reforms have \r\nalso been hampered by the embargo. The Group of \r\n77 and China are concerned that, if those economic \r\nsanctions continue, Cuba’s development potential, in \r\nboth economic and human-development terms, will \r\nbe unfairly undermined, and it will be impossible for \r\nCuba to successfully embark upon the path towards \r\nsustainable development envisaged in the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, for which all Member \r\nStates have pledged support.\r\nOver many decades, Cuba has extensively and \r\ncontinuously contributed to the international community, \r\nparticularly through its remarkable provision of \r\nmedical assistance to countries in need. Cuba’s \r\nemergency assistance to the African countries affected \r\nby the Ebola crisis in West Africa is a great example \r\nof its solidarity with the international community. \r\nThe Group of 77 and China hereby commend Cuba’s \r\ncontributions in the form of humanitarian assistance \r\nand would like to express our hope that, if the United \r\nStates embargo were permanently lifted, Cuba would \r\nbe granted the opportunity that it has long deserved \r\nto fully cooperate with the global community and \r\ninternational organizations on health, the environment \r\nand agriculture, among other important issues.\r\nThe Group of 77 and China would like to reiterate \r\nour strong support for the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of resolution 70/5 and our call for an \r\nend to the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nby the United States against Cuba. The urgency and \r\nnecessity of our call is further highlighted by the \r\nongoing global and collective striving to implement the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The Group \r\nof 77 and China would therefore like to appeal to the \r\ninternational community to further step up efforts in \r\nsupport of the lifting of the embargo, not solely for the \r\nbenefit of Cuba, but also for the full achievement of the \r\neconomic and social development of all members of the \r\nglobal community as a whole.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): It a great privilege for \r\nme to address the General Assembly on behalf of \r\nthe 14 member States of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM).\r\nCARICOM aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of the Kingdom of Thailand on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China, and with the \r\nstatement to be delivered by the representative of the \r\nDominican Republic on behalf of Community of Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States.\r\nFor far too many years, the United States \r\nhas maintained a commercial embargo on Cuba, \r\nthrough various laws, regulations and presidential \r\nproclamations. That pernicious embargo has restricted \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 3/27\r\nthe ability of a proud, honourable, independent, \r\ntalented and self-reliant people to conduct legitimate \r\ntrade, travel and to undertake financial transactions. \r\nThe stated purpose of that all-encompassing economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade was to bring about \r\npolitical change. However, all these years later, we see \r\nthat the intended outcome has failed to materialize, \r\nand the sole result is the undue hardship that has \r\nbeen caused to the population of Cuba. We fully \r\nagree with President Obama’s characterization of the \r\nembargo as an outdated burden on the Cuban people, \r\nand we appreciate his acknowledgment that what the \r\nUnited States was doing was not working. Regrettably, \r\nhowever, his call upon his own Congress to lift the \r\nembargo has fallen on deaf ears.\r\nCARICOM, and virtually the entire international \r\ncommunity, has consistently highlighted the fact that \r\nthat unilateral, coercive and anachronistic measure \r\nis inconsistent with international law, transgresses \r\nfundamental humanitarian principles and contravenes \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the norms \r\ngoverning peaceful relations between States. In 2015, \r\nduring its landmark seventieth session, the General \r\nAssembly voted for the twenty-fourth consecutive year \r\non the necessity of ending the embargo against Cuba. \r\nThe near unanimous vote of 191 countries in favour of \r\nresolution 70/5 reflected an overwhelming attestation \r\nof the international community’s solidarity with the \r\npeople of Cuba.\r\nIt is for that reason that CARICOM welcomes the \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba, which was symbolized by \r\nPresident Obama’s historic visit to Havana in March \r\nand by the tangible action taken to reopen embassies \r\nin their respective countries. We applaud President \r\nObama’s recognition that the age-old blockade has \r\nbeen harmful to the Cuban people, and we salute his \r\nstated desire to bury the last remnant of the Cold War \r\nin the Americas.\r\nCARICOM and Cuba have had a long and fruitful \r\nrelationship, which predates the embargo. Cuba is an \r\nimportant development partner for the Caribbean, and \r\nour bonds of mutual respect, friendship and cooperation \r\nare deeply valued and treasured. We also enjoy friendly \r\nrelations with the United States and cooperate through \r\nvarious bilateral and regional initiatives. For that \r\nreason, we believe that improved relations between \r\nCuba and the United States of America can only bode \r\nwell for our nations. We therefore encourage both \r\ncountries to continue to explore ways to increase the \r\ntype of cooperation that was evident during the Ebola \r\ncrisis in West Africa. The renewal of relations between \r\nthose two neighbours signals a new era of engagement \r\nfor both countries. CARICOM sees those developments \r\nas important first steps in our hemisphere’s journey \r\ntowards a destination that is enveloped in an \r\nenvironment of lasting peace and security, one where \r\ndevelopment can f lourish.\r\nCARICOM will once again unreservedly support \r\nthe draft resolution on the necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. It is our \r\nhope that this will be the final time that the Assembly \r\nwill have to consider this agenda item. Indeed, we \r\nlook forward to that becoming a reality in the very \r\nnear future.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): I have the honour \r\nto address the General Assembly on behalf of the \r\n10 member States of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN) to express our support for \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.3, on ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against the Republic of Cuba.\r\nThe General Assembly has consistently adopted this \r\nannual draft resolution by an overwhelming majority \r\nsince it was first introduced, in 1992. ASEAN member \r\nStates have voted unanimously in favour of the draft \r\nresolution for the past 15 years. In 2015, a spokesperson \r\nfor ASEAN made a statement in the General Assembly \r\ncalling for the unilateral embargo against Cuba to be \r\nlifted as soon as possible (see A/70/PV.40). It is our \r\nfirm belief that differences between States should be \r\nsettled through engagement, not confrontation, and by \r\ninclusion, not isolation. All of that must be done while \r\nbearing in mind the fundamental principles of sovereign \r\nequality, non-interference and non-intervention, as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nASEAN welcomes the restoration of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica. President Barack Obama’s state visit in March, \r\nthe relaxation of travel restrictions to Cuba for United \r\nStates citizens and the restoration of direct f lights \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba are important \r\nsteps towards the normalization of bilateral relations. \r\nThey are key to building better regional relations in \r\nthe Americas. In ASEAN’s view, a more important \r\nstep will be for the United States to end its economic, \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n4/27 16-34312\r\ncommercial and financial embargo on Cuba. It would \r\nsignificantly improve the quality of life and living \r\nstandards of the Cuban people and contribute to the \r\neconomic and social development of Cuba. Bringing an \r\nend to the embargo would also advance the Assembly’s \r\nefforts towards achieving an inclusive 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nASEAN encourages the United States and Cuba in \r\ntheir efforts to chart a new way forward. We recognize \r\nthat much remains to be done. ASEAN joins the other \r\nmembers of the Assembly in reiterating our support for \r\nthe lifting of the unilateral embargo against Cuba as \r\nsoon as possible.\r\nMr. Kononuchenko (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We would like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor having drafted the report (A/71/91) on the need to \r\nend the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba that was imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica. The position of the Russian Federation in that \r\nrespect remains unchanged.\r\nThe embargo of the United States of America \r\ntargeting Cuba must be immediately lifted, as it directly \r\ncontradicts the fundamental principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations regarding the inadmissability of \r\nany measures of discrimination and intervention in the \r\ndomestic affairs of sovereign States. The experience of \r\nCuba does a good job of showing the short-sightedness \r\nand counterproductivity of the imposition of unilateral \r\neconomic, commercial and financial coercive measures \r\nfor the attainment of political objectives. Above all, \r\nthey burden ordinary citizens. They worsen the plight \r\nof those most vulnerable. The outcome of the vote on \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.3, on the necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commerical and financial blockade, will \r\nagain reveal the growing international awareness of the \r\ninadmissability of allowing such a state of affairs to \r\npersist. \r\nThe persistent American sanctions against Cuba \r\nare a relic of the past. From the outset, they placed Cuba \r\nin a vulnerable position regarding the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The \r\nsanctions constrain and at times directly undermine \r\nthe capacity of that island State to mobilize resources \r\nfor the attainment of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. In that connection, the international community, \r\nhaving unanimously assumed the obligation to leave no \r\none behind, does not have the moral right to continue to \r\ntolerate sanctions against Cuba.\r\nOn 19 October the State Duma of the Russian \r\nFederation made its annual declaration to the General \r\nAssembly and the Parliaments of Member States \r\ncondemning the policy of Washington, which for more \r\nthan 50 years has been opportunistically imposing the \r\nmost protracted unilateral sanctions in the history of \r\ninternational relations. The Russian deputies extended \r\ntheir solidarity to the Cuban people, who are upholding \r\ntheir freedom and sovereignty despite limitations and \r\nrestrictions of a humanitarian nature imposed on them.\r\nThe United States’ relaxation of the embargo \r\ndoes not lift the embargo, as such. The failure to lift \r\nthe embargo is, however, at odds with the approach \r\nof seeking to normalize Cuban-American relations. \r\nCubans continue to face serious obstacles as they \r\nstrive to fully engage in the international financial and \r\neconomic system. That undermines the entire range of \r\nglobal integration links and undermines regional and \r\ninternational cooperation. We hope that Washington, \r\nD.C., will finally acknowledge the imperatives of \r\nthe present-day realities and that the process of \r\nstrengthening links with Havana — especially with \r\nregard to the embargo — will be furthered and receive \r\nthe necessary momentum, regardless of the political \r\nsituation and the results of the elections in the United \r\nStates.\r\nThe Russian Federation would like to affirm \r\nits determination to cooperate in ensuring a fair and \r\nequitable international order founded on the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. We \r\nfirmly believe that the key to solving the problem lies in \r\nthe countries’ goodwill and readiness to seek mutually \r\nacceptable compromises, rather than in using coercion \r\nand blackmail. The principles of integrity, sovereignty, \r\nnon-interference in States’ internal affairs, and \r\ncooperation do not permit the use of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures, which are in violation of international law. \r\nIn that connection, we deplore the continuing United \r\nStates sanctions on Cuba and urge all countries to join \r\nus at this seventy-first session of the General Assembly \r\nin voting in favour of draft resolution A/71/L.3, on \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against \r\nCuba.\r\nThe President: I would like to propose that the list \r\nof speakers on the current topic be closed, in view of \r\nthe large number of delegations inscribed on the list.\r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 5/27\r\nUnless I see any objection, I will take it that the \r\nAssembly agrees to close the list of speakers.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nMr. Cortorreal (Dominican Republic) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I have the honour to speak on behalf of the \r\nCommunity of Latin American and Caribbean States \r\n(CELAC).\r\nCELAC welcomes the progress in the process of \r\nnormalizing diplomatic relations between Cuba and the \r\nUnited States of America, which marks the beginning \r\nof a new chapter in the history of peace and coexistence \r\namong the nations of the Americas. We acknowledge \r\nPresident Obama’s wish to end the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo that the United \r\nStates has imposed on Cuba for more than 50 years. \r\nHowever, we regret the fact that the blockade is still a \r\nreality for the Cuban people. It presents an undeniably \r\nmajor obstacle to Cuba’s normal development. The \r\nSecretary-General’s report (A/71/91) confirms how \r\nmuch the policy has cost Cuba and the substantial and \r\nunjustifiable harm that it does to the Cuban people’s \r\nwell-being. It is antithetical to the Latin American \r\npeoples’ desire for peace, as enshrined in the 2014 \r\nHavana Declaration of the Latin American and the \r\nCaribbean region as a zone of peace. Moreover, the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade imposed \r\non Cuba is contrary to the letter and spirit and the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and of international law.\r\nCELAC reiterates its firm rejection of any \r\napplication of laws and measures, such as the Helms-\r\nBurton Act, that run counter to international law, \r\nespecially those with extraterritorial effects, as well as \r\nthe increasing harassment of Cuba in its international \r\nfinancial transactions, in opposition to the political \r\nwill of the international community in general. We \r\nurge the Government of the United States of America \r\nto stop implementing its current policy on the matter. \r\nThe United States Congress has the authority to end the \r\nCuban embargo completely. However, we acknowledge \r\nthe executive actions that President Obama has \r\nundertaken since January of last year, including \r\nremoving Cuba from the list of countries sponsoring \r\nterrorism — which Cuba should never have been on in \r\nthe first place — which illustrate the broad capacity \r\nthat the United States President has to modify its unjust \r\npolicy of embargo.\r\nCELAC would like to recall its special declaration \r\non the need to put an end the economic, commercial \r\nand financial blockade imposed by the United States \r\nagainst Cuba, adopted at its fourth Summit, held in \r\nQuito on 26 and 27 January, in which we requested\r\n“the Government of the United States of America \r\nto fulfil the successive resolutions adopted by the \r\nUnited Nations General Assembly and, in response \r\nto the repeated calls from the international \r\ncommunity, to put an end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade against Cuba, \r\nwhich runs contrary to international law and \r\nseverely and unjustifiably damages the well-being \r\nof the Cuban people.”\r\nThe United Nations Charter enshrines rights, \r\nobligations and principles that have become part of \r\nthe legal heritage, not just of international law but of \r\nhumankind in general. They should not be violated or \r\nabused by any Member State, which should ensure that \r\ntheir national and international actions are in accord \r\nwith the rights, obligations and principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter.\r\nIn 2015 the resolution on this topic (resolution 70/5) \r\nwas adopted with 191 votes in favour, in affirmation of \r\nthe universality of its cause. For those reasons, CELAC \r\nwill once again give its firm support to this year’s draft \r\nresolution entitled “Necessity of ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba” (A/71/L.3). \r\nWe emphasize the inconsistency of unilateral measures \r\nthat are not supported by international law or by the \r\nletter, the spirit and the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter. We reiterate our call to the United States of \r\nAmerica to accede to the countries of Latin America \r\nand the Caribbean and of every region of the world, and \r\nto harken to the views of its own people, as they urge \r\nit to put an end once and for all to the unjust embargo \r\nof Cuba.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait): I have the honour to make \r\nthis statement on behalf of the member States of the \r\nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC).\r\nAt the outset, the member States of the OIC welcome \r\nthe restoration of diplomatic ties between the United \r\nStates and Cuba, the reopening of their embassies \r\nmore than a year ago and President Barack Obama’s \r\nvisit to Cuba in March, as well as the other significant \r\nsteps that have been taken between the two countries’ \r\nGovernments. The OIC emphasizes the importance that \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n6/27 16-34312\r\nthose steps will have for efforts to normalize bilateral \r\nties between both nations, and stresses that improving \r\nrelations and moving forward positively would be \r\nmutually beneficial for both peoples.\r\nIn spite of those positive steps, however, there \r\nremains the issue of the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States on \r\nCuba years ago. That unilateral action by the United \r\nStates has harmed not only the Cuban economy \r\nbut also the well-being of the Cuban people and of \r\nCuban nationals living in other countries, creating \r\nunnecessary economic hardship for them. Furthermore, \r\nthe decades-long embargo has impeded socioeconomic \r\nand development progress, and it will obstruct Cuba’s \r\nefforts to achieve sustainable development as long as \r\nit continues. In addition, the unilateral blockade also \r\naffects third countries, as well as entities and companies \r\nthat face fines for conducting commercial activity with \r\nCuba.\r\nThe OIC believes that such unilateral action runs \r\ncounter to the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. The OIC reiterates its deep concern \r\nabout the negative impact that the unilateral blockade \r\nhas on the Cuban people and considers its continuation \r\nunjustifiable. \r\nThe OIC supports this year’s draft resolution on \r\nthis agenda item (A/71/L.3) and calls on the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations to vote in favour of \r\nit.The OIC believes that, given the support behind the \r\ndraft resolution, entitled the “Necessity of ending the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba”, it truly \r\nreflects the international community’s collective view \r\non this topic.\r\nMr. Ramírez Carreño (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): As the current Chair \r\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, I have \r\nthe honour to address the General Assembly on behalf \r\nof the 120 States Members of the United Nations that \r\ncomprise this mechanism for consultation and joint \r\npolitical action.\r\nI begin by extending a warm welcome and \r\nrevolutionary salute to the Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Cuba, Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla.\r\nTwnety-five times the General Assembly has \r\nexpressed its overwhelming support for and solidarity \r\nwith the Government and the people of Cuba with \r\ndecisive votes in favour of the draft resolution calling \r\non the United States to lift the embargo against this \r\nfraternal Latin American and Carribean country.. We \r\nthank the Secretary-General for the presentation of his \r\nreport (A/71/91) on this important issue. Last year, 191 \r\nMember States voted in favour of resolution 70/5. \r\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries has \r\nalways reiterated its strongest opposition to unilateral \r\ncoercive measures with extraterritorial effects because \r\nthey are illegal. The Non-Aligned Movement has \r\nrepeatedly called on the Government of the United States \r\nof America to put an end to its economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo against Cuba, which is contrary \r\nto international law, the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand the norms and principles governing peaceful \r\nrelations among States. It also violates Cuba’s right to \r\ninteract freely with the international community.\r\nThe embargo has had adverse impacts on the well-\r\nbeing of the people of Cuba in violating their human \r\nrights. The direct and indirect damage inflicted by the \r\nunjustified embargo against Cuba is enormous. That \r\nillegal policy affects all sectors that are crucial to the \r\nCuban economy, such as public health, nutrition and \r\nagriculture, as well as banking, trade, investment and \r\ntourism. The blockade denies Cuba access to markets \r\nand to development aid from international financial \r\ninstitutions, as well as technology transfers. It creates \r\nimpediments to the socioeconomic development of \r\nthe country. The embargo is also the main obstacle to \r\nbroader access to the Internet, the exchange of ideas \r\nand the development of cultural, sport and scientific \r\nrelations. The continuation of the embargo is totally \r\nunjustifiable and undermines Cuba’s efforts to achieve \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe economic damage to the Cuban people by the \r\nimposition of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo by the United States of America against Cuba \r\namounts to $833.7 billion, if one takes into account the \r\ndepreciation of the dollar with respect to the price of \r\ngold on the international market. During all these years, \r\nthe blockade has caused damage of over $121 billion, \r\nusing current prices.\r\nThe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries considers \r\nthe establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States to be an initial positive step in \r\nthe process towards the normalization of bilateral \r\nrelations. At the same time, it should be noted that the \r\nblockade has remained unchanged. Indeed, under the \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 7/27\r\ncurrent Administration, the blockade has been further \r\ntightened, and its territorial application has been \r\nintensified through the imposition of 42 fines on entities, \r\nboth foreign and American, amounting to $13.2 billion. \r\nWhile the regulations issued by the Departments of \r\nCommerce and the Treasury on 15 January 2015 were \r\nsteps in the right direction in areas such as travel to \r\nCuba, telecommunication and remittances, they are \r\nlimited in scope and only modify some aspects related \r\nto the implementation of the blockade.\r\nDespite the historic decision of the United States \r\nPresident to notify the Congress of his decision to \r\nremove Cuba from the so-called list of State sponsors \r\nof international terrorism — a list on which Cuba \r\nshould never have been included — that has not meant \r\nan easing of the intricacies of all the prohibitions \r\nand restrictions established by the blockade laws and \r\nregulations imposed against this fraternal country.\r\nGiven what I have just said, the Movement of \r\nNon-Aligned Countries maintains its call for an end \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba. That was \r\nreiterated during the seventeenth Summit of the Heads \r\nof State and Government, held on Margarita Island \r\nin the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela on 17 and \r\n18 September. The vote in the General Assembly last \r\nyear in favour of resolution 70/5 by 191 Member \r\nStates constituted an expression of unanimity within \r\nthe international community in demanding the end of \r\nthe 50-year embargo and adherence to the principles \r\nof mutual respect and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of Cuba.\r\nCurrently, over 190 nations have economic and \r\npolitical relations with Cuba, while the United States \r\nremains alone in pursuing its unjustified policy of \r\neconomic sanctions. The Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries once again urges the United States of America \r\nto yield to the will of the overwhelming majority of \r\nthe international community and to rectify its failed \r\npolicies by fully complying with the General Assembly \r\nresolutions calling for an immediate and complete end \r\nto the embargo imposed on Cuba.\r\nFinally, the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries \r\nreiterates that full respect for the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations is an essential \r\nelement in the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity and that the international community should \r\ncontinue working to eliminate unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures, as they are illegal, such as the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo imposed by the \r\nUnited States of America against Cuba.\r\nNow, in my national capacity, I wish to say that the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela will vote in favour of \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.3, for we are convinced that the \r\nnew statement by the General Assembly rejecting the \r\nblockade imposed by the United States against Cuba \r\nreflects our firm position with regard to unrestricted \r\nrespect for the purposes and principles that sustain the \r\ninternational legal and political order in support of the \r\nmaintenance of harmonious and stable relations among \r\nthe Member States of this Organization.\r\nThe blockade imposed on the brotherly people \r\nof Cuba for 56 years has shown itself today to be a \r\ntotal failure. Its only objective has been the supposed \r\ndesire to restrict the right to self-determination of that \r\ncountry and to defeat the Cuban revolution. Despite the \r\nobstacles created by that unilateral measure, Cuba has \r\nbeen able to deal with the illegal action, maintaining \r\nits sovereignty and political independence with dignity \r\nunder the banners of international law and the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nWe wish to point out that the American policy of \r\nsanctions has been wrong and has drawn attention to \r\nthe extraordinary capacity and political determination \r\nof the Cuban people and the intrinsic moral force of the \r\nheirs of the legacy of José Martí. \r\nTherefore, in contrast to the destabilizing purposes \r\nand plans of the supporters of that illegal policy, Cuba \r\nhas been characterized throughout its revolutionary \r\nhistory, under the leadership of Commander Fidel \r\nCastro and the current President, Mr. Raúl Castro, by \r\nits spirit of solidarity with the sister countries of the \r\ndeveloping world, providing, despite its economic \r\ndifficulties, unbiased help and solidarity to peoples with \r\nhumanitarian needs arising from natural disasters or \r\nepidemics like Ebola and cholera. It deploys specialized \r\nmedical personnel to help victims of those diseases in \r\nany corner of the globe.\r\nVenezuela therefore once again urges the \r\nGovernment of the United States to put an immediate \r\nend to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade against this Latin American and Caribbean \r\nsister country and to make that happen in harmony with \r\nthe process of the normalization of bilateral relations \r\nbetween the two countries. \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n8/27 16-34312\r\nThe defeat of the blockade is a moral and political \r\nvictory for the people of the Cuban revolution against \r\nthe largest empire on Earth. Long live Cuba! Long live \r\nChavez! Long live Fidel! Venceremos!\r\nMr. Sandoval Mendiolea (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation associates itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the Dominican \r\nRepublic on behalf of the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States.\r\nAs in previous years, Mexico once again reiterates \r\nits rejection of the unilateral action against the Republic \r\nof Cuba, including the imposition for more than five \r\ndecades of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade, which runs counter to international law and \r\nthe relations of friendship and cooperation that must \r\nprevail among States.\r\nOnly a month ago, the President of Mexico, \r\nMr. Enrique Peña Nieto, reiterated before the General \r\nAssembly (see A/71/PV.10) my country’s call for the \r\nlifting of the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade against Cuba, which will produce a climate \r\nof detente and understanding in our region. The \r\nGovernment of Mexico today reaffirms that call \r\nand confirms that it will support the draft resolution \r\nbefore the Assembly (A/71/L.3), as it invariably has in \r\nprevious years.\r\nMexico welcomes the progress in the process of \r\nnormalization of the relations between Cuba and the \r\nUnited States of America, two important neighbours \r\nand partners for my country, but it is aware that full \r\nnormalization requires eliminating the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade against Cuba. My \r\ncountry recognizes the measures that the President of \r\nthe United States has implemented to ease the blockade, \r\nbut it knows that lifting the blockade is within the \r\npurview of the United States Congress.\r\nThe Republic of Cuba is undertaking efforts to \r\nupdate its economic and social model. The elimination \r\nof the embargo would facilitate the restructuring of the \r\nCuban economy and allow its full reintegration and \r\naccess to international trade f lows and investment. \r\nMexico recognizes the actions taken by the Government \r\nof the Republic of Cuba to fulfil its international \r\ncommitments in the field of development. Despite the \r\nadverse circumstances that it has confronted for more \r\nthan 50 years, Cuba has high human development \r\nindices in the areas of labour, health, education and \r\nthe environment, among others, as recently recognized \r\nin the United Nations Development Programme’s \r\n2016 Regional Human Development Report for Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean. With an end to the \r\nblockade, Cuba will be able to implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and fully achieve \r\nits 17 Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nMy country supports the process of updating \r\nthe Cuban economic and social model and intends to \r\ncontribute to that process, if so requested.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nassociates itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Thailand on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China.\r\nA year ago, the United Nations development summit \r\nadopted the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich launched new prospects for international \r\ncooperation for development. The comprehensive \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda is, and will be \r\nfor some time to come, the central task in the field \r\nof development.\r\nCountries should work on the basis of equality, \r\nengage in cooperation guided by an open and inclusive \r\napproach and seek common development through \r\nwin-win cooperation with a view to sharing the fruits \r\nof development. Such circumstances call for putting an \r\nimmediate end to the economic embargo and sanctions \r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba.\r\nThe General Assembly has for 24 consecutive years \r\nadopted by an overwhelming majority a resolution on \r\nthe necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba, and urging all States to comply \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations and the norms of \r\ninternational law, and rescind or abolish measures that \r\nhave extraterritorial effects affecting the sovereignty \r\nof other States, the legitimate interests of entities or \r\npersons under their jurisdiction and the freedom of \r\ntrade and navigation. \r\nIt is regrettable that for so many years none of \r\nthose resolutions have been implemented, and the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States against Cuba still remains in \r\neffect. Such violations of the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and the relevant \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions have caused enormous \r\neconomic and financial losses for Cuba and impeded \r\nthe efforts of the Cuban people to eradicate poverty and \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 9/27\r\npromote sustainable economic and social development. \r\nIt has not only undermined the Cuban people’s right \r\nto life and development, but has also affected the \r\nnormal economic, commercial and financial exchanges \r\nbetween other countries and Cuba.\r\nChina has always stood for respect for the right \r\nof countries to freely choose their social systems and \r\ntheir path towards development. It opposes unilateral \r\nsanctions against other countries by military, political, \r\neconomic or any other means. China has always strictly \r\ncomplied with and implemented the relevant General \r\nAssembly resolutions. China and Cuba have maintained \r\neconomic, commercial and personal exchanges, and a \r\nfriendly and mutually beneficial cooperation in various \r\nareas between our two countries has been steadily \r\ndeveloping. Not long ago, Premier Li Keqiang visited \r\nCuba, at which time the leaders of our two countries \r\nreached a broad common understanding on the further \r\ndeepening of the pragmatic cooperation between \r\nChina and Cuba in line with the aspirations of our two \r\npeoples and in the interest of the economic and social \r\ndevelopment of Cuba.\r\nIn our times, characterized by multipolarization, \r\neconomic globalization, cultural diversity and the \r\ndemocratization of international relations, the general \r\ntrend is towards exchange and cooperation among \r\ncountries on an equal footing. Dialogue among equals \r\nand amicable consultations represent the best way to \r\nresolve differences.\r\nMr. Zamora Rivas (El Salvador), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nChina has taken note of the measures taken by the \r\nUnited States to ease the constraints it has imposed on \r\nCuba with regard to commerce, trade and tourism, and \r\nwe hope that the United States and Cuba will continue \r\nto work towards the normalization of their relations. We \r\nhope that the United States will fully repeal its embargo \r\npolicy against Cuba at an early date and develop normal \r\nState-to-State relations with it, in accordance with the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the basic norms governing international \r\nrelations. That is in the common interest of both \r\ncountries and their peoples and in the interest of the \r\npeace and stability of the Americas and the common \r\ndevelopment of the international community.\r\nChina will once again vote in favour of the draft \r\nresolution, A/71/L.3, submitted by Cuba.\r\nMrs. Nguyen (Viet Nam): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to extend my warmest welcome to Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba.\r\nViet Nam aligns itself with the statements delivered \r\nby the representatives of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the Secretary-General’s \r\ncomprehensive report (A/71/91), which lays out the \r\npositions of Member States on ending the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba and \r\nassessments by United Nations agencies of the impact \r\nof the blockade.\r\nOn 27 October 2015, Viet Nam joined with 190 other \r\ndelegations in voting in favour of resolution 70/5. The \r\nadoption of that resolution by an overwhelming majority \r\nonce again sent a strong message from the international \r\ncommunity calling on the United States of America \r\nto end its embargo against Cuba. It is our principled \r\nposition that Viet Nam opposes the imposition of any \r\nunilateral embargo and coercive measures by one State \r\non another. \r\nToday Viet Nam will vote unreservedly in favour \r\nof draft resolution A/71/L.3 in its entirety. By its vote \r\nViet Nam wishes to reiterate its firm belief that the \r\nUnited States blockade against Cuba, which has lasted \r\nfor more than five decades, is contrary to international \r\nlaw and the fundamental principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and has caused untold hardship \r\nto the Cuban people. That policy runs counter to \r\nthe common intentions of all nations in the world to \r\nbuild international relations on a sound and equitable \r\nbasis, regardless of their political systems and with \r\nrespect for each nation’s right to choose its own path \r\nof development.\r\nViet Nam welcomes the restoration of full \r\ndiplomatic ties between Cuba and the United States \r\nand the outcomes of President Barack Obama’s visit to \r\nCuba in March. We also welcome the latest decision by \r\nthe United States President to issue his policy directive \r\non Cuba on 14 October and to announce a group of \r\nmeasures to modify the application of some aspects of \r\nthe embargo. We hope that such progressive steps will \r\ncreate a political dynamic that will eventually lead to \r\nthe repeal of the blockade, which poses an essential \r\nobstacle to the normalization of relations between the \r\ntwo countries.\r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n10/27 16-34312\r\nOnce again, Viet Nam joins with other delegations \r\nto call on the United States to put an immediate end \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial blockade \r\nagainst Cuba. The lifting of the embargo would meet \r\nthe aspirations of both the American and the Cuban \r\npeoples. It would be beneficial both for the people of \r\nthe region and for peace, stability and prosperity in the \r\nregion and the world.\r\nMy delegation wishes to take this opportunity \r\nto reiterate Viet Nam’s friendship, cooperation and \r\nsolidarity with Cuba. We will continue to do our utmost \r\nto help the people of Cuba to overcome the difficulties \r\nand challenges imposed by the embargo.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): At the outset, Bolivia welcomes \r\nthe presence among us of Comrade Bruno Rodríguez \r\nParrilla, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba.\r\nOnce again, Bolivia joins the concert of the \r\nnations of the world to condemn and repudiate, most \r\nenergetically, the unilateral, immoral, unjust, illegal, \r\nanachronistic and criminal economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against \r\nCuba for more than half a century.\r\nI will take advantage of these few minutes to pay \r\ntribute to the Cuban people and its revolution. I am \r\nconvinced that the best way of doing so is to pay tribute \r\nto the person who, as the Argentine writer Julio Cortázar \r\nsaid, was the sculptor of the revolution. I am thinking \r\nhere about Fidel Castro Ruz, who, as the world knows, \r\nrecently celebrated his ninetieth birthday. He resisted \r\nthroughout the terms of 11 American Presidents, and \r\nhe won. He has survived more than 600 attacks against \r\nhis life organized by the empire. Never in the history of \r\nhumankind have there been so many plans and so many \r\nresources devoted to ending the life of a single person. \r\nFidel has a special place — a privileged place — in the \r\nhearts and in the history of the liberation of peoples. He \r\nhas shaped the most solidary-replete revolution in the \r\nhistory of humankind and has brought us closer to the \r\nutopia of a better world.\r\nCuba’s people, our people, have witnessed the \r\nmarvellous solidarity of the Cuban revolution. My \r\nbrothers and sisters from Africa know what I am \r\ntalking about. Cuba is the only non-African country \r\nthat fought against the regime of apartheid. Another \r\ntitan of history, Nelson Mandela, said the following,\r\n“I am a loyal man, and I will never forget that, in \r\nthe darkest moments of our country in the fight \r\nagainst apartheid, Fidel Castro was on our side.”\r\nOur brothers and sisters of Asia and Pacific also \r\nknow the Cubans, because Cuba has been in the front \r\nlines helping victims of earthquakes and typhoons in \r\ndistant regions. Ho Chi Minh, the great Vietnamese \r\nleader, said that Cubans, with Fidel as their leader, were \r\nin solidarity with his people and their struggle, and that \r\nthe Vietnamese would never forget that support. In \r\nmy own region, in Latin America and the Caribbean, \r\ncountless lives have been saved by Cuban doctors. \r\nCountless people know how to read and write thanks to \r\nteachers from Cuba. Our President Morales Ayma has \r\nnoted that the Cubans shared the little that they had, \r\nand they did so in a disinterested way; they never asked \r\nanything from anyone — no mining, oil or forestry \r\nresources — for their solidarity.\r\nFrom this rostrum Fidel not only encouraged \r\nhumankind, but he led the fight against arms, against \r\nnuclear weapons, against debt, against the pillaging \r\nof our natural resources, against the anti-democratic \r\nfinancial and monetary system, against climate change \r\nand against hunger, disease and inequality — in \r\nsummary, against capitalism and imperialism and for \r\nthe building of a new international order.\r\nToday we are not only voting against the blockade; \r\nwe are voting for hope and for the marvellous possibility \r\nof making a better world. Cuba is the example to be \r\nfollowed, and Fidel is the symbol of the dignity of \r\nour peoples.\r\nI wish to apologize to you, sir,, but when one is full \r\nof gratitude in one’s heart, the last thing one is thinking \r\nabout is protocol. That is why I wish to conclude by \r\nsaying, “Long live Fidel! Long live Cuba!”\r\nMr. Lal (India): India associates itself with the \r\nstatement by the representative of Thailand on behalf \r\nof the Group of 77 and China and the statement by the \r\nrepresentative of Venezuela on behalf of the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nWe welcome the Foreign Minister of Cuba among \r\nus here today.\r\nIndia welcomes the restoration of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica, the historic visit of the President of the United \r\nStates to Cuba in March and the further developments \r\nin that regard since then.\r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 11/27\r\nFor more than two decades now, the General \r\nAssembly has considered annually the issue of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States against Cuba. It has consistently \r\nrejected the imposition of laws and regulations with \r\nextraterritorial impact and all other forms of coercive \r\neconomic measures that hurt the progress and \r\nprosperity of people the world over. The Assembly has \r\nalso called upon all States, in conformity with their \r\nobligations under the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law, to refrain from promulgating and \r\napplying laws and measures that have extraterritorial \r\neffects affecting the sovereignty of other States, as well \r\nas to repeal and invalidate any such laws. There can be \r\nlittle doubt that the continued existence of the embargo \r\nagainst Cuba, in contravention of world opinion as \r\nexpressed by the Assembly, undermines multilateralism \r\nand the credibility of the United Nations itself.\r\nAs the world’s largest democracy, with an abiding \r\nfaith in multilateralism, India stands in solidarity \r\nwith the international community in its unambiguous \r\nrejection of domestic laws having extraterritorial \r\nimpact. Embargoes impede the full achievement of \r\neconomic and social development by the population of \r\nthe affected country, in particular where children and \r\nwomen are concerned. They also hinder the overall \r\nenjoyment of human rights, including the right to \r\ndevelopment, food, medical care and social services, \r\namong other things.\r\nSuccessive reports of the Secretary-General have \r\nestablished — and this year’s report (A/71/91) is no \r\nexception — that the embargo, particularly through \r\nits extraterritorial effects, has adversely affected \r\nthe Cuban people and the development efforts of the \r\ncountry. At the same time, we would like to acknowledge \r\nthe notable socioeconomic and developmental \r\nachievements of the Cuban people, in particular the \r\nhigh Human Development Index ranking of Cuba and its \r\nachievement of several of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. The continued embargo would severely impact \r\nCuba’s ability to implement the comprehensive 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nCuba’s expertise in health care, achieved despite \r\nthe conditions imposed by the embargo, enabled it to \r\nrespond quickly, effectively and in a substantial manner \r\nto the call made by the General Assembly two years ago \r\nto all nations to respond to the Ebola crisis in Africa.\r\nIn launching the transformative 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, world leaders again strongly \r\nurged all States to refrain from unilateral economic, \r\nfinancial or trade measures not in accordance with \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nThe international community needs to redouble its \r\nefforts to promote an environment free from sanctions \r\nand embargoes.\r\nIndia hopes that the ongoing positive developments \r\nin the relations between Cuba and the United States will \r\nlead to the withdrawal of the embargo at the earliest \r\npossible date. India supports draft resolution A/71/L.3, \r\nsubmitted by Cuba.\r\nMr. Mangisi (Tonga): Let me start by recognizing \r\nand welcoming the Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nCuba, His Excellency Mr. Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez \r\nParrilla.\r\nWe also align our statement with that delivered by \r\nthe representative of the Kingdom of Thailand as Chair \r\nof the Group of 77 and China.\r\nAs speakers have reiterated before me, and as \r\nundoubtedly the majority will do so after me as well, the \r\ndecades of the operation of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by our friend the \r\nUnited States on another friend of ours, Cuba, has \r\ncaused and continues to cause significant economic \r\ndamage, counted in the billions of dollars, resulting in \r\nthe continuing immeasurable suffering of the people \r\nof Cuba. As the longest-lasting system of unilateral \r\nsanctions ever applied to one country, it unjustly hinders \r\nthe economic and social development of the Cuban \r\npeople. As a fellow small island developing State facing \r\nsimilar challenges, we feel and recognize the injustice \r\nof the embargo. We therefore join the call to end the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nagainst Cuba.\r\nOur call this morning cuts deeper, at a more \r\npersonal level as well. In talking about friendships \r\nbetween our country and the United States and Cuba, \r\nour solidarity regarding the hardships and challenges \r\nimposed on the Cuban people should be understood at \r\na personal level, given that we have nationals who are \r\nliving side by side with the Cuban people on the ground \r\nas students. As a friend of the United States, we wish \r\nto reiterate again to the United States that the effects of \r\nsuch an archaic form of interference and intervention in \r\nthe domestic and sovereign affairs of Cuba also results \r\nin undue difficulty to the lives of our nationals who are \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n12/27 16-34312\r\nstriving, along with the Cuban people, to get by on a \r\ndaily basis. \r\nMy Permanent Representative, who unfortunately \r\ncannot be here today because of official travel, looks \r\nforward to presenting his credentials in Havana next \r\nmonth and to meeting with our nationals in the hope of \r\ngetting some reprieve for them because of the difficult \r\nsituation that they are living in owing to the challenges \r\nimposed on them by the embargo, and thereby, by \r\nextension, on Tonga as a country. It is more personal \r\nto us to that extent, and, as a friend to a friend, we \r\nreach out to the United States to encourage it to see \r\nthe negativity that the embargo creates, not only in \r\nterms of its relationship with Cuba but also for other \r\ncountries that may be, or are, unduly affected as well \r\nby the embargo, like my own.\r\nWe recognize the positive steps that the United \r\nStates has taken to date in its relationship with Cuba. \r\nClearly, though, those steps may not be enough, as \r\nthe Cuban people, along with our own nationals, are \r\nstill experiencing challenges, which we often do not \r\nrecognize, and they are being deprived of things that \r\nwe take for granted here in the comforts of New York \r\nand at Headquarters. With elections looming here in \r\nthe host country, we pray that the good works of the \r\ncurrent Administration will be carried forward and \r\nthat, in the meantime, the President of the United \r\nStates will still use his executive powers to improve \r\nfurther its relations with Cuba before having to resort \r\nto congressional action.\r\nWe therefore reiterate our support for the right \r\nof the Cuban people to enjoy full freedom in their \r\neconomic and social development, and we call for an \r\nend to the embargo imposed upon them.\r\nMr. Moustafa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I align myself with the statements delivered \r\nby the representative of Thailand on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, by the representative of \r\nVenezuela on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, by the representative of Kuwait on behalf \r\nof the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and by the \r\nrepresentative of the Niger on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States. I would also like to make the following \r\nadditional brief remarks.\r\nIt is with great pleasure that we welcome His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of Cuba, and assure him of Egypt’s \r\nenduring full support for and solidarity with the people \r\nand the Government of Cuba.\r\nThis year has witnessed important developments \r\nin the bilateral relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates, including the visit by the United States President \r\nto Cuba last March. We welcome such developments \r\nin bilateral relations and encourage further steps along \r\nthat path. Nonetheless, the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States against \r\nCuba remains in place. The impact of such unilateral \r\nmeasures and the cost imposed on the Cuban people \r\nand economy are staggering. Between March 2015 \r\nand March 2016 the cost of the sanctions imposed on \r\nCuba has been estimated at over $4.68 billion — a \r\nstaggering amount.\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, Egypt will always be a \r\nsteadfast supporter of the rights of the Cuban people \r\nand their demands to end the current situation. We \r\nreject the current unilateral embargo policy, which \r\ntransgresses international legitimacy. For five decades \r\nthat policy has adversely affected the Cuban people’s \r\naccess to food, medicines, education and advanced \r\ntechnology.\r\nWe encourage the United States to take brave \r\ndecisions and steps to immediately lift of the embargo \r\nimposed on Cuba. We hope that such steps will pave \r\nthe way for the normalization of the bilateral relations \r\nbetween the two countries in all spheres.\r\nMr. Mminele (South Africa): South Africa aligns \r\nitself with the statements delivered by the representative \r\nof the Kingdom of Thailand on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China and by the representative of Venezuela \r\non behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nWe also acknowledge the presence of the Foreign \r\nMinister of Cuba.\r\nMy delegation supports draft resolution A/71/L.3. \r\nWe believe that it provides a good basis for finally \r\nending the embargo against Cuba and its people. South \r\nAfrica and Cuba have a long-standing relationship and \r\nsolidarity dating back to the struggle against apartheid \r\nand colonialism in Southern Africa. We take note of \r\nthe report of the Secretary-General (A/71/91) issued on \r\n21 July, which provides an assessment of where we are \r\non the issue.\r\nThe Government of South Africa welcomes the \r\nhistoric rapprochement between the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba and the visit to Cuba by President \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 13/27\r\nBarack Obama in March — the first visit to Cuba by a \r\nsitting President of the United States in nearly 90 years. \r\nWe hope that the next United States President will carry \r\nforward that rapprochement, as well as take all the \r\nnecessary measures within his or her broad executive \r\npowers to deal with all outstanding issues.\r\nSouth Africa remains seriously concerned about \r\nthe illegal nature of the imposition of the blockade and \r\nabout the immense human and economic suffering and \r\nhardship endured by the people of Cuba for more than \r\nhalf a century. Almost two years after the Governments \r\nof Cuba and the United States decided to rekindle their \r\ndiplomatic relations and begin a process towards the \r\nnormalization of their diplomatic relations, there have \r\nbeen no substantial changes in the application of the \r\nembargo policy in the national banking system.\r\nCuban monetary assets abroad continue to be \r\npersecuted by the embargo and its repercussions. That \r\nunhealthy state of affairs cannot be allowed to carry on, \r\nas it adversely affects the economic aspirations of Cuba \r\nand its people. It is critical that banking institutions in \r\nCuba be permitted to make financial transactions in \r\nUnited States dollars so that bilateral and commercial \r\nrelations between the two countries can be tangible \r\nand meaningful.\r\nThe current dire situation is aggravated by the \r\nstate of uncertainty faced by banks in third countries. \r\nWe would like to request Member States to support \r\nCuba and its people by scrapping any domestic laws or \r\nregulations that continue to hamper the development of \r\nCuba and its people.\r\nCuba continues to be a beacon of hope for many \r\ndeveloping countries, and it plays its role in making this \r\nworld a better place for all humankind. However, for \r\nCuba the embargo remains the most significant obstacle \r\nin its quest to realize its development objectives, \r\nincluding those enshrined in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nIn the midst of the current global challenges and \r\nrelated uncertainties that continue to hamper the \r\neconomic development of the Global South, there are \r\npositive activities taking place under South-South \r\ncooperation. In that regard, South Africa would like \r\nto make a special mention of one of Cuba’s many \r\ncontributions to South Africa.\r\nUnder the auspices of the South Africa-Cuba \r\nagreement on cooperation in the fields of public health \r\nand medical sciences, over 2,800 South African students \r\nare currently undertaking medical training in Cuba in \r\norder to help them qualify as medical doctors. So far, \r\n500 South Africans from disadvantaged backgrounds \r\nhave graduated as medical doctors after receiving \r\ntraining in Cuba.\r\nIn conclusion, the Republic of South Africa \r\nreiterates its unconditional support for the \r\nimplementation of this year’s draft resolution on the \r\nembargo. We take this opportunity to appeal once again \r\nto the international community to redouble its efforts \r\nto promote constructive and transparent dialogue \r\nbetween the two countries with a view to achieving the \r\nobjectives of all the many previous resolutions adopted \r\nby the United Nations on the matter and to ensuring the \r\nsustainable further progress of the people of Cuba. The \r\ninternational community cannot, and should not, wait \r\nany longer for this matter to be resolved, if we are truly \r\ncommitted to leaving no one behind.\r\nMr. Sobrai Duarte (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): My \r\ndelegation aligns itself with the statements made by the \r\nrepresentative of Thailand on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and by the representative of the Dominican \r\nRepublic on behalf of Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States. I make the following statement \r\nin my national capacity.\r\nFor decades the Brazilian Government has \r\nsupported the normalization of the relations between \r\nthe United States of America and Cuba. It was with \r\ngreat satisfaction that Brazil received the news of the \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between the two \r\ncountries, thus overcoming anachronistic animosities \r\nand generating positive effects for our entire region. It \r\nis especially symbolic that, almost 90 years after the \r\nlast United States presidential visit to Cuba, President \r\nBarack Obama visited Havana in March this year.\r\nWe enthusiastically welcome the recent \r\nappointments of the Cuban Ambassador to Washington \r\nand the United States Ambassador to Havana, which is \r\nstill awaiting approval from the United States Senate. \r\nWe also welcome the concrete measures directly \r\naffecting the lives of citizens in both countries, such as \r\nthe establishment of aerial, maritime and postal links \r\nand the facilitation of financial remittances.\r\nDespite those advances, the well-being of the Cuban \r\npeople, particularly those who are the poorest and most \r\nvulnerable, continues to be negatively affected by the \r\nblockade. We recognize the efforts of the President of \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n14/27 16-34312\r\nthe United States to put an end to the embargo, and we \r\nconsider it essential that the United States Congress \r\nbegin discussions regarding the elimination of the \r\nembargo. The lifting of the embargo against Cuba has \r\nthe indisputable support of the international community, \r\nmade clear by the 191 votes in favour of resolution 70/5 \r\nat the previous session of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation is confident that the time has come \r\nfor dialogue and cooperation, which could promptly \r\nlead to the end of the blockade.\r\nMr. Sevilla Borja (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe unilateral blockade imposed by the United States \r\nagainst Cuba for 56 years is a blatant example of the \r\nreprehensible implementation of power politics. It will \r\nremain in the annals of history as a clear demonstration \r\nof abusive behaviour by a super-Power against a \r\ndignified and proud people who jealously cling to their \r\nsovereignty. This is shameful disregard by that super-\r\nPower for international law and the virtually unanimous \r\nopinion of the international community, which year \r\nafter year at the General Assembly has demanded an \r\nend to that policy.\r\nThat behaviour comes from a country that in 1776 \r\ninspired the peoples of the world with its struggle \r\nfor decolonization, independence and freedom. It is \r\nthe country that joined the Allies to defeat nazism \r\nand fascism, thereby saving humankind. An original \r\nsignatory of the Charter of San Francisco, its people, \r\nunder the leadership of Martin Luther King, Jr., and \r\nMalcolm X, fought for the equality of human beings \r\nwithout regard for the colour of their skin. We hope that \r\nPresident Obama, who has lately taken bold, positive \r\nsteps with regard to Cuba, will now, at the end of his \r\nterm, adopt measures consistent with the best traditions \r\nof the history of his country.\r\nWith draft resolution A/71/L.3, which we will adopt \r\nin a few minutes, such anti-historical stubbornness \r\nto maintain an illegal and abusive blockade will be \r\nmorally condemned once more, to the embarrassment of \r\nits practitioners. The Cuban people already triumphed, \r\nand their revolution persists and serves as an example.\r\nMrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): We thank our dear colleagues from Cuba, \r\nincluding our brother and comrade Foreign Minister \r\nBruno Rodríguez, for their presence here today.\r\nWe appreciate the updated information for the year \r\n2016 that we have received in the Secretary-General’s \r\nreport on the impact of the criminal economic, financial \r\nand commercial blockade against the people and the \r\nGovernment of Cuba (A/71/91).\r\nCuba knows of and can be assured of our support \r\nand our unconditional solidarity. The Cuban revolution \r\nstarted with firmness and determination in its first \r\nsteps towards dignity and the restitution of the \r\npolitical, economic and social rights of the peoples \r\nof Latin America and the Caribbean. After a more \r\nthan five decades of resistance, the Cuban people and \r\nGovernment have created values personalizing dignity \r\nand sovereignty, reaffirming their socialist revolution \r\nand humanist values. \r\nCuba has always been the first to respond to our \r\nneeds of all kinds in disasters or emergency situations. \r\nWith reference to the Cuba of Fidel and Raúl and all \r\ntheir daughters and sons, Commander President Daniel \r\nOrtega rightly said at the ninetieth birthday celebration \r\nof Fidel:\r\n“We have learned so much from Fidel. He has \r\ntaught us so much by his ardent words, his \r\neloquence, his unique mission of justice, solidarity \r\nand complementarity in our efforts to unite \r\nand develop together our vigor and talents, our \r\ncultures and our citizenship in a free, sovereign \r\nand independent nation. Our American and \r\nCaribbean peoples — homeland and fighting \r\npeoples, homeland and valiant peoples, homeland \r\nand peoples who have forged revolution and \r\nevolution in dignity and pride.”\r\nWe are delighted with the restoration of the \r\nrelationship between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica. However, it is disappointing to note that the \r\nblockade continues. Despite the measures announced, \r\nthe blockade persists. There are also the persistent \r\nwill and policies to promote and impose changes in \r\nthe economic, political and social order of Cuba, and \r\nthe intention to continue developing programmes of \r\ninterference.\r\nIt is unacceptable to our country that coercive \r\nand unilateral economic measures are being used as \r\na selective political instrument to attack independent \r\npeoples and to implement policies of regime change. \r\nThe prolonged negative effect of the blockade has \r\nbeen and continues to be the main obstacle to the \r\nsustainable development of the Cuban people. It is \r\ntotally contrary to the approval of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and its implementation, to \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 15/27\r\nwhich all Member States have committed. The historic \r\nand anachronistic blockade imposed on that heroic \r\npeople and Government in violation of international \r\nlaw has been rejected by 191 countries, affirming that \r\nthe mobilizing role of the international community has \r\nbeen, and will continue to be, essential for the lifting of \r\nthe blockade.\r\nWhile the Government of the United States of \r\nAmerica persists in its failed and isolated policy \r\nagainst the people and Government of Cuba, and while \r\nit continues to ignore the universal call by the peoples \r\nof the world, including its own, the General Assembly \r\nwill continue to demand the end and total dismantling \r\nof its inhumane, illegal and criminal blockade, which \r\nis supported by just two countries that have rebelled \r\nagainst the will of the international community. As \r\nlong as the United States does not abandon its policy of \r\ninterference and imposition, whether through coercive \r\nmeasures or efforts to achieve a change of Government, \r\nagainst Cuba and other developing countries, we will \r\nhave to continue presenting draft resolutions on the \r\ntopic to the General Assembly. My delegation will \r\ncontinue to support such draft resolutions, including \r\nthat in A/71/L.3, presented today by our sister country \r\nof Cuba. We will vote in favour of it. \r\nThe international community hopes that in 2016 \r\nthe United States will finally demonstrate greater \r\npolitical will so that this draft resolution can be adopted \r\nwithout a vote and we can finally witness the end of the \r\nblockade against Cuba, which will require guarantees \r\nensuring the practical, total and complete dismantling \r\nof the blockade. Then the United States will be acting \r\nin harmony with the desires and aspirations of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate that Latin America and the \r\nCaribbean will continue to demand that the Government \r\nof the United States change its policy towards our \r\ncontinent. We want peace, respect and non-interference \r\nand the final and complete dismantling of the criminal \r\nblockade against Cuba, as well as the return to the \r\nfraternal Cuban people of their legitimate territory of \r\nGuantánamo.\r\nMs. Power (United States of America): For more \r\nthan 50 years, the United States had a policy aimed at \r\nisolating the Government of Cuba. For roughly half of \r\nthose years, Member States voted overwhelmingly for \r\na General Assembly draft resolution condemning the \r\nUnited States embargo and calling for it to be ended. \r\nThe United States has always voted against this draft \r\nresolution; today the United States will abstain. Let me \r\nexplain why.\r\nIn December 2014, President Obama made clear \r\nhis opposition to the embargo and called on our \r\nCongress to take action to lift it. Yet while the Obama \r\nAdministration agrees that the United States embargo \r\non Cuba should be lifted, it is not for the reason \r\nstated in the draft resolution before us (A/71/L.3). \r\nAll actions of the United States with regard to Cuba \r\nhave been, and are, in conformity with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and international law, including \r\napplicable trade law and the customary law of the \r\nsea. We categorically reject the statements in the draft \r\nresolution that suggest otherwise.\r\nBut the draft resolution being voted on today is \r\na perfect example of why the United States policy of \r\nisolation towards Cuba was not working — or worse, \r\nhow it was actually undermining the very goals it \r\nset out to achieve. Instead of isolating Cuba, our \r\npolicy has, as President Obama has repeatedly said, \r\nisolated the United States, including right here at the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nUnder President Obama we have adopted a new \r\napproach: rather than to try to close off Cuba from the \r\nrest of the world, we want the world of opportunities \r\nand ideas to open its doors to the people of Cuba. After \r\nover 50 years of pursuing the path of isolation, we have \r\nchosen to take the path of engagement, because, as \r\nPresident Obama said in Havana, we recognize that the \r\nfuture of the island of course lies in the hands of the \r\nCuban people.\r\nIn the nearly two years since President Obama \r\nannounced the shift in our approach, we have \r\namended the regulations implementing the embargo \r\nsix times — most recently on 14 October — while \r\nfinding ways to increase engagement between our \r\nGovernments and our peoples. We have re-established \r\ndiplomatic relations with the Government of Cuba, \r\nreopened embassies in our respective capitals, resumed \r\nregularly scheduled commercial f lights between the \r\nUnited States and Cuba, facilitated people-to-people \r\ntravel, eased restrictions on American businesses and \r\nentrepreneurs who want to do business in Cuba, and \r\nstopped limiting how often Cuban-Americans can visit \r\ntheir families on the island.\r\nPresident Obama memorably became the first \r\nsitting United States President to visit Cuba since 1928; \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n16/27 16-34312\r\nand, in a much more modest journey here in New York, \r\nI made the first visit by a United States Ambassador \r\nto the United Nations to Cuba’s Permanent Mission to \r\nthe United Nations since the Cuban revolution. Today \r\nwe add to that list the first United States abstention on \r\nthe General Assembly draft resolution calling for the \r\nembargo to be ended.\r\nAbstaining on the draft resolution does not mean \r\nthat the United States agrees with all of the policies \r\nand practices of the Cuban Government. We do \r\nnot. We are profoundly concerned by the serious \r\nhuman rights violations that the Cuban Government \r\ncontinues to commit with impunity against its own \r\npeople — including arbitrarily detaining those who \r\ncriticize the Government, threatening, intimidating \r\nand at times physically assaulting citizens who take \r\npart in peaceful marches and meetings and severely \r\nrestricting the access that people on the island have to \r\noutside information.\r\nAs President Obama made clear when he travelled \r\nto Havana, we believe that the Cuban people, like all \r\npeoples, are entitled to basic human rights, such as the \r\nright to speak their minds without fear and the right \r\nto assemble, organize and protest peacefully. We say \r\nthat not because those views reflect a United States-\r\ncentric conception of rights, but rather because they \r\nare universal human rights — enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and in the Universal Declaration \r\nof Human Rights — that all 193 Member States are \r\nsupposed to respect and defend. They are rights \r\nthat are essential for the dignity of men, women and \r\nchildren regardless of where they live or what kind of \r\nGovernment they have.\r\nLet me be among the first to acknowledge that, \r\nas our Cuban counterparts have often pointed out, the \r\nUnited States has work to do in ensuring those rights \r\nfor our own citizens. We know that at times in our \r\nhistory United States leaders and citizens have used the \r\npretext of promoting democracy and human rights in \r\nthe region to justify actions that have left a deep legacy \r\nof mistrust. We recognize that our history, in which \r\nthere is so much that makes us proud, also gives us \r\nample reason to be humble.\r\nWe also recognize the areas in which the Cuban \r\nGovernment has made significant progress in advancing \r\nthe welfare of its people, from significantly reducing its \r\nchild mortality rate to ensuring that girls have the same \r\naccess to primary and secondary school as boys.\r\nBut none of that means that we should stay \r\nsilent when the rights of the Cuban people are being \r\nviolated — as Member States here at the United \r\nNations have too often done. That is why the United \r\nStates raised those concerns directly with the Cuban \r\nGovernment during our historic dialogue on human \r\nrights in Havana on 14 October, which shows that, while \r\nour Governments continue to disagree on fundamental \r\nquestions of human rights, we have found a way to \r\ndiscuss those issues in a respectful and reciprocal \r\nmanner. We urge other Member States to speak up \r\nabout those issues as well.\r\nThe United States believes that there is a great \r\ndeal that we can do together with Cuba to tackle global \r\nchallenges. That includes here at the United Nations, \r\nwhere the decades-long enmity between our nations \r\nhas at best been a distraction from and, at worst, an \r\nobstacle to carrying out some of the most important \r\nwork of this institution and helping the world’s most \r\nvulnerable people.\r\nLet me conclude by giving just one example — a \r\nvery moving example. In 2014, we were confronted with \r\nthe deadliest outbreak of Ebola in our planet’s history. \r\nThe most dire predictions estimated that more than \r\n1 million people could be infected within a few months. \r\nYet while experts made clear that the only way to \r\nstop the epidemic was to confront it at its source, the \r\ninternational community was slow to step up. Many \r\nwere paralysed.\r\nIt was in that context that President Obama decided \r\nto deploy more than 3,000 United States personnel \r\nto the epicentre of the outbreak, where they joined \r\nhundreds of Americans working for non-governmental \r\norganizations and humanitarian agencies in the \r\nhardest-hit areas. President Obama also set about \r\nrallying other Member States to do their part. One \r\nof the very first countries to step forward was Cuba, \r\nwhich sent more than 200 health professionals to the \r\nregion — an awe-inspiring contribution for a country \r\nof just 11 million people.\r\nOne of them was a 43-year-old Cuban doctor \r\nnamed Félix Báez Sarría, who was dispatched to an \r\nEbola treatment unit in Sierra Leone. In the course of \r\ntreating those infected, Dr. Báez Sarría came down with \r\nthe symptoms of the virus, and he quickly went from \r\nbeing the doctor to being a patient. As his condition \r\ndeteriorated, he was airlifted to Geneva, where for \r\ntwo days he drifted in and out of consciousness. He \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 17/27\r\nnearly died, yet miraculously he pulled through, and \r\neventually returned to Havana, where he says he \r\nregained his strength by cradling his 2-year-old son.\r\nI would like members to think, just for one \r\nmoment, about what it took to save the life of Dr. Báez \r\nSarría — a man who risked his life to save people \r\nfrom a country on the other side of the world. He \r\nwas initially treated in the clinic where he worked, \r\nwhich had been built with the help of a United States-\r\nbased non-governmental organization. From there he \r\nwas transported to a clinic run by doctors from the \r\nBritish Ministry of Defence. Then he was airlifted to \r\nSwitzerland aboard a medical transport plane operated \r\nby an American charter service. Upon arriving at the \r\nhospital in Geneva he was treated by Swiss doctors \r\nwith a Canadian-developed experimental treatment.\r\nLook at all the nations that played a part in saving \r\nthe life of that brave doctor — a doctor who, after \r\nrecuperating in Havana, actually chose to return to \r\nSierra Leone so that he could rejoin his colleagues \r\nin the field in saving the lives of Sierra Leoneans. \r\nDr. Báez Sarría and all his colleagues belonged to \r\nCuba’s Henry Reeve Contingent, which responds to \r\ninternational disasters and epidemics. It takes its name \r\nfrom a young American born in Brooklyn, who at the \r\nage of 19 travelled to Cuba to join the country’s struggle \r\nfor independence and gave his life, in 1876, fighting \r\nalongside Cubans for their freedom.\r\nThe President returned to the Chair.\r\nWhen Dr. Báez Sarría returned to Sierra Leone he \r\nwas asked why he had come back after all he had been \r\nthrough. He said simply,\r\n“I needed to come back. Ebola is a challenge that I \r\nmust fight to the finish here in order to keep it from \r\nspreading to the rest of the world.”\r\nWhat I have just described is what the United \r\nNations looks like when it works. Noble efforts like \r\nthose are precisely why the United States and Cuba must \r\ncontinue to find ways to engage, even as our differences \r\npersist. Today we will take another small step to be able \r\nto do that. May there be many more — including, we \r\nhope, finally ending the United States embargo once \r\nand for all.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.3.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAlmost two years have passed since President Barack \r\nObama announced his willingness to use his executive \r\npowers and to work with Congress to lift the blockade \r\nagainst Cuba. During that period, the three Cuban \r\nanti-terrorist fighters returned; the unjustifiable \r\ninclusion of Cuba on the so-called list of State sponsors \r\nof international terrorism was eliminated; diplomatic \r\nrelations were restored and embassies were reopened in \r\nthe respective capitals; and the President of the United \r\nStates, the Secretary of State and other members of the \r\nCabinet visited Havana, along with dozens of senators, \r\nrepresentatives and persons from many sectors.\r\nThere is no doubt that progress has been made in \r\ndialogue and cooperation on issues of common interest, \r\nand a dozen agreements rendering reciprocal benefits \r\nhave been signed. And now the United States has just \r\nannounced that it will abstain in the voting on draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.3.\r\nHowever, the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade persists, harming the Cuban people and \r\nhindering the country’s economic development. Given \r\nits marked extraterritorial character, the blockade \r\nalso directly affects all States Members of the United \r\nNations. The United States leader and other senior \r\nofficials have described it as obsolete, useless in \r\nadvancing American interests, failed, meaningless and \r\nunviable, a burden for citizens that harms the Cuban \r\npeople and causes the United States to be isolated. The \r\nembargo should be lifted.\r\nIt has taken 24 years to change the lone vote of \r\nthe United States of America in this Hall. It has been \r\n24 years, as Ambassador Samantha Power has said, of \r\nisolation and failure. The 58 years of heroic resistance \r\nby our people serve as a backdrop for what is occurring. \r\nAt this time, I am thinking of my people, of Fidel and \r\nRaúl, and of the young Cubans who have inherited our \r\nlong, glorious struggle.\r\nSome people have asked me why I am introducing \r\nthe draft resolution again to the General Assembly. I \r\ncannot in any way underestimate the powerful political \r\nand moral message that the Assembly is sending to \r\nthe peoples of the world. Truth always opens the way; \r\njustice ends up winning. The abstention just announced \r\nis certainly a positive step for the future of improving \r\nrelations between the United States and Cuba. I thank \r\nAmbassador Power for her words and efforts. \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n18/27 16-34312\r\nHowever, most of the executive regulations and \r\nlaws establishing the blockade remain in force and \r\nare being rigorously implemented by United States \r\nGovernment agencies. We recognize that the executive \r\nmeasures adopted by the Government of the United \r\nStates are positive steps, but they have a very limited \r\nscope and effect. The measures taken in the area of \r\ntelecommunications, unfortunately, pursue openly \r\ndeclared political and interventionist objectives, but \r\nthey show how broad the powers of the President are. \r\nIf he wanted to, he could authorize, tomorrow, trade, \r\nprivate loans and investments in all sectors of the \r\nCuban economy.\r\nThe measures relating to trade with small private \r\nbusinesses — which measures are also, unfortunately, \r\nexplicitly politically motivated — will not work on a \r\nsubstantial scale as long as the economic organization \r\nand structures of Cuba’s foreign trade are not taken \r\ninto account. Nevertheless, they show that in the area \r\nof trade there could be progress even if the blockade \r\nlaws remain unchanged.\r\nSome United States spokespersons have said that \r\nthe Cuban system hinders the implementation of such \r\nmeasures. They know that that is not correct. It is the \r\nwhole of the embargo that determines the current reality. \r\nIt is obvious and well known that the President of the \r\nUnited States has broad executive powers that he has \r\nnot used. He could substantially modify the practical \r\nimplementation of the blockade and its humanitarian \r\nand economic impact.  Does this change of vote mean \r\nthat he will use those powers with determination? \r\nOnly 12 days ago, the United States Department \r\nof the Treasury and the Department of Commerce \r\nannounced new measures that, although positive, \r\nhave very limited scope. Mostly they are designed to \r\nbroaden previously authorized transactions. Rather \r\nthan benefit Cuba and the Cuban people, they favour \r\nthe United States.\r\nThere is some good news. From now on, United \r\nStates citizens who are authorized by their Government \r\nto visit Cuba or are travelling to other countries, \r\nwill be allowed to buy and carry with them in their \r\npersonal luggage Cuban products, without a limit on \r\nvalue, including rum and tobacco — whatever will fit \r\ninto their personal luggage. Nevertheless, exporting \r\nthose products to the United States is still prohibited. \r\nWhy is that? Unless there are specific licenses, the \r\nnew measures allow neither United States investments \r\nin our country nor joint ventures, not even for the \r\nproduction of Cuban pharmaceutical and biotechnology \r\nproducts — whose commercialization and distribution \r\nin the United States has, fortunately, been authorized, \r\nprovided they receive approval from the United States \r\nFood and Drug Administration.\r\nExports from the United States to Cuba have not \r\nbeen expanded beyond the previously authorized \r\nlimited sales, which exclude key sectors of the Cuban \r\neconomy. No announcement has been made of other \r\nchanges in the financial sector, thus the ban on opening \r\ntransfer accounts by Cuban banks in similar United \r\nStates institutions is still in effect.\r\nFor its part, the United States Congress has not \r\napproved any of the 20 amendments or legislative \r\ninitiatives that, with bipartisan support, have proposed \r\neliminating some restrictions in the blockade, or \r\neven the whole policy. On the contrary, more than 50 \r\nlegislative initiatives have been introduced that threaten \r\nto reinforce basic aspects of the blockade and to prevent \r\nthe President from issuing new executive orders or \r\nfrom implementing the measures already adopted. Nor \r\nhave specific Government actions been undertaken in \r\nthat regard.\r\nIt is therefore necessary to judge on the basis of \r\nthe facts. The most important and obvious step is \r\nto dismantle the blockade — more important than \r\nspeeches, press statements or even the vote of a \r\ndelegation in this Hall. To reiterate, we must judge on \r\nthe basis of the facts. \r\nThe human damage resulting from the blockade is \r\nincalculable. There is no Cuban family or industry in \r\nthe country that has not suffered its effects on health, \r\neducation, food, services, the prices of goods and \r\nwages and pensions. The imposition of discriminatory \r\nand onerous conditions, together with the deterrent \r\neffects of the blockade, restricts food purchases and \r\nacquisitions on the United States market of drugs, \r\nreagents, spare parts for medical equipment and \r\ninstruments and others.\r\nThe United States company Medtronic could not \r\nestablish contracts with Cuban companies to sell its \r\ndeep brain stimulators to treat Cuban patients with \r\nParkinson’s disease and other neurological disorders.\r\nVery recently it claimed this was due to restrictions of \r\nthe blockade. Nor was it possible for the multinational \r\ncompany Sigma-Aldrich to provide means of protection \r\nand chemical and biotechnological products requested \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 19/27\r\nby the Cuban company Farmacuba for the manufacture \r\nof drugs in the country.\r\nIn May, the United States Nuclear Regulatory \r\nCommission notified the United States branch of the \r\nGerman company Eckert and Ziegler that it would deny \r\nits application for a license to provide its products to the \r\nDutch company Philips, which is the calibration source \r\nfor medical equipment acquired by the Oncology \r\nInstitute in Cuba in 2013, affecting a vital service for \r\ncancer patients.\r\nOn 26 September, the Italian supplier of medical \r\nequipment Emildue notified the Cuban company \r\nMedicuba that the United States company Boston \r\nScientific Corporation refused to sell a radio-frequency \r\ngenerator of the Cosman brand for diagnosing cancer. \r\nThe blockade also affects the interests of American \r\ncitizens themselves, who could benefit from various \r\nservices in Cuba, including health care.\r\nI express thanks to Ambassador Samantha Power \r\nfor her heartfelt words, and I share her sentiments \r\nconcerning the symbolic case of Dr. Félix Sarría Báez. \r\nThat is an example of how much we could accomplish \r\nwhen there is international cooperation. \r\nHowever, it cannot be forgotten that during the \r\ntragic time of the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, \r\nthe deployment of Cuban medical aid was hampered \r\nby the refusal of the British Standard Chartered \r\nBank to make transfers between the World Health \r\nOrganization and the Cuban Medical Brigades, whose \r\nmembers — including  Dr. Sarría Báez — risked their \r\nlives serving in direct contact with patients. Even \r\nunder those extreme conditions, such transfers required \r\nspecific authorizations from the Treasury Department. \r\nThe Uganda branch of that bank closed the personal \r\naccounts of Cuban health workers in that country, and \r\na Barclays Bank subsidiary also prevented them from \r\nmaking transfers to Cuba. The same thing happened \r\nwith the Cuban cooperation personnel in the education \r\nsector in other countries. \r\nThese examples demonstrate the complex reality \r\nbetween the United States and Cuba. Nevertheless, this \r\nmorning’s focus is encouraging. Given the United States \r\nchange in vote, one could ask whether such practices \r\nwill cease.\r\nNo transfers were possible in August in cases \r\ninvolving maternal, child and ophthalmological \r\nservices in Algeria, owing to refusals on the part of \r\nthe transfer services of the Commerzbank of Germany \r\nand KBC Bank of Belgium. Under the shameful \r\nCuban Medical Professional Parole Program for \r\nCubans working in other countries, the United States \r\nattempts to hamper medical cooperation and to deprive \r\nthose countries and my own of indispensable, highly \r\nqualified human resources. Last month, banks based in \r\nPakistan refused to open a letter of credit requested by \r\na company of that country for the purchase of 100,000 \r\ndoses of the hepatitis B vaccine, on the grounds that \r\nCuba was a country under United States sanctions.\r\nThe legal ban preventing American citizens from \r\nfreely travelling to Cuba remains in force, which is a \r\nviolation of their civil liberties and rights — though \r\ntravel has been facilitated, under general licenses, \r\nonly for purposes corresponding to the 12 categories \r\nauthorized by United States law. A United States citizen \r\nruns the risk of paying a $100,000 fine for having \r\ntravelled to Cuba accompanied by several persons. \r\nThe blockade continues to be a massive, f lagrant \r\nand systematic violation of the human rights of all \r\nCuban men and women and qualifies as an act of \r\ngenocide under the Convention on the Prevention and \r\nPunishment of the Crime of Genocide, of 1948. It is an \r\nobstacle to international cooperation in humanitarian \r\nareas.\r\nAccording to rigorous, careful and conservative \r\nestimates, between April 2015 and March 2016, the \r\ndirect economic damage incurred by Cuba owing \r\ndirectly to the blockade amounted to $4.68 billion in \r\ntoday’s dollars. The economic damage accumulated \r\nover almost six decades amounts to $753,688 billion, \r\ntaking into account the depreciation in the price of \r\ngold. At current prices, that amounts to more than \r\n$125 billion dollars.\r\nThe blockade is the main obstacle to the economic \r\nand social development of our people. It constitutes \r\na f lagrant violation of international law, the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the Proclamation of Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean as a Zone of Peace. Its \r\nextraterritorial application adds greater magnitude to \r\nits character as a violation of international law. How \r\ncan one object to these claims? It suffices to read the \r\nlegal documents.\r\nWe welcomed the announcement by the United \r\nStates Department of the Treasury authorizing \r\nmy country to use the United States dollar in its \r\ninternational transactions. Thus far, however, Cuba has \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n20/27 16-34312\r\nbeen unable to make payments or cash deposits in that \r\ncurrency, owing to fines and the intimidating effects of \r\nthe blockade. And in third-party countries we have seen \r\nan increase in the cessation of operations, the closure of \r\nCuban bank accounts abroad, the denial of credit and \r\nthe rejection of transfers to or from Cuba.\r\nWhen trying to access from Cuba the website of the \r\nNorton division of the Symantec company — which, \r\namong other things, provides services for blocking and \r\nremoving malware and computer viruses — one reads, \r\n“In compliance with applicable United States laws, \r\nwe are unable to process your request.” Many other \r\nwebsites respond that the user does not have permission \r\nto access an Internet address from their server, or \r\nsimply state “access denied”.\r\nOther factors in addition to the blockade contribute \r\nto our economic difficulties. These include the unjust \r\ninternational economic order, the global crisis, the \r\nhistorical distortions and structural weaknesses \r\nof underdevelopment, high dependence on energy \r\nand food imports, the effects of climate change and \r\nnatural disasters, as well as — something that we do \r\nnot hide — our own mistakes. Our people and the \r\nGovernment have fought hard to overcome that reality.\r\nOn 17 April, President Raúl Castro Ruz said,\r\n “We have the will to develop a respectful dialogue \r\nand build a new kind of relationship with the United \r\nStates, such as has never existed between the two \r\ncountries, because we are convinced that it can \r\nonly result in mutual benefits.”\r\nMore recently, on 17 December, he added,\r\n “We reaffirm our desire for relations of civilized \r\ncoexistence with the United States, but Cuba will \r\nneither renounce even one of its principles nor \r\ncompromise on its sovereignty and independence.”\r\nHistorically, the Government of the United States \r\ninitially intended to annex Cuba, and when that failed, \r\nit tried to exercise domination over it. On the triumph \r\nof the Cuban revolution, the United States Government \r\nset out to\r\n“provoke disappointment and discouragement \r\nthrough economic dissatisfaction and hardships \r\n... denying Cuba money and supplies to reduce \r\nnominal and real salaries to provoke hunger, \r\ndesperation and overthrow the Government”.\r\nThe presidential policy directive published on \r\n14 October states that the Government of the United \r\nStates recognizes the sovereignty and self-determination \r\nof Cuba  and that it is up to the Cuban people to make \r\ntheir own choices about their future. However, its \r\nmisleading language does not hide the intent to alter \r\nthe constitutional order and promote changes in the \r\neconomic, political, social and cultural system of Cuba. \r\nNor does it hide the intention to continue to develop \r\ninterventionist programmes that serve the interests of \r\nthe United States, nor the intention to infiltrate them \r\ninto sectors of Cuban society. \r\nThe directive says that the United States will not \r\npursue regime change in Cuba, but it admits that the \r\nUnited States will\r\n “support Cuba’s emerging ... civil society; and \r\nencourage partners and non-governmental actors \r\nto join us in advocating for reforms. While \r\nremaining committed to supporting democratic \r\nactivists ... we will also engage community leaders, \r\nbloggers, activists, and other social-issue leaders \r\nwho can contribute to Cuba’s internal dialogue on \r\ncivic participation.”\r\nThe directive continues, stating that United States \r\nwill continue its \r\n“democracy and broadcasting programmes, while \r\nprotecting our interests and assets, such as the \r\nGuantánamo Bay Naval Station .... The United \r\nStates Government has no intention to alter the \r\nexisting lease treaty and other arrangements related \r\nto the Guantánamo Bay Naval Station”.\r\nWhen the directive was presented, it was said that \r\n“We cannot simply sit back and wait for Cuba to change \r\nwithout getting involved.” \r\nThe directive claims that Cuba remains indebted \r\nto the United States Government for bilateral debts \r\nincurred before the Cuban revolution. Maybe they \r\nthink that the Cuban revolution will pay the debts of \r\nthe bloody dictator Fulgencio Batista? They should \r\nunderstand that we are already free, precisely because \r\nin 1959 we rid ourselves of United States imperialism \r\nand the dictatorship that it imposed on us.\r\nGeorge W. Bush’s “Initiative for a New Cuba” of \r\n19 May 2002 sought to link the easing of the travel and \r\ntrade bans in place to internal political and economic \r\nchanges. Cubans responded on 26 June this year with \r\n8 million signatures in support of the constitutional \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 21/27\r\namendment — which is part of the Constitution of the \r\nRepublic of Cuba — that proclaims the irrevocable \r\nnature of socialism in our country.\r\nIt would be worthwhile to acknowledge that change \r\nin Cuba is a sovereign matter of Cubans alone and \r\nthat Cuba is a truly independent country. That is so \r\nbecause it gained its independence on its own and has \r\ndefended it, and will continue to defend it, at the price \r\nof the greatest sacrifices and risks. It must known that \r\nour people seized power, they empowered themselves \r\nlong ago, and they daily exercise sovereign power, the \r\npeople’s power. Only that explains why we are here \r\ntoday. \r\nWe are proud of our history and our culture, which \r\nare our most prized treasures. We will never forget our \r\npast, because that is the way to never go back to it. We \r\nhave already chosen our path towards the future. We \r\nknow that it is long and difficult, but we will not deviate \r\nfrom it out of naiveté or because of sirens’ songs  or by \r\nerror. No force on Earth can force us to do that. We \r\nhave seen many dreams come true, both ours and those \r\nwe have shared with other peoples. We have plenty of \r\ndreams that have yet to be realized. But they are our \r\ndreams. We do not need dreams that are alien to our \r\nculture or to our history.\r\nThe Cuban revolution was made, and is being \r\nmade every day, for the young people and by the young \r\npeople. Cuban youth, who seem to be so much of their \r\ntime, are just as patriotic and anti-imperialist as their \r\nparents and grandparents. We have defended, and we \r\nwill defend, our own values  and symbols, which we \r\nwill be enriching, but they will always be Cuban. We \r\nwill never change them for others that are alien to us. \r\nWe will struggle to build a nation that is sovereign, \r\nindependent, socialist, democratic, prosperous and \r\nsustainable. We will not return to capitalism. As was \r\nstated by the Leader of the Revolution, Fidel Castro \r\nRuz, on last 19 April:\r\n“We will improve what needs to be improved, \r\nwith steadfast loyalty and united strength, \r\nas Martí, Maceo and Gómez did during their \r\nunstoppable march.”\r\nThe lifting of the blockade is the key to our \r\nbeing able to advance towards the normalization of \r\nrelations with the United States. It is what will give \r\nsome meaning, depth and soundness to what has been \r\nachieved. The blockade is unjust, inhuman, immoral \r\nand illegal, and should unilaterally and unconditionally \r\ncease. The change in vote that Ambassador Power just \r\nannounced is a promising sign. We hope that it will be \r\nreflected in reality. \r\nWe are deeply grateful to all the Governments \r\nand peoples, parliaments, political parties and \r\nsocial movements, civil society representatives and \r\ninternational and regional organizations that have \r\ncontributed their voices or votes, year after year, to \r\nsupport the justness and urgency of the abolition of \r\nthe blockade.\r\nWe convey our sincere gratitude to the American \r\npeople for their growing support for this lofty cause.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe debate on this item.\r\nWe shall now proceed to consider draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.3.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the speaker in explanation \r\nof vote before the voting, may I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nI now call on the representative of Israel.\r\nMr. Danon (Israel): Israel welcomes the progress \r\nachieved in the relations between the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba and hopes that it will lead to a new \r\nera in the region.\r\nThe President: We have heard the only speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote before the voting.\r\nThe General Assembly will now take a decision on \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.3, entitled “Necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba”.\r\nA recorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAustralia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Bahrain, \r\nBangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Belgium, Belize, \r\nBenin, Bhutan, Bolivia (Plurinational State of), \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei \r\nDarussalam, Bulgaria, Burkina Faso, Burundi, \r\nCabo Verde, Cambodia, Cameroon, Canada, \r\nCentral African Republic, Chad, Chile, China, \r\nColombia, Comoros, Congo, Costa Rica, Côte \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n22/27 16-34312\r\nd’Ivoire, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic, \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Denmark, Djibouti, \r\nDominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, \r\nEl Salvador, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Estonia, \r\nEthiopia, Fiji, Finland, France, Gabon, Gambia, \r\nGeorgia, Germany, Ghana, Greece, Grenada, \r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Guyana, Haiti, \r\nHonduras, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Iran \r\n(Islamic Republic of), Iraq, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, \r\nJapan, Jordan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kiribati, \r\nKuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic, Latvia, Lebanon, Lesotho, Liberia, \r\nLibya, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, \r\nMadagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, Maldives, Mali, \r\nMalta, Marshall Islands, Mauritania, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Micronesia (Federated States of), Monaco, \r\nMongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Mozambique, \r\nMyanmar, Namibia, Nauru, Nepal, Netherlands, \r\nNew Zealand, Nicaragua, Niger, Nigeria, Norway, \r\nOman, Pakistan, Palau, Panama, Papua New \r\nGuinea, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of \r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent \r\nand the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, Sao \r\nTome and Principe, Saudi Arabia, Senegal, Serbia, \r\nSeychelles, Sierra Leone, Singapore, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, South \r\nAfrica, South Sudan, Spain, Sri Lanka, Sudan, \r\nSuriname, Swaziland, Sweden, Switzerland, \r\nSyrian Arab Republic, Tajikistan, Thailand, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Timor-\r\nLeste, Togo, Tonga, Trinidad and Tobago, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, Uganda, Ukraine, \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, United Kingdom of Great \r\nBritain and Northern Ireland, United Republic \r\nof Tanzania, Uruguay, Uzbekistan, Vanuatu, \r\nVenezuela (Bolivarian Republic of), Viet Nam, \r\nYemen, Zambia, Zimbabwe.\r\nAgainst:\r\nNone\r\nAbstentions:\r\nIsrael, United States of America.\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.3 was adopted by 191 votes \r\nto none, with 2 abstentions (resolution 71/5).\r\nThe President: Before giving the f loor to speakers \r\nin explanation of vote after the voting, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats.\r\nMr. Ružička (Slovakia): Slovakia extends its \r\ncongratulations to the Cuban delegation.\r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU) and its member States. The candidate \r\ncountries the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nMontenegro, Serbia and Albania; the country of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidate Bosnia and Herzegovina; Liechtenstein, a \r\nEuropean Free Trade Association country and member \r\nof the European Economic Area; and the Republic of \r\nMoldova align themselves with this statement.\r\nSince the re-establishment of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States and President \r\nObama’s appeals to the United States Congress to \r\nstart working towards the elimination of the embargo, \r\nthe situation has further evolved. The EU warmly \r\nwelcomes the measures already taken and encourages \r\ntheir further implementation through relevant steps \r\nby both sides. In the meantime, however, fundamental \r\nrestrictive measures are still in place. Under the new \r\ncircumstances, they are even more of an anachronism.\r\nBeyond the damaging impact of the embargo \r\non ordinary Cubans, the effects and side effects \r\nof extraterritorial legislation and of unilateral \r\nadministrative and judicial measures are also negatively \r\naffecting the economic interests of all. This requires \r\neven more urgent action, given the greater opening \r\nof the Cuban economy. American legislation such as \r\nthe Cuban Democracy Act and the Helms-Burton Act \r\nextended the effects of the United States embargo to \r\nthird-party countries. In the framework of its common \r\ncommercial policy, the European Union has firmly and \r\ncontinuously opposed such extraterritorial measures. \r\nWhile recognizing the decisions of the United States \r\nGovernment to lift sanctions and restrictions on \r\nremittances and family travel to Cuba, to allow the \r\nprovision of certain telecommunications, Internet and \r\nfinancial services and to export tools and building \r\nmaterials in order to support the Cuban people, we \r\ncannot accept the unilaterally imposed measures that \r\nimpede economic and commercial relations with Cuba.\r\nIn that context, we warmly welcome the United \r\nStates and Israeli abstention in the voting.\r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 23/27\r\nContrary to our expectations, the situation for EU \r\nfinancial operators in and with Cuba that are targeted \r\nby extraterritorial sanctions has not improved, and has \r\neven worsened in some ways. This constitutes undue \r\ninterference and problems for EU citizens, businesses \r\nand non-governmental organizations living, working or \r\noperating in Cuba. We expect an early solution to those \r\nproblems, as normalization with Cuba should apply to \r\nall interested parties.\r\nAt a summit between the European Union and the \r\nUnited States in London in May 1998, a package was \r\nagreed upon that also sought to alleviate the problems \r\nwith extraterritorial legislation. We advocate the \r\nprompt and full implementation of that agreement.\r\nThe negotiations on a political dialogue and \r\ncooperation agreement concluded in March. That \r\nagreement aims to consolidate relations and create \r\nan enabling framework for more effective dialogue, \r\nimproved cooperation and expanded economic relations. \r\nThe agreement is now being finalized and is slated to be \r\nsigned in the coming months. The bilateral agreement \r\nwill put the entire EU-Cuban relationship on a new and \r\nsolid legal footing. It will also be a game-changer for \r\nour relationship and will open more doors and forums \r\nfor dialogue with Cuba, including on the issues on \r\nwhich we still have fundamental differences.\r\nHuman rights are at the core of EU external \r\nrelations. The second high-level discussion on these \r\nissues took place in Havana in June. We are encouraged \r\nthat no subject will be off limits in those processes. \r\nThe EU remains determined to pursue a comprehensive \r\ndialogue with the Cuban authorities and all sectors of \r\nCuban society. \r\nWe reiterate the right of Cuban citizens to \r\nmake independent decisions about their future. We \r\ncall on the Cuban Government to fully grant its \r\ncitizens internationally recognized civil, political \r\nand economic rights and freedoms, including the \r\nfreedom of assembly and the freedom of expression \r\nand free access to information, as well as to ratify the \r\nInternational Covenant on Civil and Political Rights \r\nand the International Covenant on Economic, Social \r\nand Cultural Rights. Following the visit of the United \r\nNations Special Rapporteur on the right to food, the \r\nCuban Government should extend invitations to other \r\nrapporteurs to visit Cuba.\r\nWe note with concern the continued high \r\nfrequency of short-term arrests, but at the same time \r\nwe welcome the continued broad application of Cuban \r\ncitizens’ freedom to travel. We also welcome Cuban \r\nachievements in health care and education. On the \r\nother hand, the slow pace of economic modernization \r\nseriously hampers Cuban economic development. In \r\nthat context, we recall the August 2011 adoption of a \r\npackage of economic and social reforms by the Cuban \r\nGovernment. We expect that they will be extended and \r\nimplemented in a manner that will address the key \r\nneeds of the Cuban population.\r\nThe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States contributes to the \r\neconomic problems in Cuba, thus negatively affecting \r\nthe standard of living of the Cuban people and \r\naggravating the humanitarian situation there. Lifting \r\nthe United States embargo could facilitate the opening \r\nof the Cuban economy, to the benefit of the people of \r\nCuba. We again express our rejection of all unilateral \r\nmeasures directed against Cuba that negatively affect \r\nthird parties’ interests and thereby violate commonly \r\naccepted rules of international trade.\r\nIn the framework of our comprehensive agreement, \r\nwe will work with Cuban counterparts to consolidate \r\nand expand improvements in all of the areas I \r\nmentioned. Through its cooperation and the future \r\nframework agreement, the European Union is ready \r\nto accompany Cuba along its path of reform and \r\nmodernization. Substantial progress has been achieved \r\nin a constructive spirit on the topics of human rights, \r\ngovernance and civil society, inter alia.\r\nAgainst that background, the member States of \r\nthe European Union unanimously voted in favour of \r\nresolution 71/5. Once again, I congratulate the Cuban \r\ndelegation for the result of the voting.\r\nMr. Ri Tong Il (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): The delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to join the previous speaker \r\nin extending its warm and heartfelt congratulations to \r\nthe Cuban delegation.\r\nLet me first express our intention to associate \r\nourselves with the statements by the representative of \r\nVenezuela and the representative of Thailand on behalf \r\nof the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, respectively.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea voted in favour of resolution 71/5, \r\non the necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n24/27 16-34312\r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States \r\nof America against Cuba. My delegation condemns \r\nthe United States embargo against Cuba as an active \r\nencroachment upon its sovereignty, a crime against \r\nhumanity and an infringement of human rights, in \r\nviolation of the Charter of the United Nations. The \r\nUnited States has been imposing a unilateral economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against the Republic \r\nof Cuba since its foundation.\r\nThe unilateral United States embargo, which has \r\nthreatened the sovereignty of Cuba and its right to \r\nexist, is an act of hostile United States policy against \r\nCuba. The damage done to the economy of Cuba due \r\nto the United States economic embargo is estimated \r\nto have reached astronomical figures. In spite of the \r\nestablishment of diplomatic relations between the two \r\ncountries last year, the atrocious United States economic \r\nembargo continues to this day. There have been only a \r\nfew modifications to its implementation measures, but \r\nthe overall United States policy towards Cuba to bring \r\nabout regime change through an economic embargo has \r\nnever changed.\r\nThe adoption of resolution 71/5 at the current \r\nsession, as a follow-up to resolutions adopted in \r\nprevious sessions, is a reflection of the goodwill of the \r\ninternational community and shows the Government \r\nand the people of Cuba the General Assembly’s support \r\nand solidarity. \r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea takes this opportunity to extend its strong \r\nsupport for, and solidarity with, the Government and \r\nthe people of Cuba as they struggle to safeguard their \r\ndignity and civility in their stand against the continuance \r\nof the unilateral embargo by the United States.\r\nMr. Rzheussky (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nthe Cuban delegation on the outcome of the voting on \r\nresolution 71/5.\r\nThe Republic of Belarus welcomes the positive \r\nsteps made since 2015 in terms of restoring diplomatic \r\nrelations between the United States of America and \r\nCuba, the holding of meetings between leaders of the two \r\ncountries and the easing of certain restrictive measures \r\nagainst Cuba, including the decision announced today \r\nabout abstaining in the voting on today’s resolution. \r\nWe also welcome the signing of an agreement on the \r\nnormalization of relations between the European Union \r\nand Cuba.\r\nThe easing by the United States of America of \r\ncertain sanctions against Cuba in the banking and \r\ntourism sectors, the restoration of direct postal and \r\ntrade communications and the delisting of Cuba from \r\nthe Department of State’s list of State sponsors of \r\nterrorism are important steps in the right direction. \r\nHowever, those steps are clearly insufficient as long as \r\na general trade embargo against Cuba remains in effect.\r\nWe have repeatedly stressed that the imposition \r\nof unilateral coercive measures as a means of exerting \r\npolitical and economic pressure on developing countries \r\ncontravenes the core principles of international law \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nin the Declaration on Principles of International Law \r\nconcerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation among \r\nStates in accordance with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Any attempts by certain States to alter the \r\ninternal political systems of other States through \r\nmilitary, political, economic or other means of coercion \r\nare inadmissible and counterproductive. That such \r\nmeasures are counterproductive was acknowledged \r\ntoday by the Permanent Representative of the United \r\nStates, Ms. Samantha Power.\r\nPresident Obama’s recent decision to extend the \r\ntrade sanctions against Cuba for another year is at \r\nodds with the recent steps and statements by officials \r\nin Washington. Not only does the decision hamper the \r\ndevelopment of the Cuban economy and encroach upon \r\nthe rights and interests of both American and Cuban \r\ncitizens, it also casts doubt upon the willingness of the \r\nUnited States to genuinely normalize relations with \r\nCuba.\r\nBelarus urges a prompt and full lifting of the \r\neconomic, financial and trade embargo against Cuba \r\nby the United States of America. Only a full lifting \r\nof sanctions can demonstrate the intent of the United \r\nStates to normalize bilateral relations with Cuba.\r\nMs. Mejía Vélez (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\ncongratulate the Minister for Foreign Affairs of Cuba, \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, and his entire delegation \r\non the adoption of resolution 71/5. The voting on the \r\nresolution we witnessed a few minutes ago was a historic \r\nevent, as those who previously opposed this annual \r\nresolution have taken into account the rapprochement \r\nand improvement of relations between the United States \r\nand Cuba and decided to abstain.\r\nAs stated by all of those who have spoken before \r\nme, the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 25/27\r\nimposed by the United States against Cuba is contrary \r\nto international law and the spirit and the letter of the \r\nprinciples set out in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nSince the adoption of resolution 47/19 in November \r\n1992, Colombia, like all countries in Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean and the immense majority of Member \r\nStates, has expressed its unrestricted support for Cuba \r\nand voted in favour of subsequent iterations of that \r\nresolution, including the one we have just adopted \r\ntoday.\r\nToday was no exception. Support was reflected \r\nin the 191 votes in favour, which matched that for the \r\nresolution adopted at last year’s session (resolution \r\n70/5), which emphasized the need to put an end to a \r\npolicy of more than 50 years — as the President of \r\nColombia, Mr. Juan Manuel Santos Calderón, has \r\nexpressed on repeated occasions.\r\nMy country reaffirms its policy of respect for \r\ninternational law and for the principles of political \r\nindependence, self-determination of peoples, \r\nnon-intervention and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other nations. Colombia believes it \r\nindispensable that Member States make progress in \r\nbuilding relations of cooperation and friendship based \r\non multilateralism and respect for the principle of \r\nsovereign equality enshrined in Chapter I of the United \r\nNations Charter.\r\nWe note with optimism the renewal of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States of \r\nAmerica, as well as steps taken to improve their \r\nrelations, with the understanding, as we have heard \r\nhere, that a great deal remains to be done. We trust \r\nthat, in following this path, the embargo will finally \r\nbe lifted.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, I wish to welcome the presence \r\nof Cuba’s Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla, and to thank him for his very \r\ndetailed statement.\r\nArgentina fully aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of Thailand on behalf of \r\nthe Group of 77 and China and by the representative \r\nof Dominican Republic on behalf of the Community of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States, and wishes to \r\nmake the following points in our national capacity.\r\nThe historic position of Argentina has been, and \r\ncontinues to be, that the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo bythe United States against Cuba \r\nis contrary to international law and must urgently be \r\nlifted. In the framework of our absolute commitment to \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and to multilateralism, \r\nArgentina is opposed to the use of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures, the extraterritorial implementation of \r\nnational laws and the adoption of discriminatory \r\ncommercial practices. In that regard, Argentina is in \r\naccord with the demand of the international community \r\nto lift the blockade and the laws and regulations that \r\nsupport that policy.\r\nArgentina has traditionally supported resolutions \r\nof the General Assembly against the blockade and has \r\nspoken against the blockade on every occasion when \r\nthe subject has arisen, in both regional forums and \r\nother international organizations. Argentina expressed \r\nits satisfaction and optimism about the process initiated \r\nat the end of 2014 by the Governments of the United \r\nStates and Cuba to normalize bilateral relations and \r\ncongratulates both Governments on the decision to \r\nundertake the path of dialogue, which will allow them \r\nto resolve all pending questions — including the lifting \r\nof the blockade.\r\nWe welcome the progress achieved in the past \r\nnearly two years, which includes the reopening of \r\nembassies in both capitals and the visits of the President \r\nof the United States to Cuba and Cuban authorities \r\nto Washington,  as well as the executive measures \r\nimplemented by the United States Department of the \r\nTreasury and the Department of Commerce, which \r\nintroduced amendments to regulations. Those steps in \r\nthe right direction mark a new era of Cuban-American \r\nbilateral relations that seeks to leave behind a history of \r\ndisagreement and assumes a mutual recognition by both \r\nGovernments as legitimate and equal interlocutors.\r\nNevertheless, we regret that the laws underpinning \r\nthe embargo are still in effect. Their implementation \r\ncontinues to impede the full development of the Cuban \r\npeople. \r\nWe welcome the fact that there were no votes \r\nagainst the adoption of today’s resolution. We hope \r\nthat this will be the last time the General Assembly \r\nadopts a resolution on this issue. We furthermore hope \r\nthat next year the provisions of the resolution will \r\nbecome abstractions, thereby consigning the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba to the \r\npast.\r\nA/71/PV.32 26/10/2016\r\n26/27 16-34312\r\nMr. Rosselli (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): At \r\nthe outset, I welcome the presence of the Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Cuba, Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla.\r\nFrankly, this is the type of statement that I would \r\nprefer not to have to make — in the first place because \r\nthe embargo is still in place, but also because for more \r\nthan 30 years I have been making statements of this \r\ntype here, in the old General Agreement on Tariffs and \r\nTrade, in the World Trade Organization, in the Union \r\nof South American Nations, in the Latin American \r\nIntegration Association, in the Common Market of the \r\nSouth and in the Community of Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States (CELAC). We would have preferred \r\nseeing that the situation had already changed.\r\nAs in previous years, Uruguay voted in favour of \r\nthe resolution 71/5, introduced by the delegation of \r\nCuba, because the blockade against Cuba runs counter \r\nto the rules of international law and the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, in \r\nparticular non-intervention, peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes and the legal equality of States. \r\nOn principle, Uruguay rejects and does not recognize \r\nin its own national legislation the extraterritorial \r\napplication of domestic laws of other States and direct \r\nor indirect measures that constitute unilateral action \r\nby any State that has as its objective sanctioning the \r\nsovereign decisions of another country in the political, \r\neconomic, commercial, social and cultural spheres or \r\nany other area. In that connection, we condemn the \r\napplication of unilateral coercive measures by the \r\nUnited States against Cuba.\r\nWe welcome the re-establishment of diplomatic \r\nrelations between the Government of Cuba and the \r\nGovernment of the United States, which we acknowledge \r\nto be a positive step towards a new chapter in relations \r\nbetween the two countries. We welcome the removal of \r\nCuba from the list of State sponsors of terrorism. \r\nNevertheless, we must put an end to the effects of \r\nthe blockade that is still in place and affects the Cuban \r\npeople with an economic and humanitarian burden. We \r\ncertainly welcome the change of vote by the United \r\nStates delegation to abstention, which means that the \r\nresolution was adopted today without opposition.\r\nOur country believes that the sanctions and \r\nextraterritorial laws imposed against Cuba not only are a \r\nviolation of international law, but also have inestimable \r\nconsequences for the economic development of the \r\nCaribbean country. They are a way of depriving the \r\nCuban people of the right to development, and they \r\ninflict a level of damage against their dignity and \r\nsovereignty that is impossible to quantify. \r\nIn voting in favour of resolution 71/5, Uruguay \r\nreiterates its commitment to multilateralism as a \r\nlegitimate instrument for solving such disputes between \r\nStates and an efficient way to promote international \r\ncooperation, human rights, security and understanding \r\namong people.\r\nUruguay aligns itself with the statements made by \r\nthe representative of the Dominican Republic on behalf \r\nof CELAC and by the representative of Thailand on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China.\r\nMr. Mra (Myanmar): I take the f loor today to \r\nexplain the vote of my delegation on resolution 71/5, \r\nentitled “Necessity of ending the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”, which was just adopted by an \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of Singapore on behalf of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations, by the \r\nrepresentative of Thailand on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and by the representative of Venezuela and \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries.\r\nMyanmar voted in favour of the resolution to \r\ndemonstrate once again our firm opposition to any \r\nunilateral economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargoes imposed against any country. We fully \r\nunderstand the degree of loss and suffering caused \r\nby sanctions, because we have gone through similar \r\nexperiences for decades. In the end, sanctions are \r\ncounterproductive and affect only the innocent people \r\nof the country concerned.\r\nAs a member of the Non-Aligned Movement, \r\nMyanmar has steadfastly adhered to the principled \r\nposition of the Movement in opposing the use of \r\nunilateral economic and trade sanctions. Sanctions \r\nare also contrary to the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nas well as to the international law principle of good-\r\nneighbourliness. Myanmar has always maintained \r\nthat the relations among members of the international \r\ncommunity should be based on mutual respect, and \r\ndifferences should be resolved through peaceful \r\nconsultations.\r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.32\r\n16-34312 27/27\r\nMyanmar welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between Cuba and the United \r\nStates represented by the reopening of their respective \r\nembassies in Havana and Washington, the historic visit \r\nby President Obama to Cuba in March and the easing \r\nof restrictions, including steps taken by the United \r\nStates with regard to the Cuban draft resolution. These \r\nare important steps in enhancing bilateral relations and \r\ncharting a new road map in order to build a brighter \r\nfuture for the present and future generations of both \r\ncountries. Myanmar hopes that those important \r\nundertakings will lead to the earliest possible lifting \r\nof all the remaining restrictions imposed against Cuba.\r\nLast September, world leaders gathered here at the \r\nUnited Nations to adopt the ambitious 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development to move everyone, including \r\nour planet, towards a sustainable future. Member \r\nStates also committed to working tirelessly for the \r\nfull and effective implementation of the Goals and \r\ntargets because they will open up new prospects and \r\nopportunities for global development and cooperation. \r\nOne significant thing about this historic Agenda is that \r\nit calls for not leaving anyone behind. We are of the \r\nview that sanctions should be completely eliminated so \r\nthat everyone will have the opportunity to achieve the \r\nGoals and targets of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nFor the reasons I mentioned, Myanmar once again \r\nvoted in favour of the resolution. I offer congratulations \r\nto the Cuban delegation for the impressive result.\r\nMr. Phansourivong (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): The Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\naligns itself with the statements delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\non behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, \r\nby the representative of the Kingdom of Thailand \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China, and by the \r\nrepresentative of the Republic of Singapore on behalf of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nCooperation and engagement are key factors for \r\npeaceful coexistence and mutual benefit in the era \r\nof interdependence. In that respect, the Lao People’s \r\nDemocratic Republic welcomes the important progress \r\nmade in the past year on the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the Republic of Cuba and \r\nthe United States of America, including the reopening \r\nof embassies in both respective capitals, as well as the \r\nhistoric visit to Cuba by President Barack Obama, which \r\nhas opened a new chapter in the relations between the \r\ntwo countries, which have been stalled for decades. The \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic also welcomes the \r\ndecision of the United States to abstain in voting on \r\nresolution 71/5, which is another positive step.\r\nWith the current positive developments in relations \r\nbetween the Republic of Cuba and the United States \r\nof America, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\nstrongly hopes that the progress made thus far will be \r\nfurther enhanced, leading to the lifting of the unilateral \r\nembargo against the Republic of Cuba in the near \r\nfuture. The Lao People’s Democratic Republic believes \r\nthat lifting the embargo will be beneficial not only to \r\nboth countries, but to the international community. \r\nFurthermore, the lifting of the embargo will create an \r\nenvironment conducive to further enhancing dialogue \r\nand cooperation between the two countries and enable \r\nCuba to engage in trade and economic exchange with \r\nnations around the world, including the United States of \r\nAmerica, thereby contributing to improving the well-\r\nbeing of the Cuban people and the development of their \r\ncountry. I warmly congratulate the Cuban delegation.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nexplanation of vote for this meeting. We shall hear the \r\nremaining speakers at 3 p.m. here in the Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m. \r\n"
