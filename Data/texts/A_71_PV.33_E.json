"United Nations A/71/PV.33\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n33rd plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 26 October 2016, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. El Haycen \r\n(Mauritania), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 39 (continued)\r\nNecessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/91)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): Before \r\ngiving the f loor to speakers in explanation of vote after \r\nthe voting on resolution 71/5, may I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Murtada Abu Obaida (Sudan) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the representative of the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela on behalf of the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries, the representative of the \r\nNiger on behalf of the Group of African States, the \r\nrepresentative of Thailand on behalf of the Group of 77 \r\nand China and the representative of Kuwait on behalf \r\nof the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (see A/71/\r\nPV.32).\r\nParagraph 30 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment urges Member States to refrain from \r\nimplementing economic, financial and commercial \r\nunilateral measures that run counter to the principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and international \r\nlaw, especially measures imposed against developing \r\ncountries such as Cuba. The 2030 Agenda therefore \r\nreaffirms the illegality of the embargo policy. My \r\ncountry actively contributed to the drafting and \r\nadoption of all resolutions on coercive measures and \r\nunilateral sanctions, as well as the 2030 Agenda, which \r\nwe back fully.\r\nWe welcome the progress made in the relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States and the visit \r\nof United States President Barack Obama to Cuba \r\nin March, where he stressed his intention to work \r\non ending the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba, restoring diplomatic \r\nrelations between the two countries and removing Cuba \r\nfrom the list of State sponsors of terrorism. Those are \r\nall positive steps, and we expect to see further steps \r\nthat will lead to lifting the embargo and normalizing \r\nrelations between the two countries.\r\nSince 1997, my people have suffered under an \r\nunjust unilateral embargo that is renewed annually. It \r\nhas adversely affected all aspects of life, as it restricts \r\nbanking transactions and our access to grants and loans \r\nand spare parts for aircraft and railroads. That has \r\neven led to airplane crashes, resulting in the deaths of \r\nmany women, children and men. It has also affected \r\nour opportunities for international cooperation, and \r\nit impacted our progress in achieving the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWe express our solidarity with Cuba, as we share its \r\nunderstanding of the suffering and losses incurred by \r\nthe Cuban people and the impact that it has had on the \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Without a doubt, the poor have suffered \r\nthe most. We value the step taken by the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights in Geneva to \r\nappoint a Special Rapporteur on the negative impact \r\nof unilateral coercive measures on the enjoyment of \r\nhuman rights. We call for Member States to support and \r\nto help implement the recommendations in the report \r\nintroduced in the Human Rights Council in Geneva, \r\nwhere the Special Rapporteur spoke about the impact of \r\ncoercive and unilateral measures on vulnerable groups \r\nin society.\r\nMr. Alarsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, I would like to welcome \r\nMr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the friendly nation of Cuba. I would like to \r\nrenew the support of the Syrian Arab Republic for the \r\nCuban Government and people as they confront the \r\ndecades-long unjust embargo by the United States. We \r\nalso congratulate Cuba on the significant diplomatic \r\nvictory achieved today, which reflects the international \r\ncommunity’s rejection of the injustice that Cuba has \r\nsuffered for over 50 years.\r\nMy delegation would like to align itself with the \r\nstatements delivered by the representative of the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela on behalf of the \r\nMovement of Non-Aligned Countries and by the \r\nrepesentative of Thailand on behalf of the Group of \r\n77 and China (see A/71/PV.32). We wish to present the \r\nfollowing explanation of vote in our national capacity.\r\nIn our discussions of the unjust policies of various \r\ninfluential countries in the world, the decades-long \r\nUnited States embargo against Cuba continues to be a \r\nblatant example of an ongoing trend in United States \r\nforeign policy that is based on imposing embargoes, \r\npunishment and unilateral measures against countries \r\nthat refuse to follow and submit to United States \r\npolicies, and that simply wish to live in dignity and \r\nfreedom and have their independence and national \r\nsovereignty respected. \r\nAlthough the General Assembly has been meeting \r\nin this Hall for over half a century to stress, with an \r\noverall majority, that it rejects the United States embargo \r\nimposed against the Cuban people for that same period, \r\nthe United States has continued to challenge the will of \r\nthe international community and to violate the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, international law, human rights \r\nlaw and international humanitarian law. It also violates \r\nthe basic principles of international relations that are \r\nbased on respect for sovereignty and non-interference \r\nin the affairs of others, as well as respect for national \r\nstability and well-being. The international community \r\nhas welcomed the new policy of the current United \r\nStates Administration towards Cuba in the belief \r\nthat the policy will put an end to the unjust embargo \r\nimposed against the Cuban people.\r\nFollowing the visit of the United States President to \r\nCuba, and the warm welcome he received, it seemed that \r\nthis painful chapter of Cuban history would be closed. \r\nNo one expected that the United States embargo and \r\nunilateral coercive measures against the Cuban people \r\nwould continue, with new sanctions implemented \r\nagainst companies with a history of dealings with \r\nCuban individuals and institutions conducting legal, \r\nbanking, industrial and commercial operations pursuant \r\nto international trade laws and rules.\r\nOut of principle, my country rejects unilateral \r\nmeasures imposed by any country, whether economic, \r\ncommercial or financial, that undermine a country’s \r\nsovereignty, impair its decision-making ability and \r\nforce it to take specific actions or change its policies. \r\nSuch unilateral measures constitute collective \r\npunishment of an entire population. They undermine \r\nthe United Nations system and impede international \r\ntrade operations and the enjoyment of human rights. \r\nIt is now urgent for the Governments of countries that \r\nimpose unilateral economic measures to realize that \r\nsuch measures actually increase anti-West sentiment \r\nand provide extremists and terrorists with a new \r\nweapon to influence vulnerable groups in society that \r\nare targeted by illegal unilateral measures. This in turn \r\nthreatens international peace and security.\r\nBased on those facts, the Syrian Arab Republic \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 71/5, together with 190 \r\nother nations. The country that imposed this unjust \r\nembargo against the Cuban people abstained, as did \r\nthe delegation of the Israeli occupation, which was not \r\nsurprising, for it has voted against this resolution for \r\n25 years. This demonstrates yet again that it respects \r\nneither international law nor the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions nor the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMy country calls on the General Assembly to take \r\nthe necessary measures, based on the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, to end the aggressive \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.33\r\n16-34442 3/10\r\npractices, embargoes and unilateral economic \r\nmeasures imposed against some countries. We also \r\ncall for international efforts to be stepped up with a \r\nview to exposing the impact of such coercive unilateral \r\nmeasures, which are based on the use of force and \r\nhegemony to subjugate others.\r\nWe call for the lifting of the embargo imposed \r\nby the United States against Cuba and for an end to \r\nthe unilateral measures imposed by the United States, \r\nmembers of the European Union and other countries \r\nagainst the Syrian Arab Republic. These aggressive \r\ncoercive measures prevent the Syrian people from \r\naccessing basic services such as nutrition, health care, \r\neducation, medical supplies, fuel, and agricultural and \r\nindustrial items, as well as spare parts for civil aviation \r\nand telecommunications equipment. They violate \r\nthe rights of the Syrian people and they damage our \r\neconomy and efforts to combat terrorism.\r\nOne question remains unanswered: how can the \r\nUnited States, the countries of the European Union and \r\nothers reconcile the statements they deliver here and \r\nin other forums — about democracy, human rights and \r\nsutainable development — with policies that are based \r\non the oppression of peoples and the exploitation of \r\ntheir economic, humanitarian and social situations, or \r\nthat give a free pass to those who support terrorists?\r\nMr. Dibaei (Islamic Republic of Iran): Today the \r\nGeneral Assembly once again expressed its support for \r\nand solidarity with the Government and the people of \r\nCuba through a decisive vote in favour of resolution \r\n71/5, which calls for the lifting of the United States \r\nembargo against Cuba. One hundred and ninety-one \r\nMember States, including the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, voted in favour of the resolution. The adoption of \r\nAssembly resolutions on this topic, with such a wide \r\nrange of support and over the course of so many years, \r\nclearly indicates the strong objection of the international \r\ncommunity to unilateral economic coercive measures \r\nin general and the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba in particular.\r\nIt is also a sign of increasing sympathy with the \r\naspiration of the Government and the people of Cuba \r\nto end this unlawful and inhumane embargo. The \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo on Cuba, \r\nwhich has lasted for decades, serves no purpose other \r\nthan inflicting tremendous hardship and suffering on \r\nthe people of Cuba, especially women and children. \r\nThe embargo has seriously jeopardized the legitimate \r\nrights and interests of Cuba and other States, as well \r\nas freedom of trade and navigation. It therefore must \r\nbe lifted immediately, as requested by all the relevant \r\nresolutions of the General Assembly.\r\nDifferences and problems among countries should \r\nbe resolved through peaceful means and dialogue on the \r\nbasis of equality and mutual respect for the sovereignty \r\nof Member States. The Government of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran reiterates its strong belief that the \r\neconomic, commerical and financial embargo against \r\nCuba runs counter to the principles of international law \r\nthat govern relations among States and contradicts the \r\nletter and spirit of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nwhich calls for the promotion of solidarity, cooperation \r\nand friendly relations among nations.\r\nSuch measures continue to adversely affect the \r\nliving conditions and human rights of the Cuban people \r\nand will hamper the efforts of the Government of Cuba \r\nto achieve the internationally agreed development \r\ngoals, including the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nIn that context, the embargo continues to constrain the \r\nefforts of the Government and the people of Cuba to \r\neradicate poverty and hunger and to promote health \r\nand education, which are indispensable means for the \r\nachievement of economic and social development.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran remains opposed to the \r\napplication of unilateral economic and trade measures \r\nby the United States against other countries, blocking \r\nthe f low of people, trade and finance. We are also \r\nopposed to the extraterritorial application and effects \r\nof such national legislation on the sovereignty of other \r\nStates. The sanctions are contrary to the principles \r\nof international law, the sovereign equality of States, \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of States and \r\npeaceful coexistence among States.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, which has iself \r\nexperienced economic coercive measures, shares the \r\nconcern of the Government and the people of Cuba, and \r\ntherefore emphasizes with the urgent need to put an end \r\nto such measures and fully implement the contents of \r\nresolution 71/5, adopted today.\r\nMr. Gumende (Mozambique): Mozambique would \r\nlike to associate itself with all those countries that \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 71/5, as it ref lects the \r\nunconditional and overwhelming support and solidarity \r\nof the international community to the cause of the \r\npeople of Cuba.\r\nA/71/PV.33 26/10/2016\r\n4/10 16-34442\r\nBy advocating the end of the blockade against \r\nCuba, Mozambique reaffirms its compliance with the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, as well \r\nas the implementation of internationally agreed relevant \r\nprovisions, including resolution 70/5, adopted during \r\nthe Assembly’s seventieth session. In that context, \r\nMozambique affirms that it has never promulgated, \r\napplied or contributed to the application of any of \r\nthe laws or regulations mentioned in the Assembly’s \r\nresolutions on this issue.\r\nMozambique welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba. The re-opening of the diplomatic \r\nembassies of the two countries and the visit of \r\nPresident Obama to Cuba are among the positive steps \r\ntaken towards the normalization of bilateral relations. \r\nMozambique commends those steps and wishes to \r\nencourage further progress towards the goals and \r\naspirations that the voting pattern in this Hall every \r\nyear clearly reflects. The result of the voting we have \r\njust witnessed represents an important milestone.\r\nIt is crucial to remove the existing economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba to allow \r\nthe country to promote its national development more \r\nforcefully in this critical period of the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich advocates that we should leave no one behind in \r\npursuing this noble goal.\r\nNotwithstanding the enormous economic and \r\nsocial challenges arising from the blockade, Cuba \r\nhas played a principled role as a relevant development \r\npartner in the context of South-South cooperation and \r\nsolidarity, a role that is worthy of our continuous praise. \r\nIndeed, in the framework of the implementation of our \r\nnational development agenda, Cuba has always been a \r\nreliable cooperation partner, mainly in Mozambique’s \r\nsocial sectors such as education and health, alongside \r\nother important bilateral and multilateral development \r\npartners, whose valuable support we cherish and \r\ngreatly appreciate.\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating the support \r\nof Mozambique to the cause of the people of Cuba \r\nin their quest to secure the lifting of the economic \r\nblockade, which is long overdue.\r\nMr. Mendoza-García (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My country associates itself with the \r\nstatement made on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, \r\nand with the statement made by the representative of \r\nthe Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates (see A/71/PV.32). We would also like to share \r\nsome considerations in our national capacity.\r\nCosta Rica welcomes the re-establishment of \r\ndiplomatic relations between the United States of \r\nAmerica and Cuba. We highlight the March visit of the \r\nPresident of the United States to Cuba, the first in 88 \r\nyears, as a significant step towards improved and full \r\nbilateral relations. We applaud the measures announced \r\nby high-level officials of both countries with regard to \r\npolitical dialogue and openness in several mutually \r\nbeneficial areas, with positive implications for the well-\r\nbeing of the Cuban people.\r\nToday we welcome the new United States position \r\nof abstaining in the voting on resolution 71/5, newly \r\nadopted. \r\nIn fully keeping with international law and the \r\nprinciples undergirding the Charter of the United \r\nNations, Costa Rica reiterates its firm opposition to the \r\ncurrent policy of economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba, particularly through \r\nthe Helms-Burton Act, which is a true obstacle to \r\ninternational trade. My delegation stresses that, in line \r\nwith the core position of our foreign policy, it entirely \r\nrejects unilateral and extraterritorial measures, applied \r\nby any State against any other, and carried out by the \r\nimposition of laws and regulations on third parties.\r\nThe official visit of Costa Rica’s delegation to \r\nCuba in December 2015 consolidated the process \r\nof formalizing diplomatic relations between the \r\ntwo nations and enabled bilateral trade and greater \r\ncooperation in work of mutual interest, such as higher \r\neducation, technical and scientific cooperation and \r\nexchange, health, high-performance sports and foreign \r\ntrade. The Costa Rican agency in charge of promoting \r\nforeign trade signed a cooperation agreement with \r\nProCuba that supports the rapprochement of our \r\ncountries, helps diversify foreign trade and promotes \r\nforeign investment.\r\nOur times call for tearing down obstacles that \r\nseparate nations and generate artificial divisions \r\nbetween peoples. The exchange and development of \r\nmutual knowledge of our realities and dreams will \r\ngive way to greater respect and solidarity among all \r\nhuman beings.\r\nFor many decades now, the embargo imposed \r\nagainst Cuba has stood out as a tool of an outdated past \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.33\r\n16-34442 5/10\r\nthat must be replaced by fraternal engagement among \r\nnations in all areas of economic, social, technological \r\nand political cooperation within the framework of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In that \r\nconnection, I will end with the words of the President of \r\nthe Republic, Luis Guillermo Solís Rivera, pronounced \r\nduring the general debate at the current session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly:\r\n“we reiterate our support for the lifting of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade \r\nagainst Cuba in accordance with the systematic, \r\nalmost unanimous, demands of the international \r\ncommunity to that end.” (A/71/PV.10, p.18)\r\nMr. Lucas (Angola): The Angolan delegation aligns \r\nitself with the statements of the representatives of the \r\nNiger, Thailand and Venezuela on behalf, respectively, \r\nof the Group of African States, the Group of 77 and \r\nChina and the Non-Aligned Movement  (see A/71/\r\nPV.32).\r\nAllow me to begin by extending a warm welcome \r\nto Mr. Bruno Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of Cuba, and congratulating Cuba on the \r\nadoption of draft resolution 71/5, on the necessity of \r\nending the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba. \r\nThat adoption reflects the widespread support of the \r\ninternational community for the Cuban people.\r\nAngola reiterates its appreciation for the \r\nnormalization of diplomatic relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States. We also welcome President \r\nBarack Obama’s historic visit to Cuba this year, in the \r\nexpectation that it will be a tangible step towards the \r\nlifting of the embargo against Cuba. However, despite \r\nthe encouraging steps taken by the President of the \r\nUnited States to normalize relations between the two \r\ncountries, outstanding barriers remain. The resolution \r\nadopted today is relevant. Angola therefore voted \r\nin favour of it, as did the vast majority of the United \r\nNations membership.\r\nThe persistence of the economic, commercial \r\nand financial measures imposed by the United States \r\nagainst Cuba is a cause for concern. We expect that \r\nthe resumption of diplomatic relations between the two \r\ncountries will prompt the United States authorities to \r\ncontinue to take measures aimed at completely ending \r\nthe embargo, in line with the principles of mutual respect \r\nand respect for the Cuban people to freely exercise the \r\nright to choose their political and economic systems.\r\nWe regret that, despite the executive measures \r\nadopted by the President of the United States and his \r\nAdministration, the embargo remains in force as an \r\nobstacle to the full normalization of relations between \r\nthe two nations. We are particularly concerned about \r\nthe persistent extraterritorial nature of the embargo, \r\nnotably in the banking and financial areas. As clearly \r\nillustrated by Foreign Minister Rodríguez Parrilla in his \r\nstatement this morning (see A/71/PV.32), the embargo \r\nhas exacted an immense human and financial toll on \r\nthe Cuban people. According to conservative estimates \r\nby Cuban authorities, between March 2015 and March \r\n2016, the cost to Cuba of sanctions amounted to over \r\n$4 billion. In that context, Angola reiterates the urgent \r\nneed to lift the economic, commercial and financial \r\nrestrictions imposed by the United States against Cuba, \r\nwhich constitute a major obstacle to Cuba’s economic, \r\ntrade and financial relations with the United States and \r\nthe rest of the world and prevent the Cuban people from \r\ndeveloping their full potential.\r\nAngola reaffirms its commitment to respecting, \r\npreserving and promoting the principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and provisions of international \r\nlaw, as they constitute the basis of multilateralism in \r\nthe collective effort to maintain international peace \r\nand security, further social and economic development \r\nand promote respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. Angola commends, and once again \r\nencourages, the efforts of the Secretary-General to put \r\nan end to the embargo, which has been in force for over \r\n50 years.\r\nAngola reiterates its unconditional support for \r\nthe implementation of the provisions set out in the \r\nresolution adopted today, and takes this opportunity \r\nto appeal once again to the international community to \r\nredouble efforts to promot constructive and transparent \r\ndialogue between the two countries and achieve the \r\nobjectives of the resolution. \r\nFinally, Angola commends the position adopted by \r\nthe United States delegation in abstaining in the voting \r\ntoday, and strongly encourages the United States and \r\nCuba to pursue dialogue and build a relationshipbased \r\non mutual trust.\r\nMs. King (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines aligns itself with the \r\nstatements delivered today on behalf of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, the Non-Aligned Movement, the Group of \r\nA/71/PV.33 26/10/2016\r\n6/10 16-34442\r\n77 and China, and the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States (see A/71/PV.32).\r\nWhen President Obama elaborated his normalization \r\nprocess, most of the world had already determined that \r\nthe policy of the United States in relation to Cuba had \r\nfailed. Indeed, it was viewed globally as a ridiculous \r\nanachronism, a relic of the Cold War and the cause \r\nof an untenable, unnecessary and undesirable fissure \r\nin the hemispheric family. While Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines certainly welcomes the steps taken to \r\ndate by the Obama Administration, it is nevertheless \r\nmindful that the economic, commercial and financial \r\nblockade remains in place.\r\nMy delegation takes the f loor today to reiterate \r\nthat the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nconstitutes the greatest obstacle to the development \r\nof the full potential of the Cuban economy and \r\nthe well-being of its people. Saint Vincent and the \r\nGrenadines continues to believe that this blockade is \r\nmorally unsustainable.\r\nOpposition to that inhumane policy is now almost \r\nuniversal. In this very Hall, just over one year ago, the \r\ninternational community adopted the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, which sets Goals to guide \r\nthe creation of the future we want and aims at leaving \r\nno one behind. \r\nThe stirring and inspiring words of President \r\nBarack Obama in his inaugural address to the General \r\nAssembly in 2009 remain relevant and bear repeating \r\nagain and again. He said then: \r\n“The choice is ours ... we can be a generation that \r\nchooses to see the shoreline beyond the rough \r\nwaters ahead, that comes together to serve the \r\ncommon interests of human beings, and finally \r\ngives meaning to the promise embedded in the name \r\ngiven to this institution — the United Nations.” \r\n(A/64/PV. 3, p. 11)\r\nDuring his final address to the United Nations \r\nas President of the United States, President Obama \r\nrejected the notion that the future favoured the strong. \r\nHe believes Governments serve people, not the other \r\nway around. We know that citizens across the United \r\nStates are joining the international community by \r\nincreasingly voicing their disapproval and calling for \r\nthe lifting of the unilateral sanctions.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines agrees with \r\nPresident Obama that we have made strides to better \r\nalign our actions with our ideas. In that connection, \r\nwe recognize and commend the decision of the United \r\nStates to abstain in the voting today. However, we \r\nbelieve that President Obama possesses executive \r\npowers that will allow him to further modify the \r\nregulations governing the blockade. Let us look to the \r\nfuture, keep pace with the times and heed the insistent \r\nand consistent voice of the international community. \r\nResolution 71/5 is a matter of moral rectitude and of the \r\nwell-being of approximately 12 million Cubans.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines enthusiastically \r\nvoted in favour of resolution 71/5. We believe in change, \r\nand are encouraged by the abstention of the United \r\nStates today. We live in renewed hope that next year \r\nthere will be no need for us to vote on this resolution \r\nyet again.\r\nMr. Habib (Indonesia): Indonesia associates itself \r\nwith the statements delivered earlier on behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries and the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (see A/71/PV.32).\r\nIn the past year there have been positive \r\ndevelopments between Cuba and the United States in \r\nrelation to the embargo imposed in 1961. Some of the \r\nhighlights include the restoration of diplomatic relations \r\nbetween Cuba and the United States and the first visit \r\nby a United States President to Cuba. At about this \r\ntime last year, the international community adopted the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is \r\npremised on the commitment to leave no one behind. \r\nWe hope that those events can serve as a foundation on \r\nwhich to build cooperation between the two countries \r\nand bring about inclusive and sustainable development.\r\nNevertheless, the long-standing embargo has \r\nremained, and therefore is still a concern here at the \r\nUnited Nations. The embargo has created endless \r\neconomic and social hardship and suffering for the \r\npeople of Cuba, especially for vulnerable groups, such \r\nas children and women. The blockade is also one of \r\nthe main factors preventing Cuba from developing the \r\nfull potential of its economy, while at the same time it \r\nhas sapped Cuba’s ability to promote the welfare of the \r\nCuban people.\r\nFurthermore, Indonesia believes that the \r\nimposition of an economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo against Cuba contradicts the main principles \r\nof international law, including the principles of the \r\nsovereign equality of States and of non-intervention \r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.33\r\n16-34442 7/10\r\nand non-interference in another’s domestic affairs. It \r\nalso runs counter to international humanitarian law, \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the norms and \r\nprinciples governing peaceful relations among States. \r\nMore important, the application of the embargo goes \r\nagainst the spirit of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the commitment to leave no \r\none behind.\r\nWhile welcoming the initial steps in the \r\nnormalization of bilateral relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States, including the United States \r\nPresident’s expression of willingness to work towards \r\nthe lifting of the blockade, Indonesia believes that \r\nmore needs to be done. In particular, steps should be \r\ntaken to accelerate the process of repealing the laws \r\nand regulations that allow the United States embargo \r\nto take place.\r\nBearing in mind the considerations I mentioned, \r\nand fully taking into account Indonesia’s cordial ties \r\nwith, and strong support for, the Government and the \r\npeople of Cuba, and of the United States, Indonesia \r\nwould like to join other States Members of the United \r\nNations in calling for the immediate cessation of the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nby the United States of America against Cuba. Indonesia \r\ntherefore supported the adoption of the resolution 71/5.\r\nMr. Boukadoum (Algeria): We have heard so \r\nmany voices from all over the world stating once again \r\ntheir firm stand against the continuation of the unjust \r\neconomic, commercial and financial embargo imposed \r\nunilaterally on Cuba for more than half a century. \r\nToday there is almost unanimity among Member States \r\nin unequivocally calling for the lifting of the embargo. \r\nAlgeria considers Cuba more than just a friend that \r\nstood by it in dire times. Cuban doctors have shown their \r\ncommitment and expertise well beyond their borders \r\nand, most recently, were at the forefront in fighting the \r\nEbola virus epidemic. They did so on behalf of and for \r\nthe sake of the whole international community, with no \r\npayback whatsoever.\r\n Let me also state that we welcomed wholeheartedly \r\nthe resumption of diplomatic relations between the \r\nUnited States of America and Cuba, and we likewise \r\nfollowed the bold decisions taken by President Obama \r\nbefore, during and after his trip to Cuba. \r\nToday’s abstention in the voting by the United \r\nStates is extremely reassuring and positive. A few \r\nsteps are left to complete this historic effort — the total \r\nlifting of the embargo for the sake of the Cuban and the \r\nAmerican peoples, but also for the sake of the whole \r\nworld and the new opportunities that would thereby \r\nbe opened.\r\nIn that regard, I sincerely commend Mr. Bruno \r\nRodríguez Parrilla for this ground-breaking success. \r\nBut I also want to stress the very encouraging and \r\npromising stand expressed by Ambassador Samantha \r\nPower on today’s outcome (see A/71/PV.32). It is a \r\nsuccess for everyone. Seldom do we have such near \r\nunanimity on any text in the United Nations. It is a \r\nvictory for Cuba, but also for the United States — and, \r\nbeyond that, for multilateralism.\r\nAlgeria is proud to have participated for years now \r\nin the formation of this consensus. May it be a good \r\nomen for other conflicting issues at the United Nations.\r\nMr. Zamora Rivas (El Salvador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nEl Salvador aligns itself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe representative of the Dominican Republic on behalf \r\nof the Community of Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates and the statement delivered by the representative \r\nof Thailand on behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see \r\nA/71/PV.32).\r\nThe Government of El Salvador sees the outcome \r\nof the voting this morning as positive. No country in \r\nthe world expressed its opposition. This is a historic \r\nmilestone in international politics. For that reason, we \r\nwelcome this step forward, which we hope will lead to \r\nthe total lifting of the embargo against Cuba as quickly \r\nas possible. Today the Government of Cuba can now say \r\nto its people and to all peoples that no Government in the \r\nworld supports the embargo, including the Government \r\nthat had initiated it. That is a huge achievement.\r\nEl Salvador respects the purposes and principles \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and notes \r\nthat they continue to be valid and must be respected by \r\nall Member States in the process of the changes we have \r\ninitiated. The President of my own country, Salvador \r\nSánchez Cerén, stated at the seventy-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly:\r\n“In the Americas, we have noted with \r\nsatisfaction the progress made by Cuba and the \r\nUnited States in restoring their relations. However, \r\nwe believe that this change will not bring the \r\nexpected benefits to the people of both countries \r\nA/71/PV.33 26/10/2016\r\n8/10 16-34442\r\nif the economic embargo is not brought to an end.” \r\n(A/71/PV.14, p.11)\r\nEl Salvador commends the efforts made in the \r\ncontext of restoring diplomatic ties between the two \r\ncountries, including the reopening of embassies, \r\nthe visit to Cuba by President Obama in March, the \r\nresumption of regular ties between the two countries, \r\nthe adoption of measures on the use of the United States \r\ndollar in international transactions and the amendments \r\nenacted by the Department of the Treasury and the \r\nDepartment of Commerce of the United States to some \r\nof the regulations governing the embargo. However, \r\nalthough these measures constitute welcome steps, \r\nthey are limited and modify only some aspects of the \r\nembargo.\r\nThe opening of the relationship between the two \r\ncountries is a clear anomoly for the international \r\ncommunity. However, the opening of international \r\nrelations means the recognition of each other’s \r\nsovereignty, signifying friendship between them. That \r\nis incompatible with one of those countries continuing \r\nan embargo against the other, causing unnecessary  and \r\nunjust difficulties and distress for the people.\r\nI think it worth pointing out that, despite \r\nthese measures, Cuba, through perseverance and \r\ndetermination, has been able to overcome in an \r\nexemplary manner the obstacles and adversities \r\nstanding in its way. El Salvador applauds the progress \r\nthat Cuba has made in strengthening its economy \r\nand improving its productive processes. Under the \r\nblockade, the effects on the Cuban people in the areas \r\nof nutrition, health and education are glaringly obvious. \r\nAt the same time, Cuba continues to be prevented from \r\nfreely exporting and importing products and services \r\nto and from the United States. It cannot have direct \r\nbanking relationships with this country, nor can it \r\nreceive United States investment in other sectors of \r\nthe economy, apart from the telecommunications \r\nsector. The upsurge of the embargo is reflected in the \r\nimposition of fines running into the millions of dollars \r\nmeted out against banks and financial institutions that \r\nmaintain links with Cuba, as well as in the bias against \r\ninternational financial transactions that include Cuba.\r\nEl Salvador calls for a complete end to the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo that persists against \r\nCuba, because not only is it unjust and illegal, but it \r\nalso lacks the international community’s support. In \r\nthat regard, El Salvador reiterates the importance of \r\ncompliance with the provisions of resolution 47/19, \r\nadopted on 24 November 1992, and compliance with \r\nall the subsequent relevant resolutions adopted by the \r\nAssembly year after year, up to the present, that have \r\nemphasized the necessity of ending this embargo.\r\nFinally, the Government of El Salvador reiterates \r\nthe three aspirations that are cherished not just by \r\nthe Cuban people, but also by our own peoples and \r\nGovernments. First, the Government of the United \r\nStates will unilaterally lift the embargo. Secondly, \r\ndialogue between Cuba and the United States will \r\ncontinue. Thirdly, after so many years, all the peoples \r\nof the Americas, without exception, will be able to sit \r\nat the same table.\r\nMr. Raja Zaib Shah (Malaysia): Malaysia aligns \r\nitself with the statements delivered by representatives \r\non behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned Countries, \r\nthe Group of 77 and China, the Organization of Islamic \r\nCooperation, and the Association of the Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (see A/71/PV.32).\r\nThe General Assembly has consistently adopted \r\nthe draft resolution on this subject by an overwhelming \r\nmajority since it was first submitted in 1992. For \r\nmore than 24 years, the Assembly has demanded an \r\nunconditional lifting of the embargo that has caused \r\nenormous suffering and untold hardship for the Cuban \r\npeople. The nearly unanimous recorded vote this year \r\nclearly demonstrates the concerted international stand \r\nof 191 countries with Cuba on the annual draft resolution \r\ncalling for an immediate end to the embargo against \r\nthat country. The unilateral action in question runs \r\ncounter to the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. The General Assembly has always \r\nreiterated its rejection of coercive measures that could \r\nadversely affect the socioeconomic development of \r\ndeveloping countries. The continued existence of the \r\nembargo undermines multilateralism and the credibility \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nadopted by the General Assembly in 2015, includes \r\na paragraph urging Member States to refrain from \r\napplying unilateral financial and commercial measures \r\nthat run counter to the principles of the United Nations \r\nand international law, especially to developing \r\ncountries. An immediate end to the embargo is critical \r\nto improving the living standards of the Cuban people, \r\nparticularly in view of the 2030 Agenda theme of \r\nleaving no one behind.\r\n26/10/2016 A/71/PV.33\r\n16-34442 9/10\r\nMalaysia welcomes the restoration of diplomatic \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States and the \r\nlifting of restrictions on travel and remittances. We also \r\nwelcome the recent visit by President Obama to Cuba \r\nin March.\r\nMalaysia applauds the United States for its decision \r\ntoday to abstain in the voting on resolution 71/5, which \r\nis a step in the right direction. We acknowledge that \r\nmuch remains to be done. We encourage the United \r\nStates and Cuba to continue to engage in an open and \r\nconstructive dialogue, which must be conducted with \r\nmutual respect and without any preconditions.\r\nMalaysia firmly believes that the complete lifting \r\nof the embargo will not only significantly improve the \r\nquality of life and living standards of the Cuban people, \r\nbut will also contribute to peace, security and stability \r\nin the Americas.\r\nMr. Shaltut (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, my delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered on behalf of the groups to which we belong \r\n(see A/71/PV.32).\r\nMy delegation has taken note of the report of \r\nthe Secretary-General on the necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against Cuba \r\n(A/71/91), which was prepared pursuant to resolution \r\n70/5, adopted in 2015.\r\nMy country welcomes the improved relations \r\nbetween the United States of America and Cuba, as \r\nevidenced in particular by the visit of President Barack \r\nObama to Cuba in March and the steps taken by the \r\nUnited States Administration to amend several aspects \r\nof the embargo against Cuba, which we consider a step \r\nin the right direction. We are hopeful that further steps \r\nand measures will be taken with a view to lifting the \r\nembargo completely.\r\nIn line with the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international human rights law, Libya has never \r\nimplemented any of the laws or measures referred to in \r\nparagraphs 2 and 3 of resolution 71/5. My country fully \r\nbelieves that the only way to settle differences between \r\ncountries is through peaceful means and that imposing \r\nunilateral measures against countries runs contrary to \r\nthe Charter and the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights. Such measures constitute an obstacle to, and \r\ndisrupt the process of, the development and prosperity \r\nof nations. They stand in the way of achieving the \r\nSustainable Development Goals, which the General \r\nAssembly adopted unanimously one year ago.\r\nFor all of those reasons, my country voted in favour \r\nof the resolution 70/5. We believe that such unilateral \r\nmeasures must not be reproduced in the future.\r\nMs. Scott (Namibia): Namibia would like to \r\njoin other delegations in congratulating the Cuban \r\ndelegation on the vote.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representatives of Venezuela on behalf of \r\nthe Non-Aligned Movement (NAM), of the Niger on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States, and of Thailand \r\non behalf of the Group of 77 and China (see A/71/\r\nPV.32).\r\nWe would like to take this opportunity to commend \r\nCuba for its humanitarian and other assistance to many \r\ndeveloping countries, including Haiti and Namibia. \r\nNamibia thanks the Secretary-General for his report \r\n(A/71/91) on the implementation of resolution 70/5.We \r\nwant to say that we indeed welcome the statement made \r\nthis morning by the representative of the United States \r\nof America (see A/71/PV.32)\r\nThe title of this agenda item — “Necessity of ending \r\nthe economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nimposed by the United States of America against \r\nCuba” — says it all. Other words related to “necessity” \r\ninclude “inevitable”, “obligation” and “stipulation”. \r\nAs was highlighted in the statement made on behalf of \r\nNAM, the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba is contrary to international law and the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. It is disheartening that, \r\nafter 54 years, the embargo policy against Cuba has yet \r\nto end.\r\nNamibia understands that the United States holds \r\nthe law in the highest regard. We need therefore to \r\nask that country, following the visit in March by His \r\nExcellency Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates: was the international community remiss in \r\nbelieving that this senseless embargo would have been \r\nlifted by now? Namibia was hopeful when Cuba was \r\nremoved from the list of State sponsors of terrorism, \r\non which Cuba should have never been placed in the \r\nfirst place. \r\nYet the embargo remains very much in place, as the \r\nSecretary-General’s report indicates. The report also \r\nstates clearly that, despite a number of amendments to \r\nregulations that keep the policy in place, the economic \r\nA/71/PV.33 26/10/2016\r\n10/10 16-34442\r\nhardship imposed by the United States has not come \r\nto an end. The report states, on page 27, that financial \r\nand extraterritorial aspects of the embargo have been \r\nfurther intensified under the Trading with the Enemy \r\nAct of 1917.\r\nBased on the logic of law, it is not understandable or \r\nlogical that the United States should continue to regard \r\nCuba as an enemy. Furthermore, it is not clear why the \r\nblockade against Cuba was further strengthened through \r\nthe imposition of fines, in excess of $13.2 billion, on \r\nthose entities having relations with Cuba.\r\nThe establishment of diplomatic relations is an \r\nimportant first step towards the normalization of \r\nrelations between Cuba and the United States. We have \r\nbeen greatly encouraged by recent diplomatic talks and \r\nby the policies of rapprochement adopted by the United \r\nStates with regard to Cuba. We would also encourage \r\ndetermined progress towards the further easing of \r\nthe remaining restrictions in the areas of travel and \r\ntelecommunications, as well as remittances.\r\nNamibia urges the Government of the United \r\nStates of America to fully normalize relations with \r\nthe Republic of Cuba by lifting all unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures, not only owing to their illegality but also \r\nbecause of humanitarian considerations. We look \r\nforward to the ending of the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 39.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 4.10 p.m.\r\n"
