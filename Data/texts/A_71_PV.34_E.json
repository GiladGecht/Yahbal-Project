"United Nations A/71/PV.34\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n34th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 27 October 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 70\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/71/4)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/339)\r\nThe President: I welcome The Honourable Judge \r\nRonny Abraham, President of the International Court \r\nof Justice, to the General Assembly. \r\nBefore we turn to the report of the Court (A/71/4), \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to make a few \r\nremarks about the role of the Court in international \r\nrelations and in furthering our goal of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes.\r\nIn April, the international community celebrated, \r\nin The Hague, the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations and the tireless custodian \r\nof the international legal order. Over the past seven \r\ndecades, the success of the Court as an impartial arbiter \r\nhas been proven time and again, as the confidence of \r\nthe international community in the Court’s capacity to \r\ndeliver justice has grown. More and more States have \r\nsought resolution of their disputes through the decisions \r\nof the International Court of Justice. It is clear that the \r\nexistence of the Court and its ability to deliver justice \r\nfor all have shaped the course of history.\r\nWe can ask ourselves how many conflicts, how \r\nmany fatalities and how much human suffering have \r\nbeen avoided thanks to the availability of the Court to \r\npeacefully settle States’ international disputes. We can \r\nreflect as well on how much the rule of law has been \r\nstrengthened internationally thanks to the authority of \r\nthe Court’s judgments. Moreover, it would be impossible \r\nto measure how many international, national and \r\nsub-national authorities have drawn inspiration from \r\ninternational law, based upon the Court’s judgments \r\nand advisory opinions. \r\nWhat we know is that the International Court of \r\nJustice is an indispensable part of the United Nations \r\nsystem and its ability to maintain international peace \r\nand security. This landmark anniversary year calls on \r\nall of us to reflect on the Court’s critical role. Let us \r\ntherefore take this opportunity to reaffirm our steadfast \r\nsupport for the Court and its jurisdiction.\r\nLet me express my appreciation to the President \r\nof the International Court of Justice for the work of \r\nthe Court.\r\nIt is now my honour to invite Judge Ronny Abraham, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, to take \r\nthe f loor.\r\nJudge Abraham, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice (spoke in French): I would like to \r\nthank the General Assembly for continuing the practice \r\nof allowing the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice to present the activity of the Court over the past \r\nyear, a practice that reflects the Assembly’s interest in \r\nand support for the Court.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

I wish you every success in \r\ndischarging that distinguished role.\r\nBetween 1 August 2015 — the starting date of the \r\nperiod covered by the Court’s report (A/71/4) — and \r\ntoday, up to 15 contentious cases have been pending \r\nbefore the Court, and hearings have been held in seven \r\nof them. The Court first heard the oral arguments \r\nof the parties on the preliminary objections raised \r\nby the respondent in the cases Alleged Violations \r\nof Sovereign Rights and Maritime Spaces in the \r\nCaribbean Sea (Nicaragua v. Colombia) and Question \r\nof the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between \r\nNicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 nautical miles \r\nfrom the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua v. Colombia). It \r\nthen held hearings on the questions of jurisdiction and \r\nadmissibility raised in the cases Obligations concerning \r\nNegotiations relating to Cessation of the Nuclear Arms \r\nRace and to Nuclear Disarmament (Marshall Islands \r\nv. India), (Marshall Islands v. Pakistan) and (Marshall \r\nIslands v. United Kingdom). The Court also heard oral \r\narguments from the parties, a few weeks ago, on the \r\npreliminary objections raised by Kenya in the case \r\nMaritime Delimitation in the Indian Ocean (Somalia \r\nv. Kenya). That case is currently under deliberation. \r\nFinally, last week, between 17 and 19 October, the Court \r\nheld hearings on a petition for provisional measures \r\nsubmitted to it by Equatorial Guinea on 13 June 2016, \r\nin the case Immunities and Criminal Proceedings \r\n(Equatorial Guinea v. France). The Court will shortly \r\nrender its decision on that petition.\r\nSince 1 August 2015, the Court has also rendered \r\nseven judgments. One contemplated the merits of the \r\njoined cases Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua \r\nin the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and \r\nConstruction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San \r\nJuan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), and the other six \r\nsettled preliminary questions relating to the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court and the admissibility of certain claims.\r\nLastly, it should be noted that the Court also \r\ndecided, for the first time in many years, to solicit \r\nan expert opinion in one of the cases pending before \r\nit — the case Maritime Delimitation in the Caribbean \r\nSea and the Pacific Ocean (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua). It \r\ndid so by issuing an order to that effect on 31 May 2016.\r\nI shall now give a brief account of the substance of \r\nthose decisions. \r\nFirst, I shall address certain aspects of the judgment \r\nrendered on the merits of the claims of Costa Rica and \r\nNicaragua in the two joined cases Certain Activities \r\ncarried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa \r\nRica v. Nicaragua) and Construction of a Road in \r\nCosta Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua v. \r\nCosta Rica), respectively.\r\nIn its 16 December 2015 judgment, the Court first \r\nheard the first of those two cases. I would recall that \r\nthe proceedings were instituted in late 2010 by Costa \r\nRica, which complained in particular that Nicaragua \r\nhad invaded and occupied what it claimed to be Costa \r\nRican territory; that it had dug a channel, also known \r\nas a “caño” thereon; that it had conducted a number \r\nof works, notably dredging in the San Juan River, in \r\nviolation of its international obligations; that it had \r\nbreached the provisional measures indicated by the \r\nCourt in the case in 2011 and 2013; and, finally, that it \r\nhad breached Costa Rica’s navigation rights on the San \r\nJuan River.\r\nIn order to settle the dispute before it, the Court \r\nfirst dealt with the question of which of the two States \r\nhad sovereignty over the disputed territory. To do so, \r\nthe Court considered the Treaty of Limits by which the \r\nParties had fixed the course of their land boundary in \r\n1858, as well as a number of arbitral awards in which \r\ntwo arbitrators had given their interpretation of certain \r\ndisputed points in relation to the Treaty of Limits.\r\nThe Court concluded from its analysis of those \r\ninstruments that sovereignty over the territory in \r\ndispute in the case belonged to Costa Rica. It therefore \r\nfound that the activities carried out by Nicaragua in \r\nthat territory since 2010 were in breach of Costa Rica’s \r\nterritorial sovereignty and that Nicaragua was obliged \r\nto make reparation for the damage caused.\r\nThe Court then turned to the question of whether, \r\nthrough its activities on its own territory, in particular in \r\nthe San Juan River, Nicaragua had violated obligations \r\nincumbent upon it under international environmental \r\nlaw. It considered first the question of compliance \r\nwith procedural obligations that had allegedly been \r\nbreached, those obligations being of both a customary \r\nand a conventional nature. The Court found that the \r\nactivities carried out by Nicaragua were not such as to \r\ngive rise to a risk of significant transboundary harm \r\nand that the respondent was thus not under an obligation \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 3/25\r\nto carry out an environmental impact assessment, or to \r\nnotify and consult with the applicant in that regard.\r\nThe Court further stated that it was not convinced \r\nthat Nicaragua had breached any obligation to notify \r\nand consult contained in international conventions, \r\nas was alleged by Costa Rica in the case. It therefore \r\nconcluded that Nicaragua had not violated any \r\nprocedural obligations. Secondly, with respect to \r\nsubstantive obligations, the Court concluded that the \r\navailable evidence did not show that Nicaragua had \r\ncaused prejudice to the territory of Costa Rica or \r\nbreached its obligations concerning the prevention of \r\ntransboundary harm by engaging in dredging activities \r\nin the lower San Juan River.\r\nThe Court continued its analysis by examining \r\nwhether Nicaragua had breached its obligations under \r\nthe orders handed down in the same case indicating \r\nprovisional measures. Indeed, by an order of 8 March \r\n2011, the Court had ordered a number of provisional \r\nmeasures in that case, the binding nature of which was \r\nnot in dispute. I would recall that the Court stated in \r\nits LaGrand (Germany v. United States of America) \r\njudgment, rendered on 27 June 2001, that such \r\nmeasures are binding on the parties. On the basis of \r\nthe facts presented to it, which were uncontested by the \r\nparties, the Court found that Nicaragua had breached \r\nits obligations under the 2011 order.\r\nThe Court next addressed Costa Rica’s allegations \r\nthat Nicaragua had committed a number of breaches of \r\nits navigational rights on the San Juan River. Finding that \r\nNicaragua had not provided a convincing justification \r\nfor the conduct of its authorities in incidents concerning \r\nnavigation on the San Juan River by inhabitants of the \r\nCosta Rican bank of the river, the Court concluded \r\nthat Nicaragua had breached Costa Rica’s navigational \r\nrights on the San Juan River pursuant to the 1858 Treaty \r\nof Limits.\r\nConcerning the reparation requested by Costa \r\nRica, the Court held that the declaration that Nicaragua \r\nhad breached the territorial sovereignty of Costa Rica \r\nby excavating three caños and establishing a military \r\npresence in the disputed territory provided adequate \r\nsatisfaction for the non-material injury suffered on \r\nthat account; the same applied to the declaration of \r\nthe breach of the obligations under the Court’s order \r\nof 8 March 2011 on provisional measures, and to the \r\ndeclaration of the breach of Costa Rica’s navigational \r\nrights.\r\nThe Court further considered that Costa Rica \r\nwas entitled to receive compensation for the material \r\ndamage caused by Nicaraguan breaches. It stated \r\nthat the parties should engage in negotiation in order \r\nto reach an agreement on the compensation issues. \r\nHowever, the Court specified that if the parties failed to \r\nreach such an agreement within 12 months of the date \r\nof its judgment, it would itself, at the request of either \r\nparty, determine the amount of compensation.\r\nHaving examined the case of Certain Activities \r\ncarried out by Nicaragua in the Border Area (Costa \r\nRica v. Nicaragua), the Court turned secondly to the \r\nmatters in dispute in the case of Construction of a Road \r\nin Costa Rica along the San Juan River (Nicaragua \r\nv. Costa Rica). I would recall in that respect that the \r\nproceedings had been instituted by Nicaragua against \r\nCosta Rica on 22 December 2011, the applicant alleging \r\n“violations of Nicaraguan sovereignty and major \r\nenvironmental damages to its territory”. Nicaragua \r\ncontended, in particular, that Costa Rica was carrying \r\nout major road construction works in the border area \r\nbetween the two countries, along the San Juan River, \r\nin breach of a number of international obligations and \r\nwith grave environmental consequences for Nicaragua.\r\nThe Court therefore examined whether Costa Rica \r\nhad breached obligations of a procedural or substantive \r\nnature in respect of environmental protection. With \r\nregard to the procedural obligations, the Court first \r\nconsidered the alleged breach of the obligation to carry \r\nout an environmental impact assessment. It found that \r\nthe road construction project undertaken by Costa Rica \r\ncarried a risk of significant transboundary harm. It \r\ntherefore concluded that the threshold for triggering \r\nthe obligation to evaluate the environmental impact \r\nof the road project had been met. Finding also that \r\nCosta Rica had, in any event, not shown the claimed \r\nexistence of an emergency that would, in its view, have \r\njustified constructing the road without undertaking an \r\nenvironmental impact assessment, the Court considered \r\nwhether Costa Rica had complied, in the circumstances \r\nof the case, with its obligation to carry out such an \r\nassessment.\r\nIt observed that that obligation required an ex ante \r\nevaluation of the risk of significant transboundary \r\nharm — that is to say, before the implementation of \r\nthe project — whereas the studies carried out by Costa \r\nRica were post hoc assessments that evaluated the \r\nenvironmental impact of stretches of the road already \r\nbuilt, and not the risk of future harm. The Court thus \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n4/25 16-34541\r\nconcluded that Costa Rica had not complied with its \r\nobligation under general international law to carry out \r\nan environmental impact assessment concerning the \r\nconstruction of the road. In view of that conclusion, the \r\nCourt considered that it need not determine whether \r\nCosta Rica was required under general international law \r\nto notify and consult with Nicaragua, prior to carrying \r\nout the work. It also found that it was not established \r\nthat Costa Rica had violated any obligation to notify or \r\nconsult pursuant to the treaties invoked by Nicaragua.\r\nThe Court went on to consider the alleged breaches \r\nof substantive obligations incumbent upon Costa \r\nRica under international environmental law. After \r\nexamining the relevant evidence, the Court found \r\nthat Nicaragua had not proved that the construction of \r\nthe road had caused significant transboundary harm \r\nand therefore rejected Nicaragua’s claim that Costa \r\nRica had violated its substantive obligations under \r\ncommon international law regarding transboundary \r\nharm. The Court also rejected the rest of Nicaragua’s \r\nsubmissions concerning Costa Rica’s alleged violations \r\nof substantive obligations contained in various treaties, \r\nNicaragua having failed to demonstrate that Costa Rica \r\nhad disregarded the texts in question.\r\nLastly, the Court considered Nicaragua’s claim that \r\nthe dumping of sediment caused by the construction \r\nof the road and the creation of sediment deltas in the \r\nriver constituted a violation of its territorial integrity \r\nand sovereignty over the San Juan river. It found that \r\nclaim unconvincing, observing that Costa Rica did \r\nnot exercise any authority on Nicaragua’s territory, \r\nincluding the river, and did not carry out any activity \r\nthereon. It therefore dismissed Nicaragua’s claim in \r\nthat regard.\r\nWith regard to the reparations requested by \r\nNicaragua, the Court concluded that a declaration of \r\nwrongful conduct in respect of Costa Rica’s violation \r\nof the obligation to conduct an environmental impact \r\nassessment was an appropriate measure of satisfaction.\r\nAs I mentioned in my introduction, during the period \r\nunder review the Court also delivered six judgments on \r\npreliminary questions relating either to jurisdiction or \r\nadmissibility. On 24 September 2015, it handed down a \r\njudgment by which it rejected the preliminary objection \r\nto jurisdiction raised by Chile in the case concerning \r\nan Obligation to Negotiate Access to the Pacific Ocean \r\n(Bolivia v. Chile). Having presented that judgment in \r\nthe statement that I had the honour to make last year to \r\nthe Assembly (see A/70/PV.47), I shall not go back over \r\nthat decision.\r\nI will therefore begin by recalling certain elements \r\nof the judgments rendered by the Court on 17 March \r\n2016 in two cases brought by Nicaragua against \r\nColombia, namely, the case concerning the Question \r\nof the Delimitation of the Continental Shelf between \r\nNicaragua and Colombia beyond 200 nautical miles \r\nfrom the Nicaraguan Coast (Nicaragua v. Colombia) \r\nand that concerning Alleged Violations of Sovereign \r\nRights and Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea \r\n(Nicaragua v. Colombia). \r\nThe first of those two cases was introduced in \r\nSeptember 2013 regarding a dispute concerning the \r\ndelimitation of, on the one hand, the continental \r\nshelf of Nicaragua extending beyond — according \r\nto Nicaragua — the 200-nautical-mile limit from the \r\nbaselines from which the breadth of the territorial sea \r\nof Nicaragua is measured, and on the other hand, the \r\ncontinental shelf of Colombia.\r\nColombia then raised preliminary objections. \r\nThe first concerned the Court’s jurisdiction ratione \r\ntemporis. Indeed, in its application, Nicaragua sought \r\nto found the Court’s jurisdiction in article XXXI of \r\nthe American Treaty on Pacific Settlement, signed \r\non 30 April 1948, also known as the Pact of Bogota. \r\nHowever, having denounced that instrument on \r\n27 November 2012, Colombia maintained the Court \r\nhad no jurisdiction since the proceedings had been \r\ninstituted on 16 September 2013. \r\nIn its judgment, the Court recalled that the date \r\nat which its jurisdiction has to be established is the \r\ndate on which the application is filed. Under the terms \r\nof article XXXI of the Pact of Bogota, the parties \r\nrecognize as compulsory the jurisdiction of the Court \r\n“as long as the ... Treaty remains in force”. The first \r\nparagraph of article LVI of the Treaty provides that, \r\nfollowing denunciation of the Pact by a State party, the \r\nTreaty shall remain in force between the denouncing \r\nState party and other parties for a period of one year \r\nfollowing the notification of denunciation. \r\nThe Court noted Nicaragua’s application had been \r\nfiled after Colombia had given notice of denunciation \r\nbut before the expiration of the one-year period referred \r\nto in the first paragraph of article LVI. The only question \r\nraised by Colombia’s first preliminary objection was \r\nwhether an a contrario interpretation could be applied \r\nto the second paragraph of article LVI, which states that\r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 5/25\r\n“The denunciation shall have no effect with \r\nrespect to ongoing procedures initiated prior to the \r\ntransmission of the particular notification.”\r\nAn affirmative response to that question would have \r\nallowed the Court to declare that it lacked jurisdiction \r\nin respect of the proceedings, even if the proceedings \r\nhad been instituted while the Treaty was still in force \r\nbetween the parties. After examining the provisions \r\nof the Treaty, the Court answered the above question \r\nin the negative. It therefore rejected Colombia’s first \r\npreliminary objection.\r\nThe Court also considered two further objections \r\nto jurisdiction, both of which were rejected. It found \r\nthat, contrary to Colombia’s assertions, it had not \r\ntaken a decision on whether or not Nicaragua had an \r\nentitlement to a continental shelf beyond 200 nautical \r\nmiles from its coast in its 2012 judgment between \r\nthe same parties, and that, consequently, it was not \r\nprecluded, by the res judicata principle, from ruling on \r\nthe application submitted by Nicaragua in September \r\n2013. The Court also took the view that, Nicaragua was \r\nnot requesting the Court to revise the 2012 judgment, \r\nnor was it framing its application as an appeal against \r\nthat judgment, as Colombia had argued.\r\nThe Court further ruled concerning the request \r\non the admissibility of Nicaragua’s requests. \r\nColombia first asserted that Nicaragua’s request \r\nregarding the delineation of the maritime boundary \r\nbetween Nicaragua and Colombia in the areas of the \r\ncontinental shelf which appertain to each of them, \r\nbeyond the boundaries determined by the Court in \r\nits 2012 judgment, was inadmissible owing to the \r\nfact that Nicaragua had not secured the requisite \r\nrecommendation on the establishment of the outer \r\nlimits of its continental shelf from the Commission on \r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf.\r\nThe Court considered that, since delimitation of \r\nthe continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles can \r\nbe undertaken independently from a recommendation \r\nfrom the Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf, that recommendation is not a prerequisite for a \r\nState party to the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea asking the Court to settle a dispute \r\nwith another State over such a delimitation. It therefore \r\nrejected the objection.\r\nColombia then argued that Nicaragua’s request —\r\nwhereby it asked the Court to establish the principles \r\nand rules of international law determining the rights \r\nand duties of the two States in the continental shelf area \r\nwhere their claims overlap, pending the delimitation \r\nof the maritime boundary of the parties beyond 200 \r\nnautical miles from the Nicaraguan coast — concerned \r\na non-existent dispute and was inadmissible. The Court \r\nobserved that the request did not involve an actual \r\ndispute between the parties, nor did it specify what \r\nexactly the Court was being asked to decide. It therefore \r\nupheld Colombia’s objection.\r\nThe proceedings on the merits have therefore been \r\nresumed, and the Court, by an order of 28 April 2016, \r\nfixed the dates for the filing of a memorial by Nicaragua \r\nand a counter-memorial by Colombia on the questions \r\nraised by the first request put forward by Nicaragua in \r\nits application.\r\nAs I have said, the Court delivered a second \r\njudgment on 17 March 2016 — the same day — in the \r\ncase concerning Alleged Violations of Sovereign Rights \r\nand Maritime Spaces in the Caribbean Sea (Nicaragua \r\nv. Colombia). In that case, Nicaragua’s application was \r\nfiled on 26 November 2013 relating to\r\n“a dispute concern[ing] the violations of Nicaragua’s \r\nsovereign rights and maritime zones declared by \r\nthe Court’s judgment of 19 November 2012 [in \r\nthe case concerning the Territorial and Maritime \r\nDispute (Nicaragua v. Colombia)] and the threat of \r\nthe use of force by Colombia in order to implement \r\nthese violations”. \r\nColombia raised preliminary objections, the \r\nfirst which is that raised in the case I just described, \r\nrelated to the Court’s jurisdiction ratione temporis. The \r\nobjection was rejected for the same reason that I set \r\nout earlier.\r\nIn its second objection, Colombia argued that \r\nthe Court did not have jurisdiction, because there \r\nwas no dispute between the parties on the date that \r\nthe application was filed. The Court recalled in that \r\nconnection that Nicaragua was formulating two distinct \r\nclaims, one, that Colombia had violated Nicaragua’s \r\nsovereign rights and its maritime zones, and the other, \r\nthat Colombia had breached its obligation not to use or \r\nthreaten to use force. \r\nAfter examining the evidence submitted to it, \r\nthe Court found that at the time of the filing of the \r\napplication, there did indeed exist a dispute concerning \r\nthe alleged violations by Colombia of Nicaragua’s rights \r\nin the maritime zones, which, according to Nicaragua, \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n6/25 16-34541\r\nthe Court declared in its 2012 judgment to appertain to \r\nNicaragua. The Court thus rejected the objection raised \r\nby Colombia regarding the absence of a dispute in \r\nrespect of that claim. By contrast, the Court considered \r\nthat on the date of the filing of the application there was \r\nno dispute concerning Nicaragua’s second claim, and \r\nit therefore upheld the objection raised by Colombia in \r\nthat regard.\r\nIn its third objection, Colombia contended that the \r\nCourt lacked competence under the Pact of Bogota, \r\nbecause at the time of the filing of the application, the \r\nparties were not of the opinion that the purported dispute \r\ncould not be settled by direct negotiations through the \r\nusual diplomatic channels. However, having examined \r\nthe evidence, the Court concluded that at the date of \r\nNicaragua’s filing of the application, neither party \r\ncould plausibly maintain that the dispute between them \r\ncould be settled by direct negotiations. Colombia’s \r\nthird preliminary objection was thus rejected, as was its \r\nfifth, according to which the Court had no jurisdiction \r\nwith regard to compliance with a prior judgment. The \r\nCourt observed that the objection rested in the premise \r\nthat the Court was being asked to enforce its 2012 \r\njudgment. However, it noted Nicaragua does not seek \r\nto enforce the 2012 judgment as such.\r\nFinally, the Court did not have to rule upon the \r\nfourth objection, which concerned another basis for \r\ncompetence invoked by Nicaragua as an alternative \r\nground, the examination of which was unnecessary. \r\nSo the proceedings on the merits have been resumed in \r\nrespect of the first claim put forward by Nicaragua in \r\nits applications, and the Court, by an order of 17 March \r\n2016, fixed the time limit for the filing of a counter-\r\nmemorial by Colombia.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI shall now briefly present the three judgments \r\nrendered by the Court on 5 October in the cases of \r\nObligations concerning Negotiations relating to \r\nCessation of the Nuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear \r\nDisarmament (Marshall Islands v. India, Marshall \r\nIslands v. Pakistan and Marshall Islands v. United \r\nKingdom). I will do so in the other official language of \r\nthe Court.\r\nI would recall that on 24 April 2014, the Marshall \r\nIslands filed in the Registry of the Court applications \r\ninstituting proceedings against India, Pakistan and the \r\nUnited Kingdom, alleging the failure of those States \r\nto fulfil their obligations concerning negotiations \r\nrelating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race and \r\nto nuclear disarmament. The respondents subsequently \r\nraised preliminary objections to the jurisdiction of \r\nthe Court and to the admissibility of the applications, \r\narguing, in particular, that the Court lacked jurisdiction \r\non the grounds that there was no dispute between the \r\nparties at the time that the applications were filed. In its \r\njudgments the Court began by examining that objection.\r\nThe Court observed that the existence of a dispute \r\nbetween the parties was a condition of its jurisdiction. \r\nIn order for a dispute to exist, it must be shown that \r\nthe claim of one party is positively opposed by \r\nthe other; the two sides must hold clearly opposite \r\nviews concerning the question of the performance or \r\nnon-performance of certain international obligations. \r\nIn order to demonstrate that, the evidence must show \r\nthat the respondent was aware, or could not have been \r\nunaware, that its views were positively opposed by the \r\napplicant. Those conditions must in principle be met \r\non the date of the filing of the application; although \r\nthe parties’ conduct during the proceedings may be \r\nrelevant for various purposes — notably in clarifying \r\nthe subject matter of the dispute — it is not sufficient to \r\nestablish the existence of a dispute between them.\r\nIn its judgments, the Court considered whether, as \r\nthe Marshall Islands claimed, statements made by the \r\nrespondents in multilateral forums before the date of the \r\nfiling of the applications could lead to the conclusion \r\nthat there was a dispute between the applicant and \r\neach respondent. The Court concluded in the three \r\ncases that, on the basis of those statements — whether \r\ntaken individually or together — it could not be said \r\nthat the respondents were aware, or could not have \r\nbeen unaware; that the Marshall Islands was making an \r\nallegation that they were in breach of their obligations. \r\nThose statements were thus insufficient to bring \r\ninto existence a legal dispute between the parties. \r\nIt also found that, in that context, the conduct of the \r\nrespondents did not allow for the conclusion that a \r\ndispute existed.\r\nLastly, I would mention one final aspect of those \r\ndecisions that is of particular interest. In its judgments, \r\nthe Court stated that considerable care was required \r\nbefore inferring, from votes cast on resolutions before \r\npolitical organs, such as the General Assembly, \r\nconclusions as to the existence or not of a legal \r\ndispute on some issue covered by those resolutions. \r\nThe wording of a resolution and the votes or patterns \r\nof voting on resolutions on the same subject matter \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 7/25\r\nmay constitute relevant evidence of the existence of \r\na dispute in some circumstances, particularly where \r\nstatements were made by way of explanation of vote. \r\nHowever, some resolutions contain a large number of \r\ndifferent propositions; a State’s vote on such resolutions \r\ncannot by itself be taken as indicative of the position \r\nof that State on each and every proposition within that \r\nresolution, let alone of the existence of a legal dispute \r\nbetween that State and another State regarding one of \r\nthose propositions.\r\nThe Court concluded in all three judgments that the \r\nobjection to jurisdiction raised by the respondents and \r\nbased on the absence of a dispute between the parties \r\nhad to be upheld. It therefore found no need to consider \r\nthe other objections raised by the respondents. Since \r\nthe Court lacked jurisdiction, it could not proceed to \r\nthe merits of the cases.\r\nI have, then, described the substance of the \r\njudgments rendered by the Court during the past year. \r\nBefore outlining the new cases brought before it in the \r\ncourse of the same period, I shall briefly discuss the \r\norder dated 31 May 2016, whereby the Court decided \r\nto arrange for an expert opinion in the case concerning \r\nmaritime delimitation in the Caribbean Sea and the \r\nPacific Ocean, Costa Rica v. Nicaragua. \r\nIn that case, the Court was of the view that there \r\nwere certain factual matters relating to the state of the \r\ncoast between the point suggested by Costa Rica and \r\nthe point suggested by Nicaragua in their pleadings \r\nas the starting point of their maritime boundary in the \r\nCaribbean Sea that could be relevant for the purpose of \r\nsettling the dispute submitted to the Court. The Court \r\nconsidered that with regard to such matters it would \r\nbenefit from an expert opinion. Two geomorphology \r\nexperts have therefore been appointed to conduct two \r\nsite visits and draw up a report that will be communicated \r\nto the Court and the parties before hearings are held in \r\nthe case. I should point out that this is only the second \r\ntime that the Court has decided to apply Article 50 of \r\nits Statute, according to which it “may, at any time, \r\nentrust any individual, body, bureau, commission, or \r\nother organization that it may select, with the task of \r\ncarrying out an enquiry or giving an expert opinion.”\r\nWhile in the past the Court has often considered \r\nexpert reports or even heard from such experts, in most \r\ncases the experts have been presented by the parties \r\nthemselves, either as members of their delegations or as \r\nindependent experts. This time, however, the Court’s \r\ndecision to arrange for an expert opinion at its own \r\nrequest has obliged it to ask the General Assembly for an \r\nadditional budget in order to cover the extra costs. I am \r\nsure that it can count on the Assembly’s understanding \r\nand support in that regard. The Court has deemed the \r\nexpert opinion in question to be essential to its sound \r\nadministration of justice, in this instance its sovereign \r\nexercise of its responsibilities under the Statute. \r\nAlthough the additional $12,000 is relatively modest, \r\nit cannot be absorbed by the Court’s current budget, \r\nwhich is 10 per cent lower than the appropriations for \r\nthe biennium 2014-2015.\r\nI come now to the new cases brought before the \r\nCourt. \r\nOn 6 June, the Republic of Chile instituted \r\nproceedings against the Plurinational State of Bolivia \r\nwith regard to a dispute over the status and use of the \r\nwaters of the Silala. Chile alleges that the Silala is an \r\ninternational watercourse that f lows between the two \r\nStates but that status has been disputed by Bolivia \r\nsince 1999, claiming the Silala’s waters as exclusively \r\nBolivian. According to the application, the dispute \r\nbetween the two States therefore concerns the nature of \r\nthe Silala as a watercourse and the resulting rights and \r\nobligations of the parties under international law. By \r\nan order dated 1 July, the Court fixed 3 July 2017 and \r\n3 July 2018 as the respective time limits for the filing of \r\na memorial by Chile and a counter-memorial by Bolivia.\r\nOn 13 June 2016, the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea instituted proceedings against France with \r\nregard to immunities and criminal proceedings. \r\nEquatorial Guinea contends, among other things, that \r\nby initiating criminal proceedings against its Second \r\nVice-President in charge of Defence and State Security \r\nand by ordering the legal attachment of a building said \r\nto house Equatorial Guinea’s embassy, France has \r\ndisregarded immunities accorded under international \r\nlaw and has violated Equatorial Guinea’s sovereignty. \r\nBy an order dated 1 July, the Court fixed 3 January \r\n2017 and 3 July 2017 as the respective time limits for \r\nthe filing of a memorial by the Republic of Equatorial \r\nGuinea and a counter-memorial by the French Republic. \r\nOn 29 September, Equatorial Guinea filed a request \r\nfor the indication of provisional measures in the case, \r\ncontending that the pursuit of criminal proceedings in \r\nFrance against the Vice-President and the property of \r\nEquatorial Guinea and France’s refusal to respect the \r\nbuilding located at 42 avenue Foch in Paris as premises \r\nof Equatorial Guinea’s diplomatic mission in France \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n8/25 16-34541\r\ncreated a real and imminent risk of irreparable prejudice \r\nto the rights of Equatorial Guinea. As I mentioned \r\nearlier, hearings on the request were held from 17 to \r\n19 October.\r\nLastly, on 14 June, the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\ninstituted proceedings against the United States \r\nof America with regard to a dispute concerning \r\ncertain Iranian assets, alleging in particular that the \r\nUnited States has adopted a number of legislative \r\nand executive acts that have the practical effect of \r\nsubjecting the assets and interests of Iran and Iranian \r\nentities, including those of the Central Bank of Iran, \r\nto enforcement proceedings, in breach of jurisdictional \r\nimmunities recognized by customary international \r\nlaw and by the provisions of the 1955 Treaty of Amity, \r\nEconomic Relations, and Consular Rights between Iran \r\nand the United States of America, which is binding \r\nbetween the parties. After consulting with the parties, \r\nthe Court fixed 1 February 2017 and 1 September 2017 \r\nas the respective time limits for the filing of a memorial \r\nby the Islamic Republic of Iran and a counter-memorial \r\nby the United States of America.\r\nThat brings to three the number of new cases \r\nsubmitted to the Court during the period under \r\nreview and to 11 the total number of cases currently \r\non the Court’s docket. The diversity and complexity \r\nof the cases that the Court has dealt with this year \r\nis emblematic of its activities in recent years. As my \r\nreport shows, the new cases filed earlier this year add \r\nto that diversity.\r\nMr. Braun (Germany), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThis year, the Court reached another milestone \r\nwhen it celebrated its seventieth anniversary in April. \r\nWe held a formal sitting in The Hague for the occasion \r\nand were honoured that it was attended by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral. On Monday I had the privilege of opening an \r\nexhibition entitled “70 Years in the Service of Peace \r\nand Justice”, organized at United Nations Headquarters \r\nfor the anniversary and open to visitors to this building.\r\nWhile we should celebrate the work that the Court \r\nhas accomplished over the past 70 years, we have not \r\nlost sight of the importance of continually reflecting \r\non the need to adapt the Court’s working methods in \r\norder to respond to the increase in its workload and the \r\ncomplexity of the cases submitted to it. I would like to \r\nassure the Assembly that the Court will continue to use \r\nall the resources at its disposal to fulfil its role as the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI would like to thank the Assembly once again for \r\ngiving me the opportunity to address it today, and I \r\nwish the Assembly every success in its seventy-first \r\nsession.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Khoshroo (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement attaches great \r\nimportance to agenda item 70, “Report of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice”, and takes note of the \r\nCourt’s report contained in document A/71/4 regarding \r\nthe activities of the Court between 1 August 2015 and \r\n31 July 2016, as requested by the decision of the General \r\nAssembly last year. \r\nI would also like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for his presentation of the \r\nreport to the Assembly.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms and \r\nunderscores its principled position concerning the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the non-use or threat \r\nof use of force. The International Court of Justice plays \r\na significant role in promoting and encouraging the \r\nsettlement of international disputes by peaceful means, \r\nas called for in the Charter of the United Nations, and \r\nit does so in such a manner that international peace and \r\nsecurity and justice are not endangered.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement endeavours to \r\ngenerate further progress to achieve full respect for \r\ninternational law and, in that connection, commends the \r\nrole of the International Court of Justice in promoting \r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes in \r\naccordance with the relevant provisions of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations — particularly Articles 33 and \r\n94 — and the Statute of the Court.\r\nWith regard to advisory opinions of the Court, \r\ngiven that the Security Council has not sought any \r\nadvisory opinion from the Court since 1970, NAM \r\nurges the Security Council to make greater use of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, as a source of advisory \r\nopinions on and interpretations of the relevant norms \r\nof international law and controversial issues. It further \r\nrequests the Council to use the Court as a source for \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 9/25\r\ninterpreting relevant international law and also urges \r\nthe Council to consider having its decisions be reviewed \r\nby the Court, bearing in mind the need to ensure their \r\nadherence to the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement also invites the \r\nGeneral Assembly, other organs of the United Nations \r\nand the specialized agencies to request advisory \r\nopinions of the International Court of Justice on legal \r\nquestions arising within the scope of their activities.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement reaffirms the \r\nimportance of the unanimous opinion issued by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice on 8 July 1996 on the \r\nLegality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. In that \r\ncase, the Court concluded that there exists an obligation \r\nto pursue in good faith and bring to a conclusion \r\nnegotiations leading to nuclear disarmament in all its \r\naspects under strict and effective international control.\r\nThe Non-Aligned Movement continues to call \r\non Israel, the occupying Power, to fully respect the \r\nInternational Court of Justice’s advisory opinion on the \r\nLegal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in \r\nthe Occupied Palestinian Territory, dated 9 July 2004. \r\nIt calls upon all States to respect and ensure the respect \r\nof the provisions therein for the realization of the end \r\nof the Israeli occupation, which began in 1967, and for \r\nthe independence of the State of Palestine with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital.\r\nMr. Joyini (South Africa): My delegation has the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the Group of African \r\nStates. \r\nThe African Group associates itself with the \r\nstatement just delivered by the representative of the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Non-Aligned \r\nMovement.\r\nAt the outset, the African Group would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Judge Ronny Abraham, for his presentation and \r\nalso for the report on the Court’s activities contained \r\nin document A/71/4. The African Group continues to \r\nconsider the International Court of Justice to be the \r\npre-eminent mechanism for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes at the international level.\r\nIt should be kept in mind that the Court, as a court \r\nof justice and the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, occupies a special position. Everything that \r\nthe Court does is aimed at promoting the rule of law. \r\nThe World Court hands down judgments and provides \r\nadvisory opinions in accordance with its Statute, which \r\nis an integral part of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nand thus contributes to promoting and clarifying \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe African Group welcomes the reaffirmed \r\nconfidence that States have shown in the Court’s \r\nability to resolve their disputes. In particular, we are \r\npleased to see that States continue to refer disputes \r\nto the International Court of Justice. We commend \r\nStates for no longer limiting their referral of cases to \r\nmatters of little political significance, as we now see \r\nthe Court deciding disputes involving weighty political \r\nissues. The number of cases currently pending on the \r\nInternational Court of Justice’s docket is a reflection of \r\nthe esteem in which States hold the Court.\r\nNotwithstanding the proliferation of international \r\njudicial dispute-settlement mechanisms on both a \r\nspecialized and a regional basis, the International Court \r\nof Justice continues to attract a wide range of cases, \r\ncovering many areas. While the Court’s determination \r\nof whether there exists an obligation to cooperate in a \r\nparticular case is based principally on treaty obligations, \r\nthe Court also clearly draws upon general principles, \r\nparticularly in making the link between procedural and \r\nsubstantive obligations.\r\nThe Court draws significantly on the principle of \r\nprevention, enunciated in its earlier decisions — notably \r\nthe Corfu Channel case and in the advisory opinion \r\non the threat or use of nuclear weapons. Therefore the \r\nAfrican Group reaffirms the importance of the Court’s \r\nunanimous advisory opinion issued on 8 July 1996 on \r\nthe Legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons. \r\nIn that decision, the Court concluded that there exists \r\nan obligation to pursue in good faith and bring to a \r\nconclusion negotiations leading to nuclear disarmament \r\nin all its aspects under strict and effective international \r\ncontrol. The Group of African States attaches great \r\nimportance to that matter because Africa is a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free zone. In that regard, it is interesting to note \r\nthat the current list of cases before the Court includes \r\ncases on the obligation to enter into negotiations \r\nrelating to the cessation of the nuclear arms race and to \r\nnuclear disarmament.\r\nFor example, by an order dated 19 June 2015, the \r\nInternational Court of Justice fixed a time limit for \r\nthe filing by the Republic of the Marshall Islands of \r\na recent statement of its observations and submissions \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n10/25 16-34541\r\non the preliminary objections raised by the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the \r\ncase. The Marshall Islands invoked breaches of article \r\nVI of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons (NPT) by the United Kingdom. Article VI \r\nof the NPT provides that each of the parties to the \r\nTreaty undertakes to pursue negotiations in good \r\nfaith on effective measures relating to the cessation of \r\nthe nuclear arms race at an early date and to nuclear \r\ndisarmament, and on a treaty on general and complete \r\ndisarmament under strict and effect international \r\ncontrol. The Marshall Islands contended that the United \r\nKingdom has breached and continues to breach its legal \r\nduty to fulfilling, in good faith, its obligations under \r\nthe NPT and customary international law.\r\nAccording to the Marshall Islands, the conduct \r\nof the respondent and its assertions of the legality of \r\nits behaviour, juxtaposed with the statements of the \r\nMarshall Islands containing a complaint aimed precisely \r\nat that conduct and the legal position of the United \r\nKingdom, demonstrate the existence of a dispute as to \r\nthe scope of and compliance with its obligations under \r\narticle VI of the NPT and the corresponding customary \r\ninternational law obligations. \r\nThe Court recalls that the question whether there is \r\na dispute in a particular contentious issue turns on the \r\nevidence of the opposition of views. In that regard, the \r\nconduct of a respondent can contribute to a finding by \r\nthe Court that the views of the parties are in opposition. \r\nHowever, as the Court has previously concluded, in the \r\npresent case, none of the statements that were made in a \r\nmultilateral context by the Marshall Islands offered any \r\nparticulars regarding the United Kingdom’s conduct. \r\nOn the basis of such statements, it cannot be said the \r\nUnited Kingdom was aware, or could not have been \r\nunaware, that the Marshall Islands was making an \r\nallegation that the United Kingdom was in breach of its \r\nobligations. In that context, the conduct of the United \r\nKingdom does not provide a basis for finding a dispute \r\nbetween the two States before the Court.\r\nThe Court therefore concludes that the first \r\npreliminary objection made by the United Kingdom \r\nmust be upheld. It follows that the Court does not \r\nhave jurisdiction under Article 36, paragraph 2, of its \r\nStatute. Consequently, it is not necessary for the Court \r\nto deal with the other objections raised by the United \r\nKingdom. For those reasons, the Court, by eight votes \r\nto eight, with the President casting a vote, upholds the \r\nfirst preliminary objection to jurisdiction raised by the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nbased on the absence of a dispute between the parties. \r\nBy nine votes to seven, the Court finds that it cannot \r\nproceed to the merits of the case.\r\nThe importance of advisory opinions on legal \r\nquestions referred to the International Court of Justice \r\ncannot be overstated in the pursuit of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes in accordance with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. It is therefore rather disappointing \r\nthat during the period under review, no requests for \r\nadvisory opinions were made.\r\nMr. Misztal (Poland): On behalf of the Visegrád \r\nGroup, consisting of the Czech Republic, Hungary, \r\nSlovakia and my own country, Poland, I would like to \r\nthank the President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nJudge Ronny Abraham, for presenting the Court’s \r\nreport for the 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016 period \r\n(A/71/4). I have the honour to present our Group’s \r\ncommon position with respect to the International \r\nCourt of Justice’s report.\r\nThe Visegrád Group supports the International \r\nCourt of Justice as the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations. We commend the Court for its role in \r\nthe peaceful settlement of international disputes and \r\nfor its contribution, by those means, to the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. The Court has \r\na unique role in the interpretation and application \r\nof public international law. The Visegrád Group \r\nacknowledges with appreciation that, by identifying \r\nthe norms of customary international law, the Court \r\nsignificantly contributes to the increased effectiveness \r\nof international law.\r\nThe Court is universal in its character, as all Member \r\nStates can be parties to cases before it. Furthermore, \r\nthe universality of the Court lies in its jurisdiction, \r\nwhich covers the whole field of international law. \r\nThe Court decides on cases concerning, among other \r\nthings, territorial and maritime disputes, environmental \r\ndamage and the conservation of living resources, the \r\nprosecution or extradition of former Heads of State, \r\nsovereign immunity and the use of force. In that \r\ncontext, we commend the broadening of the fields of \r\npublic international law that are touched upon by the \r\nCourt in its decisions.\r\nThe cases brought before the Court — although \r\nthe decisions are binding only on the parties to the \r\ndispute — are of great importance for the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. Every new judgment of the \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 11/25\r\nCourt marks another step towards the strengthening \r\nof the international legal order and the promotion of \r\nthe rule of law and friendly relations among States. \r\nWe also highly value the Court’s contribution to \r\nthe strengthening of the rule of law in international \r\nrelations through its advisory opinions.\r\nThe mission of the Court cannot be entirely fulfilled \r\nwithout the full commitment of all Member States to \r\ncomply with their obligations concerning the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. Respect for and compliance \r\nwith the Court’s decisions, both judgments and orders, \r\nare the fundamental prerequisite for the effectiveness \r\nof the system of international justice. The obligation \r\nof the parties to a dispute to implement in good faith \r\nthe Court’s decisions is crucial to the concept of the \r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes.\r\nWith regard to the issue of jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt, it is worth recalling that it can be conferred on \r\nthe Court not only by way of a unilateral declaration by \r\nStates but also through special agreements and treaties. \r\nSince the exercise of the Court’s jurisdiction is based \r\non the consent of States, it is important that States use \r\nthose ways to accept the Court’s jurisdiction. A case in \r\npoint is the International Agreement on Olive Oil and \r\nTable Olives, adopted in Geneva on 9 October 2015, \r\narticle 26 of which provides for the right of recourse \r\nto the Court by a member of the International Olive \r\nCouncil’s decision-making body.\r\nAs this is the first time that the Visegrád Group has \r\nspoken with one voice during the consideration of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice’s report in the General \r\nAssembly, I would like to ensure the Assembly of our \r\nGroup’s support for the Court and to express our best \r\nwishes to the Court in the accomplishment of its lofty \r\nmission in rendering justice and strengthening the role \r\nof international law in the world.\r\nMr. Dolphin (New Zealand): I have the honour \r\nto speak today on behalf of the group of countries \r\nconsisting of Australia, Canada and my own country, \r\nNew Zealand.\r\nOur group would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Mr. Ronny Abraham, for \r\nhis report on the work of the Court over the past year. \r\nAs countries that firmly believe in the rule of law and \r\nthe importance of a rules-based international system, \r\nour group continues to be a long-standing supporter of \r\nthe International Court of Justice.\r\nThe group recognizes the crucial role that the \r\nCourt plays as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. Our confidence in the Court is reflected in our \r\nacceptance of the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction. We \r\nfirmly believe that wider acceptance of the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court would enable it to fulfil its role \r\nmore effectively and to further encourage the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes. We therefore encourage Member \r\nStates that have not yet done so to accept the Court’s \r\ncompulsory jurisdiction.\r\nThe use of the Court as an organ for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes should not be understated. \r\nHowever, our group considers that the role of the Court \r\nas a tool in conflict prevention also needs to be further \r\nrecognized and explored. For example, there may be \r\nsituations where there is a legal element at the heart of \r\nescalating tensions between States. Guidance from the \r\nCourt might play a part in preventing those tensions \r\nfrom evolving into conflict.\r\nWe are aware that the Court’s caseload continues to \r\nbe demanding. While the Court has dealt with a number \r\nof complex cases in the past year, it maintains one of its \r\nlargest workloads for the year ahead. The willingness \r\nof States to turn to the Court must be welcomed, as \r\nit further highlights the important role that the Court \r\nplays in the promotion of the rule of law and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThe year 2016 also marks the seventieth anniversary \r\nof the Court’s inaugural sitting. We congratulate the \r\nCourt on its significant anniversary. The Canada-\r\nAustralia-New Zealand group of countries considers \r\nthat the Court remains as relevant today as it has ever \r\nbeen. As the number of international rules governing \r\nMember States’ interactions with one another increases, \r\nit is even more important for Member States to have \r\nrecourse to the Court as an effective protection to \r\nuphold the rule of law. Its role in providing transparent \r\nand impartial clarification on questions of international \r\nlaw for all Member States continues to be essential.\r\nWe look forward to continuing to support the Court \r\nin its contribution to the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nMr. Hamsa (Malaysia): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to express my delegation’s appreciation to \r\nMr. Ronny Abraham, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, for his presentation of the Court’s \r\ncomprehensive report on its judicial activities over the \r\npast year (A/71/4). We join others in expressing our \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n12/25 16-34541\r\nheartfelt congratulations to the Court in conjunction \r\nwith the seventieth anniversary of its inaugural sitting. \r\nAs the principle judicial organ of the United \r\nNations in adjudicating the peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes between States and in providing advisory \r\nopinions on questions of international law, the \r\nCourt plays an important role in the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security through its upholding \r\nof the rule of law. Since the Court’s creation, we have \r\nwitnessed a steady increase in the number of cases \r\nreferred to it, which show a varied geographical \r\ndistribution and cover a wide range of subjects. Those \r\ndevelopments are further testament to the faith and \r\nconfidence that the international community has in the \r\nCourt’s ability to fairly and impartially discharge its \r\nadjudicative functions.\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate that, as a \r\npeace-loving nation, Malaysia’s foreign policy is \r\npremised on the principle of the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes and the concept of moderation. Such an \r\napproach advocates mediation, arbitration, dialogue \r\nand negotiation. When dialogue or a negotiated \r\nsettlement fails, the International Court of Justice \r\nprovides the avenue for Member States to peacefully \r\nresolve their differences. It was due to that shared \r\ncommitment to the peaceful resolution of disputes \r\nand our full confidence in the International Court of \r\nJustice that Malaysia and its immediate neighbours \r\nagreed to submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt in two cases regarding disputes over sovereignty \r\nover certain maritime features. Our confidence in the \r\nimpartiality of the adjudication process is reflected by \r\nour fullest acceptance of, adherence to and respect for \r\nthe decisions of the Court.\r\nMalaysia firmly believes that the existence \r\nor possession of nuclear weapons is contrary to \r\ninternational law. For that reason, we supported \r\nresolution 49/75 K of 15 December 1994, in which the \r\nAssembly requested the Court to render an advisory \r\nopinion on the legality of the threat or use of nuclear \r\nweapons under international law. On 8 July 1996, the \r\nCourt recognized for the first time in history that the \r\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons is generally contrary \r\nto the principles and rules of international law. The \r\nCourt further unanimously declared in its opinion,\r\n“There exists an obligation to pursue in good \r\nfaith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading \r\nto nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under \r\nstrict and effective international control.”\r\nOn the occasion of the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthat advisory opinion in 2016, let us all once again \r\ndeclare our collective resolve to achieve a nuclear-\r\nweapon-free world for the sake of our generation and \r\nsucceeding generations. For my delegation’s part, we \r\nhope for greater support from the General Assembly in \r\ndue course for the Malaysia-sponsored draft resolution \r\nentitled, “Follow-up to the advisory opinion of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice on the legality of the \r\nthreat or use of nuclear weapons” (A/C.1/71/L.42), \r\nwhich we have had the honour to present annually in \r\nthe First Committee since that milestone of a legal \r\nopinion was rendered by the Court in 1996.\r\nIn a related matter, my delegation is closely following \r\nthe International Court of Justice cases Obligations \r\nconcerning Negotiations relating to Cessation of the \r\nNuclear Arms Race and to Nuclear Disarmament, \r\nwhich were filed by the Marshall Islands.\r\nThe question of Palestine remains a principal \r\nissue on the United Nations agenda. I wish to recall \r\nthe advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice of 9 July 2004 on the Legal Consequences of \r\nthe Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian \r\nTerritory, which found Israel’s continued occupation of \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory and its construction \r\nof the apartheid wall illegal under international law. \r\nMy delegation appeared before the Court to present our \r\narguments during the hearing on that case. However, \r\n12 years after that advisory opinion, we deeply regret \r\nthe continued refusal of Israel to accept the Court’s \r\nconclusion. We urge Israel to fulfil its obligation under \r\ninternational law and to make reparation for all damage \r\ncaused by the construction of the wall in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including in and around East \r\nJerusalem.\r\nThe Court is indispensable in a multilateral world \r\nthat is firmly established in a rules-based framework, \r\nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nMalaysia reiterates its full support for the Court’s work, \r\nand we take this opportunity to commend the judges \r\nand all members of the Court for their unwavering \r\ncommitment and sense of duty in upholding the law, \r\nwith a view to maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nMr. Tiriticco (Italy): I would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, Judge \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 13/25\r\nRonny Abraham, for his address today to the Assembly, \r\nwhich appropriately and effectively emphasized a \r\nnumber of important points.\r\nIn the light of the principles enshrined in its \r\nConstitution, and in view of the constitutive treaties of \r\nthe European Union, Italy considers that the option of \r\njudicial scrutiny of State activities is an indispensable \r\nelement of any system that is based on the rule of law. \r\nAt the international level, the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes is an obligation for States. Clearly set out in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, it is a core value \r\nof the international community, which decided to ban \r\nthe use of force. In that connection, providing judicial \r\nsettlement through the Court, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, is key.\r\nResorting to a judicial mechanism is a solid and \r\nserious option for States that believe in an international \r\ncommunity based on the rule of law. For that reason, \r\nfollowing a pledge made in 2012 at the high-level \r\nsummit on the rule of law, Italy accepted the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court under Article 36 of the Statute, \r\nand we encourage others to do the same. I am therefore \r\npleased to address the General Assembly for the first \r\ntime since our declaration entered into force. Italy \r\nconfirms the fundamental contribution that judicial \r\nreview brings to the stability of the international \r\ncommunity, where the rule of law provides the guiding \r\nblueprint in terms of both rights and obligations \r\nfor State membership. As the framework of the \r\ninternational community expands to include new actors \r\nand a progressively tightened network of relations, and \r\nas international law adjusts to new scenarios, we cannot \r\nfail to recognize the increasing call for the primacy of \r\na number of principles that should constitute the pillars \r\nof peace in this new mutating world order.\r\nIn that respect, we express our belief that the \r\ninalienable right to human dignity is one such \r\nfundamental principle that is emerging in international \r\nlaw. It draws its force not only by virtue of universality, \r\nbut also from the recognition given by States, whether \r\nconstitutionally enshrined or through consolidating \r\ndomestic jurisprudence. From that perspective, we wish \r\nto convey our vision that the international law system \r\nshould ensure its own effectiveness through a fair \r\nand balanced approach among the different principles \r\ngoverning the international community today.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): I would like to begin by thanking \r\nJudge Ronny Abraham, President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice, for his dedication and leadership, as \r\nwell as for the in-depth and comprehensive report of \r\nthe work of the Court (A/71/4). I also express my deep \r\nappreciation of and support for the achievements of the \r\nCourt during the reporting period.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe Court’s inaugural sitting. Japan commends the \r\nCourt for the important role it has played over the past \r\n70 years in the peaceful settlement of international \r\ndisputes and the promotion of the rule of law. As the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, the Court \r\nhas delivered many important judgments and advisory \r\nopinions since its creation and has taken on a diverse \r\nrange of cases that required complex legal examination. \r\nThe Court is faced with an increasing demand for legal \r\nsolutions and opinions on complex legal and factual \r\nquestions. We believe that, thanks to its devoted work \r\nand profound legal wisdom, the Court will continue to \r\ngain the respect and support of Member States.\r\nThe achievements of the Court over the past \r\nseven decades clearly demonstrate that its work has \r\nstrengthened the rule of law. The rule of law and the \r\npeaceful settlement of international disputes are a \r\nfundamental principle of Japan’s foreign policy, based \r\non our conviction that they provide the essential \r\nfoundation of any society.\r\nJapan shares the view expressed by President \r\nAbraham at the seminar held in April in The Hague \r\nto celebrate the anniversary of the Court’s seventieth \r\nsession, when he stated that the political and legal \r\nenvironment in which the Court operated had changed \r\nconsiderably over the years since 1945. Japan admires \r\nthe Court’s readiness to face the new challenges that \r\nmay arise in the coming decade, which was also \r\nexpressed in his speech.\r\nAt the same time, the international community \r\ntoday benefits not only from the Court’s wisdom, \r\nbut also from the remarkable development of various \r\npeaceful means of dispute settlements through other \r\norgans, such as the International Tribunal for the Law \r\nof the Sea and the Permanent Court of Arbitration. \r\nThe current trend whereby States have judicial options \r\nbased on the specific legal issues involved is a welcome \r\ndevelopment towards an appropriate division of labour. \r\nWe hope that the judgments of those organs collectively \r\nwill further develop and clarify international law.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming our support for \r\nthe work of the International Court of Justice. We have \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n14/25 16-34541\r\nconfidence in its professionalism and its dedication \r\nto strengthening international law and the rule of law \r\ngoing forward.\r\nMs. Orosan (Romania): On behalf of my delegation, \r\nlet me first express our thanks to the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for his presentation of the \r\nannual report (A/71/4), which gives us a clear picture of \r\nthe latest developments with regard to the cases on the \r\nCourt’s docket.\r\nThe year 2016 has been an anniversary year for the \r\nCourt, as the celebration of 70 years from its inaugural \r\nsitting took place earlier this year. We applaud this \r\nhistoric moment for the Court and congratulate the \r\nPresident, as well as the other members of the Court, \r\non the various activities that were organized on that \r\noccasion. We firmly believe that the rationale of the \r\nCourt — to promote the rule of law where diplomatic or \r\npolitical actions have failed to work — is as valid now \r\nas it was at the time of its establishment. The strongest \r\nargument is the current activity of the Court. The broad \r\ngeographical distribution of cases, the wide variety of \r\nsubject matter dealt with and the increasing number of \r\nStates that have decided to place their confidence in the \r\nCourt bear testimony to the fact that the Court has a \r\nrole to play in today’s world.\r\nPromoting and reinforcing the rule of law, \r\nespecially at a time when new challenges to the rule of \r\nlaw at the international level are witnessed, is of great \r\nimportance. From this perspective, we regret that the \r\nCourt’s budget has been reduced by comparison with \r\nprevious years. We hope that the financial situation of \r\nthe Court will improve in the next period and that the \r\nefficiency measures already undertaken by the Court \r\nwill have a positive impact.\r\nRomania is committed to the settlement of all \r\ndisputes by peaceful means and is a strong supporter \r\nof the Court as guarantor of the supremacy of law. The \r\nacceptance by Romania in 2015 of the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court confirms the full trust \r\nthat Romania places in the Court and its efforts to \r\nconsolidate the rule of law at the international level, as \r\nwell as the resolve of my country to solve any dispute \r\nexclusively by peaceful means and in accordance with \r\ninternational law.\r\nI wish to conclude by reiterating our conviction that \r\nin its future activity the Court will continue to uphold \r\nits standards of high professionalism and impartiality, \r\nand by expressing our hope that new States will accept \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nMr. Troncoso (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to state that we have \r\nfollowed with special attention and interest the work of \r\nthe International Court of Justice in the period covered \r\nin its report (A/71/4), presented by its President, \r\nMr. Ronny Abraham.\r\nThe report indicates that during that period \r\nthe Court carried out intense work. As noted in the \r\nreport, the issues brought before the Court are varied \r\nin nature and include such topics as the immunities \r\nof States and State authorities, the law of the sea, the \r\ndetermination and delimitation of maritime zones, \r\ninternational waterways, current international legal \r\ndisputes, the exercise of powers and rights in maritime \r\nareas, measures taken on property belonging to foreign \r\nStates, sources of international obligations and their \r\nvalidity over time, reparations, and the interpretation \r\nand application of international treaties, among others.\r\nAccording to the provisions of its Statute, the Court \r\nexercises jurisdiction in respect to the cases submitted \r\nto it, in terms expressly recognized by the States and \r\nin the framework of the principle of jurisdiction of a \r\nvoluntary nature. In exercising that jurisdiction, the \r\nCourt must apply international law as stipulated in \r\nArticle 38 of the Statute, which accords to treaties, \r\namong the sources of international law, the same status \r\nas the expression of the will of States, constituting a \r\nbasic pillar in the structure of international relations.\r\nAs we have remarked on many occasions, among \r\nthe central principles that guide the foreign policy of \r\nChile is the principle of the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes. Along with that, another central \r\nprinciple of Chile’s external actions is the essential \r\nrole of respect for international treaties, which are an \r\nexpression of the consent governed by international \r\nlaw. Their strict observance and stability over time \r\nconstitute prerequisites for the existence of peaceful \r\nrelations between nations.\r\nMy country is currently a party in two cases which \r\nhave been brought before the International Court of \r\nJustice and which require particular attention. We are \r\nparticipating in these cases reaffirm our commitment \r\nto international law and peaceful relations between \r\nStates. Chile has is fully confident in the application \r\nof international law in relations with other States. \r\nThis commitment requires everyone to respect the \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 15/25\r\nfundamental principles of coexistence and to refrain \r\nfrom engaging in conduct that impedes the normal \r\ndevelopment of these relations and undermines them \r\nto everyone’s detriment. This conduct is particularly \r\nrelevant in situations in which a specific case under \r\nconsideration by the International Court of Justice.\r\nMoreover, it should be recalled that, once a matter \r\nis referred to the Court, the Court is the only body \r\ncompetent to consider it. Therefore, it is unacceptable \r\nthat a matter which is already under consideration by \r\nthe Court should simultaneously be taken up in other \r\nbodies or forums of a political nature.\r\nConsistent with the role and competence of \r\nthe Court and the diverse range of its mission, my \r\ndelegation takes this opportunity to express its full \r\nsupport for the Court’s requirements in terms of \r\nproviding the necessary budgetary resources so that it \r\ncan efficiently discharge the lofty responsibilities that \r\nhave been vested in it. That is especially necessary at \r\ntimes when its jurisdictional activities are intense and \r\nit needs specialized staff and investment in technology. \r\nWe also support the Court’s approach, as outlined in \r\nits President’s report to the Assembly, with regard to \r\nthe dialogue that should exist between the Court and \r\nthe Assembly. That dialogue is indispensable for the \r\nAssembly to be able to adopt the most appropriate \r\ndecisions on the budget of the principal judicial organ \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nMr. Sharma (India): At the outset, 1 would like \r\nto thank Judge Ronny Abraham, President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, for his comprehensive \r\nreport on the judicial activities of the Court for the \r\nperiod from August 2015 to July 2016. 1 also thank him \r\nand Vice-President Judge Abdulqawi Ahmed Yusuf for \r\nguiding the work of the Court.\r\nThe Court, the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, celebrated its seventieth anniversary \r\non 20 April at The Hague. As we all know and as most \r\nof us witnessed, on Monday, 24 October, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the President of the Court inaugurated the \r\nUnited Nations exhibition organized by the International \r\nCourt of Justice, entitled “70 years in Service of Peace \r\nand Justice.”\r\nThe Court is entrusted with the task of the \r\npeaceful resolution of disputes between States, which \r\nis fundamental for the fulfilment of one of the purposes \r\nof the United Nations, namely, the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Since its first session \r\nin April 1946, the Court has been seized of more than \r\n160 cases. It has delivered over 120 judgements and 27 \r\nadvisory opinions. We acknowledge that the Court has \r\nfulfilled most admirably the task of settling disputes \r\nbetween States peacefully, and it has acquired the \r\nwell-deserved reputation of being an institution that \r\nmaintains the highest legal standards, in accordance \r\nwith its mandate under the Charter of the United \r\nNations and in accordance with its own Statute, which \r\nis an integral part of the Charter.\r\nOne of the primary goals of the United Nations, as \r\nstated in the Preamble to the Charter, is to establish \r\nconditions under which justice and respect for \r\ninternational obligations can be maintained. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice, as the only court with \r\ngeneral international law jurisdiction, is uniquely \r\nplaced to help achieve that goal.\r\nThe report of the Court illustrates the importance \r\nthat States attach to the Court and the confidence that \r\nthey place in it. The importance of the Court is evident \r\nfrom the number, nature and variety of cases it deals \r\nwith and, in so doing, its ability to deal with the complex \r\naspects of public international law. Furthermore, the \r\nuniversality of the Court is evident from the fact that \r\nStates from all continents have submitted cases to it \r\nfor adjudication.\r\nThe judgments delivered by the Court have \r\nplayed an important role in the interpretation and \r\nclarification of the rules of international law, as well \r\nas in the progressive development and codification of \r\ninternational law. In the performance of its judicial \r\nfunctions, the Court has remained highly sensitive \r\nto the political realities and sentiments of States, \r\nwhile acting in accordance with the provisions of the \r\nCharter, its own Statute and other applicable rules of \r\ninternational law.\r\nDuring the judicial year 2015-2016, the Court \r\ndelivered a judgment in two cases between Nicaragua \r\nand Costa Rica, on 16 December 2015. That was a rare \r\ninstance of the Court’s joining two disputes submitted \r\nby neighbouring States against each other. They are \r\ncases involving complex factual and legal issues \r\nconcerning navigational rights, territorial sovereignty \r\nand environmental impact assessment, among others. \r\nThe number of contentious cases on the Court’s docket \r\nstands at 14, three of which were disposed of by the \r\nCourt on 5 October. During the past judicial year, the \r\nCourt handed down 11 orders and held public hearings \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n16/25 16-34541\r\nin five cases, including a case brought against my own \r\ncountry, India.\r\nThe cases before the Court involve a variety \r\nof subject matters, such as territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes, unlawful use of force, interference in the \r\ndomestic affairs of States, violation of territorial \r\nintegrity, international humanitarian law and \r\nhuman rights, genocide, environmental damage and \r\nconservation of living resources, immunities of States \r\nand their representatives, and interpretation and \r\napplication of international conventions and treaties. \r\nMoreover, the cases entrusted to the Court are growing \r\nin factual and legal complexity.\r\nThe Court’s second function is to provide advisory \r\nopinions on legal questions referred to it by the organs \r\nof the United Nations and specialized agencies. \r\nAlthough no request for an advisory opinion was made \r\nduring the past judicial year, that function of the Court \r\nadds to its important role of clarifying key international \r\nlegal issues. The report of the Court rightly points out \r\nthat “everything the Court does is aimed at promoting \r\nand reinforcing the rule of law” (A/71/4, para. 21), in \r\nparticular through its judgments and advisory opinions.\r\nBefore concluding my statement, I would like to \r\nmake a few preliminary remarks on the three cases \r\ndisposed of by the Court on 5 October. These were \r\npublic-interest litigation cases. We appreciate the \r\nCourt’s finding that no legal dispute existed between the \r\nparties at the time of submission of the application by \r\nthe litigant State. However, despite some apprehensions \r\nover the possibility of relitigation, India feels that the \r\ncases were dismissed on substance and not merely on \r\nprocedural lacunae. Apart from the awareness test, \r\nthe Court made an objective determination on the \r\nexamination of facts of the case and demonstrated that \r\nthere were no opposing views and, therefore, no dispute \r\nbetween the parties. Furthermore, we note that it was \r\none of the rare occasions of a contentious case in which \r\nthe President of the Court exercised his casting vote.\r\nAs to the publications and availability of \r\ninformation concerning the Court and its activities, \r\nwe appreciate the Court’s efforts to ensure the greatest \r\npossible global awareness of its decisions through its \r\npublications, multimedia offerings and website, which \r\nnow features the Court’s entire jurisprudence, as well \r\nas that of its predecessor, the Permanent Court of \r\nInternational Justice. Those sources provide useful \r\ninformation for States wishing to submit a potential \r\ndispute to the Court.\r\nWe are happy to note that the issue of the presence \r\nof asbestos in the Peace Palace has been, by and large, \r\nresolved. We share the concern of the President of \r\nthe Court with regard to budget cuts and the fact that \r\nthe communication and concerns raised by the Court \r\nremain unresolved and unanswered to date. We hope \r\nthat those concerns will be addressed.\r\nFinally, India wishes to reaffirm its strong support \r\nfor the Court and to acknowledge the importance that \r\nthe international community attaches to the work of the \r\nCourt.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nalign ourselves with the statements delivered earlier \r\nat this meeting by the representative of South Africa \r\non behalf of the Group of African States and by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement.\r\nWe have taken note of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the work of the International Court of Justice \r\n(А/71/339). I would like to thank the President of the \r\nCourt for having presented his report on the Court’s \r\njudicial activity from 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016 \r\n(А/71/4). My delegation greatly appreciates the work \r\nundertaken by the Court, as the principal judicial organ \r\nof the United Nations, namely, its delivery of judgments \r\nand advisory opinions and the contribution it makes to \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes. That essential work \r\nrequires greater political support from Member States. \r\nIn addition, the Court requires the necessary budgetary \r\nfunding to ensure that its activity is not constrained.\r\nThe submission of the annual report is an \r\nopportunity for the General Assembly to confirm the \r\nCourt’s role and jurisdiction. The number of cases that \r\nMember States bring before the Court demonstrates \r\nthe importance that they attach to the Court and its \r\ncapacity to resolve disputes in an impartial and fair \r\nmanner. On behalf of the Sudan, we urge the Court \r\nto continue the work being carried out to strengthen \r\nits ability to assume its increased responsibilities and \r\nworkload so that it can swiftly and effectively resolve \r\nthe cases before it. We call for the necessary resources \r\nto be made available to it.\r\n My delegation also calls on States that have not \r\nyet done so to quickly ratify the Statute of the Court \r\nwith a view to strengthening the rule of law at the \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 17/25\r\ninternational level and to ensuring that the Court is \r\nable to discharge its responsibilities under the Statute \r\nwith regard to the peaceful settlement of disputes. The \r\nSudan has recognized the Court’s jurisdiction. We \r\ninvite the Security Council, which has not requested \r\nan advisory opinion from the Court since 1970, to \r\nmake greater use of this body, which is the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations and the source \r\nof the main advisory opinions with regard to the \r\ninterpretation of the principles of international law \r\nrelated to the Organization’s work. We also invite the \r\nAssembly, as a principal organ of the United Nations, to \r\ncontinuously request advisory opinions with regard to \r\nthe interpretation of the principles of international law \r\nrelated to its functions.\r\nWe greatly appreciate the role played by the Court, \r\nand we express our full support to the Court so that \r\nit can carry out its responsibilities mandated under \r\nits Statute.\r\nMs. Biden Owens (United States of America): \r\nWe thank President Abraham for his thorough report \r\ntoday. President Abraham’s report reminds us that \r\ninternational justice is alive and well. We welcome \r\nthe fact that States are increasingly resorting to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice and to other international \r\njudicial bodies to resolve their bilateral disputes where \r\nboth parties to that dispute have accepted the body’s \r\njurisdiction. Rather than seeing what some often decry \r\nas a fragmentation of international dispute resolution \r\nmechanisms, we see a healthy array, or, as one judge \r\nof the International Court of Justice has called it, “a \r\nkaleidoscope of complementary judicial venues”, so that \r\nStates may choose which forum best suits their needs.\r\nResort to an appropriate dispute resolution \r\nmechanism is a means to pursue the peaceful resolution \r\nof disputes and an embrace of Article 33 of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, which, as we will recall, \r\nprovides that:\r\n“The parties to any dispute, the continuance \r\nof which is likely to endanger the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, shall, first of all, \r\nseek a solution by negotiation, enquiry, mediation, \r\nconciliation, arbitration, judicial settlement, resort \r\nto regional agencies or arrangements, or other \r\npeaceful means of their own choice.”\r\nThe drafters of the Charter had the wisdom to make \r\nthe International Court of Justice one of the principal \r\norgans of the United Nations, putting the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes at the heart of the United Nations.\r\n In April, we welcomed the opportunity to \r\ncelebrate the seventieth anniversary of the Court’s \r\ninaugural setting at the Peace Palace. It gave us and \r\nothers a unique opportunity to reflect on the important \r\nrole the Court has played over the past 70 years. We \r\necho President Abraham’s message that the need for a \r\nworld court working for international peace and justice \r\nis as strong today as it was when the Charter was first \r\nsigned, and we applaud the Court for its readiness to \r\ntake on the many new and difficult challenges brought \r\nbefore it.\r\nThe United States is grateful to President Abraham \r\nand his fellow judges and to all the staff of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for the hard work they do \r\nto foster international justice.\r\nMr. Reinisch (Austria): The delegation of Austria \r\nwishes to express its thanks to the President of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, Mr. Ronny Abraham, \r\nfor the comprehensive report on the work of the Court \r\n(А/71/4). Austria also wants to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate the Court on its seventieth anniversary, \r\ncelebrated on 20 April in The Hague.\r\nThe report impressively demonstrates the growing \r\ncaseload of the Court over the past two decades. The \r\nCourt currently deals with a variety of disputes ranging \r\nfrom core issues of sovereignty — like territorial or \r\nmaritime disputes, the use of force and non-intervention, \r\nand the immunity of States and their representatives —\r\nto disputes relating to genocide and to the protection \r\nof the environment, as well as to treaty application \r\nand interpretation. That development aptly shows \r\nthe increasing general acceptance of the Court as the \r\ncentral forum for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nIn that context, the Austrian delegation wants \r\nto emphasize the importance of the possibility of \r\naccepting the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \r\nunder Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute. \r\nAs of now, only 72 of the 193 States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations have made a declaration recognizing \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction in that way. Austria did so in \r\n1971, a commitment automatically renewed ever since. \r\nUnfortunately, however, many States still do not accept \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. Austria calls \r\nupon those States to reassess their positions and to \r\nseriously consider accepting its jurisdiction.\r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n18/25 16-34541\r\nBeyond solving specific disputes, the Court greatly \r\ncontributes to the strengthening and clarification of \r\ninternational law. As the principal judicial organ of \r\nthe United Nations, the International Court of Justice \r\nis nowadays at the centre of a system of international \r\ncourts and tribunals and other dispute settlement \r\nbodies. In that context, the issue of fragmentation \r\nof international law and international jurisprudence \r\nhas been raised, including in the International Law \r\nCommission. To avoid such fragmentation and possible \r\ndiscrepancies in the interpretation of international law, \r\nit is essential that international courts and tribunals \r\ntake each other’s decisions into account and that the \r\njudges of those courts and tribunals establish direct \r\ncontacts. Therefore, we welcome the judicial dialogue \r\nwhich is currently being developed between those \r\ninternational courts and tribunals, and we support \r\nits further enhancement. To that end, it would be \r\nparticularly useful if the presentation of the work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court took place on the same \r\nday as this debate.\r\nAs the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, the Court upholds and promotes the rule of \r\nlaw. Austria is strongly committed to strengthening the \r\nrule of law and believes that a rules-based international \r\nsystem, with clear and predictable rules, is an essential \r\nprecondition for lasting peace, security, economic \r\ndevelopment and social progress. We call upon all \r\nMember States to actively promote an international \r\norder based on the rule of law and international law, \r\nwith the United Nations at its core. Building on the \r\nfinal report and recommendations from the Austrian \r\nInitiative, 2004-2008, regarding the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council and the rule of law, presented in 2008, \r\nmy delegation has been continuously working to foster \r\nthe rule of law in all United Nations organs and in the \r\ninternational community at large and is proud to serve \r\nas the coordinator of the Group of Friends of the Rule \r\nof Law.\r\nAs regards judicial activities during the reporting \r\nperiod, the Austrian delegation has noted that the Court \r\ndealt with a number of very important issues that also \r\nrelate to the topics discussed over the past few days \r\nin the Sixth Committee in connection with the work \r\nof the International Law Commission. The Court is \r\ncurrently dealing with the immunities of State officials \r\nin criminal proceedings and with a number of disputes \r\ninvolving environmental concerns. Among the latter, \r\nthe judgment of the Court, rendered on 16 December \r\n2015 in the joined cases between Costa Rica and \r\nNicaragua, is particularly noteworthy. In that judgment, \r\nthe Court, basing itself on the judgment in Pulp \r\nMills on the River Uruguay (Argentina v. Uruguay), \r\nreaffirmed an obligation under general international \r\nlaw to carry out an environmental impact assessment \r\nconcerning activities that risk causing significant \r\ntransboundary harm.\r\nAustria also wants to draw attention to the special \r\nimportance of the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\nand nuclear disarmament, which has recently been \r\nconsidered again by the Court. In the past, the Court \r\nmade important contributions to this field with its \r\nadvisory opinion on Legality of the Threat or Use of \r\nNuclear Weapons. Recently, however, the applications \r\nfiled by the Marshall Islands against India, Pakistan and \r\nthe United Kingdom were dismissed on jurisdictional \r\ngrounds, by a narrow vote. The great interest that those \r\ncases attracted within the international community, \r\ntogether with the deliberations currently ongoing in the \r\nAssembly’s Disarmament and International Security \r\nCommittee (First Committee), demonstrates the crucial \r\nimportance of that topic for many States. Austria, \r\nas a non-nuclear country, takes this opportunity to \r\nrestate its commitment to, and the importance of, \r\nthe non-proliferation and disarmament processes \r\nand expresses its hope that those processes will yield \r\nconcrete results in the near future.\r\nMs. Galvão Teles (Portugal) (spoke in French): \r\nAt the outset, allow me to express my delegation’s \r\ngratitude to the President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, Judge Ronny Abraham, for his detailed annual \r\nreport on the work of the Court.\r\nOn the occasion of its seventieth anniversary, the \r\nfundamental role of the Court in the international \r\nlegal order must be recalled and stressed, as it is the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations and, in \r\nthat capacity, performs one the most important tasks in \r\nthe international community — the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes among States and the strengthening of the \r\ninternational rule of law.\r\nAs the report for the judicial year 2015-2016 \r\n(A/71/4) indicates, the Court’s workload is constantly \r\nincreasing. For example, in July 2016 the number of \r\ncases pending before the Court stood at 14, and three \r\nnew contentious cases had recently been submitted to \r\nit. During the period in question, the Court delivered \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 19/25\r\n5 judgments and 11 orders and held public hearings in \r\n5 cases.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe note with satisfaction the growing activity of \r\nthe Court. More and more States trust the Court with \r\nthe settlement of their complex and sensitive disputes. \r\nIt is important to note that the cases before the Court \r\ncome from all over the world and relate to diverse areas \r\nof international law, such as the law of the sea, the use \r\nof force, sovereignty, immunities and international \r\nhumanitarian law, demonstrating not only the \r\nuniversality of the Court, but also the expansion of the \r\nscope of its work and its growing specialization. Such \r\nuniversality and growth dramatically strengthen the \r\nCourt’s contribution to the development of international \r\nlaw and should therefore earn for it the full support of \r\nall members of the international community.\r\nAlthough, as the truly universal court in the \r\nexercise of general jurisdiction, the International \r\nCourt of Justice is a leading player in the international \r\njudicial arena, it should be recalled that there are other \r\ninternational courts and tribunals whose existence \r\nand importance should also be underlined. In that \r\nregard, Portugal welcomes the continued contacts and \r\ncooperation among international courts and tribunals \r\nas a very positive development. It is our strong view \r\nthat all of them must work together towards the \r\nenhancement of the international legal order and must \r\ncomplement one another in the furtherance of this goal.\r\nAs at 31 July, 193 States were parties to the Statute \r\nof the Court and 72 of them had deposited with the \r\nSecretary-General a declaration of acceptance of \r\nthe Court’s compulsory jurisdiction, in accordance \r\nwith Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Court’s Statute. \r\nMoreover, more than 300 bilateral or multilateral \r\ntreaties provide for the Court to have jurisdiction in the \r\nsettlement of disputes arising out of their application \r\nor interpretation. That highlights the role of the Court \r\nas the main judicial body in the interpretation and \r\napplication of international law.\r\nIn that context, Portugal, as a State that has \r\naccepted the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court \r\nsince its admission to the United Nations in 1955 and \r\nhas been a party to proceedings before it, would like to \r\nrecall the recommendation of the 2005 World Summit \r\nthat States that have not yet done so, consider accepting \r\nthe jurisdiction of the Court, in accordance with its \r\nStatute. It would also be desirable, in our view, that, in \r\nmultilateral or bilateral agreements, more consideration \r\nshould be given to accepting the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt, including on an optional basis.\r\nTo conclude, we would like to state that, while \r\nrecognizing that in contemporary international law \r\nthere is an intrinsic but unavoidable paradox between \r\nthe obligation of States to settle their disputes in a \r\npeaceful manner and the paramount need for sovereign \r\nconsent to put into practice such settlement mechanisms, \r\nit is our firm conviction that the International Court \r\nof Justice plays a crucial role in the international legal \r\norder and that that role will be increasingly accepted by \r\nthe entire international community.\r\nMr. Koch (Germany): The International Court \r\nof Justice is the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations. It is the only court with its legal basis in the \r\nvery Charter of the United Nations, and, thanks to the \r\nCharter, its membership is truly universal. That gives \r\nthe Court enormous prestige and weight, which it can \r\nuse to play its important role in the peaceful settlement \r\nof conflicts in accordance with the rules of international \r\nlaw. Germany has always supported the Court, and \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm our \r\nsupport once again today.\r\nI want to highlight two specific issues of particular \r\nimportance. \r\nFirst, the Court can be an effective means for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes and the furtherance \r\nof international law as the defining framework of \r\ninternational relations only if its judgments are \r\nimplemented. Compliance by the parties to a case with \r\nthe judgment of the Court, as required by Article 94 \r\nof the Charter, is therefore of obvious and paramount \r\nimportance. Refusal or failure to comply with a \r\njudgment not only frustrates the Court’s efforts to \r\nbring to a conclusion the dispute in question, it also \r\nundermines respect for the Court, and therefore its \r\noverall efficiency as an instrument for settling disputes, \r\nfar beyond any single case. It should also be noted that it \r\nis for the Court to decide whether the conditions for its \r\njurisdiction are met. Once the Court has decided that it \r\nhas jurisdiction, the parties should accept its decision. \r\nBoth of those points, incidentally, apply to other courts, \r\ntribunals and arbitral tribunals as well.\r\nSecondly, the Court’s jurisdiction, like that of other \r\ninternational tribunals and arbitral tribunals, is based \r\non the consent of the States concerned. That is a well-\r\nestablished principle in international law. Consent may \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n20/25 16-34541\r\nbe granted ad hoc with regard to a specific dispute or \r\nit may be declared in advance, in a general way, as \r\nprovided for in Article 36, paragraph 2, of the Statute \r\nof the Court. Germany has made a declaration under \r\nArticle 36, paragraph 2, and we call upon others to \r\nconsider a similar step.\r\nThe obverse of the aforementioned principle, \r\nhowever, is that there can be no dispute settlement \r\nby the Court without the consent of the parties to the \r\ndispute. That does not mean that what is essentially a \r\ndispute between two States should be turned into an \r\nabstract legal question on which the Court is then asked \r\nto give an advisory opinion. Such a development would \r\nalso put the Court in a difficult position. Rather, the \r\nadvisory opinion procedure is meant for cases where a \r\nlegal issue as such is of widespread interest to many or \r\nall States.\r\nThe International Court of Justice is the most \r\nprominent instrument for settling disputes on the basis \r\nof law. States should cherish it for that reason, and, \r\nwhat is more, they should make proper use of it to settle \r\ntheir disputes more often.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nPeru welcomes the report of the International Court of \r\nJustice on its work during the period from 1 August \r\n2015 to 31 July 2016 (A/71/4) and thanks the Court’s \r\nPresident, Judge Ronny Abraham, for introducing it.\r\nMy delegation would like to begin its statement \r\nby underscoring the fundamental role played by the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the principal judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations, in the system of peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes established in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Its work is an essential contribution \r\nto the promotion of the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. We recall that, in addition to that valuable \r\nfunction, in accordance with Article 96 of the Charter, \r\nthe Court’s advisory opinion may be requested by the \r\nGeneral Assembly, the Security Council and other \r\norgans and specialized agencies of the United Nations \r\nsystem. Those are the two areas of responsibility of the \r\nCourt. Through its judgments and opinions, it helps to \r\npromote and clarify international law as a true pathway \r\nto peace. Accordingly, my delegation would like to \r\npoint out that the Assembly has once again urged States \r\nthat have not yet done so to consider the possibility \r\nof recognizing the Court’s jurisdiction, in accordance \r\nwith Article 36, paragraph 2, of its Statute.\r\nMy delegation would like to acknowledge the \r\nwork carried out by the eminent judges of the Court, \r\nin particular the President and Vice-President, and by \r\nthe ad hoc judges. By the same token, we would like to \r\nput on record our gratitude for the considerable work \r\ncarried out by the Registry of the Court, in particular \r\nby the Registrar and the Deputy Registrar. In that \r\ncontext, we call on the Assembly to continue to give \r\ncareful consideration to the needs of the Court.\r\nThe sustained level of activity of the Court is the \r\nexpression of the prestige enjoyed by that principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. That prestige is \r\nalso reflected in the diverse geographical distribution \r\nof the cases brought before it, which reaffirms the \r\nuniversal character of its jurisdiction. It was thanks to \r\nthe Court that the maritime boundary dispute between \r\nPeru and Chile was resolved peacefully and pursuant to \r\ninternational law. The high level of activity of the Court \r\ncan be partly explained by the numerous measures \r\nadopted in recent years to improve its efficiency and \r\nto allow it to handle its ever-increasing workload, \r\nincluding the expedited processing of the growing \r\nnumber of incidental proceedings.\r\nAdditionally, Peru welcomes the various activities \r\nin April in The Hague, particularly the solemn sitting \r\non 20 April held to commemorate the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the inaugural sitting of the Court. We \r\nnote with satisfaction that the photographic exhibition \r\norganized for that occasion at the Peace Palace was \r\nrecently brought to United Nations Headquarters in \r\nNew York\r\nWe once again thank the host country, the Kingdom \r\nof the Netherlands, for its ongoing commitment to and \r\nsupport for the work of the Court. We reiterate our \r\nbelief that there should be greater cooperation between \r\nthe Court and the other principal organs of the United \r\nNations, in New York. In that regard, my delegation \r\nencourages the good relations between the Court and \r\nthe Security Council to continue.\r\nI would like to end my statement by expressing \r\nour gratitude once again to the Court for its continuous \r\ncontribution to international peace and justice and to \r\nthe effective implementation of the principle of pacific \r\nsettlement of disputes between States.\r\nMs. Pino Rivero (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): Cuba \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered earlier by the \r\nrepresentative of the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf \r\nof the Non-Aligned Movement. \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 21/25\r\nThe Republic of Cuba welcomes the presentation of \r\nthe report of the International Court of Justice (A/71/4). \r\nWe also wish to express our commitment to the strict \r\napplication of international law and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of international disputes.\r\nCuba recognizes the work of the Court since its \r\ninception. Its decisions and advisory opinions have \r\nbeen vital, not only for the cases brought before it, but \r\nalso for the development of public international law. \r\nThe volume of cases referred to it, many of them from \r\nthe Latin American and Caribbean region, show the \r\nimportance the international community attaches to the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nThe Republic of Cuba greatly values the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes under Article 33, paragraph 1, of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. It regrets that certain of \r\nthe Court’s rulings have not been implemented, in open \r\nviolation of Article 94 of the Charter, which establishes \r\nthat each Member of the United Nations undertakes to \r\ncomply with the decision of the International Court of \r\nJustice in any case to which it is a party. That situation \r\nreflects the need to reform the United Nations system \r\nto give developing countries greater guarantees in their \r\ndealings with powerful countries.\r\nCuba believes that it would be useful for the Court \r\nto take stock of its relationship with United Nations \r\nbodies, particularly the Security Council.\r\nThe Court has heard many significant cases. Cuba \r\nattaches great importance to the advisory opinion, \r\nissued unanimously on 8 July 1996, on Legality of \r\nthe Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons. In it the Court \r\nconcluded that there exists an obligation to pursue \r\nin good faith and bring to a conclusion negotiations \r\nleading to nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under \r\nstrict and effective international control. In that regard, \r\nand as has been expressed in this Hall, Cuba urges full \r\ncompliance with the advisory opinion of 9 July 2004 \r\non Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall \r\nin the Occupied Palestinian Territory, and calls upon \r\nall States to respect and ensure respect for the Court’s \r\nstipulations in that important matter.\r\nCuba also attaches great importance to the \r\nallocation of the necessary budgetary resources for the \r\nCourt so that it can adequately carry out its work of \r\npeacefully resolving the disputes under its jurisdiction, \r\nand urges that the necessary resources be found so \r\nthat they reach the Court in an appropriate and timely \r\nmanner. \r\nThe Republic of Cuba thanks the Court for the \r\npublications it has made available to the Governments \r\nparties to the Statute and for its online resources. They \r\nare valuable material for the dissemination and study of \r\nfundamental public international law, particularly for \r\ndeveloping countries, some of which have no access to \r\ninformation regarding advances in international law.\r\nCuba has been a peace-loving country, respectful \r\nof international law..It has always faithfully complied \r\nwith its international obligations deriving from the \r\ntreaties to which it is party. Accordingly, Cuba would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to reiterate its commitment \r\nto peace. \r\nThe events in recent years are a reliable \r\ndemonstration of the importance of the International \r\nCourt of Justice as an organ with international \r\njurisdiction that, peacefully, in good faith and in \r\naccordance with international law, settles the disputes \r\nof great impact on the international community.\r\nMr. Argüello (Nicaragua) (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nmore than one occasion, the General Assembly has \r\nseen that the adjudication of legal disputes, particularly \r\nthe referral of cases to the International Court of \r\nJustice, should not be regarded as an unfriendly action \r\namong Staates. Yet, after 70 years of work by the \r\nCourt — which we are celebrating this year — only 72 \r\nStates have recognized the compulsory jurisdiction of \r\nthe principal judicial organ of this Organization. \r\nFrom the time that the League of Nations was \r\nestablished, there has been an understanding about \r\nthe imperative need for an international legal body to \r\npromote and contribute to the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes — hence the birth of the Permanent Court of \r\nInternational Justice. The United Nations validated that \r\nunderstanding by establishing the present International \r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nOver the past seven decades, the Court has been \r\na cornerstone in the development of international law \r\nand, to some extent, in the strengthening of friendly \r\nrelations among States, as it has applied international \r\nlaw to resolve numerous disputes that otherwise might \r\nhave become threats to international peace. It has \r\nalso provided important support to the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly through its advisory opinions on \r\ntopics of vital importance to the Organization, and in \r\ndoing so has bolstered respect for the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level.\r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n22/25 16-34541\r\nThe report before us reflects the trust that Member \r\nStates have in this principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, as is confirmed by the growing number of \r\ncases. The heavy workload merits additional resources, \r\nnot fewer. We should recall that the cases brought \r\nbefore the Court concern, for the most part, sensitive \r\ntopics or issues with major legal, political or social \r\nimplications for Member States and their populations, \r\nand sometimes for multiple States within a region. \r\nAnd because of the complexity of the issues, complex \r\ntechnical advice is often needed. Therefore, making \r\navailable adequate human and technical resources \r\nenhances the effectiveness and independence of the \r\nCourt. Its work is unique even though there has been \r\na proliferation of international courts with budgets far \r\ngreater than that of the International Court of Justice.\r\nFor that reason, we find it particularly disturbing \r\nthat the Court, with the enormous amount of work that \r\nit does and given its very sensitive and crucial mission, \r\nis to have its budget cut by 10 per cent compared to \r\nthe last biennium, as indicated in paragraph 33 of the \r\nCourt’s report (A/71/4). It would therefore appear that \r\nthis institution, which is a fundamental pillar of the \r\nUnited Nations, has been treated like the Cinderella \r\nof the house. In past years, the International Law \r\nCommission has also suffered a budget cut and the \r\nstipend for its members was reduced to $1, and now the \r\nbudget of the principal organ of international justice is \r\nalso being reduced. We must not allow that to happen. \r\nIn the case of Nicaragua, a small developing \r\ncountry, access to the International Court of Justice has \r\nbeen crucial in safeguarding our national interests. We \r\nhave had recourse to the Court on several occasions. In \r\n2015 alone, Nicaragua was involved in oral arguments \r\nfor four different cases, and in two of those cases \r\njudgments on the merits were handed down. In the \r\nother two, Colombia’s preliminary objections to the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction were rejected. As a State party \r\nin different cases, Nicaragua knows at first hand the \r\nfinancial challenges that on occasion obligate the \r\nCourt to recover the costs of certain proceedings. That \r\ncauses difficulties for less wealthy countries and for the \r\ngeneral working of the institution.\r\nCountries that have been party to international \r\nlitigation know the enormous costs thereof, but we \r\nwant our rights to use peaceful settlement mechanisms \r\nto be respected, and Nicaragua will spare no expense \r\nto that end. International law should be defended at all \r\ncosts. And the Court does so with low expenditures and \r\nexcellent administration. In this regard, we recall that \r\nthere is a trust fund to assist States in settling disputes \r\nthrough the International Court of Justice. This is \r\nan important mechanism for facilitating access for \r\ndeveloping countries. States are therefore encouraged to \r\nconsider making contributions to the fund, particularly \r\non the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nCourt.\r\nTo conclude, Nicaragua would like to take this \r\nopportunity to reaffirm that in all cases it has been \r\ninvolved in we have faithfully complied with our \r\ninternational obligations, and we expect reciprocity \r\nfrom other parties in terms of abiding by the rulings of \r\nthe International Court of Justice in cases to which they \r\nare parties. We would like to recall that “the existence \r\nof a dispute shall [not] permit the use of force or threat \r\nof force by any of the States parties to the dispute” \r\n(resolution 37/10, annex, sect. I, para. 13). \r\nOnce again, we thank the Court for its report and \r\nnote that although much remains to be done to ensure \r\nrespect for justice and international law, the experience \r\nacquired during 70 years of the work of this international \r\ntribunal has brought us valuable opportunities to \r\nachieve peace, a fundamental purpose of the United \r\nNations and an ongoing desire of humankind.\r\nMr. Bailen (Philippines): We align ourselves with \r\nthe statement delivered earlier by the representative \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement.\r\nThe very first purpose of the United Nations is \r\nto maintain international peace and security. Article \r\n1, paragraph 1 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nobligates us\r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in conformity \r\nwith the principles of justice and international law, \r\nadjustment or settlement of international disputes \r\nor situations which might lead to a breach of the \r\npeace”.\r\nTo maintain international peace and security, all \r\nMember States are duty-bound to settle their disputes by \r\npeaceful means, including through judicial settlement \r\nand in conformity with the principles of justice and \r\ninternational law. As the principal judicial organ of the \r\nUnited Nations, the International Court of Justice plays \r\na central role in the peaceful settlement of disputes as \r\nthe condition sine qua non for maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 23/25\r\nThat point was recognized no less by the Manila \r\nDeclaration on the Peaceful Settlement of International \r\nDisputes, which the General Assembly adopted in \r\n1982 (resolution 37/10, annex). The Manila Declaration \r\nis the first comprehensive plan and consolidation of \r\nthe legal framework for the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes, building upon the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, in particular its Article 33, and general \r\ninternational law. It may be no coincidence that the \r\ncaseload of the Court doubled in the era ushered in by \r\nthe Manila Declaration. \r\nFour years ago, the Assembly also affirmed the \r\nCourt’s essential contribution to the rule of law in \r\nparagraph 31 of its landmark Declaration on the rule of \r\nlaw at the national and international levels.\r\nThis year, the Philippines joins the commemoration \r\nof the Court’s seventieth anniversary. On this happy \r\noccasion, we extend our warm greetings to the entire \r\nteam at The Hague, led by President Ronny Abraham, \r\nwhom we also thank for his comprehensive report on \r\nthe work of the Court in the past year.\r\nIn the period under review, the Court was seized \r\nof 14 cases, ranging from territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes and violations of territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty to the unlawful use of force, interference \r\nin domestic affairs, international humanitarian and \r\nhuman rights law, to environmental damage and the \r\nconservation of living resources. The increasing \r\nconfidence shown by Member States, especially among \r\ndeveloping countries, in the capabilities, credibility \r\nand impartiality of the Court to settle disputes by \r\npeaceful means, is not unrelated to the norms, values \r\nand aspirations articulated by the Manila Declaration, \r\nthe most fundamental of which is not to use, or threaten \r\nto use, force.\r\nThe contemporary international legal architecture \r\nhas strengthened the Court as the only forum for \r\nresolving justiciable disputes between States with \r\nrespect to the vast field of general international law. It \r\nis the only international court of a universal character \r\nwith general jurisdiction, which is why we renew our \r\ncall for Member States that have not yet done so to \r\naccept the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. It is \r\nalso why we reiterate our call on the Security Council \r\nto more seriously consider Article 96 of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, and make greater use of the Court \r\nas a source of advisory opinions and of interpretation \r\nof relevant norms of international law, particularly on \r\nthe most current and controversial issues affecting \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nFinally, the General Assembly, as a matter \r\nof courtesy and due process and in the interest of \r\ntransparency and fairness in the efficient administration \r\nof justice, should always consult with the Court with \r\nrespect to its budget. The Court should always have \r\nthe opportunity to make its views and specific needs \r\nknown in the budget process.\r\nThe Philippines believes that only through the rule \r\nof law in international relations can we guarantee the \r\nrespect, order and stability that we the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations are striving to achieve.\r\nMr. Alday González (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico wishes to express its appreciation to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for the activities it has \r\nundertaken this year, and is grateful to its President, \r\nJudge Ronny Abraham, for the valuable report he has \r\npresented (A/71/4).\r\nWe extend our congratulations to the Court on \r\nits seventieth anniversary. In its work as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations, the International \r\nCourt of Justice has handled more than 130 contentious \r\ncases. Through its rulings it has helped prevent and \r\nput an end to specific disputes and conflicts that have \r\nthreatened the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity.\r\nToday we face the emergence of a broad range \r\nof controversies, from climate justice to the new \r\nmodalities and actors of armed conflicts, which \r\nchallenge international law and the political organs \r\nof the United Nations itself. The effectiveness of the \r\nCourt is therefore more necessary than ever if peaceful \r\nsolutions are to be found.\r\nIn its Declaration on the rule of law at the national \r\nand international levels, in 2012, the General Assembly \r\nrecognized that the International Court of Justice plays \r\na major role in contributing to and promoting the rule \r\nof law at the international level. This goes hand in hand \r\nwith the implementation of Goal 16 of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, which specifically seeks \r\nto strengthen a genuine rule of law as a prerequisite for \r\naccountability, justice and peace.\r\nWe welcome the fact that during the reporting \r\nperiod, another State deposited its declaration of \r\nacceptance of the compulsory jurisdiction of the Court, \r\nmaking a total of 72 States that have accepted its \r\nA/71/PV.34 27/10/2016\r\n24/25 16-34541\r\njurisdiction. We call on States that have not yet done \r\nso to recognize the binding jurisdiction of the Court so \r\nthat the operative and preventive capacity of this organ \r\ncan be extended and strengthened.\r\nHowever, we note with some concern certain \r\nactions taken by some States that put restrictions on \r\nthis organ, by, for example, formulating reservations \r\non the exercise of jurisdiction of the Court, denouncing \r\ntreaties that establish jurisdictional clauses in favour of \r\nthe Court, or opposing the inclusion of articles for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes referred to the Court in \r\nthe negotiation processes of new international treaties.\r\nWe wish to stress that compliance with the judgments \r\nof the Court, including those related to the granting of \r\nprovisional measures, is essential for reducing political \r\ntensions among States. If left unaddressed, these issues \r\ncan escalate into international conflicts.\r\nWe are pleased to note that, according to the report, \r\nStates from all regions of the world have resorted to \r\nthe Court. The delegation of Mexico would particularly \r\nlike to highlight that, of the 11 cases pending, 6 involve \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. This has in fact \r\nbecome a trend in recent years and demonstrates the \r\ncommitment of our region to international law and the \r\nprinciple of the peaceful settlement of disputes set out \r\nin Article 33 of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe ruling of the Court during the reporting \r\nperiod represents an important contribution to the \r\ninterpretation of international law, reaffirming the \r\nscope of the obligation contained in international \r\nenvironmental law in order to assess the environmental \r\nimpact of activities that may result in transboundary \r\ndamages as well as the importance of the precautionary \r\nprinciple in the matter. The ruling also contributes to \r\nreaffirming the navigation rights of States.\r\nThe Court also had three cases under review in this \r\nperiod which, thanks simply to their presentation, served \r\nto highlight the effect of customary obligation of States \r\nto negotiate effective measures for the cessation of the \r\nnuclear arms race, nuclear disarmament and the adoption \r\nof a treaty on general and complete disarmament.\r\nMexico welcomes the work done to strengthen \r\npublicity and transparency of the work of the Court, \r\ntaking advantage of new technologies. These contribute \r\nto the dissemination of international law and also serve \r\nas tools for States, academia and society in general.\r\nWe reiterate the important fact that, as part of these \r\nefforts, we should soon have access to all judgments of \r\nthe Court in all official languages  of the United Nations. \r\nMexico wishes to reiterate the importance of endowing \r\nthe Court with sufficient funds to fulfil its mandate \r\neffectively, especially as there has been a steady \r\nincrease in the number of cases that are submitted to it.\r\nFinally, we call for the continued modernization of \r\nthe International Court of Justice so that it may continue \r\nto be useful and relevant in the current global context, \r\nas it has indeed been for the past 70 years.\r\nMs. Metelko-Zgombić (Croatia): Croatia thanks \r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice, \r\nJudge Ronny Abraham, for his report on the work of \r\nthe Court over the past year.\r\nIn the reporting period, the Court deliberated on a \r\nsignificant number of cases raised before it by States \r\non a wide array of topics and issues. Croatia continues \r\nto follow the work of the International Court of Justice \r\nand all its activities with careful and engaged interest.\r\nCroatia remains an unequivocal advocate of the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes between States and \r\nthe avoidance of conflict, based on the premise of \r\nadherence to the rule of international law. In this \r\nvein, we recall that the rule of international law and \r\nrespect for its norms include the requirement to respect \r\ntreaties in force in good faith, as breaches of treaties, \r\nand especially of their essential provisions, prevent \r\nthe fulfilment of their object and purpose and thereby \r\nerode the rule of law and international relations.\r\nThe principal judicial organ of the United Nations \r\nis pivotal in ensuring that the rule of law on the \r\ninternational level is strengthened and secured. Its role \r\nin this regard is essential, as the International Court \r\nof Justice serves as a signpost for other international \r\ntribunals and third-party settlement mechanisms -- in \r\nother words, for international adjudication in general.\r\nInternational adjudication in general must be \r\ndeveloped in accordance with the highest legal and \r\nmoral standards. The confidence of States that disputes \r\nwill be decided upon competently, independently \r\nand impartially as well as within the realm of \r\ninternational law is of paramount importance for the \r\nwillingness of States to turn to judicial settlement for \r\nthe resolution of their disputes and their choice of the \r\nlegal framework over any other. In that connection, the \r\nlack of independence and impartiality in international \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.34\r\n16-34541 25/25\r\nadjudication undermines the very pillars of the \r\ninternational judicial architecture, strips it of its hard-\r\nfought authority and threatens our perennial efforts to \r\ndevelop and secure it, while at the same time propelling \r\nStates into unending disputes and diminishing the trust \r\nof States in third-party settlement mechanisms.\r\nAs jurisprudence within the framework of \r\napplicable international law must be stable and \r\npredictable, so also must its procedures and the ways \r\nof accessing it. Croatia’s unwavering commitment to \r\ninternational law and its proper application goes hand \r\nin hand with its support for the International Court of \r\nJustice in its efforts in this regard.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
