"United Nations A/71/PV.35\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n35th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 27 October 2016, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Zamora Rivas \r\n(El Salvador), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 70 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice\r\nReport of the International Court of Justice \r\n(A/71/4)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/339)\r\nMs. Hioureas (Cyprus): It is a particular honour \r\nand pleasure for the Republic of Cyprus to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly on its consideration of the report \r\nof the International Court of Justice (A/71/4). We are \r\ngrateful to President Judge Ronny Abraham for his \r\nintroduction of the report and for his insightful remarks \r\non the work and functioning of the Court (see A/71/\r\nPV.34). \r\nOur debate this year has special significance as we \r\nmark the seventieth anniversary of the establishment of \r\nthe Court. We welcome the commemorative activities \r\nand initiatives outlined in its report. On this occasion \r\nwe wish to commend the Court on its significant work \r\nas the principal judicial organ of the United Nations \r\nand to pay tribute to past and present members of the \r\nCourt who have served and who serve the Court with \r\ndedication and distinction. Since its creation in 1946, \r\nthe Court has heard more than 160 cases and delivered \r\n121 judgments and 27 advisory opinions, which have \r\ncontributed significantly to the maintenance of peace \r\nand security and to the development of international \r\nlaw. \r\nDuring the period under review, the International \r\nCourt of Justice experienced a high level of judicial \r\nactivity, with pending contentious cases involving \r\nStates from all continents. That diverse geographical \r\ndistribution of cases illustrates the universal character \r\nof the jurisdiction of the principal judicial organ of \r\nthe United Nations. The cases submitted to the Court \r\ninvolve a wide variety of subject matters, including \r\nterritorial and maritime disputes, the unlawful use of \r\nforce, interference in the domestic affairs of States, \r\nviolations of territorial integrity and sovereignty, \r\neconomic rights, international humanitarian and \r\nhuman rights law, genocide, environmental damage and \r\nconservation of living resources, immunities of States \r\nand their officials, and interpretation and application of \r\ninternational treaties and conventions. \r\nSuch diversity of subjects illustrates the general \r\ncharacter of the jurisdiction of the International Court \r\nof Justice. The consistently high workload demonstrates \r\nthe confidence placed in the Court and the respect \r\nshown to it by States. It is imperative that the Court \r\ncontinue to modernize its work as a means to ensure \r\nthat its work is carried out as expeditiously as possible \r\nand that it has the necessary means and resources that \r\nwill continue to ensure its integrity, impartiality and \r\nindependence.\r\nAs the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, the International Court of Justice does work of \r\nutmost importance to the promotion of the rule of law, \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The Court’s jurisdiction over disputes has \r\ninfluenced and shaped international law through the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. \r\nWith trust in the Court’s capacity to deliver justice, \r\nin 2002 the Republic of Cyprus made a declaration \r\nfor recognizing compulsory jurisdiction of the Court. \r\nTo date, we are one of only 72 countries in the world \r\nto have done so. We call upon States to recognize the \r\njurisdiction of the Court in accordance with Article 36 of \r\nthe Statute of the International Court of Justice, thereby \r\npromoting and facilitating the ability of the Court to \r\nmaintain and promote the rule of law throughout the \r\nworld.\r\nMr. Xu Hong (China) (spoke in Chinese): It gives me \r\ngreat pleasure to speak under the agenda item “Report \r\nof the International Court of Justice”. At the outset, \r\nplease allow me, on behalf of the Chinese delegation, \r\nto express my appreciation to President Abraham of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice for his presentation (see \r\nA/71/PV.34). My thanks also go to all the judges and \r\nstaff of the Court for their hard work over the past year.\r\nThis year marks the seventieth anniversary of \r\nthe inaugural sitting of the International Court of \r\nJustice. Over the past 70 years, the Court, in faithfully \r\nimplementing its mandate in accordance with the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and its own Statute, has \r\ndelivered over 120 judgments and issued close to 30 \r\nadvisory opinions. It has played an important role in the \r\ninterpretation, application and development of the rules \r\nof international law and in the peaceful settlement of \r\ninternational disputes, thus making its due contribution \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThe performance of the Court may not be perfect, but \r\nundoubtedly, as one of the six principal organs and the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations, the Court \r\nhas authority and influence that cannot be replaced or \r\nmatched by any other international judicial body.\r\nReviewing the past, we can see that it is no \r\ncoincidence that the International Court of Justice \r\nhas been successful in exercising its jurisdiction. It \r\nhas always acted prudently and has strictly abided \r\nby the principle of the consent of States. The Court’s \r\njudges, who represent major cultures and the principal \r\nlegal systems of the world, have maintained a high \r\nlevel of professionalism, a responsible attitude and a \r\nbalanced judicial approach. The judges and internal \r\nadministrative organs, such as the Registry, have always \r\nkept their independence and been free from external \r\ninterference and influence by reporting to the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council periodically and by \r\nlistening to the views and comments of Member States. \r\nThe Court has, to a certain extent, made it possible for \r\nthe international community to exercise oversight of the \r\nCourt’s work. All the above have laid a solid foundation \r\nfor the Court to carry out its high-quality judicial \r\nactivities on the basis of objectivity and fairness.\r\nAfter a journey of 70 years, the International \r\nCourt of Justice now stands at a new starting point. Its \r\nworkload has been rising, a fact that reflects the trust and \r\nexpectation of the international community, especially \r\ndisputing parties. The international community and \r\nthe United Nations should continue to provide strong \r\nsupport to the Court for it to implement its mandate, \r\nand such support should be in response to the appeal \r\nand the concerns of the Court. That includes ensuring \r\nhuman and financial resources at a level commensurate \r\nwith its responsibilities and status.\r\nAs a responsible member of the international \r\ncommunity, China has always actively promoted \r\nthe peaceful settlement of disputes through friendly \r\nconsultations. We will continue to safeguard the \r\ninternational order, which is based on the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, and to \r\nmaintain and promote the rule of law at the international \r\nlevel. We are confident that an international Court \r\nthat faithfully carries out its mandate according to \r\nthe Charter and its own Statute will continue to be the \r\nmodel and guide for other international judicial bodies, \r\nand will further contribute to the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes and the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nMr. Elshenawy (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank Mr. Ronny Abraham, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for \r\npresenting the report of the Court (A/71/4) on its work \r\nand activities from 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016 (see \r\nA/71/PV.34).\r\nWe align ourselves with the statements delivered \r\nrespectively by the representatives of Iran on behalf of \r\nthe Movement of Non-Aligned Countries and of South \r\nAfrica on behalf of the Group of African States (see \r\nA/71/PV.34).\r\nEgypt strongly believes in the important role of \r\nthe International Court of Justice as the main judicial \r\norgan of the United Nations. We believe that since the \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.35\r\n16-34742 3/13\r\ninception of the Court in June 1945 and the beginning \r\nof its activities in April 1946, the legal and political \r\nlandscape has changed. That has reaffirmed the role \r\nof the Court in the peaceful settlement of conflicts \r\namong countries, as set out in the Charter of the United \r\nNations, and in advancing and strengthening the rule \r\nof law. \r\nThe number of cases before the Court and the \r\nnumber of advisory opinions issued by it have increased. \r\nCurrently, there are diverse cases before it, including \r\nfrom countries on all continents. That underscores the \r\nuniversal aspect of the Court and the absolute trust in it \r\nand its judges, who are all respected and valued by the \r\ninternational community. That is why we need to respect \r\nand implement its decisions and advisory opinions.\r\nNevertheless, and at a time when we are witnessing \r\nan increase in the number of cases before the Court, in \r\nthe past year the Court did not receive any request for an \r\nadvisory opinion, in accordance with Article 96 of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. In that regard, we would \r\nlike to stress how important it is to benefit from the \r\nrole played by the Court and its advisory opinions, as \r\nset out in the Charter, especially on issues that include \r\nlegal disputes. We encourage countries to accept the \r\nmandate of the Court, in accordance with Article 36 of \r\nits Statute, as requested by the General Assembly in its \r\nresolution 70/118, on the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels.\r\nEgypt believes that it is important for the General \r\nAssembly to provide the financial resources the Court \r\nneeds without making any reduction, so that it can \r\ndeliver its message in the best possible way, as the main \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. The Assembly \r\nmust take into consideration the unprecedented \r\nlevel of activities and that Member States have \r\nrepeatedly stressed the need to provide the requisite \r\nfinancial resources to the Court for its independent \r\nadministration.The delegation of Egypt will make sure \r\nthat this will be realized through the Fifth Committee of \r\nthe General Assembly. To assist countries to settle their \r\ndisputes through the International Court of Justice, we \r\nurge countries, especially those who can afford to do \r\nso, to provide financial contributions to the trust fund \r\nthat was established by the Secretary-General in 1989 \r\nfor that purpose.\r\nIn conclusion, Egypt again thanks the International \r\nCourt of Justice and its President, and emphasizes that \r\nit will continue to support the Court.\r\nMr. Elias-Fatile (Nigeria): I thank you, SIr, for \r\nconvening this important meeting to consider the \r\nreport of the International Court of Justice (A/71/4). \r\nNigeria is grateful to the President of the Court, Judge \r\nRonny Abraham, for his comprehensive briefing and \r\ninsightful remarks earlier this morning (see A/71/\r\nPV.34). We congratulate the Court on the celebration \r\nof the seventieth anniversary of its inaugural sitting on \r\n20 April.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the representative of South Africa on behalf of the \r\nGroup of African States (see A/71/PV.34).\r\nThe International Court of Justice is an integral \r\npart of the mechanisms of the United Nations for the \r\npromotion of the rule of law and international peace \r\nand security through the administration of international \r\njustice. There is no gainsaying the fact that the Court has \r\nmade tremendous contributions to the promotion of and \r\nrespect for the rule of law at the international level. In \r\naddition, over the years, the Court has continued to play \r\na vital role in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security through its rulings and judicial notices. \r\nIt has also contributed significantly to the corpus of \r\ninternational jurisprudence. It is remarkable that the \r\nCourt’s judgments, judicial opinions and notices have \r\nhad salutary effects on the maintenance of peace and \r\nsecurity in all regions of the world.\r\nWe have studiously reviewed the Court’s report \r\nfor the period 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016. We have \r\ntaken note of its judicial and other activities during the \r\nreporting period, and we commend the Court for the \r\nmeasures that it has taken in recent years to enhance \r\nits efficiency, which has facilitated the effective \r\nmanagement of its steadily increasing workload. In \r\nparticular, we noted that, during the period under \r\nreview, the Court experienced a high level of judicial \r\nactivity, which included rulings on two cases between \r\nCosta Rica and Nicaragua, public hearings and other \r\npending contentious cases involving States from all \r\ncontinents — six from the Americas, five from Africa, \r\nfour from Europe, three from Asia and one from \r\nOceania. The diverse geographical distribution of those \r\ncases is truly illustrative of the universal character of \r\nthe jurisdiction of the Court.\r\nFurthermore, it is noteworthy that the cases \r\nsubmitted to the Court involve a wide variety of \r\nsubject matters, including territorial and maritime \r\ndisputes, the unlawful use of force, interference \r\nA/71/PV.35 27/10/2016\r\n4/13 16-34742\r\nin the domestic affairs of States, violations of \r\nterritorial integrity and sovereignty, economic rights, \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law, \r\ngenocide, environmental damage and the conservation \r\nof living resources, the immunities of States and their \r\nrepresentatives, and the interpretation and application \r\nof international treaties and conventions. \r\nSignificantly, we also noted in the report that \r\nthe cases that States have entrusted to the Court for \r\nsettlement are growing in factual and legal complexity. \r\nIndeed, the diversity of those issues illustrates the \r\ngeneral character of the jurisdiction of the Court and \r\nattests to the increasing relevance of the Court, both \r\nas a principal organ of the United Nations and as an \r\ninstrument for the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nWe note with appreciation that the Court has \r\ncontinued to publicize its decisions through modern \r\ninformation and communications technology. We \r\nalso welcome the Court’s ongoing engagement with \r\nthe public. Those efforts serve to promote greater \r\ntransparency in its activities. Nevertheless, we observed \r\nthat, during the period under review, no request for \r\nan advisory opinion was submitted to the Court. The \r\nimportance of advisory opinions on legal questions \r\nreferred to the Court in the pursuit of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes cannot be overemphasized. We \r\ntherefore encourage more use of the Court for advisory \r\nopinions on sundry issues.\r\nUnder the provision of Article 36, paragraphs 2 \r\nand 5, of the Statute of the Court, States are expected \r\nto make declarations recognizing the compulsory \r\njurisdiction of the Court. Nigeria notes with concern \r\nthat, of the 193 Member States, only 72 have so far \r\nmade declarations recognizing the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt. That represents less than half of the membership \r\nof the United Nations. We would like to see more \r\ncountries accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt, in consonance with resolution 69/123. We \r\nencourage Member States that have yet to subscribe to \r\nthe compulsory jurisdiction of the Court to endeavour \r\nto do so. That, we believe, would further strengthen the \r\nCourt’s role and ability to promote international justice \r\nand the peaceful settlement of disputes.\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly that Nigeria \r\nwill continue to abide by its commitments to the \r\npromotion of international justice and the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes, as a State party to the Statute \r\nof the International Court of Justice. Having made the \r\ndeclaration recognizing the jurisdiction of the Court as \r\ncompulsory, our acceptance of the ruling of the Court \r\non the border dispute between Nigeria and Cameroon \r\ndemonstrates our conviction and commitment to the \r\nprecepts and principle of the International Court of \r\nJustice. We shall continue to support the Court, where \r\nthree illustrious Nigerians had served meritoriously as \r\njudges. Therefore, we encourage all Member States to \r\ncontinue to offer their support to the activities of the \r\nCourt to promote international justice and the rule \r\nof law.\r\nMr. Llorentty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): The Plurinational State of Bolivia \r\nhas taken note of the report of the International Court \r\nof Justice for the period 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016 \r\n(A/71/4). We would also like to thank the President \r\nof the International Court of Justice, Judge Ronny \r\nAbraham, for his briefing to the Assembly (see A/71/\r\nPV.34).\r\nAs a peaceful nation, Bolivia complies with the \r\ncriteria enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand adheres to the principles of the International Court of \r\nJustice, its jurisdiction and its call for ongoing dialogue \r\nbetween neighbouring nations and brothers. The Court, \r\nits purposes and principles provide new opportunities \r\nto resolve our differences. The Plurinational State of \r\nBolivia is convinced that the International Court of \r\nJustice constitutes one of the best paths to the peaceful \r\nresolution of disputes between States. Bolivia urges \r\nall States to adhere in good faith to its jurisdiction \r\nand its decisions, in keeping with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThis year is of particular interest, given the increase \r\nin the number of cases submitted to and resolved by the \r\nCourt on a diversity of matters, which is a reflection \r\nof the general nature of the competence of the main \r\njudicial body of the United Nations, as well as of the \r\nfact that States put their trust in it. We take note of \r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the Court’s efforts \r\nto make use of new technologies. They contribute to \r\nbetter performance, given the limited time frames and \r\nthe complex cases before it.\r\nWithout a doubt, it is the quality of the Court’s \r\nrulings, its proven independence and its adherence \r\nto international law, to the evidence presented and to \r\njudicial reasoning that represent the main contribution \r\nof great value to the international community of nations. \r\nThe positive evaluation of the Court by the Assembly \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.35\r\n16-34742 5/13\r\ncorresponds to the trust that we, the States, also place \r\nin it for fair procedures and rulings that endure through \r\ntime. Humankind and our countries have taken a \r\nqualitative, extraordinary leap in maintaining peace, \r\nstrengthening the rule of law, bolstering respect for \r\nbasic rights and improving the quality of life on our \r\nplanet by establishing and supporting the Court. Its \r\ndecisions and advisory opinions over the past 71 years \r\nare convincingtestimony to its peaceful and practical \r\nnature and its ability to peacefully resolve conflicts.\r\nBolivia wishes to highlight that the Court still has \r\na long way to go on its path towards great achievements. \r\nPeoples and States bring cases to The Hague with hope \r\nfor justice and reparations, and for reasonable and \r\nfitting agreements, as they search for opportunities for \r\nall parties — opportunities that war, violence and their \r\nconsequences deny the peoples The International Court \r\nof Justice represents, then, a space of hope for peace \r\nand justice. \r\nBolivia understands the scope of the budgetary \r\nrequirements presented in the Court’s report and will \r\nsupport the necessary decisions to meet those needs.\r\nBolivia agrees with the Court in two cases, one as \r\nan applicant and the other as a respondent, both against \r\nthe Republic of Chile. We accept and respect the Court’s \r\njurisdiction and trust that its decisions will contribute \r\nto positively resolving the disputes that separate our \r\ntwo neighbouring and brother nations. As President \r\nEvo Morales said, Bolivia once again declares that there \r\nis only one way to resolve pending issues, and that is \r\nthrough negotiations and peaceful means as established \r\nby international law, \r\nLastly, Bolivia reaffirms its inclination towards \r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts and reiterates its \r\nadherence to the principles of international law and the \r\nprinciples set forth in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIt is not force that brings about law. It is the reason of \r\nthe law that repairs injustices.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): My delegation would \r\nlike to thank the International Court of Justice for its \r\ndetailed report on its work (A/71/4). The Court has \r\nindeed had a very busy and productive year. We would \r\nalso like to extend our warm congratulations to the \r\nCourt on the occasion of the seventieth anniversary of \r\nits inaugural sitting. We have every confidence that the \r\nCourt will continue to grow from strength to strength.\r\nSingapore attaches great importance to the \r\nprinciple of the rule of law at both the national and the \r\ninternational levels. For small States like Singapore, the \r\nprinciple of the rule of law is not an academic notion. It \r\nis a critical precondition for our survival and continued \r\nexistence as independent, sovereign States. \r\nAn integral and indivisible part of the rule of law \r\nis the settlement of international disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans. The Court plays a crucial role in that regard \r\nby providing an effective, established and objective \r\nmechanism for States to resolve their disputes in \r\naccordance with international law. The Court’s role \r\nin resolving disputes and maintaining international \r\npeace and stability cannot be overemphasized. The \r\nInternational Court of Justice is the only international \r\ncourt of universal character with general jurisdiction. \r\nThe Court therefore occupies a special position within \r\nthe international community, from which it is well \r\nplaced to uphold and promote the rule of law. Singapore \r\nhas been and will continue to be supportive of the Court.\r\nSingapore notes that the Court’s workload has \r\ngrown considerably over the past 20 years and that the \r\nnumber of cases brought before it has been increasing. \r\nThe Court has done its best to meet that challenge \r\nthrough the use of new technologies, as well as by \r\nsetting a highly demanding schedule of hearings and \r\ndeliberations. We commend the Court on the level of \r\ncommitment and professionalism with which the Court, \r\nits judges and the Registry discharge their functions. \r\nWe also express our appreciation for their dedicated \r\nservice to the global community.\r\nSingapore also notes the concerns raised by the \r\nCourt in its report regarding the final budget approved \r\nby the General Assembly for the biennium 2016-2017. \r\nAs the principal judicial organ in the United Nations \r\nsystem and one that has discharged its function \r\nresponsibly, the Court should, inour view, enjoy the \r\nfull support of Member States. It is therefore vital that \r\nMember States demonstrate their support by ensuring \r\nthat the Court is given adequate resources to discharge \r\nits role efficiently and effectively.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that Singapore has \r\nalways supported and will continue to support the work \r\nof the Court. We will also continue to monitor with \r\ngreat interest every decision and opinion of the Court. \r\nWe wish the Court every success in the coming year.\r\nMr. Plasai (Thailand) (spoke in French): My \r\ndelegation would like to express its appreciation to \r\nA/71/PV.35 27/10/2016\r\n6/13 16-34742\r\nJudge Abraham for his able leadership as the President \r\nof the International Court of Justice. We also wish \r\nto thank him for his detailed report on the Court’s \r\nactivities of the past year (see A/71/PV.34). \r\nThe Court remains highly active, with 14 pending \r\ncases on its docket. Over the period under consideration, \r\nthe Court has handed down 11 orders and examined two \r\njoint cases. It also held public hearings in five instances \r\nand took on three new contentious cases. The Court \r\ncovers a broad range of issues involving States from all \r\ncontinents.\r\nHere we wish to commend the Court for its \r\nremarkable efforts in the efficient management \r\nof its cases, which involve many procedural steps \r\nwith growing factual and judicial complexity in the \r\nbackground. This year, new cases have been submitted \r\nto the Court relating to the shared use of waters, \r\ndiplomatic immunity and sovereignty. That underlines \r\nthe varied nature of the cases heard and testifies to the \r\nuniversal character of the Court. \r\nThailand has been following with particular \r\ninterest the activity of the Court in various cases, \r\nsuch as boundary disputes, maritime delineation \r\nand the interpretation of treaties and judgments. The \r\nCourt’s latest ruling regarding the two joint cases, \r\nconcerning Certain Activities carried out by Nicaragua \r\nin the Border Area (Costa Rica v. Nicaragua) and \r\nConstruction of a Road in Costa Rica along the San \r\nJuan River (Nicaragua v. Costa Rica), is of particular \r\ninterest to us.\r\nRegarding international environmental law, the \r\nCourt has confirmed and extended its previous rulings \r\non the obligations of States with respect to activities in \r\ntheir territories that could have a negative impact on the \r\nterritory of a neighbouring State. We should note that \r\nthe Court has made reference to obligations stemming \r\nfrom international customary law and international \r\ngeneral law, without drawing a clear distinction between \r\nthe two nor suggesting that they overlap. However, it \r\nwould perhaps be useful to understand the reasoning \r\nbehind the reference to such different sources of law.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThe Kingdom of Thailand wishes to join the \r\ninternational community in congratulating the \r\nInternational Court of Justice on its seventieth \r\nanniversary. We value the Court’s unique role as \r\nthe principle judicial organ of the United Nations in \r\nsafeguarding the purposes and principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the enormous contribution \r\nthat the Court’s impressive jurisprudence has made \r\nto international law. On behalf of the Royal Thai \r\nGovernment, I would like to take this opportunity to \r\npay tribute to all the judges, the Registrar and the staff \r\nof the Court for their dedication and commitment.\r\nInternational law is powerless if States refuse \r\nto uphold it. Over the years, the Court’s intellectual \r\nauthority has greatly contributed to ensuring \r\ncompliance with its judgments. We commend the \r\nCourt’s rigorous process in conducting its deliberations \r\nand reaching its decisions. That has led to increased \r\nconfidence in the Court and in the judicial and peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes in general. We commend the \r\nCourt for duly taking into account the jurisprudence \r\nof other international courts and tribunals and for \r\nmaking efforts to align its rulings with the decisions of \r\nthose bodies, thus ensuring coherence in international \r\nlaw. Accordingly, the Court has played a key role \r\nin strengthening respect for the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level.\r\nIt is essential to preserve the integrity of the Court \r\nby appointing qualified and competent judges and \r\nensuring their absolute independence. My delegation \r\ntherefore wishes to stress the need to avoid adopting \r\na pension scheme for judges of the Court that might \r\ndiscourage the most highly qualified individuals from \r\nstanding for election. \r\nFinally, we wish to comment on budgetary issues. \r\nWhile we recognize the necessity of budget cuts, \r\nwe are of the view that the Assembly should give \r\ndue consideration to the situation of the Court. Its \r\nbudgetary requests have already been modest, and its \r\nproper functioning should not be constrained because \r\nof inadequate funding. We hope that a satisfactory \r\nsolution will soon be found and sufficient support \r\nprovided to that important organ of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Remaoun (Algeria): The International Court \r\nof Justice remains the only jurisdiction that enjoys \r\nuniversality. It acts as a World Court. The Court is \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Charter as its principal \r\njudicial organ. I recall that the document that was \r\nsigned in 1945 in San Francisco is entitled “Charter \r\nof the United Nations and Statute of the International \r\nCourt of Justice”. It therefore enjoys a unique status in \r\nthe international legal framework.\r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.35\r\n16-34742 7/13\r\nThe Court’s work has grown significantly in factual \r\nand legal complexity over the past seventy years. \r\nThe Court has been entrusted with resolving many \r\ncontentious cases from all over the world, involving \r\na wide range of subjects, such as territorial disputes, \r\nenvironmental damage, violations of territorial \r\nintegrity, and the right to self-determination of peoples \r\nunder colonial rule or foreign occupation. Moreover, \r\ndespite the increasing complexity of the cases and the \r\nconsiderable growth in the workload of the Registry \r\nover the past twenty years, Algeria commends the \r\nCourt for its efficient response to those new challenges \r\nand encourages the Court to pursue its efforts to further \r\nstrengthen measures already taken.\r\nIn that regard, Algeria reiterates its full support for \r\nthe Court’s key role in ensuring the implementation of \r\nthe provisions of international law, adjudicating disputes \r\nbetween States and providing advisory opinions to \r\nUnited Nations organs and specialized agencies. \r\nAccordingly, it is important for the United Nations, \r\nparticularly the Security Council, to request advisory \r\nopinions from the Court on legal issues. The high moral \r\nand legal value of the Court’s advisory opinions could \r\ncontribute tremendously to strengthening international \r\npeace and security and the rule of law.\r\nAs Algeria is chairing the First Committee, on \r\ndisarmament and international security, during the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly, my delegation \r\nwould like to reaffirm, as stated this morning by the \r\nrepresentative of the Group of African States (see \r\nA/71/PV.34), the importance of the Court’s advisory \r\nopinion of 8 July 1996 on the Legality of the Threat or \r\nUse of Nuclear Weapons, issued under the presidency \r\nof the Algerian judge, Mr. Mohammed Bedjaoui. In \r\nthat advisory opinion, the Court’s judges concluded \r\nunanimously that\r\n “There exists an obligation to pursue in good \r\nfaith and bring to a conclusion negotiations leading \r\nto nuclear disarmament in all its aspects under \r\nstrict and effective international control.”\r\nTherefore, Algeria calls upon all Member States \r\nto meet that obligation to carry out the process of \r\nnuclear disarmament.\r\nFinally, Algeria would like to underscore that, at \r\nits 2016 session, the Special Committee on the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and on the Strengthening of the \r\nRole of the Organization recommended that the General \r\nAssembly mark the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice through a commemorative \r\ndraft resolution to be adopted during the current \r\nsession. Algeria is honoured to have contributed to that \r\nprocess in its capacity as Vice-Chair of the Special \r\nCommittee and looks forward to the adoption of that \r\nhighly symbolic draft resolution (A/C.6/71/L.16).\r\nMr. Mendoza-García (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Let me start by thanking His Excellency \r\nJudge Abraham for his report (see A/71/PV.34). It is an \r\nhonour for me to participate once again in the annual \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly to consider the report \r\non the work of the International Court of Justice, the \r\nonly international court of a universal character with \r\ngeneral jurisdiction and the principal judicial organ of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the work of the \r\nCourt was once again very intensive. It handed down \r\njudgments in two cases — in which, moreover, Costa \r\nRica was a party — handed down 11 orders, held five \r\npublic hearings, was seized of three new contentious \r\ncases, and followed up on 14 pending proceedings. We \r\nhighlight the fact that cases originate in every continent \r\nand are of the most diverse nature., That is evidence \r\nof the universal character of the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nand the importance that the membership attach to \r\nits decisions.\r\nAs the peaceful settlement of international disputes \r\nis a vital objective of the United Nations, the role of \r\nthe Court in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security and the promotion of the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level is a key one, hence the responsibility \r\nof the United Nations and its Member States to support \r\nthe Court in the fulfilment of its tasks. That support \r\ncalls for the Organization to ensure that the Court is \r\nable to deal efficiently and objectively, with complete \r\nprocedural and judicial independence, with the cases \r\nsubmitted to it. It is therefore vitally urgent to ensure \r\nthat it receives the necessary budgetary resources to \r\nfulfil its mandate, taking its workload into account.\r\nAs a democracy that disbanded its armed forces \r\nin 1948, Costa Rica recognizes international law and, \r\nin particular, the International Court of Justice and \r\nrespect for the rule of law at the international level, \r\nas tools necessary for survival. For my country, it is \r\nof the utmost importance that all States comply with \r\ntheir international obligations vis-à-vis other States, \r\nincluding, of course, the decisions of the Court. We \r\nA/71/PV.35 27/10/2016\r\n8/13 16-34742\r\nadvocate that such compliance in all cases be complete \r\nand in good faith, thereby ensuring peace and justice.\r\nIn that regard, it is important for my delegation to \r\nreiterate how important it is for the United Nations to \r\nconsider options for ensuring follow up on the judicial \r\nrulings, with a view to preventing irregular situations \r\nthat might violate the rule of law. \r\nThe International Court of Justice plays a \r\nfundamental role in promoting the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level. Through its advisory opinions and \r\njudgments, as well as through various activities in \r\nwhich it participates — publicity, easy-access diffusion \r\nof its proceedings through its electronic portal and \r\nvarious academic programmes — the Court also \r\ncontributes to the development of international law. \r\nMoreover, we recognize the role that the Court can play \r\nin meeting the Sustainable Development Goals as an \r\norgan able to prevent the use of force, defend the right \r\nof peoples seeking self-determination, advocate for the \r\nprotection of the environment and recognize human \r\nrights violations.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Court’s seventieth \r\nanniversary of its inaugural meeting on 20 April. Costa \r\nRica accepted the Court’s compulsory jurisdiction in \r\n1973 and respectfully invites States that have not yet \r\ndone so to consider making use of the mechanism \r\nprovided for in Article 36 of the Court’s Statute and to \r\naccept its jurisdiction.\r\nToday, following the commemoration of its \r\nseventieth anniversary, we are confident that the \r\nCourt will continue to work diligently with a view to \r\nresolving the disputes brought before it in an impartial \r\nand fair manner, in accordance with the mission \r\nentrusted to it by Member States through the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. In that regard and in keeping \r\nwith our tradition of respect for the instruments and \r\nbodies of international law, we reiterate once again our \r\ncommitment to abiding faithfully by all decisions of the \r\nCourt, and we reaffirm our full confidence that it will \r\ncontinue to strengthen peace and justice through the \r\nobjective performance of its tasks.\r\nMr. Laassel (Morocco) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, allow me to thank Judge Ronny Abraham, \r\nPresident of the International Court of Justice, for the \r\nCourt’s comprehensive report, contained in document \r\nA/71/4, covering the Court’s activities for the period \r\nfrom 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements \r\nmade by the representative of Iran on behalf of the \r\nNon-Aligned Movement and by the representative of \r\nSouth Africa on behalf of the Group of African States \r\n(see A/71/PV.34), and wishes to make the following \r\ncomments in its national capacity.\r\nOur meeting this year coincides with the \r\nseventieth anniversary of the first sitting of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, which was celebrated \r\nin April. On this occasion, my delegation would like \r\nto present its warmest congratulations to the Court’s \r\nPresident, Vice-President, judges and all those who \r\nhave contributed to the successful work of the Court. \r\nEstablished by the Charter of the United Nations in \r\nJune 1945 as the principal judicial organ of the United \r\nNations, the Court began its activities in April 1946. \r\nSince then, it has played a very important role in \r\ncontributing to the development and interpretation of \r\nthe institutional law of the Organization, including the \r\ninterpretation of the provisions of the Charter. It has \r\nalso contributed to the development of international \r\nlaw through its advisory opinions and judgments.\r\nIts role and relevance continue to be reaffirmed. \r\nStates, in the exercise of their sovereignty and good \r\nwill, use the services of the Court for advice in order \r\nto peacefully settle their disputes, be they bilateral or \r\ntrilateral. The fact that a number of States have asked \r\nthe Court to provide its opinion on a wide range of \r\nsubjects testifies to the universal and multidisciplinary \r\ncharacter of the Court. Indeed, the subject matter of the \r\ncases brought before the Court is greatly varied and \r\nincludes territorial and maritime disputes, the unlawful \r\nuse of force, interference in the internal affairs of States, \r\nviolations of States’ territorial integrity and sovereignty, \r\neconomic rights, international humanitarian and human \r\nrights law, environmental damage and the conservation \r\nof living resources, the immunity of States and their \r\nrepresentatives, and the interpretation and application \r\nof conventions and treaties. \r\nThe Court can also play an important role in offering \r\nincentives for parties to negotiate by administering \r\ntransactional justice, which offers them the opportunity \r\nto settle their disputes themselves. It can be said, \r\ntherefore, that the Court provides an invaluable service \r\nto the parties to a dispute and performs a valuable role \r\nof facilitation and negotiation.\r\nMoreover, under Article 96, paragraph 1, of the \r\nCharter, the Economic and Social Council, Trusteeship \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.35\r\n16-34742 9/13\r\nCouncil, the Interim Committee of the General \r\nAssembly and the international organizations associated \r\nwith them have made use of the Court’s services. As a \r\nresult, the International Court of Justice is the judicial \r\norgan par excellence of the United Nations system.\r\nFor its part, the Court, as the sole international \r\njurisdiction of a universal nature, having a double \r\ncompetence — contentious cases  and consultation— \r\nhas never refused to issue a judgment or an advisory \r\nopinion, as long as the conditions relating to its \r\njurisdiction were met. That has made it the most \r\naccessible and in-demand court in terms of settling \r\ndisputes among States. It therefore plays an essential \r\nrole in the peaceful settlement of disputes and the \r\npromotion of the rule of law worldwide.\r\nAs of 31 July, the Court had 14 cases on its docket. \r\nThree new contentious cases were brought before it \r\nby six States from America, five from Africa, four \r\nfrom Europe, three from Asia and one from Oceania. \r\nThat confirms the universality of the Court, given the \r\ndiversity of the cases and subject matter, and illustrates \r\nthe general nature of its jurisdiction as the principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations. \r\nThat said, after 70 years of accumulated legal \r\nexperience and activity, the Court must now better \r\nequip itself and adapt in order to meet new challenges.\r\nFinally, my delegation appreciates the important \r\nrole played by the Court in the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes and its valuable contribution to the \r\nconsolidation and interpretation of the rules of \r\ninternational law. Hence, it is important to disseminate \r\nthe Court’s work by publishing its judgments, advisory \r\nopinions and decisions so as to inculcate among the \r\nlarger public the values  and principles of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of conflicts, contribute to preventive \r\ndiplomacy and promote the rule of law.\r\nMr. Medina Mejías (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): Venezuela associates \r\nitself with the statement made by the representative of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran on behalf of the Movement \r\nof Non-Aligned Countries (see A/71/PV.34).\r\nMy delegation thanks the Honourable Judge Ronny \r\nAbraham, President of the International Court of \r\nJustice, for presenting the report of the Court (A/71/4). \r\nWe value the positive efforts made by that principal \r\njudicial organ of the United Nations to improve its \r\nefficiency and respond to the increased workload. We \r\nstress the importance of publishing the Court’s report \r\nwith sufficient time to enable States to prepare their \r\ncomments and make contributions in a timely manner.\r\nThe delegation of Venezuela reaffirms the \r\nimportance of respect for international law, including \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, as an essential element for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security. In that regard, \r\nrespect for sovereignty, the right of peoples to self-\r\ndetermination, territorial integrity and political \r\nindependence, peaceful settlement of disputes and \r\nrefraining from the threat or use of force are increasingly \r\nrelevant, especially since those principles are the basis \r\nfor peaceful coexistence among nations.\r\nVenezuela reiterates its commitment to the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes, in accordance with \r\nArticle 2 and Chapters VI and VIII of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Member States have the sovereign \r\nright to choose the most appropriate means of achieving \r\na peaceful solution to a dispute. Similarly, legal \r\nobligations resulting from accession to international \r\nagreements must also be honoured.\r\nBy strengthening international law through its \r\neffective implementation, the International Court of \r\nJustice plays a vital role in promoting the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes among States, pursuant to Article \r\n33 of the Charter of this multilateral Organization. \r\nMoreover, it is noteworthy that the Court in its historical \r\nevolution has adopted broad advisory opinions on \r\nvarious issues with political and legal implications in \r\nthe area of peace and international justice.\r\nVenezuela regrets that almost 20 years after \r\nthe adoption of the advisory opinion on the Legality \r\nof the Threat or Use of Nuclear Weapons, there has \r\nbeen no significant progress in the field of nuclear \r\ndisarmament. The use of that category of weapons of \r\nmass destruction is still part of the strategic doctrine \r\nof the military alliances of certain nuclear Powers. \r\nWe therefore encourage the international community, \r\nespecially the nuclear-weapon States, to pursue their \r\nefforts to negotiate a legally binding instrument \r\nproscribing the threat, use, production and stockpiling \r\nof nuclear weapons.\r\nIn conclusion, we urge strengthened interaction \r\namong the Security Council, the General Assembly \r\nand the International Court of Justice, given that, \r\nwithin the framework of their respective competencies, \r\nthe peaceful resolution of disputes in support of \r\nA/71/PV.35 27/10/2016\r\n10/13 16-34742\r\ninternational peace and security is a common objective, \r\nin keeping with the fundamental purposes of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the desire of humankind.\r\nIn that connection, we believe it would be useful \r\nfor  the General Assembly, other United Nations bodies \r\nand duly authorized specialized agencies if they were \r\nto more frequently request advisory opinions from the \r\nCourt concerning the issues on their agendas with legal \r\nimplications.\r\nMr. Alabrune (France) (spoke in French): The \r\ndelegation of France wishes to thank the President \r\nof the International Court of Justice, Judge Ronny \r\nAbraham, for his introduction of the Court’s annual \r\nreport (A/71/4). The report is excellent and helpful \r\nand confirms the Court’s importance in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes between States. As highlighted \r\nin the list of cases on the docket, the Court has indeed \r\nseen its litigation activity increase over recent decades, \r\nthus demonstrating States’ confidence in the institution \r\nof the Court.\r\nThe decisions of the Court contribute to the easing of \r\nrelations between States and the quest to settle disputes \r\nwhere other means have failed. If the Court’s decisions \r\nare binding on the parties because of the authority of \r\nthe res judicata attached to them, States’ respect for \r\nand willingness to comply with them are a function of \r\ntheir high quality, as references to the Court’s case law \r\nby other national and international courts attest. France \r\ntherefore reiterates its commitment to and support of the \r\nCourt, especially in view of its seventieth anniversary. \r\nThat support is manifested through a contribution to \r\nthe Court’s resources and contributions to the Court’s \r\nwork on the part of French lawyers from the beginning.\r\nFrance may be subject to the Court’s jurisdiction by \r\nway of the many treaties to which it is party. It is also \r\nthe only State to have accepted the Court’s jurisdiction \r\nunder article 38, paragraph 5, of the Rules of Court, at \r\nthe request of another State.\r\nNext year will mark the renewal of one third of the \r\njudges of the Court. In that regard, France would like to \r\nstress the importance of the Court’s composition. The \r\nrepresentation of various world cultures and languages \r\ngreatly improves the quality of the Court’s decisions. \r\nA true balance of the various legal systems forming \r\nthe basis of international law is obtained by way of the \r\nlanguages represented.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to again \r\nexpress to the Court and all of its States members and \r\nstaff, on behalf of France, our gratitude for its work.\r\nMr. Bin Momen (Bangladesh): Bangladesh thanks \r\nthe President of the International Court of Justice for \r\nthe Court’s comprehensive report (A/71/4) detailing \r\nthe pending and increased workload before the \r\nCourt and the measures taken to ensure the Court’s \r\nenhanced efficiency and visibility. We wish to take this \r\nopportunity to once again express our appreciation to \r\nthe Court on the commemoration, in April this year, of \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of its formal seating. That \r\nsolemn occasion was a reminder of the crucial role \r\nplayed by the Court in promoting the pacific settlement \r\nof international disputes, as stipulated by the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nThe photographic display inaugurated at United \r\nNations Headquarters last week provides a vivid \r\naccount of the Court’s contributions over the years, \r\nas the principal judicial organ of the United Nations, \r\nin upholding the rule of law at the international level \r\nand in the maintenance of international peace, security \r\nand justice.\r\nBangladesh believes that the sustained confidence \r\nin the Court felt by the international community is \r\nmanifested through the broad range of subjects and \r\ncases invoked under its general jurisdiction. It is further \r\nreinforced by the Court’s jurisdiction ratione materiae \r\nin the resolution of disputes among the States that are \r\nparty to the more than 300 bilateral and multilateral \r\ntreaties and conventions. The 121 judgments and 27 \r\nadvisory opinions that the Court has delivered to date \r\nconstitute a seminal contribution in the development of \r\ninternational law.\r\nAs a nation with an unequivocal commitment \r\nto the peaceful settlement of disputes, including \r\nthrough recourse to international law, Bangladesh \r\nduly acknowledges the Court’s judgments, advisory \r\nopinions and ongoing work concerning territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty, unlawful use of force and \r\ninterference in the domestic affairs of States, among \r\nother issues. Given our history of resolving outstanding \r\nmaritime and land boundary delimitation issues with \r\nour neighbours through legal and peaceful means, \r\nwe continue to follow with interest the Court’s work \r\non territorial and maritime disputes, as well as on the \r\nconservation of natural and living resources.\r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.35\r\n16-34742 11/13\r\nAs part of our unremitting advocacy for a \r\npeaceful, just and viable solution to the political and \r\nhumanitarian situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories, Bangladesh attaches great importance to the \r\nCourt’s advisory opinion on the Legal Consequences of \r\nthe Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian \r\nTerritory, including in and around East Jerusalem, \r\nwhich continues to pose a formidable obstacle to the \r\nmeaningful resumption of the peace process.\r\nEvery year Bangladesh co-sponsors the General \r\nAssembly draft resolution entitled “Follow-up to the \r\nadvisory opinion of the International Court of Justice \r\non the legality of the threat or use of nuclear weapons”, \r\nas we underscore the importance of commencing \r\nnegotiations in the Conference on Disarmament on a \r\ncomprehensive convention addressing all aspects of the \r\nprohibition and elimination of nuclear weapons.\r\nWe expect that in the course of its judicial and \r\nadvisory work on environmental issues, the Court \r\nwill give due consideration to the issues of climate \r\njustice and loss and damage, as recognized by the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. The Court’s opinions \r\non those issues could be useful for climate-vulnerable \r\ncountries as they continue to seek appropriate responses \r\nto climate-change threats and impacts through effective \r\nadaptation and mitigation measures.\r\nBangladesh recognizes the Court’s need for \r\nadequate resources for ensuring its proper functioning \r\nand urges all Member States to give due consideration \r\nto the Court’s submissions in that regard. We note \r\nwith appreciation the efforts being made to further \r\nupgrade the Court’s visibility online, including through \r\nits website, and to enhance the use of information \r\nand communications technology in tandem with the \r\ngrowing complexity of its work.\r\nBangladesh remains mindful of the General \r\nAssembly’s call upon States to accept the Court’s \r\njurisdiction, in accordance with its Statute. We \r\nthank those Member States that have made voluntary \r\ncontributions this year to the Secretary-General’s \r\nTrust Fund to assist States in bearing the expenses \r\nincurred during the settlement of disputes through the \r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in \r\nFrench): At the outset, I would like to express my warm \r\ncongratulations to the President of the International \r\nCourt of Justice for his very detailed presentation this \r\nmorning in the General Assembly (see A/71/PV.34) \r\nof the report of the Court on its activities (A/71/4). \r\nIts work, much like its work last year, has consisted \r\nof the holding of public hearings on cases and the \r\npublication of its judgments and rulings. Moreover, the \r\ntypes of cases brought before the Court have broadened \r\nand are now extremely varied in subject matter, \r\nsuch as territorial and maritime disputes, genocide, \r\nenvironmental damage, the preservation of biological \r\nresources, the interpretation and implementation of \r\ninternational conventions and treaties, and violations \r\nof territorial integrity, sovereignty, international \r\nhumanitarian law and human rights. The vitality of the \r\nCourt is commendable.\r\nI also pay tribute to the States that have chosen \r\nthe judicial option to settle their disputes. In doing \r\nso, they have opted for the peaceful settlement of \r\ndisputes, instead of resorting to force, thereby placing \r\nthe International Court of Justice at the heart of the \r\nquest for and strengthening of international peace and \r\ncooperation.\r\nAs a beneficiary of the United Nations judical \r\npath, Cameroon can boast of being a model to follow, \r\nas is evidenced by the 10 October 2002 Court ruling \r\nregarding the land and maritime boundary between \r\nCameroon and Nigeria. The implementation of that \r\ndecision is now in its final stage and has resulted in \r\ngreater solidarity between the peoples of Cameroon and \r\nNigeria. I take this opportunity to congratulate once \r\nagain and thank our bilateral and multilateral partners, \r\nwho have worked tirelessly to help us implement that \r\njudgment. That is proof that resort to international law \r\nis the most appropriate path if we are to achieve lasting \r\npeace among nations. I therefore urge all Member \r\nStates that are seeking a legal settlement for their \r\nintergovernmental disputes and conflicts to be inspired \r\nby our success.\r\nPresident Paul Biya has always supported that \r\nmethod of settling disputes. Achieving peace through \r\nlaw, as he has advocated, is possible as long as force \r\nyields to law and States recognize the primacy of \r\ninternational law and the preponderant role of the \r\nUnited Nations in that regard.\r\nThe celebration of the seventieth anniversary of the \r\nInternational Court of Justice on 20 April 2016 was a \r\nsignificant occasion for States and the Court to honour \r\nthe primacy of international law as the best manner of \r\nsettling international disputes. \r\nA/71/PV.35 27/10/2016\r\n12/13 16-34742\r\nFollowing that celebration, Cameroon commends \r\nhow the Court has worked to adapt to recent \r\ndevelopments in international relations. It had \r\npreviously focused almost exclusively on border issues \r\nand now has been able to make the necessary changes \r\nto be able to grapple with new types of matters, such as \r\ncontentious cases related to environmental protection \r\nand property rights. \r\nThe Court’s role is more important than ever \r\nbefore. Indeed, considering the increasing complexity \r\nof legal matters submitted to it, the judges are now \r\ncalled on to advance international law in all areas \r\nof the activities of our States. Cameroon takes this \r\nopportunity to commend the efforts to modernize the \r\nprincipal judicial organ of the United Nations so as to \r\nenable it to contribute to the attainment of lasting peace \r\nand stability amongst States.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to call upon the \r\nCourt, following its anniversary, to envision a reform \r\nmechanism aimed at optimizing its performance. Such a \r\nreform could include increasing the consideration given \r\nto African principles and values in order to enrich and \r\nbroaden the customary sources of international law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly takes note \r\nof the report of the International Court of Justice?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of agenda item 70?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 7 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items\r\nSecond report of the General Committee \r\n(A/71/250/Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\nparagraph (a) of its report, the General Committee \r\nrecommends to the General Assembly that an \r\nadditional item, entitled “Observer status for the \r\nCentral American Bank for Economic Integration in \r\nthe General Assembly” be included in the agenda of \r\nthe current session under heading I (Organizational, \r\nadministrative and other matters).\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to \r\ninclude this item in the agenda of the current session, \r\nunder heading I?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\nparagraph (b) of its report, the General Committee \r\nfurther recommends that the new item be allocated to \r\nthe Sixth Committee. \r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly decides to \r\nallocate this item to the Sixth Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I wish to \r\ninform members that the agenda item entitled “Observer \r\nstatus  of the Central American Bank for  Economic \r\nIntegration in the General Assembly” becomes agenda \r\nitem 174 of the agenda of the current session. The Chair \r\nof the Sixth Committee will be informed of the decision \r\njust taken by the General Assembly.\r\nReports of the Fifth Committee\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): If there \r\nis no proposal under rule 66 of the rules of procedure, \r\nI shall take it the Assembly decides not to discuss the \r\nreports of the Fifth Committee which are before it \r\ntoday.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): \r\nStatements will therefore be limited to explanations of \r\nvote or position. The positions of delegations regarding \r\nthe recommendations of the Fifth Committee have been \r\nmade clear in that Committee and are reflected in the \r\nrelevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that under paragraph 7 of \r\ndecision 34/401, the General Assembly agreed that:\r\n“When the same draft resolution is considered \r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a \r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its \r\nvote only once; that is, either in the Committee or \r\nin plenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote \r\nin plenary meeting is different from its vote in the \r\nMain Committee.”\r\nMay I also remind delegations that, also in \r\naccordance with General Assembly decision 34/401, \r\n27/10/2016 A/71/PV.35\r\n16-34742 13/13\r\nexplanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Fifth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to take decisions in the same manner as \r\nwas done in the Fifth Committee, unless otherwise \r\nnotified in advance.\r\nAgenda item 135\r\nProgramme planning\r\nReport of the Fifth Committee (A/71/545)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly has before it a draft resolution recommended \r\nby the Fifth Committee in paragraph 6 of its report. The \r\nFifth Committee adopted it without a vote.
