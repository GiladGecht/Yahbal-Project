"United Nations A/71/PV.37\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n37th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 31 October 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of His Highness Sheikh \r\nKhalifa bin Hamad Al-Thani, former Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar\r\nThe President: We were informed last week of the \r\npassing of His Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad \r\nAl-Thani, the former Amir of the State of Qatar. The \r\nformer Amir was a visionary leader who oversaw his \r\ncountry’s independence and led it to prosperity and \r\nthe rapid development of its economy. This is a time \r\nof grief for the royal family and the Government and \r\nthe people of Qatar. I would like to convey to them \r\nour deepest condolences and to invite the Assembly to \r\njoin me in observing a minute of silence in honour of \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Khalifa bin Hamad Al-Thani, the \r\nformer Amir of the State of Qatar.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a \r\nminute of silence.\r\nAgenda item 72\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/71/342)\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/71/346 and \r\nA/71/349)\r\nThe President: It is my pleasure to welcome \r\nJudge Silvia Alejandra Fernández de Gurmendi, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court, to the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\n It has been 18 years since countries from every \r\nregion of our world came together in Rome. Bearing \r\nin mind the millions of children, women and men \r\nwho have been victims of unimaginable atrocities \r\nthat deeply shock the conscience of humankind, and \r\nrecognizing that such grave crimes threaten the peace, \r\nsecurity and well-being of the world, they resolved, for \r\nthe sake of present and future generations, to establish \r\nthe International Criminal Court, with jurisdiction over \r\nthe most serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity, in order to put an end to impunity for the \r\nperpetrators of such crimes and thereby to contribute to \r\ntheir prevention.\r\nIn the nearly two decades that have passed since then, \r\nconscience of the international community continues to \r\nbe shocked by the atrocities being perpetrated against \r\ninnocent victims every day. It is therefore imperative \r\nthat we draw on the spirit that led to the establishment \r\nof the Court, in order to strengthen, not diminish, our \r\nresolve to end impunity for the perpetrators of those \r\ncrimes. I particularly encourage States parties to \r\ncontinue to work to promote the effective functioning \r\nof the Court and the universality of the Rome Statute. \r\nThis is a time when we should reflect on the \r\nCourt’s important place in the international system in \r\npromoting the rule of law and protecting human rights. \r\nAnd we should remember that, whatever our status \r\nmay be in relation to the Court, we are all united in the \r\nshared belief that some crimes are so serious that they \r\ncall on our collective conscience to act to put an end to \r\nimpunity for those who perpetrate them. Their victims \r\ndeserve and demand nothing less from us all.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

A new \r\nchapter opened for the Court with its transition to its \r\nnew, purpose-built permanent premises, and we were \r\nhonoured to have Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nspeak at the opening ceremony in April.\r\nI would like to begin my briefing by expressing \r\nmy deep gratitude to Mr. Ban for his unwavering, \r\nprincipled and strong support of the Court throughout \r\nhis term as Secretary-General. I also greatly appreciate \r\nhis dedicated service to the international community \r\nand his enormous efforts in furtherance of peace, \r\njustice, tolerance, the rule of law and the protection of \r\nhuman rights. I would also like to take this opportunity \r\nto warmly congratulate Mr António Guterres on his \r\nappointment as the next Secretary-General. The Court \r\nlooks forward to working with him.\r\nAs always, the Court greatly appreciates the \r\ncooperation it receives from the United Nations. This \r\ncooperation ranges from logistical assistance in the \r\nfield to administrative and personnel arrangements, \r\njudicial assistance and the provision of services such as \r\nthose relating to security, satellite communications and \r\nthe use of conference facilities. In accordance with its \r\nRelationship Agreement with the United Nations, the \r\nCourt reimburses the Organization for the assistance \r\nit receives.\r\nEarlier this year, the Court was pleased to conclude \r\na memorandum of understanding with the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in the Central African Republic, in line with \r\nprevious memorandums concluded with other United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions in order to facilitate \r\nmodalities for cooperation. The memorandum of \r\nunderstanding provides for assistance for all parties \r\nand participants in the judicial proceedings.\r\nThe past year has been very eventful in terms of \r\njudicial developments at the ICC. Three judgements \r\nwere issued since my last report (see A/70/PV.48). Two \r\ntrials were held in their entirety, two are ongoing and \r\nanother is set to start soon. Following convictions, \r\nreparations proceedings are under way in four cases.\r\nIn the situation in the Central African Republic, \r\nMr. Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo was convicted in the \r\nfirst instance for failure to punish or prevent crimes \r\ncommitted by his subordinates. He was sentenced to an \r\n18-year term of imprisonment for rape as a war crime \r\nand a crime against humanity, to be served concurrently \r\nwith a 16-year sentence in relation to murder as a \r\nwar crime and a crime against humanity, and to the \r\nwar crime of pillaging. The Trial Chamber stressed \r\nthat the especially grave nature and consequences \r\nof sexual crimes, particularly against children, was \r\nacknowledged by the States parties in the Rome Statute. \r\nThe Trial Chamber further found that the instances of \r\nrape were exceedingly grave with regard to both the \r\ncultural context and the lasting damage to the victims, \r\ntheir families and communities. Both the judgment \r\non conviction and the sentence are currently being \r\nappealed before the Appeals Chamber. Reparations \r\nproceedings have begun.\r\nThe Court held its first trial in relation to the \r\nsituation in Mali, which lasted only three days, after \r\nthe accused admitted his guilt. Mr. Ahmad Al-Faqi \r\nAl-Mahdi, who used to be a prominent figure of a \r\nsplinter group of Al-Qaida, pleaded guilty to the war \r\ncrime of attacking protected objects, in relation to the \r\ndestruction of 10 buildings of a religious and historical \r\ncharacter in Timbuktu, Mali. He was sentenced to \r\nnine years of imprisonment, and that sentence has now \r\nbecome final since it was not appealed.\r\nIn rendering its sentence, the Trial Chamber held \r\nthat crimes against property are generally of lesser \r\ngravity than crimes against persons. However, the \r\ncrime for which Mr. Al-Mahdi was convicted was \r\nof significant gravity, taking into consideration the \r\nsymbolic and emotional value of the buildings, their \r\nreligious character and the discriminatory religious \r\nmotive invoked for the destruction.\r\nFrom September 2015 to April 2016, the Court \r\nheld its first trial on charges of offences against the \r\nadministration of justice in the Bemba et al. case. On \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 3/28\r\n19 October, the Trial Chamber found the five accused \r\nguilty of various offences against the administration \r\nof justice, including corruptly inf luencing witnesses. \r\nPenalties will be pronounced at a subsequent date. The \r\nverdict is not yet final.\r\nWe have also commenced the first trial in the \r\nsituation in Côte d’Ivoire, against Mr. Laurent Gbagbo \r\nand Mr. Charles Blé Goudé. The two accused are \r\ncharged with the crimes against humanity of murder, \r\nrape, persecution and other inhuman acts allegedly \r\ncommitted during post-election violence between \r\nDecember 2010 and April 2011.\r\nIn the situation in Uganda, Pre-Trial Chamber \r\nII confirmed a total of 70 charges of war crimes and \r\ncrimes against humanity against Mr. Dominic Ongwen \r\nof the Lord’s Resistance Army, in relation to alleged \r\nacts of murder, rape, sexual slavery, torture, use of \r\nchild soldiers and other crimes. The trial is set to start \r\non 6 December. That is a significant development \r\nbecause more than 10 years have elapsed since arrest \r\nwarrants were issued against Mr. Ongwen, Mr. Joseph \r\nKony and others.\r\nIn another new development for the Court, for the \r\nfirst time we have sent convicted persons to serve their \r\nsentences in one of our States parties. Mr. Thomas \r\nLubanga Dyilo and Mr. Germain Katanga both \r\nexpressed preference to serve their sentences in their \r\nhome country, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nand that was made possible through the conclusion of \r\nad hoc agreements with that country for that purpose, \r\nfor which we are grateful.\r\nMr. Katanga’s sentence was concluded during the \r\nreporting period, after a panel of the Appeals Chamber \r\ndecided to reduce it following a mandatory review after \r\ntwo thirds of the sentence were served. The judges \r\nconcluded that there were several factors that favoured \r\nreducing the sentence, including Mr. Katanga’s early \r\nand continuing willingness to cooperate with the Court \r\nin its investigations and prosecutions, the fact that he \r\nhad repeatedly and publicly taken responsibility for the \r\ncrimes for which he was convicted and his expression of \r\nregret for the harm caused to the victims by his actions.\r\nOn 27 January, Pre-Trial Chamber I granted the \r\nrequest of the Prosecutor to open an investigation into \r\nthe situation in Georgia, in relation to crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes allegedly committed between \r\n1 July and 10 October 2008. The Chamber recalled that \r\nits decision had the purpose of ensuring judicial control \r\nover the Prosecutor’s proprio motu power to open an \r\ninvestigation, in the absence of a referral by a State \r\nparty or by the Security Council.\r\nThe Chamber’s decision makes it clear that the \r\nauthorization is not limited to any specific incidents \r\nor alleged crimes, but that it is precisely the purpose \r\nof the investigation to determine which crimes, if any, \r\nmay be prosecuted. Any future prosecution of specific \r\nindividuals would again be subject to judicial control \r\nof the Pre-Trial Chamber, both at the stage of issuing \r\narrest warrants or summons and at the confirmation \r\nof charges.\r\nThe process that preceded the Pre-Trial Chamber’s \r\ndecision provided an early opportunity to give a voice to \r\nvictims in the Court’s proceedings. In accordance with \r\nthe Rome Statute, the Chamber took into consideration \r\nrepresentations on behalf of more than 6,000 victims in \r\nrelation to the proposed investigation. The submission \r\nof these representations was facilitated through a field \r\nmission undertaken by victim-participation experts \r\nfrom the Registry of the Court.\r\nThe Court has continued its work in relation to \r\nits unique mandate to order reparations to victims \r\nfollowing convictions in the Lubanga and Katanga \r\ncases, and it has initiated the reparations proceedings \r\nin the Bemba and Al-Mahdi cases. At the same time, \r\nthe Trust Fund for Victims has continued activities \r\nunder its assistance mandate, which is separate from \r\nthe judicial proceedings before the Court.\r\nTogether with its locally based implementing \r\npartners, the Trust Fund has been assisting victims \r\nin northern Uganda and the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo. It is now also planning expansion of its \r\nassistance activities to four other situations before \r\nthe Court, and the Board of Directors has approved \r\nan initial budget for this purpose. The Trust Fund for \r\nVictims plays a key role in implementing the principles \r\nof reparative justice enshrined in the Rome Statute, \r\nbut to do so effectively, it needs resources. I call upon \r\nall States and other donors to support the Trust Fund, \r\nso that it may expand and sustain assistance mandate \r\nprogrammes and maintain and increase the financial \r\nreserve to complement the payment of Court-ordered \r\nreparations awards.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn total, 10 situations are currently under \r\ninvestigation by the Court, of which 5 were referred \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n4/28 16-35110\r\nto the Prosecutor by the States concerned. On \r\n21 September, the Prosecutor received a new referral \r\nfrom the Government of Gabon concerning the \r\nsituation unfolding in that country since May 2016. \r\nThe Prosecutor is currently conducting a preliminary \r\nexamination to determine whether the criteria for \r\nopening an investigation under the Rome Statute have \r\nbeen met. The Prosecutor is also conducting nine other \r\npreliminary examinations on situations unfolding on \r\nvarious continents.\r\nThe assistance and cooperation of States remain \r\ncrucial to the Court’s ability to fulfil its mandate. \r\nIn accordance with the Rome Statute, States parties \r\nare obligated to cooperate fully with the Court’s \r\ninvestigations and prosecutions. Furthermore, the \r\nSecurity Council resolutions referring the situations in \r\nDarfur, in the Sudan, and Libya to the Prosecutor have \r\nimposed an obligation on the two States in question to \r\ncooperate fully with the Court in the context of those \r\nsituationsand have urged all other States to do the \r\nsame.The cooperation of all States, whether or not they \r\nare parties to the Rome Statute, is essential to enable \r\nimpartialand effective investigations. Access to crime \r\nscenes and all relevant evidence, victims and witnesses \r\nis crucial for the judicial process.\r\nThe Court greatly appreciates the numerous States \r\nthat provide active support. We endeavour to nurture \r\nthese relations through various initiatives, including \r\ncooperation seminars and workshops. There are many \r\npriority areas for the Court, but I would particularly \r\nlike to highlight the continued need for the relocation \r\nof witnesses under threat, assistance with financial \r\ninvestigations and the arrest and transfer of suspects. It \r\nis of great concern that requests for arrest and transfer \r\nissued by the Court remain outstanding with respect to \r\n13 individuals, some of which have not been carried out \r\nfor over 10 years.\r\nImproving the efficiency and effectiveness of \r\nthe Court’s operations remains my main priority as \r\nPresident of this institution. All organs of the Court have \r\nembarked upon reforms to improve its performance. \r\nEfforts made in this regard, including the collective \r\nefforts of judges to expedite judicial proceedings, have \r\nalready begun to produce concrete results in recent \r\nproceedings.\r\nI have just returned from the second judges’ retreat, \r\nwhere we took our reforms further this time by tackling \r\nissues relating to trials as well as the legal representation \r\nof victims. Once again, by analysing and comparing \r\nour experiences, we have identified common ground \r\nand best practices. I am confident that the results will \r\nsoon become visible. In addition, in the context of the \r\noverarching effort to improve effectiveness, the Court \r\nhas made significant progress in developing qualitative \r\nand quantitative indicators to measure performance. A \r\nreport on this progress will be submitted in the coming \r\ndays to the Assembly of States Parties.\r\nWe have also seen recent developments that \r\nare not the work of the Court but do contribute to \r\nstrengthening an effective system of justice based \r\non the Rome Statute. In this respect, I welcome the \r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court \r\nBar Association by the defence counsel and the legal \r\nrepresentatives of victims — an association with \r\nthe aim of reinforcing the independence of counsel, \r\nstrengthening the equality of arms and enhancing \r\nthe quality of justice of the Court. I fully agree with \r\nthese objectives. Professional counsel and an effective \r\ndefence are essential to a fair and efficient system of \r\njustice. In this respect, I urge all States to respond \r\nfavourably to requests for cooperation emanating from \r\ndefence teams participating in ICC proceedings.\r\nSince my last report, we have welcomed a new \r\nmember to the family of ICC States parties. I reiterate \r\nhere my warmest congratulations to the Republic of \r\nEl Salvador for its historic decision to join the Rome \r\nStatute, which is a decision in favour of justice, peace \r\nand global solidarity. I was delighted to facilitate the \r\nprocess personally by participating in detailed technical \r\ndiscussions on the Rome Statute with the Salvadorian \r\nparliamentarians.\r\nI also welcome the accession of Samoa to the \r\nAgreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, bringing the total \r\nnumber of parties to the Agreement to 75. I encourage \r\nall remaining States parties and other interested States \r\nto consider ratifying this Agreement.\r\nFinally, since my last report, six States have ratified \r\nthe Kampala Amendments to article 8 of the Rome \r\nStatue. Eight States have ratified the Amendments on \r\nthe crime of aggression, bringing the total number of \r\nratifications for both Amendments to 32.\r\nOn 26 June 2017, the Amendments on the crime of \r\naggression will have entered into force for 30 States. \r\nThe Court will have jurisdiction over the crime of \r\naggression once a decision is taken by a two-thirds \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 5/28\r\nmajority of the Assembly of States Parties after \r\n1 January 2017 to grant it.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nI would now like to refer to the recent announcements \r\nof withdrawals from the Rome Statute, the founding \r\nTreaty of the Court. In this regard, I wish to reaffirm \r\nthe importance of the continued commitment of States \r\nand the international community to investigating and \r\nprosecuting the most serious crimes and to protecting \r\nvictims across the world. The past two decades have \r\nwitnessed huge progress in the consolidation of \r\ninternational criminal justice as a fundamental part of \r\nthe international community’s response to conflict and \r\nmass atrocities.\r\nIn 1998, the ICC was created by countries with the \r\nsupport of civil society from all continents to investigate \r\nand prosecute perpetrators of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes, by whomever committed. \r\nOver the years, additional States have continued to \r\njoin the Court and contributed to its effectiveness by \r\ncooperating with its activities. In creating the Court \r\nas a permanent and independent judicial institution, \r\nStates recognize the link between justice, peace \r\nand sustainable development and reaffirmed their \r\ncommitment to fighting impunity.\r\nMost recently, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, in particular Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 16, demonstrates that connection. The ICC can \r\ncontribute to the goal of providing access to justice for \r\nall and building effective, accountable and inclusive \r\ninstitutions. The Court was not created to replace or \r\ncompete with States; on the contrary, States have the \r\nduty and indeed the right to investigate and prosecute \r\nthese crimes themselves in the first place. The role of \r\nthe Court is to provide justice only when States fail to \r\ndo so.\r\nSince its creation, the Court has made significant \r\nachievements in addressing crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community as a whole, such as the use \r\nof child soldiers, sexual violence in conflict, attacks \r\non civilians and the destruction of cultural property. \r\nCrucially, the creation of the ICC has given a voice to \r\nvictims by allowing them to participate in the Court’s \r\nproceedings and request reparations. The Trust Fund \r\nfor Victims associated with the Court has already \r\nassisted more than 300,000 victims with physical and \r\npsychological rehabilitation as well as material support.\r\nThe Court is doing its work and has embarked on \r\na number of important reforms to enhance the speed \r\nand quality of prosecutions and judicial proceedings. \r\nThe important results achieved this year are a clear \r\ndemonstration of the Court’s commitment to delivering \r\nhigh-quality justice. \r\nThe work of the Court continues. In order to bring \r\nperpetrators of crimes to justice and protect victims \r\nacross the world equally, it is essential that support for \r\nthe Court remain strong and that States’ participation \r\nin the Rome Statute be maintained and enlarged.\r\nThe President: I thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court for her briefing.\r\nI now give the f loor to the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMr. Vale de Almeida (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union (EU) \r\nand its 28 member States. The candidate countries \r\nMontenegro, Albania and Serbia; the country of the \r\nStabilization and Association Process and potential \r\ncandidate Bosnia and Herzegovina; and Ukraine and \r\nGeorgia align themselves with this statement.\r\nWe would like to thank President Fernández de \r\nGurmendi for her presence here in New York and \r\nfor her comprehensive briefing. We also thank the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for its annual report \r\nto the United Nations (see A/71/342), covering the \r\nperiod from August 2015 to July 2016, detailing what is \r\ndescribed as a particularly busy year for the ICC.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nconsider the fight against impunity for the most serious \r\ncrimes to be critical for creating a fair and just society \r\nby holding the perpetrators accountable and ensuring \r\njustice for the victims. We also believe that peace and \r\njustice are complementary and not mutually exclusive. \r\nWe are strong supporters of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, which is a key institution for helping victims \r\ndealing with the most serious kinds of crimes to achieve \r\njustice when they cannot do so at the national level.\r\nAll perpetrators of such crimes must be held \r\naccountable for their actions, and a key element of the \r\nRome Statute is its equal application. In that regard, \r\nthe establishment of the ICC has given millions of \r\nvictims of atrocity crimes new hope that justice will \r\nbe done. States from all over the world have worked \r\ntogether to make this possible. Our strong policy in this \r\nrespect has a firm institutional foundation in European \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n6/28 16-35110\r\nUnion legislation, which is adjusted to the Court’s \r\nevolving activity.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\ntherefore regret the decisions by the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa and Burundi to withdraw from the Rome \r\nStatute. We also note with concern that the Gambia has \r\nannounced its intention to withdraw. We join Mr. Sidiki \r\nKaba, President of the Assembly of the States Parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute, in inviting these States to reconsider \r\ntheir position. What was right in 1998 is still right. The \r\nworld needs the ICC, and the ICC needs the support \r\nof every country. We would like to continue our \r\nengagement with these countries and with all our other \r\npartners in determining how we can all continue to act \r\nconstructively in furthering the important work of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nThe primary responsibility for bringing offenders \r\nto justice lies with States themselves. Complementarity \r\nis a core principle of the Rome Statute. In order to make \r\nit operational, all States parties have to prepare and \r\nadopt effective national legislation so as to implement \r\nthe Rome Statute in their national systems. Through \r\nvarious assistance instruments and projects, we \r\nsupport initiatives that focus on encouraging States \r\nto cooperate in the fight against impunity for atrocity \r\ncrimes, including through improved ways to provide \r\nmutual legal assistance.\r\nWith 23 cases in 10 situations at different stages \r\nof their proceedings, 11 situations under preliminary \r\nexamination and one new investigation by the \r\nProsecutor, the ICC is once again facing an increasing \r\nworkload this year. It is worth noting that the Court is \r\nnow conducting preliminary examinations and situation \r\ninvestigations in most regions of the world — Latin \r\nAmerica, Asia, Africa and Europe. It remains a hope \r\nfor justice and accountability in situations that would \r\notherwise be hopeless.\r\nA number of States have demonstrated their trust in \r\nthat hope by submitting situations to the ICC. We note \r\nthe important judicial developments as the Court has \r\nfulfilled its mandate, as ref lected in this year’s report. \r\nIn the context of the Court’s increasing workload, we \r\nunderline how important it is to ensure that it functions \r\nefficiently and effectively.\r\nThe universality of the Rome Statute, which \r\ncontinues to be one of the main challenges facing the \r\nICC, is essential to ensuring accountability for the \r\nmost serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity. We will continue to work tirelessly to \r\nmake the Rome Statute truly universal.\r\nOn 3 March, El Salvador deposited its instrument \r\nof accession to the Statute. We hope that El Salvador’s \r\ndecision will encourage ratification processes \r\nelsewhere in the world. We also note that the threshold \r\nof 30 ratifications of the Kampala Amendments on the \r\ncrime of aggression, as provided for in resolution RC/\r\nRes.6 of the Review Conference of the Rome Statute, \r\nadopted in 11 June 2010, has been met this year. During \r\nthe reporting period, the EU continued to engage in \r\npromoting the universality of the Rome Statute and the \r\nAgreement on Privileges and Immunities, as well as a \r\nbetter understanding of the Court’s mandate.\r\nAnother continuing fundamental challenge is the \r\nneed to ensure that States parties cooperate with the \r\nICC and that they do so in accordance with the Security \r\nCouncil resolutions that refer situations to the Court. \r\nWe note with concern instances of non-cooperation, \r\nincluding those that have been referred to the Security \r\nCouncil. We welcome the response of the President of \r\nthe Security Council in December 2015 that decisions \r\nof the Court concerning non-cooperation were brought \r\nto the attention of Council members, and we encourage \r\nthe Council to find ways to improve the implementation \r\nof the obligations created by its two referrals of the \r\nsituations in Darfur and in Libya.\r\nNon-cooperation with the Court stif les the ICC’s \r\ncapacity to deliver justice. We call on all States to \r\ntake consistent action to encourage appropriate and \r\nfull cooperation with the Court, including the prompt \r\nexecution of arrest warrants. We also reiterate how \r\ncrucial it is to ensure that all States refrain from helping \r\nto shelter or hide perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes, and that they take the necessary steps to bring \r\nthose perpetrators to justice in order to end impunity.\r\nWe welcome the efforts of States, international \r\norganizations and civil society to increase their \r\ncooperation with the ICC and their assistance to it. \r\nWe particularly commend the ongoing United Nations \r\ncooperation with the Court, which is detailed in the \r\nreport, both at Headquarters and within United Nations \r\nspecialized institutions and field missions. \r\nOur common goal continues to be the same — to \r\nfurther strengthen the Court so that it can fulfil its \r\nmandate effectively. There are States parties to the \r\nICC all over the world, and they share ownership of \r\nthe Rome Statute. We will continue to encourage the \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 7/28\r\nwidest possible participation in the Statute, support the \r\nindependence of the Court and promote cooperation \r\nwith it.\r\nMs. Beckles (Trinidad and Tobago): I have the \r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\n14 States members of the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM).\r\nAt the outset, we would like to reiterate our \r\nunequivocal commitment to upholding the purposes \r\nand principles on which the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) was founded. We also wish to express \r\nour gratitude to the Secretary-General for the reports \r\ncontained in documents A/71/342, A/71/346 and \r\nA/71/349, which provide useful information on the \r\nCourt’s activities in 2015 and 2016.\r\nCARICOM remains fully committed to supporting \r\nthe Court and its primary objective of helping to put an \r\nend to impunity for the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community, as well as contributing \r\nto the prevention of such crimes, as listed under article \r\n5 of the Rome Statute of the ICC. Within our own \r\nregion, the late Arthur N. R. Robinson, former Prime \r\nMinister and President of Trinidad and Tobago, has been \r\ncredited as one of the forefathers of the ICC through his \r\npioneering work leading to the Court’s establishment.\r\nNotwithstanding its many challenges, the ICC \r\ncontinues to be a beacon of hope to the victims of \r\ncrimes within its jurisdiction who are seeking justice. \r\nThey include thousands of women and children, who \r\nare often most affected by the actions of criminals \r\nwho show blatant disregard for the sanctity of human \r\nlife by violating international humanitarian law and \r\ninternational human rights. In that regard, we are \r\nparticularly pleased to note that the Trust Fund for \r\nVictims provided more than 300,000 people with \r\npsychological and physical rehabilitation as well as \r\nmaterial support. We therefore recognize the ICC’s \r\nimportance in promoting the rule of law, encouraging \r\nrespect for human rights, and achieving sustainable \r\npeace and the further development of nations, in \r\naccordance with international law and the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nCARICOM contends that the success of the \r\nCourt is intrinsically linked to the universality of \r\nthe Rome Statute. We are therefore convinced that \r\nincreased cooperation would improve the Court’s \r\nability to effectively discharge the mandate entrusted \r\nto it by the States parties. In that regard, we reiterate \r\nour commitment to promoting the universality of the \r\nStatute and urge all States that have not yet done so to \r\ntake the necessary steps to ratify and fully implement \r\nit with a view to promoting its universality.\r\nWe welcome the most recent ratifications of the \r\namendments on the crime of aggression, which have \r\nbrought the total to 32. CARICOM recalls the decision \r\nmade in 2010 at the Kampala Review Conference of \r\nthe Rome Statute under which the Court will be able to \r\nexercise jurisdiction over the crime of aggression once \r\n30 States had ratified the amendments, subject to a \r\ndecision by the Assembly of States Parties to activate it. \r\nWe therefore look forward to the Assembly’s decision \r\nin that regard, which will be taken in 2017.\r\nCooperation with the Court remains at the heart \r\nof the Rome Statute and is the duty not only of States \r\nparties but of all States Members of the United Nations, \r\nespecially in cases referred to the Court by the Security \r\nCouncil. In the light of the concerns of some who see \r\nthe ICC’s criminal jurisdiction as a possible threat \r\nto national sovereignty, we would like to recall that, \r\nunder the principle of complementarity enshrined in \r\nthe Rome Statute, the Court’s jurisdiction is invoked \r\nonly when States are unable or unwilling to prosecute \r\nthose deemed guilty of grave crimes of concern to the \r\ninternational community. No individual or State should \r\nfear the ICC, since it is a court of last resort.\r\nPursuant to the report of the Secretary-General on \r\nthat subject, we would also like to recall that, while \r\nthe Security Council’s ability to refer a situation to \r\nthe Court is crucial to promoting accountability, it is \r\nalso essential to conduct active follow-up of referrals \r\nto ensure cooperation — that is, to obtain the arrest \r\nand surrender of individuals — so that effective justice \r\ncan be delivered. We fully agree with the report’s \r\ncontention that perceived inaction on the part of the \r\nCouncil risks undermining both its own credibility \r\nand that of the Court. CARICOM remains deeply \r\nconcerned about some States’ failure to honour their \r\nlegally binding obligations to cooperate with the Court \r\nin the execution of outstanding arrest warrants. Those \r\nwho fail to cooperate with the Court’s efforts to bring \r\ncriminals to justice are contributing to a culture of \r\nimpunity that not only undermines the rule of law but \r\nis also an affront to the victims of grave crimes.\r\nCARICOM commends the Court’s efforts to \r\nensure that justice prevails and that criminals are not \r\nallowed to continue their activity with impunity. We \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n8/28 16-35110\r\ncontinue to be satisfied with the steadfast commitment \r\nand hard work of Ms. Fatou Bensouda, the Prosecutor, \r\nwho continues to discharge her mandate in a manner \r\nconsistent with the provisions of the Rome Statute. We \r\ntake note of the preliminary examinations conducted \r\nin 11 countries and the newly opened investigation \r\nfollowing the Court’s judicial authorization.\r\nMr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nHowever, CARICOM remains concerned about \r\nthe Court’s unprecedented workload, with four cases \r\nsimultaneously in the trial stage and several others \r\nat other stages of their proceedings. To mitigate the \r\nsituation, we reiterate our call for the ICC to be provided \r\nwith the resources that it needs to properly discharge its \r\nmandate. CARICOM also urges States parties that have \r\nnot yet done so to pay their outstanding contributions, \r\nso as to ensure that the Court can discharge its \r\nresponsibilities effectively and efficiently. We also \r\nencourage States to make voluntary contributions to \r\nthe Trust Fund for Victims with a view to ensuring \r\nadequate reparations. Given article 115 (b) of the Rome \r\nStatute and the Relationship Agreement between the \r\nUnited Nations and the ICC, CARICOM would like \r\nto recall here that expenses associated with Security \r\nCouncil referrals should be reimbursed with United \r\nNations funds. To that end, we once again reiterate our \r\ncall for the United Nations to honour its obligation to \r\nmeet the costs associated with referrals by the Security \r\nCouncil to the ICC.\r\nIn closing, I wish to express the unequivocal \r\nsupport of Trinidad and Tobago for the ICC and for the \r\npromotion of the universality of the Rome Statute.\r\nMr. Petersen (Denmark): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the five Nordic countries: Finland, Iceland, \r\nNorway, Sweden and my own country, Denmark.\r\nLet me start by thanking the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) for its annual report to the United Nations \r\n(see A/71/342). I would also like to thank Judge \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, President of the Court, for her \r\nthorough presentation of the main issues in the report. \r\nThe Nordic countries would like to express our sincere \r\nappreciation to the Court for its significant contribution \r\nto the fight against impunity worldwide.\r\nIt is evident that the caseload of the Court has \r\ncontinued to increase. I will now give a few statistics \r\nin that regard. \r\nDuring the reporting period, the Office of the \r\nProsecutor conducted preliminary examination \r\nactivities in 11 situations in Asia, Africa, the Middle \r\nEast, Europe and Latin America, and opened a new \r\ninvestigation into the situation in Georgia, following \r\njudicial authorization by the Court. In total, the Court is \r\ncurrently seized of 23 cases and 10 country situations. \r\nThose numbers and the geographical scope of cases are \r\nunprecedented in the history of the Court. That shows \r\nthat the ICC is truly a global criminal court. During \r\nthe reporting period, the Court also rendered its first \r\nconviction for counts of sexual violence and command \r\nresponsibility, which is an important achievement in \r\nthe quest to bring justice to victims of those atrocious \r\ncrimes. We therefore commend the President, the Chief \r\nProsecutor, their staff and the entire Court for the \r\ndedicated and professional manner in which they carry \r\nout their work.\r\nHolding to account perpetrators and ensuring \r\njustice for victims of the most serious crimes of concern \r\nto the international community are principles shared \r\nby States in all parts of the world. The International \r\nCriminal Court is an essential means not only for \r\npromoting respect for international humanitarian law \r\nand human rights law, but also for advancing post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding and reconciliation with a view \r\nto achieving sustainable development and peace. \r\nWe wish to stress the importance of full cooperation \r\nby States. It is a cause for concern that the number of \r\noutstanding arrest warrants remains high. Requests \r\nfor arrest and surrender issued by the Court remain \r\noutstanding against 13 individuals. States parties have \r\na legal obligation under the Rome Statute to cooperate \r\nfully with the Court. We therefore strongly urge all \r\nStates to cooperate fully and effectively with the Court, \r\nin line with the applicable Security Council resolutions.\r\nThe Court’s promise of justice for the victims \r\ngoes together with the reach of its jurisdiction, which \r\ndepends, first and foremost, on how universally the \r\nRome Statute has been ratified. While being fully within \r\nthe provisions of the Rome Statute, recent decisions \r\nand notifications by States parties to withdraw from \r\nthe Rome Statute are deeply regrettable. The Nordic \r\ncountries continue to stand ready for a constructive \r\ndiscussion about concerns that some States parties may \r\nhave within the framework and fundamental principles \r\nof the Rome Statute.\r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 9/28\r\nStates have the primary responsibility to \r\ninvestigate and prosecute crimes, as the ICC is a court \r\nof last resort. However, States affected by genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes might at \r\ntimes need capacity support so as to be able to initiate \r\ninvestigations and conduct criminal proceedings. The \r\nNordic countries emphasize the value of States parties \r\nassisting each other in developing such capacity. We \r\nremain committed to strong international cooperation \r\nin that area – cooperation that engages international, \r\nregional and national actors in the justice sector, as well \r\nas civil society, so as to further the implementation of \r\nthe principle of complementarity. We stress that States \r\nparties may also benefit from the knowledge and \r\nexpertise of the Court. \r\nOne concrete example of our complementarity \r\nengagement is provided by the Justice Rapid Response \r\nfacility, which is a support mechanism for providing \r\nStates and organizations with rapidly deployable \r\ncriminal-justice professionals trained for international \r\ninvestigations.\r\nWe welcome the ongoing cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the ICC as described in \r\nthe report. Cooperation between the Court and the \r\nSecurity Council should be further enhanced, which is \r\nparticularly true in cases of non-cooperation with the \r\nICC. Cases referred to the Court by the Security Council \r\nalso need strengthened follow-up. The Syrian situation \r\nis reaching a horrible magnitude, and we deeply regret \r\nthat the Council has been unable to refer it to the ICC. \r\nWe strongly urge the Council to continue efforts to refer \r\nthat situation to the Court. Without stronger and more \r\ncommitted action by the Council and States parties, the \r\nsituation will not improve. All those responsible for \r\nwar crimes and other serious international crimes must \r\nbe held accountable.\r\nIn the meantime, the quest for universal adherence \r\nto and implementation of the Rome Statute should also \r\nbe intensified. Justice must be ensured for victims of \r\nmass atrocities in Iraq. We therefore repeat our call upon \r\nIraq to accede to the Rome Statute. We also stress the \r\nneed for all States parties, as well as non-States parties \r\nthat have not yet done so to ratify and fully observe the \r\nAgreement on the Privileges and Immunities of the ICC \r\nas a matter of priority.\r\nThe full realization of the rights of victims is \r\nan important aspect of the continuing success and \r\nrelevance of the Court. We commend the important \r\nwork of the ICC Trust Fund for Victims, which has \r\nsupported more than 300,000 victims in northern \r\nUganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nWe encourage States and other actors to contribute to \r\nthe Trust Fund. The Nordic countries also welcome the \r\nambitions of the Office of the Prosecutor to further \r\nenhance the efficiency of the Court. We especially \r\nwelcome the Prosecutor’s policies aimed at addressing \r\ncrimes against those most vulnerable in important \r\nareas such as sexual and gender-based crimes, and at \r\nprosecuting crimes against children.\r\nDuring the reporting period, the Court also moved \r\ninto its new, permanent premises in The Hague, funded \r\nby the States parties. The completion of the new, \r\npurpose-built building of the Court is a major milestone \r\nfor the ICC as a permanent international institution. We \r\nhope that the Court will make the most effective use of \r\nthe new premises so as to achieve justice for victims \r\nand contribute to the prevention of core international \r\ncrimes. In order for the Court to do so and be able to \r\ncarry out its tasks in the most efficient way, it also \r\nneeds to be properly funded. The Court ś budget will \r\nbe dealt with in the Assembly of States Parties later \r\nthis month, but we wish to underline the worldwide \r\nactivities of the Court, as reflected in the report. It is \r\nour common responsibility to ensure that the Court has \r\nsufficient resources to carry out its important mandate \r\nin a time of strongly increasing demand.\r\nLet me conclude by renewing our pledge that the \r\nNordic countries will remain staunch supporters of the \r\nICC. We are committed to continuing to work for the \r\nCourt’s effectiveness, independence and integrity.\r\nMs. Bird (Australia): The world needs the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. The Court embodies \r\nStates parties’ commitment to hold to account those \r\nmost responsible for the crimes that shock us most, \r\nnamely, genocide, crimes against humanity and war \r\ncrimes. It embodies a commitment that when States are \r\nunwilling or unable to investigate and prosecute those \r\ncrimes, the international community will step in and \r\nprovide justice for the victims. It entails a commitment \r\nto contribute to the prevention of those crimes.\r\nThe ICC is only as strong as the commitment \r\nof the States on whose cooperation and support the \r\nCourt relies. We underline our expectation that States \r\nwill fulfil their obligations to cooperate with the \r\nCourt, whether those obligations derive from being a \r\nparty to the Rome Statute or from resolutions of the \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n10/28 16-35110\r\nSecurity Council. Support from the United Nations \r\nis also crucial. We welcome Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon’s ongoing support for the Court and express \r\nour expectation that the incoming Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Guterres, will follow in his footsteps.\r\nThe support of the Security Council is particularly \r\nimportant, especially in the case of Council referrals. \r\nIt is essential that such referrals be accompanied by \r\nthe Council’s clear demonstration of ongoing political \r\nsupport in order to maximize States’ cooperation with \r\nthe Court and minimize any possible perception that \r\nthe ICC is subject to the Council’s shifting political \r\ndynamics. That accords with Australia’s vision of a \r\nSecurity Council that demonstrates real leadership in \r\nending impunity for serious international crimes.\r\nThe ICC’s mandate is inherently political. Its job \r\nis to hold to account those most responsible, who all \r\ntoo often are among the most powerful. We accept the \r\nreality that the ICC’s mandate is likely to mean that \r\nit will always have more than its fair share of critics. \r\nNonetheless, we do not shy away from acknowledging \r\nthe fact that as this debate takes place today, the Court \r\nfaces more challenges than ever before. Nor do we wish \r\nto ignore the need to work with those States that have \r\nraised concerns. While we recognize that membership \r\nin an international treaty is a sovereign decision, we \r\ntake the opportunity to encourage those States parties \r\nthat have indicated that they intend to withdraw from \r\nthe Rome Statute to reconsider their decision. As we \r\nhave said before and as we have demonstrated with our \r\nactions, Australia is committed to working together \r\nwith all States parties to ensure that the Court is the \r\nstrongest possible institution that we can make it, so \r\nthat we can ensure that the ICC’s vital mandate can \r\nbe fulfilled.\r\nAustralia is convinced that while timing can be \r\nimportant, holding to account those most responsible \r\nfor serious international crimes is crucial to the \r\nestablishment of inclusive and lasting peace. History \r\nhas demonstrated time and again just how difficult it is \r\nto prevent cycles of violence in the absence of justice. \r\nWe must heed that lesson. The ICC, as a court of last \r\nresort, has a critical role to play in that regard. \r\nAustralia once again calls on States that have not \r\ndone so to ratify the Rome Statute in order to send a \r\nclear and universal message to would-be perpetrators \r\nthat Rome Statute crimes will not be tolerated. For \r\nour part, Australia remains deeply committed to \r\nsupporting the Court and doing what we can to advance \r\nour common cause of ending impunity for those who \r\ncommit the most serious international crimes that \r\nshock the conscience of humankind.\r\nMr. Lauber (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nFirst of all, I would like to thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, for presenting the Court’s \r\nreport (see A/71/342) this morning and commend her \r\nand her team for the excellent work that they have been \r\ndoing in the Court, which is at the heart of any progress \r\nthat we have seen.\r\nThe ICC was created for the victims of the \r\nmost serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity as a whole. It works neither for the benefit \r\nof certain States or regions nor to their detriment. The \r\nICC is the centrepiece of the fight against impunity. \r\nWhile States continue to bear the primary responsibility \r\nfor prosecuting criminals, the Court intervenes when \r\nthe national authorities are unable or unwilling to \r\nprosecute those responsible for the most serious crimes \r\nof concern to the international community. The Court \r\ncontributes to ensuring justice to victims when no other \r\ntribunal will do so.\r\nIt is true that the Rome Statute system is a voluntary \r\nsystem. It is the sovereign right of every State to join \r\nor not join in that system. That decision, like any \r\nother, bears consequences. Here, the consequences are \r\nborne not by the political leaders of the world but by \r\nthose affected by conflicts, war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and genocide. The decisions of South Africa, \r\nBurundi and the Gambia to withdraw from the Rome \r\nStatute therefore send a troubling signal. If anything, \r\nthe multiplication of horrendous crimes around the \r\nglobe should prompt us all to engage more thoroughly \r\nin the fight against impunity and certainly not to reduce \r\nthat commitment.\r\nMuch of the criticism against the ICC does not \r\noriginate from the purported f laws of the institution. \r\nIn fact, quite the contrary is true. The Court is rejected \r\nby some because it does, in fact, execute its mandate \r\nsuccessfully. In the past year, success has come in the \r\nform of key judgments that have provided justice for \r\nvictims, ensured the accountability of perpetrators and \r\naffirmed the rule of law. In The Prosecutor v. Jean-\r\nPierre Bemba Gombo case, for instance, the Court \r\nhighlighted that superiors are responsible for the actions \r\nof their subordinates. In The Prosecutor v. Ahmad Al \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 11/28\r\nFaqi Al Mahdi, it underlined that the destruction of \r\ncultural heritage will be punished. Just a few days ago, \r\nthe Court gave the green light for symbolic collective \r\nreparations for the victims relating to the case of The \r\nProsecutor v. Thomas Lubanga Dyilo.\r\nThe ICC can sanction and prevent not only crimes, \r\nbut also wars, which is one of the main goals of the \r\nUnited Nations. The amendment to the Rome Statute \r\non the crime of aggression has now been ratified by \r\nmore than 30 States parties. The Court’s jurisdiction \r\nover such crimes can be activated by the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties starting next year. Having ratified the \r\namendment last year, Switzerland calls on all other \r\nStates parties to do the same. \r\nAlmost two thirds of all of the States represented \r\nin the General Assembly have adhered to the Rome \r\nStatute, and we specifically call on them to uphold the \r\nkey principles that serve as a precondition to the work \r\nof the ICC. First, States parties need to strictly respect \r\nthe independence of the ICC. Politics have no place in \r\na court, either at the national or at the international \r\nlevel. Secondly, States parties need to continue to \r\ninsist that even the highest officials of a State can be \r\nsubject to prosecution before the ICC. Those who plan \r\nand order the commission of serious crimes bear the \r\ngreatest responsibility for them. Finally, States parties \r\nneed to cooperate fully with the ICC, especially in \r\nthe execution of requests by the Prosecutor and arrest \r\nwarrants. States are the limbs of the the international \r\ncriminal justice system.\r\nSwitzerland deplores the lack of action on the part \r\nof the Security Council in relation to the complete \r\nimpunity prevailing in Syria. In 2014, draft resolution \r\nS/2014/348, aimed at referring that situation to the \r\nICC, was not adopted despite the approval of 13 \r\nCouncil members and the sponsorship of 65 States. \r\nToday, we continue to witness the repeated and \r\nsystematic commission of serious crimes by all parties \r\nto the conflict, including the bombing of hospitals, \r\nhumanitarian convoys and besieged cities in which \r\ncivilians live under horrendous circumstances. My \r\ndelegation therefore renews its call on the Security \r\nCouncil to refer the situation in Syria to the ICC. The \r\nright to veto should never be used in situations involving \r\ninternational crimes, whether in Syria or elsewhere.\r\nWe welcome that the United Nations and the \r\nICC have established a close and mutually beneficial \r\nworking relationship on many other levels. That \r\nrelationship encompasses numerous United Nations \r\nentities, including the Department of Political Affairs, \r\nthe Department of Peacekeeping Operations and the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme, as well as \r\nrepresentatives on the ground in Mali and in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic. We also support cooperation between \r\nthe ICC and United Nations commissions of inquiry, \r\ngroups and panels, as well as joint efforts aimed at \r\nstrengthening capacities in national jurisdictions, \r\nso that they can deal with the most serious crimes of \r\ninternational concern. If we want to end impunity, we \r\nmust make it an imperative goal to turn complementarity \r\ninto a reality.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation recalls that the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, proclaimed that \r\nthe ICC heralded an era of accountability based on \r\nthe experience that there can be no sustainable peace \r\nwithout justice. He has devoted himself to making \r\naccountability a reality, and we thank him for that. We \r\nencourage the Secretary-General-designate to pursue \r\nthat same commitment, because much remains to be \r\ndone, and we all have a role to play.\r\nMr. Mikanagi (Japan): At the outset, I would like \r\nto thank President Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for her dedication \r\nand leadership, as well as for her presentation of the \r\ncomprehensive report on the work of the Court (see \r\nA/71/342). \r\nJapan’s core policy towards the ICC is to enable it \r\nto function effectively and sustainably with the support \r\nof the international community. Japan is proud of being \r\nthe largest financial contributor to the Court. We are \r\nalso dedicated to supporting the ICC through capable \r\nhuman resources, including judges, and became \r\nthe first country to participate in the ICC Junior \r\nProfessional Officers programme this year. We hope \r\nthat the programme will enable many junior officers to \r\ngain experience and knowledge at the ICC, while also \r\ncontributing to its work.\r\nJapan believes that the ICC has made steady \r\nprogress in the judicial field. The Court has been \r\nexercising its jurisdiction with regard to 10 situations, \r\nand 10 preliminary examinations are ongoing. \r\nNevertheless, we are cognizant of the fact that financial \r\nand human resources are limited, and we believe that \r\nthey should be used efficiently. With that in mind, \r\nthe Japanese Ambassador to the Netherlands, Hiroshi \r\nInomata, has been working with Chile as co-chair of the \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n12/28 16-35110\r\nStudy Group on Governance to enhance the efficiency \r\nof the Court. We believe that such exercises carried \r\nout by States parties can help mitigate the Court’s \r\nunprecedented workload.\r\nIt is vital for the ICC to have the cooperation of \r\nthe States parties. That is clearly one of the biggest \r\nchallenges that the Court is currently facing. This year, \r\nJapan, together with Australia, the Czech Republic, Peru \r\nand Senegal and in close consultation with interested \r\nparties, prepared a toolkit to assist States parties by \r\nproviding possible actions that can be taken when they \r\nforesee possible incidents of non-cooperation. We hope \r\nthat the toolkit will be useful to everyone and that it will \r\nprevent future non-cooperation issues. Cooperation is \r\nalso crucial when the Security Council refers situations \r\nto the Court. The ICC can function more effectively \r\nwhen the Security Council follows up on such situations \r\nin close cooperation with the Court and the States \r\nconcerned. While there is no clear-cut answer to that \r\nissue, my delegation is happy to contribute to further \r\ndialogue on the matter.\r\nJapan strongly believes that more countries should \r\njoin the ICC to ensure that it effectively promotes the \r\nrule of law throughout the world, In the long-run, \r\nthe ICC should aim at becoming a truly universal \r\ncriminal court, so that it can gain strong support for \r\nits work. In that regard, we are concerned about recent \r\ndecisions that were taken by some African States to \r\nwithdraw from the ICC. In order to gain the support and \r\ncooperation of a greater number of States in carrying \r\nout its activities, the ICC and its States parties should \r\nlisten to the concerns expressed by the wider audience \r\nand make efforts to enhance its universality.\r\nIn closing, I wish to express Japan’s sincere \r\nappreciation for the work that the ICC has accomplished \r\nto date. We hope that it will continue to work diligently \r\nin the fight against impunity while consolidating its \r\ncredibility, both inside and outside the Rome Statute \r\nsystem. Japan pledges to strengthen its contributions \r\nto the ICC and to continue to enhance respect for the \r\nrule of law.\r\nMs. Owen (United States of America): I thank \r\nPresident Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for her presentation \r\nof the Court’s report on its activities (see A/70/342) and \r\nfor her continued leadership as President of the Court.\r\nThe United States has long viewed the end of \r\nimpunity for mass atrocities as both a moral imperative \r\nand a stabilizing force in international affairs. To \r\nthat end, we continue to work with bilateral partners, \r\nregional organizations and the United Nations on a \r\ncase-by-case basis and in a manner consistent with \r\nUnited States policy and law, and with the International \r\nCriminal Court, to identify practical ways to advance \r\naccountability for the worst crimes known to humanity. \r\nAs is so often the case, the past year has seen both \r\nremarkable progress and deeply frustrating setbacks \r\nin that regard, reinforcing how important it is that the \r\ninternational community strive to find ways to intensify \r\nits collaboration in support of justice and reflect and \r\ntake stock of its common efforts.\r\nAs reflected in the Court’s report, there have been \r\na number of successes at the Court with regard to \r\naccountability, demonstrating the many ways in which \r\nit and other courts like it can have an impact. The \r\nUnited States welcomed the conviction in September of \r\nAhmad Al-Faqi Al-Mahdi for destroying mausoleums \r\nand shrines in Timbuktu — a verdict that emphasized \r\nthe seriousness with which the international community \r\nviews the purposeful destruction of cultural property. \r\nWe welcome the upcoming opening of the trial of \r\nDominic Ongwen, who will be the first commander of \r\nthe Lord’s Resistance Army to face charges for his role \r\nin that vicious armed group’s crimes against civilians. \r\nAnd most recently, Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo’s \r\nconviction in March for war crimes was followed \r\njust two weeks ago by a verdict finding him and four \r\nassociates guilty of offenses against the administration \r\nof justice, thereby showing the importance of ensuring \r\nthe integrity of accountability proceedings.\r\nGiven recent developments, it seems appropriate \r\nto note that all of those landmark actions occurred \r\nin situations in which the ICC acted at the request \r\nof a national Government that was unable itself to \r\ninvestigate, bring charges and help vindicate the rights \r\nof victims. We welcome the report of continued work \r\nby peacekeeping missions authorized by the Security \r\nCouncil to support appropriate national efforts to pursue \r\njustice and accountability, as well as the continued \r\nwork by UN-Women, the Special Representative of the \r\nSecretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict and \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor of the ICC to ensure that \r\nsexual and gender-based violence receives the attention \r\nand the focused effort towards accountability that it too \r\nrarely receives.\r\nWe have seen a number of countries take the \r\npositive step of leading the pursuit of justice within \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 13/28\r\ntheir domestic systems, with support from the \r\ninternational community, including the completion \r\nin Senegal of proceedings against Hissène Habré for \r\ncrimes committed during his tenure as President of \r\nChad, and the establishment by the Government of \r\nKosovo of the Kosovo Specialist Chambers in that \r\ncountry’s judiciary, which will examine allegations of \r\nserious crimes committed from 1998 to 2000.\r\nSimilarly, we support the prompt establishment of \r\nthe Hybrid Court for South Sudan, which we hope can \r\nbe an effective measure for ending the cycle of impunity \r\nin that country and provide a measure of justice to \r\nthe victims of the brutal conflict there. Finally, the \r\nCentral African Republic has welcomed the ICC as an \r\nessential ally in the fight against impunity, working \r\nalongside Central African Republic’s domestic efforts \r\nto establish a special criminal court focused on atrocity \r\ncrimes — a process that we urge them to complete as \r\nquickly as possible, given the importance of providing \r\naccountability and bolstering capacity at the national \r\nlevel, even where the ICC is already involved.\r\nAs we reflect on recent events, we should think \r\nabout the ways in which such efforts, both within and \r\nwithout the ICC, have meaningfully and positively \r\ncontributed to breaking cycles of conflict and impunity. \r\nYet, while many of those developments are encouraging, \r\nwe remain alarmed by the continuing suffering in far \r\ntoo many situations elsewhere in the world, where the \r\nvictims of mass atrocities still have not seen a sufficient \r\nresponse to calls for justice. We must remain vigilant \r\nand steady in our march toward a world increasingly \r\nintolerant of impunity.\r\nClearly, there remains much to be done in our work \r\ntogether to prevent mass atrocities and bring to justice \r\nthose who commit crimes against humanity, war crimes \r\nand genocide. The ICC cannot grapple with every mass \r\natrocity situation in the world, and even where it is \r\ninvolved, the Court will be able to address at most only \r\na small handful of cases. Given that reality and the \r\nlimited resources and increasing demands that it faces, \r\nit will be important for the ICC to ensure that its choices \r\nare guided by justice, rigour, fairness and care. In that \r\nconnection, the international community should strive \r\nto ensure that the Court is able to remain focused on its \r\ncore mandate: to address war crimes, crimes against \r\nhumanity and genocide.\r\nWe note in that regard that the United States \r\ncontinues to have serious concerns about the Rome \r\nStatute amendments on the crime of aggression adopted \r\nin 2010 at Kampala. We believe that it is in the interest \r\nof both peace and justice to ensure that any decision \r\nto activate the Court’s jurisdiction over that crime be \r\npreceded by concrete steps to provide greater clarity \r\nregarding certain critical issues, including regarding \r\nwhat conduct and which States would be covered by the \r\namendments. We continue to believe that a decision to \r\nactivate the amendments without clarification of those \r\nissues will further chill the willingness of States to \r\ntake action aimed at stopping the very atrocities that \r\nprompted the Court’s creation, and will compound \r\nthe challenges already facing the Court by enmeshing \r\nit in disputes of a far more political character than it \r\ncurrently faces. On that and other issues of justice \r\nand accountability, we look forward to continuing to \r\npursue partnership and seek common ground with \r\nGovernments and civil society, wherever possible.\r\nMr. Van Bohemen (New Zealand): I begin by \r\nthanking my friend and colleague, Judge Silvia \r\nFernández of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\nfor presenting the report on the work of the Court (see \r\nA/71/342) and for her ongoing service to the Court. \r\nWe welcome the opportunity for continued dialogue \r\nto discuss the Court’s contribution to international \r\ncriminal justice and its relationship with the United \r\nNations. New Zealand has been a long-standing \r\nsupporter of efforts to break the cycle of impunity \r\nfor the most serious international crimes, regardless \r\nof where they occur. For that reason, New Zealand is \r\nand remains a strong supporter of the Court and of the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute.\r\nNew Zealand has also been ready to express \r\nits concerns when we have felt that the Court could \r\nperform better in managing some of the issues facing it. \r\nAs we reflect on the past year, we note that there have \r\nbeen some positive milestones for the Court, to which \r\nI will return later. But first, we should not shy away in \r\nour annual debate this year from the very significant \r\nrecent developments that confront us.\r\nMembers will be aware that New Zealand has \r\nconsistently underlined that the Court and the States \r\nparties must be more open to constructive dialogue \r\nand engagement among the Court, Member States, the \r\nUnited Nations and regional organizations, including \r\nthe African Union. That is why we welcomed the recent \r\nefforts undertaken by His Excellency Mr. Sidiki Kaba, \r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n14/28 16-35110\r\nStatute of the ICC, and Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda of \r\nthe Court in that regard.\r\nWe have long encouraged better engagement with \r\nthe African Union and African States on issues that we \r\nunderstand are of real concern to them and which, \r\nin our view, merit careful consideration. African \r\nStates have played an essential role in the Court since \r\nits inception and have been, through their referrals, \r\nactively engaged with the Court. So that is the context in \r\nwhich we must record our disappointment that Burundi, \r\nSouth Africa and the Gambia have taken the decision \r\nto withdraw from the Rome Statute. In our view, those \r\ndecisions are regrettable. We hope that in the time that \r\nremains before those decisions take effect, there is \r\nroom for meaningful dialogue on a potential resolution \r\nof the issue and for working out a pathway back to full \r\nmembership in the Court. That will necessarily involve \r\na willingness to explore the issues through genuine \r\nengagement. Those issues are inherently difficult and \r\nrequire a commitment by all sides to listen carefully to \r\neach others’ perspectives, which will be an important \r\nprerequisite to any progress.\r\nAt the same time we must not panic. It was always \r\nlikely that there would be teething problems with the \r\nCourt, the need for which had been debated for over \r\n50 years, and especially at a time when the world is \r\nexperiencing some of the most difficult political \r\ntensions since the end of the Cold War. We need to take \r\nthe challenges seriously and recognize the political \r\nrealities in which the Court operates.\r\nThe Court was the creation of a diplomatic process, \r\nand we will need a diplomatic process to address the \r\nchallenges that it is now facing. The task is to do that \r\nin a way that preserves the integrity of and support for \r\nthe Court, which will be essential for its growth and \r\nongoing viability in the international criminal-justice \r\nframework. It also requires from the States parties \r\nmore meaningful engagement than we have seen \r\nto date to acknowledge and address the underlying \r\nconcerns. We particularly urge other States parties to \r\ncontinue the discussions at and around the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties.\r\nNew Zealand remains committed to working with \r\nall States parties to create the conditions necessary for \r\nsuch a dialogue to take place — a dialogue that is open, \r\nhonest, respectful and focused on our common goal of \r\nending impunity. We are conscious that achieving that \r\ngoal will include cooperation and mechanisms at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels. \r\nWe also want, of course, to acknowledge the more \r\npositive developments that have occurred over the past \r\nyear. We welcome the move to the new purpose-built \r\npremises, the thirtieth ratification of the Kampala \r\namendments on the crime of aggression and the first \r\nconviction for the war crime of the destruction of \r\ncultural property in Mali.\r\nBut as we have explained earlier, we cannot ignore \r\nthe challenges ahead, nor can we expect them to be \r\nresolved quickly. It remains imperative to continue \r\nto strengthen the practical working relationships \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations at all levels. \r\nIn particular, we encourage greater cooperation, \r\ncoordination and information-sharing with United \r\nNations sanctions committees. Targeted sanctions are \r\nan important tool for addressing threats to international \r\npeace and security, including the commission of serious \r\ninternational crimes.\r\nAs a member of the Security Council, New Zealand \r\nemphasizes that the relationship between the Court and \r\nthe Security Council remains as important as ever. \r\nAs previously expressed by my delegation, when the \r\nCouncil refers a situation to the Court, it should do \r\nso with a clear commitment to follow up. We believe \r\nthat it is not just a question of providing the Court with \r\nthe necessary support and resources for the referrals \r\nthat the Council makes, including in relation to the \r\nCourt’s findings of non-cooperation, but of upholding \r\nthe binding nature of Chapter VII resolutions. The \r\nfailure to take action calls into question the authority \r\nof the Council and its resolutions. Equally, as we have \r\npreviously said, the Council must be scrupulously \r\ncareful to avoid using referrals as a political tool in the \r\nmidst of a conflict. That only politicizes the Court and \r\ncan prolong both conflicts and impunity.\r\nOur experience on the Council over the past 22 \r\nmonths has only reinforced our view that a robust \r\ninternational accountability framework is essential. \r\nThe existence of the Court sends a clear message that \r\nthe crimes specified in the Rome Statute will not be \r\ntolerated and will not go unpunished. We believe that \r\nthat objective is common to all of us. For our part, New \r\nZealand remains committed to working with others \r\nto strengthen the Court’s effectiveness in fulfilling \r\nits mandate.\r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 15/28\r\nMr. Racovita (Romania): The Romanian delegation \r\nwould like to thank the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) for the twelfth annual report on its activities (see \r\nA/71/342), submitted to the United Nations.\r\nat the outset, let me reiterate Romania’s full \r\ncommitment toand support for the Court as the \r\nfundamental pillar of international criminal justice. \r\nThe International Criminal Court plays a vital part in \r\npreventing the most serious crimes of global concern, \r\nprosecuting the alleged perpetrators of those crimes \r\nand securing the rule of law at the international level.\r\nAs highlighted in the report, the Court faced a \r\nheavy workload over the past year, illustrated, inter alia, \r\nby the need to handle four cases simultaneously at trial \r\nand several other cases at various stages of proceedings, \r\nby the opening of a new investigation on the situation \r\nin Georgia and by the handing down of sentences this \r\nyear for crimes within its jurisdiction. We welcome the \r\nmove to the new permanent premises, which marks \r\nan important milestone for the International Criminal \r\nCourt as a permanent international institution.\r\nWith regard to universality, we commend El \r\nSalvador for depositing its instrument of accession to \r\nthe Rome Statute, thereby raising the number of States \r\nparties to 124. We continue to encourage all States to \r\nbecome parties to the Rome Statute. The Romanian \r\ndelegation equally welcomes the fulfilment of one of the \r\nconditions necessary for the activation of the Court’s \r\njurisdiction with regard to the crime of aggression, as \r\nmore than 30 States have already ratified the relevant \r\nKampala amendment.\r\nWe express our deep concern with respect to the \r\nannounced decisions or intentions to withdraw from \r\nthe Rome Statute expressed by several States parties. \r\nWhile fully acknowledging that withdrawal from an \r\ninternational treaty is a sovereign right, we encourage \r\nthose States to reconsider their position, to continue to \r\nbe part of the Rome Statute system and to work together \r\ntowards reaching its goal of fighting impunity, which \r\nis vital to making reconciliation and lasting peace \r\npossible. Giving up the Statute of Rome system can \r\nonly give the wrong message to civil society, and to \r\nthe victims in particular, that accountability counts \r\nless. That certainly is the wrong message, a message \r\nthat we wanted to correct when we all were engaged \r\nin negotiating the Rome Statute. The very rationale of \r\nthis ambitious project is just as present now, if not more \r\nso, as it was then. We must equally take into account \r\nthe fact that a significant number of situations under \r\ninvestigation at the ICC were submitted by national \r\nauthorities themselves, thereby illustrating confidence \r\nin the institution.\r\nAlong with the challenge affecting universality, the \r\nInternational Criminal Court still faces the challenge \r\nof cooperation. Non-cooperation as regards the \r\nexecution of arrest warrants undermines the capacity \r\nof the Court to deliver justice and affects the credibility \r\nof the justice act. Each State should be aware of the \r\nsignificant role played in the materialization of the \r\ninternational judicial act, in accordance with the legal \r\nobligations stemming from the Rome Statute and/or \r\nSecurity Council resolutions.\r\nRomania remains an active supporter of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and works constantly \r\nto promote its activity. In March 2016, the Court \r\norganized, in Bucharest, with the support of the \r\nRomanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a high-level \r\nregional seminar on strengthening cooperation with the \r\nICC. The event was organized with the financial support \r\nof the European Commission. The aim of the high-level \r\nseminar was to foster cooperation between the ICC and \r\ncountries belonging to the Eastern European Group \r\nof States. It covered a number of important issues, \r\nincluding witness protection, State cooperation during \r\nICC investigations, national capacity-building, various \r\ntypes of voluntary agreements and implementing \r\nlegislation, as well as the benefits of joining the Rome \r\nStatute system. The event brought together Government \r\nrepresentatives from around 20 countries belonging to \r\nthe Eastern European Group of States, including the \r\nMinisters of Justice from Romania and Georgia, along \r\nwith officials from regional organizations and from \r\nthe ICC.\r\nAt the end of the meeting in Bucharest, a set of \r\nrecommendations was adopted in order to promote \r\ncooperation with the ICC, highlighting the most \r\nrelevant issues related to effective cooperation between \r\nthe ICC and Central and Eastern European States and \r\nreflecting the continued commitment within the region \r\nto promoting the work of the Court and its values.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to underline again the \r\nneed for strong, wide and consolidated support from \r\nStates and from the international community for the \r\nICC. When we stand together, that unique and essential \r\ninstitution can achieve the goals of peace and justice.\r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n16/28 16-35110\r\nThe Romanian delegation fully aligns itself with \r\nthe statement delivered on behalf of the European \r\nUnion and its member States.\r\nMr. Cardi (Italy): Let me thank the President of \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, for her thoughtful presentation \r\nof this year’s report of the Court (see A/71/342) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly, which shows the increase in the \r\nvolume of work facing the Court and the increased \r\neffectiveness of its proceedings.\r\nItaly aligns itself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe observer of the European Union. I would like to \r\nemphasize only a few points in my national capacity.\r\nFirst of all, we share the positions of concern and \r\nregret expressed by the Secretary-General and by the \r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, Minister \r\nSidiki Kaba of Senegal, on the recent decisions or \r\nannouncements of intention to withdraw from the \r\nStatute. The Rome Statute represents a cornerstone in \r\nthe fight against impunity and the establishment of an \r\nage of accountability. As the Government of Botswana, \r\ninter alia, stated, as the only permanent international \r\ncriminal tribunal, the ICC is an important and unique \r\ninstitution in the international criminal justice \r\nsystem. It took over 50 years, as we know, for the \r\ninternational community to come together in Rome in \r\n1998 and finalize that ambitious treaty, inspired by the \r\nfundamental principles of international justice, which \r\nmust be preserved.\r\nSecondly, in my role as Vice-President of the \r\nAssembly of States Parties to the ICC Statute, I am \r\nalso proud to work side by side with the President of \r\nthe Assembly of States Parties in his effort to pursue \r\ndialogue while preserving the important principles \r\nembodied in the Rome Statute. Any issue pertaining \r\nto the functioning of the Rome Statute system can \r\nbe addressed in the Assembly of States Parties as the \r\nproper and appropriate platform for States parties to \r\naddress any concerns that they may have regarding the \r\nimplementation of the Statute itself. We have been, we \r\nare and we remain open to dialogue.\r\nOf course, our focus must remain on the victims. For \r\nthat reason, it is very important that the international \r\ncommunity increase its efforts to uphold the concept \r\nof complementarity. The International Criminal Court \r\nis a court of last resort. What we would like to see is \r\na stronger capacity at the national level to prosecute \r\ncrimes and defend the victims. That can be done by \r\nenhancing the role of various United Nations bodies and \r\nwilling Member States in providing technical assistance \r\nto strengthen national judicial systems, especially in \r\ncountries transitioning from war or conflict.\r\nTogether, we must make further progress in the \r\nfight against impunity, for example, as the Court has \r\nshown already with regard to crimes committed by the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham or Daesh, including \r\nby supporting efforts to prosecute crimes against \r\nwomen and children, atrocities against members of \r\nprotected groups and minorities, and crimes involving \r\nthe destruction of the cultural heritage, and, hopefully, \r\nby promoting the opening of new avenues for the \r\nprosecution of traffickers of human beings.\r\nItaly therefore joins other States in calling on all \r\nStates parties to remain committed to the Rome Statute \r\nand on all States to contribute to the prevention and \r\npunishment of crimes against humanity.\r\nMr. Barros Melet (Chile) (spoke in Spanish): We \r\nwould first like to thank the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court, Judge Silvia Alejandra Fernández de \r\nGurmendi, for presenting the comprehensive report \r\non the Court’s activities (see A/71/342) covering the \r\nperiod from 1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016, which \r\nshows, among other things, the significant increase \r\nin the Court’s workload. We acknowledge the First \r\nVice-President, Judge Joyce Aluoch, and the Second \r\nVice-President, Judge Kuniko Ozaki, as well as the \r\nProsecutor, Ms. Fatou Bensouda.\r\nThe International Criminal Court has become \r\nthe most advanced example of the development of \r\ninstitutions devoted to international criminal justice. \r\nFrom the viewpoint of the protection of human rights, \r\nthe creation of the Criminal Court is a decided advance \r\nin efforts to combat impunity and a clear signal that its \r\nStates parties have a commitment to the international \r\ncommunity, which they must honour in order to meet \r\nits objectives.\r\nOn 23 September, Chile deposited its instrument \r\nof ratification of the Kampala amendments, becoming \r\nthe thirty-second State to do so. Nevertheless, \r\nmuch remains to be done, which is why my country \r\nis working to ensure that, after 1 January 2017, \r\nthe necessary decisions are taken to activate the \r\njurisdiction of the Court over crimes of aggression. \r\nIn addition, at home, the Government has supported \r\nthe relevant legal changes so as to include the crime \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 17/28\r\nof aggression in Chilean criminal law and extend the \r\nwar crimes mentioned in the Kampala amendments to \r\nnon-international conflicts.\r\nWe reiterate the importance of ensuring that the \r\nCourt has the necessary material and human means \r\nand resources to fulfil its mandate. In that connection, \r\nChile believes that, when the Security Council refers \r\na situation to the International Criminal Court, \r\nthe General Assembly must make the necessary \r\narrangements to give the Court the financial resources \r\nneeded to deal with such referrals.\r\nWe are also convinced of the need for the Security \r\nCouncil to monitor the cases that it refers to the Court \r\nand, in that connection, to pay special attention to \r\nsituations created by the lack of cooperation by States \r\nor the difficulties that may arise as a result. The \r\nInternational Criminal Court will not be able to advance \r\nits crucial work to combat impunity without proper \r\ncooperation, which is needed so that the perpetrators \r\nof crimes within the Court’s jurisdiction can be held \r\naccountable for their actions. We appeal to all States to \r\ncooperate fully with the Court.\r\nWe shall not let up in our efforts to achieve the \r\nuniversality and full application of the Rome Statute. \r\nWe appeal to the States that are not yet parties to the \r\nStatute to ratify or accede to it. We welcome El Salvador \r\nas a new State party, which brings the number of States \r\nparties to this international treaty to 124. We also \r\nappeal for greater cooperation between the Court and \r\nStates, and in particular those that may be experiencing \r\ndifficulties in that regard, so that they can face, in a \r\ntimely manner and in accordance with the norms of the \r\nRome Statute, any difficulty that they may encounter \r\nin meeting the obligations established therein. We also \r\nemphasize the importance of States parties ratifying \r\nthe Kampala amendments concerning the crime of \r\naggression and article 8 of the Rome Statute.\r\nWith regard to the Trust Fund for Victims, we \r\nacknowledge the important work that has allowed \r\nfor ongoing assistance to over 300,000 victims in the \r\nreporting period, through the provision of physical \r\nand psychological rehabilitation services and material \r\nsupport for the survivors of crimes within the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction.\r\nI reiterate my country’s support for the International \r\nCriminal Court and our desire to ensure that it has \r\nthe necessary means to achieve its objectives and \r\nthat all the members of the international community \r\nrecognize it as a solid and legitimate institution in \r\ncombating impunity.\r\nMr. Grant (Canada) (spoke in French): At the \r\noutset, I would like to reiterate Canada’s continuing \r\nsupport for the International Criminal Court and the \r\npivotal role that it plays in ensuring accountability \r\nfor those responsible for the commission of the most \r\nserious crimes of international concern.\r\nWe must not forget the thousands of children, \r\nwomen and men who have been victims of unimaginable \r\natrocities. As members of the international community, \r\nwe have a collective duty to those victims to support \r\nefforts to ensure that the perpetrators of those crimes \r\nare held to account. It is the duty of every State to \r\nprosecute within its jurisdiction those responsible for \r\nserious international crimes. If States are unwilling or \r\nunable to do so, international mechanisms may fill the \r\ngaps and serve as courts of last resort. \r\nAs such a court of last resort, the International \r\nCriminal Court seeks to complement — not \r\nreplace — national courts, but, in turn, it challenges \r\nStates to engage in effective and meaningful \r\ninvestigations and prosecutions in providing justice \r\nto victims. A majority of Member States are already \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court. However, we remain some distance \r\nfrom achieving the full universalization of the Rome \r\nStatute. Canada calls upon those States that have not \r\nyet done so to consider acceding to the Rome Statute.\r\nIt is well known that the Court cannot effectively \r\naccomplish its mandate without the necessary \r\ncooperation from States parties and others. Over the \r\npast year we have witnessed both accomplishments \r\nand challenges in the sphere of cooperation. The recent \r\nhistoric guilty plea and conviction of Mr. Al-Mahdi \r\nfor war crimes related to the destruction of UNESCO-\r\nprotected shrines in Timbuktu would not have been \r\npossible without the cooperation of the Niger and Mali. \r\nWe welcome their cooperation as a concrete example of \r\nthe commitment of those two States to justice.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe remain troubled, however, by instances of \r\nnon-cooperation, particularly by States parties to the \r\nRome Statute. The fact that arrest warrants issued years \r\nago — including those issued pursuant to referral to the \r\nCourt by the Security Council — remain unexecuted \r\nshould be disturbing to all of us as members of the \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n18/28 16-35110\r\ninternational community. We encourage all States to \r\nabide by their international commitments.\r\nCanada is troubled by the recent decisions of \r\nBurundi and South Africa to withdraw from the \r\nInternational Criminal Court and by the announcement \r\nby the Gambia of its intention to withdraw. We urge \r\nthose three countries to reconsider their actions. \r\nAfrican States played an important role in both the \r\nestablishment and the development of the Court. Today \r\ntheir steadfast support is more important than ever in \r\nthe fight against impunity. \r\nCanada is of the view that the Assembly of States \r\nParties to the Rome Statute is the most appropriate \r\nvenue for States parties to raise any concerns they have \r\nregarding the implementation of the Statute. It is our \r\nhope that States parties will use the upcoming session \r\nof the Assembly in The Hague as an opportunity for \r\nconstructive discussion in that regard.\r\nAs Secretary-General Kofi Annan said in Rome in \r\n1998, the establishment of the Court is a gift of hope \r\nto future generations and a giant step forward in the \r\nmarch towards universal human rights and the rule of \r\nlaw. Building on the legacy of Nuremburg and following \r\nthe lead of the ad hoc tribunals for Rwanda and the \r\nformer Yugoslavia, a permanent international criminal \r\ncourt took concrete form with the Rome Conference. \r\nThe International Criminal Court is the culmination of \r\nthe international community’s dedication to fighting \r\nimpunity and giving a voice to the victims of atrocity \r\ncrimes. \r\nThe Rome Statute embodies the lessons we have \r\npainfully learned from history: that individuals must \r\nbe held to account to deter future crimes, that no one is \r\nabove the law, that it is in the interests of all to ensure that \r\nthose responsible for the gravest crimes are punished, \r\nand that fair and legitimate criminal accountability \r\nprocesses can help to lay the groundwork for lasting \r\npeace. As States parties, we have committed ourselves \r\nto those ideals.\r\nLooking forward, Canada expects that the upcoming \r\nfifteenth session of the Assembly of States Parties will \r\nbe fruitful and will allow us to move forward with \r\nstrengthening the Court’s role. We expect there to be \r\ndiscussions on the administrative issues of budget and \r\ngovernance. In that respect, we underline the important \r\nrole of the Assembly of States Parties in providing \r\noversight and guidance on these matters as prescribed \r\nby the Rome Statute, without, however, unnecessary \r\npoliticization or micromanagement. The Court and \r\nthe Assembly must continue to constructively work \r\ntogether to achieve our common goal of establishing, \r\nmaintaining and strengthening the framework of a \r\npermanent, independent judicial institution that has the \r\nrespect and confidence of the international community.\r\nMr. Imnadze (Georgia): Georgia aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by the observer of the European \r\nUnion. In my national capacity. I would like to make \r\nthe following statement.\r\nAt the outset, let me thank the President of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC), Ms. Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, for the report on the activities \r\nof the Court (see A/71/342) and her remarks on the \r\nfuture of international criminal justice. We also thank \r\nthe President of the Assembly of States Parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute, Mr. Sidiki Kaba, for his role and \r\nleadership in this critical period.\r\nThe report before us covers several important \r\nmilestones, including the groundbreaking case in \r\nprosecuting crimes of sexual violence in conflict \r\nthrough the international justice system. We welcome \r\nthe decision of El Salvador to accede to the Rome \r\nStatute, thereby becoming the one hundred and twenty-\r\nfourth State party. At the end of the reporting period, \r\nthe amendment to article 8 and the amendments on the \r\ncrime of aggression had both been ratified or accepted \r\nby 30 States. Georgia has also ratified both amendments \r\nand looks forward to the decision of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties on the issue of their activation.\r\nGeorgia fully subscribes to the notion that without \r\nthe rule of law, impunity reigns and neither justice nor \r\npeace can be achieved. The prevention of the gravest \r\ncrimes, which, as the preamble to the Rome Statute \r\nstates, threaten the peace, security and well-being \r\nof the world, is vital to upholding the rule of law at \r\nthe international level, based on the principles of \r\ninternational law and the common values of humankind \r\nthat the Court and the United Nations share.\r\nRegrettably, our generation continues to witness \r\nheinous crimes of unspeakable scale and gravity. The \r\nestablishment of the International Criminal Court set \r\na new justice paradigm. In that sense, the value of the \r\nCourt’s work for humankind is high in terms not only \r\nof the punishment of perpetrators of genocide, war \r\ncrimes and crimes against humanity, but also of the \r\nprevention of the future occurrence of such acts. We \r\nbelieve that accountability is important not simply for \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 19/28\r\nthe sake of the past, but in particular to build a future \r\nfree of violence by avoiding the recurrence of conflicts \r\nand the repetition of violence, as well as by ensuring \r\njustice for the victims of mass atrocity crimes.\r\nIn that context, we regret the recent decisions \r\nof some States to leave the jurisdiction of the Court. \r\nWe would like to encourage the States not yet parties \r\nto consider joining the Rome Statute to strengthen \r\nthe effectiveness and credibility of the Court, as \r\nwell as to provide further support for international \r\ncriminal justice.\r\nGeorgia reaffirms its commitment to the work \r\nundertaken by the Court in accordance with its mandate. \r\nEffective and comprehensive cooperation and assistance \r\nby States are indispensable for the Court to carry out \r\nits activities successfully, more so given the Court’s \r\ncomplementary role to national criminal jurisdictions.\r\nGeorgia has been cooperating with the Court ever \r\nsince the ICC Prosecutor announced the start of the \r\npreliminary examination of the 2008 war in Georgia, \r\non 14 August 2008. As an enabling factor for the full-\r\nf ledged cooperation with the ICC, Georgia has put in \r\nplace adequate implementing legislation of the Rome \r\nStatute at the national level. I would like to highlight \r\nsome of the key aspects of the ongoing cooperation \r\nwith the ICC.\r\nMy country has been a victim of international \r\ncrimes since the 1990s — and notably in August 2008, \r\nwhen thousands of civilians were targeted in another \r\nwave of ethnic cleansing and other heinous acts. At the \r\nnational level, Georgia has carried out investigations \r\non an unprecedented scale. In particular, the Georgian \r\ninvestigation team interrogated over 7,000 witnesses, \r\nobtained over 200 forensic expert opinions and carried \r\nout crime-scene inspections in over 30 inhabited \r\nareas. Where the evidence was inaccessible owing \r\nto the Russian occupation of areas of Georgian \r\nterritory — which were fenced off with artificial \r\nbarriers, including razor wire — the crime scenes were \r\nexamined through satellite imagery.\r\nHowever, despite our continuous efforts, our ability \r\nto carry out additional necessary investigative measures \r\nin the Abkhazia and Tskhinvali regions at this stage is \r\nhampered by the illegal foreign occupation. In such \r\ncircumstances, the request of Prosecutor Bensouda and \r\nthe subsequent decision of the Pre-Trial Chamber dated \r\n27 January to authorize proprio motu investigation into \r\nall crimes under the Rome Statute committed during the \r\n2008 international armed conflict between the Russian \r\nFederation and Georgia have been recognized as an \r\nimportant step in acknowledging the ordeal suffered by \r\nthe victims, as well as in combating impunity for the \r\ncrimes committed between 1 July and 10 October 2008. \r\nGeorgia further noted the Pre-Trial Chamber’s decision \r\nto be legally sound and in line with international law. \r\nWe hope that, as Prosecutor Bensouda emphasized \r\nin February 2016, the investigation “will lead to \r\nestablishing the truth and bringing justice to the victims \r\n... who suffered so terribly during the conflict.”\r\nAccording to the Chamber,\r\n“an international armed conflict existed between \r\nGeorgia and the Russian Federation between \r\n1 July and 10 October 2008. The existence \r\nof such international armed conflict is rather \r\nuncontroversial as concerns the period of armed \r\nhostilities between Georgian and Russian armed \r\nforces between 8 and 12 August 2008 and the \r\nperiod of Russian occupation of parts of Georgian \r\nterritory, in particular the ‘buffer zone’, until at \r\nleast 10 October 2008. In addition, the Chamber \r\nconsiders, at this stage, that there is sufficient \r\nindication that the Russian Federation exercised \r\noverall control over the South Ossetian forces, \r\nmeaning that also the period before the direct \r\nintervention of Russian forces may be seen as an \r\ninternational armed conflict”.\r\nThe Chamber further notes that the consistent \r\npattern of deliberate killing, beating and threatening \r\ncivilians, detention, looting properties and systematic \r\ndestruction of Georgian houses and other acts were \r\ncommitted “with a view to forcibly expelling ethnic \r\nGeorgians from the territory of South Ossetia in \r\nfurtherance of the overall objective to change the \r\nethnic composition of the territory” and severing any \r\nremaining links with other parts of Georgia.\r\nThe Chamber also noted, based on the available \r\ninformation,  that during the 2008 armed conflictthe \r\ncrimes committed against ethnic Georgians\r\n“resulted in 51-113 killings, the destruction of \r\nover 5,000 dwellings and the forced displacement \r\nof 13,400-18,500 persons constituting, in the \r\nestimation of the Prosecutor, a 75 per cent \r\ndecrease in the ethnically Georgian population in \r\nSouth Ossetia.”\r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n20/28 16-35110\r\nAt this stage of cooperation with the Court, a \r\nspecial agreement on cooperation has been concluded \r\nbetween the Government of Georgia and the Office of \r\nthe Prosecutor. The document establishes mechanisms \r\nto operationalize and enhance cooperation between the \r\nparties and to facilitate the expeditious conduct by the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor of the ICC of the investigations \r\nand prosecutions within the territory of Georgia. We \r\nare ready to continue cooperation with the Court in the \r\nframework of the above mentioned agreement.\r\nMr. Węckowicz (Poland): Poland aligns itself with \r\nthe statement made by the observer of European Union. \r\nWe would like to make the following remarks in our \r\nnational capacity.\r\nFirst, we would like to thank the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) for the twelfth annual report \r\non its activities (see A/71/342). We thank President \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for giving us a comprehensive \r\nbriefing of the main issues concerning the ICC over the \r\npast year. \r\nAs highlighted in the report, the Court faced an \r\nunprecedented workload, with four trials taking place \r\nsimultaneously. At the same time, the Office of the \r\nProsecutor has been conducting investigations into a \r\nsignificant number of situations. Such a caseload is a \r\nclear indication of the importance of the Court, as well \r\nas of the worldwide demand for justice.\r\nPoland recognizes the significant judicial \r\ndevelopments during the reporting period, including \r\nthe first case involving both command responsibility \r\nand the first conviction for sexual violence, and the case \r\ninvolving the first conviction for destroying religious \r\nmonuments. Those rulings send a strong signal that \r\nsuch crimes will be prosecuted. Unfortunately, over the \r\nsame period, new crimes of the same or similar nature \r\nand many other grave crimes are reported to have \r\nbeen committed.\r\nThere is a widespread expectation that such \r\natrocious crimes cannot go unpunished. The ICC \r\nhas a crucial role in upholding that expectation and \r\nin fulfilling the hopes of victims all over the world. \r\nHowever, we must remember that, in line with the \r\nprinciple of complementarity, the primary responsibility \r\nfor preventing the most serious crimes rests with States \r\nparties. \r\nPoland remains committed to the idea of ensuring \r\nthat mass atrocities are addressed and further crimes \r\nare prevented, and continues to support the system \r\nof international criminal justice. As the ICC is the \r\ncornerstone of that system, we encourage all States \r\nto become parties to the Rome Statute. The broadest \r\npossible participation in the work of ICC should help to \r\nput an end to the most serious crimes under international \r\nlaw, no matter where they are committed.\r\nWe place a high value on the African States’ \r\nparticipation in the discussion on the international \r\nsystem of justice. The fact that African countries \r\nmake up the biggest United Nations regional group \r\namong the States parties to the Rome Statute shows \r\ntheir commitment to the fight against the most serious \r\ncrimes of international law. In that context, however, it \r\nwas with regret that we learned about the decision of \r\nsome countries to withdraw from the Rome Statute. We \r\nhope that they will reconsider their position.\r\nThe continual enhancement of the Court’s \r\neffectiveness is vital in the process of fighting \r\nimpunity for the gravest crimes under international \r\nlaw. Cooperation with the Court is essential in order to \r\nsuppress the grave crimes threatening peace, security \r\nand well-being of the world — that being the paramount \r\nconsideration of the ICC and among the prime concerns \r\nof the Security Council and the United Nations at large.\r\nPoland reiterates its support for the ICC as a \r\ncourt capable of instituting effective proceedings, \r\nthereby helping to maintain peace around the world, \r\nwhose jurisdiction is widely recognized. Stability, \r\nalong with the efficient use of resources, is crucial \r\nfor dispensing justice expeditiously. The Court’s new \r\npermanent premises should allow for progress in that \r\nrespect. For the thousands of people across the globe \r\nwho have suffered as a result of massive crimes, that \r\nbuilding stands as a symbol and a promise of long-\r\nawaited justice. We have to do everything we can to \r\nmake sure that their hopes are not dashed. We should \r\nspare no effort to continue supporting the Court in \r\nfulfilling its mandate and to protect its independence \r\nand impartiality.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nSudan would like to reaffirm its dedication to the \r\nprinciples underlying the United Nations. Those \r\nprinciples have as their objective the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, the strengthening of \r\nsustainable development and the protection of human \r\nrights through international cooperation and dialogue \r\nin order to enhance cordiality in international relations \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 21/28\r\nand contribute to the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\nTo that end, the Charter of the United Nations includes \r\nprovisions that require respect for the sovereignty of \r\nStates and non-interference in the internal affairs \r\nof States so as to ensure their political independence \r\nand territorial integrity. International justice must be \r\nviewed as a way to overcome economic, social and \r\npolitical differences and prevent the use of force in \r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe fight against impunity is a noble objective, \r\nwhich should not be the subject of differences of \r\nopinion. It is the concern, first and foremost, of \r\nnational judicial bodies, within the extent of their legal \r\npowers. Attempts to politicize international justice \r\nare a platform for narrow interests and go against the \r\nobjectives agreed to by the international community \r\nin order to achieve justice and succesfully fulfil the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter. Such attempts \r\nviolate international law and lead to increased tensions \r\nwithin the international community, instead of \r\nstrengthening peace, as advocated by the Charter.\r\nAt a time when we are deliberating on the report \r\nof the International Criminal Court (see A/71/342), it \r\nis relevant to note that relations between the United \r\nNations and the International Criminal Court (ICC) \r\nshould take into account the independent nature of the \r\ntwo bodies and that there is no organic or structural link \r\nbetween the two entities. It is therefore very perturbing \r\nto see attempts by some States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute to prevail upon the General Assembly to usurp \r\nthe prerogatives of the ICC, and vice versa.\r\nMy country has already expressed its position \r\nin that regard (see A/70/PV.95) and denounced the \r\ntrends reflected in the draft resolution (A/70/L.47) on \r\nthe ICC report. The sponsors of the draft resolution \r\nintend to propose a new paragraph containing vague \r\ninterpretations that do not reflect the spirit of Vienna \r\nConventions and Optional Protocols, and which we \r\ndenounce. The Sudan consistently maintained this \r\nposition during the informal consultations on the draft \r\nresolution. We would like to state that we uphold that \r\nposition and to call upon States to agree to the existing \r\nprovisions and to reject any vague interpretations.\r\nThe practices of the ICC clearly reflect its \r\ntransformation into a tool for international disputes \r\nand a mechanism for politicization. The Court focuses \r\nexclusively on Africa and is targeting African leaders \r\nand symbols, something which has compelled African \r\npublic opinion to describe the Court as being run by \r\nthe big Powers, whose aim it is to target developing \r\ncountries.\r\nA number of questions demand answers. Where is \r\nthe justice for the crimes committed in other parts of \r\nthe world, and why is the ICC turning a blind eye to \r\nthose atrocities? Is the ICC not a world court charged \r\nwith combating impunity everywhere? Where are the \r\nguiding principles of neutrality, independence and \r\nintegrity when it comes to dispensing justice? These \r\nare difficult issues for which we have sought answers \r\nfrom the ICC, but in vain. The conduct of the Court, \r\nhowever, provides us with a response. The ICC is \r\nfocusing on one thing, and that is targeting Africans \r\nand African States.\r\nThe relationship between the ICC and the Security \r\nCouncil is a f lagrant form of politicization. There \r\nshould not be any link between the Security Council \r\nand the ICC. The Council, in fact, has the prerogative \r\nof bringing some countries before the Court while it \r\nspares others. This is a relationship that clearly reflects \r\nthe existence of conflict between the interests of justice \r\nand political interests.\r\nWe are not the only ones to express our profound \r\nconcern regarding the negative impact of voluntary \r\ncontributions to the budget of the Court. These are \r\ncontributions that harm the integrity and independence \r\nof the ICC. Nor are we the only ones to express \r\nour concern about the ambiguity that has been \r\ncompromising the spirit of integrity embodied in the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. This is an ambiguity that \r\nhas been described by an ICC official as being positive. \r\nThis same ambiguity has led one a European Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs to say that the jurisdiction of the \r\nCourt cannot apply to his own State.\r\nThe actions of certain States that are using the \r\nICC as an instrument for foreign policy are cause \r\nfor concern. Such States are funding the ICC in the \r\nframework of the voluntary contribution system. Fifty \r\nper cent of the ICC annual budget is provided by such \r\nStates, despite the fact that the Court is meant to be an \r\nindependent body, including in terms of its finances.\r\nThis has given rise to a form of conflict between \r\njustice and peace. We certainly recall a remark by a \r\nformer Prosecutor of the Court, who said that he had \r\nno interest in the efforts made by States to bring about \r\npeace. This was included in a legal report of the Court.\r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n22/28 16-35110\r\nToday we are witnessing, particularly from the \r\nAfrican perspective, structural obstacles within the \r\nCourt, which has become a politicized body with \r\ndouble standards. We expect these obstacles and that \r\npoliticization, which stain the reputation of the ICC, to \r\nbe eliminated in the near future. We hope that the Court \r\nwill be able to exercise its authority with full regard for \r\nthe principle of transparency.\r\nThe Court has been reaping what it sows. Yet \r\njustice is a noble principle, which should not be \r\nsubjected to political calculations. The International \r\nCourt of Justice, with its record of peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes between States, has been in existence since \r\n1946. Instead of imposing jurisdiction over countries, \r\nthat Court, pursuant to Article 36 of its Statute, \r\nexercises its jurisdiction only when States parties refer \r\ncases to it. Those who favour the International Criminal \r\nCourt express their concern and disappointment over \r\nthe position taken by African States and other States \r\nthroughout the world. The population of those countries \r\nis more than 60 per cent of world’s population. \r\nWe pose the following question: In the 14 years \r\nsince the adoption of the Rome Statute, what is the \r\nnumber of cases in which the ICC has taken a decision? \r\nOver 14 years, just three. Another question arises: \r\nWhat are the expenditures of the Court in order to deal \r\nwith these matters? Well, here we are talking about \r\nmillions of euros in expenditures. For one case, it can \r\nbe $1.5 million. How can we call this justice? How can \r\nsuch a court combat impunity, I ask? Add to all of that \r\nthe fact that the cases in which the Court has taken a \r\ndecision have all been African cases.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s reports (A/71/346 and \r\nA/71/349) should respect the relationship between \r\nthe United Nations and the International Criminal \r\nCourt without providing any vague explanations. My \r\ndelegation expresses its concern over the interference \r\nof the international community in the prerogatives of \r\nthe Secretary-General and its dictating to officials the \r\nmanner in which the reports should be submitted and \r\nhow they should carry out their obligations.\r\nIn conclusion, my country reaffirms its dedication \r\nto combating impunity and in favour of justice. As \r\nfor the two bodies which are competent to deal with \r\njustice, we refuse any cooperation with the ICC, to \r\nwhose Statute we are not a party. We have no obligation \r\nto that body pursuant to the Vienna Convention.\r\nMr. Ruda Santolaria (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation reaffirms Peru’s commitment to the fight \r\nagainst international impunity and to the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), which, in accordance with \r\nthe principle of complementarity, is the institution in \r\nthe best position to prevent the most serious crimes \r\nfrom going unpunished. In that context, we welcome \r\nwith interest the report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt on its activities in the 2015-2016 judicial year \r\n(see A/71/342), which has just been submitted to \r\nthe General Assembly in accordance with article 6 \r\nof the Relationship Agreement between the United \r\nNations and the International Criminal Court and with \r\nparagraph 28 of resolution 70/264.\r\nLikewise, Peru reiterates its recognition of the work \r\nof the Court, which is unfolding in strict compliance \r\nwith the provisions of the Rome Statute and is not \r\ninfluenced by any other type of consideration. This \r\nis reflected in the unprecedented caseload currently \r\non the ICC docket, which consists of 23 cases and 10 \r\nsituations. \r\nAmong the judicial developments of the past year, \r\nmy delegation wishes to emphasize that the Court has \r\nconfirmed the first war crime indictment in relation to \r\nthe destruction of historic monuments and buildings of \r\na cultural character, among other things. In addition, \r\nwe welcome the fact that the Court has moved into its \r\nown headquarters on a permanent basis.\r\nDespite these advances, Peru recognizes that \r\ninternational criminal justice continues to be an \r\naspiration, and that the International Criminal Court, as \r\na young judicial institution on the international scene, \r\nneeds greater support and a higher level of cooperation. \r\nSuch support should come not only from States parties \r\nto the Rome Statute, but from all States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. Likewise, we hope that we will have \r\nfruitful debates at the current session and that they will \r\nlead to a draft resolution that reflects the interests of \r\nthe international community as a whole in the fight \r\nagainst international impunity.\r\nRecognizing, on the other hand, that the Court \r\ncan continue to improve its efficiency, Peru supports \r\nthe adoption of measures of a practical nature, in \r\nconformity with the Rome Statute, to streamline \r\nprocedures and improve the effectiveness of the Court, \r\nincluding the proposed amendments, provided that \r\nthey do not undermine due process or the rights of the \r\nparties and the victims.\r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 23/28\r\nMy delegation wishes to reiterate the need for \r\nfurther progress towards a comprehensive reform \r\nof the Security Council, particularly with regard to \r\nits working methods and the use of the veto. That is \r\nespecially relevant given the imperative of preventing \r\nheinous crimes. When a State has been unable to meet \r\nits sovereign responsibility to protect its population, \r\nwe have observed that the international community \r\nhas been unable to adequately respond and the \r\nSecurity Council has been unable to meet its primary \r\nresponsibility of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity. Therefore, Peru supports the French initiative \r\nand the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\nGroup initiative on the code of conduct regarding \r\nSecurity Council action against genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity or war crimes.\r\nAs to the relationship between the ICC and the \r\nSecurity Council, my delegation wishes to emphasize \r\nthat, for the first time, the Council, through its \r\npresidency, has responded to letters of the International \r\nCriminal Court on situations referred by that organ. \r\nNevertheless, it is clear that much remains to be done \r\nwith regard to strengthening this relationship.\r\nIn another vein, Peru — which belongs to the \r\ninformal ministerial network for the International \r\nCriminal Court — attaches the greatest importance \r\nto the universality of the Rome Statute. Therefore, \r\nout of concern at recent developments that may affect \r\nsuch universality, we take this opportunity to call on \r\nStates that have not yet done so to consider ratifying the \r\nStatute, preferably in its 2010 version.\r\nPeru is a peaceful and stable country that has \r\novercome serious internal conflicts in its history. \r\nThat was possible thanks to the application of genuine \r\naccountability mechanisms, which are the best way \r\nof preventing the recurrence of serious human rights \r\nviolations. We therefore encourage States’ efforts in \r\npromoting the universality of the Rome Statute and \r\nstrengthening national jurisdictions, which is also \r\ndirectly related to implementing the 2030 Agenda, \r\nspecifically Sustainable Development Goal 16. That \r\nGoal is an important platform for better incorporating \r\nmatters related to international justice into the \r\nframework of the rule of law and for accessing justice \r\nat the national and international levels.\r\nMrs. Pino Rivero (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nCuban delegation takes note of the report (see A/71/342) \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC), which was \r\npresented by Ms. Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, and \r\nit wishes to express before the General Assembly its \r\ncommitment to the fight against impunity for crimes \r\nthat affect the international community.\r\nThe current international state of affairs and the \r\nevents that have taken place over the past few years \r\nclearly demonstrate the need for an autonomous \r\ninternational judicial body that can lead the fight \r\nagainst impunity for the most serious crimes. However, \r\nin the light of article 16 of the Rome Statute and the \r\nample powers bestowed upon the Security Council \r\nin relation to the work of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, the Court is far from being an independent \r\ninstitution. Apart from undermining the essence of the \r\norgan’s jurisdiction, that issue violates the principle of \r\nindependence of judicial bodies and the transparency \r\nand impartiality of the administration of justice. The \r\nreferrals made to the Court by the Security Council \r\nconfirm that negative trend, to which our country has \r\nreferred on various occasions.\r\nIn the Security Council’s referral processes \r\ninternational law is constantly violated and developing \r\ncountries are attacked in the name of a supposed fight \r\nagainst impunity. It is for that reason that Cuba reiterates \r\nits support for the establishment of an international \r\ncriminal jurisdiction that is impartial, non-selective, \r\neffective, fair, complementary to national justice \r\nsystems and genuinely independent, and therefore free \r\nfrom subjugation to political interests that might erode \r\nits essence.\r\nUnfortunately, issues related to those topics were \r\nnot settled at the Review Conference of the Rome \r\nStatute, held in Kampala from 31 May to 11 June 2010, \r\nand the Court, as an international criminal jurisdiction, \r\ncontinues to be subjected to decisions of the Security \r\nCouncil that are unlawful, anti-democratic, abusive and \r\nin breach of international law. The Council continues \r\nto offer total impunity to those really responsible for \r\ncrimes against the international community.\r\nIt is unfortunate that various Security Council \r\nresolutions stipulate that crimes committed by forces of \r\nto certain Powers members of the Security Council that \r\nare not parties to the Statute of Rome remain exempt \r\nfrom any investigation. Such standards are offensive to \r\nthe international community; they are evidence of the \r\npolitical double standard with which the the Council \r\noperates, and they violate the principles governing the \r\nwork of the International Criminal Court.\r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n24/28 16-35110\r\nThe Cuban delegation reiterates that the International \r\nCriminla Court cannot ignore international treaties and \r\nthe principles of international law. The Court must \r\nrespect the legal principle concerning the consent of a \r\nState to be bound by a treaty, as provided for in article \r\n11 of part II of the Vienna Convention on the Law of \r\nTreaties of 23 May 1969. \r\nCuba wishes to reiterate its serious concern \r\nregarding the precedent set by the decisions of the \r\nCourt to initiate judicial proceedings against nationals \r\nof States non-parties to the Rome Statute that have not \r\neven accepted the jurisdiction of the Court, pursuant to \r\narticle 12 of its Statute. \r\nAs rightly noted in the report, the Rome Statute \r\nwas never meant to replace national courts. We should \r\nnot lose sight of the fact that the International Criminal \r\nCourt must remain independent of the political \r\norgans of the United Nations and always function in a \r\ncomplementary way to national criminal courts.\r\nFor 50 years the people of Cuba have been victims \r\nof every form of aggression. Harassment and aggression \r\nhave caused thousands of deaths and injuries in our \r\ncountry; hundreds of families have lost children, \r\nparents and siblings and there have been innumerable \r\nmaterial, economic and financial losses. However, the \r\ndefinition of the crime of aggression arrived at during \r\nthe Kampala Conference is far from encompassing \r\nsome of the elements mentioned here. The definition \r\nof the crime of aggression should cover all forms of \r\naggression that occur in international relations among \r\nStates. It should not be limited to the use of armed \r\nforce, but should also include aggression that affects \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and the political \r\nindependence of States.\r\nThe International Criminal Court must report to \r\nthe General Assembly on its activities in accordance \r\nwith the Relationship Agreement. Although Cuba is not \r\na party to the Criminal Court, it is willing to continue \r\nto actively participate in negotiation processes related \r\nto the Court, and especially on the draft resolution on \r\nthe report of the International Criminal Court, which \r\nthe General Assembly adopts every year, which must \r\nreflect the positions of both States parties and States \r\nnon-parties to the Court.\r\nCuba reaffirms its will to fight impunity and \r\nmaintains its commitment to international criminal \r\njustice, to the principles of transparency, independence \r\nand impartiality and to the unrestricted application of \r\nand respect for international law.\r\nMs. Yparraguirre (Philippines): My delegation \r\nwould like to thank President Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi for her comprehensive report to the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Philippines reaffirms its commitment to \r\nfighting impunity, to ensuring that perpetrators are \r\nheld accountable for their crimes and to seeing that \r\ncriminal justice is delivered. For peace and security \r\nwould not be possible without justice. Without peace \r\nbased on justice, the achievement of our 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development will be compromised.\r\nEnsuring that individuals are held accountable for \r\ninternational crimes has been a defining achievement \r\nof international law. That is the legacy of Nuremberg, \r\nafter the Second World War, when it was decided that:\r\n“Crimes against international law are committed \r\nby men, not by abstract entities, and only by \r\npunishing individuals who commit such crimes can \r\nthe provisions of international law be enforced.”\r\nOver the 70 years since the United Nations was \r\nfounded in San Francisco, the prayer of our founding \r\nfathers and mothers remains a beacon of hope and \r\ncommitment to save us — and those after us — from \r\nthe scourge of war, which twice in their lifetime brought \r\nuntold sorrow to all humankind.\r\nAmong its many achievements, the United Nations \r\ncounts the rule of international law at the apex. In \r\ninternational criminal justice, the United Nations, \r\nthrough the International Law Commission and the \r\ninitiative of Trinidad and Tobago in 1989, recognized \r\nthe undeniable clamour for a permanent international \r\ncriminal court, which culminated in the diplomatic \r\nconference and the adoption of the Rome Statute in \r\n1998, its entry into force in 2002, and the election of \r\nthe first bench of judges in 2003.\r\nJust as Nuremberg pointed to individuals as authors \r\nof untold sorrow and injustice to multitudes, so must we \r\nrecognize individuals who contribute to the collective \r\nwork of delivering international justice, a vocation that \r\nis certainly difficult, sometimes thankless and possibly \r\ndangerous. Indeed, it is people individually, rather than \r\ncollectively, who make justice work: members of the \r\nSecretariat across the United Nations family who are \r\ninvolved in the delivery of justice; the judges of the \r\nCourt, the Prosecutor and their respective staffs; the \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 25/28\r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties and his \r\nteam and the lawyers, civil society advocates, witnesses \r\nand the victims — they are all unique individuals, but \r\ntogether they contribute in varying, but none the less \r\nvaluable, degrees to the common goal of delivering \r\ninternational criminal justice.\r\nOur goal is universality. We join the call for many \r\nmore countries to ratify or accede to the Rome Statute, \r\nparticularly from our Asia-Pacific region. We welcome \r\nthe accession of El Salvador as the newest State party to \r\nthe Rome Statute. States parties or not, we should help \r\neach other to protect human rights and build domestic \r\ncapacities, including through assistance with human \r\nresource development such as the training of judges, \r\nprosecutors, the police and the military.\r\nThe five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil should refrain from using their veto in \r\nsituations involving mass atrocity crimes that are \r\nunder the jurisdiction of the International Criminal \r\nCourt. For that reason, the Philippines supported the \r\ncode of conduct regarding Security Council action \r\nagainst genocide, crimes against humanity or war \r\ncrimes, elaborated in the context of the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency Group. We also call on \r\nthe Security Council to take the necessary follow-up \r\nmeasures regarding situations that it has referred to the \r\nCourt, so as to uphold the credibility of both institutions \r\nand ensure accountability.\r\nThe Philippines pays close attention to the \r\nincreasingly heavy workload of the Court: its pending \r\njudicial proceedings, situations and preliminary \r\nexaminations. It is our hope, however, that the \r\nInternational Criminal Court will continue to deliver \r\non its mandate with the utmost dedication, impartiality, \r\nefficiency and integrity.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): We thank \r\nPresident Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi for the \r\npresentation of the report of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (see A/71/342), which illustrates the impressive \r\nprogress the Court has made in the reporting period. \r\nWe regret the recent decisions of South Africa and \r\nBurundi to leave the Court. South Africa in particular \r\nwas instrumental in the drafting of the Rome Statute, \r\nand without its contribution, the Court would not have \r\nbeen established. We hope that its role as a leader in \r\nmatters pertaining to human rights and justice will \r\ncause the Government to reconsider its decision.\r\nThe decisions to withdraw come at a moment when \r\nthe Court has made significant progress in its judicial \r\nwork and is regarded as a body that will dispense \r\njustice all around the world — from Africa, where \r\nthe largest part of the International Criminal Court \r\ncommunity has its home, to other parts of the world, \r\nincluding places like Syria, where the Court does not \r\nyet have jurisdiction. In our quest for universality, any \r\ncountry leaving the Court is naturally an unwelcome \r\ndevelopment.\r\nAt the same time, now is also a moment to pause \r\nand reflect on the historic significance of the institution \r\nand to rally around it in support. We are encouraged to \r\nsee that policymakers, civil society and Governments \r\nall around the world have been doing just that, including \r\nthis morning in the debate. \r\nThe Rome Statute is without any question one of the \r\nbiggest achievements in the history of treaty-making \r\nand codification of international law. Even States that \r\nhave not yet decided to join it turn to its provisions, in \r\nparticular with respect to the definition of crimes. And \r\nwith all the difficulties the Court has had to overcome, \r\nthe Rome Statute itself has demonstrated its value and \r\nworth since its entry into force. In today’s climate, we \r\nwould probably have difficulty even setting up a process \r\nto negotiate a treaty for an independent international \r\ncourt with jurisdiction over the most serious crimes \r\nunder international law; we certainly would not be able \r\nto agree on an outcome. The achievement reflected \r\nin the Rome Statute is unique, and today provides an \r\nopportunity to stand up for it. \r\nThe mere existence of the Court has given hope and \r\nvoice to victims on every continent and will continue \r\nto do so. A court with the mandate to adjudicate the \r\nmost serious crimes under international law and to do \r\nso with a policy of seeking accountability for those \r\nwith the largest share of responsibility is bound to come \r\nunder political pressure. And that is why we are asking \r\nthose States that have joined it — almost two thirds of \r\nthe United Nations membership — to stand up for it.\r\nThat is not to say that everything is perfect; \r\ndiscussions are needed to make the Court a better \r\ninstitution. We have consistently engaged in a critical \r\nanalysis of its performance in a manner that is open \r\nand productive at the same time. Its proceedings can be, \r\nand must become, more efficient and more effective. \r\nWe understand that others have their own concerns and \r\nwe will continue engaging with them in that regard. \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n26/28 16-35110\r\nAnd certainly, at such a critical juncture, engagement is \r\nmore important than ever. We are prepared for it, on the \r\nunderstanding that the integrity of the Rome Statute, \r\nand of its key provisions in particular, provides the \r\ncontext in which those discussions will take place.\r\nWithout universality, the reality remains that the \r\nability of the International Criminal Court to provide \r\njustice for victims in many countries is subject to \r\nthe political will of the Security Council — usually \r\nwith no result. Nowhere has the Security Council’s \r\ninability to provide accountability been more apparent \r\nthan in Syria, where the most serious crimes under \r\ninternational law have been committed in a widespread \r\nand often systematic manner and are well documented. \r\nThe proposal to refer the situation to the International \r\nCriminal Court was vetoed in 2014, and the Council \r\nhas been silent ever since on the issue of accountability \r\nfor crimes in Syria and has been paralysed with regard \r\nto all other aspects. We look forward to working \r\nwith those that are willing to commit to making the \r\nCourt a more universal institution, especially at this \r\ndifficult juncture.\r\nWhile business as usual is certainly not the order \r\nof the day, it is important that the work of the Court \r\ncontinue. And crucial developments have indeed taken \r\nplace in the reporting period. Eight additional States \r\nhave ratified the Kampala amendments on the crime of \r\naggression, bringing the total number of ratifications \r\nto 32. That means that the threshold of 30 ratifications \r\nrequired for activation has been reached. States parties \r\nare therefore able to activate the jurisdiction of the Court \r\nover this crime in 2017. The decision will make the \r\nmost serious forms of the illegal use of force justiciable \r\nbefore an international court for the first time since the \r\nNuremberg trials, whose seventieth anniversary we are \r\ncommemorating this year. The Court will thereby help \r\nto enforce a key provision of the Charter of the United \r\nNations: the prohibition of the illegal use of force. \r\nWe are committed to working closely with all \r\nStates parties — those that have ratified and those \r\nthat have yet to do so — towards a smooth and simple \r\nactivation decision in a year’s time. We also continue \r\nour outreach to States to further increase the group of \r\nratifiers and to engage with States that are interested in \r\nratifying and implementing the Kampala amendments.\r\nWe encourage States that are interested in joining \r\nthe ICC to ratify the Rome Statute in its 2010 version \r\nwith the Kampala amendments, just as El Salvador has \r\ndone during the reporting period.\r\nMr. Emilou (Cyprus): At the outset, I would like to \r\nexpress my warm appreciation to President Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi for her comprehensive presentation of \r\nthe report covering the period from 1 August 2015 to \r\n31 July 2016 (see A/71/342).\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the observer of the European Union \r\nand would like to deliver additional remarks in its \r\nnational capacity, focusing on the goal of universality \r\nof the Rome Statute.\r\nIt is our firm belief that the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC) significantly contributes to the overall \r\ngoal of the United Nations to work towards a more just \r\nand peaceful world, serving, in this way, the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nAs ref lected in the report, the Court had another \r\nvery full year in terms of judicial proceedings, \r\ninvestigations, preliminary examinations and \r\ninstitutional developments. The Court, as it continues \r\nat full speed, is currently seized of 23 cases and 10 \r\nsituations in different parts of the world, and a larger \r\nnumber of crimes under the Rome Statute.\r\nOn 27 September, the Court delivered its judgment \r\nin the Ahmad Al-Faqi Al-Mahdi case. The Trial \r\nChamber unanimously found Mr. Al-Mahdi guilty \r\nas a co-perpetrator of the war crime consisting in \r\nintentionally directing attacks against religious and \r\nhistoric buildings in Timbuktu, Mali, in June and July \r\n2012. It was the first time that the Court dealt with \r\nthe intentional destruction of cultural property in the \r\ncontext of a conflict, which is defined as a war crime \r\nunder article 8 of the Rome Statute. In its reasoning, \r\nthe Court ref lected some of the longest-standing \r\nand most firmly established principles governing \r\nthe conduct of hostilities. It echoed in substance the \r\nRegulations concerning the Laws and Customs of War \r\non Land — the Hague Regulations, annexed to the \r\n1907 Hague Convention — the 1954 Hague Convention \r\nfor the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of \r\nArmed Conflict, and the Protocols Additional to the \r\nGeneva Conventions of 1949. The cooperation and \r\nsupport of States and organizations such as UNESCO \r\nwas crucial in bringing the Al-Mahdi case before \r\nthe ICC.\r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.37\r\n16-35110 27/28\r\nThe destruction of cultural heritage in any country \r\nconstitutes a collective loss for humankind as a whole. \r\nProtecting cultural property benefits particularly the \r\ncountry and continent concerned. The recent ICC \r\njudgment therefore underlines that the international \r\ncommunity remains vigilant in holding accountable \r\nthose responsible for such war crimes. \r\nThat brings me to my next point, that cooperation \r\nis the cornerstone of the Court’s effective functioning. \r\nWe are pleased to note that during the reporting period, \r\nthe United Nations continued to work closely with the \r\nCourt to further strengthen cooperation and ensure the \r\neffective implementation of the Relationship Agreement. \r\nWe moreover support the further strengthening of that \r\nrelationship by means of practical steps, such as those \r\nset out in previous reports of the Court to the Assembly \r\nof States Parties on the status of ongoing cooperation \r\nbetween the International Criminal Court and the \r\nUnited Nations. Furthermore, cooperation with States \r\nparties and non-parties remains a key element in the \r\nwider effort.\r\nAlthough, in the Al-Mahdi case the Court was able \r\nto address the destruction of cultural property in Mali, \r\nin other instances it has not been able to deal with \r\nsimilar situations that may have taken place or are still \r\ntaking place. While the Court has a global mandate, \r\nit does not have universal participation. It may be \r\nrecognized that the universal ratification of the Rome \r\nStatute remains the only realistic way of effectively \r\naddressing jurisdictional gaps, and consequently \r\ncurrent challenges and shortcomings, and it is crucial \r\nto the application of the principle of equality before the \r\nlaw and for the effective deterrence of the most serious \r\ncrimes under international law.\r\nIn that respect, we warmly welcome the accession \r\nof the El Salvador to the Rome Statute and take this \r\nopportunity to call upon all non-party States to ratify \r\nthe Statute. The large number of ratifications shows \r\na commitment by a majority of countries to ensure \r\naccountability for international crimes. During the \r\nreporting period, the Republic of Cyprus, along with \r\nDenmark —— as co-focal points of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties for achieving the universality and full \r\nimplementation of the Rome Statute —– continued \r\nto promote the collective goal of achieving universal \r\nadherence to the Statute through various events and \r\ninitiatives. We are currently in the process of preparing \r\na social media campaign to promote the Rome Statute.\r\nAt this important juncture, let us not forget that \r\nbefore its creation, the ICC was thought by many to be a \r\nmission impossible. Ever since, and as illustrated by the \r\nAl-Mahdi decision, it has been tangibly contributing to \r\nthe advancement of international justice. Yet right now \r\nthe Court faces its biggest challenge to date. At this \r\ncritical juncture and as the Court continues to be the \r\nindispensable court of last resort, it is more than ever \r\nincumbent on us, as Member States, to work tirelessly \r\nto maintain its deserved global recognition and further \r\nstrengthen and support it.\r\nWe are deeply perturbed by the decision of South \r\nAfrica, one of first signatories of the Statute, and that \r\nof Burundi to withdraw from the Rome Statute. We \r\nare similarly perturbed by the stated intention of the \r\nGambia to withdraw. Although withdrawing from the \r\nStatute is a sovereign act of the State concerned, we \r\nstrongly call on all three countries to reconsider and \r\nto share their concerns before the Assembly of States \r\nParties, in accordance with the Statute. We call on all \r\ncountries that have concerns to utilize the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties as the appropriate forum for dialogue, \r\nwhile respecting the independence and impartiality \r\nof the Court. Together, we have a common interest in \r\nfighting impunity for grave crimes against humanity.\r\nWe are of the view that to abandon the Court is to \r\nassist in thwarting the reach of international justice. We \r\nall have a duty to history, present and future, as well as \r\nto the victims of heinous international crimes — a duty \r\nthat we must fulfil by protecting and supporting the \r\nCourt and helping it to overcome current challenges. \r\nIn that context, my delegation would like to take this \r\nopportunity to reiterate its commitment to the Court \r\nand to reaffirm the unfailing support it has extended \r\nto the Court since its inception. We also extend an \r\nopen and eager invitation to engage in a constructive \r\ndialogue with all Member States that have concerns.\r\nI would like to conclude by mentioning another \r\nmilestone development with respect to international \r\ncriminal law. During the reporting period, the threshold \r\nof 30 ratifications of the Kampala amendments to the \r\nRome Statute on the crime of aggression was reached. \r\nCurrently, 32 States have ratified the amendment. \r\nGiven that development, after 1 January 2017 States \r\nparties will be able to take a decision to activate \r\nthe jurisdiction of the ICC over this specific crime, \r\nthereby completing the coherence of the Rome Statute \r\nas conceived in 1998. We look forward to even more \r\nratifications in the coming months, as that will pave \r\nA/71/PV.37 31/10/2016\r\n28/28 16-35110\r\nthe way for a more impressive activation as soon as \r\npossible after 1 January 2017.\r\nWe continue to act on all fronts in the hope that we \r\nwill be able to consolidate and reinforce international \r\ncriminal justice, rather than deconstruct the Rome \r\nStatute system.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
