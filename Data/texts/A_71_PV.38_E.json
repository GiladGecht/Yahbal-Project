"United Nations A/71/PV.38\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n38th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 31 October 2016, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Pecsteen de \r\nBuytswerve (Belgium), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 72 (continued)\r\nReport of the International Criminal Court\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/71/342)\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/71/346 and \r\nA/71/349)\r\nMr. Barro (Senegal) (spoke in French): First \r\nof all, I would like to thank most warmly Ms. Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), for the leadership she has shown \r\nat the head of the International Criminal and for her \r\nintroduction of the report on the Court on its activities \r\nduring the period 2015-2016 (A/71/342). I would like \r\nalso to pay tribute to all those who within the Court \r\nand elsewhere have committed themselves on a daily \r\nbasis to ensuring that the victims of mass crimes see \r\ntheir right to justice fulfilled. I would also like to \r\nthank the various delegations that have had kind words \r\nabout Mr. Sidiki Kaba, Minister of Justice of Senegal \r\nand President of the Assembly of States Parties to the \r\nRome Statute.\r\nSenegal, the first country to have ratified the \r\nRome Statute, remains convinced that a world of peace \r\nand stability means justice for all and reiterates its \r\ncommitment to working with all stakeholders to that \r\nend. Consideration of the report of the ICC shows the \r\nimportance of the Court in the global fight against \r\nimpunity and in respect for the rule of law. Indeed, the \r\nactivity of the Court in the reporting period shows that \r\nthe only permanent international court for prosecuting \r\nmass crimes contributes greatly to bringing justice to \r\nmillions of victims throughout the world.\r\nWith its record of holding four trials simultaneously, \r\nthe Court has reached new levels, particularly with \r\nthe first case the Court has dealt with on command \r\nresponsibility and criminal liability, which led to \r\nthe first conviction for sexual violence and gave the \r\nlong-suffering peoples involved the feeling that all \r\nof humankind had heard their appeals. The arrest of \r\nAhmad Al-Faqi Al-Madhi, the first individual to plead \r\nguilty to an accusation made by the ICC for war crimes \r\nin relation to attacks on Malian religious and historic \r\nbuildings in the city of Timbuktu and his conviction on \r\n27 September, a few days after the report was issued, \r\nembodies the work done by the Court on behalf of the \r\npopulations involved.\r\nThe preliminary investigations conducted by the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor dealing with 11 cases throughout \r\nthe world and the opening of a new investigation lead \r\nus to believe that, slowly but surely, the universality \r\nof international criminal justice is making headway. \r\nSenegal invites all States to give all the assistance and \r\ncooperation the Court needs to allow it to continue to \r\ncarry out its mandate in the best way possible.\r\nOn 8 December 2014, during his election as \r\nPresident of the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome \r\nStatute, the Minister of Justice of Senegal, Mr. Sidiki \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-35451 (E)\r\n*1635451*\r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n2/22 16-35451\r\nKaba, emphasized that strengthening the relationship \r\nbetween Africa and the International Criminal Court \r\nshould be of the highest priority. This appeal is even \r\nmore relevant today, at a time when States parties in \r\nAfrica have announced their decision to withdraw \r\nfrom the Rome Statute. Senegal, while respectful of \r\nthe sovereignty of all States, nevertheless hopes that \r\na dynamic consensus will be found so that Africa \r\nmay continue to play a major role in the fight against \r\nimpunity within the Assembly of States Parties.\r\nTo that end, we must, among other things, join our \r\nefforts so that the perception of double standards in \r\nthe administration of justice, criticized by some and \r\ncreating misunderstanding, might yield to a common \r\ncommitment for the requirements of justice and for \r\nreparations for the millions of victims who have \r\nsuffered damages. In an era of accountability, the needs \r\nof those victims cannot be disregarded.\r\nAfrica is waging a struggle to end impunity for \r\nheinous crimes and has reaffirmed that in the founding \r\nCharter of the African Union. Senegal remains convinced \r\nthat through dialogue, unity will be preserved. In this \r\nregard, the Assembly of States Parties must remain the \r\nplatform where the concerns of all States are expressed, \r\nand we hope that the Court will continue to be open to \r\ndialogue while respecting judicial independence, as it \r\ndid during its fourteenth session.\r\nToday, the ICC is the only recourse for victims of \r\ngrave crimes committed by the highest-ranking leaders \r\nwhen the victims’ right to justice in their countries is not \r\nupheld. The Rome Statute has also established a system \r\nof international criminal justice, bringing together \r\nStates with the primary responsibility for trying and \r\nobtaining convictions in heinous crimes defined in the \r\nRome Statute, and as a court of last resort. The support \r\nof the international community is therefore essential \r\nfor ensuring efficiency in the Court’s work. I hope that \r\nall States parties to the Statute will remain active and \r\nthat others will join them.\r\nAgain, the universal ratification of the Rome \r\nStatute and the integration of its norms into the national \r\nlegislation of States must become a reality if we want \r\nall victims, wherever they reside, to have a fair and \r\nequal chance at seeing justice. Moreover, we must work \r\ntowards complementarity by strengthening national \r\njudicial systems so that they are in a position to try the \r\nmost serious crimes that have wounded our collective \r\nconscience, thereby letting peace reign. In addition, \r\ndue to the spirit of openness and cooperation shown \r\nby the parties in resolving mutual problems in the \r\ninterest of peace and justice, the discussion will lead to \r\ncontributing in a positive manner to strengthening the \r\nideals and principles that unify us all.\r\nMr. Elias-Fatile (Nigeria): My delegation is \r\ngrateful to the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for \r\nthe report presented to us today for our consideration \r\n(A/71/342). We congratulate the Court on its relocation \r\nto permanent premises in The Hague, Netherlands, \r\nwhich was marked with an official opening ceremony \r\non 19 April.\r\nThe objective of the ICC is based on the concept \r\nthat impunity must be challenged and that everybody \r\nshould be held accountable for their actions. We \r\ntherefore welcome the Court’s appreciable progress in \r\nthe fight against impunity and crimes against humanity. \r\nWe commend the Court for its significant contribution \r\nto the development of substantive and procedural \r\ninternational criminal law. We also recognize the \r\nCourt’s important contribution to the promotion of \r\nthe rule of law. Through its work, accountability for \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes has \r\nbeen strengthened.\r\nWe have studied the report before us closely and \r\nobserved that, during the reporting period, the Court \r\nhad an unprecedented workload, with four cases at \r\ntrial simultaneously and several cases at other stages of \r\nproceedings. We noted that the Court is currently seized \r\nof 23 cases and 10 situations, some of which include its \r\nfirst case involving command responsibility, the first \r\nconviction for sexual violence, the Court’s first war-\r\ncrime charge for the destruction of historic monuments \r\nand religious buildings, the commencement of \r\nreparations proceedings, and convictions and sentences \r\nthat are now being appealed.\r\nIt is also notable that the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nreceived information from various sources alleging the \r\ncommission of crimes potentially falling within the \r\nCourt’s jurisdiction, including the Court’s registration \r\nof 410 communications related to article 15 of the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court, of which \r\n302 were manifestly outside the Court’s jurisdiction, \r\n35 were unrelated to current situations and warranted \r\nfurther analysis, 62 were linked to a situation already \r\nunder analysis, and 11 were linked to an investigation \r\nor prosecution. Indeed, that large number of referrals \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 3/22\r\nentrusted to the Court indicates the increasing \r\nacknowledgement of its relevance as an apt instrument \r\nfor fighting impunity.\r\nWe welcome improved cooperation between the \r\nICC and the principal organs of the United Nations, \r\nespecially the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, including United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions and other United Nations presence in the \r\nfield. As the main forum for international cooperation \r\nand consultation, the United Nations presents a \r\nunique platform for promoting the mainstreaming \r\nand understanding of Rome Statute issues and \r\nconsiderations into wider areas of international activity. \r\nWe also note with satisfaction the report’s coverage \r\nof cooperation with and assistance from States, other \r\ninternational organizations and civil society, as well as \r\nthe cooperation among relevant partners in the context \r\nof supporting and strengthening the Rome Statute \r\nsystem of international criminal justice.\r\nMy delegation further welcomes the exchange \r\nof information between the Libyan Prosecutor-\r\nGeneral’s office and the Office of the ICC Prosecutor. \r\nWe commend the Libyan Prosecutor-General and \r\nthe Libyan representative to the ICC for their close \r\ncooperation with the Office of the Prosecutor. We \r\nencourage the two sides to strengthen their cooperation \r\nand work together to end impunity in Libya.\r\nMy delegation notes that, according to the report, \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor continued its analysis of \r\nwar crimes allegedly committed by Boko Haram and \r\nby the Nigerian security forces in the context of the \r\ncontinuing armed conflict in Nigeria. In response to \r\nthe Prosecutor’s request for information on actions \r\nundertaken by the Government on this matter, the report \r\nadds that the Attorney General and Minister of Justice \r\nof Nigeria gave assurances of Nigeria’s commitment to \r\nsupporting and cooperating with the Office.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, as a committed member \r\nof the Assembly of States Parties to the Rome Statute \r\nof the ICC, under the leadership of Mr. Sidiki Kaba \r\nof Senegal, and a current member of its Bureau, my \r\ndelegation wishes to reiterate Nigeria’s continuing \r\ncommitment to supporting and cooperating with \r\nthe Court. Nigeria believes that impunity must be \r\naddressed resolutely whenever and wherever it may \r\noccur in the world. For this reason, we are faithfully \r\ncommitted to the fundamental values of the Rome \r\nStatute and the ideals of the ICC. As we reaffirm our \r\ncontinued membership in the Assembly, Nigeria is \r\nprepared to continue to work in concert with Member \r\nStates to address the concerns that have been raised \r\nagainst the Court.\r\nIt is our belief that a global system based on rule \r\nof law, where accountability and social justice are the \r\nfoundation for durable peace, should be a priority goal \r\nfor the international community, world leaders and \r\ncitizens alike.\r\nMr. Sobral Duarte (Brazil): My first words are \r\nto thank the International Criminal Court (ICC) for \r\nits report to the General Assembly (A/71/342) and to \r\ncommend the Court for contributing to the fight against \r\nimpunity and promoting respect for the rule of law. I \r\nalso join previous speakers in thanking the President \r\nof the ICC, Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for \r\nher briefing and her tireless efforts to make the Court a \r\nmore efficient institution. Brazil is also pleased that the \r\nICC has moved to its new and purpose-built premises \r\nin The Hague.\r\nAs a proud founder of the ICC, Brazil remains \r\nsteadfast in its commitment to the Rome Statute system \r\nand to the cause of justice that motivated its creation. \r\nAs an instrument for ensuring that those accused before \r\nit are judged with fairness and full respect for their \r\nrights, the ICC is a vehicle for justice and peace. I am \r\npleased to recall that not only are all South American \r\ncountries States parties to the Rome Statute, but also \r\nthat Latin American and Caribbean States represent \r\nthe second-largest regional group among States parties. \r\nToday more than ever it is important to stress that a \r\nmisperception of selectivity with respect to the Court’s \r\nactivity will be definitively dispelled only by advancing \r\nthe universality of the Statute — expanding rather than \r\nshrinking the Court’s room to operate.\r\nAllow me to underscore the importance that Brazil \r\nattaches to the outcomes of the 2010 Kampala Review \r\nConference. We are convinced that the activation \r\nin 2017 of the amendment regarding the crime of \r\naggression will represent a major contribution to \r\ncompleting the international criminal justice system. \r\nIt will give additional meaning to the prohibition of \r\nthe use of force, thus fostering a more stable, just and \r\ndemocratic world order.\r\nBrazil notes with appreciation that providing \r\njustice for victims remains an essential component \r\nin the daily work of the Court. We also welcome the \r\nfact that reparation procedures are ongoing in four \r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n4/22 16-35451\r\ndifferent cases and that the Trust Fund for Victims \r\nhas already assisted more than 300,000 persons, \r\nwith the provision of physical and psychological \r\nrehabilitation and material support. We commend the \r\nefforts aimed at enhancing the protection of witnesses, \r\nincluding through relocation agreements, and stress the \r\nimportance of the positive dimension of cooperation \r\nthrough strengthening national capacities.\r\nAs reported by President Fernández de Gurmendi, \r\nthe ICC has reached an unprecedented level of activity. \r\nIts workload is increasing significantly. In this context, \r\nI recall my delegation’s concern regarding the financing \r\nof Security Council referrals, an issue of structural \r\nnature that goes to the very core of the relationship \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations, particularly \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nOnce again, we reiterate our call for the \r\nimplementation of article 13 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement and of article 115 (b) of the Rome Statute, \r\nwhich provide guidance in the sense that such costs \r\nshould be met, at least partially, by funds provided by \r\nthe United Nations and not fall solely upon the States \r\nparties to the Rome Statute. It is equally important to \r\nhighlight that, as laid out in Article 17 of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, the General Assembly has the \r\nexclusive responsibility to consider and approve the \r\nbudget of the Organization. The proper funding of \r\nreferrals would enhance the credibility of both the \r\nCourt and the United Nations.\r\nThe current situation is neither fair nor sustainable. \r\nBrazil also notes that some United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations have been providing the Court with much-\r\nneeded support in the field, always in accordance with \r\ntheir mandate and basic principles.\r\nThe quest for peace and justice is always challenging. \r\nThis challenge is inherent to the search for a more just \r\nand cooperative world order. We are cognizant of the \r\ndifferent perceptions concerning the activity of the \r\nCourt. Let us not fall into the trap of operating with false \r\ndichotomies that seem to place peace in opposition to \r\njustice and sovereignty in opposition to accountability. \r\nRather, we should focus on the shared values that bring \r\nthe General Assembly together and have made the first \r\npermanent, treaty-based international criminal court \r\na reality.\r\nMs. Guillén Grillo (Costa Rica) (spoke in Spanish) \r\nMy delegation would like to thank Judge Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), for presenting the report on \r\nthe activities of the Court in the period 2015-2016 \r\n(A/71/342), pursuant to article 6 of the Relationship \r\nAgreement between the United Nations and the ICC \r\nand paragraph 28 of resolution 70/264.\r\nBefore continuing, Costa Rica would like to extend \r\nits sincere condolences to the Permanent Mission of \r\nChile following the sudden death of Ms. Elena del \r\nCarmen Bornand Pérez, a great defender of the Court \r\nand a highly esteemed colleague.\r\nThe International Criminal Court is without \r\na doubt the single most important achievement of \r\ninternational justice. It was born from the desire of the \r\ninternational community to end impunity for the most \r\nserious crimes against humanity and to provide justice \r\nfor victims. Its heart and its principal strength lie in \r\nits erga omnes jurisdiction. This is the same principle \r\nas the one enshrined in article IV of the Convention \r\non the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of \r\nGenocide and in the Charters of the International \r\nMilitary Tribunals of Nuremberg and Tokyo, as well as \r\nin the Charters of the International Criminal Tribunal \r\nfor Rwanda and the International Criminal Tribunal for \r\nthe Former Yugoslavia.\r\nBecause the aspiration for justice is shared globally, \r\nthe world needs for there not to be a single State in \r\nwhich impunity finds safe harbour. Accordingly, Costa \r\nRica welcomes the fact that our neighbouring Central \r\nAmerican country, El Salvador, became the 124th State \r\nparty to the Rome Statute, on 3 March. We would like \r\nto further congratulate El Salvador for having become \r\nthe first State to accede to the Rome Statute after the \r\nrelevant amendments were made to article 8 of the \r\nRome Statute and to the provisions on the crime of \r\naggression.\r\nMy delegation further welcomes the ratification \r\nof the aforementioned amendments of article 8 and the \r\ncrime of aggression during the period by Switzerland, \r\nLithuania, Finland, Macedonia, Iceland, Palestine, \r\nthe Netherlands and Chile. With 32 ratifications, the \r\namendments have surpassed the required minimum of \r\n30, which means that those amendments have entered \r\ninto force.\r\nTurning to another subject, my delegation is \r\nalarmed by the rejection of the Rome Statute by any \r\nState party thereto, based on the deeply held belief that \r\nsuch decisions only harm victims. Nothing should lead \r\nus to turn our backs on our common goal of providing \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 5/22\r\njustice and reparations to those who have suffered the \r\nconsequences of atrocity crimes.\r\nOn the specific issue of victims, my delegation \r\nacknowledges and welcomes the fact that the Trust \r\nFund and its implementing partners at the local level \r\ncontinue to provide assistance to more than 300,000 \r\nvictims in the north of Uganda and in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo in the form of physical and \r\npsychological rehabilitation services and material \r\nsupport to survivors of crimes under the jurisdiction \r\nof the Court.\r\nReturning to our common goal of putting an end to \r\nimpunity for atrocity crimes, it is important not to lose \r\nsight of the fact that the ICC is a court of last resort and \r\nthat it was not established to substitute for or replace \r\ndomestic courts. Responsibility for investigating and \r\nprosecuting crimes committed under their jurisdiction \r\nlies first and foremost with the legal systems of each \r\nindividual State. For that reason, complementarity is an \r\nessential part of the apparatus of international criminal \r\njustice.\r\nNonetheless, it is also essential to fully understand \r\nthat when the competence of the Court is triggered in line \r\nwith the provisions of the Rome Statute, States parties \r\nmust comply with their binding responsibilities that \r\narise from the Statute. Things have taken a particularly \r\nserious turn when non-compliance results in the refusal \r\nto provide the support required for the investigations of \r\nthe Prosecutor, thus impeding or making difficult access \r\nto evidence, which could derail the trial process and \r\nthereby create an opportunity for impunity. Similarly, \r\nthe fight against impunity is obstructed every time a \r\nState party fails in its obligation to execute valid arrest \r\nwarrants. The failure of cooperation also impedes \r\nproviding victims the justice they demand and deserve.\r\nNot cooperating with the Court under the pretext \r\nthat it is not impartial because a high percentage of \r\nits cases are found in the same region is unacceptable. \r\nThose who make that argument are trying to ignore the \r\nfact that the situations in Mali, Côte d’Ivoire, Uganda \r\nand the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and the \r\ntwo situations in the Central African Republic, were \r\nreferred to the Court by the Governments of those \r\nvery countries. Moreover, the situations in Libya and \r\nthe Sudan were referred by the Security Council. \r\nOnly 2 of the 10 situations — those in Kenya and \r\nGeorgia — had been initiated proprio motu by the \r\nOffice of the Prosecutor. Therefore, only one of these \r\nsituations is found on the African continent. It would be \r\ninconsistent with our common goal of fighting against \r\nimpunity and guaranteeing access to justice to call for \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor to reject referrals from \r\nState parties with the aim of maintaining a geographic \r\nbalance in its cases.\r\nIn the period included in the report, the Court had \r\nto deal with an unprecedented workload, including four \r\ncases that were in the trial stage simultaneously and \r\nseveral more in other stages of proceedings. I wish to \r\nmention two judgments of great relevance. The first is \r\nthe verdict against Jean-Pierre Bemba Gombo, whom \r\nthe Court found guilty of crimes against humanity \r\nand war crimes, the first case involving command \r\nresponsibility and the Court’s first conviction for \r\nsexual violence. The second was the iconic judgment \r\nin September in which the Court found Ahmad Al-Faqi \r\nAl-Mahdi guilty of a war crime for the destruction of \r\nhistoric monuments and sacred sites in Timbuktu.\r\nThe Court currently has before it 23 cases and \r\n10 situations, as other delegations have mentioned. \r\nIn order to continue fulfilling its mandate, the Court \r\nrequires the support and cooperation of the entire \r\ninternational community, particularly the United \r\nNations, which shares the ideals of accountability, the \r\nprotection of human rights and the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. It is for that reason \r\nthat my delegation would like to reiterate the need for \r\nthe United Nations to participate in the financing of \r\nthe referrals to the International Criminal Court by the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nGiven that the Charter of the United Nations confers \r\nthe responsibility for the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security on the Council, the Court, by \r\naccepting those referrals, is helping the Council comply \r\nwith its mandate. For these cases of cooperation, article \r\n13 of the Relationship Agreement between the Court \r\nand the United Nations, on financial matters, which \r\nprovides for the economic contribution of the United \r\nNations, should then be applied.\r\nIn conclusion, Costa Rica wishes to emphasize \r\nits full support for the International Criminal Court \r\nand its commitment to continue supporting the \r\nuniversalization, independence and integrity of the \r\nCourt so that, together with other States parties and \r\nwith the support of the community of nations, we \r\ncan together ensure respect for and fulfilment of \r\ninternational justice.\r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n6/22 16-35451\r\nMr. Logar (Slovenia): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt (ICC), Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for \r\nintroducing the annual report of the Court (A/71/342) \r\nand by expressing Slovenia’s strong support for the \r\nCourt and appreciation for its ongoing contribution to \r\ncombating impunity for the most serious crimes and \r\nstrengthening the rule of law. The report of the ICC \r\nbefore us affirms an unprecedented increase of the \r\nCourt’s workload, which yet again attests to versatility \r\nof its activities in support of bringing justice to victims \r\nof the most serious crimes.\r\nThe Court has continued its work on many \r\nsituations and has delivered important rulings in the \r\nfield of international criminal law. These include the \r\nfirst case involving command responsibility, which \r\nresulted in a conviction for sexual violence, and the first \r\nconviction for the destruction of historic monuments \r\nand sacred sites, which was also the first conviction \r\ndelivered on the basis of an admission of guilt. The \r\nreport further highlights the Court’s engagement in 10 \r\npreliminary examinations in nearly all regions of the \r\nworld, including Latin America, the Middle East, Asia, \r\nEurope and Africa.\r\nFurthermore, Slovenia would like to acknowledge \r\nthe progress made with respect to the reparations \r\nproceedings. Reparations to victims is an important \r\nfeature introduced in the Rome Statute system that \r\nhelps place victims at the very centre of this system.\r\nThe Court has also continued fulfilling important \r\ntasks to further improve its efficiency and effectiveness. \r\nThe effective and efficient functioning of the Court \r\nwith due regard for procedures of fairness is important \r\nto strengthening its credibility. Slovenia therefore \r\ncommends the dedication of the Court, in particular the \r\npersonal dedication of its President, in improving the \r\nCourt’s efficiency by, inter alia, expanding the Court’s \r\nperformance through projects designed to evaluate the \r\nCourt’s size and output.\r\nAlthough the ICC report highlights many of the \r\nCourt’s activities and achievements since the last \r\nreporting period, it also reminds us of several challenges \r\nthat it faces. Slovenia regrets the recent decisions of \r\nsome States to withdraw from the Rome Statute. We \r\nnote with equal concern that certain other countries \r\nalso have the intention to withdraw from the Statute. \r\nWhile a decision to withdraw from a treaty is a State’s \r\nprerogative, it is with concern that we have learned of \r\ndecisions to that effect. The creation of the ICC was \r\none of the most historic achievements in international \r\nlaw and human consciousness. The International \r\nCriminal Court is the first permanent international \r\ncriminal court. It offers hope and a chance of last resort \r\nto victims of atrocities who would otherwise remain \r\nunheard. Slovenia hopes that any decision to withdraw \r\nas a State party will be reconsidered.\r\nMy delegation acknowledges the importance of \r\nengaging constructively and openly on concerns that \r\nStates might have with respect to the functioning of the \r\nICC. We remain ready to continue to engage. We are \r\nalso convinced that the Assembly of States Parties to \r\nthe Rome Statute remains the most appropriate forum \r\nto engage in a dialogue among the ICC States parties.\r\nI would now like to focus on three key areas \r\nof importance: universality, the principle of \r\ncomplementarity and international cooperation. \r\nAddressing challenges in these areas through \r\nconcerted efforts and constructive dialogue on the \r\npart of the Court, but particularly on the part of States, \r\ninternational and regional organizations, as well as of \r\ncivil society, is essential to ensuring an effective and \r\nindependent Court and to achieving accountability.\r\nTurning to the issue of universality, Slovenia \r\nwelcomes El Salvador’s accession to the Rome Statue \r\nand invites other States to join. We further welcome \r\nthe ratifications of the Rome Statute amendments, \r\nincluding the Kampala Amendments and the article 124 \r\namendment. We welcome the fact that the threshold of \r\n30 ratifications of the crime of aggression amendments \r\nhas been met this year. The universality of the Rome \r\nStatute remains an important goal for Slovenia. It is \r\nonly through universal outreach that the International \r\nCriminal Court can truly develop to its full potential \r\nand avoid the criticism of being selective or unable to \r\nreach out to victims in need of its protection. Slovenia \r\ntherefore welcomes the call in the ICC report for \r\nencouraging further efforts by the United Nations \r\ncommunity to promote the universality of the Rome \r\nStatute.\r\nOne of the fundamental principles of the Rome \r\nStatute is the principle of complementarity. The Court \r\nis a court of last resort and will act only when States \r\nare genuinely unwilling or unable to investigate and \r\nprosecute atrocity crimes. The effective implementation \r\nof the principle of complementarity therefore requires \r\nnot only willingness, but also appropriate national \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 7/22\r\nlegislation, the necessary capacities and inter-State \r\ncooperation. Slovenia, together with Argentina, Belgium \r\nand the Netherlands, remains engaged in such efforts, in \r\nparticular through the initiative to adopt a multilateral \r\ntreaty for mutual legal assistance and extradition for \r\nthe domestic prosecution of genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity and war crimes. I would like to use this \r\nopportunity to invite other States to join over 50 States \r\nin supporting the mutual-legal-assistance initiative.\r\nThe Court’s effectiveness depends to a large degree \r\non the effectiveness of international cooperation, \r\nparticularly on the part of States, as well as that of \r\ninternational and regional organizations. Slovenia is \r\nconcerned that 13 arrest warrants issued by the Court \r\nremain outstanding — some of which have already \r\nbeen so for several years — representing a notable \r\nchallenge for the Court. Full and prompt cooperation \r\nwith the Court is an international obligation under the \r\nRome Statute. Instances of non-cooperation attest to \r\nthe need for additional efforts to improve cooperation \r\nin that field.\r\nUndeniably, the United Nations is a natural and \r\nimportant partner of the ICC. Slovenia welcomes the \r\nrich cooperation between the Court and the United \r\nNations, both with Headquarters, as well as with the \r\npeacekeeping missions and other United Nations \r\npresences in the field. In that respect, Slovenia welcomes \r\nthe conclusion of a memorandum of understanding \r\nwith the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in the Central African Republic. \r\nWe further recognize that mission mandates should \r\ncontain the authorization for the mission to support \r\nnational authorities in their efforts to combat impunity.\r\nGiven the powers vested in the Security Council, the \r\nCouncil’s support for the ICC is particularly significant \r\nfor the effectiveness of the Court. Slovenia therefore \r\nsupports efforts to further improve cooperation between \r\nthe Security Council and the ICC and recognizes \r\nthe importance of the full implementation of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations and \r\nthe ICC. Furthermore, Slovenia supports the initiatives \r\nurging members of the Security Council to refrain from \r\nexercising their power to veto in situations of atrocity \r\ncrimes. A veto in such circumstances not only fails the \r\nvictims of atrocities but affects the credibility of the \r\nCourt, which is then prevented from addressing some \r\nof the most urgent and devastating situations.\r\nIn conclusion, Slovenia remains firmly committed \r\nto advocating and promoting the rule of law and \r\ninternational criminal justice. The ICC is an important \r\ntool for the prevention and prosecution of atrocity \r\ncrimes and deserves our strong political commitment \r\nand cooperation, as well as our constructive and \r\nopen engagement in addressing the outstanding \r\nchallenges facing the Court, while preserving its \r\nfundamental principles.\r\nMr. Bin Momen (Bangladesh): Bangladesh takes \r\nnote with appreciation of the comprehensive report \r\n(A/71/342) of the International Criminal Court (ICC), \r\npresented by Her Excellency Judge Silvia Alejandra \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, President of the Court, \r\npursuant to article 6 of the Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the ICC.\r\nWe take note of the enhanced engagements of \r\nthe ICC, including the Office of the Prosecutor, and \r\nthe corresponding increase in the level and scope of \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the ICC. \r\nWe commend the recommendations put forward in the \r\nreport with regard to further strengthening the interface \r\nbetween the Organization and the Court for the attention \r\nand consideration of both State parties and non-State \r\nparties to the Rome Statute. It is critical that the ICC’s \r\nmandate and competence be recognized in relevant \r\ndiscussions and resolutions throughout the Organization \r\nwith a view to ensuring the acknowledgement of the \r\nCourt’s potential contributions to international peace \r\nand criminal justice.\r\nAs a State party, Bangladesh appreciates the \r\nwork done by the Bureau of the Assembly of State \r\nParties to the Rome Statute and that of its designated \r\nco-focal points in implementing its plan of action for \r\npromoting the universality and full implementation \r\nof the Rome Statute. As we welcome El Salvador’s \r\naccession to the Rome Statute, we share concerns \r\nover the decision or plan on the part of certain State \r\nparties to withdraw from the Statute. We hope that the \r\ninternational community’s collective commitment to \r\nfighting impunity and ensuring accountability for mass \r\natrocity crimes will remain unconstrained against the \r\nbackdrop of such developments. We urge both sides \r\nof the debate to exercise maximum restraint in their \r\nactions and rhetoric.\r\nIn an environment of growing conflicts and \r\nhumanitarian crises around the world, we underscore \r\nthe need for informed and continued dialogue among \r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n8/22 16-35451\r\nall States parties and non-States parties in order to \r\nuphold the sanctity, integrity and credibility of the \r\nCourt above and beyond mere political considerations. \r\nWe encourage the sustained attention of the Assembly \r\nof State Parties to the issue of complementarity, which \r\nwe believe to be a fundamental principle underlying the \r\nICC’s functioning as a court of last resort. Bangladesh \r\ncontinues to advocate for the ICC’s contributions to \r\nstrengthening national jurisdictions in the shared \r\npursuit of fighting impunity. It is critical that the varied \r\ncontexts in national criminal jurisdictions be borne in \r\nmind, and that the international norms and standards \r\nenshrined in the Rome Statute and exemplified by the \r\nICC’s judicial and prosecutorial activities be shared \r\nwith interested national jurisdictions with a view to \r\nfurther strengthening complementarity.\r\nIt is somewhat unfortunate that, while the least \r\ndeveloped countries constitute 21 per cent of the State \r\nparties to the ICC and account for most of the major \r\nconflict and post-conflict settings around the world, \r\ntheir share in the ICC’s internship and professional \r\nvisit programmes has been quite minimal to date. That \r\ntrend does not augur well for the critical importance \r\nof promoting transnational justice in post-conflict \r\nsettings, as well as for the capacity-building of national \r\njurisdictions to address impunity in the long-term in \r\nresource-constrained settings. Our delegation looks \r\nforward to addressing that issue through further \r\nconsultations, including in the context of appropriate \r\nbudgetary arrangements.\r\nBangladesh takes note of the progress made in \r\nthe investigations and judicial proceedings in relation \r\nto the ICC’s situation countries and the preliminary \r\nexaminations undertaken by the Office of the Prosecutor \r\nduring the reporting period. We recognize the need for \r\nensuring adequate resources for the Office to carry out \r\nits work in cases referred to it by the Security Council. \r\nAs a lead contributor to United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations, Bangladesh will continue to extend the \r\nnecessary cooperation to the Court in mission areas \r\nwhere our peacekeepers and military observers \r\nare deployed.\r\nBangladesh attaches great importance to addressing \r\nsexual and gender-based violence during armed \r\nconflicts and ensuring accountability and justice for \r\nsuch crimes, including as tactics of war. We take note \r\nof the first conviction for sexual violence by the Court, \r\nin what has also been its first case involving command \r\nresponsibility. Bangladesh reaffirms its readiness to \r\nshare its national experience in ensuring justice for \r\nvictims of sexual and gender-based violence and the \r\njudicial and administrative efforts taken to promote due \r\nrecognition and reparation for such victims.\r\nOne of the most compelling narratives emanating \r\nfrom the Court is the significant number of victims \r\nwhom it has been supporting through its determination \r\nto enforce reparations, as well as its Trust Fund for \r\nVictims. We underline the need for the sustained f low \r\nof resources to the Trust Fund and others.\r\nBangladesh takes note of the commencement of \r\nthe trial in the Court’s first war-crime charge for the \r\ndestruction of the religious and cultural heritage in \r\nTimbuktu, Mali. We will continue to follow the trial \r\nproceedings with interest.\r\nTo conclude, we reiterate the need to avoid any \r\nunwarranted measures that might render the legal and \r\njudicial proceedings of the Court susceptible to political \r\npressure or other exogenous considerations.\r\nMr. Manongi (Tanzania): The United Republic \r\nof Tanzania welcomes the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) (A/71/342) and thanks the \r\nPresident of the Court, Judge Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi, for her introductory remarks. We also \r\nwelcome the Court’s move to its permanent premises in \r\nThe Hague, which marks yet another important step in \r\nits establishment.\r\nThe Court’s report presents a picture of an institution \r\nthat is growing but also facing various challenges and \r\nopportunities. We see that fact as a trend that will \r\ncontinue to define the work of the Court and will \r\ndemand greater engagement from all of its stakeholders. \r\nThe Court came into being with the strongest support \r\nfrom Africa, following the considerable frustration and \r\noutrage over the genocide against the Tutsi in Rwanda. \r\nIt came into being as an organ with jurisdiction over \r\npersons responsible for the most serious crimes: \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity, war crimes as well \r\nas the crime of aggression. Humanitarian tragedies \r\nhad brought so much misery and aff liction to Africa \r\nthat the establishment of the Court became a source of \r\ninspiration in the fight against impunity and injustice. \r\nThat promise and hope are still relevant today, if not \r\nmore urgent.\r\nAnd yet, as a State party to the Rome Statute of \r\nthe International Criminal Court and member of \r\nthe African Union, the United Republic of Tanzania \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 9/22\r\nnotes that the Court has had a particularly tumultuous \r\nrelationship with Africa — one that has engendered \r\nfear of an African exodus from the Court. That need \r\nnot be the case for a number of reasons. First of all, the \r\nprimary foundation of the African Union Agenda 2063 \r\nis to promote a universal culture of good governance, \r\ndemocratic values, gender equality, respect for human \r\nrights, justice and the rule of law.\r\nSecondly, it is significant that in order to sustain \r\nthe momentum of strengthening gender equality \r\nand women’s empowerment, African Heads of State \r\nand Government declared 2016 as the year of human \r\nrights, with special emphasis on women’s rights — in \r\nthe recognition that peace and justice are indivisible. \r\nFor those reasons, we must at the very least encourage \r\ndialogue. It is therefore of concern that African countries \r\nhave come to be critical of the Court, to the point that \r\na policy of non-compliance and non-cooperation with \r\nthe Court is a real possibility. For the Court to remain \r\na credible institution in the delivery of international \r\njustice, it is important that there be confidence-building \r\nmeasures regarding its operations as well as its \r\ninteractions with all of its members.\r\nAll too often, avoidable misunderstandings, when \r\nleft unattended or dismissed as inconsequential, grow \r\ninto regrettable outcomes. Lectures or claims of moral \r\nhigh ground from outside Africa are, at best, unhelpful. \r\nThe recognition and overcoming of avoidable pitfalls \r\nassociated with new and evolving institutions, such \r\nas the Court, are essential if that institution is to \r\ncontinue to grow and become more robust. We must \r\ntherefore ensure that what is done today does not make \r\nmatters worse.\r\nWe must also make deliberate efforts to talk to one \r\nanother, remembering that what was needed to establish \r\nthe Court is not necessarily the same as what is needed \r\nto help it grow and discharge its mandate. We must \r\ninvest in building trust and confidence between the \r\nCourt and its members. As the Court’s work becomes \r\nmore complex and increasingly affects United Nations \r\nMember States, it must listen while remaining true to \r\nits mission.\r\nWhile the report claims that the capacity of the \r\nSecurity Council to refer a situation to the Court is \r\ncrucial to promoting accountability, it remains a matter \r\nof great concern to us that some permanent members \r\ncan use their position in the Security Council to refer \r\na matter to the Court, although they themselves are not \r\nparties to the Court’s Statute. The political nature of \r\nthe Security Council can also undercut the legitimacy \r\nof the process.\r\nWe recognize that, in most instances, the Court’s \r\njurisdiction is triggered when a State is unable or \r\nunwilling to deal with human rights violations on its \r\nterritory. It would be helpful if the primary task of \r\nthe Court were also to encourage and enable Member \r\nStates to develop their own programmes of justice \r\nand accountability. That effort must be promoted and \r\nsupported through additional investment.\r\nNo matter how current issues between Africa and \r\nthe Court are eventually resolved, there is no denying \r\nthat we must all improve our domestic legal and \r\njudicial systems so that they can deliver justice fully, \r\nfairly, effectively and in a timely manner. Effective and \r\nlegitimate States are also in the interest of all countries \r\nand people. States must be effective, not only because \r\nof the need to prevent ICC intervention in domestic \r\naffairs, but also because it is the duty of each State to \r\nprotect its citizenry. For Africa, the tragedies in Central \r\nAfrica, Côte d’Ivoire, Rwanda and Sierra Leone only \r\nserve to illustrate the risks and dangers that we must \r\nguard against.\r\nThe report also mentions the holding, in Tanzania, \r\nof the second Sub-Regional Seminar of Counsel and \r\nthe Legal Profession, in which the African Union and \r\nothers will participate. We welcome such opportunities, \r\nas they provide opportunities for building skills and \r\nexchanging information of value to parties and to the \r\nwork of the Court. Indeed, in 2012, the African Union \r\nHeads of State and Government established the African \r\nInstitute of International Law in Arusha, Tanzania, to \r\ncontribute to the strengthening of the rule of law within \r\nthe African continent. The Institute can serve as a \r\nbridge and useful forum for addressing the lack of trust \r\nand confidence felt by the African constituency of the \r\nCourt. The report also appeals for support for the Trust \r\nFund for Victims. Too often victims are easily forgotten, \r\nand it is proper that their needs be attended to.\r\nWe commend the establishment of the International \r\nCriminal Court Bar Association. We hope that it \r\nbecomes not only a forum for strengthening skills, \r\ncapacities and court procedures, but also an avenue for \r\nconsolidating legal norms and democratic institutions.\r\nWe note the Court’s continuing cooperation with \r\ncivil society, and we particularly encourage efforts \r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n10/22 16-35451\r\nto strengthen its relationship with civil society in \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nMr. Sandoval Mendiolea (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Mexico thanks Judge Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi, President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, for her presentation of the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (A/71/342) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly. The work carried out by the Court \r\ncontributes to the international rule of law and serves \r\nto strengthen the implementation of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 16 of Agenda 2030 for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which seeks to ensure peace and justice \r\nthrough strong institutions. That makes the presence of \r\nJudge Fernández de Gurmendi in the General Assembly \r\nmore relevant still.\r\nThe report submitted by the Court refers to \r\nthe progress made during the reporting period. We \r\nrecognize as a relevant development the conclusion of \r\nproceedings against Ahmad Al Mahdi for committing \r\nwar crimes by attacking historical and religious \r\nmonuments in Mali. That is the first case involving the \r\ndestruction of cultural property where the defendant \r\nhas pleaded guilty, which positively contributes to \r\nthe development and consolidation of international \r\ncriminal jurisprudence. With that conviction and \r\nsentencing, we have a total of four cases that are at the \r\nstage of reparations before the Court.\r\nThe current global context poses growing \r\nchallenges to the international community and adds to \r\nthe challenges facing the Court in fulfilling its mandate. \r\nThe cooperation of States is the main tool at the disposal \r\nof the ICC for the arrest of defendants, for the gathering \r\nof evidence and for the substantiation of proceedings in \r\ngeneral. However, the lack of cooperation on the part of \r\nsome States and the failure to carry out the execution \r\nof arrest warrants, for example, only encourage the \r\nevasion of justice and undermine the very objectives \r\nof the system. On the other hand, since the commission \r\nof the crimes falling under the Rome Statute could \r\nendanger international peace and security, the actions \r\nof the Security Council are crucial in carrying out the \r\nwork of the Court. Only in the period under review, \r\nthe Court referred three decisions on the lack of \r\ncooperation on the situations in Darfur and Libya to the \r\nSecurity Council, for a current total of 15 such cases. In \r\nthat context, we note that there are three dimensions of \r\ncooperation that should be taken into account.\r\nFirst, States Members of the United Nations \r\nhave an obligation to comply with Council decisions, \r\nwhich implies cooperating in situations that have been \r\nsubmitted by them to the ICC.\r\nSecondly, the Security Council must follow \r\nup effectively on situations referred to the Court, \r\nparticularly on those in which there has been \r\nnotification about the lack of cooperation by a State. We \r\nagree with the Court that the power of Council referral \r\nis crucial to promoting accountability, which should be \r\naccompanied by a true administration of justice.\r\nThirdly, the Security Council cannot tolerate \r\nsituations of impunity. On the contrary, it has the \r\nresponsibility to refer situations to the Court, following \r\nobjective and non-politicized criteria. We regret the \r\nlack of action on the humanitarian crisis in Syria, which \r\nhas resulted from the irresponsible use of the so-called \r\nright of veto, which prevented the adoption of draft \r\nresolution S/2016/847, introduced on 8 October (see \r\nS/PV.7785) by 46 States, including Mexico. The draft \r\nresolution appealed to the parties to the conflict to put \r\nan end to violations and abuses, which may constitute \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity within the \r\njurisdiction of the International Criminal Court.\r\nMy country, along with France, has promoted \r\na joint initiative directed towards the permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council under which they \r\nwould commit to refraining from resorting to the veto \r\nwhen the Council is considering situations in which \r\nheinous crimes are being committed. That proposal, \r\nwhich has been endorsed by almost half of the United \r\nNations membership, simply cannot go unnoticed.\r\nThe report of the Court refers to various activities \r\naimed at strengthening the capacities of States in the \r\nfields of justice and accountability, activities that other \r\nactors in the international community are undertaking, \r\nincluding within the framework of this Organization \r\nand its organs and agencies. As we stated earlier, those \r\nforums are most appropriate for that, because that \r\nallows those actions to be reinforced. It is not the role \r\nof the International Criminal Court to do that, as it is \r\nan international judicial tribunal and should focus its \r\nefforts on fulfilling its mandate under the Rome Statute.\r\nFinally, my delegation must refer to the recent \r\ndenunciation of the Rome Statute by some States \r\nparties. The universality of the Statute, enhanced by the \r\nrecent ratification by El Salvador, has to be analysed \r\nin the light of those developments. Mexico considers it \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 11/22\r\nappropriate, therefore, to redirect the discussion on the \r\nuniversality of the Rome Statute to a wider reflection, \r\ninvolving the organs of the Court. The fundamental \r\naim of that process must remain the strengthening of \r\ninternational criminal justice in order to preserve the \r\nspirit in which the Court was created, which we all \r\nagree is to end impunity for the most serious crimes \r\nof concern to the community international as a whole.\r\nMr. Li Yongsheng (China) (spoke in Chinese): I \r\nam pleased to make a statement at this meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, under agenda item 72, on the report \r\n(A/71/342) of the International Criminal Court (ICC). \r\nThe Chinese delegation thanks Judge Silvia Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi, President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, for her report.\r\nChina has always attached importance to the role \r\nplayed by international criminal justice bodies in \r\npromoting the international rule of law and in punishing \r\nserious international crimes. China has always actively \r\nparticipated in a constructive manner in the building \r\nof an international criminal justice system, closely \r\nfollowing the work of the ICC and participating as an \r\nobserver State in all Assemblies of the States Parties \r\nand expressing China’s position and views.\r\nThe Chinese delegation has noted that recently a \r\nnumber of African countries have announced, one \r\nafter another, that they would withdraw from the Rome \r\nStatute. We respect the decisions of those countries, \r\nand we also understand their long-standing concerns \r\nabout the ICC. It is thought-provoking that the Court \r\nhad received widespread welcome and support from \r\nAfrican countries at the time of its establishment, but \r\nis now faced with increasing criticism, opposition and \r\neven withdrawal by more and more African countries.\r\nStates bear the primary responsibility for punishing \r\ninternational crimes, eliminating impunity and \r\ndelivering justice. The Court serves as a complement to \r\nnational jurisdiction, and the Court should fully respect \r\nnational judicial sovereignty rather than replace it, still \r\nless become a tool for certain countries or group of \r\ncountries to pursue their own political interests. The \r\nquestion of how to exercise the power of the Court in \r\na prudent manner under the Rome Statute — thereby \r\ngaining trust and respect from States parties through \r\nthe Court’s objective and impartial conduct with a view \r\nto realizing the original intent of the Court — deserves \r\nour serious consideration.\r\nThe Chinese delegation has also noted that the \r\namendment on the crime of aggression had been \r\nratified or accepted by 32 States, and that it can enter \r\ninto force with the consent of the two-thirds majority \r\nof States Parties. The Chinese delegation believes \r\nthat the question of the crime of aggression bears on \r\ninternational peace and security. The Security Council \r\nhas the exclusive power to determine what constitutes a \r\ncrime of aggression. The Court’s determinations on the \r\nissue of the crime of aggression must be applied in an \r\norderly manner within the framework of international \r\nlaw established by the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nand can only have jurisdiction over States that have \r\naccepted the amendment.\r\nThe Chinese delegation would like to reiterate \r\nhere its support for the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to punish grave international crimes and \r\npromote the enforcement of legal justice. At the same \r\ntime, we hope that the ICC will strictly abide by the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and ensure that its \r\nefforts to uphold legal justice will truly be conducive to \r\npromoting peace, stability and national reconciliation, \r\nthereby making a contribution to the course of peace \r\nand justice.\r\nMr. Van Oosterom (Netherlands): The Kingdom \r\nof the Netherlands aligns itself with the statement \r\nmade by the observer of the European Union, but in \r\nview of the importance of the subject matter at hand \r\nand recent developments, we would like to make some \r\nadditional comments.\r\nThe Netherlands joins others in thanking President \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for her presence here today \r\nin New York and for her excellent presentation this \r\nmorning (see A/71/PV.37). We would also like to thank \r\nthe International Criminal Court (ICC) for its annual \r\nreport to the United Nations (A/71/342).\r\nLet me address three issues, namely, the fight against \r\nimpunity, current challenges and universalization.\r\nOn my first point, the Netherlands is deeply \r\ncommitted to the fight against impunity for genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes. That fight is \r\na cornerstone of the system of international criminal \r\njustice. The imperative to investigate and prosecute \r\nthose crimes at a national level is a key principle of \r\nall States’ legal obligations. The International Criminal \r\nCourt is the international community’s court of last \r\nresort in the fight against impunity. The ICC is therefore \r\ndoing an extremely important job.\r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n12/22 16-35451\r\nAs the annual report shows, the ICC has significant \r\nachievements to report this year. The landmark \r\njudgment in the The Prosecutor v. Ahmad Al Faqi Al \r\nMahdi case is a case in point. The internal working \r\nmethods of the Court have been improved, and that \r\nhas made the International Criminal Court even more \r\neffective and efficient. The Court deserves to be \r\nrecognized for its achievements this year and supported \r\nin its important work.\r\nThat brings me to my second subject, namely, \r\ncurrent challenges, which has also been addressed by \r\nother speakers today. The Kingdom of the Netherlands, \r\nas a State party and proud host State to the International \r\nCriminal Court, regrets the stated intention of South \r\nAfrica, Burundi and the Gambia to withdraw from \r\nthe Court. Some of those countries were closely \r\ninvolved in the negotiations on the Rome Statute and \r\nin the establishment of the Court. As the International \r\nCriminal Court is still a relatively new institution, we \r\nacknowledge that it is not perfect. However, we strongly \r\nbelieve that addressing any shortcomings of the Court \r\ncan best be done as a State party at the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties. We need dialogue with other States \r\nparties, not withdrawal.\r\nThe Netherlands acknowledges that withdrawal \r\nfrom a treaty is always a sovereign act, but we are \r\ndeeply concerned about the message that that sends to \r\nthe victims of international crimes worldwide. Those \r\nvictims deserve accountability, and they deserve \r\njustice. And they look to the international community \r\nto ensure justice through strong judicial institutions, \r\nboth domestic and international.\r\nThat brings me to my third subject — the need for \r\nuniversalization. The International Criminal Court \r\nembodies universal norms and universal values. The \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands emphasizes the duty of all \r\nStates to honour their obligations under international \r\nlaw to investigate and prosecute international crimes. \r\nWe urgently call on all ICC States parties to reiterate \r\ntheir support for a strong international criminal justice \r\nsystem and for a strong International Criminal Court. \r\nThe ICC is the world’s only permanent international \r\ncriminal tribunal. In that connection, the representative \r\nof Botswana said earlier that to withdraw from the ICC \r\nbetrays the rights of the victims of atrocity crimes \r\nto justice and that to withdraw also undermines \r\nthe progress made to date in the global efforts to \r\nfight impunity.\r\nSimilarly, we are heartened by many other \r\nstatements in support of the ICC by States, eminent \r\npersonalities and civil society, who point out that the \r\narc of history bends towards justice. Therefore, the \r\nNetherlands urges all States that are not yet a State \r\nparty to the Rome Statute to ratify the Statute. And we \r\ncall on States that have announced their withdrawal \r\nfrom the Court to reconsider their decision. We \r\nwelcome Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s statement \r\nthis weekend to that effect. We must make sure that \r\nthe International Criminal Court remains the strong \r\ninstitution in the fight against impunity that victims \r\nof atrocities worldwide need it to be. In short, the \r\nKingdom of the Netherlands reiterates the importance \r\nof universal ratification of the Rome Statute by all \r\nUnited Nations Member States. \r\nIn conclusion, The Hague is the proud host to a \r\ngreat institution, the ICC. Let us work together to make \r\nthis venerable institution more effective. Let us work \r\ntogether to make it more universal, countering today’s \r\nchallenges. And let us work together to let the ICC be \r\na safeguard for the people of the world, a safeguard for \r\njustice and a s safeguard for peace.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, the Republic of Argentina would \r\nlike to thank the President of the International Criminal \r\nCourt, our own Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, for the \r\nreport on the Court’s activities contained in document \r\nA/71/342. I am also grateful for the presentation of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s reports entitled “Information \r\nrelevant to the implementation of article 3 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court” (A/71/346) and \r\n“Expenses incurred and reimbursement received by the \r\nUnited Nations in connection with assistance provided \r\nto the International Criminal Court” (A/71/349).\r\nThe Court, through the laudable work that it has \r\ncarried out since its previous report, has once again \r\nfactually demonstrated that it is an essential tool in the \r\nfight against impunity and an essential element of the \r\nrule of law at the international level. In that connection, \r\nArgentina welcomes the fact that the amendments to \r\nthe Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court \r\non the crime of aggression have reached the minimum \r\nthreshold of 30 ratifications, thereby giving the Court \r\njurisdiction to hear cases regarding the crime of \r\naggression as of January 2017. Argentina resolutely \r\nsupports granting the Court that power as soon as \r\npossible, as it will cement the legal structure of the \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 13/22\r\nCourt and reaffirm the primacy of law and justice over \r\nforce in international relations.\r\nAt a time when some States parties have announced \r\ntheir intention to withdraw from the Rome Statute of \r\nthe International Criminal Court, Argentina renews its \r\nongoing commitment to the Court and to the universal \r\nnature of the Statute. To that end, we call on all \r\nstakeholders to engage in constructive dialogue with a \r\nview to addressing the problems that may emerge within \r\nthe Rome Statute system while upholding its integrity.\r\nAs for the follow-up to the Court’s legal and \r\nprocedural work, we are pleased to see that it has been \r\nable to carry out its activities, both in its preliminary \r\nreviews and in the matters and cases brought before it, \r\nthus fulfilling its mandate with the limited resources it \r\nhas been allocated. In that regard, we call on all Member \r\nStates that are States parties to the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to consider the nature of \r\nthe Court when it evaluates its annual budget so that \r\nthe budget can be approved at the next Assembly of \r\nStates Parties and the Court can fulfil its mandate and \r\nadequately discharge its essential functions. Similarly, \r\nwe urge those States to facilitate the streamlining of \r\nproceedings by approving the amendments to the rules \r\nof procedure and evidence drafted by the judges and \r\ndiscussed at the Working Group on Governance and \r\nBudget and the Working Group on Amendments.\r\nI would like to mention that the relationship \r\nbetween the Court and the United Nations is crucial, \r\nprovided the Court enjoys judicial independence. \r\nWe recognize the Secretary-General’s guidelines on \r\nnon-essential contact. Nevertheless, the relationship \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Court is also \r\naffected by the relationship between the Court and the \r\nSecurity Council, since the Council can refer cases to \r\nthe Court, and has done so on two occasions. Argentina \r\nhas voiced some of its concerns for years now, both \r\nin the General Assembly and in the Security Council, \r\nas a non-permanent member. Pursuant to the Rome \r\nStatute, once the Court is referred a case, it can claim \r\njurisdiction over nationals from both States parties and \r\nnon-parties to the Statute. Indeed, after a referral, no \r\nSecurity Council pronouncement can change the rules \r\nof the Statute regarding the Court’s jurisdiction in order \r\nto provide immunity to nationals of States not parties to \r\nthe Statue for crimes that fall under the Statute.\r\nI would like to reiterate that thus far, the financial \r\ncosts incurred by the Security Council when it refers \r\ncases to the Court have been borne exclusively by \r\nStates parties to the Rome Statute. The Statute itself \r\nprovides that the United Nations must bear the cost \r\nof these referrals, and that is also reflected in the \r\nRelationship Agreement between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court. Argentina and \r\nother Members of the United Nations have called \r\ninto question this regrettable situation in which the \r\nStates parties bear the cost of the Council’s referrals, \r\ndespite the fact that the great majority of them \r\nsupport the full implementation of paragraph (b) of \r\narticle 115 of the Rome Statute and article 13 of the \r\nRelationship Agreement.\r\nThe fight against impunity is an objective of \r\nthe States parties to the Rome Statute and of the \r\nUnited Nations, but it must go hand in hand with the \r\ncommitment to providing the Court with the necessary \r\nresources for it to discharge its functions. Inaction, in \r\nthat respect, could jeopardize the sustainability of the \r\nCourt’s investigations and could impact the credibility \r\nof the Organization.\r\nIn conclusion, Argentina stresses that the \r\nnoteworthy contribution of the International Criminal \r\nCourt to the fight against impunity for the most serious \r\ninternational crimes is also a contribution to furthering \r\nthe objectives of the Organization. We also highlight, \r\nas does the Kampala Declaration, the noble mission \r\nand function of the International Criminal Court in \r\na multilateral system whose objective is to promote \r\nrespect for human rights and attain lasting peace, \r\nwhile upholding international law and the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWe also reiterate Argentina’s firm commitment to the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nMr. Martín y Pérez de Nanclares (Spain) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): It is a great honour to address the General \r\nAssembly once again on an issue to which Spain \r\nattaches the greatest importance. The fight against \r\nthe most heinous international crimes is, without a \r\ndoubt, an essential component of the maintenance \r\nof international peace and justice, and it is also an \r\nunavoidable imperative that derives from the principle \r\nof the rule of law. To combat impunity, to bring the \r\nperpetrators of such crimes to justice and to do justice \r\nto the victims should be an inalienable goal of the entire \r\ninternational community. That is why I fully associate \r\nmyself with the statement delivered by the observer of \r\nthe European Union.\r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n14/22 16-35451\r\nBefore I continue, I would like to thank the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) for its detailed \r\nannual report to the United Nations for the period from \r\n1 August 2015 to 31 July 2016 (A/71/342). I would \r\nlike to offer a special, heartfelt thanks to President \r\nFernández de Gurmendi for her interesting and thorough \r\npresentation this morning. We congratulate her on her \r\nlaudable work at the helm of the Court. We also wish to \r\nthank Prosecutor Bensouda and the entire staff of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court.\r\nSince the beginning of the drafting of the Rome \r\nStatute, Spain has been a staunch proponent of \r\nthe role given to the Court in the difficult work of \r\nfighting impunity using the tools of international law. \r\nAdditionally, in 2010 my country actively participated \r\nin the Review Conference of the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court. In keeping with its \r\naims, the Kingdom of Spain deposited its ratification \r\ninstrument for the Kampala Amendments early, on \r\n24 September 2014. Without a doubt, my country will \r\nmaintain its long-standing, wholehearted and firm \r\nsupport for the work of the Court.\r\nDuring the period of work covered by the report, \r\nSpain’s Parliament approved a new law on immunities, \r\norganic law 16/2015, which in both its preamble and its \r\narticles expressly affirms Spain’s commitment to the \r\nCourt. Spain will never grant preferential treatment or \r\nimmunities to Heads of State, Heads of Government or \r\nForeign Ministers by citing ordinary law in an attempt \r\nto evade prosecution by the Court.\r\nThe year under review in the report submitted for \r\nthe General Assembly’s consideration was particularly \r\nintense and productive — 23 cases in 10 matters; 11 \r\nmatters submitted for preliminary review; a new \r\ninvestigation by the Prosecutor — an impressive \r\nrecord. The Court has achieved a good cruising speed, \r\nbut beyond a quantitative analysis — undoubtedly \r\nimportant — we would note that both the investigations \r\nand the reviews carried out by the Court are widely \r\ndistributed geographically, extending to four \r\ncontinents, to be precise. That is clearly a source of \r\npride and appreciation. It attests to the effective and \r\nefficient work of the Court.\r\nMy delegation notes with satisfaction that the \r\nthreshold of the 30 ratifications needed for the entry into \r\nforce of the amendments to the Rome Statute relative to \r\nthe crime of aggression was reached this year. As such, \r\nPalestine’s deposit of its instrument of ratification on \r\n26 June marks compliance with the first requirement \r\nestablished in the Statute for its entry into force. The \r\nnext step will be for the Assembly of States Parties to \r\nset a date for their activation. In that connection, Spain \r\ntrusts that the Assembly will be able to adopt that \r\ndecision with the greatest possible support from States \r\nparties. Moreover, it is essential to carefully study all \r\nmanner of implications, judicial and extrajudicial, of \r\nthe broader Court jurisdiction with a view to avoiding \r\nfuture obstacles to its implementation.\r\nBut, along with these positive elements there are \r\nalso worrisome elements. One very serious concern \r\ncannot be ignored — the International Criminal Court \r\nis going through a very difficult period, probably the \r\nmost difficult in its history. For the first time since its \r\ncreation, three States have announced their intention \r\nto use the withdrawal mechanism, provided for in \r\narticle 127 of the Rome Statute. As a result, effective \r\none year after the date in which the Secretary-General \r\nreceives written notification, they will withdraw from \r\nthe Court. Spain deeply regrets the situation and is \r\nconcerned about its possible implications for the future \r\nof the Court.\r\nIf such actions are carried out, it would set a \r\nvery negative precedent. Nevertheless, my delegation \r\nbelieves that the current role of those who resolutely \r\nsupport the work of the ICC should be more about \r\nbuilding bridges and being constructive and less about \r\nexcessive criticism and disproportionate complaints. It \r\nmay even be an opportune moment for all of us to look \r\ncritically at ourselves so that we can approach the future \r\nof the Court with renewed vigour. That is why we echo \r\nthe invitation of the President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties, Mr. Sidiki Kaba, to the States in question to \r\nreconsider their position.\r\nWhatever the result, the quest for universalization \r\nshould continue to be a fundamental and essential \r\nobjective. The same is true for the related principles of \r\ncomplementarity and cooperation. In fact, as regards \r\nthe latter, it is imperative to once again call for the \r\ncooperation of all with the Court — first and foremost \r\nStates, but probably also the United Nations, as it has \r\nthe power to improve the mechanisms with which to \r\nenforce the obligations arising from the cases submitted \r\nto the Court. However, that should not prevent us from \r\ncommending the important cooperative role the United \r\nNations is already playing. The Court’s report can \r\nattest to that.\r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 15/22\r\nIn conclusion, Spain highlights the vital importance \r\nof the International Criminal Court in the maintenance \r\nof peace, justice and the rule of law through effectively \r\ncombating impunity for the most serious crimes \r\nagainst humanity. We also reiterate our country’s firm \r\ncommitment to achieving that laudable objective.\r\nMr. Hahn (Republic of Korea): First of all, the \r\nRepublic of Korea would like to extend its sincere \r\nappreciation to the President of the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC), Judge Silvia Fernández de \r\nGurmendi, for her presentation of the comprehensive \r\nreport (A/71/342). My delegation also commends the \r\njoint efforts of the Presidency, the Judicial Division, \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor and the Registry in helping \r\nto put an end to impunity for the perpetrators of the \r\nmost serious crimes of concern to the international \r\ncommunity as a whole through various means, \r\nincluding the more effective and efficient functioning \r\nof the Court.\r\nIt has been 14 years already since the International \r\nCriminal Court was established as an independent \r\npermanent Court, in relationship with the United \r\nNations. The fundamental tenet of that relationship, \r\nas envisioned in the Rome Statute, is encapsulated \r\nin the reaffirmation of the purpose and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the preamble of \r\nthe Statute, which was actively followed in the actual \r\npractice of the Court. In that vein, and although running \r\nthe risk of being somewhat repetitive, my delegation \r\ncannot but emphasize the significant role that ICC has \r\nplayed through its work to sustain the three pillars of \r\nUnited Nations activity, namely, peace and security, \r\ndevelopment and human rights.\r\nSecuring criminal justice for perpetrators of \r\ngrave crimes that shock the conscience of humankind \r\nconstitutes part and parcel of the rule of law, which \r\nprovides a solid basis for the successful implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nBearing that in mind, we support the ongoing \r\ncooperation between the ICC and the United Nations at \r\nvarious levels, as stated in the report and presentation. \r\nThe Republic of Korea does not see the need to go over \r\nthe multifarious achievements of the Court thus far, \r\nespecially during the reporting period. Nevertheless, \r\nwe would be remiss if we failed to mention precedent-\r\nsetting decisions such as those relating to international \r\nattacks on religious and historical buildings, command \r\nresponsibility, sexual violence and offences against the \r\nadministration of justice.\r\nWhile the progress that the Court has made in its \r\npath to ending impunity is quite remarkable, the Court \r\nhas also been facing a harsh reality on several fronts. \r\nWith the help of various stakeholders, most notably \r\nStates parties, the Court should rise above considerable \r\nchallenges to firmly establish itself as a robust and \r\nreliable institution for international criminal justice. I \r\nwould like to elaborate on those challenges.\r\nFirst of all, given the sheer pace and scale of the \r\nincrease in caseload, it is imperative that the ICC enhance \r\nefficiency at various stages while not losing sight of the \r\nimportance of striking a balance between fairness and \r\nexpediency. In that regard, my delegation appreciates \r\nthat the Court continues to focus on streamlining its \r\nprocedures, as demonstrated by the publication of the \r\npractice manual of the Judicial Divisions, a useful and \r\ncomprehensive update to the previous practice manual. \r\nSuch initiatives are conducive not only to enhancing \r\nthe effectiveness and efficiency of the functioning of \r\nthe Court, but also to garnering the renewed support \r\nand trust of States parties. My delegation also \r\ncongratulates the Court on its relocation to the new and \r\npermanent premises.\r\nSecondly, as an international Court, the ICC \r\ncannot sustain itself without the active cooperation of \r\nmultiple stakeholders, especially States parties, at each \r\nand every step of the process. While the cooperation \r\nbetween the ICC and States parties is vital, it is also \r\nindispensable to the proper functioning of the system \r\nto secure cooperation vis-à-vis the Assembly of States \r\nParties, the United Nations and other international \r\norganizations, civil-society organizations and \r\nnon-States parties. Against that backdrop, even though \r\nit is regrettable that the ICC has been suffering from \r\ninsufficient cooperation for an extended period of time, \r\nit is encouraging that States parties, together with the \r\nCourt, have been relentlessly making efforts to develop \r\nvarious strategies and tools to cope with the issue of \r\nnon-cooperation.\r\nThirdly, the success of our common fight against \r\nimpunity hinges not only on adequate cooperation, but \r\nalso on the universal application of the Rome Statute. \r\nThe number of States parties to the Rome Statute \r\nhas more than doubled since its entry into force in \r\n2002, which is quite significant. However, it is deeply \r\nconcerning that the number of new entrants to the ICC \r\nfamily has been on the decline in recent years. Even \r\nmore disconcerting is that several States parties have \r\nwithdrawn over the past weeks.\r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n16/22 16-35451\r\nAt this juncture, my delegation would like to call \r\nupon the States parties that have already made or \r\nare considering making the decision to withdraw, to \r\nsincerely give it a second thought. There is a Korean \r\nsaying which reads: “In times of difficulty, recall the \r\nresolve at the beginning of the enterprise”. Other States \r\nparties and the Court also need to enhance outreach \r\nefforts to those States and exercise collective wisdom \r\nin order to delve into and address the real and perceived \r\nconcerns of those States. We cannot and should not \r\nafford ourselves the luxury of allowing the progress \r\nmade in humankind’s noble efforts to put an end to \r\nimpunity for the perpetrators of heinous atrocities to \r\ntake a reverse turn.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has been a steadfast \r\nsupporter of the ICC since its inception. As a member of \r\nthe Bureau, we are actively participating in concerted \r\nefforts to establish the ICC as a responsible, universal \r\nand efficient institution to end impunity for perpetrators \r\nof the most serious crimes against humanity. Let me \r\nconclude my statement with the reaffirmation that the \r\nRepublic of Korea will continue to spare no effort in this \r\nnoble and important endeavour at both the International \r\nCriminal Court and the United Nations.\r\nMr. Amolo (Kenya): Kenya takes this opportunity \r\nto recognize Judge Silvia Fernández de Gurmendi, \r\nPresident of the International Criminal Court. Over the \r\nyears we have continued to encourage the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) to expand its activities, enhance \r\nits work and improve its efficiencies and footprint so \r\nthat no country would have a privileged relationship \r\nwithin it. Kenya continues to engage robustly in \r\nencouraging and providing guidance to the Court \r\nto try and keep it faithful to our collective objective, \r\nwhile keeping it aligned with the letter and spirit of the \r\nRome Statute. As we carefully review the report of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (A/71/342) that is before \r\nus today, we cannot help but renew and underscore our \r\ndeep disappointment.\r\nThis session’s report is slightly more encouraging \r\nthan that of the last session. However, we continue to \r\nexpress our deepest regret that in a world consumed by \r\ndevastating wars and violent clashes, where hundreds \r\nof thousands, if not millions, of people have been \r\nadversely affected, that dismal output of tangible results \r\nis disheartening and simply confounding. Obviously, \r\nsomething is deeply wrong at the International \r\nCriminal Court. With only one new accession during \r\nthe reporting period, it is clear that the Court continues \r\nto enjoy the membership and support of only a small \r\nsegment of countries in the world. We take note with \r\nvery keen interest of the recent important developments \r\nwithin the membership and shall continue to actively \r\nmonitor the unfolding events. Like no other member \r\nState, Kenya has actively and intimately interacted with \r\nthe Court over the past few years and can unequivocally \r\nstate that something radical and urgent must be done if \r\nthe Court is to stand any chance of long-term survival \r\nas a viable and credible international institution.\r\nA cursory reading of the annual report may lead \r\none to believe that indeed some success is at hand. \r\nHowever, Kenya wishes to highlight a few pertinent \r\nissues, for we know and believe that the current \r\napplication of the Rome Statute is counterproductive \r\nand conflicts with its founding ideals. When we, the \r\nMember States, established the International Criminal \r\nCourt, we were convinced that we were setting up a \r\ncourt with higher standards of practices and procedures \r\nthan those found in our national jurisdictions. However, \r\ntoday we find ourselves saddled with a Court that has \r\nlower thresholds and standards than those found in our \r\nnational courts. That is simply unacceptable.\r\nTo illustrate that, paragraphs 49 and 50 of the \r\nreport mention ongoing investigations into the situation \r\nin Kenya. The integrity of the investigations in the \r\nKenyan cases has been called into question owing to \r\nthe alarming but credible revelations that the witnesses \r\nwere procured with promises of reward. The efficacy \r\nof that information, which is now more than eight years \r\nold and is still being received by the Court, is now even \r\nmore suspect. Furthermore, the revelations of witness \r\ntampering that led 190 members of the Parliament of \r\nthe Republic of Kenya to petition the President of the \r\nSecurity Council and the President of the Assembly of \r\nStates Parties, seeking their intervention in resolving \r\nthis, remains unanswered. Under the guise of judicial \r\nand prosecutorial independence, we have to date \r\nreceived no substantive response from the Court, \r\nthe Office of the Prosecutor or the Assembly. The \r\nstudious, calculated silence of some Member States is \r\nparticularly troubling.\r\nDuring the reporting period, 2,571 victims \r\nwere admitted to participate in proceedings before \r\nthe Court. It is Kenya’s experience that the issue of \r\nadmitting victims remains a likely avenue for abuse. \r\nWe are concerned that adequate measures are not \r\nin place to ensure that only genuine victims, and \r\nindeed witnesses, are included in the proceedings and \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 17/22\r\navailed the protections laid out in the Rome Statute. \r\nNotwithstanding the huge financial outlay and the \r\npressure on an already overstretched budget, we \r\nremain concerned that any attempt to raise that matter \r\ncontinues to be met by stiff resistance, again, under the \r\nguise of protecting the independence of the Court and \r\nits organs.\r\nAnother matter of concern to Kenya is that, save \r\nfor a casual mention in paragraph 83, the report fails to \r\naddress the very pertinent issue of financing of Security \r\nCouncil referrals. Despite the heated and sometimes \r\nunpleasant discussions we hold in the General Assembly \r\nannually, Kenya’s effort to have a genuine discussion \r\non this pertinent matter continues to be met by dogged \r\nresistance on the part of some States parties and some \r\nnon-States parties alike. Yet again, we find the Court \r\nunable to unshackle itself from the influence of a group \r\nof Member States, which continue to use their might, \r\nas major contributors to the budgets of international \r\norganizations, to block any discussions on the matter. If \r\nthe Court is to make any meaningful impact, the General \r\nAssembly must take its rightful place and address this \r\nproblem, notwithstanding any manipulation on the part \r\nof a country or group of countries.\r\nThe ICC was never intended to replace national \r\ncourts and is a court of last resort. Therefore, greater \r\nemphasis should be accorded to supporting national and \r\nregional initiatives. In that regard, African States have \r\ntried to engage constructively with the International \r\nCriminal Court with little success. Despite all our \r\nindividual and collective efforts to initiate and develop \r\nan enabling environment for constructive dialogue with \r\nthe ICC, that has not happened. We therefore appreciate \r\nthe cogent remarks of the representative of Japan, who \r\nsaid that “the ICC and its States parties should listen \r\nto the concerns expressed by the wider audience” \r\n(A/71/PV.37, p.12). The representative of New Zealand \r\ninsisted that Africa’s problems with the ICC “merit \r\ncareful consideration” (ibid, p.13). Yes, indeed they do.\r\nThe attempts of members of the African Union’s \r\nopen-ended ministerial committee on the ICC to meet \r\nwith the Security Council continue to be thwarted through \r\nan arcane, self-serving reading and interpretation of the \r\nSecurity Council’s rules of procedure. On the sidelines \r\nof the General Assembly high-level week in September, \r\na planned meeting failed to take place because of a \r\nmismatch in the levels of representation. It should be \r\nnoted for the record that, before this meeting was called \r\noff, the Ministers for Foreign Affairs of five African \r\ncountries were present at the appointed time and venue, \r\nin line with the established rules and practices of \r\ndiplomatic engagement, and were ready to proceed, to \r\nno avail.\r\nChapter III, section B, of the report is entitiled \r\n“Cooperation with and assistance from States, other \r\ninternational organizations and civil society”. Once \r\nagain, Kenya takes note of what is a glaring omission \r\nin paragraph 98, that is, the absence of any mention of \r\nthe African Union. We are convinced that the African \r\nUnion continues to be largely ignored by the ICC. One \r\nwould think that, as the bulk of the work is centred in \r\nAfrica, there would be a greater and more proactive \r\neffort on the part of the Court to increase its interaction \r\nand cooperation with the African Union and the African \r\nmember States.\r\nGiven the obvious lack of interaction, we can \r\nonly conclude that the ICC is not ready to engage \r\nconstructively with African States. That unfortunate \r\nstate of affairs must be discouraged. All well-meaning \r\nsuggestions of remedial action have fallen on deaf ears. \r\nThe representative of Tanzania made a very thoughtful \r\nand well-balanced presentation. He urged us to make \r\ndeliberate efforts to talk to one another — I may add, \r\nnot at one another. The representative of China urged us \r\nto respect the sovereign right of African States to make \r\ntheir own decisions.\r\nIn conclusion, this perfunctory report we have in \r\nfront of us fails to tackle the real issues facing the ICC \r\nand fails to offer any insight on possible pragmatic \r\nsolutions as we proceed. None of the organizational \r\nrealities and challenges that the Court has faced in \r\nimplementing its mandate are contained in this report. \r\nIt curiously lacks deep analysis and a well-thought-out, \r\nbalanced perspective. The continued silence of Member \r\nStates as we fail to identify the real issues affecting the \r\nICC and instead just gloss over them will undermine \r\nthe legitimacy of the Court. Kenya’s continued \r\nacceptance of the status quo would only undermine \r\nthe legitimacy of the Court and its core mandate — the \r\nfight against impunity.\r\nMr. Yaremenko (Ukraine): The International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC) is the only permanent international \r\ncourt established to put an end to impunity for the \r\nperpetrators of the most serious crimes of international \r\nconcern and thereby to contribute to the prevention of \r\nsuch crimes as well as to the progressive development \r\nof international criminal law.\r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n18/22 16-35451\r\nWe welcome the steady progress of the Court as \r\nit deals with more cases and situations than ever. We \r\nappreciate the ICC’s examination of the situation in \r\nUkraine in terms of crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes, following our declarations under article \r\n12, paragraph 3, of the Rome Statute, and we look \r\nforward to the outcome of its work. Ukraine also hails \r\nthe Court’s recent judgments on offences against the \r\nadministration of justice and the war crime of attacking \r\nworld heritage sites. It is important for the Court to \r\nbe able to intervene in situations where violence is \r\nunder way.\r\nMore specifically, the ICC must be able to fully \r\nexercise its deterring role, as Ukraine is affected by the \r\nhostile and aggressive actions of the Russian Federation, \r\nrendering thousands within the military and civilian \r\npopulation — including women and children — killed, \r\nwounded or gone missing, not to mention over a million \r\ninternally displaced persons. In that regard, we cannot \r\noverestimate the importance of States’ cooperation in \r\ncombating serious crimes.\r\nUkraine actively participated in the Preparatory \r\nCommittee on the Establishment of an International \r\nCriminal Court, signed the Rome Statute and was the \r\nfirst non-State party to ratify the Agreement on the \r\nPrivileges and Immunities of the ICC. However, the \r\nRome Statute provisions on the complementarity of the \r\nCourt were in contradiction to Ukraine’s Constitution. \r\nToday we are pleased to announce that the Ukrainian \r\nparliament has recently adopted a constitutional \r\namendment, paving the way for Ukraine to ratify \r\nthe Rome Statute. We are currently drafting the \r\nenabling legislation.\r\nIn that connection, we are particularly concerned \r\nover the recent withdrawal of a number of African \r\ncountries from the Rome Statute. We echo the \r\nsentiment of the President of the Assembly of States \r\nParties, Mr. Sidiki Kaba, when he said that the \r\ninternational community must remain united to face \r\nthe enormous challenge of preventing the commission \r\nof the most serious crimes and prosecuting the alleged \r\nperpetrators — whoever and wherever they are — to \r\nensure peace, stability and security in the world. The \r\ninternational community must consolidate its support \r\nfor ICC efforts to ensure universal justice for all victims \r\nof mass crimes.\r\nIn that context, it is of paramount importance that \r\n32 States parties have already ratified the amendments \r\nto the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt on the crime of aggression. We look forward to \r\na decision by the Assembly of States Parties to activate \r\nthe Court’s jurisdiction over such crimes in the very \r\nnear future. However, we regret the restricted scope \r\nof the ICC’s authority inasmuch as it would have no \r\njurisdiction over non-States parties or States parties \r\nthat do not ratify the amendment unless the case is \r\nreferred by the Security Council.\r\nStill, we put our trust in the Court, which has already \r\nestablished itself as an efficient universal mechanism \r\nto promote the rule of law and to ensure that the gravest \r\ninternational crimes do not go unpunished. By failing to \r\nbring those responsible for the worst crimes to justice, \r\nwe incite violence in the rest of the world. All those \r\nwho intend to commit the gravest international crimes \r\nmust be sure that punishment is inevitable regardless of \r\ntheir position or nationality.\r\nMr. Shingiro (Burundi) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to begin my statement by thanking the President \r\nof the International Criminal Court (ICC), Judge Silvia \r\nFernández de Gurmendi, for her thorough presentation \r\nof the annual report of the ICC (A/71/342), submitted \r\nthis morning for our review.\r\nMy delegation has taken note of and reviewed the \r\nCourt’s annual report on its work during the 2015-2016 \r\nreporting period, which was introduced this morning \r\nbefore the General Assembly, pursuant to article 6 \r\nof the Relationship Agreement between the United \r\nNations and the International Criminal Court and \r\nparagraph 28 of resolution 70/264. Before entering into \r\ndetailed remarks, my delegation wishes to reiterate \r\nBurundi’s commitment to the principle shared by \r\nmany — to fight against impunity in all of its forms \r\nand manifestations. Burundi also supports the principle \r\nthat impartial and equitable justice contributes greatly \r\nto the consolidation of peace and reconciliation within \r\ncommunities emerging from conflict. Moreover, \r\nwe are firmly committed to the principles of \r\nnon-selectivity, objectivity and non-politicization of \r\ninternational justice. In Burundi’s view, international \r\njustice as a complement to national jurisdiction is a \r\nnoble principle and one that must not be subjected to \r\npolitical calculations.\r\nSince the adoption of the Rome Statute, which \r\nestablished the International Criminal Court in 1998, \r\nand its entry into force on 1 July 2002, following its \r\nratification by 60 States, the Court has seen its share \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 19/22\r\nof highs and lows in carrying out its functions and \r\nin dispensing justice on behalf of the victims of all \r\ntypes of crimes. Despite its efforts in providing justice \r\nfor victims, we nevertheless deplore the occurrence \r\nfrom time to time and in various places of violations \r\nof the sacred principles that underpin the legal basis \r\nof the countries concerned and of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nI begin with the principle of complementarity of \r\ninternational justice, which is considered, as we know, \r\nthe backbone of the Rome Statute of the International \r\nCriminal Court. The Rome Statute, to which 124 \r\nStates subscribe, was never intended to replace the \r\nnational jurisdiction of the States parties. Once \r\nagain, we emphasize the importance of the principle \r\nof complementarity, according to which the ICC can \r\nbe seized of a matter only if the State concerned has \r\nneither the will nor the ability to prosecute those guilty \r\nof the most serious crimes committed on its territory.\r\nIt is not redundant here to recall that \r\ncomplementarity is at the core of the Rome Statute \r\nbecause the fight against impunity depends on efforts \r\nto build and strengthen the national capacities required \r\nto carry out investigations and conduct trials in cases \r\nof the most serious crimes. We therefore hope that the \r\nICC will finally recognize the jurisdiction of the States’ \r\ncourts and tribunals to try crimes committed on their \r\nnational territories. Moreover, we note — in what is \r\nan unfortunate observation — that the principle of the \r\nprimacy of national jurisdiction, enshrined in the Rome \r\nStatute, is not being applied as it should be in certain \r\nsituations referred to the Court.\r\nIn that regard, it is not surprising to see that the \r\nimpartiality and objectivity of the Court is being \r\ncalled into question by a growing number of States. \r\nPublic opinion in Africa has begun to see the Court \r\nas the juridical realm of certain so-called powerful \r\ncountries. We believe that African countries should \r\nreconsider their accessions to the Rome Statute \r\nbecause the International Criminal Court has recently \r\nbecome a biased instrument at the service of a category \r\nof countries, a tool with which to exercise political \r\npressure and, in some cases, to effect regime change in \r\ndeveloping countries, in general, and African countries, \r\nin particular.\r\nFurthermore, my delegation recalls that the \r\nselectivity, the lack of objectivity and the tendency \r\ntowards politicization which the Court has shown in \r\nits targeting of only African States and Heads of State, \r\nled to the convening of an extraordinary session of the \r\nAssembly of the African Union on 12 October 2013. It \r\nis clear that the ICC is focusing all of its attention on \r\nAfrica, while unacceptable situations in other parts of \r\nthe world go unacknowledged.\r\nWe are concerned by the fact that the ICC budget \r\nis more than 50 per cent dependent on the voluntary \r\ncontributions of Member States. This lack of a proper \r\nbudget seriously calls the Court’s independence into \r\nquestion, and it sometime finds itself overwhelmed by \r\npolitical pressure exerted by those most responsible for \r\nits financial straits.\r\nThe substance of my comments, which are by no \r\nmeans exhaustive, has recently compelled Burundi to \r\nwithdraw from the list of States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court at the \r\nexplicit request of the people of Burundi through a \r\njoint session of the two Houses of their Parliament. \r\nThe notification letter was officially transmitted on \r\n7 October to the Secretary-General, in accordance with \r\nthe procedure provided for in the Statute. We have duly \r\nnoted the requests of delegations addressed to States \r\nthat have recently withdrawn from the International \r\nCriminal Court, or are in the process of doing so, to \r\nreconsider their positions. Let me recall, however, that \r\naccession to an international treaty is an act that falls \r\nexclusively within the realm of national sovereignty. \r\nSimilarly, withdrawal from a treaty to which a State is \r\nparty is a sovereign decision and should not elicit the \r\namount of commentary from other Member States that \r\nit has.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation reiterates its firm \r\ncommitment to the fight against impunity in all its forms \r\nand manifestations. My country, Burundi, sincerely \r\nbelieves in the primacy of national jurisdiction and \r\nthe objectivity, non-selectivity and non-politicization \r\nof international justice. Until those principles are \r\nstrictly observed, the International Criminal Court \r\nwill have difficulty convincing all the States parties \r\nof its impartiality, as enshrined in the Statute. In the \r\ninterests of its survival and of international justice, the \r\nCourt should acknowledge its shortcomings and agree \r\nto a comprehensive reform, to meet the legitimate \r\nconcerns of various developing countries with regard \r\nto its functioning and its current policy of double \r\nstandards, which has affected several African leaders. \r\nIn the absence of such a structural reform, which we \r\nall desire, those injured States parties will have no \r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n20/22 16-35451\r\nchoice other than to call for the establishment of a truly \r\nindependent, impartial and equitable international \r\ncriminal jurisdiction, capable of resisting political \r\npressures from the so-called powerful countries and \r\nof exercising its jurisdiction in any country, regardless \r\nof the latter’s size, geographical location or level \r\nof development.\r\nMr. Medina (Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): My delegation thanks the President \r\nof the International Criminal Court, Silvia Fernández \r\nde Gurmendi, for introducing the annual report of \r\nthe Court (A/71/342) to the General Assembly, in \r\naccordance with article 6 of the Relationship Agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International \r\nCriminal Court, on the work performed by the Court in \r\nfighting impunity and promoting justice for the victims \r\nof crimes, in accordance with the Rome Statute.\r\nAs a State party to the International Criminal Court \r\nsince its establishment in 2002, the Bolivarian Republic \r\nof Venezuela champions and supports the strengthening \r\nof its institutional standing and effectiveness in carrying \r\nout its functions, thereby promoting its universalization \r\nin order to strengthen the rule of law at the national and \r\ninternational levels. In that regard, cooperation is an \r\nessential aspect in achieving the objectives of the Court.\r\nVenezuela supports the efforts of the International \r\nCriminal Court to ensure that justice and accountability \r\nare respected and that the Court can promote the \r\nestablishment of a comprehensive and effective justice \r\nsystem in accordance with the principles of autonomy, \r\nindependence, impartiality and objectivity enshrined \r\nin the Rome Statute.\r\nMr. Musikhin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): During the Assembly’s debate on resolution \r\n58/318 on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the International Criminal Court (ICC), the \r\nRussian delegation laid out a detailed account of our \r\nunderstanding of the problems within and around the \r\nCourt, which have unfortunately been increasingly \r\ncompounded in recent years. Without going into it \r\nagain, we will note only that the statements of a number \r\nof States about their withdrawal from the Rome Statute \r\nhave affirmed the validity of our opinions about \r\nthe Court. We urge the Court to look at the situation \r\nobjectively. It is time to move on from the romantic \r\nviews that prevailed when the Statute was being framed \r\nand to be realistic.\r\nThe decision on whether to participate in \r\ninternational treaties is a State’s sovereign right, and \r\nthere is therefore no point in trying to put pressure on \r\ncountries that withdraw from the ICC. The political and \r\nlegal reasons they give are understandable and should \r\nbe respected, and we are not hearing about them for \r\nthe first time. However, all of these States’ attempts \r\nto have their voices heard, and all their proposals for \r\nmodifications of the Court’s practices, including those \r\npertaining to customary laws concerning immunity for \r\nsenior officials, have been ignored. And yet for a long \r\ntime there has been good reason to look critically at the \r\nwork of the Court and analyse its shortcomings.\r\nThe statements made by the representatives of \r\nGeorgia and Ukraine are glaring examples of attempts \r\nto exploit the International Criminal Court for political \r\nand propaganda purposes. We have already commented \r\noften on the merits of such attacks. With regard to \r\nthe Court’s ongoing preliminary investigation of the \r\nsituation in Ukraine, we would like to draw attention \r\nto the shocking brutality of the crimes committed by \r\nthe Kyiv authorities and the radicals loyal to them. I \r\nshould point out that the source of that information is \r\nthe latest report of the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on \r\nthe human rights situation in Ukraine.\r\nTo give examples, the report cites horrifying cases \r\nof sexual and gender-based violence against both \r\nwomen and men by Ukrainian armed forces and law \r\nenforcement. I cannot bring myself to repeat in the \r\nGeneral Assembly the descriptions of the atrocities \r\ndocumented in the report. Ramrods, electric shocks and \r\nhot plastic are used as instruments of torture. Besides the \r\nsexual and gender-based violence, the report describes \r\nbeatings — in one case, a woman was beaten about \r\nthe head with a metal pipe — and threats of murder \r\nand rape, including of minors. In another instance, a \r\nman was arrested in a Government-controlled area in \r\nthe Donetsk region. He was taken a shooting range in \r\nthe basement of the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) \r\nbuilding in Mariupol, where he was beaten, suffocated \r\nwith a plastic bag, submerged in cold water and had his \r\nribs broken by a man who jumped on his torso. Four \r\nadditional verified cases from 2015 corroborate the \r\nuse of the Mariupol SBU building for incommunicado \r\ndetention and torture. Those are just some examples of \r\na series of crimes committed by the Ukrainian armed \r\nforces and law-enforcement authorities and cited in the \r\nreport. In general, the report notes that about 70 per \r\n31/10/2016 A/71/PV.38\r\n16-35451 21/22\r\ncent of the cases recorded by OHCHR involved torture, \r\nill-treatment or incommunicado detention before the \r\ndetainees were transferred to the Ukrainian criminal \r\njustice system.\r\nAt the same time, paragraph 64 of the report says \r\nthat OHCHR is “concerned by the lack of progress in \r\ninvestigations into the conduct of Ukrainian armed \r\nforces and SBU”. One example noted is the absence of \r\nany investigation into the 2 June 2014 aerial attack on \r\nthe Luhansk Regional State Administration building, \r\nwhich resulted in the deaths of seven civilians. As the \r\nreport notes, with regard to cases related to the bloody \r\nevents of 2 May 2014 in Odessa, significant pressure \r\ncontinues to be put on the judiciary. I want to emphasize \r\nthat all of this information comes not from the Russian \r\nmedia but from data collected by the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights, which operates in \r\nUkraine on the invitation of the Government. Despite \r\nall the shortcomings in OHCHR implementation of its \r\nmission, which we have repeatedly drawn attention \r\nto, even it could not ignore these kinds of facts. We \r\nshall see how the ICC responds to them and much \r\nsimilar information.\r\nWe would like to encourage delegations to think \r\nabout this information and take it into account, including \r\nwhen considering their positions on the draft resolution \r\non human rights in Crimea submitted by Ukraine in the \r\nThird Committee. Against the backdrop of lawlessness \r\ninstituted by the Kyiv authorities in their own country, \r\nthat draft resolution looks particularly hypocritical, \r\nand support for it will strengthen their belief in their \r\nimpunity and encourage them to continue to commit \r\ncrimes against their citizens and to direct hate speech \r\nat Russia and all things Russian.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item.\r\nSeveral representatives have asked to speak in \r\nexercise of the right of reply. I would like to remind \r\nmembers that statements in exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand to five minutes for the second, and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Yaremenko (Ukraine): I would like to exercise \r\nmy right of reply with regard to the statement just \r\nmade by the representative of the Russian Federation. \r\nI would first like to emphasize all of my Government’s \r\ncommitments on human rights. We take all cases of \r\nviolations of human rights of any kind very seriously, \r\nincluding those alleged to be by our armed forces. I \r\ncan assure the Assembly that we investigate such cases \r\nscrupulously and with the intention of bringing all the \r\nperpetrators to justice.\r\nSecondly, I would like to remind the Assembly that \r\nthe root cause of the situation in Ukraine is the Russian \r\nFederation’s aggression against my country. Two and \r\na half years ago, the Russian Federation occupied \r\nthe Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city of \r\nSevastopol. Since then, it has committed crimes and \r\nacts of aggression against my country in various parts \r\nof the Donbas region. My country invited the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights to come to Ukraine. We have provided every \r\nassistance to its Monitoring Mission there and have \r\nbeen entirely open and transparent where its work is \r\nconcerned. However, in contravention of the Mission’s \r\nmandate, it has had no access to the temporarily \r\noccupied part of Ukraine — that is, the Autonomous \r\nRepublic of Crimea. We therefore ask our colleagues \r\nfrom other delegations to support our draft resolution, \r\nwhich will be introduced in the Third Committee today. \r\nIts main focus is on access and reporting. That is it.\r\nI would once again like to emphasize that the \r\nRussian Federation is responsible for the aggression \r\nagainst my country, and that is the root cause of the \r\nsituation in Ukraine.\r\nMr. Alarsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): A number of statements  delivered to present the \r\npositions of countries on the report of the International \r\nCriminal Court have addressed to the situation in my \r\ncountry. They demanded, in a surprising manner, that \r\ninternational justice be brought to Syria and that the \r\nSyrian issue be referred to the International Criminal \r\nCourt. Regrettably, most of statements in which such \r\na demand has been made have been selective and \r\npoliticized. They spoke in conformity with the positions \r\nof the countries that delivered them with regard to the \r\nignominious terrorist war being waged against my \r\ncountry Syria.\r\nWe would have liked to have heard the voices of \r\nthose delegations in other international forums and \r\nplatforms of the United Nations calling for the fight \r\nagainst terrorism in my country, Syria, before coming \r\nto this meeting to demand that so-called international \r\njustice be brought  to my country. Some statements \r\ntoday have ignored the fact that many States criticize \r\nthe fact that the Court’s mandate is limited to  certain \r\nA/71/PV.38 31/10/2016\r\n22/22 16-35451\r\nStates and not others, and to certain cases, and not \r\nothers. \r\nThese statements even ignore the reasons that \r\npushed some States to withdraw from the Court, \r\nincluding the shortcomings in the Court’s work, its weak \r\nperformance and its weak mandate as a result of the \r\npoliticization of its works, and because it has become, \r\nlike many international bodies and organizations, a tool \r\nin the hands of some super-Powers that use the United \r\nNations and its agencies, bodies and other international \r\nentities to serve their own political plans. \r\nIf that is not so, who in this Assembly can convince \r\nus that there are States that signed the Rome Statute \r\nwith the right hand, and with the left an agreement to \r\ngrant immunity to soldiers of certain countries or a \r\ncertain country from the mandate of the International \r\nCriminal Court? Everyone knows to whom we are \r\nreferring when we talk about bilateral conventions \r\nsigned  by some States parties to a specific treaty in \r\norder to grant immunity to that State’s soldiers from the \r\nmandate of the Rome Statutes.\r\nI am not here to defend a particular position, but \r\nthe responsible attitudes of the Russian Federation, \r\nChina and other States in the Security Council have \r\nensured that Syria has not as yet ended up facing the \r\nsame bleak fate of countries like Yemen and Iraq. Who \r\ncan convince us that some whose brave voices we heard \r\ntoday in this Assembly talking about alleged war  crimes \r\nin Syria, but whose voices fall silent when the so-called \r\ninternational coalition forces in Syria commit crimes \r\nthat are actually war crimes against the Syrian Arab \r\nArmy fighting Da’esh terrorism and against Syrian \r\ncivilians who are bombarded and killed by warplanes \r\nof the international coalition — or what is wrongly \r\ncalled an international coalition against terrorism?\r\nMs. Agladze (Georgia): For the record, I would \r\nlike to state one more time that we have heard an \r\naccount from the Russian Federation that is once again \r\ndesigned to mislead the international community about \r\nits ongoing aggression against sovereign neighbouring \r\nStates, while Georgia, in sharp contrast, referred in \r\nits statement only to citations and conclusions from \r\nthe Pre-Trial Chamber decision of 27 January. As we \r\nsaid, we would like to reiterate that we are committed \r\nto cooperating with the Court in order to uncover the \r\ntruth and bring justice to the victims.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): \r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 72.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.25 p.m.\r\n"
