"United Nations A/71/PV.39\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n39th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 2 November 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 13 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields\r\n Plenary meeting to discuss action-oriented \r\nrecommendations to address the socioeconomic \r\nand environmental impacts of the 2015/16 El \r\nNiño phenomenon\r\nThe President: Since the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 70/110, on the global impacts of \r\nthe 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon last December, the \r\nlives of over 60 million people across our world have \r\nsuffered the devastating impact of El Niño. Extreme \r\ndroughts across Southern Africa have caused massive \r\ncrop failures, leaving millions of people without \r\nenough food. Catastrophic hurricanes have moved \r\nacross the Caribbean, devastating tropical cyclones \r\nhave battered the Pacific and South-East Asia, and, \r\nin Ecuador, widespread f looding and landslides have \r\nstruck communities.\r\nThe El Niño phenomenon has severely disrupted \r\nglobal rainfall patterns, leading to both disastrous \r\nf looding and prolonged droughts. The compounding \r\neffects of climate change and El Niño have seen an \r\nincrease in the intensity, frequency and variability of \r\nextreme weather events, hitting those countries least \r\nresponsible for climate change first and hardest. It is \r\npredicted that these extreme weather events will worsen \r\nin future.\r\nThe humanitarian impacts of El Niño have \r\nbeen profound, creating massive need across our \r\nworld, increasing food insecurity and malnutrition, \r\nexacerbating outbreaks of infectious respiratory and \r\nwaterborne diseases, disrupting health and education \r\nservices, upending livelihoods and forcibly displacing \r\npeople and communities. Meanwhile, the prospects \r\nfor achieving the Sustainable Development Goals in \r\ncountries affected by the El Niño phenomenon are \r\nbeing undermined.\r\nUrgent action is required. Comprehensive, long-term \r\nstrategies are needed to build early-warning systems, to \r\nstrengthen the resilience of vulnerable countries, and to \r\nprevent, mitigate and repair the adverse socioeconomic \r\nand environmental impacts. Humanitarian responses \r\nneed to be scaled up with financial, technical and \r\ncapacity-building support provided to countries and \r\npeople in need. Greater collaboration and information \r\nexchange is required, including through the collection \r\nand sharing of timely and accurate data between \r\nrelevant institutions and networks.\r\nImportantly, global awareness and an understanding \r\nof El Niño and climate change are also essential. To this \r\nend, I commend the Secretary-General for his prescient \r\ndecision earlier this year to appoint the former President \r\nof Ireland, Mrs. Mary Robinson, and the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Kenya, Mr. Macharia Kamau, as his \r\nSpecial Envoys for El Niño and Climate, and to give \r\nthem the task of bringing the message to the world. \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

As a recurring global phenomenon, \r\nrather than a one-off event, addressing the impacts \r\nof El Niño requires a comprehensive and coordinated \r\napproach. Implementing the Sendai Framework \r\nfor Disaster Risk Reduction, the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change are all critical to these efforts.\r\nLet us therefore commit ourselves to implementing \r\nurgently, effectively and at scale these global \r\nagreements and to addressing the socioeconomic and \r\nenvironmental effects of the El Niño phenomenon.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): Due \r\nto its geographical location and the characteristics of its \r\nterritory, Peru is highly vulnerable to natural disasters \r\nwhose impacts can affect the lives, development and \r\nlivelihoods of our citizens, in particular the poorest. \r\nThat is why Peru has a State policy for disaster-risk \r\nmanagement as part of our development agenda. Within \r\nthe framework of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction 2015-2030, clear global targets and practical \r\nmeasures for action are set out, thereby highlighting the \r\ncross-cutting nature of disaster risk management as an \r\nessential component of sustainable development.\r\nThe 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon was the \r\nstrongest since 1997. Thanks to the concerted efforts \r\nof the World Meteorological Organization and national \r\nand regional climate centres, it has been possible to \r\ncarry out preventive actions that greatly mitigate the \r\nnegative effects of this phenomenon. In Peru, the cost \r\nof the preventive measures adopted by our Central \r\nGovernment is estimated to be $505 million. Those \r\nmeasures enabled us avoid losses of $3.5 billion, which \r\nis equivalent to 0.2 per cent of Peru’s gross domestic \r\nproduct. The total losses during the 1982-1983 and \r\n1997-1998 events amounted to $3.283 billion and \r\n$3.5 billion, respectively. Those figures are equivalent \r\nto 11.6 per cent and 6.2 per cent of the gross domestic \r\nproduct in their respective years. In both cases, the \r\nproductive sectors, such as agriculture, fisheries and \r\nlivestock, were the most affected. During the 2015/16 \r\nEl Niño phenomenon, the agricultural sector and its \r\nfields were insured through a farming insurance plan \r\nthat covered more than 550,000 hectares of crops in \r\neight extremely poor regions in rural areas. Similarly, \r\nunder the plan, 525,000 head of cattle were covered, \r\nand 15,000 hectares of grass were planted to feed some \r\n265,200 animals.\r\nWe would like to share some of the lessons learned \r\nfrom the recent El Niño phenomenon with a view to \r\nensuring that our risk- and disaster-management policy \r\nreach all our people. Significant efforts are required to \r\nensure the implementation of the Sendai Framework \r\nand thereby achieve the goals of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. The main lessons learned in Peru in \r\nrelation to the 2015/16 El Niño phenomenon are the \r\nfollowing.\r\nClose cooperation between the Government and \r\nthe population is needed. To avoid further damage, \r\nmultisectoral action should be taken at all levels of \r\nGovernment. The implementation of disaster-risk-\r\nmanagement policies are necessary so that appropriate \r\naction may be taken. A monitoring system for detecting \r\nquarantine pests must be maintained. Joint cooperation \r\nwith neighbouring countries, such as our cooperation \r\nwith Ecuador, is essential. Adequate safety measures \r\nand productive infrastructure near riverbeds should \r\nbe set up to prevent overflows during periods of El \r\nNiño. Micro-reservoirs should be maintained to ensure \r\nthat water is available for agriculture and livestock \r\nduring droughts. Improving the accuracy of early-\r\nwarning systems with respect to reach, notification \r\nand awareness-raising of vulnerable populations is \r\nkey. To maximize resources, coordination with local \r\nauthorities is crucial. These are just some of the \r\nmain lessons learned by Peru in dealing with the El \r\nNiño phenomenon.\r\nWe also welcome the United Nations efforts to \r\naddress these challenges, such as the recent appointment \r\nof the Special Envoys of the Secretary-General on El \r\nNiño and Climate last May. Moreover, there has been \r\nan increase in international cooperation for developing \r\ncountries to complement the measures taken at the \r\nnational level to implement the Sendai Framework \r\nand, in the broader context, the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nMr. Cadena (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): The most \r\nrecent report of the World Meteorological Organization \r\non the El Niño phenomenon confirms that, in May \r\n02/11/2016 A/71/PV.39\r\n16-35686 3/3\r\n2016, we reached the end of the peak period for El Niño \r\n2015/16. El Niño affected more than 60 million people \r\nand their livelihoods and had an economic impact \r\nthat even now is difficult to measure. Individuals \r\nand families who depend on agriculture, fisheries \r\nand livestock were particularly affected. The weather \r\nforecasts show a high probability of a weakening of \r\nLa Niña in 2016 and almost no chance of a significant \r\nepisode of El Niño during 2016 and 2017.\r\nIn our region of Central America, countries and \r\ntowns were particularly affected by one of the most \r\nserious droughts in the region’s history. In general, \r\nthere were serious effects on harvest crop volumes and \r\nroad infrastructure, which led to substantial losses in \r\ncrops and livestock, affecting food security throughout \r\nthe region.\r\nThe Government of Ecuador addressed and \r\nreduced the adverse effects of the El Niño phenomenon \r\n2015/16 by designing, implementing and launching six \r\nmultipurpose projects over nine years through public \r\ninvestment, amounting to more than $1.1 billion, in order \r\nto protect citizens and their livelihoods from winter \r\nf loods by means of creating reservoirs to ensure that \r\nwater is available for drinking, irrigation and renewable \r\nenergies. More than 142,000 hectares of crops have \r\nbeen protected. The ongoing implementation of public \r\nprogrammes for the control of insect-borne diseases, \r\nsuch as zika, dengue and chikungunya, along with the \r\nmaintenance and regular cleaning of drainage canals, \r\nhas visibly reduced the impact on our population.\r\nIt is worth noting that the Government of Ecuador \r\nhas undertaken several actions in coordination with \r\nlocal governments, civil society and communities \r\nto strengthen the State’s capacity to respond to \r\nnatural disasters, always through an inclusive risk-\r\nmanagement approach and by using an innovative \r\ngeoreferencing process for people with disabilities in \r\nareas of influence, in order to identify persons with \r\ndisabilities and develop a family emergency plan that \r\nensures timely attention to a possible emergency due \r\nto the adverse effects of the phenomenon. We believe \r\nthat these early actions allowed us to ensure the safety \r\nof thousands of individuals and their livelihoods and \r\nrepresented a savings of more than $300 million in 2015-\r\n2016 by protecting cultivated land, crops, livestock and \r\ninfrastructure, inter alia. We stress, however, that the \r\neffects of the devastating earthquake with a magnitude \r\nof 6.8 on the Richter scale that hit several regions in our \r\ncountry on 16 April 2016 exacerbated the challenges \r\nfor the Government and in particular for the coastal \r\npopulation of my country.\r\nEcuador recognizes the importance of \r\nhumanitarian assistance for countries that were among \r\nthe most affected by El Niño phenomenon in 2015/16, \r\nand we believe the time has come to look beyond the \r\nmere humanitarian consideration of the effects of \r\nthe phenomenon and undertake early activities for \r\nstrengthening institutional capacities in the affected \r\ncountries in order to respond adequately and in a timely \r\nmanner to these effects. Ecuador thanks the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his report on the implementation of the \r\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-\r\n2030 (A/71/230), which includes a section on measures \r\nto address the socioeconomic and environmental effects \r\nof El Niño, and welcomes the appointment of Mrs. Mary \r\nRobinson and Mr. Macharia Kamau as Special Envoys \r\non El Niño and Climate. We commend the Economic \r\nand Social Council for organizing the high-level event \r\non this issue on 6 May 2016.\r\nThe relevance of this issue demands an ongoing \r\ndiscussion on the progress achieved at the global level. \r\nEcuador believes that tackling the adverse effects \r\nof natural events that develop gradually constitutes \r\nan appropriate situation for the agencies responsible \r\nfor promoting development to coordinate activities \r\nin order to provide comprehensive action-oriented \r\nrecommendations and solid proposals that incorporate \r\nelements of science, technology, innovation and \r\nresilient infrastructure for the countries most affected \r\nin a timely manner and while continuing and increasing \r\nthe necessary humanitarian assistance efforts. The \r\nEcuador urges the relevant entities to be proactive, \r\nact holistically and take early action, and not just \r\nreact to the challenge of El Niño. To that end, Ecuador \r\nappreciates the attention paid by Member States and \r\nnotes with interest their action-oriented statements and \r\nrecommendations.\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker \r\nin this plenary meeting to discuss action-oriented \r\nrecommendations to address the socioeconomic \r\nand environmental impacts of the 2015/16 El \r\nNiño phenomenon.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 13.\r\nThe meeting rose at 10.35 a.m.\r\n"
