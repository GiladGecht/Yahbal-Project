The present membership of the Commission \r\nis set out in the annex to document A/71/90. The notes \r\nby the Secretary-General concerning the candidates are \r\ncontained in documents A/71/90 and addenda 1 to 6.\r\nMembers will recall that the Assembly, at its \r\n25th plenary meeting, on 6 October 2016, decided to \r\nrequest that the Secretary-General issue a consolidated \r\nlist, incorporating new candidates and additional \r\ninformation on candidates received subsequent to the \r\ndeadline for the submission of nominations. In that \r\nconnection, the Assembly now has before it the note \r\nby the Secretary-General circulated as document \r\nA/71/437 and its corrigendum 1, which consolidates, \r\nin alphabetical order, the candidates nominated by \r\nGovernments of States Members of the United Nations \r\nfor election to the International Law Commission.\r\nI should like to inform the Assembly that, as \r\nindicated in document A/71/90/Add.6, the Permanent \r\nMission of Libya to the United Nations indicated, \r\nin a note verbale dated 27 October 2016, that it had \r\nwithdrawn the candidature of Mr. Abdelrazeg el-\r\nMurtadi Suleiman Gouider to the International Law \r\nCommission. In addition, the Permanent Mission of the \r\nSudan to the United Nations informed the Secretariat, \r\nin a note verbale dated 1 November 2016, of the \r\nwithdrawal of Mr. Muaz Ahmed Tungo for election to \r\nthe International Law Commission; and the Permanent \r\nMission of Burundi to the United Nations, in a note \r\nverbale dated 2 November 2016, informed the Secretariat \r\nof the withdrawal of Mr. Révérien Habarugira for \r\nelection to the International Law Commission. A total \r\nof 46 candidates are therefore eligible in this election.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-35918 (E)\r\n*1635918*\r\nA/71/PV.40 03/11/2016\r\n2/4 16-35918\r\nThe notes by the Secretary-General concerning the \r\nstatements of qualifications of candidates are contained \r\nin documents A/71/83 and its addendum 1.\r\nI should like to recall for members that, in \r\naccordance with the statute of the International Law \r\nCommission, the Commission should consist of \r\npersons of recognized competence in international law; \r\nthe persons to be elected to the Commission should \r\nindividually possess the qualifications required; and in \r\nthe Commission as a whole, representation of the main \r\nforms of civilization and of the principal legal systems \r\nof the world should be ensured.\r\nPursuant to paragraph 3 of resolution 36/39, of \r\n18 November 1981, the 34 members should be elected \r\nas follows: eight nationals from African States; seven \r\nnationals from Asia-Pacific States; four nationals from \r\nEastern European States; seven nationals from Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States; and eight nationals \r\nfrom Western European and other States. The ballot \r\npapers reflect that pattern.\r\nAs provided for in the statute of the International \r\nLaw Commission, those candidates, up to the maximum \r\nnumber prescribed for each regional group, receiving \r\nthe greatest number of votes and not less than a majority \r\nof the votes of the Member States present and voting, \r\nshall be declared elected.\r\nIf the number of candidates obtaining a simple \r\nmajority is less than the number of members to be \r\nelected, there shall be additional ballots to fill the \r\nremaining places, the voting being restricted to the \r\ncandidates obtaining the greatest number of votes in \r\nthe previous ballot to a number not more than twice the \r\nplaces remaining to be filled.\r\nAlso, consistent with past practice, if, in the case \r\nof a tie vote, it becomes necessary to determine the \r\ncandidate to be elected or to proceed to the next round \r\nof restricted balloting, there will be a special restricted \r\nballot limited to the candidates who have obtained an \r\nequal number of votes.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthese procedures?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with rule 92 \r\nof the rules of procedure of the General Assembly, the \r\nelection shall be held by secret ballot. Before we begin \r\nthe voting process, I should like to remind members \r\nthat, pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of procedure of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, no representative shall interrupt the \r\nvoting except on a point of order on the actual conduct \r\nof the voting. In addition, ballot papers will be given \r\nonly to the representative seated directly behind the \r\ncountry’s nameplate.\r\nI would like to seek the usual cooperation of \r\nrepresentatives during the time of the conduct of the \r\nelection and to remind them that during the voting \r\nprocess, all campaigning should cease in the General \r\nAssembly Hall. That means, in particular, that once the \r\nmeeting has begun, no more campaign material may be \r\ndistributed inside the Hall.\r\nAll representatives are also requested to remain at \r\ntheir seats so that the voting process can proceed in an \r\norderly manner. I thank them for their cooperation.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected.\r\nBallot papers marked “A”, “B”, “C”, “D” and “E” \r\nwill now be distributed. Representatives are requested to \r\nuse only those ballot papers that have been distributed. \r\nEach ballot paper contains the names of the candidates \r\neligible in this round of balloting.\r\nRepresentatives are requested to place a cross to \r\nthe left of the names of the candidates for whom they \r\nwish to vote. Representatives may vote only for those \r\ncandidates whose names appear on the ballot papers, \r\nand for no more than the number of seats allocated to \r\neach region. A ballot paper containing more votes than \r\nthe number of seats allocated to the relevant region will \r\nbe declared invalid.\r\nAccordingly, members should ensure that the ballot \r\npapers marked “A” for African States do not contain \r\nvotes for more than eight candidates; that the ballot \r\npapers marked “B” for Asia-Pacific States do not \r\ncontain votes for more than seven candidates; that the \r\nballot papers marked “C” for Eastern European States \r\ndo not contain votes for more than four candidates; that \r\nthe ballot papers marked “D” for Latin American and \r\nCaribbean States do not contain votes for more than \r\nseven candidates; and that the ballot papers marked “E” \r\nfor Western European and other States do not contain \r\nvotes for more than eight candidates.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, \r\nMr. Rosa (Angola), Mr. Hajiyev (Azerbaijan), \r\nMs. Hung (Canada), Mrs. Le Diffard (Hungary), \r\n03/11/2016 A/71/PV.40\r\n16-35918 3/4\r\nMrs. Rolón Candia (Paraguay), Mr. Guisse \r\n(Senegal), Ms. Eymann (Switzerland), Mr. Alshamsi \r\n(United Arab Emirates) and Mr. Pérez Ayestarán \r\n(Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 3.25 p.m. and \r\nresumed at 6 p.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nGroup A — African States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  193\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  193\r\nAbstentions:  0\r\nNumber of members voting:  193\r\nRequired simple majority:  97\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nMr. Ahmed Laraba (Algeria)  160\r\nMr. Yacouba Cissé (Côte d’Ivoire)  156\r\nMr. Dire Tladi (South Africa)  153\r\nMr. Chris Maina Peter (United Republic\r\nof Tanzania)  146\r\nMr. Hussein Hassouna (Egypt)  143\r\nMr. Amos Wako (Kenya)  140\r\nMr. Charles C.
