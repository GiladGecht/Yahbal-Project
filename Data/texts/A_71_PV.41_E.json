"United Nations A/71/PV.41\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n41st plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 4 November 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 63\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council\r\nReport of the Human Rights Council (A/71/53, \r\nA/71/53/Add.1 and A/71/53/Add.2)\r\nThe President: In connection with this item, I \r\nwould like to recall that at its 2nd plenary meeting, \r\non 16 September 2016, the General Assembly decided \r\nto consider agenda item 63 in plenary meeting and in \r\nthe Third Committee pursuant to resolution 65/281, of \r\n17 June 2011.\r\nIf members permit me, I shall now make a statement.\r\nI would like to begin by welcoming to the General \r\nAssembly Ambassador Choi Kyonglim, President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council. I would also like to take \r\nthis opportunity to congratulate once again the 14 \r\nnew members of the Human Rights Council that were \r\nelected by the General Assembly last week.\r\nFor the Human Rights Council, 2016 has been a \r\nlandmark year. As the international community has \r\ncommemorated the tenth anniversary of the Council’s \r\nestablishment and has had an opportunity to reflect on \r\nits achievements, we have considered its pre-eminent \r\nplace in the global human rights architecture. By any \r\nmeasure, it is clear that the Human Rights Council has \r\nplayed a critical role in promoting the universality, \r\ninterdependence and indivisibility of all human rights. \r\nIt has resolutely strengthened our collective efforts to \r\nprotect human rights across our world.\r\nThe comprehensive and interconnected human rights \r\nmechanisms that the Council oversees — including the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR), special procedures \r\nmandate-holders and treaty bodies — have put the \r\nCouncil at the forefront of our work to uphold existing \r\nhuman rights standards. They have allowed us to \r\nenvironment stablish new norms, provide accountability \r\nand remedies for violations and ensure that the human \r\nrights dimensions of emerging challenges are elevated \r\nand understood. Time and again, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil has shone a light on human rights violations \r\nacross our world and brought global attention to gross \r\nand systematic violations requiring urgent action by the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Universal Periodic Review has been central \r\nto the Council’s success. The UPR is based on the \r\nfundamental premise of equal treatment of nations \r\nand of enabling all Member States to engage with \r\none another on an equal footing in order to improve \r\nhuman rights in all countries. The open and inclusive \r\nnature of the Universal Periodic Review process has \r\nbeen fundamental to its credibility, and I welcome \r\nthe participation of civil society, national human \r\nrights institutions, academia and other human rights \r\ndefenders in these processes. To that end, I encourage \r\nall Member States to do all that they can to enable civil \r\nsociety to conduct its work freely in our societies and to \r\nparticipate fully in human rights mechanisms.\r\nAs global attention shifts towards the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, we should all recognize that the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-36139 (E)\r\n*1636139*\r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n2/29 16-36139\r\nGoals is the best way to enable all people to realize \r\ntheir rights. Indeed, the 2030 Agenda is premised on \r\nthe fundamental recognition of human rights for all \r\npeople, and, if it is implemented effectively, will allow \r\nus to build peaceful and inclusive societies, empower \r\nwomen and girls, tackle discrimination and inequality, \r\nend exploitation, trafficking and torture and promote \r\nthe rule of law, eliminate extreme poverty and combat \r\nclimate change.\r\nThe Human Rights Council has a central role to play \r\nin promoting the human rights dimensions of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Ensuring that \r\nimplementation of the Agenda is pursued in a manner \r\nconsistent with international human rights standards \r\ndemands attention from all of us.\r\nWhile important progress has been made on \r\nhumankind’s behalf by the Human Rights Council, it is \r\nclear that much more work remains to be done. In the \r\ndecade ahead, we must stand firm in our support of the \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council, however difficult \r\nthat may be for some of us from time to time. It will be \r\nessential that the Council remain visible and credible, \r\nretain its universal character and continue in its central \r\nrole in the United Nations architecture.\r\nSafeguarding the human rights of the people of \r\nour world requires vigilance and universality. I leave \r\nmembers with Nelson Mandela’s famous words:\r\n“[t]o deny people their human rights is to challenge \r\ntheir very humanity”.\r\nIn accordance with resolution 65/281, of 17 June \r\n2011, I now give the f loor to His Excellency Mr. Choi \r\nKyonglim, President of the Human Rights Council.\r\nMr. Choi Kyonglim: It is a great pleasure and an \r\nhonour for me to come before the General Assembly \r\ntoday to present the annual report (A/71/53) of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Please allow me to first take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate the newly elected members \r\nof the Council. I am sure that all the new members will \r\nmake a significant contribution to advancing the shared \r\ngoal of all Council members, that is, the promotion and \r\nprotection of the human rights of all.\r\nWe began 2016 with hope and optimism and a \r\ncommon resolve to build a safer world and better future \r\nfor all. Regrettably, though, we have moved through the \r\nyear faced with ongoing, as well as emerging, armed \r\nconflicts, humanitarian crises, terrorist attacks and \r\nother events that shake our notions of security, human \r\nrights, peace and stability. We have witnessed that key \r\nchallenges for the international community — from \r\nreligious confrontations to military provocations, to \r\nthe refugee crisis — will not easily go away. And the \r\nhuman rights situation in the world is deteriorating \r\nbefore our eyes.\r\nOn one level, it is clear that many, if not all, of these \r\nchallenges f low from a failure on the part of States, \r\nand increasingly non-State actors as well, to respect, \r\nprotect and uphold international human rights norms. \r\nOn another level, during such periods of uncertainty \r\nand insecurity, human rights violations and abuses \r\nbecome more likely and more frequent, thereby further \r\nundermining security and heightening vulnerability.\r\nAgainst this challenging and complex backdrop, \r\nthe Human Rights Council has worked hard to fulfil \r\nits mandate as the premier United Nations forum for \r\nhuman rights. The record and achievements of the \r\nCouncil since its establishment are a testimony to its \r\nresponsiveness and f lexibility in dealing with human \r\nrights issues all over the world. This year alone, \r\nthe Human Rights Council adopted a total of 149 \r\nresolutions, decisions and President’s statements. Of \r\nthose, 114 were adopted without a vote. Many of the \r\nresolutions, including on country-specific issues, were \r\ncross-regional initiatives, affirming the capacity of \r\nthe Council to overcome political differences and take \r\nunified action on important human rights issues.\r\nSyria continued to be high on the agenda of the \r\nHuman Rights Council throughout the year. The \r\nCouncil extended the mandate of the Commission of \r\nInquiry once again, and just two weeks ago the Council \r\nheld a special session on the deteriorating situation \r\nof human rights in Syria and the recent situation in \r\nAleppo. During the twenty-fifth special session, the \r\nHuman Rights Council requested the Commission of \r\nInquiry to conduct a comprehensive special inquiry \r\ninto the events in Aleppo in order to identify all those \r\nfor whom there are reasonable grounds to suspect \r\nresponsibility for alleged violations and abuses of \r\ninternational human rights law and to support efforts to \r\nensure that perpetrators are held accountable.\r\nThe Council also considered the updates and \r\nreports of the Commission of Inquiry on Human \r\nRights in Eritrea and the report of the United Nations \r\nIndependent Investigation on Burundi, established last \r\nDecember pursuant to Human Rights Council resolution \r\nS-24/1, when the Council requested that the High \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 3/29\r\nCommissioner for Human Rights dispatch a mission \r\nof independent experts to Burundi to investigate \r\nviolations and abuses of human rights committed since \r\nApril 2015. Following the report of the Independent \r\nInvestigation in September, the Council decided to \r\nestablish a Commission of Inquiry on the human rights \r\nsituation in Burundi, with a mandate to conduct a \r\nthorough investigation into human rights violations and \r\nabuses since April 2015.\r\nWhile recalling the findings and recommendations \r\nof the Commission of Inquiry on Human rights in the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, the Human \r\nRights Council requested that the High Commissioner \r\ndesignate two independent experts to support of the \r\nwork of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea. The group of independent experts is mandated \r\nto focus on issues of accountability for human rights \r\nviolations, in particular where such violations amount \r\nto crimes against humanity. The experts will present \r\ntheir report to the Council next March.\r\nIn the past year, the Council also established the \r\nCommission on Human Rights in South Sudan through \r\nresolution 31/20, of 23 March 2016. The Commission \r\nis mandated to monitor and report on the situation of \r\nhuman rights in the country and make recommendations \r\nfor its improvement. The Commission will also present \r\nits report to the Council next March and will share the \r\nreport with the General Assembly.\r\nIn 2016, the Council extended the existing country-\r\nspecific special procedures mandates for Belarus, \r\nthe Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, Eritrea, the \r\nIslamic Republic of Iran, Mali, Myanmar, Somalia and \r\nthe Sudan.\r\nIn addition to responding to urgent situations and \r\ncrises around the world, the Human Rights Council \r\nalso addressed a number of global issues throughout the \r\nyear. In particular, during this year’s high-level panel \r\ndiscussion on promoting the mainstreaming of human \r\nrights throughout the United Nations system, the \r\nCouncil explored new opportunities arising from the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to advance \r\nhuman rights and discussed how the 2030 Agenda \r\ncould help bring the three pillars of the United Nations \r\ncloser together.\r\nIn efforts to leave no one behind, the Human Rights \r\nCouncil engaged in a wide range of thematic debates \r\nand held 20 panel discussions on important issues, such \r\nas the state of racial discrimination worldwide, human \r\nrights and climate change, the rights of persons with \r\ndisabilities, the rights of the child, the human rights of \r\nwomen, using sport and the Olympic ideal to promote \r\nhuman rights for all, the human rights dimensions of \r\npreventing and countering violent extremism and the \r\ncontribution of parliaments to the work of the Council \r\nand its Universal Periodic Review (UPR).\r\nThe special procedures of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil played a central role in responding to human \r\nrights challenges throughout the year, acting as the \r\nCouncil’s ears and eyes and shining a light into the \r\ndarkest corners of the world. The reports of the special \r\nprocedures mandate-holders constitute one of the \r\nmain sources of reliable information on human rights \r\nsituations around the world and provide a solid basis for \r\nthe dialogues and debates in the Council.\r\nIn 2016, the Council established two new special \r\nprocedures mandates: an independent expert on \r\nprotection against violence and discrimination based \r\non sexual orientation and gender identity; and a special \r\nrapporteur on the right to development. The Council \r\nalso decided to modify the mandate of the Expert \r\nMechanism on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and \r\nincreased the number of members to seven, to represent \r\neach of the seven indigenous sociocultural regions. \r\nI hope that the creation and enhancement of these \r\nmandates will result in further strengthening the work \r\nof the Council in promoting and protecting human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms for all.\r\nAllow me now to turn to the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, which is taking place in Geneva as we speak. \r\nWe are quickly approaching the end of the second cycle \r\nof the UPR, and the third cycle is set to commence \r\nnext May. The process continues to receive positive \r\nfeedback from all stakeholders, and I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to highlight some of the positive trends \r\nand some of the challenges being faced.\r\nThe principle of the universality of the UPR \r\ncontinues to be preserved, with the participation of all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations. In the majority \r\nof cases, delegations continue to be represented at \r\nthe ministerial level. However, the participation and \r\ninvolvement of small countries and States that do not \r\nhave representation in Geneva is a challenge to the \r\nprinciple of universality. In that regard, the increased \r\nattention given to the needs of those States through a \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n4/29 16-36139\r\nvariety of programmes and activities have helped to \r\nkeep them engaged in the process.\r\nAnother important principle in the UPR process is its \r\nperiodicity. The focus by States on the implementation \r\nof recommendations received in previous review cycles \r\nwhen drafting their national reports and presenting \r\nthem in the working group is most welcome and duly \r\nreflects the cyclical nature of the reviews. Going \r\nforward into the third cycle, the focus on follow-up and \r\nimplementation will need to be strengthened in order \r\nto safeguard the effectiveness and credibility of the \r\nfollow-up mechanism.\r\nStates are increasingly strengthening their \r\nnational processes and systems in order to ensure \r\nmore systematic engagement with, and follow-up \r\non, the recommendations of the Universal Periodic \r\nReview, along with other human rights mechanisms. \r\nThat approach is highly encouraged and should be \r\nfurther pursued.\r\nProtecting the role of civil society and national \r\nhuman rights institutions in our work is an issue \r\nof great importance. The active participation and \r\ncontributions of civil society are central to the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms, \r\nmaking the Council unique among United Nations \r\nintergovernmental bodies. In the course of this year, \r\nI have been apprised and seized of alleged cases of \r\nintimidation, threats and reprisals against individuals \r\nwho cooperate or have cooperated with the Human \r\nRights Council and its mechanisms. I have repeatedly \r\nappealed to the Council to ensure the safe participation \r\nof civil society in our work and, when necessary, I \r\nhave followed up directly with the States concerned. \r\nI would like once again to reiterate that, without the \r\ncontribution of civil society, the Council and its \r\nmechanisms would lack the substantive information and \r\nsupport needed to effectively perform their mandates. \r\nIt is essential that representatives of civil society be \r\nafforded adequate protection to operate in a free, open \r\nand safe environment that protects and promotes their \r\nown human rights.\r\nLet me now turn to the issues that directly touch \r\nupon the Assembly’s work. This year, the Human \r\nRights Council adopted a number of resolutions with \r\nrecommendations made to the General Assembly. \r\nThrough resolution 31/17, on the human rights situation \r\nin Syria, adopted in March, the Human Rights Council \r\nrecommended that the General Assembly submit the \r\nreports of the Independent International Commission of \r\nInquiry on the Syrian Arabic Republic to the Security \r\nCouncil for appropriate action. And in June, the Human \r\nRights Council requested that the General Assembly \r\nsubmit the report and oral updates of the Commission \r\nof Inquiry on human rights in Eritrea to all the relevant \r\norgans of the United Nations for consideration and \r\nappropriate action.\r\nThe Council also recommended that the General \r\nAssembly remain apprised of the matter of ensuring \r\naccountability and justice for all violations of \r\ninternational law in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding East Jerusalem. The General Assembly is \r\nadvised to remain seized of the matter until it is satisfied \r\nthat appropriate action with regard to implementing \r\nthe recommendations made in the report of the United \r\nNations Fact-Finding Mission on the Gaza Conflict has \r\nbeen or is being taken at the national or international \r\nlevel to ensure justice for victims and accountability \r\nfor perpetrators. Finally, in resolution 32/28, adopted \r\nin June, the Council recommended that the General \r\nAssembly adopt the Declaration on the Right to Peace.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to briefly touch upon \r\nthe significant challenges being faced by the Human \r\nRights Council in terms of the resources required for \r\nit to continue its activities. As I mentioned earlier, \r\nthe Council continues to adopt numerous resolutions \r\nand decisions, which carry significant resource \r\nimplications. While the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Human Rights is asked to \r\ncomply with an increasing number of mandates arising \r\nfrom Human Rights Council decisions, its regular \r\nbudget has not kept pace with that growth.\r\nI would also like to refer to a crucial additional \r\nchallenge, that is, the Human Rights Council is now \r\nfaced with the real possibility of having its meeting time \r\nreduced and capped. From 2018 onwards, the Council \r\nmay have to reduce its meeting time by as many as 23 \r\nmeetings per year in order to comply with the limitations \r\nbeing discussed. These restrictions would greatly affect \r\nthe work of the Human Rights Council, particularly its \r\nmost distinctive characteristic — its responsiveness \r\nin addressing human rights issues worldwide in an \r\nefficient and timely manner. Although I am fully aware \r\nof the current financial challenges being faced, I seek \r\nthe cooperation and support of all Member States in \r\naddressing this issue through the Fifth Committee. \r\nIn that regard, it is my intention to propose to the \r\nCouncil, at its organizational session on 5 December, \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 5/29\r\nthat it adopt a draft decision requesting the support of \r\nthe General Assembly for the organization of its 2017 \r\nsessions, which may amount to 150 meetings.\r\nDespite the tireless efforts of the Council, and of \r\nthe United Nations as a whole, to effectively respond \r\nto the multiple crises that we have faced in 2016, \r\nthe human rights situation worldwide has shown \r\nlittle improvement since the beginning of the year. \r\nHuman rights violations and abuses are still rampant, \r\nhumanitarian conditions are worsening and armed \r\nconflicts continue to rage. But we cannot lose hope or \r\noptimism — these two words are our guiding lights \r\nwith which we illuminate the darkest corners of the \r\nworld. And we must make additional concerted efforts \r\nthroughout the United Nations system if we are to bring \r\nabout positive changes in the world. I am certain that \r\ntogether we can effect gradual change.\r\nI wish to take this opportunity to thank the General \r\nAssembly for its support for the Human Rights Council \r\nand the Council’s work over the past 10 years. The \r\nHuman Rights Council will continue to faithfully \r\ndischarge its responsibilities as a subsidiary body of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and as the United Nations premier \r\nforum on human rights.\r\nFinally, on behalf of the Human Rights Council, \r\nI hope that the General Assembly will continue to \r\nprovide its full and effective support to the Council \r\nthrough the remainder of the tenth cycle, and I would \r\nlike to welcome all members to the Human Rights \r\nCouncil next year.\r\nThe President: I thank President Choi Kyonglim \r\nfor introducing the report of the Human Rights Council.\r\nI now give the f loor to the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMs. Cardona (European Union): I have the honour \r\nto speak on behalf of the European Union (EU). The \r\ncandidate countries the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Montenegro, Serbia and Albania; and the \r\ncountry of the Stabilization and Association Process \r\nand potential candidate Bosnia and Herzegovina align \r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union would like to thank the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council, Ambassador \r\nChoi Kyonglim, for presenting the Council’s eleventh \r\nannual report (A/71/53) to the General Assembly.\r\nThe European Union has been a strong supporter \r\nof the Human Rights Council since its establishment. \r\nAs this year marks the Council’s tenth anniversary, \r\nwe would like to take this opportunity to reaffirm \r\nour continued support and our engagement to make \r\nfurther progress. Being the only United Nations body \r\nmandated to support the promotion and protection of \r\nall human rights around the globe, the Council has \r\nstrengthened the ability of the United Nations to help \r\nensure that all persons enjoy their human rights and \r\nthat violations thereof are disclosed. We attach great \r\nimportance to both the credibility and the effectiveness \r\nof the Council.\r\nThe European Union will continue to make every \r\neffort to ensure that the Human Rights Council is not \r\nonly able to address violations and abuses of human \r\nrights, including gross and systematic violations and \r\nabuses, and to respond promptly to human rights \r\nemergencies, but also to improve human rights \r\nstandards and their implementation worldwide through \r\nsystematic work on relevant thematic issues. In that \r\ncontext, the European Union recalls the importance of \r\nthe Council’s independence and strongly opposes any \r\nattempts to undermine the institutional position of the \r\nCouncil within the United Nations system.\r\nThe European Union welcomes the central role \r\nplayed by the Human Rights Council in addressing \r\nhuman rights situations throughout the world. The \r\nsevere consequences of the crisis in Syria and the \r\nviolations committed by all parties, particularly the \r\nSyrian regime and its allies, cannot be ignored by any \r\nState. Any breaches of international law, in particular \r\nof international humanitarian law and human rights \r\nlaw, some of which may constitute war crimes or \r\ncrimes against humanity, must be brought to justice. \r\nIn that context, the Council’s ongoing response to the \r\ncrisis remains critically important, as mirrored by its \r\nefforts to foster accountability and to fight against \r\nimpunity. We would also like to stress the importance \r\nof the promotion and protection of human rights as the \r\nkey to conflict prevention.\r\nThe Council has demonstrated its commitment to \r\nproviding technical assistance and capacity-building to \r\nthe Governments of Côte d’Ivoire, Libya and Mali to \r\npromote human rights, and we welcome the continued \r\nsupport that has been rendered to the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, as well \r\nas the Republic of Guinea, South Sudan and Ukraine. \r\nWe trust that the Council will continue to closely \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n6/29 16-36139\r\nmonitor situations where technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building can make a difference and that it will \r\ntake action where necessary.\r\nOn 28 October, the General Assembly elected 14 \r\nnew members of the Council. Serving as a Council \r\nmember entails important responsibilities. Paragraph \r\n9 of General Assembly resolution 60/251 provides that\r\n“members elected to the Council shall uphold the \r\nhighest standards in the promotion and protection \r\nof human rights” .\r\nWhile we congratulate the new members, we also \r\nencourage everyone to pay careful attention to the \r\nhuman rights records and commitments of States \r\nthroughout their membership.\r\nWe attach great importance to all aspects of the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s work, from the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review to the special procedures that are \r\nmandated by the Council’s resolutions. It is with that \r\nin mind that we must voice our strong concerns at the \r\ndraft resolution that has been submitted in the Third \r\nCommittee on the report of the Human Rights Council. \r\nThat draft resolution seeks to subvert a legitimate \r\ndecision of the Human Rights Council by deferring \r\none particular resolution, namely, Council resolution \r\n32/2, of 30 June 2016, on protection against violence \r\nand discrimination based on sexual orientation and \r\ngender identity. In our view, any attempt to call into \r\nquestion the legitimacy of that resolution has no legal \r\nfoundation. The text was adopted in Geneva in June, \r\nand, on that basis, Mr. Vitit Muntarbhorn was appointed \r\nat the thirty-third session of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in September as the new independent expert. \r\nAll 47 members of the Council went along with that \r\nappointment. Other current mandate-holders have been \r\nappointed on the basis of voted resolutions. To question \r\nthat mandate is to question the delicate institutional \r\nrelationship between the Human Rights Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly and their respective competences. \r\nThe creation of a special procedure is well within the \r\npurview of the Human Rights Council and should not \r\nbe questioned or reopened by the General Assembly. \r\nOtherwise, the functioning of the Council and the \r\nwork of the Member States in the Council would be \r\nseriously called into question. Moreover, there should \r\nbe no misunderstanding about the function of the new \r\nindependent expert and how it relates to the need for \r\nStates to protect the human rights of all individuals \r\nwithout distinction of any kind. No one should have to \r\nsuffer violence or discrimination on the basis of who \r\nthey are.\r\nWe strongly encourage all States and stakeholders \r\nto cooperate with the special procedures as a means \r\nto enhance the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights, and we reaffirm notably that States elected \r\nto membership of the Council are required to fully \r\ncooperate with it.\r\nThe EU welcomes the continued cooperation of \r\nthe Government of Myanmar in granting access to the \r\nUnited Nations Special Rapporteur. That is a positive \r\nexample and one which we trust will be followed by other \r\ncountries. We hope that the Government of Myanmar \r\nwill also see the full benefit of opening an office of \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights (OHCHR), with a full mandate, in \r\nthe light of the positive experience in countries across \r\nother regions. We also welcome the extensions of the \r\ncountry-specific mandates of the Special Rapporteurs \r\non the situation of human rights in Iran, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea and Belarus, and the \r\nextension of the mandates of the independent experts \r\non the situation of human rights in Haiti, the Sudan, the \r\nCentral African Republic and Mali.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of a Commission for \r\nHuman Rights in South Sudan, and we take note of the \r\nfinal report of the Commission of Inquiry on Human \r\nRights in Eritrea. We hope that the General Assembly \r\nand other relevant United Nations organs will give it \r\ndue attention. In the light of the ongoing human rights \r\nviolations and abuses, we welcome the consensual \r\nadoption of the resolution on Yemen and look forward \r\nto the High Commissioner’s update on its findings at \r\nthe next Council session, in March 2017. Similarly, we \r\nwelcome the resolution addressing the human rights \r\nconcerns in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\r\nThe European Union would also like to highlight \r\nthe importance of the resolution on the human rights \r\nsituation in Burundi, which, in response to the latest \r\nreport of a group of independent experts, establishes \r\na commission of inquiry into alleged grave human \r\nrights violations committed in the country. We look to \r\nBurundi, as a member of the Council, to fully cooperate \r\nwith that commission once it is established, as well as \r\nwith other international human rights mechanisms. \r\nMembers of the Human Rights Council should uphold \r\nthe highest standards in the promotion and protection \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 7/29\r\nof human rights, and we reiterate our urgent call to the \r\nGovernment of Burundi to do so.\r\nThe European Union attaches great importance \r\nto the valuable contributions made by civil society \r\nto the work of the Council and is gravely concerned \r\nregarding attacks and threats against, and harassment \r\nand intimidation of, participants from civil society and \r\nother stakeholders.\r\nThe European Union remains strongly committed to \r\nthe Universal Periodic Review (UPR), a truly universal \r\nand unique mechanism within the United Nations that \r\naddresses all human rights and is applicable to all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations without distinction or \r\ndiscrimination. As we are soon approaching the third \r\ncycle of the UPR, we encourage States to further \r\nstrengthen the focus on implementation of previously \r\naccepted recommendations. We acknowledge the \r\nimportance of providing technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building with a view to the implementation of \r\nUPR recommendations, and we are immensely grateful \r\nfor the valuable support provided by OHCHR in that \r\nregard. Finally, we welcome the important contributions \r\nmade by civil society in the UPR process.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate our ongoing \r\ncommitment to contributing to the work of the Human \r\nRights Council and to further strengthening its role \r\nin the protection and development of international \r\nhuman rights law and in the prevention of human \r\nrights violations and abuses. We will continue to \r\nsystematically uphold and ensure implementation of \r\nexisting international norms and standards, to strongly \r\nadvocate for the universality of human rights and to \r\npromote the observance by all States of all human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms.\r\nMr. Ntwaagae (Botswana): I have the honour \r\nto deliver this statement on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States.\r\nThe Group adds its congratulatory voice in \r\nconnection with the newly elected and re-elected \r\nmembers of the Human Rights Council. The Group of \r\nAfrican States welcomes the President of the Human \r\nRights Council, Mr. Choi Kyonglim, and wishes to \r\nexpress its appreciation for the opportunity to dialogue \r\nwith him on the activities of the Council over the \r\npast year. The Group commends the President for his \r\nleadership and commitment and for his professionalism \r\nand constructiveness in the conduct of the work of the \r\nCouncil. It assures him of its continuous support and \r\ncooperation in the discharge of his duties.\r\nThe Group of African States wishes to reaffirm \r\nthe Council’s mandate, as set out in resolution 60/251, \r\nof promoting universal respect for, the protection of, \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, \r\nwithout distinction of any kind and in a fair and equal \r\nmanner and make recommendations thereon. On that \r\nbasis, the Group has been consistently supportive of the \r\nwork of the Council.\r\nThe Group of African States views the principles \r\non which the Council’s mandate rests as extremely \r\nimportant, particularly the principle of cooperation and \r\ngenuine dialogue, which is aimed at strengthening the \r\ncapacity of Member States to comply with their human \r\nrights obligations. It is therefore incumbent upon the \r\nCouncil in discharging its mandate to firmly apply the \r\nprinciples of universality, objectivity and non-selectivity \r\nin the consideration of human rights issues.\r\nThe Group of African States is convinced that the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review remains the most effective \r\nmechanism of universal application to assist States in \r\nfulfilling their human rights obligations. In our view, the \r\nmechanism remains relevant and key to the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights. The Group would like \r\nto reaffirm the need to preserve the cooperative nature \r\nand principle of dialogue of the mechanism. The Group \r\nfirmly believes that it is critical that the United Nations \r\nVoluntary Fund for Financial and Technical Assistance \r\nfor the Implementation of the Univeral Periodic Review \r\nbe provided with adequate resources to assist States \r\nto develop national capacity and expertise for the \r\nimplementation of the agreed recommendations.\r\nWhile the Group of African States reiterates its \r\nsupport for the mechanisms and special procedures \r\nof the Council and the important work they undertake \r\nin the promotion and protection of human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms, the Group believes that there \r\nis a need for rationalization of these mechanisms and \r\nspecial procedures in order for them to be effective. \r\nThe Group would like to emphasize also the need for \r\nthe procedures to comply with the institution-building \r\npackage, the code of conduct of mandate-holders \r\nand their respective mandates. In that regard, we \r\nwould like to express our support for the item on the \r\nCouncil’s agenda that relates to technical cooperation \r\nand capacity-building in the field of human rights. We \r\ntake this opportunity to stress that this agenda item \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n8/29 16-36139\r\nshould not be used to serve other objectives, such as \r\nmonitoring and investigation. Advisory services on \r\nhuman rights issues should be provided only when the \r\nState concerned so requests, based on its priorities and \r\nnational ownership, with full respect for its sovereignty \r\nand political independence.\r\nThe annual report (A/71/53) before the Assembly \r\nsets out in a comprehensive manner the resolutions \r\nthat were adopted by the Council during its yearly \r\ndeliberations. The Group of African States is cognizant \r\nof the provisions of General Assembly resolution \r\n60/251, specifically of paragraph 5 (i), which provides \r\nfor recommendations to be made by the Council \r\nto the Third Committee of the General Assembly; \r\nhence its support for the universal membership of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Group of African States strongly deplores \r\nall forms of stereotyping, exclusion, stigmatization, \r\nprejudice, intolerance, discrimination, hate speech \r\nand violence directed against peoples, communities \r\nand individuals on any grounds whatsoever, wherever \r\nand whenever they occur. It is greatly perturbed by \r\nthe attempts to introduce and impose new notions \r\nand concepts that are not internationally agreed upon, \r\nparticularly in areas where no legal foundation exists in \r\nany international human rights instrument. We are even \r\nmore disturbed at the attempt to focus on individuals on \r\nthe basis of their sexual preference and behaviour, while \r\nignoring that intolerance and discrimination regrettably \r\nexist in various parts of the world, be it on the basis of \r\ncolour, race, sex or religion, to mention only a few. By \r\ncreating divisions, those attempts not only undermine \r\nthe intent of the drafters and signatories of the various \r\nhuman rights instruments, but also seriously jeopardize \r\nthe entire international human rights framework. We \r\ncall upon all Member States to refrain from attempting \r\nto give priority to the rights of certain individuals, as this \r\ncould result in negative discrimination at the expense of \r\nother internationally agreed rights and thereby conflict \r\nwith the principles of non-discrimination and equality. \r\nThose principles are well entrenched in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and other internationally agreed \r\nhuman rights instruments, which all reaffirm our faith \r\nin fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth \r\nof the human person and in the equal rights of men and \r\nwomen, without distinction.\r\nThe adoption in June of resolution 32/2, entitled \r\n“Protection against violence and discrimination based \r\non sexual orientation and gender identity”, is a clear \r\nillustration of such attempts. The Group is concerned \r\nbecause notions that have not received international \r\nacceptance, such as sexual orientation and gender \r\nidentity, are being given attention to the detriment of \r\nissues of paramount importance, such as the right to \r\ndevelopment and the racism agenda. We are alarmed \r\nbecause the Council is delving into matters that fall \r\nessentially within the domestic jurisdiction of States. \r\nThat runs counter to the commitment in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations to respecting the sovereignty of \r\nStates and the principle of non-intervention. Of even \r\ngreater significance is the ominous reference to two \r\nnotions: sexual orientation and gender identity. We \r\nwish to state that those two notions are not and should \r\nnot be linked to existing international human rights \r\ninstruments. In that regard, the Group of African States \r\nhas submitted a draft resolution calling for the deferral \r\nof the consideration of, and action on, Human Rights \r\nCouncil resolution 32/2, of 30 June 2016, in order to \r\nallow time for further discussions and consultations on \r\nthe legality of the creation of this mandate, which my \r\ncolleague from the European Union just made reference \r\nto. We therefore call for the suspension of the activities \r\nof the appointed independent expert pending a final \r\ndetermination on the issue.\r\nWe urge all States and the relevant international \r\nhuman rights mechanisms to intensify their efforts to \r\nconsolidate the international community’s commitment \r\nto the promotion and protection of the human rights of \r\neveryone on an equal footing, without exception, and \r\nwe call upon all Member States to continue to step \r\nup their efforts to achieve the total elimination of all \r\nforms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and \r\nrelated intolerance.\r\nIn conclusion, the Group of African States wishes \r\nto reassure you, Mr. President, of our full support \r\nand cooperation and to reaffirm its commitment to \r\nthe fundamental principle of human rights for all, as \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): I have the honour \r\nto deliver this statement on behalf of Iceland and my \r\nown country, Liechtenstein.\r\nWe thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for presenting the Council’s report (A/71/53) \r\nto the General Assembly, an established practice that \r\nreinforces the dynamic relationship between the Council \r\nand the Assembly. The Council can look back on a busy, \r\nsuccessful and historic year — its tenth anniversary. \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 9/29\r\nWe commend President Choi Kyonglim for his able \r\nleadership. What started out in 2006 as a project \r\nthat met with opposition from various quarters has \r\nnow become one of the international community’s \r\nmost important instruments for promoting universal \r\nrespect for human rights and addressing situations of \r\ngross and systematic human rights violations. In its \r\n10-year history, the Council has adopted landmark \r\nresolutions and appointed special mandate-holders on \r\nimportant issues such as violence against women, the \r\nprotection of human rights defenders and the right to \r\nprivacy. It has also established several country-specific \r\nmechanisms, and in particular commissions of inquiry \r\nin Syria, Eritrea, South Sudan, Libya, Gaza, North \r\nKorea and Burundi.\r\nMany of those achievements reflect the original \r\nideas behind the Council, that is, promoting universal \r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nwithout distinction of any kind, guided by the principles \r\nof universality, impartiality, objectivity, non-selectivity \r\nand constructive dialogue and cooperation; but also \r\naddressing specifically those situations where human \r\nrights are systematically violated. Unfortunately, \r\nthe Council has become more and more polarized in \r\nrecent years. The opposition to certain country-specific \r\nissues as well as thematic issues has become a matter \r\nof politics, and the actual human rights consequences \r\nfor thousands — sometimes millions — of people have \r\ntaken a back seat. That polarization has even encroached \r\nup on issues on which members had previously been \r\nunited, leading to regression on previously agreed \r\ncommitments and standards. There also seems to be \r\na trend towards reduced engagement in the Human \r\nRights Council — resolutions are often not subject to \r\nactual negotiations, and there are no genuine efforts to \r\nnarrow differences and to increase political support. \r\nWe hope that this is a trend that will soon be reversed.\r\nThe establishment of the Human Rights Council \r\nwas based on the understanding that those who served \r\non it would commit themselves to cooperation and to the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. In order to \r\nallow for informed decisions in the elections, candidate \r\ncountries are asked to submit voluntary pledges and \r\ncommitments. The practice today is that, although a vast \r\nmajority of States running for election to the Council \r\nmake such submissions, these are barely a factor in our \r\ndecision-making, and often amount to little more than \r\na somewhat interesting read. We of course need to look \r\nat our own behaviour as the electorate. We can choose \r\nto ask for genuine commitments and implementation; \r\nyet our decision-making today is largely based on \r\nconsiderations that have little to do with the strong \r\nperformance of the Council. We believe that overall \r\npolitical commitments, such as support for the code \r\nof conduct regarding Security Council action against \r\ngenocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes, \r\nas elaborated by the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency Group, should play an important part in \r\nour decision-making in Council elections.\r\nLet me offer a few comments on issues covered in \r\nthe latest report. We are concerned by the insufficient \r\naction of the Council on the situation in Yemen. The \r\nCouncil adopted a resolution on technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building in the field of human rights — hardly \r\na reflection of the actual needs on the ground. Given \r\nthe reports of massive and frequent violations of \r\ninternational humanitarian law, the situation in Yemen \r\ndeserves nothing short of a commission of inquiry to \r\ncollect evidence of human rights abuses and violations.\r\nThe Council has been seized of the situation in Syria \r\nfor several years now. Its most important decision was \r\nundoubtedly the creation of a commission of inquiry, \r\nwhich has supplied ample evidence and documentation \r\nof war crimes and crimes against humanity committed \r\nby the conflict parties. The Council also met recently in \r\nspecial session to address the situation in Aleppo, which \r\nwas of particular importance after the veto cast in the \r\nSecurity Council on 8 October (see S/PV.7785). While \r\nthe efforts of the Commission in particular continue to \r\nbe highly relevant, it is also obvious that the activities of \r\nthe international community are inadequate, especially \r\nin the area of accountability, where we have failed the \r\nvictims of the conflict in Syria for over five years now. \r\nWe believe that the time has come for the Assembly to \r\nstep up and play its own role in that respect.\r\nIn the reporting period, the Council created several \r\nnew mandates for special procedures and renewed \r\nothers. We call on all countries to cooperate with the \r\nspecial procedures, including by issuing standing \r\ninvitations, and to enable them to conduct their work \r\nindependently and without interference. Their valuable \r\nwork supports us in moving towards the achievement \r\nof commitments we have made: in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, in the Universal Declaration of Human \r\nRights in conventions and in recent agreements such \r\nas the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nWe commend the Council, in particular for its recent \r\nestablishment of a mandate for an independent expert \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n10/29 16-36139\r\non protection against violence and discrimination \r\nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity, and we \r\ncongratulate Mr. Muntarbhorn on his appointment as \r\nthe independent expert. Ever since the first resolution \r\non that issue was put forward by South Africa and \r\nBrazil in 2011, this issue has been high on the Council’s \r\nagenda. The setting up of a special mandate is a \r\nreflection of the issue’s importance, further underlined \r\nby the many heinous crimes committed against lesbian, \r\ngay, bisexual, transgender and intersex persons around \r\nthe globe.\r\nMr. Bhattarai (Nepal), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nWe would like to highlight that, in conformity with \r\nthe outcome of General Assembly resolution 65/281, \r\nentitled “Review of the Human Rights Council”, it is \r\nup to the plenary of the Assembly — and not its Third \r\nCommittee — to take action on the report of the Council. \r\nThe review includes the understanding that the Third \r\nCommittee is to consider and act on recommendations of \r\nthe Council to the Assembly. We call on all delegations \r\nto respect the agreed understanding in the review and \r\nnot to undo the valuable work carried out by the Human \r\nRights Council.\r\nMs. Wilson (Australia): Australia supported the \r\nestablishment of the Human Rights Council in 2006 \r\nand, 10 years on, we remain convinced that the Council \r\nand its mechanisms continue to play a fundamental role \r\nin upholding universal human rights. Today we have \r\nan opportunity to consider the Council’s achievements \r\nover the past year, of which there have been many, and I \r\ntake this opportunity to briefly highlight a couple.\r\nWe are pleased to note that the Council adopted \r\nits first resolution on violence against women, with a \r\nstrong focus on indigenous women. We welcome the \r\nCouncil’s increased focus on improving the human \r\nrights outcomes for indigenous peoples generally, \r\nincluding by strengthening the Expert Mechanism \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. Australia was \r\nalso pleased to sponsor the resolution on national \r\ninstitutions for the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights at the Council’s September session, which was \r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nLast but not least, like other delegations here, we wish \r\nto express our strong support for the Council’s resolution \r\non protection against violence and discrimination on \r\nthe basis of sexual orientation and gender identity, \r\nincluding the appointment of an independent expert \r\non protection against violence and discrimination \r\nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity. That \r\nrepresents a significant step towards recognizing the \r\nneed to protect the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender \r\nand intersex (LGBTI) community from discrimination \r\nand violence. I would stress that it is not an attempt to \r\nelevate that issue over other human rights issues, but \r\nsimply to ensure similar recognition of the importance \r\nof LGBTI discrimination and violence as one of several \r\nserious international human rights issues.\r\nIn that regard, we continue to be extremely \r\ndisappointed to hear that some States, including some \r\ngathered here today, are challenging the appointment of \r\nthe independent expert by the Human Rights Council. \r\nWe would like to reiterate our position that it is up to the \r\nplenary General Assembly, not the Third Committee, \r\nto consider the report (A/71/53) of the Council in \r\naccordance with Assembly resolution 65/281, and we \r\ntake this opportunity to reaffirm our support for the \r\nindependence and mandate of the Council. We call \r\non countries to support the appointment of the expert \r\nand to work cooperatively with him as he exercises \r\nhis mandate. Australia has a long history of engaging \r\ncooperatively with human rights mechanisms and \r\nprocesses, including through our standing invitation \r\nto special procedure mandate-holders, and we look \r\nforward to welcoming a number of special rapporteurs \r\nover coming months.\r\nAustralia will continue to be a champion for the \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. For the first \r\ntime, we have put forward our candidature for the Human \r\nRights Council, for the period 2018-2020. We believe \r\nthat all States should have an equal voice in the Council, \r\nregardless of size. We have been a strong supporter of \r\nthe active participation of small island States and least \r\ndeveloped countries in the Council, just as we are here \r\nin New York and in the United Nations system more \r\nbroadly. We were pleased to support the participation \r\nof small island developing States and least developed \r\ncountries in the proceedings of the tenth anniversary \r\nsession of the Human Rights Council in Geneva — the \r\nfirst Council session with universal participation. Given \r\nthe opportunity to serve on the Council, Australia \r\nwould focus on five key areas: advancing the rights \r\nof women and girls; promoting good governance and \r\nstrong democratic institutions everywhere; protecting \r\nthe freedom of expression; advancing the rights of \r\nindigenous peoples; and promoting strong national \r\nhuman rights institutions. Regardless of whether or not \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 11/29\r\nAustralia is on the Council, we will remain strongly \r\ncommitted to engaging actively and constructively \r\nto improve the human rights situation for all people \r\naround the world.\r\nMr. Sukhee (Mongolia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto express our thanks to His Excellency Ambassador \r\nChoi Kyonglim, President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, for his leadership and his presentation of the \r\nCouncil’s report (A/71/53) to the General Assembly \r\ntoday. This year, the Council has been able to address \r\npressing human rights issues and adopt a number \r\nof resolutions and decisions. In that connection, it \r\nshould be emphasized that the tenth anniversary of the \r\nestablishment of the Council, which was celebrated \r\nearlier this year, was an opportunity for us to reflect \r\non the Council’s achievements and challenges, evaluate \r\nlessons learned, prescribe necessary changes and look \r\nforward to a stronger and more effective Council in \r\nthe future.\r\nIn 2016, it has been a great honour for Mongolia \r\nto serve the first year of its membership of the Human \r\nRights Council. We believe that the Human Rights \r\nCouncil should be a platform for enhanced and open \r\ndiscussion on human rights issues with a positive \r\nimpact on national policies. As a newly elected member, \r\nMonglia is focusing on a number of priorities, such \r\nas ensuring gender equality, protecting the rights of \r\nwomen, children and persons with disabilities, fighting \r\nhuman trafficking in all its forms, combating racial and \r\ngender discrimination, abolishing the death penalty, \r\npromoting the freedom of opinion and expression, and \r\npromoting the freedom of assembly and association.\r\n The promotion and protection of human rights, \r\nfundamental freedoms, justice and equality have been \r\nat the core of all policies pursued by the Government \r\nof Mongolia. Accordingly, Mongolia has been \r\nconstructively engaged with the Working Group \r\non the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), and our \r\nsecond national report was reviewed in 2015 under \r\nthe UPR review process. In order to implement the \r\nrecommendations of the second UPR, the Government \r\nof Mongolia adopted its national action plan, which was \r\ndeveloped through consultative processes engaging \r\nall relevant stakeholders. As the Council approaches \r\nthe third cycle of the UPR, more focus should be \r\ngiven to ensuring the effective implementation of the \r\nrecommendations made during previous cycles. In \r\nthat regard, constructive engagement, cooperation and \r\ntechnical support are of the utmost importance.\r\nWe take this opportunity to commend the \r\ninitiative and work of the President of the Council in \r\nmoving forward the discussion with Member States on \r\nimproving the working methods of the Council with a \r\nview to enhancing the efficiency of its work.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate my \r\nGovernment’s commitment to contributing to Human \r\nRights Council activities during its membership \r\nthrough voluntary pledges and commitments made in \r\naccordance with General Assembly resolution 60/251.\r\nMs. Mendelson (United States of America): \r\nThe Human Rights Council is a critically important \r\ninstitution; it ensures that human rights remain a focus \r\nof our work at the United Nations.\r\nIn recent days, we have grown concerned at the \r\nmanner in which some Member States have dealt with \r\nthe report (A/71/53) of the Human Rights Council. The \r\nUnited States strongly supports Human Rights Council \r\nresolution 32/2, which established a mandate for an \r\nindependent expert on protection against violence and \r\ndiscrimination based on sexual orientation and gender \r\nidentity. Although sexual orientation and gender \r\nidentity are sensitive issues for some countries, no \r\none should face violence or discrimination because \r\nof their sexual orientation or gender identity, and \r\nthese issues clearly belong on the agenda of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. The Human Rights Council \r\nhas adopted numerous resolutions on persons who \r\nexperience violence and discrimination as a result \r\nof specific characteristics or circumstances, such as \r\nbelonging to a minority group. The sexual orientation \r\nand gender identity mandate falls perfectly in line with \r\nthese existing mandates and addresses the specific \r\nissues around violence and discrimination experienced \r\nby persons on the basis of their sexual orientation \r\nor gender identity. We also strongly support the \r\nappointment of Mr. Vitit Muntarbhorn, a distinguished \r\ninternational law professor who has served on a number \r\nof bodies of the United Nations. He was appointed to \r\nthis position on 30 September and has already begun \r\nhis important work.\r\nYesterday, the African Group submitted its annual \r\ndraft resolution on the Human Rights Council report. \r\nWhile this is typically procedural in nature, this \r\nyear’s draft resolution includes incredibly problematic \r\nlanguage. It attempts to delay the consideration of the \r\nHuman Rights Council resolution, spuriously objecting \r\nto the legal basis for the independent expert’s mandate. \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n12/29 16-36139\r\nWe are deeply concerned about this attempt. Seeking \r\nto reopen a Human Rights Council mandate that some \r\nStates deem objectionable, and to do so under the guise \r\nof a legal concern, is inconsistent with respect for \r\nthe Human Rights Council’s ability to function. Such \r\nan attempt has never been made before. The General \r\nAssembly has never attempted to reopen a Human \r\nRights Council mandate where a mandate-holder has \r\nbeen appointed and is fully functioning. This would set a \r\nvery dangerous precedent. The Council has established \r\nmany mandates that various countries oppose, but no \r\ncountry has sought to relitigate those mandates in the \r\nThird Committee.\r\nWe also must remember that civil society \r\norganizations and Governments work courageously in \r\nall regions to protect the human rights of all persons, \r\nregardless of their sexual orientation or gender identity. \r\nOur actions on the Africa Group’s draft resolution in the \r\nThird Committee and in the plenary of the Assembly \r\nwill have significant implications for their work. We \r\nmust continue to uphold dignity and fundamental \r\nfreedoms for all persons.\r\nMembers of the Latin American and Caribbean \r\nGroup will submit a draft amendment today removing \r\nthe language that goes against the decision of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. We strongly urge all States \r\nto vote in favour of the draft amendment. If the draft \r\namendment fails, we further strongly urge those present \r\nto vote against the draft resolution. which should take \r\nnote of the report of the Human Rights Council in its \r\nentirety and not undermine the Council by relitigating \r\na mandate.\r\nMrs. Rodríguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Human Rights Council was established as a result of \r\nthe need to address double standards, confrontation and \r\nthe political manipulation of the now-defunct Human \r\nRights Commission. We must make every effort to \r\navoid a repeat of the negative practices that discredited \r\nthe Human Rights Commission — practices that \r\nCuba roundly rejects. We reiterate our concern about \r\nthe tendency in the Council to impose selectivity and \r\ndouble standards relative to the consideration of human \r\nrights situations, as is reflected in the report (A/71/53) \r\ncurrently under discussion. Today we must rescue the \r\nCouncil from the selectivity and political manipulation \r\nthat characterize its work in the treatment of country \r\nsituations. Cooperation and respectful dialogue must \r\nbe the guidelines for its work. \r\nCuba notes that the Universal Periodic Review \r\nhas been strengthened as the sole existing universal \r\nmechanism for a comprehensive analysis of the human \r\nrights situations in all countries; it is the main element \r\nthat distinguishes the Council from the Human Rights \r\nCommission. That mechanism has proved to be a means \r\nfor international cooperation on human rights issues, \r\non the basis of constructive dialogue and respect for \r\nthe principles of universality, objectivity, impartiality \r\nand non-selectivity. Those principles must be equally \r\nrespected by the special procedures of the Council and \r\nby the human rights treaty bodies, which, furthermore, \r\nmust observe the code of conduct that was adopted \r\nwhen the Council was established as an institution. \r\nAs long as an unfair and exclusive international \r\neconomic and political order persists, the Council must \r\ncontinue to take a stance in favour of a democratic \r\nand equitable international order. As long as we have \r\ninstances in which unilateral coercive measures prevail \r\nand rigid blockades are maintained — as is the case for \r\nCuba, which has endured a blockade for more than 50 \r\nyears now — the Council must reject those measures \r\nand call for them to end. The Council must ensure \r\nthat the right to international solidarity is urgently \r\naddressed, with a view to overcoming the serious \r\nglobal challenges that are posed by economic, financial, \r\nenergy, environmental and food crises. \r\nIn response to the recommendation the Human \r\nRights Council made to the General Assembly in \r\nresolution 32/28, my delegation has submitted a \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Declaration on the Right to \r\nPeace”. The underlying idea is that peace, which is \r\nalready recognized as a fundamental condition for the \r\nenjoyment of all human rights, should also receive due \r\nrecognition as the right of all persons, both individually \r\nand collectively, to contribute to efforts to achieve peace \r\nand enjoy an environment of harmony in which all their \r\nneeds are met and their individual and collective rights \r\nare fully respected. \r\nCuba will continue working to promote the \r\nrights of all peoples to self-determination, peace and \r\ndevelopment through the realization of the right to \r\nfood, the establishment of a democratic and equitable \r\ninternational order, the fight against racism, xenophobia \r\nand all forms of discrimination and the realization of \r\ncultural rights and respect for diversity. Cuba reiterates \r\nits everlasting commitment to promoting and respecting \r\nhuman rights for all. \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 13/29\r\nMrs. Al-Duwailah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAn important agenda item is under discussion today \r\nin the General Assembly. I would like to thank the \r\nHuman Rights Council for its report (A/71/53), which \r\nsummarizes the work to promote human rights in the \r\ninternational community and its ongoing endeavour to \r\nentrench and defend the human rights principles. We \r\nalso congratulate the States elected on 28 October to \r\nmembership of the Council for the period 2017-2019 \r\nand wish them every success during their term. \r\nThe report reviewed several issues relating to \r\nhuman rights and their protection, including the \r\nrealization of fundamental rights. It also addressed \r\nthe human rights situation in some States, focusing on \r\ntheir role in international institutions and the efforts \r\nto promote all aspects of cooperation with various \r\ncountries in the world. Moreover, it addressed issues \r\nof the utmost importance relating to trafficking in \r\npersons and the rights of people with special needs, as \r\nwell as the acceleration of efforts to eliminate all forms \r\nof intolerance and violence against women. We would \r\nstress that the full implementation of the concept of \r\nhuman rights is the responsibility of States and requires \r\nthe concerted efforts of the international community. \r\nThe challenges facing our world and the difficulties \r\nthat some people face in acquiring the most basic \r\nmeans of subsistence, such as housing, food and \r\nmedicine, make it incumbent upon the international \r\ncommunity to strive to do more. We welcome the \r\nadoption in September of the New York Declaration for \r\nRefugees and Migrants, which expressly acknowledges \r\nthe magnitude of the suffering of populations around \r\nthe world as a result of tragic humanitarian crises. We \r\nalso welcome all international efforts to promote and \r\nprotect the rights of displaced persons, including the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nToday marks an important event, which is the \r\nentry into force of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange. All such measures reflect the seriousness \r\nof the international community in protecting and \r\npromoting human rights. I would like to note that my \r\nGovernment, guided by the principles of the Paris \r\nAgreement, has approved a bill on the establishment of \r\na national human rights institution that will promote the \r\nprotection of human rights and public freedoms, in line \r\nwith current international conventions. Furthermore, \r\nit has established national mechanisms to promote \r\nhuman rights.\r\nCertainly, the concept of human rights is \r\nclosely linked to the achievement of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, as illustrated by the fact that \r\nthe progress of people is measured by the degree of \r\ntheir commitment to human rights. The Charter of \r\nthe United Nations also urges us to promote human \r\nrights and respect fundamental freedoms. A great \r\ndeal of humanitarian assistance is provided through \r\nnon-governmental and governmental institutions and \r\ninternational organizations, including the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\n(UNHCR), which believes it imperative to establish \r\ninternational peace and security in order to promote \r\nrespect for human rights. In that vein, Kuwait has \r\nhosted three international conferences to support \r\nthe humanitarian situation in Syria, in line with the \r\nUNHCR report and resolution 28/20. Kuwait also \r\nparticipated in co-hosting the Supporting Syria and \r\nthe Region Conference, held in London on 4 February, \r\nwhich further raised funds to fulfil the immediate and \r\nlong-term requirements of those affected by the crisis \r\nin Syria. \r\nWe feel pain and sorrow regarding the continuing \r\nacts of violence in Syria, which have been taking lives \r\nand have devastated poverty. My delegation stresses \r\nthe importance of concerted urgent international action \r\naimed at finding a political settlement to the crisis in \r\nSyria that will make it possible for the Syrian people \r\nto realize their aspirations to live their lives in freedom \r\nand dignity. \r\nIn that respect, as we are discussing human rights, \r\nwe must strongly condemn the oppressive policies and \r\npractices of Israel in violating the most rudimentary \r\nhuman rights of the unarmed Palestinian people in their \r\noccupied territories. We call upon the international \r\ncommunity to assume its responsibility to compel Israel \r\nto abide by the General Assembly resolution promoting \r\ninternational legitimacy and cease its expansionist \r\npolicies, respect the principles of international human \r\nrights and respect its obligations under the Geneva \r\nConvention 1949 relative to the protection of civilians.\r\nIn conclusion, Kuwait affirms its commitment to \r\nsupport all international efforts to promote and protect \r\nhuman rights. We must seek to benefit from past \r\nexperiences in order to achieve our aspirations of a \r\nworld of peace and stability, where the preservation of \r\nhuman rights will be a linchpin and an inalienable right. \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n14/29 16-36139\r\nMr. Lukyantsev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): International cooperation in the field of \r\nhuman rights over the past years has been of increasing \r\nimportance. The United Nations has the unique and \r\nimportant task of ensuring the conditions for a truly \r\nequitable dialogue among States. That dialogue should \r\nallow for the fullest possible realization of human \r\nrights in all countries of the world. The Human Rights \r\nCouncil plays a particularly crucial role in that work. \r\nIn that connection, allow me to congratulate the \r\nrepresentatives of the States elected to the Council last \r\nweek and to express the hope that they will contribute \r\nto constructive cooperation aimed at promoting and \r\nprotecting human rights as enshrined in universal \r\ninternational instruments. \r\nWe must note, however, that the agenda of the \r\nCouncil has become a tactical tool for promoting the \r\ninterests of individual States and groups. Discussions \r\nare increasingly turning into the airing of political \r\ngrievances, patronizing attitudes and the defamation of \r\nStates. Moreover, unjustified geographical imbalances \r\nwith respect to the various human rights situations \r\nbeing considered do not reflect true trends; rather, they \r\nare the result of politically motivated actions.\r\nWe are also struck by certain dubious activities, \r\nincluding the promotion of supposedly progressive \r\nreforms and initiatives that in practice translate into the \r\nerosion of the intergovernmental nature of the work of the \r\nUnited Nations and its human rights bodies, attributing \r\nsubsidiary bodies to functions that they should not \r\nperform. We regret that the Council is becoming a \r\nplatform for a test-run for such controversial initiatives.\r\nWe are categorically against using the Council \r\nto include various politically charged matters on the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly, including the idea \r\nof referring human rights situations to the Security \r\nCouncil and the International Criminal Court. We \r\nbelieve that United Nations bodies charged with human \r\nrights mandates should not interfere in the purviews \r\nof other bodies of the United Nations, including on the \r\nissues of international security, development, counter-\r\nterrorism and human trafficking. The integration of \r\nhuman rights issues into the activities of various other \r\nbodies of the United Nations should have its limits. It \r\nmust not lead to a duplication of functions. That applies, \r\nabove all, to the Glion Human Rights Dialogue, which \r\nis promoted by the Human Rights Council. \r\nWe would like to express concern about the fact \r\nthat the agenda of the Human Rights Council deals with \r\nmatters that are not within its mandate and jurisdiction, \r\nincluding the responsibility to protect the international \r\nlegal status of territories and their related qualifications. \r\nWe are alarmed by the relentless attempts of individual \r\nStates that, instead of seeking a unifying agenda, \r\nbring to the consideration of the Council deliberately \r\nconfrontational topics. The latest example was the \r\nresolution of the Council on issues of sexual orientation \r\nand gender identity and the establishment of the post \r\nof independent expert on the matter. That does not \r\nimprove the human rights situation, but instead further \r\ndivides members of the Council.\r\nWe are worried that, given the expansion of \r\nthe special procedures system of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the practice of exceeding mandates and \r\nthe duplication of functions will become features of \r\nmany of those mechanisms. In our view, the primary \r\ntask of the Council should be to restore the mutually \r\nrespectful nature of intergovernmental dialogue. That \r\nis based on the fact that the fundamental principle of \r\nthe Council’s work should be equitable cooperation \r\nbased on compliance with the principle of the sovereign \r\nequality of States.\r\nWe believe that the only objective mechanism \r\nfor monitoring compliance with human rights is the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review. We believe that in order \r\nto increase the effectiveness of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s work, the focus should be on the provision of \r\ntechnical assistance to States that express their consent.\r\nIn conclusion, we would like to note that it is \r\nimportant for the Human Rights Council not to erode \r\nthe trust bestowed upon it by the General Assembly \r\nin 2006. The worrisome trends in the work of the \r\nCouncil I just mentioned could bring the Council \r\nto a status resembling that of the Commission on \r\nHuman Rights as it stood in the end of the 1990s and \r\nthe beginning of the 2000s. That would once again \r\ndiscredit the work of the United Nations in promoting \r\nand defending human rights.\r\nMs. Kumar (India): We welcome the President of the \r\nHuman Rights Council, Ambassador Choi Kyong-lim, \r\nand we thank him for his comprehensive presentation.\r\nThe year 2016 marks the tenth anniversary of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Anniversaries provide an \r\nopportune moment for assessment and introspection. \r\nWe feel that it is worth analyzing the progress that \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 15/29\r\nthe Council has made towards accomplishing its dual \r\nmandate of promoting and protecting human rights, \r\nand to reflect on its achievements and challenges and \r\nprescribe change where necessary, with the objective of \r\nshaping a stronger and more effective Council.\r\nThe Human Rights Council evolved from the \r\npolitical will to avoid the shortcomings of the \r\nCommission on Human Rights. While celebrating \r\nthe tenth anniversary of the Council, we must also \r\nremain mindful of the reasons for its establishment \r\nand avoid repeating the mistakes of the past. In that \r\ncontext, we must mention that intrusive monitoring \r\nand finger-pointing while dealing with specific human \r\nrights situations in various countries is inimical to the \r\nobjectives of the Council. India believes in an open, \r\ninclusive approach based on dialogue, consultation \r\nand cooperation.\r\nAs a signatory to both of the principal Covenants on \r\nhuman rights and the major human rights instruments, \r\nIndia has consistently promoted human rights. India \r\nmade important contributions to the drafting the \r\nUniversal Declaration on Human Rights, especially \r\nhighlighting the need to reflect gender equality.\r\nIndia’s engagement with the Human Rights Council \r\nsince its inception has been primarily guided by the \r\nsignificance that it attaches to the mechanisms of the \r\nUnited Nations that serve to frame the international \r\ndiscourse on human rights. It has been our constant \r\nendeavour to constructively engage with the processes \r\nof those bodies. In the relatively short span of 10 years, \r\nthe Council has encountered enormous challenges on \r\na vast array of issues relating to migrants, refugees, \r\nterrorism, violent extremism, climate change, \r\ndevelopment and others. Over the years, the Council has \r\nevolved into a forum for voluntary participation and the \r\nsharing of national experiences and best practices in the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights. We strongly \r\nbelieve that, in order to ensure its continued relevance \r\nand further success, the Council must continue to \r\nstrengthen its adherence to the fundamental principles \r\nof universality, transparency, impartiality, objectivity, \r\nnon-selectivity and constructive international dialogue, \r\nwhile seeking to realize human rights for all.\r\nIt is among the Council’s core responsibilities to \r\nensure that the indivisibility, interrelatedness and \r\ninterdependence of all human rights, including the right \r\nto development, are treated in a fair and equal manner. \r\nThe right to development is an inalienable human \r\nright central to the purposes and mission of the United \r\nNations. However, a caveat in that regard is in order: the \r\nnotion of the universality of rights does not imply the \r\nuniformity of values and systems. For a more meaningful \r\nand productive discharge of its responsibilities, the \r\nCouncil would do well to bear in mind the significance \r\nof national and regional particularities and the various \r\nhistorical, cultural and religious backgrounds in its \r\ndialogue with its Member States.\r\nIndia believes that the Council’s Universal \r\nPeriodic Review mechanism provides a forum for \r\nnon-politicized, non-selective and non-confrontational \r\ndiscussion among Member States. The relevance of \r\nthose characteristics continues to remain strong as \r\nwe approach the conclusion of the second cycle of the \r\nreview mechanism. There are suggestions emanating \r\nfrom some quarters that the process of that mechanism \r\nneeds to be reviewed in order to make it more effective. \r\nWe reiterate that the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism should not be tinkered with, because \r\nany such attempt carries the potential of diluting the \r\nuniversal support that it currently enjoys. The process \r\nis less than 10 years old, and it is therefore too early to \r\npronounce on its ultimate effectiveness or to identify \r\nspecific needs to reform it.\r\nWe would also like to mention that the success \r\nof dialogues with special procedures hinges on their \r\ncontinued independence and impartiality and on their \r\ncarrying out their entrusted tasks with responsibility \r\nand sensitivity in accordance with their mandates. The \r\ncomments and recommendations by mandate-holders \r\nshould also conform to their respective mandates. The \r\noutcomes of their efforts need to be constructive and not \r\ndriven by ideological and ulterior motives. That would \r\nhelp the Governments concerned to fully acknowledge \r\ntheir reports and take the requisite follow-up actions. \r\nIt would be useful for mandate-holders and Member \r\nStates if misguided attempts at self-glorification and \r\npublicity through unfounded generalizations were \r\navoided, including the issuance of joint press releases \r\non issues beyond their mandates.\r\nIt is our long-held belief that human rights issues \r\ncannot be approached in isolation, while ignoring the \r\ncomplex and intricate relationship between human \r\nrights, development, democracy and international \r\ncooperation. The challenges of poverty eradication, \r\narmed conflict, terrorism, democracy deficit and \r\nimpunity continue to deprive millions of people from \r\nthe full enjoyment of their human rights. Democracy, \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n16/29 16-36139\r\ngood governance, the rule of law and access to justice \r\nand the engagement of civil society are essential for \r\nsafeguarding fundamental freedoms and for promoting \r\nand protecting human rights for all.\r\nIn conclusion, India remains committed to making \r\nthe Human Rights Council a strong, effective and \r\nefficient body capable of promoting and protecting \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all in a \r\ntransparent, cooperative and non-selective manner.\r\nMs. Naeem (Maldives): At the outset, my delegation \r\nwould like to thank His Excellency Ambassador Choi \r\nKyonglim, Permanent Representative of the Republic of \r\nKorea to the United Nations Office in Geneva, for his \r\nadmirable work as the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and for presenting the Council’s annual report \r\n(A/71/53) to the General Assembly.\r\nThe year 2016 marks an important milestone in the \r\nhistory of the Human Rights Council. As we celebrate \r\nthe tenth anniversary of the Council, we would like \r\nto take this opportunity to commend the Council for \r\nits achievements and to reaffirm our support for the \r\nCouncil. Since its inception, in 2006, the Council has \r\nmade substantive contributions to the improvement \r\nof the world’s human rights situation. Not only has \r\nit proved to be an effective institution in protecting \r\nhuman rights across the world, it has also played a \r\nsignificant role in promoting constructive international \r\ndialogue and improving international human rights \r\nstandards and their implementation. The Maldives is \r\nproud to have been actively engaged in the process as \r\na member of the Council for six out of its 10 years. At \r\na time when human rights violations and abuses are \r\nrapidly increasing the world over, and when extremism \r\nand terrorism pose ever-increasing threats to the global \r\ncommunity as a whole, the Maldives welcomes the \r\ninitiatives undertaken by the Council in addressing the \r\nmany human rights violations that plague our world.\r\nOne of the most important contributions made by \r\nthe Human Rights Council to the world’s human rights \r\nsituation is the Universal Periodic Review process. In \r\nestablishing a unique mechanism in which the human \r\nrights of all countries are assessed and measured on \r\nan equal footing and on an equal basis, the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review process has come to be widely \r\nrecognized as one of the biggest achievements of the \r\nCouncil. We are pleased to note that the Maldives \r\ncompleted its second review under the Universal \r\nPeriodic review process this year. We believe that \r\nthe review process is of crucial importance, and we \r\nreiterate our support for efforts to further strengthen \r\nthe process.\r\nAnother noteworthy development is the special \r\nprocedures mechanism of the Human Rights Council. \r\nThe special procedures system, through the reports of \r\nthe special procedures mandate-holders, provides an \r\neffective basis for dialogue and debate, both among \r\nStates members of the Council and between States \r\nMembers of the United Nations and the Council.\r\nWe welcome the Human Rights Council’s most \r\nrecent special session, on the situation of human rights \r\nin the Syrian Arab Republic, and the recent situation \r\nin Aleppo and the attention given by the Council to the \r\ngrave human rights violations being committed against \r\nthe people of Aleppo. The Maldives calls upon the \r\nCouncil to step up its efforts to that end and to adopt \r\na more proactive role in addressing the grave human \r\nrights violations committed against the women, men \r\nand children of Aleppo.\r\nSimilarly, while the Council has continued with \r\nits traditional set of resolutions on the human rights \r\nviolations and atrocities committed by Israel against \r\nthe Palestinian people, the Maldives calls upon the \r\nCouncil to take strong and effective measures to relieve \r\nthe plight of the people of Palestine.\r\nThis year is also a particularly significant year \r\nfor the Maldives as we conclude our second term \r\nin the Human Rights Council. We are proud of the \r\ncontributions that we have made to the work of the \r\nCouncil. We especially recall our efforts to integrate \r\nclimate change into the Council’s agenda through \r\nCouncil resolution 71/23. Small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) such as the Maldives are at the forefront \r\nof feeling the impacts of climate change. The Maldives \r\nhas long advocated that the issue of climate change \r\nand its impacts on populations must be viewed through \r\na human rights lens. We are pleased to note that, at \r\nits thirty-second session, the Council continued to \r\nrecognize the importance of addressing the adverse \r\nconsequences of climate change on the full and effective \r\nenjoyment of human rights.\r\nThe increased engagement with the Voluntary \r\nTechnical Assistance Trust Fund to Support Participation \r\nof Least Developed Countries and SIDS in the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council is another important \r\ndevelopment that we are proud to see materialize. In \r\naddition to actively participating in setting up the Trust \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 17/29\r\nFund, we were able to secure the participation of all \r\nSIDS not represented in Geneva in the Council session \r\nheld there in June this year, which saw the universal \r\nparticipation of all SIDS for the first time.\r\nDespite our limitations and our status as a small \r\nisland developing State, the Maldives has maintained \r\na strong presence on the Human Rights Council. \r\nWe are proud to have given a voice to the smallest \r\nmembers of the international community, and we \r\nwill continue lending our voice for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nin the coming years. My delegation is pleased to note \r\nthat the Government of the Maldives has announced \r\nits candidacy for membership in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the term 2018-2020. The Maldives remains \r\nsteadfast in its efforts to continue keeping development \r\nand the empowerment of all people central to the \r\nCouncil’s agenda. Human rights remain the heart of \r\nour developmental efforts, especially those of the most \r\nvulnerable — the disabled, women and children.\r\nWhile the Council has achieved considerable \r\nsuccess during its short existence, it can continue to live \r\nup to its mandate only if it is guided by the principles \r\nupon which it was founded, namely, universality, \r\nimpartiality, objectivity, constructive international \r\ndialogue and cooperation. It is our hope that the next \r\ndecade will see the Council become even stronger, \r\nmore efficient and more effective.\r\nI conclude by reaffirming our continued support \r\nfor the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms. Let \r\nme also take this opportunity to reaffirm our country’s \r\ndedication to working with the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and to \r\ncooperating with other Member States in the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights globally.\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland wishes to thank the President of the Human \r\nRights Council for introducing the Council’s report \r\n(A/71/53). We express our gratitude and congratulations \r\nfor his commitment during his presidency of the \r\nCouncil over the past year. He bore particularly great \r\nresponsibility during this tenth anniversary year of the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nThat occasion allowed priority courses of action to \r\nbe identified, which must now be implemented in order \r\nto strengthen the pillar of human rights within the United \r\nNations as a whole and to counteract the deliberate \r\nefforts to undermine human rights institutions that have \r\nregularly been witnessed. In that context, Switzerland \r\nwould like to reaffirm its position concerning the draft \r\nresolution on the report of the Human Rights Council \r\npresented in the Third Committee (A/C.3/71/L.46). That \r\ndraft resolution is not necessary. The Human Rights \r\nCouncil is a subsidiary organ of the General Assembly, \r\nand not one of its Committees. We are concerned by the \r\nfact that once again a draft resolution on the report of the \r\nHuman Rights Council seeks to isolate a single Council \r\nresolution by calling for its consideration to be deferred. \r\nThe Council resolution in question seeks to create \r\nthe mandate of the independent expert on protection \r\nagainst violence and discrimination based on sexual \r\norientation and gender identity. Switzerland reiterates \r\nits support for the establishment of that mandate and \r\ncalls upon all States to respect the independence of the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nThe 10 years of the Human Rights Council’s \r\nexistence have seen an increase in the importance of civil-\r\nsociety participation in the work of the United Nations, \r\nparticularly in monitoring the implementation of the \r\nHuman Rights Council’s decisions, recommendations \r\nand mechanisms. Ensuring greater inclusion and \r\nprotection for civil society is therefore an investment \r\nin enhancing the impact, efficiency and credibility of \r\nthe Council. In that regard, Switzerland is concerned \r\nabout numerous cases of intimidation and reprisals \r\nagainst members of civil society as they exercise their \r\nfundamental rights by providing first-hand information \r\nto representatives of United Nations mechanisms. \r\nSwitzerland is grateful for the commitment to the \r\nfollow-up to such cases and urges the international \r\ncommunity to take further action to protect those who \r\ndefend human rights, especially those who cooperate \r\nwith the Council and its mechanisms.\r\nFurthermore, Switzerland strongly believes that \r\nthe relationship between human rights and peace and \r\nsecurity is worthy of special attention, not least in \r\nview of its potential in terms of conflict prevention. \r\nThe appeal of 13 June “Put Human Rights at the Heart \r\nof Conflict Prevention”, launched by Switzerland and \r\nother Member States, calls for an enhanced exchange \r\nof information on conflict prevention between the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the Security Council. \r\nSwitzerland calls upon all Member States to join the 70 \r\nStates that already support the appeal and to commit to \r\nits implementation.\r\nWhile the increase in the Council’s workload \r\nconfirms the relevance of its mandate, Switzerland \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n18/29 16-36139\r\ndoes not believe that that workload is sustainable in the \r\nmedium term. It is crucial that consideration continue \r\non how to optimize working methods and implement \r\nthe relevant proposals already on the table. At the same \r\ntime, it is vital to improve the working atmosphere in \r\nthe Human Rights Council. My delegation points in \r\nparticular to the lack of transparency in an increasing \r\nnumber of negotiations and resolutions, the growing \r\nand combined use of written and oral amendments and \r\nrequests to vote on concerns that were never expressed \r\nduring informal negotiations. All of that is fostering \r\na mood of confrontation. Switzerland calls upon all \r\nStates to work constructively on Council matters so as \r\nto enhance its credibility and efficiency.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Argentina wishes to express its gratitude to \r\nAmbassador Choi Kyonglim, President of the Human \r\nRights Council, for his presence today in the General \r\nAssembly and welcomes the report (A/71/53) on the \r\nactivities of the Council over the past year.\r\nFirst of all, we would like to point out that we \r\nbelieve that it is relevant to maintain close coordination \r\nbetween New York and Geneva on the human rights \r\nagenda. We are therefore very grateful for this \r\nopportunity to express our views on the recent work \r\nof the Council. Argentina has always been, and will \r\ncontinue to be, a strong advocate for the independence, \r\nwork and achievements of the Human Rights Council in \r\npromoting, respecting and protecting human rights. We \r\nfirmly believe that the Council should be on an equal \r\nfooting with the principal organs of the United Nations. \r\nFor Argentina, the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights is a State policy that reflects the main desires \r\nand concerns of Argentine society. The defence and \r\npromotion of human rights is a central element of our \r\ncountry’s foreign policy.\r\nArgentina would also like to take this opportunity \r\nto highlight the role of the Council in ensuring that \r\nhuman rights are universally prioritized. The Council’s \r\nestablishment has made it possible to strengthen \r\ndialogue and various channels of cooperation among \r\nStates in order to promote universal respect for the \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms of all people, \r\nwhich will result in their further contribution to \r\ninternational development, peace and security. In that \r\nregard, the international community should continue \r\nto work together to strengthen the role of the Council \r\nin peace restoration and post-conflict and transitional \r\njustice processes. Initiatives taken to establish or \r\nrefine national plans and regional strategies should be \r\ncomplemented and developed in cooperation with the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nWe would particularly like to express our concern \r\nabout recent actions designed to disregard the Council’s \r\nmandate or to undermine its legitimacy as the main body \r\nwithin the United Nations system for the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights. We are deeply concerned \r\nthat the legal basis that enabled the Council to create \r\nthe mandate of the independent expert on protection \r\nagainst violence and discrimination based on sexual \r\norientation and gender identity — who was appointed at \r\nthe latest session of the Council — is being questioned, \r\nwhen it was legally established by resolution 32/2 of the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nWithout going into unnecessary detail on the \r\nlegitimacy of the fight against any form of violence or \r\ndiscrimination and in accordance with the provisions \r\nof the Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, we \r\nfirmly believe that it is unacceptable to attempt to \r\ndisregard a special mandate legally established by \r\nthe Council through a draft resolution of the Third \r\nCommittee. We are convinced that the scale, gravity \r\nand generalized nature of violence and discrimination \r\nagainst individuals based on their actual or perceived \r\nsexual orientation or gender identity requires a specific \r\nresponse from the international community.\r\nAmong the other notable actions of the Council \r\nare the initiative presented together with Brazil for \r\nthe renewal of the mandate of the independent expert \r\non the rights of older persons and the resolution \r\npresented with Switzerland and Morocco on human \r\nrights and transitional justice. We believe that it is \r\nrelevant to explore the contribution of transitional \r\njustice to the prevention of grave violations and abuses \r\nof human rights and serious violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law, including genocide, war crimes, \r\nethnic cleansing and crimes against humanity.\r\nWithout respect for the existing institutions and \r\nmandates of United Nations bodies, we will find it \r\nincredibly difficult to meet the expectations of our \r\npeoples in ensuring the defence and protection of \r\nhuman rights. That is why all Member States must \r\nmake the commitment to respect the independence \r\nand integrity of the mandate of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil in accordance with resolution 60/251 and other \r\nrelevant resolutions.\r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 19/29\r\nIn conclusion, we welcome the countries recently \r\nelected to the Council and reiterate our unyielding \r\ncommitment to uphold the independence and work of \r\nthe Human Rights Council.\r\nMs. Bogyay (Hungary): We would like to thank \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council for \r\npresenting the Council’s annual report (A/71/53) to the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nHungary aligns itself with the statement delivered \r\non behalf of the European Union.\r\nThe establishment of the Human Rights Council, \r\n10 years ago, was a major achievement that put human \r\nrights at the centre of the United Nations system. By \r\nestablishing the Council, Member States acknowledged \r\nthat there was no peace, security or development \r\nwithout respect for, and the protection of, human \r\nrights. Hungary strongly believes that the Council and \r\nits Universal Periodic Review mechanism represent the \r\nbest universal framework for achieving that goal. Over \r\nthe past 10 years, the Human Rights Council has proved \r\nto be a key player and a central forum in the universal \r\npromotion and protection of human rights. Hungary has \r\nbeen an active player in the Council’s work since it was \r\nestablished. Hungary was a member of the Council from \r\n2009 to 2012 and served as one of its Vice-Presidents in \r\n2012. We look forward to serving on the Council again \r\nand would like to take this opportunity to thank all \r\nMember States for their strong support for our election.\r\nOver the past decade, we have led initiatives in \r\nour national capacity on a number of thematic issues \r\nwithin the Council, including on the independence of \r\nthe judiciary and the prevention of reprisals against \r\nindividuals cooperating with the United Nations. In that \r\nregard, we wish to thank the President of the Council \r\nfor his efforts to highlight the importance of addressing \r\nreprisals against individuals cooperating with the \r\nCouncil. Hungary also plays an active role in facilitating \r\nthe exchange of views and in disseminating knowledge \r\nabout the Council and its review mechanism. To that \r\nend, the Ministry for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nHungary continues to host the annual Budapest Human \r\nRights Forum, which was launched in 2008. Those \r\nconferences offer an opportunity to exchange views \r\namong representatives of Governments, international \r\norganizations, civil society and academia.\r\nThe next Budapest Human Rights Forum will take \r\nplace on 18 and 19 November and will focus on the tenth \r\nanniversary of the Human Rights Council and other \r\nmajor human rights issues, including the prevention of \r\nmass atrocities through the responsibility to protect. \r\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is also at the core of the upcoming Forum. \r\nAs a member of the Council, Hungary will, while \r\nbeing firm in supporting its principles, be open and \r\nattentive to all views and opinions represented in the \r\nCouncil and will work with its partners to build bridges \r\nand understanding.\r\nWe are committed to fostering cooperation among \r\nmembers of the Council by playing the role of facilitator \r\namong countries with different cultural, social and \r\neconomic backgrounds. Consensus-building on issues \r\nsuch as gender equality, women’s empowerment, \r\nchildren’s rights, minority rights, the fight against \r\nall kinds of discrimination and the protection of \r\nvulnerable groups will be of the utmost importance in \r\nthe coming period, in particular in the context of the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nFurthermore, we will continue to be a proactive \r\nplayer in the fight against any form of sexual exploitation \r\nand the various forms of modern-day slavery, which, \r\naccording to recent estimates, affect 45 million women, \r\nmen and children worldwide. Hungary believes that \r\nMember States should assume political leadership \r\naimed at eradicating that scourge, but we also believe \r\nthat cooperation and collaboration within the United \r\nNations system are very important.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm Hungary’s \r\ndeep commitment to the strengthening of international \r\nhuman rights mechanisms, and in particular the work \r\nand functioning of the Human Rights Council.\r\nMs. Shilo (Israel): Special agenda items, politicized \r\ndebates, biased resolutions, preposterous reports, \r\ndiscriminatory conduct and unfounded accusations \r\ncharacterize the attitude of the Human Rights Council \r\ntowards Israel. Although the Council is mandated to be \r\nunbiased, transparent and apolitical, its seven special \r\nsessions, 66 resolutions, a Special Rapporteur with an \r\nunlimited mandate and a specific agenda item, all of \r\nwhich target Israel, clearly prove otherwise. We believe \r\nthat, instead of stomping in the political swamp, as it \r\nhas been doing for so long with regard to Israel, it is \r\ncrucial that the Human Rights Council finally focus on \r\nits mandate to protect human rights.\r\nAs the United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nHuman Rights recently said, our world today is suffering \r\nfrom countless atrocities, terrible humanitarian crises \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n20/29 16-36139\r\nand increased xenophobia, racism and prejudice, which \r\nare greater than any that we have experienced since \r\nthe end of the Second World War. The international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations are faced with \r\nan inexhaustible list of desperate calls for urgent \r\nassistance. The situation in Syria, which is entering its \r\nsixth year, continues along its devastating course, while \r\nnumerous people around the world are falling prey to \r\ncrimes such as extermination, murder, enslavement, \r\ntorture, rape and starvation — crimes that shock the \r\nconscience of humankind.\r\nA revision of the resources allocated to deal with \r\nthe Human Rights Council’s biased agenda item 7 will \r\ndefinitely allow the Council to better address the real \r\nand urgent concerns that the international community \r\nshould deal with. Israel is a strong democracy in \r\nthe Middle East, and, while it faces many security \r\nchallenges, it is fully committed to respect all human \r\nrights, including those of its own citizens. Israel will \r\ncontinue to cooperate with those who really care about \r\nhuman rights and to firmly object to any attempt to \r\nabuse those rights for political ends.\r\nMs. García Gutiérrez (Costa Rica) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We thank the President of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for his briefing, and we welcome the report \r\n(A/71/53) on the vital work that body carries out. Costa \r\nRica commends the continued strengthening of the \r\nCouncil and the implementation of its mandates.\r\nThis year has been particularly important for the \r\nhuman rights system. Last month we commemorated the \r\nfiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the International \r\nCovenants on Human Rights. True to its tradition, Costa \r\nRica was the first country to ratify both Covenants, on \r\n29 November 1968. As a matter of principle, our country \r\nwill always seek the promotion and protection of all \r\nhuman rights without distinction, in all circumstances \r\nand places. We also welcome the commemoration of the \r\ntenth anniversary of the establishment of the Human \r\nRights Council and are pleased by its institutional \r\nconsolidation as the body responsible for promoting \r\nuniversal respect for the protection of all human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms for all individuals, without \r\ndistinction, in a just and equitable manner and guided \r\nby the principles of impartiality, objectivity and \r\nnon-selectivity.\r\nWe appreciate the work performed by the Council \r\nin consolidating the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism, which treats all States equally when \r\nreviewing their human rights situations on the basis \r\nof the principles of cooperation and constructive \r\ninternational dialogue. We welcome the broadening \r\nof the Council’s sphere of action, which has been \r\nmade possible by its special procedures. We therefore \r\nsee fit to reiterate our firm support for the work \r\nand independence of the Council. Nevertheless, we \r\nmust also express deep concern over certain current \r\npractices that could undermine its institutionality and \r\nits legitimacy. Practices such as questioning the legal \r\nbasis that entitles the Council to establish a mandate \r\nare unacceptable. The Human Rights Council must be \r\nrecognized as the primary body of the United Nations \r\nfor the promotion and protection of human rights and, \r\nas such, its institutionality and independence must \r\nbe preserved.\r\nWe consider all efforts aimed at strengthening the \r\nCouncil and the human rights system to be relevant and \r\nindispensable, and have therefore welcomed the review \r\nprocesses promoted by the President to review the work \r\nand strengthening of the Council. Similarly, and with \r\nthe goal of bolstering the human rights system, we must \r\nensure the institutionality of the Office of the United \r\nNations High Commissioner for Human Rights and \r\nguarantee it full independence and the ability to carry \r\nout its mandate. Costa Rica, as a country historically \r\ncommitted to human rights and as one of the proponents \r\nof the establishment of that Office, believes that the \r\nrobustness of the Office’s mandate derives from its \r\ntotal and complete independence. In order for that to \r\nbe possible, and pursuant to our commitment to human \r\nrights, we urge that the necessary resources from the \r\nregular United Nations budget be allocated to the \r\nOffice of the High Commissioner so that it can have the \r\nnecessary tools to fully carry out its mandate.\r\nThe growth of the human rights protection \r\nsystem is evidence of its importance in the United \r\nNations architecture but at the same time has revealed \r\nchallenges that we need to overcome. We are convinced \r\nthat the system can be improved. A good example of \r\nthat is the strengthening of the treaty body system, \r\nwhich culminated in the adoption of resolution 68/268, \r\nin April 2014. We are grateful to the Office of the High \r\nCommissioner for recently issuing its first report on the \r\nimplementation of the resolution, which reaffirms the \r\ngrowing need to support the organs of the system with \r\na view to ensuring their sustainability.\r\nThe Human Rights Council must be strengthened. \r\nBut we must also reflect on ways to enhance the impact \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 21/29\r\nof its work, to avoid the dispersal of effort and to act in \r\nthe face of grave and systematic violations of human \r\nrights all around the world, especially in conflict \r\nsituations. We are concerned over the increasing \r\nviolence on the planet, which has directly impacted \r\ncivilians and has resulted in millions of displaced \r\npersons and refugees — men, women and children. \r\nToday more than ever, women, girls, boys, persons with \r\ndisabilities, the sexually diverse population, minorities \r\nand all who belong to vulnerable groups or groups in \r\nprecarious circumstances need greater protection. It is \r\na legal and ethical imperative to protect them and all \r\nof humankind.\r\nThat is why we want a Council that will give \r\nequal weight to inter-State and intra-State inequities, \r\nas well as to the grave consequences of discrimination \r\nand social injustice. Similarly, we want a Council \r\nthat will be more visible and have a greater impact on \r\nthe ground — which implies mandates that are more \r\nspecific, better communication with the rest of the \r\nUnited Nations system and greater efforts to respond \r\nto emergency situations in a timely manner, including \r\nthose the High Commissioner of Human Rights and the \r\nspecial procedures refer to the Council. In that regard, \r\nwe reiterate our full commitment to strengthening \r\nthe Human Rights Council, its institutionality and \r\nits independence.\r\nMs. Stener (Norway): Let me begin by thanking the \r\nPresident of the Human Rights Council for introducing \r\nthe Council’s report (A/71/53).\r\n The Human Rights Council is responsible for \r\npromoting universal respect for the protection of all \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without \r\ndistinction of any kind and in a fair and equal manner. \r\nNorway therefore believes that when the Council adopts \r\na resolution, the General Assembly has no role in \r\nreopening or overturning those decisions, and certainly \r\nnot the Third Committee. That undermines the very \r\nrole and independent mandate that we, as States, have \r\ngiven the Human Rights Council. We call on all States \r\nto respect all of the Council’s decisions. Needless to \r\nsay, that call also covers decisions that specifically \r\nestablish special mandate-holders.\r\n We have committed ourselves to ensuring that \r\nall people are entitled to and granted the same set \r\nof rights, irrespective of gender, race, religious and \r\npolitical background or, indeed, sexual orientation and \r\ngender identity. Those rights exist already through, \r\ninter alia, the International Covenants on Civil and \r\nPolitical Rights and on Economic, Social and Cultural \r\nRights, and a number of human rights conventions. \r\nHuman rights are also at the very heart of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, underpinning \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and our ambitious \r\nplan to leave no one behind. It is a call not only to end \r\npoverty but also to tackle inequality and discrimination. \r\nThere is no shortage of rights to be implemented; it \r\nis the implementation itself that is the problem. The \r\nspecial mandate-holders established by the Council are \r\ncrucial to the implementation of the commitment that \r\nwe have made. Their work should not be impeded, it \r\nshould be supported.\r\nNorway applauds resolution 32/2 of the Council, \r\nrecognizing the need to protect persons from the lesbian, \r\ngay, bisexual, transgender and intersex community \r\nfrom discrimination or violence on the basis of sexual \r\norientation and gender identity. We strongly support \r\nthe landmark decision to appoint an independent expert \r\non that topic. \r\nNorway is therefore disappointed and troubled by \r\nthe decision to once again put forward a draft resolution \r\nin the Third Committee that is aimed at reopening \r\ndiscusssion of the Council’s report. We strongly oppose \r\nthe attempt to defer the decision on the establishment \r\nof the independent expert on the protection against \r\nviolence and discrimination based on sexual orientation \r\nand gender identity. That attempted deferral has no \r\nlegal basis. No formal objection was raised on the \r\nappointment of the mandate-holder. The appointment \r\nrigorously respected all the procedural rules of the \r\nCouncil. Norway is dismayed by the blatant disregard \r\nfor the fact that the decision effectively undermines the \r\nmandate and the credibility of the Council and sets a \r\nvery dangerous precedent. We call upon all Member \r\nStates to respect and safeguard the independence of the \r\nCouncil.\r\nMr. Morales López (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe would like to express our gratitude for the report \r\n(A/71/53) presented this morning by the President of \r\nthe Human Rights Council.\r\nToday we have an opportunity, as we did in June \r\nin Geneva, to commemorate the tenth anniversary of \r\nHuman Rights Council. I would like to highlight the \r\npositive impact and transformative actions that the \r\nCouncil has taken. It has had an impact on the lives of \r\nmillions of people around the world. The resolutions, \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n22/29 16-36139\r\ndecisions and mechanisms adopted by the Council, as \r\ndescribed in the report on the twenty-fourth special \r\nsession and the thirty-first and thirty-second sessions, \r\ngive an account of the standing and cross-cutting \r\nnature of human rights in the United Nations system \r\nand the international community. While we recognize \r\nthat contribution, we also believe that we must continue \r\nto work to streamline the number of resolutions to be \r\nadopted and the items to be considered. The progress \r\nthat could be made in that regard would help to improve \r\nthe follow-up and implementation of human rights \r\nrecommendation. It would also enable more time to be \r\nallocated to each agenda item and allow for better use \r\nof our capacities at the national level and within the \r\nUnited Nations itself. Among the actions which lend \r\nthemselves to a joint effort, my delegation would like to \r\nhighlight the activities that make up the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, in which we committed \r\nto leaving no one behind.\r\nColombia is a firm supporter of the independence, \r\nwork and achievements of the Human Rights Council \r\nin promoting, respecting and protecting human rights. \r\nAs is the case with any multilateral forum, controversy \r\nis an inherent part of the dialogue within the Council. \r\nWe should not fear the differences of opinion that \r\noccur in that regard; rather, they should be seen as an \r\nopportunity. Critical and constructive debate is positive \r\nin that it allows us to become aware of different points \r\nof view, enriches our work and enables us make gradual \r\nprogress towards agreement and consensus on the basis \r\nof the shared principle of respect for and promotion of \r\nhuman rights for all without exception. On this tenth \r\nanniversary of the Human Rights Council, we call \r\non States to avoid polarization, continue deepening \r\ndialogue and cooperation and redouble efforts and \r\nstrengthen the Council in order to move forward in \r\ndefending, protecting and promoting human rights \r\nfor all.\r\nMs. Cantada (Philippines): The Philippines thanks \r\nthe President of the Human Rights Council for his \r\nbriefing as well as for his personal contributions to the \r\nwork of the Council. We welcome the report (A/71/53) \r\non the work of the Council.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to congratulate the newly \r\nelected and re-elected members of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil. As a current member of the Council, let \r\nme affirm that the Philippines remains committed \r\nto actively participating in its work in a spirit of \r\nconstructive engagement and cooperation and with \r\nthe aim of upholding international standards of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe Philippines takes note of the newly appointed \r\nspecial procedures mandate-holders. Fully recognizing \r\nthe growing complexity and breadth of human rights \r\nissues in today’s world, we look forward to the \r\nexpertise and renewed vigor that special procedures \r\nmandate-holders will bring to the global human rights \r\nconversation. Our delegation recognizes the important \r\nrole that special procedures play in the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights. Nonetheless, our \r\ndelegation continues to stress that the performance \r\nof their mandates must always be in accordance with \r\nresolution 60/251, which recognizes that the promotion \r\nand protection of human rights should be based on the \r\nprinciples of cooperation and genuine dialogue aimed at \r\nstrengthening the capacity of Member States to comply \r\nwith their human rights obligations.\r\nThe Philippines strongly supports the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review (UPR) mechanism of the Human \r\nRights Council. We firmly believe that the mechanism \r\nis a very useful tool in upholding and promoting human \r\nrights around the world, as it allows the Governments \r\nconcerned and the members of the international \r\ncommunity to constructively engage with each other \r\nwith a view to improving the human rights situation in \r\nline with national priorities and international obligations \r\nand commitments. However, the UPR process should not \r\nbe the be-all and end-all of the human rights protection \r\nand promotion process. It is imperative to put equal, if \r\nnot sharper, focus on providing international support \r\nfor capacity-building in order to enable countries to \r\nbetter implement recommendations.\r\nAs we enter the second decade of the Council’s \r\nexistence, my delegation believes that it is high time \r\nfor economic, social and cultural rights, especially the \r\nright to development, to be given equal importance \r\nalong with civil and political rights in the global \r\nhuman rights discussion. Accordingly, the Philippines \r\ncontinues to work with the international community to \r\nensure that the multidimensional aspects of that right \r\nare mainstreamed in all the relevant areas. Moreover, \r\ngiven that migrants are recognized as positive \r\ncontributors to inclusive and sustainable development \r\nin their countries of origin, transit and destination, we \r\nurge everyone to uphold and respect their economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights.\r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 23/29\r\nWith regard to the work of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, the Philippines supported, among others, the \r\nresolution on unaccompanied migrant children and \r\nadolescents and human rights. The resolution calls \r\nupon countries of origin, transit and destination to \r\nfacilitate family reunification, as appropriate, as an \r\nimportant objective that promotes the welfare and the \r\nbest interests of unaccompanied migrant children and \r\nadolescents. The resolution also calls for avoidance of \r\narbitrary arrest and arbitrary detention.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation wishes to take this \r\nopportunity to express its support for the important \r\nwork of the Human Rights Council and its role in \r\nfostering genuine, inclusive and constructive dialogue.\r\nMs. Kupradze (Georgia): At the outset, let me \r\nthank the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor presenting the Council’s comprehensive report \r\n(A/71/53). We applaud the leadership of President Choi \r\nKyonglim in reinforcing the joint efforts to effectively \r\naddress multiplying human rights challenges. I would \r\nlike to reiterate Georgia’s strong support for the work \r\nof the Human Rights Council and its mechanisms as \r\nkey instruments for promoting and protecting human \r\nrights worldwide.\r\nOver the past decade we have witnessed the \r\nCouncil standing at the forefront of protecting human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. Nevertheless, the \r\nsystematic violation of human rights is a common \r\nphenomenon worldwide. As a result of armed conflicts, \r\nmillions of people are deprived of their fundamental \r\nrights and freedoms as they become victims of armed \r\nhostilities, forcible displacement, expulsion from their \r\nhomes and separation from their families. Violence \r\nand brutality continue to infest the world. Attacks on \r\ninnocent civilians in different parts of the world once \r\nagain illustrate that terrorism and violent extremism \r\nknow no boundaries. In that context, as a member of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, Georgia recently joined \r\nthe Group of Friends on countering and preventing \r\nviolent extremism, which is an important platform \r\nfor promoting the Group’s agenda in Geneva. Georgia \r\nstands ready to further contribute to the work of \r\nthe Group.\r\nWe welcome the work of the Council in addressing \r\nthe human rights situations in Syria, Ukraine, the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, South Sudan, \r\nBurundi and other countries by adopting relevant \r\nresolutions. The Human Rights Council has adopted \r\nseveral landmark thematic resolutions, including \r\nresolutions on protecting human rights defenders and \r\non protection against violence and discrimination \r\nbased on sexual orientation and gender identity. We \r\nwelcome the Council’s establishment of the mandate of \r\nan independent expert to address the issue of violence \r\nand discrimination based on sexual orientation and \r\ngender identity.\r\nGeorgia reiterates its strong support for the \r\nUniversal Periodic Review (UPR), a truly universal \r\nmechanism aimed at assessing and improving the human \r\nrights situation in many countries. As we approach the \r\nnext UPR cycle, I would like to stress the importance \r\nof the universal applicability of the UPR regulations \r\nto all States without distinction or discrimination. \r\nWe must do our utmost to prevent every attempt at \r\ndeviation from those principles, in order to preserve \r\nthe UPR’s universality. We furthermore underscore \r\nthe importance of keeping a continuous focus on the \r\nimplementation of accepted recommendations, and we \r\nwelcome the practice by many States of submitting \r\nvoluntary mid-term implementation reports.\r\nThe effective participation of civil society \r\nin the work of Human Rights Council and its \r\nmechanisms is instrumental. In that context, we \r\nunderline the importance of strengthening the role of \r\nnon-governmental organizations and creating space for \r\nthe voices of civil society to be heard. We believe that \r\nthe role of a strong and inclusive civil society should be \r\ndecisive for the functioning of modern democracies. I \r\nam pleased to underline that civil-society organizations \r\nin Georgia are very actively involved in all major \r\nreform processes.\r\nLet me use this opportunity to refer to the \r\nstatements delivered by the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights during the two most \r\nrecent sessions of the Human Rights Council, which, \r\namong other important issues, covered developments \r\nin two occupied regions of Georgia, Abkhazia and the \r\nTskhinvali region, and also highlighted the necessity \r\nof unhindered access by international human rights \r\nmechanisms to those regions. We fully agree with \r\nthe High Commissioner’s assessments that in conflict \r\nsituations and during foreign occupation the strong \r\ninvolvement and objective reporting of his Office play \r\nan important role in preventing further violations. As \r\nthe basic human rights and fundamental freedoms of \r\nlocal residents in both occupied regions continue to be \r\nviolated in a systematic manner, particular attention by \r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n24/29 16-36139\r\nthe Office of the High Commissioner and the Human \r\nRights Council is of paramount importance.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate our strong \r\ncommitment to continuing our active engagement with \r\nthe Council and its mechanisms and to contributing to \r\nthe common efforts of promoting and protecting human \r\nrights for all.\r\nMr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): The delegation of \r\nUkraine aligns itself with the statement delivered by \r\nthe observer of the European Union and would like to \r\nmake a number of comments in its national capacity.\r\nI thank the President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nMr. Choi Kyonglim of the Republic of Korea, for briefing \r\nthe Committee on the Council’s eleventh annual report \r\n(A/71/53) and for his personal contribution to the work \r\nof the Council, a contribution that he makes not only in \r\nformal Human Rights Council settings, but also through \r\ninitiating thought-provoking informal discussions on \r\nimportant challenges facing the United Nations human \r\nrights pillar.\r\nAfter 10 years of the Council’s work, we see a great \r\nuntapped potential in that body. We believe that any \r\nhuman activity comprises a human rights dimension. \r\nTherefore, we support more synergy between the \r\nHuman Rights Council and the General Assembly and \r\nthe interaction of Human Rights Council with other \r\nbodies, including the Security Council. That applies \r\nto the whole spectrum of the United Nations human \r\nrights machinery: the Universal Periodic Review \r\n(UPR), treaty bodies and the Human Rights Council \r\nspecial procedures.\r\nTen years ago Ukraine issued an open-ended \r\ninvitation to the special procedures, and since then \r\nour invitation has been taken up repeatedly. Just this \r\nyear, the Working Group on the use of mercenaries \r\nand the Special Rapporteur on the human rights of \r\ninternally displaced persons visited our country. We \r\nappreciate the hard and valuable work of those and \r\nother mandate-holders and, despite all the challenges \r\nthat Ukraine now faces, we look forward to continued \r\ncooperation with them and with the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR) in general. We do so because we see a \r\nbenefit in experts’ detecting trouble spots that should \r\nbe dealt with, and because we highly value the Office’s \r\nincreasing ability to provide the necessary technical \r\nassistance to fix the problems detected. In our view, \r\nthe role of the Human Rights Council should be to \r\nencourage and to support such an approach.\r\nAs a country suffering from Russian military \r\naggression and the grave human rights violations \r\ncaused by it, we understand from our own experience \r\nhow much work lies ahead in the areas of preventing \r\nsuch violations, protecting fundamental freedoms and \r\nstrengthening the comprehensive response to threats to \r\nsecurity and human rights. The United Nations Human \r\nRights Monitoring Mission, undertaken at the request of \r\nthe Government of Ukraine, has documented numerous \r\ncompelling accounts of human rights violations, mostly \r\nin the temporarily occupied territories of my country. \r\nWe are deeply peturbed by the fact that the missions of \r\ninternational organizations and special procedures have \r\nno access to monitor the observance of human rights \r\nin the Autonomous Republic of Crimea, where the \r\nsituation continues to deteriorate. Therefore, we believe \r\nthat the grave and systemic nature of the problem with \r\nregard to the observance of human rights in Crimea by \r\nthe Russian occupying authorities requires a separate \r\ndetailed OHCHR report. I have prepared a draft \r\nresolution with that request.\r\nWe find the practice of interactive dialogue when \r\nthe Council discusses OHCHR reports, based on the \r\nMission’s findings on the human rights situation in \r\nUkraine, very useful. As of now, such interactive \r\ndialogues are envisaged to continue until the Council’s \r\nthirty-fifth session.\r\nTransparency, dialogue and cooperation are \r\nimportant in achieving progress in the field of human \r\nrights throughout the world. In that regard, the Universal \r\nPeriodic Review has become an essential tool for the \r\npurposes of international scrutiny. We are approaching \r\nthe third UPR cycle, which will start next year. Ukraine \r\nis now in the process of preparing its national report to \r\nundergo the review in autumn 2017. We fully share the \r\nview that improved implementation and reporting and \r\nbetter measurement of impact should be priorities for \r\nthe third UPR cycle.\r\nThe importance of the role played by the prevention \r\nof human rights violations in overall strategies for the \r\npromotion and protection of all human rights cannot \r\nnot be overemphasized. The discussions held by the \r\nCouncil, the UPR sessions and the work of the special \r\nprocedures and the treaty bodies, together with the \r\ntechnical assistance provided by the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 25/29\r\nall help to strengthen that role. However, there is a need \r\nfor further evidence-based research to advance our \r\nunderstanding and effective implementation of measures \r\nthat can prevent human rights violations. In that regard, \r\non the initiative of Ukraine, together with a core group \r\nof countries, at its thirty-third session the Council \r\nadopted a resolution that asks for the organization of an \r\nexpert workshop to discuss the role and contribution of \r\ncivil society organizations, academia, national human \r\nrights institutions and other relevant stakeholders in the \r\nprevention of human rights abuses. Our expectation is \r\nthat the results of the workshop will provide material \r\nfor a practical toolkit for States and other stakeholders \r\nin the practical application of prevention measures in \r\nthe promotion and protection of human rights.\r\nDespite challenges in the area of security, Ukraine \r\nhas embarked upon the path of comprehensive reforms \r\nwith human rights at their core. The implementation \r\nof our human rights commitments will continue \r\nto be carried out in close collaboration with the \r\nrelevant international organizations, particularly the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to reaffirm the intention \r\nof Ukraine to become a member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the period 2018-2020 with a view to actively \r\nparticipating in further improving the functioning \r\nmethods of the Council and increasing the efficiency \r\nof its activities.\r\nMr. Ghaebi (Islamic Republic of Iran): We would \r\nlike to thank the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nfor his report (A/71/53) to the General Assembly. \r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran has been a consistent \r\nsupporter of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) \r\nmechanism. We believe that the universal periodic \r\nreview has the potential to translate human rights into \r\ncooperative rather than confrontational discourse. This \r\nimportant added value of the Universal Periodic Review \r\nmechanism emanates from its intrinsic principle of \r\nequality in the consideration of the human rights \r\nsituations of all Member States free from selectivity and \r\ndiscrimination. In that regard, the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran, in close cooperation with all relevant stakeholders, \r\nhas commenced the implementation of the accepted \r\nrecommendations arising from the second UPR cycle.\r\nWhile we appreciate the existence of cooperative \r\nand functioning mechanisms in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, such as the UPR, we regret that certain \r\ncountries are continuing to pursue their worn-out policy \r\nof confrontation in place of dialogue and cooperation. \r\nThe sinister insistence on politicization and polarization \r\nof human rights is hard to comprehend. Having said \r\nthat, we strongly recommend that the drivers of the \r\ncountry-specific resolutions against Iran, along with \r\na few backseat drivers, stop pursuing the wrong and \r\nmisleading way of the old rough road of naming and \r\nshaming. Accordingly, the Islamic Republic of Iran \r\ndisassociates itself from the part of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil report contained in document A/71/53, which \r\nincludes the destructive resolution on the so-called \r\nsituation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of \r\nIran.\r\nMeanwhile, guided by the principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations, the Human Rights Council \r\nshould firmly maintain its fairness, impartiality, \r\nnon-selectivity and respect for different religions, \r\nvalues, traditions and cultures and refrain from imposing \r\na single lifestyle and non-consensual concept on others. \r\nWith such understanding, we reiterate our principled \r\nposition of non-recognition of and non-cooperation \r\nwith such mandates as sexual orientation and gender \r\nidentity, which are created by the Council out of the \r\nsphere of internationally recognized human rights.\r\nAs Chair of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries, the Islamic Republic of Iran coordinated a \r\nnumber of resolutions in the Human Rights Council \r\non behalf of the non-member States, including the \r\nright to development, international cooperation in the \r\nfield of human rights, and human rights and unilateral \r\ncoercive measures. We look forward to their effective \r\nimplementation.\r\nThe Islamic Republic of Iran, recalling the \r\nvaguely worded resolution against violent extremism, \r\nwhich the General Assembly backed by consensus at \r\nPresident Rouhani’s initiative, would like to highlight \r\nthe important role of the Human Rights Council \r\nin confronting and addressing violent extremism \r\nconducive to terrorism. The Human Rights Council \r\nhas a role to play in raising global awareness towards \r\nthe imminent threat of terrorism, which is creeping \r\nthroughout the Middle East though, for sure, it will not \r\nstop there. The Human Rights Council should warn the \r\nworld about the speed and mobility of the evil forces of \r\nviolent extremism and terrorism and, more importantly, \r\nwarn the supporters of that menace, including the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham, that the boomerang \r\nthey are throwing towards other nations will hit them in \r\nits return sooner rather than later.\r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n26/29 16-36139\r\nMr. Tommo Monthe (Cameroon) (spoke in French): \r\nEarlier today from this rostrum, the representative of \r\nBotswana delivered a statement on behalf of the Group \r\nof African States regarding the report of the Human \r\nRights Council (A/71/53) under consideration. I would \r\nlike to align myself with the statement he made. In \r\naddition, the President of the Human Rights Council \r\nintroduced in a comprehensive way the report before \r\nus. I would like to express my appreciation for that \r\nintroduction and for his work at the head of the Council \r\nduring the reporting period under review.\r\nIt has been 10 years since the Human Rights \r\nCouncil was established, and it actively continues its \r\nwork. Cameroon has been a member of the Council and \r\nvery actively participated in various of its activities. \r\nIt serves not just as a space, but rather as a platform \r\nconducive to dialogue for an exchange of views and \r\nof experiences; in short, for mutual enrichment and \r\npromotion in the very important and complex domain \r\nof human rights for all the peoples of the world, which \r\nis why the Universal Periodic Review mechanism \r\nis important.\r\nIn the Central African subregion, the achievement \r\nof respect for human rights and the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights is entrusted not just to \r\nthe countries of the subregion but above all to the \r\nSubregional Centre for Human Rights and Democracy \r\nin Central Africa, established by the United Nations \r\nfor human rights and the promotion of democracy in \r\nCentral Africa, which Cameroon has hosted since its \r\nestablishment in 2001.\r\nThe Centre’s goal is backstopping the work of \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Human Rights (OHCHR) in the subregion, which \r\nis done through, on the one hand, the promotion and \r\nprotection of human rights and, on the other hand, \r\nproviding support for democratization in the countries \r\nin the subregion. To that end, the Centre regularly \r\norganizes seminars and national workshops in capacity-\r\nbuilding, bringing on board various stakeholders in \r\nthe promotion and the protection of human rights. It \r\nperiodically submits a report on its activities to the \r\nAssembly and to OHCHR, which leads to collaboration \r\nbetween the two institutions. Cameroon would like to \r\nsee OHCHR give greater attention to the Centre and \r\nto increase its human and financial resources, which \r\nwould allow the Centre to better cope with its expanded \r\nprogrammes. \r\nStrongly dedicated to the fundamental values and \r\nideals in the area of the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights, Cameroon accords special attention to \r\nthe issue. Human rights are enshrined in my country’s \r\nConstitution and are formulated in its laws, policies \r\nand programmes. The principles of equality and \r\nnon-discrimination and the commitment to protect \r\nvulnerable groups are also embodied in them. So as to \r\nbetter highlight those rights and principles and ensure \r\nthat every individual benefits from the progress made \r\nin the area of human rights in Cameroon, a national \r\nself-evaluation system is in place and is complemented \r\nby the mechanisms that cooperate with treaty bodies.\r\nAt the national level, every year since 2005 \r\nCameroon has published a report on the status of \r\nhuman rights in the country. The report outlines the \r\nGovernment’s work to promote and protect human \r\nrights. It covers civil, political, economic, social and \r\ncultural rights in general, together with those of socially \r\nvulnerable groups. The report is based on cross-cutting \r\nand inclusive data and incorporates the contributions \r\nof civil society; its purpose is to assess the progress \r\nmade and the challenges that need to be addressed \r\nby all stakeholders, with a view to formulating \r\nfuture strategies.\r\nAt the international level, constructive dialogue \r\nbetween Cameroon and international mechanisms \r\nfor protecting human rights also provides a means of \r\nassessment. Cameroon regularly submits its reports to \r\nthe relevant treaty bodies of the United Nations. Since \r\nSeptember 2014, the report has included a standing \r\ninvitation to all special procedures, and in that regard \r\nvisits have been announced by the Special Rapporteur \r\non the rights of indigenous peoples and the Special \r\nRapporteur on the sale of children, child prostitution \r\nand child pornography.\r\nThanks to all the Government’s efforts, significant \r\nprogress has been made in the area of human rights in \r\nCameroon. As examples, we can underscore reduced \r\nilliteracy, improved enrolment rates, better health \r\nindicators, stable living standards and quality of life, \r\nstrengthened good governance, the inclusion of the \r\ngender aspect in public policy, a stepped-up fight against \r\nimpunity and the progressive professionalization \r\nof teaching personnel. Those efforts deserve to be \r\nconsolidated while the challenges that continue to exist \r\nin various areas should not be lost sight of. To that \r\nend, in December 2015, the Government of Cameroon \r\nadopted a national action plan for the promotion \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 27/29\r\nand protection of human rights. The plan identifies \r\nthe efforts to be undertaken and defines the roles to \r\nbe played by stakeholders, with the aim of making \r\nthe protection and promotion of human rights more \r\neffective in my country.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm our \r\nunwavering commitment to the values and ideals of \r\nhuman rights so as to promote peace throughout the \r\nworld. Accordingly, we would like to serve again on the \r\nHuman Rights Council, beginning in 2018.\r\nMs. Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank His Excellency Mr. Choi \r\nKyonglim, President of the Human Rights Council, \r\nfor his briefing and his efforts to enhance respect for \r\nand promote human rights. From its own experience \r\nin the Council, on which it served for three terms, \r\nQatar reiterates its conviction that the Council plays \r\nan important role as the best and most appropriate \r\ninternational mechanism to promote universal respect \r\nfor human rights and fundamental freedoms. Without \r\nany doubt, the new challenges arising from armed \r\nconflicts, acts of terrorism, violent extremism and \r\ndiscrimination mean that the Council must assume \r\nincreased responsibility and increasing burdens. That \r\nwill require a redoubling of efforts if the goals for which \r\nthe Council was established are to be attained and its \r\nmandate fulfilled in accordance with the principles of \r\nimpartiality, objectivity and non-selectivity.\r\nThe report (A/71/53) of the Human Rights Council \r\nincludes the resolutions of the Council on the human \r\nrights situations in the occupied Palestinian territories \r\nand in Syria. They reflect the gravity of the blatant \r\nviolations of human rights perpetrated against our \r\nPalestinian and Syrian brothers, which call for prompt \r\nand effective measures by the international community \r\ncommensurate with the seriousness of the situation \r\nfaced by civilians as a result of the lack of even the \r\nminimum level of fundamental rights. In the light of \r\nthe gravity of the situation and the direct impact on \r\nhuman rights, and in accordance with the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law, the State of Qatar \r\ncontinues to spare no effort within the international \r\ncommunity to address that dire situation, as well as to \r\nachieve peace and security in the region and the world \r\nthrough the implementation of resolutions, including \r\nthose of the Human Rights Council .\r\nQatar commends the effective role of the Human \r\nRights Council in offering technical assistance and \r\ncapacity-building to States to help them to fulfil \r\ntheir obligations in protecting and promoting human \r\nrights. In support of that role, the specific training and \r\ndocumentation mandate carried out by the Centre for \r\nSouth-West Asia and the Arab Region of the Office \r\nof the United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights, which is hosted by Qatar, deserves our praise. \r\nThe Centre contributes effectively to capacity-building \r\nand promoting human rights at the regional level. It is \r\na source of experience and references for researchers \r\nand civil society organizations concerned with \r\nhuman rights.\r\nBased on the principle of international cooperation \r\nand joint responsibility in addressing crises, promoting \r\ninternational peace and security and encouraging \r\ndevelopment at the regional and international levels, \r\nQatar has sought to achieve the objectives of the \r\nUnited Nations through its efforts aimed at the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes through the rule of law \r\nand at building peaceful societies that are capable of \r\nachieving development and promoting human rights \r\nin line with Sustainable Development Goal 16. In that \r\ncontext, my country has given particular attention to \r\nthe area of education. It has launched various initiatives \r\nto promote the achievement of the right to education in \r\nother States, especially developing States.\r\nAt the national level, the State of Qatar accords \r\ngreat importance to the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights, which are guaranteed by its Constitution \r\nas well as within Qatar’s National Vision 2030. The \r\nlatter covers the inclusion of the subject of human rights \r\nin curriculums; the promotion of the human rights of \r\nwomen, children, persons with disabilities and the \r\nelderly; combating human trafficking; improving health \r\ncare and education; and providing a dignified life for \r\nimmigrant workers. In that context, the State of Qatar \r\nhas succeeded in developing a framework in which \r\ninstitutional reform is able to guarantee the protection \r\nand promotion of human rights. It shares its experience \r\nwith other States and United Nations mechanisms and \r\npursues an open-door policy of cooperation with the \r\nspecial procedures.\r\nIn conclusion, the State of Qatar renews its \r\ncommitment to continuing its efforts to promote and \r\nprotect human rights and will continue to cooperate \r\nwith international organizations and the relevant \r\nUnited Nations mechanisms, especially the Human \r\nRights Council and its special procedures.\r\nA/71/PV.41 04/11/2016\r\n28/29 16-36139\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind \r\nmembers that, in accordance with decision 34/401, \r\nstatements in exercise of the right of reply are limited \r\nto 10 minutes for the first statement and to five minutes \r\nfor the second and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Goltyaev (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I would like to exercise the right of reply to \r\nrespond to the statements made by the representatives \r\nof Georgia and Ukraine.\r\nWith regard to the statement made by the \r\nrepresentative of Georgia, we would like to call upon \r\nthat country to finally recognize the new political \r\nreality, namely, the existence of two independent \r\nStates: South Ossetia and Abkhazia. In that regard, any \r\nmatters, including those concerning human rights, have \r\nto be addressed directly to the Governments of those \r\ncountries using existing international formats, first and \r\nforemost the Geneva international discussions.\r\nTurning to the statement made by the representative \r\nof Ukraine, I would like to recall that Crimea and \r\nSevastopol became part of the Russian Federation as \r\na result of the referendum, which was conducted in \r\nfull accordance with international law. The people of \r\nCrimea and Sevastopol have realized their right to self-\r\ndetermination, which is guaranteed by the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and by international conventions \r\non human rights, as well as by the Declaration on the \r\nPrinciples of International Law concerning Friendly \r\nRelations and Cooperation among States in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, of 1970.\r\nWe would like to repeat that the Constitution of the \r\nRussian Federation and the international agreements of \r\nwhich the Russian Federation is a signatory, including \r\nthose pertaining to human rights, apply in Crimea \r\nand Sevastopol. The people who live in the Republic \r\nof Crimea and the city of Sevastopol, like any other \r\nindividuals who come under the jurisdiction of the \r\nRussian Federation, enjoy all human rights that are \r\nlegally guaranteed by Russia. If they have grounds for \r\nbelieving that their rights or freedoms have in some \r\nway been violated, the competent Russian authorities, \r\nacting in accordance with their mandates, respond to \r\nany information regarding possible violations of human \r\nrights, including by conducting investigations and \r\ninstituting legal proceedings, as necessary.\r\nMr. Ri Song Chol (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): My delegation would like to exercise its \r\nright of reply to respond to the statements made by the \r\nobserver of the European Union (EU) and some of its \r\nmember countries.\r\nMy delegation totally resents the groundless \r\nallegations made by the EU and those EU countries. The \r\nEU is the main violator of human rights. EU countries \r\nhave deplorable human rights violation records: the \r\nrefugee crisis, which involves the ill-treatment and \r\nexploitation of migrants and refugees; Islamophobia; \r\nincreasing unemployment; and sexual assault. \r\nRefugees in European countries are far from protected \r\nand are subjected to humiliation, expulsion and even \r\nto violence, a situation that causes strong protest and \r\nconcern within the international community.\r\n First and foremost, the EU and other Western \r\ncountries should attend to their own human rights \r\nsituations. The specific procedures of some countries \r\nare obvious examples of politicization, selectivity and \r\ndouble standards and interference into other countries’ \r\nsovereignty. Such procedures should be ended in the \r\ninterests of facilitating constructive dialogue and \r\ncooperation in the handling of human rights issues.\r\nMs. Kupradze (Georgia): I take the f loor to exercise \r\nour right of reply to respond to the comments just made \r\nby the representative of the Russian Federation.\r\nFirst of all, it is surprising that the delegation of \r\nthe Russian Federation saw fit to exercise its right \r\nof reply, given the fact that in our statement we did \r\nnot mention Russia. However, since the status of the \r\noccupied Georgian regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali \r\nwas mentioned, let me once again, in response to \r\nthe misleading comments made by the Russian \r\ndelegation, state that Russia is an occupying Power \r\nin the Georgian regions of Abkhazia and Tskhinvali. \r\nIt still maintains thousands of troops and military \r\nbases in those territories, where human rights are \r\nsystematically violated.\r\n Let me once again reiterate, with regard to the \r\ncomments made concerning the Geneva international \r\ndiscussions, that the conflict has only two parties: \r\none of them is Georgia, a country that is defending \r\nits sovereignty and territorial integrity, and the other \r\nparty is the Russian Federation, which consistently \r\n04/11/2016 A/71/PV.41\r\n16-36139 29/29\r\nand continuously violates our country. We discussed \r\nthose issues at the Geneva international discussions \r\nwith the other party to the conflict. At the same time, \r\nlet me reiterate that all this recalls the urgent need for \r\ninternational human rights mechanisms to access and \r\nmonitor the occupied regions. Given the current status \r\nof the Russian Federation in that region as as occupying \r\nPower, its statements have no credibility whatsoever.\r\nMs. Horbachova (Ukraine): I would like to \r\nexercise my right of reply to respond to the statement \r\nand comments just made by the representative of the \r\nRussian Federation. I will be very brief.\r\nI would like to once again stress that the conflict in \r\ncertain areas of the Donbas, including the Donetsk and \r\nLuhansk regions, was caused by the Russian aggression \r\nagainst Ukraine, which started with the occupation of \r\nthe Autonomous Republic of Crimea. Were it not for the \r\nconstant and sustained f low of weapons and fighters, \r\nas well as the presence of regular Russian troops on \r\nUkrainian territory, the lives and well-being of millions \r\nof Ukrainian citizens would not have been adversely \r\naffected.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 63.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.10 p.m.\r\n"
