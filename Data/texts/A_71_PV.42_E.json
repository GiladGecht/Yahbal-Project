"United Nations A/71/PV.42\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n42nd plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 7 November 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 122\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council\r\nThe President: The item before us today on Security \r\nCouncil reform goes to the very heart of the purposes \r\nand principles of the Organization. Since the United \r\nNations was founded 71 years ago the world has changed \r\ndramatically, with population growth, economic and \r\ntechnological advancements and progress in human \r\nrights, the rising interconnectivity and mobility of \r\npeople, the shifting global dynamics, climate change, \r\nenvironmental degradation, the growing frequency \r\nand severity of natural disasters, and the sheer nature \r\nand complexity of global security challenges that are \r\nincreasing greatly.\r\nIndeed, the number of States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations has quadrupled over those years. The \r\nrise of terrorism and violent extremism, the expansion \r\nof asymmetrical warfare, the risk of weapons of \r\nmass destruction falling into the hands of non-State \r\nactors, and the illegal proliferation of small arms and \r\nlight weapons in both inter- and intra-State conflicts \r\nare all threatening international peace and security \r\nand challenging the capacity of the United Nations \r\nto respond.\r\nAs we meet, the world is facing the worst \r\nhumanitarian refugee crisis since the Second World \r\nWar, and the United Nations is responding to the highest \r\nnumber of simultaneous security and humanitarian \r\ncrises in its history. It has become a well-founded \r\npriority for all Member States to ensure that the \r\nSecurity Council, as the organ of the United Nations \r\nwith primary responsibility for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security, is representative, \r\nresponsive, effective and efficient.\r\nInstitutional reform of the United Nations is not \r\nonly possible, but has already taken place in recent \r\ntimes. We have also seen greater coordination between \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council, not \r\nleast during this year’s appointment process for the \r\nnew Secretary-General. I applaud those developments. \r\nHowever, it remains clear that much work remains to be \r\ndone. Advancing Security Council reform will remain \r\na key priority for the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session as we look to take forward discussions, \r\nin accordance with the relevant General Assembly \r\nresolutions and decisions.\r\nDuring the seventieth session, the General \r\nAssembly decided at its last plenary meeting on this \r\nitem (see A/70/PV.113) to immediately continue the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform in informal plenary meetings during the \r\nseventy-first session. To facilitate those negotiations, \r\nI have appointed Ambassador Mohamed Khiari of \r\nTunisia and Ambassador Ion Jinga of Romania as \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations. I am \r\nconfident that they will steer those negotiations with \r\ngreat skill. I thank them for taking on that critical role \r\non behalf of the Assembly, and I call upon all Member \r\nStates to extend their full support and cooperation to \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to warmly thank Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas of Luxembourg for her work as Chair of the \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform during the \r\nseventieth session.\r\nAs we embark on the next phase of this Member \r\nState-driven process, we should all acknowledge \r\nthat meaningful progress will require genuine and \r\nopen dialogue, bringing and receiving new ideas and \r\nworking together to find areas of agreement. While \r\nthe sensitivity and difficulty of those issues is well \r\nunderstood, in order for reform to occur Member States \r\nwill need to engage with greater f lexibility in a process \r\nleading to substantive results. I will remain engaged \r\nin the process throughout the seventy-first session and \r\nwill provide all necessary support to the co-Chairs. \r\nMy door is always open to any delegation wishing to \r\ndiscuss this matter.\r\nIf the United Nations is to be responsive and meet \r\nthe challenges of our times, reform of the Security \r\nCouncil is essential. We must ensure that the Council \r\nref lects the realities of the twenty-first century and that \r\nit is able to deliver on the purposes and principles and \r\npromise of the Charter of the United Nations. Saving \r\nsucceeding generations from the scourge of war is an \r\nextraordinary responsibility shared by us all. It is a \r\nresponsibility that we must not shirk and will not shirk.\r\nMr. Sumah (Sierra Leone): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the States members of \r\nthe African Union. I thank you profusely, Mr. President, \r\nfor your very thoughtful and timely decision to convene \r\ntoday’s plenary debate on agenda item 122, “Question \r\nof equitable representation on and increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council and other matters \r\nrelated to the Security Council”. We take note of and \r\nthank you for your remarks.\r\nLet me congratulate Mr. Ion Jinga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, and Mr. Mohamed \r\nKhiari, Permanent Representative of Tunisia, on their \r\nappointment as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We also \r\nexpress our support and readiness to work with them in \r\nbuilding on the gains made so far in the reform process.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to reiterate the \r\ncommitment of Africa to this very important issue and \r\nlook forward to working with you, Sir, and engaging \r\nthe membership in building a consensus that is in \r\nconcurrence with decision 62/557 and favourable to the \r\ncommon African position, succinctly articulated in the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and Sirte Declaration.\r\nDuring the seventieth session, we held myriad \r\ndebates on all of the five negotiable clusters, which, \r\nregrettably, led to the production of an element paper \r\nthat focuses on only two of the five key issues of the \r\nSecurity Council reform, namely, the relationship \r\nbetween the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly, and the size of an enlarged Security Council \r\nand its working methods. At this juncture, I would like \r\nto reiterate that a document that addresses only two of \r\nthe five key issues of Security Council reform cannot \r\nbe a true basis for informing the future work of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, nor can it adequately \r\nmaintain the momentum we all seek to enable us to \r\nmove towards text-based negotiations. From those \r\nexchanges, it is apparent that many Member States \r\nbelieve that the Security Council should be reformed \r\nto represent today’s global political realities, which are \r\nprofoundly different from those that were extant at the \r\ninception of the United Nations 70 years ago.\r\nIt is clear that a considerable number of Member \r\nStates support comprehensive reform, in accordance \r\nwith decision 62/557. In this regard, I wish to reiterate \r\nthat despite our tremendous differences on how to \r\nguide and move the reform process forward, Africa \r\nsupports a comprehensive reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in a membership-driven manner and is against \r\nany piecemeal reform. As we have often stated, the \r\nCommon African Position emphasizes that reform of \r\nthe United Nations system should be all-inclusive and \r\nencompass all components. The reform process should \r\nnot become an endless cycle — which undoubtedly \r\nruns counter to an early reform of the type set forth by \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration. At \r\nthis stage, we must endeavour to reach an agreement on \r\nhow to move forward with the positions and proposals \r\nof Member States that were circulated on 31 July 2015, \r\nduring the Assembly’s sixty-ninth session, which could \r\nbe a good starting point towards the harmonization \r\nof positions and the eventual commencement of text-\r\nbased negotiations.\r\nDuring the general debate at the General Assembly \r\nthis year, several Heads of State and Government \r\naffirmed the need to reform the Security Council \r\nin order to make it broadly representative, efficient \r\nand transparent, and thereby further enhance its \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 3/28\r\neffectiveness and legitimacy in the implementation \r\nof its decisions. Similarly, more and more countries \r\nare questioning the legitimacy and credibility of the \r\nSecurity Council, in which they have no effective \r\nvoice or equitable regional representation. It is now \r\ntime for us to walk the talk with a view to reaching an \r\nagreement on a reform model that takes the core values \r\nof the United Nations into consideration.\r\nOn two occasions, by letters dated 23 December \r\n2009 and 22 April 2015, we submitted our position on all \r\nfive clusters with respect to the previous tiers. Africa’s \r\nposition on Security Council reform is well known. \r\nSpecifically, it is the only region that is not represented \r\nin the permanent category while being, at the same \r\ntime, underrepresented in the Council’s non-permanent \r\ncategory. As a continent, Africa continues to demand \r\nthe redress of this historical injustice.\r\nGiven the changing international landscape, we \r\nbelieve that the obsolete composition and the absence \r\nof adequate representation of an entire region is a \r\ndeficiency that risks compromising the legitimacy \r\nof the Council’s decisions. In this vein, we call for \r\nan expansion of the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of the Security Council, as well as the \r\ngranting to the new members of all of the prerogatives \r\nand privileges of permanent members, including the \r\nright of the veto — if it continues to exist. The need \r\nto correct the grossly unjust scenario suffered by a \r\ncontinent comprising 54 countries and accounting for \r\n70 per cent of the work of the Council is fundamental \r\nand long overdue.\r\nIn pursuit of that objective, we remain committed \r\nto building alliances with diverse interest groups and \r\nMember States on the basis of the Common African \r\nPosition, with a view to bringing about the reform of \r\nthe Security Council. It must also be borne in mind \r\nthat, in the business of maintaining international \r\npeace and collective global security and contributing \r\nto peacekeeping operations, Africa, like the rest of the \r\nworld, continues to pay the ultimate price — which \r\nis by no means quantifiable in material or monetary \r\nterms. Africa’s demand for at least two permanent seats \r\nand two additional non-permanent seats is a matter of \r\ncommon justice. Africa has the right to have an equal \r\nsay in decision-making on issues of international peace \r\nand security, and in particular those that concern our \r\ncontinent, which is why we continue to demand our \r\nrightful place in the maintenance of peace and security.\r\nIt is common knowledge that support for the \r\nCommon African Position has gained momentum and \r\ncontinues to receive large support in the deliberations \r\non Africa’s legitimate claim. Since this claim is without \r\ncontroversy, it has been recognized and acknowledged \r\nas legitimate by the general membership. By virtue of \r\nthat, the demand ought to be redressed without further \r\ndelay, which would mean no longer perpetuating a more \r\nthan 50-year-old injustice, which has in effect denied \r\nthe region its dignity and rightful place in a major \r\ndecision-making organ of the Organization.\r\nOn behalf of the African Union member States, \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to thank the \r\ndelegations and interest groups that continue to \r\nsupport the Common African Position. As we have \r\noften reiterated, Africa stands ready to work with \r\nall delegations and interest groups for the purpose of \r\nachieving a solution that can garner the widest possible \r\npolitical acceptance. For Africa, as represented by \r\nthe Committee of Ten on Security Council Reform, \r\nthe necessary political will for reform without \r\nfurther procrastination is present and propelled by a \r\ncommon determination.\r\nIn conclusion, we hope that under your charismatic \r\nleadership, Sir, the session will build on the progress \r\nmade thus far and increase the momentum for a more \r\nfrank and interactive debate that will aggregate the \r\npolitical will present across the member States of the \r\nAfrican Union, which will, we trust, lead to the early \r\nreform of the Security Council, in accordance with the \r\nvision of our world leaders, expressed in unanimity at \r\nthe 2005 World Summit. In this regard, we look forward \r\nto further engaging the entire membership and the \r\nChairs in good faith and mutual trust. We will remain \r\nopen to working together with any other initiative \r\nthat will take into account the level of momentum and \r\nsupport the Common African Position has gained thus \r\nfar. We also look forward to more constructive and \r\nforward-looking intergovernmental negotiations during \r\nthe seventy-first session and urge all Member States to \r\nwork together towards moving the reform process to \r\ntext-based negotiations.\r\nMs. Rambally (Saint Lucia): It remains my great \r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of the L.69 \r\ngroup of developing countries, indeed a diverse group \r\nof more than 42 countries from the developing world, \r\nfrom Africa, Latin America and the Caribbean and \r\nAsia and the Pacific, which continue to be united \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n4/28 16-36369\r\nby a common cause, namely, achieving lasting and \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nMr. President, we would like to begin by \r\ncongratulating you on commencing this process in \r\nearnest, with your letter of 26 October 2016. We welcome \r\nthe appointment as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations of our colleagues the Ambassador \r\nand Permanent Representative of Romania and the \r\nAmbassador and Permanent Representative of Tunisia. \r\nI wish them every success during their tenure in this \r\ntask that is so critical for all of us who compose the \r\nUnited Nations system. I wish to assure the co-Chairs of \r\nour Group’s full support and cooperation in the period \r\nahead. Our Group also wishes to place on record our \r\nappreciation of the contribution made by Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas, the former Permanent Representative \r\nof Luxembourg, as Chair of the negotiations at the \r\nseventieth session.\r\nMr. President, in your letter dated 26 October 2016, \r\nyou encouraged Member States to continue moving \r\nthe process forward through negotiations, building on \r\nthe progress made at the sixty-ninth and seventieth \r\nsessions and the framework document and its annex, \r\ndated 31 July 2015. It will therefore be important, in the \r\nnext round of intergovernmental negotiations, that we \r\ncommence the process with negotiations and build on \r\nthe texts agreed by consensus — an absolutely essential \r\nstep for moving forward. The L.69 group of developing \r\ncountries is now eager to engage and would like to \r\nwork with you and the co-Chairs to steer this process \r\ntowards text-based negotiations for the meaningful, \r\nno longer early but absolutely necessary reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nOur group is bound by the firm conviction that \r\nexpansion in both the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories of membership of the Security Council is \r\nimperative to better reflect contemporary world realities \r\nand to achieve a more accountable, representative, \r\ntransparent and, above all else, a more relevant Security \r\nCouncil. With the complex challenges before our world \r\ntoday, that need is both major and urgent. At the most \r\nrecent session of the intergovernmental negotiations, it \r\nwas clear to us all that there were convergences among \r\nthe positions of Member States on all five pillars of \r\nSecurity Council reform. As the elements paper of the \r\nChair of the intergovernmental negotiations summed \r\nup convergences in only two of the five reform pillars, \r\nhowever, the task remained unfinished. We would \r\nurge the co-Chairs to finish the task by summing up \r\nthe convergences among positions of Member States \r\nin all five pillars of Security Council reform, as was \r\nreflected in the statements made by Member States \r\nduring the seventieth session. I would like to add that, \r\nin completing that important task, the co-Chairs can \r\nrely on the support of our Group from beginning to end.\r\nWe very much welcome the newly formed Group of \r\nFriends on Security Council Reform, of which the L.69 \r\ngroup is a member. The Group of Friends will work \r\ntogether with the aim of accelerating the negotiations \r\nprocess for meaningful reform of the Council based \r\non three principles: early or urgent reforms, text-based \r\nnegotiations and the expansion of both categories of \r\nmembership. We welcome other Member States that \r\nwant to join the Group on the basis of its principles.\r\nI would like to reiterate our Group’s support for \r\nyour efforts, Mr. President, and look forward to your \r\ncontinued engagement in the process throughout \r\nthe session.\r\nMr. Cardi (Italy): Mr. President, on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus (UfC) group, I wish to thank \r\nyou for convening the annual debate on Security \r\nCouncil reform, and to express our appreciation for \r\nyour engagement in the reform process with a new \r\nand fresh approach. The first concrete sign of that \r\nengagement was your decision to appoint Ambassadors \r\nIon Jinga and Khaled Khiari as co-facilitators of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We warmly welcome \r\nthem in their new capacities, and wish to immediately \r\noffer our full cooperation and support in their new \r\npivotal responsibilities.\r\nThe appointment of two co-facilitators attests to \r\nthe need to explore alternative approaches, as emerged \r\nduring the seventieth session of the General Assembly. \r\nIn particular, the search for broad convergences among \r\nMember States, pursued during the previous session \r\nunder the stewardship of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nexemplifies the consensual path we believe is key to \r\nachieving concrete results. Hence, for this session of \r\nwork, the UfC reiterates the need to stay on this path \r\nand focus on the real convergences in the remaining \r\nclusters of the reform process. Our work must be done \r\nin a true spirit of compromise while putting aside what \r\nhas hampered the achievement of a common goal for \r\ntoo many years.\r\nA new Security Council, grounded in a democratic \r\nand inclusive vision, remains the political priority \r\nof the Uniting for Consensus group. That inclusive \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 5/28\r\nvision goes hand in hand with the conviction that the \r\nreform cannot but be consensual. We are certain that \r\nthe reform of the United Nations body responsible for \r\ninternational peace and security requires the support of \r\nthe entire United Nations membership. After all, it was \r\nalong that very same path that we were able to change \r\nthe method of selection and appointment of the head \r\nof the Organization, proving that consensual reform \r\nis possible.\r\nI think we are all aware of the frustration felt \r\nby Member States owing to the lack of progress in a \r\nreform that has been discussed for over 20 years. The \r\nUniting for Consensus countries, as well as influential \r\nexternal observers, have stated that the evidence clearly \r\npoints to the only true obstacle to reform: the call for \r\nan increase in the number of permanent members of \r\nthe Council — with the veto, without the veto or with a \r\nsuspended veto. In our view, this is the only reason for \r\nthe stalemate we have been experiencing in the reform \r\nprocess. In our view, no Member State should be scared \r\nof facing elections — certainly not those who own all \r\nthe means of succeeding and contribute substantially \r\nto the work of the Council. That is why we invite all \r\nMember States to genuinely commit to reforming the \r\nCouncil, together with Uniting for Consensus countries, \r\nin a manner that takes into account all views.\r\nThere is no Member State in the Hall today that \r\ndisagrees with the idea of expanding the number of \r\nnon-permanent seats on the Council. No Member State \r\nis against such an increase, which will favour countries \r\nbelonging to the underrepresented regions of the world. \r\nIn contrast, a very significant and growing number of \r\nMember States has opposed an expanded use of the veto \r\nand, rather, supports its limitation. In our view, that is \r\nthe common ground on which to base the solution that \r\nwill finally unlock the reform process. We owe this \r\nattempt to those who believe in a renewed Organization \r\nand therefore in a modern Security Council that is more \r\nrepresentative, democratic, accountable, transparent \r\nand effective.\r\nA more representative and democratic Security \r\nCouncil means offering an equal opportunity to all \r\nMember States to serve periodically on the Council \r\nitself, as well as enhancing the right of the membership \r\nto decide and adapt the Council’s composition on a \r\nregular basis. In line with this perspective, the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus countries are committed to a reform that \r\nincreases, rather than reduces, the democratic nature \r\nof the Council — a reform that is centred on elective, \r\nnon-permanent seats in the belief that, in the twenty-\r\nfirst century, this is the only formula that can have \r\na positive and credible impact on the legitimacy and \r\nauthority of the United Nations body responsible for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nI think that there is no need to explain how such \r\na reform would also have a tremendous impact on \r\nregional representation, by fostering a wider and fairer \r\nrotation within regional groups. In addition, it will \r\ncreate a favourable ratio of non-permanent members \r\nto permanent members in the Security Council. Such \r\na change will improve the Council’s working methods, \r\naugment its decision-making capacity, present a \r\ndemocratic challenge to the veto and improve the \r\noverall relationship between the Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nAny decision in the near future on the Security \r\nCouncil reform process will require true f lexibility and \r\nwillingness to compromise. Over the years, the UfC \r\nGroup has tried to capture those new elements emerging \r\nfrom discussions in the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nthat could bridge the gap with other negotiating groups. \r\nIn that perspective, the increasing support for what is \r\nknown as the intermediate approach represents a new \r\nfactor in the search for a compromise solution and \r\ndeserves our full attention.\r\nThe UfC countries are proposing that, in addition to \r\nan expansion of non-permanent seats, a new category of \r\nlonger-term, non-permanent seats, with the possibility \r\nof an immediate re-election, should be established. \r\nThose new seats would not be reserved for a selected \r\ngroup of countries; all Member States willing to make \r\na larger contribution to the work of the Council would \r\nhave the right to contest elections for a longer-term seat \r\non the basis of equitable geographical distribution and a \r\nfair system of rotation. Periodic elections would ensure \r\nthe accountability of the longer-term members.\r\nThe Uniting for Consensus group stands ready to \r\ncooperate with you, Mr. President, the new co-Chairs \r\nand the whole membership for advancing this process \r\nin the firm conviction that Security Council reform is \r\npossible in the short term. In keeping with decision \r\n62/557, we shall continue to work for a comprehensive \r\nreform that can gather the widest consensus. The UfC \r\nGroup can be counted on to redouble its efforts in \r\nthat direction.\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I have the \r\nhonour to deliver this statement on behalf of the Group \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n6/28 16-36369\r\nof Arab States. At the outset, I would like to express the \r\nsupport of the Arab Group for your work, Mr. President, \r\nparticularly in leading these negotiations. We welcome \r\nthe appointment of Mohamed Khaled Khiari of \r\nTunisia and Ion Jinga of Romania as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process.\r\nSecurity Council reform to ensure equitable \r\nrepresentation is a key aspect of overall United Nations \r\nreform. It is all the more important as the world has \r\nbeen undergoing rapid change, which challenges us \r\nto step up efforts to revitalize the role of the Security \r\nCouncil with a view to making it more effective and \r\nenabling it to meet current challenges, while respecting \r\nthe principles of transparency, neutrality and credibility.\r\nThe debate on enlarging the Security Council and its \r\nworking methods was started some considerable time \r\nago. There are differing positions on the subject. We \r\nmust once again turn our attention to this very important \r\nissue and seek consensual solutions.\r\nThe world has changed significantly since the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations in 1945. It is \r\ntherefore high time to embark on this reform. In that \r\ncontext, the Arab Group stresses that views on the \r\nquestion of the enlargement of the Security Council \r\nshould be expressed in intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nin accordance with decision 62/557. The Arab Group \r\nbelieves that when the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nare relaunched at the current session, all the proposals \r\nput forward by members of the Arab Group should be \r\non the table. This is the basis that should guide the \r\nco-Chairs’ work, so that we can move forward on the \r\nquestion of Security Council reform.\r\nThe Arab Group reaffirms its strong position, \r\nwhich is founded on the principle of consensus among \r\nMember States. We are facing numerous challenges and \r\ndisagreements on the issue of the excessive use of the \r\nveto by the five permanent Council members, which \r\nundermines the credibility of the Council’s decisions \r\nand hinders its efficiency in maintaining international \r\npeace and security. The use of the veto by the five \r\npermanent members in recent years has allowed those \r\nmembers to defend their own narrow national interests \r\nand those of their allies. Despite the fact that the veto \r\nis being used less and less, it is still an efficient means \r\nfor certain Governments to absolve themselves of \r\nresponsibility. Over the past 20 years, the veto has been \r\nused 27 times, 15 of them to protect the activities of the \r\nIsraeli authorities in the occupied Arab territories.\r\nIt is necessary to reform the working methods \r\nof the Security Council in order to make them more \r\ntransparent and more efficient. We must also revise the \r\nrules of procedure of the Security Council and replace \r\nthe provisional rules of procedure of many years’ \r\nduration. It is also important to increase the number of \r\npublic meetings of the Security Council and the number \r\nof meetings in general. We must allow non-members of \r\nthe Security Council to participate. It is also necessary \r\nto decrease the number of closed meetings and informal \r\nconsultations. It is imperative that the Security Council \r\ninvolve the States that will be affected by the decisions \r\nit takes when it considers agenda items that are of \r\nrelevance to those States. The League of Arab States \r\ncalls on the subsidiary bodies of the Security Council \r\nto inform all Member States of their activities. The \r\nposition of the members of the Arab Group is that there \r\nshould be a permanent seat and a non-permanent seat \r\nfor Arab States on the Security Council.\r\nTo conclude, we commit to participating in the next \r\nround of intergovernmental negotiations with a view \r\nto reaching a consensus decision that will allow us to \r\ncomprehensively reform the Security Council.\r\nMr. Braun (Germany): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Group of Four (G-4): Brazil, India, \r\nJapan and Germany.\r\nTo begin, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, \r\nfor personally reaching out to groups and Member States \r\nin the run-up to the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nat the seventy-first session of the General Assembly. \r\nLet me join other previous speakers in congratulating \r\nour colleagues, Ion Jinga and Khaled Khiari, whom \r\nyou have appointed to chair the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. I wish them great success in their critical \r\ntask and pledge our support to their work and to yours.\r\nLet me share three thoughts with everyone \r\nassembled here today.\r\nFirst, reform is urgent. As far back as 2005, our \r\nHeads of State and Government underscored the need \r\nfor an early reform of the Security Council, yet little to \r\nno real progress has been achieved since then. Here in \r\nNew York, we painfully observe the shortcomings of the \r\nSecurity Council in its outdated composition, reflecting \r\nthe year 1945, and its inadequate working methods. The \r\nSecurity Council must be rendered fit for purpose in \r\norder to be able to face the global challenges of peace \r\nand security in the twenty-first century. Unfortunately, \r\nand painfully, those challenges remain before us in \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 7/28\r\ntheir cruel brutality every day. Fit for purpose means \r\nthat all regions, including the developing world, must \r\nbe adequately represented in order to ensure legitimacy \r\nand effectiveness. Hence, I have no doubt that all of \r\nus here agree on the importance of the assignment on \r\nreform we have been given and that an actual negotiation \r\nand a decision-making process are due now.\r\nSecondly, there are sufficient grounds for real \r\nnegotiations. Some perpetuate the myth that the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations are opposing one \r\nanother in irreconcilable positions on reform. That is \r\nfalse. The most recent session of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations amplified what has been visible for years \r\nalready. There exist real convergences among the \r\npositions of Member States and convergences in all five \r\npillars of Security Council reform. The elements paper \r\nissued at the end of the seventieth session summed up \r\nconvergences in only two out of five reform pillars. \r\nHowever, there were convergences even in the most \r\ndisputed fields. To cite just one example, a large and \r\ngrowing majority of Member States supports expansion \r\nof the Council in both categories of seats. Earlier on, \r\nthat fact had been confirmed in documents by the \r\nChairs of the intergovernmental negotiations in 2009, \r\n2012 and 2014. That and all the other convergences \r\nshould be the guide for our current negotiation process.\r\nThirdly, there is a legitimate basis for negotiations. \r\nDuring the sixty-ninth session, Member States were \r\ninvited to record their positions on all five pillars of \r\nSecurity Council reform in writing. That led to the \r\ncompilation and adoption by consensus of one of the \r\nmost democratically legitimate documents on Security \r\nCouncil reform in existence — the framework document \r\nand its annex, as circulated by the then President of \r\nthe General Assembly in his letter dated 31 July 2015. \r\nThat is the most comprehensive and legitimate basis for \r\nnegotiations that we have to date. By the way, for those \r\nwho have not contributed to the document so far, to my \r\nknowledge the invitation remains open to come and \r\nhave their positions included as well.\r\nThose facts lead to a profound conclusion: \r\nreal, text-based negotiations must begin now, in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations at the seventy-first \r\nsession. We therefore request that the co-Chairs use the \r\ntext of the existing framework document and its annex \r\nas a basis for negotiations in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. The aim should be to condense that text \r\nstep by step and to create a workable document in the \r\ncourse of this session of the Assembly.\r\nIn that regard, we very much welcome the newly \r\nfounded Group of Friends on Security Council \r\nReform. Representatives at the ministerial or senior \r\nofficial level of Member States belonging to reform-\r\noriented groups — including the Committee of Ten, the \r\nCaribbean Community, the G-4 countries and the L.69 \r\ngroup — and representatives of Nordic and Eastern \r\nEuropean countries, as well as France and the United \r\nKingdom, all met in New York on 21 September in the \r\nmargins of the General Assembly to discuss the issue \r\nof Security Council reform. They underlined that 11 \r\nyears after the 2005 World Summit, when all Heads \r\nof State and Government unanimously called for an \r\nearly reform of the Security Council, it was high time \r\nto finally move forward. They agreed to work together \r\nwith the aim of accelerating the negotiating process \r\nfor a meaningful reform of the Council. The Group of \r\nFriends is based on three principles: early reform, text-\r\nbased negotiations and expansion in both categories of \r\nseats. They welcome other Member States joining the \r\ngroup based on those goals.\r\nIn conclusion, in the light of those principles, we \r\nstrive for nothing less than meaningful text-based \r\nnegotiations in the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nWe call on you, Mr. President, to let your leadership \r\nreflect that level of ambition among the vast majority \r\nof Member States. Last but not least, we count on the \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations to aim \r\nhigh, to put our long-standing requests into action and \r\nto start the negotiations now.\r\nMr. Sauer (Finland): I am speaking on behalf of \r\nthe Nordic countries — Denmark, Iceland, Norway, \r\nSweden and my own country, Finland. The Nordic \r\ncountries welcome the appointment of Ambassador \r\nIon Jinga, Permanent Representative of Romania, and \r\nAmbassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia, as co-Chairs of this round \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We would like to express our support for \r\ntheir work.\r\nOur common objective should be to make the \r\nSecurity Council more representative, transparent, \r\neffective and accountable than is currently the case. An \r\nenlarged Security Council would need to better reflect \r\ntoday’s world, in particular with regard to Africa. As \r\nwe discuss the size and composition of the Council, \r\nwe also need to continue to discuss how the Council’s \r\nworking methods can be continuously improved in order \r\nto ensure efficiency, transparency and accountability.\r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n8/28 16-36369\r\nThe last two rounds of negotiations, under the \r\nable leadership of Ambassadors Rattray and Lucas, \r\nshowed a high degree of engagement and an increasing \r\nconvergence on key issues. We were encouraged by \r\nthe positive atmosphere in which the last round of \r\nnegotiations took place. We are therefore optimistic \r\nthat it is possible to move ahead towards meaningful \r\nreform of the Council by building on the progress that \r\nhas been made during the past two years. That will \r\nrequire the continued will of Member States to engage \r\nin the process, to be open to new ideas and to be willing \r\nto listen to the views of others. Only then can we find \r\nthe necessary common ground to move forward. We \r\ntrust that the recently established Group of Friends on \r\nSecurity Council Reform, which was also mentioned by \r\nthe representatives of Saint Lucia and Germany a few \r\nminutes ago, will have a positive impact on those efforts.\r\nMr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium) (spoke in \r\nFrench): Mr. President, I thank you for convening this \r\nmeeting. I have the honour of speaking on behalf of \r\nBelgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is important for \r\nthe credibility and smooth functioning of the United \r\nNations. Reform of the Council is necessary if we are to \r\nmake it more representative, effective and transparent. \r\nThat is an objective that we hold dear and is shared by \r\nall. I will not repeat the positions of our three countries \r\non the specifics of the reform, as they are well known \r\nand reflected in President Kutesa’s letter of 31 July \r\n2015 and in the elements of the convergence paper \r\ndistributed on 12 July by Mr. Lykketoft, President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventieth session.\r\nI will confine myself to stressing the importance \r\nof increasing the representativeness of the Council \r\nby enabling African countries to take their rightful \r\nplace on the Council and by ensuring the effective \r\nparticipation of small and medium-sized States in \r\nthe work of an enlarged Council. Given the growing \r\ninclusion of regional organizations in the work of \r\nthe Security Council, we also believe that we should \r\npay more attention to that aspect in our Council \r\nreform considerations.\r\nOver recent years, progress has been made. We \r\nmust keep that momentum going. Allow me to reiterate \r\nour special thanks to Ambassador Sylvie Lucas for the \r\nimpartial, effective and transparent manner in which \r\nshe presided over the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council during the seventieth \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We hope that the \r\nsubstantial elements of convergence that were identified \r\nat that session will be useful in future negotiations and \r\nthat they will be a source of inspiration for the further \r\nnarrowing of gaps in our positions, with a view to the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the Security Council.\r\nI extend our congratulations to the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Tunisia and Romania, Ambassadors \r\nKhaled Khiari and Ion Jinga, on being appointed to \r\nchair the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform. We must all contribute if we are to \r\nmake headway. We are convinced that if the Member \r\nStates engage and negotiate in good faith, the Security \r\nCouncil can be reformed. For our part, our three \r\ncountries will continue to participate actively in the \r\nnegotiations. The co-Chairs and you, Sir, can count on \r\nour full support.\r\nMs. Bird (Australia): At the outset, let me join \r\nothers in welcoming your appointment of the co-Chairs \r\nfor the session, Ambassador Jinga and Ambassador \r\nKhiari. I express Australia’s sincere appreciation to \r\nAmbassador Lucas of Luxembourg for her stewardship \r\nas Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations over the \r\npast year and to Ambassador Rattray, her predecessor \r\nthe year before.\r\nAlthough the past two sessions did not deliver on the \r\nscale and pace that we had hoped for, they nonetheless \r\ntook important steps towards a long-overdue reform \r\nof the Security Council. In particular, the paper on \r\nelements of convergence developed over the past year \r\nprovides a sound starting point for the current session.\r\nAustralia’s position on Security Council reform \r\nis well known. We believe that the Council needs to \r\nbetter reflect contemporary geopolitical realities, and \r\nthat means more representation for Asia, Africa and \r\nLatin America. However, we have also been clear that \r\nenlargement must not reduce the ability of the Council \r\nto act swiftly and decisively. Accordingly, expansion \r\nmust take place within limits and must be accompanied \r\nby improvements in the Council’s working methods.\r\nOn working methods, we have long advocated \r\nfor greater transparency in the Council’s work, better \r\ncoordination between the Council and the General \r\nAssembly, more analytical reporting, and better \r\nconsultation with troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries. We are pleased that the elements of \r\nconvergence identify a range of measures that address \r\nthose issues. Through those measures, Member States \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 9/28\r\nhave the opportunity to take practical steps that can \r\nimmediately improve the Council’s working methods. \r\nWe urge Member States to move forward with their \r\nimplementation without delay. Doing so would build \r\nconfidence that the process can and will deliver on \r\nmuch-needed reform, and, in turn, that momentum will \r\nserve us well in addressing the more challenging issues \r\non our agenda, such as the question of the veto.\r\nOur discussion here takes place at a time when \r\nthe Security Council is more divided than ever. The \r\ngrowing catastrophe in Syria, its unacceptable human \r\ncost and the Council’s inability to act must imbue \r\nus with fresh resolve. We urge all Member States, \r\nand especially the five permament members of the \r\nSecurity Council, to commit to the Accountability, \r\nCoherence, Transparency Group’s code of conduct and \r\nthe complementary French-Mexican declaration, which \r\ncall for restraint on the use of the veto in situations of \r\nmass atrocity.\r\nMore is at stake than simply tweaking the edges \r\nof the rule book. Ultimately, our work here is about \r\ncreating conditions of change. It is about ensuring that \r\nthe Security Council fulfils its responsibility and acts \r\nwhen needed. It will be our success or our failure in this \r\nendeavour that shapes how the Council responds to the \r\ncrises of tomorrow.\r\nMr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): We thank you, Sir, for convening today’s \r\nmeeting. Security Council reform is one of the most \r\ncomplex issues on the agenda of the United Nations, \r\nunder whose Charter the Council is the principal organ \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nWe congratulate the Permanent Representatives of \r\nRomania and Tunisia on their appointment as co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations. We trust that \r\ntheir work will be based on the principles of objectivity \r\nand impartiality and will consider the full range of \r\npositions of Member States. The principle of “do no \r\nharm” is of relevance here.\r\nToday’s meeting marks the beginning of \r\ndiscussions on Security Council reform at the seventy-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly. This issue has \r\nbeen discussed for many years now and has presented \r\nextreme difficulties. Member States have been able to \r\nachieve some progress, but a universal solution that \r\ncould enjoy the broadest possible support is not yet \r\nin sight. The positions on reform of the main players \r\ncontinue to differ substantially and are sometimes \r\ndiametrically opposed. That being so, we see no other \r\nalternative but to continue at the current session the \r\npatient, incremental work of bringing our negotiating \r\npositions closer together.\r\nOur own position is well known. Russia, as a \r\npermanent member of the Security Council, emphasizes \r\nthe need to make that organ more representative \r\nthrough the inclusion of developing countries from \r\nAsia, Africa and Latin America. However, efforts to \r\nthis end should not affect the ability of the Security \r\nCouncil to effectively and promptly respond to \r\nemerging challenges. Accordingly, we stand for \r\npreserving the compact composition of the Security \r\nCouncil. Its optimum size should not exceed the low \r\ntwenties. Any proposal to curtail the prerogatives of \r\nthe current permanent members, including the right of \r\nthe veto, are unacceptable to us. It should be recalled \r\nthat the institution of the veto is an important factor \r\nthat encourages Council members to seek balanced \r\nsolutions. It would be historically and politically \r\nincorrect to encroach on that right, and the prerogatives \r\nof the current permanent members should therefore not \r\nbe reviewed.\r\nWe fully support the opinion voiced several times \r\nfrom this rostrum that the process of reforming the \r\nSecurity Council should be owned by all Member \r\nStates without exception, and that its ultimate formula \r\nshould enjoy the widest possible support of Member \r\nStates. If consensus on the issue is impossible, it will \r\nbe politically necessary to obtain the support of a larger \r\nnumber of States than the legally required minimum of \r\na two-thirds majority of the General Assembly.\r\nWe strongly believe that Security Council reform \r\ncannot be addressed through a purely arithmetical \r\napproach by putting various models to the vote in order \r\nto obtain the minimum required number of votes. A \r\nresult reached in this manner would hardly add to the \r\nauthority and effectiveness of the Security Council, \r\nlet alone strengthen the unity of the United Nations. It \r\nwould in fact achieve quite the opposite.\r\nWe are prepared to consider any reasonable option \r\nfor the Security Council’s expansion, including the so-\r\ncalled intermediate approach — which is essentially a \r\ncompromise — provided once again that it is based on the \r\nbroadest possible consensus within the United Nations. \r\nWe expect the efforts of the President of the General \r\nAssembly and the co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n10/28 16-36369\r\nnegotiations to be directed at providing the maximum \r\npossible support and facilitation for the negotiation \r\nprocess, with the understanding that ownership of the \r\nprogress remains with Member States. This meticulous \r\nwork should be conducted in a calm, transparent and \r\ninclusive manner without arbitrary or artificial time \r\nframes. We must all clearly understand that this is a \r\ntask where there is no place for deadlines or attempts \r\nto address this complex problem with a simple stroke \r\nof a pen.\r\nIn conclusion, let us not forget the most important \r\nthing: progress in reforming the Security Council cannot \r\nbe achieved on the basis of some kind of coordinator’s \r\ntexts, negotiating documents or other proposals that \r\nhave not received the approval of all Member States. \r\nPrevious sessions of the General Assembly have shown \r\nthe futility and the danger of attempts to force a solution \r\nto this reform issue that is not based on consensus. It is \r\nequally unacceptable to apply unilateral pressure on the \r\nco-Chairs. \r\nProgress in Security Council reform will depend \r\nsolely on the political will of Member States and their \r\nwillingness to achieve a reasonable compromise. We \r\nurge all Member States to follow this fundamental \r\napproach.\r\nMr. Rycroft (United Kingdom): My thanks go \r\nto Ambassadors Jinga and Khiari for taking on the \r\nleadership of the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nThe United Kingdom is a long-standing and firm \r\nsupporter of the need for reform of the Security Council. \r\nWhen London hosted the first meeting of the Security \r\nCouncil back in 1946, there were 11 members. The \r\nmembership increased to its current 15 in 1965. In the \r\nintervening years, the United Nations has grown and \r\nthe world has changed dramatically, but the Security \r\nCouncil has failed to keep pace with that change. It is \r\nright and fair that the world’s principal organ for the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security should \r\nbe representative of the world it seeks to protect.\r\nThe United Kingdom therefore welcomes all efforts \r\nto move this debate forward, including the establishment \r\nof the Group of Friends. When we consider Security \r\nCouncil reform, we must of course be mindful of the \r\nneed to ensure its effectiveness and make sure that \r\nthis is never compromised. Too great an increase in \r\nsize risks a cumbersome and slow decision-making \r\nprocess, undermining the Council’s ability to respond \r\nappropriately and quickly to issues of international \r\npeace and security. With so many challenges before us, \r\nthat is a risk we cannot take.\r\nBy the same token, we cannot allow the issue of the \r\nveto to slow our progress on expansion of the Council. \r\nThe United Kindgom has not vetoed a resolution for \r\nover 25 years, and we would do so only in the most \r\nexceptional circumstances. We are a proud signatory \r\nof the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\nGroup’s code of conduct, and we are committed to \r\nnever voting against a credible draft resolution on \r\npreventing or ending a mass atrocity. Sadly, we have \r\nseen others wield their veto through narrow self-interest \r\nto the significant detriment of the Security Council’s \r\nreputation and indeed its responsibility to those who so \r\ndesperately need our help.\r\nFor these reasons, we believe that a modest \r\nexpansion in the permanent and non-permanent \r\ncategories, an increase that balances representation \r\nwith effectiveness, is the approach that we should \r\ncollectively pursue. Members will be aware of our \r\nsupport for permanent seats for Brazil, Germany, India \r\nand Japan, alongside permanent African representation. \r\nBritish Prime Minister Theresa May is today in India \r\ndiscussing that very issue with Prime Minister Modi. \r\nOur support is steadfast, and I look forward to working \r\nthrough all available avenues to reach the more \r\nrepresentative and more effective Council that we seek.\r\nMr. Liu Jieyi (China) (spoke in Chinese): China \r\nwelcomes the appointment of Ambassador Jinga, \r\nPermanent Representative of Romania, and Ambassador \r\nMohamed Khiari, Permanent Representative of Tunisia, \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess on Security Council reform. China will actively \r\nsupport their work.\r\n During the membership-led process of negotiations \r\nat the seventieth session of the General Assembly, \r\nMember States carried out in-depth and candid \r\nexchanges of views on the five pillars of reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in a generally practical atmosphere \r\nand achieved favourable results. China appreciates \r\nthat development.\r\nReforming the Security Council is systematic \r\nengineering work involving both the immediate interests \r\nof Member States and the long-term development of the \r\nUnited Nations. China is and has consistently been a \r\nsupporter of an appropriate and necessary reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, advocating that priority be given to the \r\nincreased representation in the Council of developing \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 11/28\r\ncountries, particularly African countries, with a view \r\nto enabling more of them, especially the small and \r\nmedium-sized countries that constitute the majority of \r\nthe United Nations membership, to participate in the \r\nwork and decision-making of the Council and to play a \r\ngreater role in the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nIntergovernmental negotiations provide an \r\nimportant platform for Member States to engage in an \r\nextensive exchange of views, deepen their understanding \r\nof issues and bridge their differences. Such negotiations \r\nshould conform to decision 62/557 and the consensus of \r\nthe membership. They should be membership-led and \r\nshould be based on the proposals and recommendations \r\nof Member States. China supports the work of the \r\nco-Chairs, which, in accordance with decision 62/557 \r\nand based on the principles ogf  of objectivity and \r\nfairness, is aimed at facilitating the efforts of Member \r\nStates to gradually bridge their differences on the \r\nreform of the Council and to steadily move closer \r\ntowards each other’s positions.\r\nChina hopes that Member States will continue \r\nto work constructively in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations and, on the basis of extensive and \r\ndemocratic consultations, will arrive at the broadest \r\npossible consensus on the five groups of issues as one \r\npackage. No artificial deadlines should be set on reform, \r\nnor should any immature proposals be imposed. China \r\nis ready to work together with all sides to ensure that \r\nreform of the Security Council will move in a direction \r\nthat is in both the common interest of Member States \r\nand the long-term interests of the United Nations.\r\nMs. Sison (United States of America): The United \r\nStates looks forward to embarking on another round \r\nof intergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. I would like to welcome our new co-Chairs \r\nAmbassador Jinga and Ambassador Khiari. We will \r\ndepend on the two of them for guidance over the coming \r\nmonths as we work to advance reform. The decision to \r\nput the leadership of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nunder a co-Chair arrangement reflects the practice used \r\nthroughout many of the General Assembly committees \r\nand working groups, and we look forward to seeing \r\nhow that dynamic can encourage the broad consensus \r\nnecessary for reform.\r\nI would also like to extend our deep gratitude to \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas for her leadership as Chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations last year. Her \r\nefforts to encourage members to work towards areas \r\nof convergence were proof that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations can work together to achieve progress. In \r\naddition to a new General Assembly President and new \r\nco-Chairs, this year’s intergovernmental negotiations \r\nwill of course come under the purview of a new \r\nSecretary-General. The United States has been clear \r\nabout our hope that broader United Nations reform \r\nwill be a major priority over the next few years. And \r\nwe understand that many Members would like to see \r\nCouncil reform be a part of that.\r\nWe know that many Member States believe that \r\nintergovernmental negotiations have debated the \r\nissue for far too long, with far too little action and \r\nthat only through text-based negotiations can we \r\nachieve substantial progress. We also recognize that \r\nthere are differences of opinion regarding how we \r\nshould conduct the negotiations and on what text they \r\nshould be based. The United States remains open to all \r\nmanner of negotiations within the framework of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, so long as they help \r\nus arrive at the broad consensus necessary to reach \r\nagreement on Council reform.\r\nReflecting on last year’s intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, while our joint efforts towards convergence \r\nwere serious and certainly commendable, it was also \r\nclear how carefully we would need to proceed for us \r\nall to endorse a common approach. But whatever the \r\neventual path of the negotiations, we must ensure \r\nthat they enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of \r\nthe Security Council and allow us to more effectively \r\naddress the pressing challenges to international peace \r\nand security. Ultimately, we recognize that for reform \r\nto be successful, our decisions must enjoy the broadest \r\npossible consensus. In order to achieve that, the United \r\nStates will support reasonable proposals for modest \r\nexpansion of the Council, in both the permanent and \r\nnon-permanent categories. Any consideration of \r\nwhich countries merit future permanent membership \r\nmust take into account their ability and willingness \r\nto contribute to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security and to their ability to exercise the \r\nheavy responsibilities that come with Security Council \r\nmembership. We remain opposed to any expansion or \r\nalteration of the veto.\r\nYou, Sir, and the co-Chairs have the support of \r\nthe United States as we once more work towards a \r\ncomprehensive solution that can secure the broadest \r\nsupport of the Member States.\r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n12/28 16-36369\r\nMr. Sareer (Maldives): At the outset, I wish \r\nto express my appreciation to you, Mr. President, \r\nfor convening this debate and carrying forward the \r\ndialogue on the important subject of Security Council \r\nreform. In that regard my delegation welcomes \r\nthe appointment of Ambassador Jinga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, and Ambassador Mohamed \r\nKhalid Khiari, Permanent Representative of Tunisia, \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. I also take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our profound gratitude to Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, for \r\nher dedicated efforts and leadership in steering the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the past year.\r\nMy delegation notes that over the years, including at \r\nthe previous session of the General Assembly, Member \r\nStates continued to reaffirm their common desire and \r\naspiration to reform the Security Council in order to \r\nmake it more inclusive, representative, legitimate and \r\naccountable. Yet, a strong divergence of views on how \r\nto achieve reform persists, and that has meant that the \r\nprocess has made little meaningful progress to date.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations share \r\nthe goal of a more representative, accountable, effective \r\nand democratic Security Council. The Maldives has \r\nbeen at the forefront of calls for the reform of the \r\nSecurity Council since 1979. Like other Member States, \r\nthe Maldives is of the view that the comprehensive \r\nreform and expansion of the Security Council are \r\nessential to making it democratic in composition, \r\neffective in decision-making and accountable to the \r\ngeneral membership. We believe that Council reform \r\nshould transcend current global power politics and that \r\nits decisions should reflect the collective will of the \r\ngeneral membership.\r\nReform should not only be based on contemporary \r\nrealities but should also take into account the outcome \r\nof the Council’s decisions. Making the Security Council \r\nmore representative and balanced and its work more \r\neffective and transparent, especially with regard to its \r\ndecision-making process, is vital if the United Nations \r\nis to be adapted to the global realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Such reform should be implemented in \r\nstrict compliance with the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nDuring the high-level segment of the current session \r\nof the General Assembly, many leaders reiterated \r\ntheir call for the reform of the Security Council. My \r\ndelegation believes that that attests to the urgent and \r\ngrowing need for the Assembly to achieve substantial \r\nresults. During the Assembly’s general debate, my \r\ndelegation underlined the importance of having a \r\nfair and equitable opportunity to serve (see A/71/\r\nPV.21). The Maldives believes that the expansion of \r\nthe Council’s membership is essential for the Council’s \r\ncontinued legitimacy and relevance. We believe that the \r\nmembership of the Security Council should come from \r\nboth developing and developed countries, including \r\nfrom small States, and that such membership should be \r\nreflective of the United Nations diverse membership.\r\nThat is why the Maldives is seeking election to a \r\nnon-permanent seat on the Security Council for the \r\nterm 2019-2020. This is the first time that my country \r\nhas presented its candidature for a Security Council seat \r\nsince it became a Member of the Organization 51 years \r\nago. We believe that every country, regardless of size \r\nand might, must have the opportunity to serve, because \r\nwe believe that it is not size but the will to contribute that \r\nmakes a difference, and because, moreover, we believe \r\nthat the opportunity to serve must be based on intent, \r\nresolve, fairness and the principle of representation. \r\nThe Maldives is eager to see a contemporary Security \r\nCouncil that is more representative and influential \r\nand that reflects the changes that have taken place in \r\nrecent years.\r\nConcurrent but separate to the debate on the \r\nlong-term reform of the Security Council, the current \r\nfunctioning and working methods of the Council are \r\nkey focus areas for the Maldives, as well. The Maldives \r\nstrongly supports the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency Group’s code of conduct pertaining to the \r\nSecurity Council, which are key traits that need to be \r\nreflected in the Council’s work and in its relationship \r\nwith the General Assembly. According to the Charter, \r\nthe Security Council acts on behalf of all the Member \r\nStates, and the Member States are mandated to \r\naccept and carry out the decisions of the Security \r\nCouncil. Therefore, the wish of a Member State to be \r\ninformed and, to the extent possible, involved in the \r\ndecision-making process is legitimate. Participation \r\nis every Member State’s right and responsibility. It \r\ngenerates more credibility for the Council and more \r\nownership of its decisions. Moreover, the Council \r\nwould undoubtedly benefit from receiving a wide \r\nrange of ideas and the support of the membership. We \r\nalso ask for the elimination of the disparity between \r\nthe permanent and non-permanent members, which \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 13/28\r\nremains a fundamental f law of the Council in that \r\nsome negotiations and briefings have been limited to \r\nthe permanent members alone.\r\nThe Maldives remains committed wholeheartedly \r\nto the reform process and calls for f lexibility and the \r\nwidest possible political acceptance in proceeding with \r\nthe negotiations. We must be united in taking forward \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations and finding a \r\nsolution that is acceptable to all. It is our earnest hope \r\nthat consensus is achieved in that vein. The Maldives is a \r\nfirm believer in the principles enshrined in the Charter. \r\nWe are a staunch supporter of democracy, the rule of \r\nlaw, equality and justice. We believe in the purposes for \r\nwhich the United Nations was founded, and we believe \r\nthat the world needs such an organization today more \r\nthan ever. Yet, for it to fulfil its promise, live up to the \r\nexpectations of its Members and each and every citizen \r\nthey represent, and deal with the complex challenges of \r\nthe world in which we live, the Organization must take \r\ndrastic measures to remain relevant by reforming itself.\r\nMr. Sobral Duarte (Brazil): Brazil associates \r\nitself with the statements made by the representative \r\nof Germany on behalf of the Group of Four and the \r\nrepresentative of Saint Lucia on behalf of the L.69 \r\ngroup, and would like to add the following comments \r\nin its national capacity.\r\nIn this year’s opening session of the general debate, \r\nPresident Michel Temer underscored that it is vital \r\nto make the structures of global governance more \r\nrepresentative, for many of them have become aged and \r\ndisconnected from reality (see A/71/PV.8). President \r\nTemer also reaffirmed the commitment of Brazil to \r\ncollaborating to overcome the impasse on the reform of \r\nthe Security Council. Brazil was not alone in the general \r\ndebate in highlighting the urgent need for reform. A \r\nsignificant number of countries also expressed concern \r\nabout the outdated structure of the current composition \r\nof the Security Council and spoke of the need to adjust \r\nit to contemporary realities. Many pointed to the \r\ninefficiency and paralysis of the Council in dealing \r\nwith the most pressing challenges to peace and security \r\nof current times. Many more warned that every time \r\na decision on the reform of the Security Council was \r\npostponed, the very credibility and legitimacy of the \r\nUnited Nations system were put at risk.\r\nIt is remarkable that the vast majority of these \r\nstatements comes from developing countries, \r\nwhich are underrepresented in the most important \r\ndecision-making organ of the United Nations. Year \r\nafter year, a considerable number of African countries \r\nreiterate that the underrepresentation of their continent \r\namong the permanent and non-permanent members \r\nof the Security Council is a historical injustice. It is \r\npast time that the underrepresentation of developing \r\ncountries on the Security Council be redressed.\r\nWe cannot neglect the importance of such concerns. \r\nBrazil concurs with your assessment, Sir, that\r\n“[d]uring the seventy-first session, we must work \r\nwith each other across and between traditional \r\ngroups to build trust and f lexibility so that we \r\ncan achieve reform that is for the common good” \r\n(A/71/PV.8, p. 6).\r\nBrazil is confident that you will effectively discharge \r\nyour responsibilities in guiding Member States to reach \r\na decision on the reform of the Security Council.\r\n Member States are already working with each \r\nother. As you are aware, Sir, members of reform-\r\noriented groups, including from the Committee of \r\nTen, the Caribbean Community, the Group of Four, the \r\nL.69 group and representatives of Nordic and Eastern \r\nEuropean countries, as well as permanent members \r\nFrance and the United Kingdom came together to \r\ndiscuss how to move the process of Security Council \r\nreform forward. The Group of Friends of Security \r\nCouncil Reform is a coalition that shares, first, the \r\nsense of urgency for enacting timely reform, as \r\nreflected in the outcome document of the 2005 World \r\nSummit; secondly, the resolve to engage in real, text-\r\nbased negotiations; and, thirdly, the idea that a reformed \r\nSecurity Council would encompass expansion in both \r\ncategories of membership.\r\nThe Group of Friends is yet another instance \r\nof political will aimed at effecting change in the \r\nUnited Nations system. The election process of \r\nSecretary-General designate António Guterres — the \r\nmost transparent and inclusive in the history of the \r\nOrganization — has proved that the membership of the \r\nUnited Nations can rise to the challenges of a reform \r\nprocess. This quest for greater democratization of the \r\nUnited Nations system will not be achieved unless \r\nreform of the Security Council takes place. Former \r\nSecretary-General Kofi Annan’s assessment that “no \r\nreform of the United Nations will be complete without \r\nthe reform of the Security Council” (A/61/1, para. 161) \r\nrings as true today as when it was first voiced in 2006.\r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n14/28 16-36369\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to welcome the \r\nappointment of the Permanent Representative of \r\nRomania, Ambassador Ion Jinga, and the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia, Ambassador Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari, as the Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. Brazil pledges its full support to them. In \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, Brazil expects that \r\nwe will build on progress made during the sixty-ninth \r\nand seventieth sessions. The framework document and \r\nits annex, circulated by former President of the General \r\nAssembly Mr. Sam Kutesa, form a solid basis for text-\r\nbased negotiations. Last year’s exercise has showed \r\nthat convergence is possible. We expect that the new \r\nco-Chairs will take forward the negotiating process \r\nwith the energy required to lead the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiating group towards a concrete outcome.\r\nMr. Oh Joon (Republic of Korea): I thank you, \r\nMr. President, for convening today’s annual debate \r\non Security Council reform. My delegation wishes to \r\nextend a warm welcome to Ambassador Ion Jinga of \r\nRomania and Ambassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari of \r\nTunisia as Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nI would also like to take the opportunity to thank \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg for her hard \r\nwork and contributions in that role in the last year.\r\nAt the outset, my delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nItaly on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group.\r\nThe numerous protracted conflicts — from Syria to \r\nYemen, Libya and Iraq, as well as in the Sahel and the \r\nGreat Lakes region — all point to the need for a Security \r\nCouncil that is effective, accountable and transparent. \r\nThe unprecedented scale of humanitarian crises that we \r\nface today adds to the urgency of the Security Council \r\nreform. The Republic of Korea believes that reform must \r\ntake place in a way that will allow the Security Council \r\nto better address the challenges of international peace \r\nand security, which cannot be accomplished using the \r\noutdated concepts of permanency and veto. Increasing \r\nnon-permanent membership through periodic elections \r\nis the only logical way to achieve this aim.\r\nExpanding the number of elected members alone \r\nwill bring a better balance to the Security Council, \r\nthereby improving its work. Expanding permanency \r\nwould not allow the Council to effectively address \r\nglobal challenges. It is in this vein that the Republic of \r\nKorea supports the French-Mexican political statement \r\non the suspension of the veto in cases of mass atrocities \r\nand the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\nGroup’s code of conduct regarding Security Council \r\naction against genocide, crimes against humanity or \r\nwar crimes.\r\nAt the same time, however, we recognize the \r\naspirations of some Member States to make greater \r\ncontributions to the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. To accommodate such aspirations, \r\nthe Republic of Korea, along with other members \r\nof the Uniting for Consensus group, has advocated \r\nestablishing a new category of longer-term re-electable \r\nseats, details of which can be negotiated.\r\nThe Member States have long debated the issue \r\nof Security Council reform. Personally, I have been \r\nengaged in the debate in one way or another since the \r\n1990s. By now, it seems to me that the debate will \r\ncontinue beyond the diplomatic careers of myself and \r\nmany of my colleagues. In a way, this is understandable \r\nbecause it will be the most important reform in the \r\nhistory of the United Nations. I would just like to \r\nremind the Assembly of the people on the streets \r\nof Aleppo — and many others in the world who are \r\nsuffering from protracted conflicts — who look to the \r\nSecurity Council for solutions and for action. We owe \r\nit to them to deliver what the Charter of the United \r\nNations promises: to save succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war.\r\nI assure you, Mr. President, that the Republic of \r\nKorea stands ready to work with other Member States to \r\nreform the Security Council for the future of our world.\r\nMr. Wenaweser (Liechtenstein): My delegation \r\nwould like to thank Ambassador Lucas of Luxembourg \r\nfor steering the work of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the seventieth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and for her tireless efforts to move \r\nthis very difficult discussion forward. We would also \r\nlike to thank our colleagues from Romania and Tunisia \r\nfor taking on the very difficult task of co-chairing the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We look forward to \r\nworking with them and pledge our full support.\r\nIt is well known that, in the context of discussing \r\nthe enlargement of the Security Council, Liechtenstein \r\nfavours the creation of a new category of membership of \r\nthat body. We propose the creation of six seats with terms \r\nof a longer duration that the current non-permanent-seat \r\nterms — for example, 8 to 10 years — with incumbents \r\neligible for immediate re-election. This model would \r\nenable States to serve and practice permanently on \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 15/28\r\nthe Security Council if they so wish and, of course, if \r\nthey are re-elected consecutively by the United Nations \r\nmembership. The creation of new veto rights, viewed \r\nwith suspicion by many, including us, would be avoided \r\nin this model. The model provides f lexibility in terms of \r\nsize, which we believe can be very useful in enhancing \r\nthe political acceptance of the proposal. If there is a \r\ndesire among the membership to decide on a relatively \r\nsmall enlargement in the first phase, the model we \r\nhave proposed can easily lead to a Council of 21 or 22 \r\nmembers with the creation of six long-term renewable \r\nseats and possibly an additional traditional two-year \r\nseat allocated to the Group of Eastern European States.\r\nIn that case, the option of further enlargement \r\nwould become a central element of the review process. \r\nIn any event, a review clause has an essential place in \r\nour model, as it is both mandatory and comprehensive. \r\nIt would be clearly decided that after a determined \r\nperiod of time — perhaps 16 or 20 years — the General \r\nAssembly would revisit the question of Security \r\nCouncil reform and that all aspects of reform would be \r\non the table in the light of the experience garnered with \r\nan enlarged Council.\r\nIn many ways, the question of the veto is at the heart \r\nof the deadlock in Security Council reform in general \r\nand in the enlargement of the Council in particular. It \r\nis counter-intuitive to many — and we are among the \r\nmany — to create new veto rights. A majority of the \r\nmembership is formally in favour of the abolition of \r\nthe veto, especially in a situation where the veto and \r\nthe threat of the use of the veto is one of the biggest \r\nobstacles for the effective performance of the Security \r\nCouncil on a daily basis, as witnessed most recently \r\non 8 October, when the Council was unable to adopt \r\na resolution on the situation in Aleppo, Syria, due to a \r\nveto that was cast.\r\nGiven the situation in which we find ourselves \r\nresulting from the provisions of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, which means that any change to the \r\nexisting veto rights must be agreed to by the five \r\npermanent members that possess the right, we believe \r\nthat it is crucial to work on modifications in the use \r\nof the veto. The most significant initiative in that \r\nrespect is, in our view, the code of conduct of the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency Group on \r\nmass-atrocity crimes that has been frequently referred \r\nto in the discussion this morning. The code of conduct, \r\nsubscribed to by 112 States, is a meaningful political \r\ncommitment to working in the Security Council to \r\nend and prevent atrocity crimes by supporting credible \r\nproposals for that purpose and pledging not to vote \r\nagainst such proposals if put forward.\r\nWe call on all States that have not yet joined the \r\ncode of conduct to do so expeditiously. We view support \r\nfor the code of conduct at this point as a prerequisite \r\nfor Security Council membership, and it is an essential \r\nelement for us in deciding who we will support in \r\ncontested elections. We will also continue working \r\nwith partners inside and outside of the Council towards \r\nthe active and effective implementation of the code of \r\nconduct in the Council’s practice.\r\nMr. Lamek (France) (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nat the outset to welcome the nomination of Ambassador \r\nIon Jinga and Ambassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari \r\nas co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform. We are confident that \r\nwe can count on their experience and outstanding \r\npersonal qualities to make tangible progress towards \r\nan ambitious reform of the Council. France assures \r\nthem of its full support in the successful fulfilment of \r\ntheir mission.\r\nDiscussions on Security Council reform within the \r\nGeneral Assembly have been ongoing for nearly two \r\ndecades, and it is clear that we have not been able to \r\nresolve the issue. Nonetheless, under the leadership \r\nof Ambassador E. Courtenay Rattray, the work \r\naccomplished during the General Assembly at its sixty-\r\nninth session allowed us to obtain initial results, with the \r\nelaboration of a framework document that could usher \r\nin comprehensive negotiations, and which received the \r\nsupport of a significant majority of Member States. In \r\naddition, the work accomplished during the seventieth \r\nsession under the leadership of Ms. Sylvie Lucas allowed \r\nfor the identification of elements of convergence on two \r\nkey points of the reform. The recent establishment of \r\na Group of Friends of Security Council Reform also \r\nshows the support of a great majority of Member States \r\nin favour of a real start of negotiations.\r\nFrance hopes that all the work that has been \r\naccomplished so far will serve as the foundation for the \r\nnext cycle of intergovernmental negotiations that will \r\ncommence during this session. We must now build on \r\nthis basis and begin text-based negotiations as soon as \r\npossible. We count on the new Chairs to work in that \r\ndirection. France is confident of the ability of Member \r\nStates to come to an agreement on an ambitious reform \r\nproject as they were able to do last year regarding two \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n16/28 16-36369\r\nhistorical agreements, namely, the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. This represents a new opportunity \r\nto show that the United Nations is capable of deep \r\nreform. Such reform is fundamental. Going forward, \r\nthe Council must reflect the reality of today’s world \r\nwhile strengthening its ability to fully shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities in maintaining international peace \r\nand security.\r\nFrance’s position has been constant and is well \r\nknown in that regard. We wish to see the Council \r\nref lect the emergence of new powers that have the \r\nwill and the ability to assume permanent membership \r\nwithin the Security Council, and which, in accordance \r\nwith the Charter of the United Nations, can make a \r\nsignificant contribution to the work of the Council. In \r\nthat regard, as Member States know, France supports \r\nthe candidacies of Germany, Brazil, India and Japan for \r\npermanent membership within the Security Council, \r\nand the increased representation of African countries, \r\nin both the permanent and non-permanent categories.\r\nIt is in the same spirit of responsibility that France \r\nhas proposed that the five permanent members of the \r\nCouncil voluntarily and collectively suspend their use \r\nof the veto in cases of mass atrocities. That voluntary \r\nstep does not require a revision of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations; it requires a political commitment. As \r\nfor France, it has made that commitment at the highest \r\nlevel through the President of the Republic, who \r\nannounced it during the general debate of the seventieth \r\nsession (see A/70/PV.13). This was an extremely \r\nimportant decision for international security, for peace \r\nand for renewed and relegitimized multilateralism.\r\nToday, the joint French-Mexican initiative is \r\nsupported by almost 100 countries. In the same vein, \r\nthe code of conduct prepared by the Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency Group, which France \r\nsupports, has also garnered broad support. Fuelled \r\nby that momentum, we hope that we will be able to \r\nconvince other Member States to join us. It is in the \r\nshared interest of all Member States that the Council be \r\nable to fulfil its mandate and fully perform its role, in \r\nparticular with respect to mass-atrocity situations.\r\nThe initiatives on limiting the right of the veto, \r\nwhich point towards strengthening the fairness \r\nand accountability of the Security Council, are \r\ncomplementary to a comprehensive reform of the \r\nCouncil for which France will continue to advocate. We \r\nmust all collectively shoulder our full responsibility in \r\norder to move beyond the status quo in the interest of \r\nthe Organization. The difficulty of such reform does \r\nnot diminish the pressing need for it.\r\nMr. Moustafa (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank you, Mr. President, for \r\nconvening this meeting on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council and other matters related to the \r\nSecurity Council, and for the importance that you attach \r\nto the expansion of the membership of the Council, \r\nwhich you reaffirmed in your opening statement today.\r\nI would like to commend the efforts of the \r\nsuccessive Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform. I also commend the \r\nefforts made during the past years to achieve \r\nprogress despite all the difficulties and challenges. I \r\nespecially welcome your decision, Mr. President, to \r\nappoint Mr. Ion Jinga, the Permanent Representative \r\nof Romania, and Mr. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, the \r\nPermanent Representative of Tunisia, as the new \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations. This \r\nis a step that reflects your awareness, Sir, of the need \r\nto build the widest possible consensus through the \r\nnegotiations process and to enhance trust and build the \r\nmembership’s confidence. In this regard, we reaffirm \r\nour full support of the two Chairs and reiterate our \r\nconfidence that they will continue to build consensus \r\namong groups and Member States. We wish them every \r\nsuccess in their assignment.\r\nEgypt is firmly convinced that the United Nations \r\nmust undergo comprehensive reform, particularly \r\nof the Security Council, with a view to supporting \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and to enabling the Organization to \r\nrespond to contemporary and emerging international \r\nchallenges. We attach great importance to a true reform \r\nof the Security Council through a transparent and \r\ncomprehensive process that is fully owned by the entire \r\nmembership with a view to reaching a comprehensive \r\nand agreed-upon solution that enjoys the widest political \r\nacceptance and includes the five main interlinked \r\npillars of negotiations set forth in decision 62/557. We \r\nare confident that these clear parameters should be the \r\npoint of reference for the work of the two new Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWe reaffirm that Egypt is firmly committed to the \r\nCommon African Position as set forth in the Ezulwini \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 17/28\r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration, which are the only \r\npoints of reference to have been reaffirmed in successive \r\nAfrican summits, and which include a comprehensive \r\nvision on Security Council reform, including the matter \r\nof the veto. We are satisfied by the increased support for \r\nthe Common African Position, which we consider to be \r\nclear evidence that the world is aware of the importance \r\nof redressing the historic injustice committed against \r\nthe African continent. The African continent still lacks \r\nits well-deserved permanent representation in the \r\nCouncil and equitable representation in the elected-\r\nmember category that would enable Africa to advance \r\nits views on the Council’s work in general and on the \r\nAfrican items on the Council’s agenda in particular, \r\nkeeping in mind that these items occupy most of the \r\nCouncil’s agenda, which in turn affirms the legitimacy \r\nof the continent’s demands.\r\nMrs. Ataeva (Turkmenistan), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThis year, Egypt has been honoured to be a \r\nmember of the Security Council, holding one of the \r\nthree non-permanent seats allocated to Africa. We are \r\ncurrently the only Arab member of the Council and \r\nhave acquired much experience throughout this year. \r\nThis experience has confirmed some of our long-held \r\nconvictions, but we have also learned some lessons, \r\nwhich we would like to share with the Assembly.\r\nFirst, no real Security Council reform is possible \r\nwithout addressing the structural imbalance represented \r\nby the monopoly of the permanent five on the work of \r\nCouncil, due to their exclusive right to the use of the veto. \r\nThis reaffirms the soundness of the Common African \r\nPosition, which calls on principle for the elimination of \r\nthe veto. However, until the veto is eliminated, all new \r\npermanent members of the Council should enjoy all the \r\nprerogatives and privileges of permanent membership.\r\nSecondly, any proposal on partial reform of the \r\nSecurity Council, for example, on the expansion of the \r\npermanent category without a comprehensive reform of \r\nthe veto, would not lead to true and fair reform. Actually, \r\nit would add to the current structural imbalance that \r\nplagues the Council. Indeed, such a reform would serve \r\nthe interests of just a handful of Member States.\r\nThirdly, when the permanent members obtained \r\nthe special privilege of the veto, stemming from the \r\nhistorical situation at the time of the establishment of \r\nthe United Nations, the effectiveness of other members \r\nin the Council depended on their ability to defend the \r\ninterests of their geographical groups, which reaffirms \r\nthat the reform should be based on the principles \r\nof democracy, transparency and accountability. It \r\nalso proves once again the soundness of the African \r\nCommon Position, as it reaffirms the point of \r\nregional representation as the main key issue in the \r\nreform process.\r\nIn conclusion, in the wake of various attempts to \r\nproduce documents and papers in the previous sessions, \r\nI hope that the current efforts will focus on creating \r\na common will to achieve real progress and develop \r\na vision that would help us reach a wider consensus \r\namong States and groups of States in order to reach a \r\nprinciples-based solution that enjoys the widest degree of \r\nacceptance and enhances the confidence of all Member \r\nStates in the intergovernmental negotiations. I would \r\nlike to reaffirm that Egypt is committed to working with \r\nall Member States to adopt a comprehensive reform that \r\nwould enable the Security Council to effectively fulfil \r\nits role of maintaining international peace and security.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): Madam President, we \r\nare pleased to see you presiding over the General \r\nAssembly as we consider the vital question of equitable \r\nrepresentation and an increase in membership of \r\nthe Security Council. Pakistan welcomes the wise \r\ndecision to appoint two of our able colleagues, the \r\nAmbassadors of Tunisia and Romania, to co-facilitate \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations this year. I wish to \r\nconvey to them our profound gratitude for accepting \r\nthis responsibility. I also assure them, as well as you, \r\nMadam, of my delegation’s support.\r\nPakistan fully aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier today by Ambassador Cardi of Italy \r\non behalf of the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) group.\r\nThe deadlock on reform of the Security Council \r\nhas persisted for more than two decades now. Despite \r\nsetting a clear goal in decision 62/557 to seek a \r\nsolution that could garner the widest possible political \r\nacceptance, the General Assembly remains as far from \r\nreaching this goal as ever. But this should not come as a \r\nsurprise. Without a bridge, people on parallel banks of \r\na river continue to remain separated. Here at the United \r\nNations, such bridges are built by accommodation \r\nand f lexibility and cemented by compromise. \r\nUnfortunately, these essential ingredients have been \r\nconspicuous in their absence in our negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n18/28 16-36369\r\nHowever, not everyone has been short on f lexibility. \r\nThe UfC group has twice revised its proposal in a \r\ngenuine spirit of compromise. As evident from the \r\nUfC statement delivered earlier today by Ambassador \r\nCardi, our group stands ready to engage constructively \r\nin this process. But it takes more than one hand to \r\nclap. The hand that refuses to clap represents a handful \r\nof countries that have sought to promote their self-\r\narrogated right to privileged and unequal status. This \r\nselfish pursuit of national ambition is the real reason \r\nfor our failure to make the Security Council more \r\ndemocratic, more accountable, more transparent and \r\nmore effective.\r\nWe cannot change the past, but we can determine the \r\nfuture if the right lessons are learned from past efforts \r\nmade at reform. In the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nprocess, quick fixes and procedural manoeuvres have \r\nnever yielded positive results. A genuine agreement \r\non substance is required to make progress on issues \r\nas consequential as reform of the Security Council a \r\nreality. In protracted negotiations it is impossible to \r\nfind solutions at the extreme ends of political positions. \r\nIn short, compromises leading to convergence on \r\nsubstance are the only way forward. The past three \r\nsessions of the intergovernmental negotiations testify \r\nto this important lesson.\r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations are the only \r\nforum that can achieve progress towards our shared \r\ngoal of a reformed Security Council. The negotiations’ \r\nnature must be respected if we wish for them to serve \r\ntheir purpose. It is a membership-driven process based \r\non the proposals and positions of Member States and \r\nnegotiating groups. The process needs to be open, \r\ntransparent, predictable and inclusive. It must maintain \r\nan ambience of mutual respect, enabling Member States \r\nto engage constructively.\r\nLet me now outline my delegation’s position \r\non Security Council reform. We support expansion \r\nof the Security Council in the category of elected \r\nnon-permanent seats on the basis of equitable \r\ngeographic distribution and a system of fair rotation. \r\nMore elected members will enhance regional \r\nrepresentation and ownership, adding legitimacy to \r\nthe Council. We want a more democratic, accountable, \r\ntransparent and effective Security Council that reflects \r\nthe interests and aspirations of all States Members \r\nof the United Nations. In pursuit of these universally \r\nagreed principles, Pakistan firmly opposes the creation \r\nof new permanent seats. However, we have respect and \r\nreverence for the Common African Position, which \r\nvoices the demand of an entire continent. As such, it \r\nis inherently different from the demand for permanent \r\nseats in pursuit of narrow national ambitions.\r\nNew permanent seats are the antithesis of the \r\nprinciples enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nAddition of more such seats to the Council will serve \r\nonly to satisfy the hunger for power and privilege of a \r\nfew without addressing the actual question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on the Security Council. In the absence \r\nof periodic elections and rotation, new permanent \r\nmembers would not be accountable to the wider \r\nmembership. The Council’s working methods would \r\nbecome more opaque rather than more transparent. \r\nAnd if today the Council remains paralysed and \r\nineffective due to clashing political interests among the \r\npermanent five, we can well imagine how indecisive \r\nand gridlocked it would become with twice the number \r\nof permanent members.\r\nThere is no good rationale or logic for more \r\npermanent seats. Besides, even if one were to \r\ncontemplate additional permanent seats on the basis of \r\nregional representation, can we ever achieve equitable \r\ndistribution in the category of permanent seats? \r\nDespite the logic of these arguments, the much-needed \r\nexpansion of the Council has been held hostage for \r\ndecades to an illogical demand.\r\nNevertheless, we are again ready to engage on those \r\nissues in this year’s intergovernmental negotiations. \r\nAt the most recent session of the negotiations, the \r\nmembership discussed a paper by the Chair on the \r\ntwo key issues of reform: working methods and the \r\nrelationship between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly. In our view, the paper reflected \r\na general convergence on some important principles. \r\nIt is imperative that these principles continue to be \r\nreinforced — and not contradicted — when proposals \r\nand ideas are shared on other key issues of reform.\r\nBefore I conclude, let me once again stress the \r\nimportance of embracing f lexibility and rejecting \r\nrigid approaches. The first expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil was completed in a span of almost three years. \r\nAll States Members of the United Nations benefited \r\nequally at that time, as the number of the Council’s \r\nnon-permanent seats were increased from 6 to 10. But \r\nthe current stalemate of over 24 years has not benefited \r\nany Member State that aspires to serve in the Council. \r\nIt seems that no Member State can have its equal and \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 19/28\r\nfair share because some among us just want it all. That \r\nis not just unfortunate; it represents a selfish disregard \r\nof others.\r\nMr. Matjila (South Africa): I thank you, Madam \r\nPresident, for giving my delegation the opportunity to \r\nexpress our views on the important agenda item before \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nSouth Africa aligns itself with the statements \r\ndelivered by the Permanent Representatives of Sierra \r\nLeone and Saint Lucia, who spoke on behalf of the \r\nAfrican Union member States and the L.69 group of \r\ncountries, respectively. I wish to make the following \r\nadditional remarks in my national capacity.\r\nIn participating in today’s debate, South Africa \r\nremains mindful of the urgent need for Security Council \r\nreform. We encourage all Member States and groups to \r\nwork hard to move the process forward on the basis of \r\nthe gains made in previous sessions. We commend the \r\nPresident for convening this debate early in the seventy-\r\nfirst session. I would also congratulate Ambassador \r\nIon Jinga, Permanent Representative of Romania, and \r\nAmbassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia, on their appointments as \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations, and \r\nassure them of South Africa’s commitment to working \r\nwith them to advance the comprehensive reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations confers on \r\nthe Security Council the primary responsibility for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nThrough its Charter mandate, the Council is given \r\nimportant and far-reaching powers to act on behalf of \r\nthe broader membership of the United Nations. It is \r\ntherefore crucial that the Security Council be reformed \r\nto reflect the realities of the twenty-first century in \r\norder to make the Council more democratic, legitimate, \r\nrepresentative, responsive and transparent in its \r\nworking methods and decision-making processes.\r\nIn 1945, the United Nations had 51 Member States; \r\ntoday it has 193. At that time, in 1945, there were \r\nonly four African States: Egypt, Ethiopia, Liberia and \r\nthe Union of South Africa. Africa today now has 54 \r\nMember States. The historical injustice against the \r\nAfrican continent as reflected in the structure of the \r\nSecurity Council should finally be corrected. We believe \r\nthat the Organization would benefit greatly from our \r\ncontinent’s full participation in the Security Council. \r\nTherefore, my delegation calls on the President and the \r\nChairs of the intergovernmental negotiations to spare \r\nno effort in this session to give priority to and expedite \r\nthe reform process.\r\nSouth Africa is of the view that the main obstacle to \r\nachieving any movement in our ceaseless discussions is \r\nthat the process itself is f lawed. In spite of its name, the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations are not negotiations. \r\nRather, they are debates comprising endless repetition \r\nof decades-old positions from groups and States. \r\nThat is why South Africa and so many other Member \r\nStates have called for the commencement of text-based \r\nnegotiations. We support expansion of the Council in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories, and \r\nwe express the need for reform now.\r\nLike many other States, South Africa was hopeful \r\nthat the seventieth session would build on the significant \r\nachievements of the sixty-ninth. We were bitterly \r\ndisappointed that the process stalled once again. \r\nFortunately, we are at the beginning of a new session and \r\ntherefore wish once again to make our position on the \r\nprocess clear. South Africa reiterates its call for efforts \r\nto build on the progress achieved in previous sessions, \r\nespecially the sixty-ninth session and on the basis of \r\ndecisions 62/557 and 69/560, as well as the framework \r\ndocument and its annex circulated by the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, on \r\n31 July 2015. To achieve such progress, we propose that \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations of the seventy-first \r\nsession be primarily focused on developing a road map \r\nwith a clear implementable framework.\r\nTo achieve that, we further propose that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations adopt a different \r\nformat this year, replacing the debate format that has \r\nbecome our routine with vigorous engagement on the \r\nframework document and how to move it forward. As \r\nwe also believe that the process will benefit from bloc \r\nmeetings, we propose that the Chairs schedule a few \r\nconcurrent days per element to allow for interactive \r\nexchange and negotiations among Member States. \r\nWe have seen over the past years that one-day \r\nmeetings with long lapses of time between them only \r\nresult in general statements repeated ad nauseam, thus \r\nthreatening to turn the process into an endless working \r\ngroup that never achieves reform. We also wish to \r\ncall for the use of the full calendar of the session. We \r\nshould therefore start as soon as possible and continue \r\nfor as long as possible and not let several months go by \r\nwithout scheduling any related activities, as happened \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n20/28 16-36369\r\nin previous sessions. South Africa does not believe that \r\nthe adoption of such a practical process will undermine \r\nthe principles of all-inclusiveness and transparency to \r\nwhich we are fully committed.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation is well aware that the \r\nroad ahead is going to be challenging, but the Assembly \r\ncan rest assured that South Africa, working with other \r\nlike-minded Member States, intends to walk it to its \r\nsuccessful conclusion. We would like to reassure \r\nMember States of our commitment to working with \r\nthe President and the Chairs to move the process of \r\nthe reform of the Security Council forward during the \r\nseventy-first session.\r\nMr. Bessho (Japan): I would like to join the many \r\nothers who have expressed sincere appreciation for the \r\nPresident’s convening today’s important meeting and \r\nwelcome the appointment of Ambassador Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari of Tunisia and Ambassador Ion Jinga of \r\nRomania as the new Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations. As the President of the General Assembly \r\nrightly pointed out when taking the solemn oath of \r\noffice in this Hall on 13 September, “the question is \r\nnot whether reform is necessary, but how and in what \r\nform it will be achieved” (A/70/PV.118, p. 5). We fully \r\nsupport this idea. \r\nI also fully align myself with the statement made by \r\nAmbassador Harald Braun, Permanent Representative \r\nof Germany, on behalf of the Group of Four. \r\nI cannot stress enough how important it is to \r\ncommence text-based negotiations without further \r\ndelay, taking into account that an overwhelming \r\nmajority supports enlargement in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories. I am glad to hear similar \r\nviews from many other Member States. I also greatly \r\nwelcome the establishment of the Group of Friends of \r\nSecurity Council Reform. The voices of this group, \r\nformed around shared opinions, should be taken into \r\nconsideration. \r\nToday I would like to respectfully ask the President \r\nof the General Assembly to give the co-Chairs a clear \r\nmandate to share a road map for text-based negotiations. \r\nWith a road map aimed at a specific outcome, Member \r\nStates can work meaningfully towards a significant \r\noutcome throughout this session of the General \r\nAssembly. We all know very well the positions and \r\nproposals of Member States, as they are all ref lected \r\nin the framework document and its annex, which rolled \r\nover to the current session. During the last session, \r\nwe also heard, once again, detailed statements from \r\nMember States on each of the five key issues. What \r\nwe have to do now is to start preparing a concise and \r\noperational negotiation text, preferably in the form of a \r\ndraft resolution, and to immediately launch negotiations \r\nwithin a specific time frame. \r\nI hope that we will be able to enter into serious \r\ntext-based negotiations and not into another exhausting \r\nround of speeches. Let us not get ourselves bogged \r\ndown in procedural discussions any longer. We are too \r\nfamiliar with that approach and have perfected the art \r\nof delay. Instead, let us engage with one another on \r\nsubstance in the coming text-based negotiations. It is \r\ntime for concrete action to back our many words of \r\nreform. \r\nBefore closing, let me quote Mr. Kofi Annan, whose \r\nwords were taken up by Secretary-General-designate \r\nAntónio Guterres at the informal dialogue on 12 April: \r\n“No reform of the United Nations will be complete \r\nwithout the reform of the Security Council” (A/61/1, \r\npara. 161).\r\nMr. Winid (Poland): Let me thank the President \r\nfor convening today’s important annual debate. \r\nAt the outset, Poland would like to warmly \r\nwelcome the nomination of our good friends, the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Romania and Tunisia, as \r\nthe new Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non Security Council reform. This is the first time \r\nthat the intergovernmental negotiations will be led by \r\ntwo co-Chairs. We therefore hope that not only our \r\nco-Chairs, but also all Member States, will redouble \r\ntheir efforts to bring about a positive outcome to our \r\nnegotiations. \r\nI also take this opportunity to thank the two \r\nprevious Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nAmbassador E. Courtenay Rattray of Jamaica and \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg, for their \r\nsignificant work and determination to bridge the \r\ndivisions that remain among Member States. \r\nAs we will soon resume the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, let me reflect on how we shall approach \r\nthe task ahead of us. First of all, we shall continue our \r\ndialogue in good faith but we also shall have faith in \r\nourselves. Only a year ago we managed to finalize \r\nthree fundamental processes — on the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, on financing for development and \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 21/28\r\non climate change — which will guide our work for \r\nthe coming decades. I truly believe that we should be \r\nable to add to those accomplishments a major political \r\nagreement on the future shape of the Security Council.\r\nWith the growing complexity of today’s security \r\nlandscape and the multiplying challenges and threats, \r\nif we are to find good and lasting solutions, we need \r\nto sit together, talk and carefully listen — especially \r\nlisten — to each other. Since the security issues that \r\nwe need to address are often interconnected — they \r\nare not merely intra-State; rather, they reach across \r\nStates’ borders, regions and continents — it does \r\nmatter who sits on the Security Council and receives \r\nour mandate to act on behalf of the entire United \r\nNations membership. It does matter whether the voices \r\nof African States, Arab States, small developing States \r\nor Eastern European States — my regional group — are \r\nheard and are reflected in the Council’s decisions to a \r\ngreater extent than they are today.\r\nSecondly, we shall build on our work on the \r\nreform of the Security Council that was carried out \r\nin the past, especially in the previous two rounds of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. We learned a \r\nlot about our positions, defined areas of convergence \r\nand identified the main points of division. Let us now \r\nengage in a truly meaningful process of give and take.\r\nLast but not least, the result of the negotiations \r\nmust be backed by all Member States. In our opinion, \r\nonly a consensus can guarantee that we will be able \r\nto fully implement an agreement once negotiations \r\nare concluded.\r\nPoland remains committed to the idea of having a \r\nmore transparent, more equitable and effective Security \r\nCouncil. We will do our best to fully and constructively \r\nengage in Member States’ dialogue during the next \r\nround of the intergovernmental negotiations. My \r\ncountry will give unwavering support to all efforts \r\nleading to the much-needed agreement on Security \r\nCouncil reform.\r\nMr. Rivero Rosario (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nWe welcome the convening of this debate, and in that \r\nconnection we recognize the efforts of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Luxembourg and Jamaica and \r\ntheir predecessors in leading the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We welcome \r\nthe appointment of the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Romania and Tunisia as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on this most pressing \r\nissue. We pledge our full cooperation so that these \r\nnegotiations may be successful.\r\nCuba supports the genuine and profound reform \r\nof the Security Council into an effective, transparent, \r\nrepresentative and democratic body. We support \r\nrenewed and sustained efforts to fast-track negotiations \r\non Security Council reform, which is an issue that has \r\nbeen on the General Assembly agenda for more than 20 \r\nyears. We must continue to advocate for the adaptation \r\nof the Security Council in line with developments in \r\ninternational relations and within the United Nations \r\nitself over the past seven decades.\r\nIn accordance with Article 24 of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Council is responsible for acting on \r\nbehalf of Member States. However, the reality is that \r\nthe 193 States Members of the United Nations do not \r\nfeel represented by the decisions of the Council, making \r\nit difficult to maintain the status quo established in \r\n1945. Cuba reiterates that the work of the Council is \r\nthe collective responsibility of all Member States, and \r\nthat they should be guaranteed real participation in the \r\nwork and decision-making processes that this body \r\nundertakes. For this reason, we must fully carry out the \r\nmandate bestowed by the General Assembly through \r\nvarious decisions, including the most recent, of 21 July, \r\non the question of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council and \r\nother matters related to the Security Council.\r\nThe rounds of discussions that have taken place thus \r\nfar and the various positions that have been expressed \r\nconfirm, in our opinion, that the vast majority of \r\nMember States supports, at the very least, the expansion \r\nof Security Council membership in its two categories of \r\npermanent and non-permanent members. Moreover, we \r\nmust eliminate the veto, reform the working methods \r\n,  potentially leading to the gradual approval of the \r\nCouncil’s rules of procedure so that they are no longer \r\nprovisional, and abide by the respective mandates of \r\nthe General Assembly and the Security Council in \r\naccordance with the provisions of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nCuba is prepared to undertake the negotiations \r\nrequired for this process without further delay. We \r\nagree with the majority of delegations that all proposals \r\nmade during the intergovernmental negotiations must \r\nbe taken into account. This process must be inclusive \r\nand transparent. Although Cuba’s position is well \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n22/28 16-36369\r\nknown, I would like to reiterate the following for the \r\nbenefit of the new round of discussions.\r\nWe are in favour of a substantial increase in the \r\nmembership of the Security Council to around 25 or \r\n26 States. Such expansion must take place within both \r\ncategories of members and must include developing \r\ncountries. The fundamental objective should be to \r\novercome the unjustifiable lack of representation of \r\ndeveloping countries in the Security Council. The new \r\nmembers — both permanent and non-permanent — of \r\na wider Council must have the exact same duties and \r\nprerogatives as the current members of the body, including \r\nthe veto if it cannot be eliminated. Cuba would not be \r\nopposed to the possibility of immediately re-electing \r\nnon-permanent members. Cuba is not in favour of \r\ncreating new member categories, as this would further \r\ndeepen existing differences and foster division within \r\nthis body. As for the veto, Cuba’s position is well known \r\nwith regard to this anti-democratic and anachronistic \r\nprivilege. It is our firm conviction that the veto should \r\nbe eliminated.\r\nThe reform of the Council must include, as a \r\npriority, reform of its working methods. We advocate \r\nfor a transparent Security Council in which closed \r\nconsultations are the exception and not the rule. We are \r\nin favour of a Council that keeps to the issues that are \r\nwithin its domain and does not encroach on the preserves \r\nof other principal bodies of the United Nations.\r\nI reiterate that Cuba does not hope to achieve an \r\nimmediate agreement: we understand perfectly the \r\ncomplexities and sensitivities of this process which will \r\nrequire time, effort and, above all, a spirit of f lexibility \r\nduring negotiations. Nevertheless, we cannot accept \r\nas valid the structure and procedures of a Security \r\nCouncil that was established in 1945 for a world order \r\nthat no longer exists, especially in the face of threats \r\nand challenges that would have been unimaginable \r\nback when the Organization was created. That would \r\nbe a total disregard of the dramatic developments in \r\ninternational relations and within the United Nations \r\nitself throughout the past 70 years. Cuba is ready to \r\nsuccessfully overcome this challenge.\r\nMr. Tenya Hasegawa (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation welcomes this meeting of the General \r\nAssembly to continue discussing one of the fundamental \r\nissues linked to reforming the Organization — the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council.\r\nAs well as commending the work carried out by the \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, Ambassador \r\nSylvie Lucas, during the past cycle of intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, we welcome the appointment of the \r\nPermanent Representive of Romania, Ion Jinga, and \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Tunisia, Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari, as co-Chairs of the same process during \r\nthis current session. They can count on the full support \r\nof my delegation.\r\nThe overwhelming majority of those present \r\nagree on the necessity and importance of adapting the \r\nstructure of our Organization following the tremendous \r\nchanges that the international system has experienced \r\nin past decades, such as the end of the cold war and \r\nthe significant increase in the number of States, to cite \r\njust two examples. In this regard, the intensification \r\nof our efforts is especially important in order to make \r\nthe desired reform of such a fundamental body of \r\nthe United Nations as the Security Council a reality. \r\nIt must be made more democratic, representative and \r\ntransparent: a delicate responsibility that falls without \r\nexception on each and every one of us. Carrying \r\nout this task becomes even more imperative in the \r\ncurrent climate, where delicate situations such as in \r\nthe one in the Middle East, and particularly the grave \r\nconflict in Syria, require effective responses from the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nPeru reiterates once again its conviction \r\nthat in order to bring the Security Council into \r\nstep with current realities, it is indispensable to \r\nincorporate new members — permanent as well as \r\nnon-permanent — in order to promote fairer and more \r\nequitable regional representation. My delegation wishes \r\nto underscore that the enlargement should be carried \r\nout with moderation in order to remedy the imbalance \r\nin the composition of the Council, while at the same \r\ntime safeguarding its effectiveness. In that regard, we \r\nbelieve it essential to stress the need for increasing the \r\nseats reserved for our regions, which should no longer \r\nshunted aside.\r\nBecause of the different approaches to the \r\nintegration of new permanent members, my country \r\nproposes that, as an interim measure until consensus \r\nis reached, there should be an intermediate category in \r\nwhich non-permanent members of the Security Council \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 23/28\r\ncould serve terms of over two years and be indefinitely \r\nre-elected to serve consecutive terms.\r\nI would also like to stress the issue of the veto. \r\nPeru has consistently supported initiatives to limit \r\nits use and to ban its use in cases of genocide, crimes \r\nagainst humanity and f lagrant violations of human \r\nrights or international humanitarian law. In that regard, \r\nwe support the French and Mexican initiative on that \r\nissue as well as the code of conduct drawn up by the \r\nAccountability, Coherence and Transparency Group, to \r\nwhich my country belongs.\r\nExperience teaches us that we will not make real \r\nprogress in the negotiations until we make a greater \r\neffort to be f lexible, in the interest of the common \r\ngood. When we adopt this compromise approach, \r\nwe will have to make concessions and soften our \r\npositions. Then, finally, we shall end up with a more \r\nharmonious, legitimate and balanced system that will \r\nbenefit everyone. After so many years spent immersed \r\nin deliberation and discussion on this subject, we think \r\nthat the time has come to act.\r\nMr. Begeç (Turkey): We align ourselves with the \r\nstatement delivered by the Permanent Representative \r\nof Italy on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus (UfC) \r\ngroup. The following are additional remarks in my \r\nnational capacity.\r\nWe appreciate the engagement of the President \r\nof the General Assembly in the process and warmly \r\nwelcome Ambassadors Jinga and Khiari in their new \r\ncapacities as co-Chairs. We look forward to cooperating \r\nclosely with them. We also express our gratitude to \r\nthe former Chair, Ambassador Lucas, for her efforts \r\nto find elements of convergence, which is the correct \r\napproach in attempting to reach consensus on this \r\nimportant matter.\r\nThe need for Security Council reform is \r\nunmistakable. While we diplomats have been discussing \r\nthis matter for the past couple of decades, the Council’s \r\ninaction has been costing human lives. That is the \r\ndisturbing reality that we sometimes overlook when \r\nconcentrating on technical details.\r\nPermanent membership and the veto mechanism are \r\nthe obvious targets for reform. It is therefore difficult to \r\nunderstand why Member States, rather than rectifying \r\nthe situation, are seeking to consolidate permanent \r\nmembership and the veto mechanism. Increasing the \r\nnumber of permanent members and the ratio of those \r\nwith veto power to those without it will simply make \r\nmatters worse. Additionally, we do not know how \r\nintroducing new permanent members or veto powers \r\nwould enhance the accountability of the Council. \r\nLikewise, we do not know what mechanism would be \r\nused for assessing the performances of those countries \r\nafter they become Council members.\r\nWe are advocating for a meaningful and principled \r\nreform that would bring about a more democratic, \r\nrepresentative, effective, transparent and, above all, \r\naccountable Council. We believe that this only be \r\nachieved can by increasing the number of elected \r\nmembers of the Council. For those aspiring to a longer \r\nterm in service of the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, we, the UfC Group, propose longer-\r\nterm seats with the possibility of re-election. We are \r\npleased to see that there is increasing support for the \r\nintermediate approach as a compromise solution.\r\nIdeally, the veto should be abolished. There is \r\nno justifiable explanation as to why certain Council \r\nmembers should have that right and others not. In that \r\nrespect, we support the initiatives to limit the use of \r\na negative vote in cases of mass atrocities. A more \r\nequitable representation of the regional groups and a fair \r\nsystem of rotation, including enhanced opportunities \r\nfor underrepresented groups, is a must in a reformed \r\nCouncil. The working methods and the relationship with \r\nthe General Assembly are no less important matters, as \r\nthey determine the daily dynamics of the system.\r\nSecurity Council reform is a matter of global \r\nimportance, which should naturally go beyond the \r\nnational aspirations and interests of any individual \r\nState. Needless to say, an issue that has a direct impact \r\non the lives of current and future generations requires \r\ncompromise and a consensual process.\r\nMr. Kamau (Kenya): My delegation attaches great \r\nimportance to agenda item 122, “Question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership \r\nof the Security Council and other matters related to \r\nthe Council”.\r\nLet me begin by commending the President for \r\nhis dedication and commitment to advancing the \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council. \r\nI congratulate Ambassador Ion Jinga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, and Ambassador Mohamed \r\nKhaled Khiari, Permanent Representative of Tunisia, on \r\ntheir appointment as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n24/28 16-36369\r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. I assure the \r\nco-Chairs of my delegation’s support and cooperation.\r\nMy delegation fully aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by the representative of Sierra Leone \r\non behalf of the African Union member States.\r\nKenya reaffirms its full support and commitment \r\nto the common African position and Africa’s legitimate \r\nclaim, as embodied in the Ezulwini Consensus and \r\nthe Sirte Declaration. My delegation also supports \r\nthe statement of the Group of African States and \r\nrecognizes that it has comprehensively addressed the \r\nsubstantive issues on Security Council reform that are \r\nof the greatest concern to Africa and the wider United \r\nNations membership, in general. In the interests of \r\nbrevity and to avoid repetition, my delegation would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to make some remarks.\r\nFirst of all, I believe I speak for many African \r\nStates and all Member States that believe that the \r\nwhole United Nations system must be reformed to \r\nadapt to the changing global realities and to enhance its \r\neffectiveness in solving present, emerging and future \r\nthreats. Making the United Nations fit for purpose and \r\ncapable of facing the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury is now a matter of urgent importance.\r\nSecondly, as the principal organ responsible for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nthe Security Council exemplifies a structure that is not \r\ncompatible with the current geopolitical realities of the \r\nworld. It is outdated, outmoded and not fit for the purpose \r\nof promoting and sustaining peace and security in our \r\nworld. The status quo is dangerous — it undermines \r\npeace and it causes and prolongs death and suffering.\r\nThirdly, the Council’s small size, exclusive nature \r\nand dysfunctional character is based on mid-twentieth- \r\ncentury geopolitics and prejudices. Its relationship \r\nwith the General Assembly, its working methods and \r\nits undemocratic nature are out of step with today’s \r\nchallenges and demands.\r\nFourthly, Kenya believes that it is important for \r\nthe United Nations to meet contemporary standards \r\nof modern civilization and human rights, including \r\nlegitimacy based upon accountability and democratic \r\ndecision-making procedures and representation. The \r\nfundamental challenge to the Security Council is \r\nthat some regions of the world do not have adequate \r\nor effective representation on the Council, and a \r\nconsiderable portion of the United Nations global \r\nconstituency is therefore unrepresented and unheard in \r\nthe administration of global affairs. This is the recipe \r\nthat is responsible for the gridlock and dysfunction in \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMy delegation is convinced that it is imperative \r\nthat the Council be reformed to enable it to meet \r\ncontemporary standards and the demands of the \r\ntwenty-first century. It is unacceptable that Africa, on \r\nwhich a large part of the security agenda of the United \r\nNations is concentrated, and which is also the focus of \r\nconsiderable work by United Nations peacebuilding and \r\npeacekeeping personnel, has no determinative voice in \r\nthe Council.\r\nIt is therefore incumbent upon us, the United Nations \r\nmembership, to collectively ensure that the Security \r\nCouncil reform process moves forward on the five key \r\nissues specified in decision 62/557, a decision that is \r\nsupported by the African Union and the Government \r\nof Kenya. We believe that the progress reflected in \r\ndecision 69/560 provides a valuable basis for our \r\ncollective efforts to work towards the comprehensive \r\nreform of the Security Council by means of text-\r\nbased negotiations.\r\nFinally, my delegation looks forward to engaging \r\nin open and transparent negotiations, where the entire \r\nmembership has an equal voice. We must build on that \r\nas part of our efforts to make the United Nations a more \r\nefficient and effective instrument in the service of all \r\nthe peoples of the world. No meaningful reform of \r\nthe collective United Nations system will be achieved \r\nwithout the reform of the Security Council.\r\nMr. Inguanez (Malta): I wish to join the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Italy, Mr. Sebastiano Cardi, who \r\nspoke on behalf of the Uniting for Consensus group, \r\nand many other speakers in extending my appreciation \r\nand gratitude to the President for convening this annual \r\ndebate on Security Council reform. I am sure that under \r\nthe new General Assembly leadership, this important \r\nitem on the Assembly’s agenda will be given due \r\nconsideration and receive fresh impetus. We have already \r\nseen evidence of the determination and enthusiasm to \r\nmove forward on the issue in the appointment of the \r\ntwo co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nAmbassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari, the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia, and Ambassador Ion Jinga, \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Romania, to whom \r\nwe extend our congratulations and full support in their \r\nsensitive task.\r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 25/28\r\nThe Security Council remains an important source \r\nof legitimacy for international action. Yet, despite the \r\npolitical changes, the development of the international \r\nand regional systems, the dramatic events on the \r\ninternational security scene and the consolidation \r\nof global challenges, the composition of the Security \r\nCouncil has remained unaltered since 1965. We all \r\nagree that the Security Council of today is not a faithful \r\nreflection of the new world order of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. There are some, if not many, who question how \r\nlong the Council’s legitimacy will last if its composition \r\nis not changed to reflect today’s realities. That brings \r\nto the fore the question of urgency — of finding a way \r\nthrough the complex and multifaceted issue of reform.\r\nMalta has always believed that the founding \r\nargument of the Uniting for Consensus Group, of \r\nwhich we are a part, is based on the conviction that \r\nthe different positions of countries are hard to reconcile \r\nand that, therefore, a consensual approach is needed \r\nin order for an early reform to take place. It is Malta’s \r\nconviction that a pragmatic approach is required and \r\nthat the whole family of nations stands to gain from \r\ncompromise and the sharing of the advantages of a \r\nsolution that is acceptable to the widest possible range \r\nof the United Nations membership. Malta also believes \r\nthat a consensual approach is inherently an adaptable \r\nand f lexible approach.\r\nPractically all States today agree that there is a \r\nneed for reform. What is elusive is, of course, how to \r\nreform. In our view, a meaningful reform proposal is \r\none that tries to strengthen the democratic, functional, \r\nrepresentational and effective features of the \r\nOrganization, while being realistic about the restraints \r\nand limitations that this intergovernmental process has \r\nencountered over the past two decades. It is in that sense \r\nthat we argue for change where change is possible.\r\nIn line with this thinking, Malta holds that the key to \r\nunblocking the present stalemate is in expanding where \r\nexpansion is possible. We think that the most possible \r\nreform formula is one that focuses on an expansion of \r\nthe non-permanent seats of the Council — first, by \r\nincreasing the current number of non-permanent seats, \r\nand secondly, by establishing a new category of longer-\r\nterm non-permanent seats with the possibility of an \r\nimmediate re-election. In that way those States willing \r\nto make a larger contribution to the work of the Council \r\nwould have the right to contest elections for a longer-\r\nterm seat while creating more space for other States to \r\nparticipate in their respective regional groups.\r\nToday’s debate faces far fewer questions about \r\nwhether or not reform is necessary. It rather focuses on \r\nwhat kind of reform is possible. As we have moved from a \r\nposition of questioning to accepting the need for reform, \r\nMalta believes that the time has now come to take the next \r\nstep — moving from accepting that reform is inevitable \r\nto defining what type of reform can realistically be \r\nachieved. In doing so, a greater understanding of what \r\nis at stake and a greater willingness to listen to all \r\nviews are needed. I daresay that what is needed most is \r\ngreater courage — the courage to face the reality that \r\nthe status quo is increasingly becoming a non-option. \r\nWith that in mind, Malta stands ready to continue to \r\ncooperate with the President, with the new co-Chairs \r\nand with the whole United Nations membership in the \r\nsearch for a reform model that has the support of the \r\nwidest possible consensus.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): I join previous speakers in \r\ncongratulating Ambassador Ion Jinga of Romania and \r\nAmbassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari of Tunisia on their \r\nappointment to lead the work of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. I assure them \r\nof the support of my delegation.\r\nWe begin today the thirteenth round of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. The stark reality is that we have been talking \r\nabout Security Council reform for more than a \r\ndecade without making any progress. So, we need \r\nto ask some hard questions: are we serious about \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations process or about \r\nSecurity Council reform? Has the negotiating process \r\nbecome a ritual with no outcome — a ritual that over \r\ntime has become an end in itself? If this is just a ritual \r\nwith no outcome, what is the real utility of the process? \r\nAnd after a decade, have the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations become an integral part of the landscape \r\nof the status quo, or are they a vehicle to change the \r\nstatus quo?\r\nI leave those questions for reflection by all members. \r\nThere is a more fundamental question that needs to be \r\nanswered, if not publicly then at least privately. Are \r\nthe permanent members really interested in Security \r\nCouncil reform of any kind? No one here is naive enough \r\nto believe that the five permanent members (P-5), as \r\nprivileged members of the status quo, will become \r\nenthusiastic champions of Security Council reform. \r\nHowever, what exactly are the elements of reform that \r\nthe P-5 are prepared to accept? Do the P-5 want the \r\nintergovernmental negotiation sprocess to deliver any \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n26/28 16-36369\r\noutcome? And if so, what kind of outcome? And what \r\nkind of timeline do they have in mind? We will need \r\ngreater clarity on the positions of the P-5 in order to \r\nmake progress in the intergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWe cannot continue our work in a business-as-usual \r\nmanner. The world has changed considerably since the \r\nUnited Nations was established in 1945. The United \r\nNations is now facing more intractable challenges than \r\never to peace and security. Yet, the Security Council, \r\nwhich is tasked with the primary responsibility of \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, remains \r\ndeeply paralysed. It is unable to deal with real conflict \r\nsituations in Syria and Yemen, at the cost of so many \r\ninnocent lives.\r\nJust a month ago, the world witnessed an unusual \r\nspectacle of vetoes and counter-vetoes in the Security \r\nCouncil over the question of Syria. If there was any \r\nproof needed for urgent reforms to the Security Council, \r\nthat meeting a month ago provided a strong case. If \r\nthe Security Council, in particular the permanent \r\nmembers, are unable to exercise leadership to resolve \r\npressing issues of the day, the case for reform becomes \r\nstronger, not weaker. And if the P-5 were to use the \r\nSecurity Council as the platform to advance their own \r\ninterests or push their pet agendas, then Member States \r\nwould become cynical about the role of the Council. \r\nUltimately, the need for Security Council reform is \r\nlinked to the need to preserve the credibility of the \r\nUnited Nations, the credibility of the Security Council \r\nand, above all, the credibility of the permanent members \r\nof the Council. It is therefore vitally important that the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations deliver an outcome \r\nthat will strengthen the effectiveness, accountability, \r\ninclusiveness and transparency of the Security Council.\r\nMy delegation is ready to engage constructively \r\nand committed to making genuine progress in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. I wish to provide a \r\nbrief recap of Singapore’s position on the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform. We support expansion in \r\nboth the permanent and non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership to make the Council more representative \r\nand inclusive. But we also believe that any reform of the \r\nSecurity Council must go beyond just increasing the \r\nnumber of seats. Reform should make the Council more \r\naccountable, transparent and inclusive for everyone, not \r\njust for aspirants to permanent membership. That is an \r\nimportant issue for many small States, as we do not have \r\nmany opportunities to serve in the Security Council.\r\nWe therefore attach great importance to improving \r\nthe working methods of the Council. We have made \r\na number of practical proposals to enhance the \r\ntransparency and accountability of the Security \r\nCouncil. Of note, we have joined many countries to \r\nsupport limiting the use of the veto by the P-5. We \r\ndo not support extending the veto to new permanent \r\nmembers, as we do not think additional vetoes will \r\nenhance the effectiveness of the Council to respond \r\nto threats to peace and security. We hope that the \r\nthirteenth intergovernmental negotiations process will \r\ntake these proposals up when it resumes its work later \r\nthis year.\r\nAs we start a new round of negotiations, I would \r\nlike to make some general points.\r\nFirst, we need to inject greater urgency into our \r\nwork. The intergovernmental negotiations in particular \r\nmust discuss the elephant in the room and address the \r\nuse of the veto. If we fail to do so, we will relegate \r\nthe work of the negotiations to irrelevance. Singapore \r\nsupports the French-Mexican initiative calling on \r\nthe P-5 to voluntarily and collectively pledge not to \r\nuse the veto in cases of recognized mass atrocities. \r\nWe also support the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency (ACT) Group’s initiative on a code of \r\nconduct on Security Council action against genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity or war crimes. We welcome \r\nthe fact that two P-5 members support the initiative of \r\nthe ACT group to restrict the use of the veto in certain \r\ncircumstances. We think that their leadership on this \r\nspecific issue is commendable. Clearly, there is a \r\ngrowing momentum and growing urgency in favour of \r\nlimiting the use of the veto in cases of mass atrocities. \r\nThe intergovernmental negotiations must recognize \r\nthat trend and focus its attention on the important issue \r\nin order to make concrete progress. We also welcome \r\nthe recent establishment of the Group of Friends on \r\nSecurity Council Reform, which includes, we note, the \r\nparticipation of two P-5 members.\r\nSecondly, much work has already been done in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process. We should not \r\nstart from scratch but rather build on our past successes \r\nand good work done. We have a useful framework \r\ndocument, which was circulated by the President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its sixty-ninth session, in July \r\n2015. We need to build on that framework document \r\nand find common ground on each of the five key issues. \r\nSome progress was achieved this year under Chair \r\nSylvie Lucas of Luxembourg, who prepared elements \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.42\r\n16-36369 27/28\r\nof convergence on two of the five key issues. We need \r\nto continue to identify similar elements of convergence \r\non the other three key issues. As I mentioned earlier, \r\nthere seems to be growing support for limiting the use \r\nof the veto, and we hope that the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations can make progress on this important issue.\r\nThirdly, we need to prioritize our work and try to \r\nidentify quick areas for implementation. Even as we \r\ntry to identify areas of convergence in the other three \r\noutstanding areas, we should look again at the elements \r\nof the convergence paper and work to identify practical \r\nsteps that we can take now, without any amendments \r\nto the Charter of the United Nations, to improve the \r\npractices of the current Council. The intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process can and must make progress in \r\nareas where there is strong support from the United \r\nNations membership.\r\nThe appointment of two co-Chairs is a good start. \r\nIt shows our willingness to think outside of the box and \r\ntry fresh approaches. Hopefully, with two co-Chairs \r\nwe can double our effort in the quest for progress. The \r\nPresident has set the tone for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations process in the seventy-first session. My \r\ndelegation will work with the President and the two \r\nco-Chairs to achieve a good outcome.\r\nMr. Djani (Indonesia): I promise I will be as brief as \r\npossible. Let me first thank the President for convening \r\nsuch an important debate. I would like to congratulate \r\nAmbassador Ion Jinga of Romania and Ambassador \r\nKhaled Khiari of Tunisia on their appointment to \r\nco-chair the intergovernmental negotiations at the \r\nseventy-first session. My delegation assures them of its \r\nconstructive engagement and support. We also express \r\nour gratitude to Ambassador Lucas of Luxembourg \r\nfor chairing the intergovernmental negotiations at the \r\nprevious session.\r\nAs the recent open debate in the Security Council on \r\nspecial political missions (see S/PV.7802) highlighted \r\nonce again, the United Nations is faced by significant \r\nchallenges owing to a deteriorating global environment \r\nresulting from the increase in the number of civil wars \r\nsince 2008 and various unresolved conflicts. The \r\nability and credibility of the Security Council, which is \r\nunable to effectively perform its Charter role, are being \r\nquestioned on a broad scale. Palestine and Syria are two \r\nsituations where a persistent lack of principled action \r\nby the Council and division among its members have \r\nworsened conditions for people and made the conflicts \r\nmore intractable.\r\nIndonesia calls for a comprehensive reform of \r\nthe Security Council, which will make it effective, \r\naccountable, democratic and representative \r\nof contemporary world realities and plurality. \r\nOrganizations are successful only when they remain \r\ntrue to their fundamental objectives and mandates, and \r\nonly when they are able to meet the demands placed \r\non them. It is therefore logical to ponder the efficacy \r\nof the Security Council structure if that affects the \r\nmanner in which the Council is governed and if there \r\nare problems that prevent the Charter mandate and the \r\nUnited Nations ideals from being fulfilled. One obvious \r\nhurdle is the arbitrary use of the veto, which, in the face \r\nof mass atrocities, has rendered the Council powerless \r\non too many occasions. The use of the veto goes against \r\nthe wishes of the majority, while negating democracy.\r\nWhile Indonesia is in principle for the abolishment \r\nof the right of the veto in the Council, given the \r\npresent entrenched realities, it welcomes steps that will \r\nstrictly regulate its use. We support having a workable \r\nmechanism to ensure that the veto will not be used for \r\nperverting the cause of humanity and justice. That is \r\nwhy Indonesia supports the initiative on refraining \r\nfrom the use of the veto in situations of mass crimes, as \r\nwell as the code of conduct regarding Security Council \r\naction against genocide, crimes against humanity and \r\nwar crimes. The Council must stand unconditionally \r\nfor upholding international justice, human rights law \r\nand humanitarian law.\r\nElitist privileges and the arbitrary promotion of \r\nthe interests of a few can undermine the principle of \r\ncollective decision-making needed to resolve conflicts \r\njustly and in a coherent and sustained manner. The \r\nCouncil membership should therefore be governed \r\nby democratic principles and effective practices. \r\nIndonesia envisages that in the long run there will be no \r\nsegregation in the Council membership and the division \r\nbetween permanent and non-permanent categories will \r\neventually cease to exist.\r\nWe also believe that developing countries, especially \r\nemerging nations, which are demonstrating their \r\nprowess in democracy, economic matters, development \r\nand peace and security — particularly those that have \r\ncontributed troops to peacekeeping operations — should \r\nbe given more responsibility in the Council as active \r\nagents for helping to resolve ongoing conflicts and \r\nA/71/PV.42 07/11/2016\r\n28/28 16-36369\r\nemerging threats. Their experiences would bring new \r\nperspectives to the Council’s decision-making while \r\nenriching the quality of its working methods and \r\nactions. It would also make for broader participation in \r\nCouncil actions, which is critical.\r\nIndonesia, with its strong track record of \r\nadvancing international peace and security and its \r\ncommitment to being an effective peacemaker in the \r\npresent turbulent global environment, with its unique \r\nprofile as the third-largest democracy and the world’s \r\neighth-biggest economy based on purchasing power \r\nparity in 2016, and with its multi-faith and tolerant \r\npeople, has much to offer. It has accordingly presented \r\nits candidature as a non-permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council for the term 2019-2020 and looks \r\nforward to becoming an even more effective enabler of \r\ninternational peace and harmony. As a country that has \r\nproved its global responsibility with regard to others, \r\nhaving been involved in peacekeeping operations \r\nsince 1957, Indonesia is ready and willing to assume \r\nadditional responsibility.\r\nWe recognize that the strong and divergent views \r\nof a number of States on the present categories of \r\nmembership is a key factor hindering progress on \r\nreform. We therefore have expressed support for an \r\nintermediate approach on this issue, as we believe that \r\nan intermediate approach has the potential to garner the \r\nbroadest possible political acceptance and move things \r\nforward. In that regard, my delegation will be willing \r\nto consider all proposals on an intermediate approach \r\nwith an open mind.\r\nIt is vital that we imbue the dialogue process \r\nwith political wisdom and mutual respect to try \r\nto forge greater commonality. The broad support \r\nfavouring a Council code on the use of the veto and \r\nbetter Council working methods exemplifies countries \r\nwith different positions coming together. Progress, \r\nhowever slight in appearance, must be harnessed to \r\nbuild greater understanding on the five key issues. \r\nWe reaffirm the importance of decision 62/557 in \r\nhighlighting five key reform issues, which we should \r\naddress comprehensively, and we believe that no \r\nopportunity for making progress, however meagre, \r\nshould be squandered. We should immediately start the \r\nreform process.\r\nIndonesia will continue to play its role actively and \r\nwill work with all delegations to help advance practical \r\napproaches for Council reform that is meaningful and \r\nenjoys the broadest possible political acceptance. Much \r\nis at stake and reform is needed if our Organization is \r\nto remain relevant.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.15 p.m.\r\n"
