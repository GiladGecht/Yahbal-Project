"United Nations A/71/PV.43\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n43rd plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 7 November 2016, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Mnatsakanyan \r\n(Armenia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 122 (continued)\r\nQuestion of equitable representation on and \r\nincrease in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council\r\nMrs. Chartsuwan (Thailand): Over the past few \r\ndecades, during which we have witnessed significant \r\ndevelopments in terms of the challenges faced by \r\ncountries around the world, from climate change to \r\ntransnational acts of violence, Member States have \r\nrelentlessly engaged in coordinated attempts to keep \r\nthe international Organization fit-for-purpose. Those \r\nefforts will not be complete until the Security Council \r\nis reformed in a way that reflects the geopolitical \r\nrealities of the twenty-first century. That endeavour \r\nhas long been and remains an unfinished task of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThailand joins other Member States in that effort \r\nand has been actively engaging in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. We welcome \r\nthe progress made during the latest session of those \r\nnegotiations, in which elements of convergence emerged \r\nfrom the positions and proposals of Member States, \r\nespecially on the relationship between the Council and \r\nthe General Assembly, the size of an enlarged Security \r\nCouncil and the working methods of the Council. Those \r\nelements of convergence serve to inform us of the \r\ndirection that the reform is heading, as well as placing \r\nthe remaining areas of Security Council reform high on \r\nthe agenda for the next round of the negotiations.\r\nI take this opportunity to express my sincere \r\nappreciation to Ms. Sylvie Lucas, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg, for her hard work and \r\ndedication throughout the previous sessions of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We also welcome the \r\nappointment of Mr. Ion Jinga, Permanent Representative \r\nof Romania, and Mr. Mohamed Khaled Khiari, \r\nPermanent Representative of Tunisia, as co-Chairs of \r\nthe upcoming session. On behalf of Thailand, I wish the \r\ntwo co-Chairs every success in the important task that \r\nlies ahead, and pledge my delegation’s full support and \r\ncooperation throughout the process. \r\nAllow me to reiterate Thailand’s position on the \r\nfollowing three key aspects.\r\nFirst, Thailand strongly supports a strengthened \r\npartnership between the Security Council and the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in accordance with full respect \r\nfor their respective functions, authority, powers and \r\ncompetencies, as enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. A coordinated effort between these \r\ntwo principal organs of the United Nations to cooperate \r\nnot only reinforces the work of each body, but, \r\nmore importantly, also enhances the legitimacy and \r\ntransparency of the Security Council. A good example \r\nis the role of the General Assembly in enhancing the \r\ntransparency and inclusiveness of the recent selection \r\nprocess for the post of the Secretary-General. In that \r\nregard, Thailand also welcomes the ongoing practice \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-36737 (E)\r\n*1636737*\r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n2/25 16-36737\r\nof monthly meetings between the Presidents of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council. We support \r\nthe institutionalization of that practice and further \r\nencourage dialogues between the two Presidents on a \r\nregular basis.\r\nSecondly, Thailand firmly believes that the Council \r\nmembership should be expanded to reflect the plurality \r\nand evolving realities of the United Nations membership. \r\nEnhancing the legitimacy and accountability of the \r\nCouncil, as well as strengthening its effectiveness, \r\nis a core objective of Security Council reform. A key \r\nelement in achieving those goals lies in an enlarged \r\nCouncil with equitable geographical representation in \r\nits membership. In line with the view expressed by a \r\nnumber of Member States, Thailand reaffirms its view \r\nthat the size of a reformed Council should be in the \r\nmid-twenties.\r\nIn regard to its working methods, the Security \r\nCouncil should consider, at the earliest opportunity, \r\na comprehensive review of its provisional rules of \r\nprocedure, which were last revised in 1982. At the \r\nsame time, the Council is encouraged to increase its \r\nengagement with non-Council members, particularly \r\non complex issues with a broad impact, in order to \r\nensure the Council’s accessibility and transparency to \r\nthe wider membership. Meanwhile, the focus and the \r\nlimited time available to the Council should be wisely \r\nallocated to interactive consultations, dialogues and \r\nexchanges of views, rather than to lengthy statements.\r\nThirdly, on areas where there are still divergences \r\namong the Member States, Thailand would like to \r\ncontribute its views for the upcoming session of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. On categories of \r\nmembership, we reaffirm our view that an interim \r\ncategory of membership should be introduced, whereby \r\naspiring members could be re-elected immediately for a \r\nsecond term. A review would then be conducted during \r\nor following the second term of the possible expansion \r\nof permanent members based on an established set \r\nof conditions and criteria. That process could help \r\nMember States make an informed decision on the issue. \r\nWe also invite Member States with similar ideas on \r\nan interim category to work together to come up with \r\nconcrete requirements, criteria and parameters.\r\nOn the question of the veto, when casting a negative \r\nvote, permanent members should always explain to the \r\nbroader United Nations membership the rationale for \r\nsuch a decision. Moreover, Thailand supports proposals \r\nto limit the use of the veto in cases involving mass \r\natrocities. Again, the purpose is to ensure accountability \r\nand to enhance the transparency of the Council, which \r\nacts on behalf of all United Nations Members in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security.\r\nThe previous session of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations showed some progress that we have \r\nmade in Security Council reform, and reflected the \r\ncommitment of Member States to the issue. Thailand \r\nreaffirms its readiness to further contribute to future \r\nnegotiations on the reform of the Security Council and \r\nthe reform of the United Nations as a whole.\r\nMs. Agladze (Georgia): At the outset, I would like to \r\nextend my congratulations to Mr. Ion Jinga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, and Mr. Mohamed Khaled \r\nKhiari, Permanent Representative of Tunisia, for their \r\nappointment as the co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform, and wish \r\nthem every success. I assure the co-Chairs of my \r\nMission’s full support and cooperation. I also thank \r\nthe former Chair of the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas, Permanent Representative \r\nof Luxembourg, for her dedicated work.\r\nAlong with other countries and groups of \r\ncountries, Georgia submitted its own proposal on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council, which has been \r\nincluded in the framework document. Our proposal \r\ncovers all five aspects of the reform. We support the \r\nreform of the Security Council in terms of its equitable \r\nrepresentation and enlargement, and the expansion \r\nof both the permanent and non-permanent categories \r\nof membership, which will increase the legitimacy, \r\nauthority and credibility of the Council. Our particular \r\npriority is the allocation of two seats to the Group of \r\nEastern European States, so that we have better regional \r\nrepresentation and parity in the Council. While being \r\nopen to further consultations, at this stage we see the \r\nfuture Security Council as being comprised of up to 25 \r\nmembers.\r\nFurthermore, we stand for the inclusion of \r\nsmaller States in decision-making in order for the \r\nbasic international law principle of sovereign equality \r\nbetween nations to be more explicitly reflected at \r\nthe core of the international security architecture. \r\nHowever, as we have previously noted, we believe \r\nthat equitable representation should not be an end in \r\nitself. A meaningful reform should also imply reform \r\nof the use of the veto, the working methods and the \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 3/25\r\ndecision-making principles of the Security Council, as \r\nwell as greater accountability to the General Assembly. \r\nWe further believe that there must be more openness \r\nin the work of the Council, so that its deliberations are \r\nmade in a more transparent and democratic manner.\r\nWe stand ready to cooperate with the co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations to advance \r\nthat process.\r\nMr. Akbaruddin (India): I wish to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the General Assembly for \r\nreiterating today his commitment to the critical issue \r\nof Security Council reform (see A/71/PV.42). We also \r\nwelcome his efforts to reach out to Member States \r\nso early during the seventy-first session. I would \r\nalso like to congratulate our colleagues, Ambassador \r\nMohamed Khaled Khiari of Tunisia and Ambassador \r\nIon Jinga of Romania, who have been entrusted with \r\nthe responsibility to co-chair our discussions. I wish \r\nthem success in that important task and pledge my \r\ndelegation’s full support for their work.\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statements made \r\nby the representative of St. Lucia on behalf of the L.69 \r\ngroup of developing countries and by the representative \r\nof Germany on behalf of the Group of Four (see A/71/\r\nPV.42). In addition, I would like to highlight a few other \r\nissues in my national capacity.\r\nMany times, the cause of human suffering is our \r\nhabit of attending to urgent tasks at the cost of important \r\nones. The never-ending carousel of discussions on \r\nSecurity Council reforms leaves many of us perplexed, \r\nas actual crucial reform of the Security Council has been \r\ndelayed, despite both its importance and its urgency. I \r\nwould be preaching to the converted if I were to talk \r\nabout the importance of the matter. There is, however, \r\nmuch more to say and ponder concerning the urgency \r\nof the issue and the costs of our inaction. One needs \r\nonly to look at some of the Council’s decisions or lack \r\nof decisions on crucial issues of global importance. The \r\ninability to respond to humanitarian situations, terrorist \r\nthreats and peacekeeping vulnerabilities during this \r\npast year is part of the price that is being paid for our \r\nlack of progress on this critical matter.\r\nThe global governance structure for addressing \r\nissues of international peace and security, which we \r\ninherited in 1945, does not cease to surprise us with its \r\npersistent inability to effectively engage with the tasks \r\nat hand. On some issues pivotal to international security, \r\nsuch as Syria, we see inaction. On other situations, \r\nsuch as the peacekeeping crisis in South Sudan, we \r\nsee fragmented action that is not implemented even \r\nmonths after it was agreed upon. While our collective \r\nconscience is ravaged every day by terrorists in some \r\nregion or another, the Security Council took nine \r\nmonths to consider whether to sanction leaders of \r\nterrorist organizations that it has itself designated as \r\nterrorist entities. \r\nThe Security Council is stuck in its own time \r\nwarp and politics. It can only be described as working \r\nrandomly on the basis of a mix of adhoc-ism, scrambling \r\nand political paralysis. Need one say more about the \r\nurgency of the need for the reform of that relic that has \r\nlong been unresponsive to the needs of our time? The \r\nlack of representation in its membership — especially \r\nin the permanent category, which was decided 70 years \r\nago  — increases its lack of legitimacy and credibility.\r\nSignificant work was accomplished in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations during the past two \r\nsessions, especially in working towards a text during the \r\nsixty-ninth session of the General Assembly, under the \r\nstewardship of Ambassador Rattray. We are therefore \r\nhappy that the President of the General Assembly today \r\ncalled on all Member States to engage with greater \r\nf lexibility in a process leading to substantive results. \r\nAs they say, get the process in place and all good things \r\nwill follow. We are hopeful that such a process will be \r\nput in place — a process that we can perhaps take the \r\nliberty of calling the Thomson process. Hopefully, the \r\nThomson process can help us move from discussions \r\nto negotiations under the stewardship of the co-Chairs.\r\nFor that to happen, it is normal practice to provide \r\nfor a text. That will help us to understand the prospects \r\nfor convergence on all issues, as well as delineating \r\nthe areas of divergence. That is the practice that has \r\nbeen adopted in all intergovernmental negotiations \r\nin the General Assembly. It will clarify our thoughts, \r\nfocus on all issues and help us to understand in an \r\nopen, transparent and comprehensive manner the \r\ncorrect picture of the current situation. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome the newly founded group of friends on \r\nSecurity Council reform as a move to reach beyond \r\nlong-established groups from various regions. India \r\nhas joined that group. We hope it will work together \r\nwith the aim of accelerating the negotiating process for \r\na meaningful reform of the Council, based on agreed \r\nobjectives. We encourage other Member States to join \r\nthe Group.\r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n4/25 16-36737\r\nIt is time to break the impasse. It is time to reflect \r\nthe different views in a text, so that everyone can \r\ndiscern the trend lines and the trajectory of the thinking \r\nof Member States. In that manner, we can collectively \r\ndo justice to both the urgency and the importance of the \r\ntask of Security Council reform before us.\r\nMr. Sevilla Borja (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThere is no higher priority in the work of the \r\nAssembly than that of reforming the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, especially with respect to making \r\nthe necessary changes in the structure and working \r\nmethods of the Security Council. That is also true of \r\nthe relationship between the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council. Regrettably, little progress has been \r\nmade over the past long 20 years since we began to \r\nput forth proposals and negotiate issues relating to the \r\nsubject. The process is eminently political and must be \r\ndealt with at the highest political levels when we make \r\nsuch decisions among States.\r\nAt present, we believe that we must not focus just \r\non procedural issues, on negotiations on details of \r\nlanguage, nor on participation quotas or the number of \r\npermanent or non-permanent members. This matter has \r\nto do with something more substantial: a contemporary \r\nreading of history and the political will to realistically \r\nand courageously confront the complex challenges of \r\ntoday’s international agenda.\r\nNow is the right time to equip the Organization \r\nto uphold the responsibility that it was charged with \r\nby the peoples of the world in 1945, after the global \r\nconflagration. We have passed the zenith of the 70 \r\nyears since  the signing of the San Francisco Charter. \r\nAfter long and complex negotiations, the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development was adopted, with its 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals. In Addis Ababa, the \r\nAction Agenda of the Third International Conference \r\non Financing for Development was approved. In Paris, \r\na plan to fight climate change was agreed on. And \r\nwith no opposing vote, we just adopted resolution \r\n71/5, condemning the embargo against Cuba, one of \r\nthe remaining vestiges of the Cold War. Last month \r\nin Quito, the New Urban Agenda for the Twenty-first \r\nCentury was adopted, and just 10 days ago the First \r\nCommittee adopted a draft resolution on convening \r\na conference to negotiate a binding treaty to prohibit \r\nnuclear weapons, thus beginning the democratization \r\nof disarmament as well. On 1 January 2017, a new \r\nSecretary-General, in whom we place high hopes, will \r\nbegin his term.\r\nAfter 20 years with no major successes on Security \r\nCouncil reform, there can now be a fresh start, given \r\nthat, as I just said, there are objective conditions for \r\nthe Organization to make progress on comprehensive \r\nreform of the Council that would make it possible to \r\nfulfil two basic principles: its modernization and \r\nits democratization. Modernization, because the \r\nDumbarton Oaks Conference in 1944 and the Yalta \r\nConference in February of 1945 — which gave rise to \r\nthe current Article 27 of the Charter — consecrated \r\nthe realities of the exercise of power and the dynamics \r\nof international politics as they existed at the time. \r\nWithout the veto, the Organization could probably not \r\nhave come into being or survived, especially during the \r\ntumultuous times of the East-West confrontation.\r\nBut today, now that the Cold War is behind us, a new \r\nera has begun in the real functioning of the international \r\ncommunity, which has its legal organization in the \r\nUnited Nations. A new situation in international \r\nrelations has been created with the incorporation of \r\nStates that were not among the original signatories \r\nof the Charter. We are living in a time of searches \r\nfor consensus, of patient negotiations with a view to \r\nreaching shared positions in the Security Council, the \r\nonly body that can approve the legitimate use of force. \r\nToday, in this new stage, we believe that it is possible to \r\nfind creative and imaginative alternatives to overcome \r\nthe undemocratic institution of the veto, which is, as I \r\nhave stated, a remnant of the past.\r\nThat leads us to the second principle of our vision \r\nof change: democratization. Let us recall that the first \r\nis modernization. We cannot continue to allow there \r\nto be first-class and second-class States. We cannot \r\nimprove the overall functioning of the Security Council \r\nby giving more States the veto. We must instead employ \r\nnew working methods, incorporating States from those \r\ngroups that are inadequately represented and striking \r\na balance in the relationship between the Security \r\nCouncil and the General Assembly.\r\nWe must aspire to a Security Council that is \r\nmore democratic in its membership and in its actions \r\nby increasing the number of members, making the \r\ndecision-making process transparent within the limits \r\nof the powers conferred on that organ by the Charter, \r\nworking to eliminate the anachronistic right of the \r\nveto and revitalizing the role of the General Assembly \r\nas the sole body in the United Nations with universal \r\nmembership.\r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 5/25\r\nTo conclude, Ecuador reiterates that the main \r\nchallenge before us is reform of the Security Council that \r\nis based on its modernization and its democratization. \r\nFurthermore, with a view to progressing towards that \r\nideal, we must involve the highest political level of \r\nGovernments. Secretary-General-designate António \r\nGuterres can play an important role in creating \r\nmomentum towards achieving that goal, thereby \r\novercoming the past 20 years of frustrated efforts.\r\nMr. Mažeiks (Latvia): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this debate. At the 2005 World Summit, \r\nworld leaders acknowledged that we are living in an \r\ninterdependent and global world and that many of \r\ntoday’s threats recognize no national boundaries and \r\nare interlinked. There was strong determination to \r\ntackle the threats at a global level by adapting the \r\nintergovernmental organs of the United Nations to the \r\nneeds of the twenty-first century. Unfortunately, calls \r\nfor an early reform of the Security Council aimed at \r\nmaking it more representative, efficient and transparent, \r\nthus enhancing its effectiveness and the legitimacy of \r\nits decisions, have not been answered.\r\nFurthermore, far too often, the Security Council, \r\nwhich bears the primary responsibility to ensure \r\ninternational peace and security, has been unable to \r\nprevent conflicts or build peace or stop atrocities. Latvia \r\nbelieves that the United Nations capacity to address the \r\ncurrent challenges also depends on the political will to \r\nmove forward with Security Council reform. That is \r\nlong overdue, and we should all aim at strengthening \r\nthe legitimacy of that important body.\r\nThat legitimacy very much depends on the actions \r\nof the Security Council. Blocking the work of the \r\nCouncil, especially in matters related to mass atrocities, \r\nis unacceptable. We believe that discussions on limiting \r\nthe use of the veto in certain circumstances should be \r\ncontinued. If the Council is to react accordingly, its \r\npermanent members should refrain from using the \r\nveto in situations of atrocity crimes. Latvia supports \r\nthat important initiative, as well as the code of conduct \r\nregarding Security Council action against genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes. We also \r\nsupport improvement of the Council’s working methods \r\nwith a view to increasing transparency, inclusiveness \r\nand representativeness in its work, thus enhancing \r\nits legitimacy and facilitating the implementation of \r\nits decisions.\r\nIn our view, Council reform should ensure \r\nequitable geographic distribution of both permanent \r\nand non-permanent seats, thereby reflecting the current \r\npolitical realities. That would include allocating at \r\nleast one additional non-permanent seat to the Group \r\nof Eastern European States. Due consideration should \r\nalso be given to the adequate representation of small \r\nand medium-sized Member States.\r\nLatvia believes that in order to advance Security \r\nCouncil reform, we should go beyond merely reiterating \r\npositions. It is important to find a way to ensure text-\r\nbased negotiations. As in other negotiation processes at \r\nthe United Nations, the Chair of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform has a mandate \r\nto actively steer the discussions with a view to producing \r\nconcrete results. That would also include a proposal \r\nfor a negotiation text. The final decision on a possible \r\ntext would be taken by Member States as a result of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations.\r\nWe note that some progress was achieved during \r\nthe past two sessions of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, which is encouraging. First, there was \r\nthe 2015 framework document on Security Council \r\nreform, which reflects the positions of more than half \r\nof the United Nations membership. During the previous \r\nsession, another small step forward was made in the form \r\nof elements of convergence covering some aspects of the \r\nreform. We appreciate the efforts in that regard of the \r\nformer Chairs of the negotiations, Ambassador Rattray \r\nof Jamaica and Ambassador Lucas of Luxembourg, as \r\nwell as the strong support of the former and the current \r\nPresidents of the General Assembly.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the decision of the \r\nPresident to appoint Mr. Ion Jinga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, and Mr. Mohamed Khiari, \r\nPermanent Representative of Tunisia, as co-Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations. Latvia extends its \r\nsupport to both co-Chairs, and is committed to working \r\nwith them and with other Member States in order to \r\nfacilitate work on the reform.\r\nWe should ensure that the realities and demands of \r\nthe twenty-first century are reflected in the progress \r\nachieved on Security Council reform. It is time to \r\nmove forward and to achieve a concrete outcome in \r\nthat process.\r\nMr. Ndong Mba (Equatorial Guinea) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): This is the first time that I have taken the f loor \r\nfrom this rostrum since the election of the President \r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n6/25 16-36737\r\nof the General Assembly for the seventy-first session. \r\nAllow me to express my sincere congratulations and \r\nappreciation to the President on the effective manner \r\nin which he has been conducting the debates. We also \r\nwant to thank him for convening this plenary meeting \r\nto discuss the question of equitable representation on \r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council \r\nand other matters related to the Security Council.\r\nLet me also congratulate Ambassador Ion \r\nJinga, Permanent Representative of Romania, and \r\nAmbassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia, on their appointment as \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform. My delegation expresses its \r\nfull support and pledges close cooperation with them \r\nthroughout their exercise.\r\nThis is a very timely debate. We hope that Security \r\nCouncil reform will acquire new momentum in the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. We hope that we can \r\nconclude that process, which has now been going for \r\ndecades, ever since we began the debate on equitable \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council and the \r\nincrease in its membership during thirtieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly in 1979. That was done at the \r\nrequest of Algeria, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bhutan, \r\nGuyana, India, Maldives, Nepal, Nigeria and Sri \r\nLanka. It was not until 1992 that the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 47/62, in accordance with which the \r\nSecretary-General published a report containing the \r\nobservations by Member States (A/48/264).\r\nWe are now approaching the end of 2016, so it is \r\nappropriate for the international Organization, the \r\nUnited Nations, through its General Assembly, to \r\nprovide encouragement so that in 2017, when the United \r\nNations turns 72 years old, this long process will lead \r\nto the effective reform of the Security Council. It \r\nmight seem inconceivable that, ever since the United \r\nNations began to promote respect for human rights and \r\nsociopolitical and economic reform, and ever since it \r\nbegan promoting democracy, good governance and \r\ntransparency reforms — many developing countries \r\nhave been engaged in such reforms, including my own \r\ncountry, Equatorial Guinea — the United Nations itself \r\nhas, for more than 20 years, been incapable of actually \r\ncompleting such reforms.\r\nI am participating in this debate as the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Equatorial Guinea, which is a State \r\nmember of the African Union Committee of Ten Heads \r\nof State (C-10). For that reason, I completely support \r\nthe statement made by the Permanent Representative of \r\nSierra Leone, Mr. Foday Sumah, as coordinator of the \r\nC-10. He reaffirmed the claims of the African continent \r\nto be fully and widely represented in all decision-making \r\nbodies of the United Nations — particularly the Security \r\nCouncil, which is the principal decision-making body \r\nrelated to international peace and security. That full and \r\nwide representation that the African continent requires \r\ntwo permanent seats with all the inherent privileges \r\nand prerogatives, and five non-permanent seats in the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nA society or organization that is not dynamic is \r\ndoomed to disappear. Because the United Nations \r\nis a vital organization for the sustainability of the \r\ncommunity of nations and of global causes, my \r\ndelegation repeats that the time has come for the reform \r\nand modernization of the Organization in general and \r\nthe Security Council in particular so as to meet the \r\nrequirements of the world today and in the future.\r\nThe General Assembly debate on Security Council \r\nreform has already taken too long. My delegation, as \r\na member of the Committee of Ten and the Group of \r\nAfrican States, has been consistently and continuously \r\ncalled for reforms that represent the political, social \r\nand economic changes of the world today. Members \r\nwill agree with me that it is totally inconceivable and \r\nunjustifiable that a continent such as Africa — which \r\nhas more than 1 billion people and 54 States Members \r\nof the United Nations and whose problems make up \r\nmore than 70 per cent of the issues on the agenda of \r\nthe Security Council — does not yet have a single \r\npermanent seat in that organ.\r\nIn that regard, it should be noted that the demand for \r\nseats for Africa in the Security Council is a requirement, \r\nan inalienable right in the modern world, especially in \r\na world organization like the United Nations, which is \r\nsupposed to guarantee the principles of justice, good \r\ngovernance and rights. \r\nMy country reaffirms its position, which is the \r\nCommon African Position, which rejects any provisional \r\nor transitional proposals in the negotiations, given that \r\nthe main provisions of those proposals run counter to \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea expresses its \r\nfull confidence in His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\nPresident of the General Assembly, and the new \r\nco-Chairs, Ambassador Ion Jinga and Ambassador \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 7/25\r\nMohamed Khaled Khiari, as they guide the process of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations for Security Council \r\nreform, as well as in all the partners, friends and allies \r\nof Africa from all regions and continents, that they will \r\ncontinue to grant us their support, which is steadily \r\nincreasing, so that our just African claim can translate \r\ninto a tangible reality.\r\nMy country, its President — His Excellency Obiang \r\nNguema Mbasogo — and its Government consider in a \r\ngeneral way that all States, regions and interest groups \r\nare called on to focus their positions in the framework \r\nof the negotiating process for Security Council reform \r\nso as to reach an equitable representation, an increase \r\nin the number of its members in both categories in \r\norder to achieve an objective and impartial reform of \r\nthe Security Council and of the United Nations system. \r\nThat is our wish, our desire for the restructuring of the \r\nSecurity Council in particular and the United Nations \r\nsystem in general, in a manner that takes into account \r\nthe interests of all the States and geographical regions \r\nthat define the international community in its broadest \r\nsense. That means that all States must continue \r\nadvancing and overcoming the unnecessary obstacles \r\nthat do not in any way enable genuine reform and a \r\nmore representative Security Council.\r\nThe world currently faces numerous challenges \r\nand threats, including armed conflicts, terrorism, \r\nclimate change, piracy, illegal arms trafficking, \r\nhuman trafficking, organized crime, diseases and so \r\non. Tackling all of those challenges requires a greater \r\ninvolvement of States through broader representation \r\nof States Members of the United Nations in its \r\ndecision-making bodies. That is possible only if we have \r\nreform of the Security Council, as demanded today by \r\nan increasingly large number of Member States.\r\nMr. Balé (Congo) (spoke in French): At the outset, \r\nthe Congo wishes to associate itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Sierra Leone on behalf \r\nof the Group of African States (see A/71/PV.42). I would \r\nlike to add a few comments in my national capacity.\r\nI wish to join earlier speakers in expressing our \r\ncongratulations to the President on his leadership of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this seventy-first session. At the \r\nsame time, I thank him for organizing this meeting on \r\nthe question of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and other \r\nmatters related to the Security Council, which is known \r\nas Security Council reform.\r\nI also wish to address my sincere congratulations \r\nto the Permanent Representatives of Tunisia and \r\nRomania, who have been designated co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. It is their sensitive mission to infuse new \r\nenergy into that process and to engage in a new start. I \r\ncan assure them of my delegation’s support. I seize this \r\noccasion to pay well-merited tribute to all their eminent \r\npredecessors, who did their best and invested so much \r\nenergy in the laborious and complex negotiation \r\nprocess over the seven years since its launch in 2009. It \r\nis thanks to their tenacity and their contributions that \r\nwe can hope for a possible epilogue.\r\nThe adoption on 27 July of decision 70/559, on \r\nthe follow-up to the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nat the current session contributes to the efforts of \r\nour colleagues, as has been mentioned, and to the \r\ncommitment of Member States to continuing to work for \r\nSecurity Council reform in the spirit of transparency, \r\nopenness and compromise, despite obvious differences \r\nand harmful divisions. My delegation bases its hopes on \r\nthe framework document of 31 July 2015 and its annex, \r\nwhich define the path forward. In that regard, I call for \r\nthe speedy establishment of an open-ended working \r\ngroup to consider the strategies to be implemented in \r\norder to quickly engage in the substantive debate on \r\nthat crucial issue.\r\nMy delegation appreciates the President’s \r\ncommitment to conducting negotiations on the basis \r\nof decision 62/557, which the General Assembly \r\nadopted on 15 September 2008. That decision forms \r\nthe basis for the intergovernmental negotiations and \r\nthe recommendations on the interdependence of the \r\nfive thematic groups in Security Council reform. It is \r\ntherefore appropriate to remember that we should not \r\ninvest in a quest for a makeshift, fragmented approach, \r\nwhich would be contrary to the spirit and letter of \r\nthe decision.\r\nThe reform that we are calling for is a historic \r\nprerequisite for the advent of a more just world, based \r\non universalism, equity and balance among the regions \r\nof the world. To that end, we need to explore all paths \r\nthat guide us towards a genuine, more realistic reform \r\nthat espouses the values, goals and ideals of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. It is more than timely to open \r\nsubstantive negotiations on the basis of a text that \r\nenables us to identify the points in common and engage \r\nin a real process of compromise.\r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n8/25 16-36737\r\nI remind members that it has been barely a month \r\nsince the General Assembly witnessed the confirmation \r\nof a unanimous choice from among the 13 candidates \r\nfor the post of Secretary-General, following a process \r\nof unprecedented transparency. That feat in the life \r\nof our Organization, which we have all applauded, \r\nhas refuted the most pessimistic predictions. Here, \r\npolitical will provided genuine motivation for a historic \r\ncompromise, which appears to herald a new era and \r\nmarks the beginning of a historic turning point in the \r\nexistence of the United Nations.\r\nThe Congo has not lost hope for a reformed Security \r\nCouncil in the short or medium term. The dynamic \r\nprovided by the process of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations in recent years gives reason to believe that \r\nobstacles can be gradually removed. But, as was evident \r\nin the nomination process for the Secretary-General, \r\nthe approach requires, above and beyond a simple \r\ndeclaration of faith, a real political will for genuine \r\nreform so that that important organ is more democratic \r\nand more representative, and with greater transparency, \r\neffectiveness and accountability to Member States. \r\nNon-reform of the Security Council in the short \r\nand medium terms cannot be an option. We cannot \r\nentertain such a scenario. Such a perspective would \r\nno longer satisfy the demands of justice or present \r\ncircumstances, much less Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 16, on promoting peaceful and inclusive societies. \r\nThe implementation of that Goal depends, inter alia, \r\non broadening and strengthening the participation \r\nof developing countries in the institutions of global \r\ngovernance and on developing effective, accountable \r\nand transparent institutions at all levels — to mention \r\nonly two requirements set forth in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. \r\nReform of the United Nations remains a demand \r\nfor adaptation, modernization, democratization and \r\ntransparency, which would enable the Organization to \r\nestablish its historical leadership in global governance. \r\nReform of the Security Council — the cornerstone \r\nof the United Nations — cannot be exempt from \r\nthat imperative.\r\nIn that context, it seems only fair and just to \r\nsatisfy the legitimate demand to redress the historical \r\ninjustice done to Africa. It is indeed a known fact that \r\nissues concerning Africa account for more than 60 per \r\ncent of the items on the Security Council’s agenda. \r\nBut that type of calculation cannot overshadow the \r\nlegitimate aspiration of 54 States, which account for \r\napproximately a quarter of the United Nations Member \r\nStates, to shoulder their due share of responsibility in \r\nthe area of international peace and security.\r\nMr. Kim In-ryong (Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea): Today, the role of the Security Council is \r\ncrucial in carrying out the mission of the United Nations, \r\nwhich is to ensure international peace and security. In \r\nmany parts of the world, events posing grave threats \r\nto peace and security and the existence of humankind \r\ncontinue to unfold, indicating thereby that the Security \r\nCouncil is not addressing them adequately.\r\nThe Korean peninsula is faced with a situation in \r\nwhich acute and worsened tensions are driving it to the \r\nbrink of war. No one knows whether a nuclear war might \r\nbreak out owing to the increased level of unprecedented \r\npolitical, military and economic isolation and pressure \r\nexerted by the so-called super-Power, the United States \r\nof America, which seeks to stif le a sovereign State that \r\nis striving to maintain its dignity.\r\nEvery year, the United States of America conducts \r\na number of large-scale joint military exercises geared \r\ntowards a preemptive nuclear strike, thereby escalating \r\nthe military threat against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. This year, unsatisfied with the \r\nongoing massive deployment in South Korea of various \r\nkinds of nuclear strategic assets, including nuclear \r\nbombers and submarines, the United States, using the \r\npretext of military exercises, went one step further by \r\ndeploying the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense \r\nsystem in South Korea.\r\nIn the exercise of its right as a United Nations \r\nMember State and as provided for in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea has requested the Security Council on several \r\noccasions to hold an emergency meeting on the \r\naggressive and provocative large-scale joint military \r\nexercises being conducted by the United States and \r\nSouth Korea, undermining international peace and \r\nsecurity. However, the Security Council has remained \r\nsteadfastly silent towards each request, even when it \r\nwas faced with the stark reality of the possibility of \r\nnuclear war breaking out on the Korean peninsula and \r\nengulfing both it and the world as a whole.\r\nThat is not the only issue to be raised. According \r\nto the Charter, the Security Council is supposed to \r\naddress all situations in which international peace and \r\nsecurity are breached or where such a threat exists. \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 9/25\r\nHowever, the Council has determined that only the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s nuclear test \r\nand its peaceful satellite launch count as threats to \r\ninternational peace and security. It therefore adopted \r\nresolution 2270 (2016), which calls for the prohibition \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic’s aforementioned \r\nactions and a follow-up that would impose abundant \r\nsanctions in response to to any self-defensive counter-\r\nmeasures that our country might take, which would be \r\njustified, supposedly, under the pretext of some alleged \r\nviolation of resolution 2270 (2016).\r\nNowhere in the Charter or international law can \r\nwe find a single provision stipulating that nuclear tests \r\nor satellite launches constitute a threat to international \r\npeace and security or any single provision stipulating \r\nthat only specific countries have the right to conduct \r\nnuclear tests and satellite launches. The so-called \r\nsanctions resolutions adopted by the Security Council \r\nagainst the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nclearly indicate, therefore, that the Council is being \r\nmanipulated in the interest of the political goals of a \r\nsingle permanent member. We can only consider that to \r\nbe an abuse of power and a perversion of the Charter.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nofficially requested the Secretariat to clarify the \r\nlegitimacy of resolution 2270 (2016), but the Secretariat \r\nhas yet to reply. The Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea is the only country in the world that has lived \r\nunder the imminent threat of United States nuclear \r\nweapons for more than 50 years. The Security Council \r\nhas therefore no legal or moral ground to stand on when \r\nit takes issue with our nuclear programme, which is a \r\nnecessary deterrent to nuclear war and safeguards our \r\ncountry’s people and our right to exist. The United \r\nStates, as a permanent members of the Security Council, \r\ncontinues to misuse the Council as an instrument in \r\nits efforts to strictly pursue its political and military \r\npurposes and strategic interests, which is a serious \r\nissue facing the United Nations today.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea calls for the Security Council’s comprehensive \r\nreform so as to reflect today’s demands. It  outlines its \r\nprincipled position as follows. \r\nFirst, Council reform should be directed towards \r\nensuring impartiality, objectivity and democracy. \r\nAlthough more than 70 years have passed since the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations, the Security \r\nCouncil, which consists of only 15 States, is unable \r\nto represent the interests of all 193 Member States. \r\nSecurity Council reform should be undertaken with a \r\nview to rejecting the high-handedness, arbitrariness \r\nand double standards of one specific country, which \r\nmust be considered to be a blatant violation of the \r\npurposes and principles of the Charter, which proclaims \r\nthe sovereignty and equality of all countries.\r\nSecondly, the composition of the Council should be \r\nbased on the principle of ensuring the full representation \r\nof member States of the Non-Aligned Movement and \r\nother developing countries. Since such States form \r\nthe majority of the membership of the United Nations, \r\nit cannot be a matter of debate that they should be \r\nrepresented accordingly in the Security Council. As \r\nwe have seen during the intergovernmental negotiation \r\nprocess on Security Council reform, the prospects for \r\nenlarging the Council’s permanent membership are not \r\ngood, owing to the seriously divided views of Member \r\nStates. Under those circumstances, a preferable and \r\nviable solution for redressing the Council’s unbalanced \r\nstructure would be to begin by enlarging the category \r\nof non-permanent members.\r\nThirdly, the delegation of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea believes that Japan’s efforts to \r\nbecome a permanent member of the Security Council \r\nare an affront to the conscience of humankind and the \r\nUnited Nations. A country notorious for its war crimes, \r\nJapan invaded numerous Asian countries, committed \r\nthe wholesale slaughter of peoples, looted and set \r\nfires indiscriminately, and, in particular, committed \r\nthe crime of sex slavery, which is an egregious crime \r\nagainst humanity. Before participating in negotiations \r\non Security Council reform, Japan should reflect upon \r\nits crimes and compensate the victims in good faith in \r\norder to regain the trust of the international community.\r\nThe delegation of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea has clarified its principal position on Security \r\nCouncil reform and has expressed the hope that the \r\nsincere and protracted efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to achieve such reform will bear fruit and \r\nproduce successful results.\r\nMr. Ružička (Slovakia): At the outset, I wish to thank \r\nthe President for convening this meeting. Let me begin \r\nby congratulating Ambassador Ion Jinga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, and Ambassador Mohamed \r\nKhiari, Permanent Representative of Tunisia, on their \r\nappointment as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform. But we should \r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n10/25 16-36737\r\ngo farther than congratulating them; by electing, \r\nselecting and approving them, we give them full power \r\nand our trust and confidence in their ability to guide \r\nus through the very complex process of the talks and \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reforms. I would like \r\nto assure them of my country’s support and cooperation \r\nwith regard to the steps and decisions that they will \r\npresent to all of us.\r\nSecurity Council reform is an essential part of the \r\ncomprehensive reform of the United Nations. Everybody \r\nagrees on the principle that the Organization and all \r\nits bodies should represent the world’s contemporary \r\nrealities. Let me just quote some trivial numbers that \r\ncan be found in Wikipedia or on Google-retrieved \r\nwebsites. In 1945, there were 51 Member States; in \r\n1965, when the last significant reform of the Security \r\nCouncil took place, there were 117 Member States; and \r\nin 1992 we started negotiating again. I wish to remind \r\neveryone that in 1965, when my generation of diplomats \r\nwas born, there was very little progress towards reform. \r\nIn 1992, a new generation of diplomats — many of \r\nthem are sitting here — arrived on the global scene. In \r\n2000, the younger generation — we are talking about \r\nthe millennials — was really unsure that we were ready \r\nand able to establish a system of international relations \r\nthat would reflect the realities of the current world.\r\nIf there is the will, there is a way. We do not have \r\nto look very far for an example. Only recently, we \r\nwere able to make significant progress in the process \r\nof selecting the head of this Organization. Three years \r\nago, nobody was optimistic or expecting that outcome. \r\nBut it took time, it took negotiating skills, and it took \r\nthe will and readiness of all Member States — large \r\nand small, northern and southern countries — to agree \r\non the principle. And recently we succeeded in electing \r\na new Secretary-General who has the full trust of \r\nthe Member States. The election was based on a real \r\ncompetition with greater transparency and with the full \r\nparticipation of all Member States. We have to continue \r\nin our endeavours.\r\nWe welcome the intensified reform efforts during \r\nthe two previous General Assembly sessions. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to thank both Chairs of the \r\nintergovenmental negotiations, Ambassador Sylvie \r\nLucas, Permanent Representative of Luxembourg, \r\nand Ambassador Courtenay Rattray, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Jamaica. They gave the process their \r\nbest efforts. Of course, there were different approaches \r\nand points of view in what they did, but they did try. If \r\nwe do not try, we should not be here.\r\nThe position of my country is quite well \r\ndocumented. Let me just briefly recapitulate its main \r\nelements. We would like the Security Council to be \r\nmuch more representative and transparent, but also \r\neffective and efficient. That in itself is a huge task \r\nand challenge. There are various models for how to \r\ntackle it, starting with those presented by the former \r\nSecretaries-General, by the former negotiators, and by \r\nmany countries and groups that have already taken the \r\nf loor. We think that the nucleus of a future compromise \r\nis contained in those ideas. What we have to do is to try \r\nto put all those views together and look at them from \r\nthe viewpoint of the interests of humankind and the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMy country supports the expansion of both categories \r\nof membership, permanent and non-permanent, and we \r\nare also very keen to discuss the possibility of a third \r\ntype of membership, provided that it meets two goals, \r\nnamely, representation and efficiency. \r\nMembership in the Security Council, especially \r\npermanent membership, is not only a privilege, but also, \r\nand more importantly, a responsibility. The majority of \r\nour Member States have already been Security Council \r\nmembers. We took our membership as a responsibility. \r\nIt was not our goal to get into the Security Council; \r\nthe goal was to contribute to solving the most serious \r\nissues of the day.\r\nWe support the enlargement of the Council and call \r\nfor better representation therein of the Group of African \r\nStates and for an additional non-permanent seat for the \r\nGroup of Eastern European States. \r\nTaking all the pluses and minuses into account, we \r\nshould be more attentive to the voices of the small and \r\nmedium-sized Member States, because in the overall \r\ncompetition they are sometimes at a disadvantage in \r\ncompeting for a seat. So we have to find the appropriate \r\nmechanisms. The majority of new Member States since \r\n1990 are small Member States. One might ask, what \r\nis their contribution? My answer is simple. We have \r\nrepresentatives of every single Member State in the \r\nhighest positions in the United Nations system, and we \r\nvery much value and appreciate their contributions to \r\nthe work of the system.\r\nThe right of veto granted to the permanent members \r\nof the Council is a prerogative enshrined in the Charter \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 11/25\r\nof the United Nations. Nevertheless, Slovakia has \r\nendorsed the major initiatives to promote a culture of \r\nzero tolerance at the United Nations in mass atrocity \r\nsituations, and that effort should continue. Furthermore, \r\nwe welcome the positive movement towards improving \r\nthe Council’s relationships with other United Nations \r\nbodies, such as the General Assembly, the Secretariat, \r\nthe Peacebuilding Commission and regional \r\norganizations. Those efforts should also be pursued.\r\nThe last point of our position is that over the past two \r\nto three years, several non-permanent Council members \r\nhave demonstrated that there is room for improvement \r\nin the working methods of the Council, inter alia, by \r\nmaking them more transparent and more informative \r\nand by finding ways of keeping non-members informed \r\nof the Council’s proceedings.\r\nMy delegation looks forward to engaging in open, \r\ntransparent, inclusive and results-oriented negotiations \r\nwith a view to moving the process forward during the \r\nAssembly’s current session. We are ready to move that \r\nprocess forward. As the Chinese philosopher says, \r\n“Every long journey starts with small steps”, and we \r\nshould have the courage to take them.\r\nMr. Vitrenko (Ukraine): I thank the President for \r\nconvening today’s debate.\r\nUkraine believes that efforts to make the Security \r\nCouncil more representative and balanced and its work \r\nmore effective and transparent, especially with regard \r\nto decision-making, are vital in getting the United \r\nNations to adapt to the global realities of the twenty-\r\nfirst century. Ukraine considers both directions of \r\nreform — the enlargement of the Security Council and \r\nthe improvement of its working methods — to be a high \r\npriority. Achieving progress in those spheres will meet \r\nthe interests of Ukraine.\r\nAs a current elected member of the Council, \r\nUkraine participates actively in the deliberations of its \r\nmembers aimed at making that organ more efficient \r\nand transparent. For instance, one could see very \r\npositive developments during the selection process \r\nfor the Secretary-General this year. Yet that process \r\nneeds further improvement in order to become truly \r\ntransparent and inclusive. Furthermore, in July, at \r\nthe initiative of the elected members of the Council, \r\nan important note by the President of the Council \r\n(S/2016/619) was adopted with a view to facilitating \r\nthe accession of newly elected members to the Council \r\nand to selecting members in a more transparent and \r\ninclusive manner to chair the Council’s subsidiary \r\nbodies. Even though the implementation of that note has \r\nbeen uneven thus far, we are sure that its provisions will \r\nhave a far-reaching, positive impact on the work of the \r\nCouncil. During our Council term, we will cooperate \r\nwith all of its members so as to further streamline its \r\nwork, including by updating the well-known note by \r\nthe President in document S/2010/507.\r\nWhile Ukraine is open to discussing all new \r\napproaches to Security Council reform, we particularly \r\nwelcome initiatives aimed at streamlining the \r\nnegotiation process and making it more pragmatic \r\nand results-oriented. In that regard, we are grateful to \r\nAmbassador Sylvie Lucas for preparing the outcome \r\ndocument of our deliberations in the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations during the previous General Assembly \r\nsession, showing a number of points of convergence \r\nin the positions of Member States. We hope that the \r\nelement of transparency that she brought to the debate \r\nwill be preserved.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the appointment of the \r\nAmbassadors of Romania and Tunisia as the new \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations. They \r\ncan certainly count on my delegation’s full support. \r\nWe are ready to participate actively in the negotiations \r\nduring the current General Assembly session. Ukraine \r\nsupports all steps, whether procedural or substantive, \r\nthat can lead to progress in that area, which is long \r\noverdue. We are convinced that the proposals and \r\npositions reflected in the framework document \r\ncirculated on 31 July 2015 continue to constitute a \r\nsolid basis for further negotiations. As for the Group \r\nof Eastern European States, I would like to underline \r\nthat any increase in the non-permanent membership \r\nof the Security Council should ensure enhanced \r\nrepresentation of the Eastern European States.\r\nMy country’s position also remains firm on \r\nanother quite complex but crucial element of Security \r\nCouncil reform, namely, the question of the veto. The \r\nRussian Federation’s gross violations of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the fundamental principles of \r\ninternational law, which threaten European if not global \r\nsecurity, as well as the inability of the Security Council \r\nto react promptly to those actions, show the need to \r\nphase out the use of the veto. In the meantime, all \r\npermanent members of the Council should voluntarily \r\nand collectively pledge not to use that instrument in \r\ncases of mass atrocities, genocide, crimes against \r\nhumanity, war crimes and acts of aggression. In that \r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n12/25 16-36737\r\nconnection, Ukraine joined the relevant Accountability, \r\nCoherence and Transparency Group initiative, as well \r\nas the one presented by France and Mexico, and calls \r\nupon all United Nations Member States to follow suit. \r\nIn that regard, I fully concur with what the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Slovakia just mentioned.\r\nMy country stresses that for all of the aforementioned \r\nreasons, we believe that the need for Security Council \r\nreform is greater than ever.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): I am grateful for the convening of this \r\nmeeting and take this opportunity to recognize the \r\nexceptional work of Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, Chair \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations at the previous \r\nsession. I also wish to congratulate Romanian \r\nAmbassador Jinga and Tunisian Ambassador Khiari on \r\ntheir designation as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations at the current session. I can assure them of \r\nour full support in working constructively on the issue \r\nat hand.\r\nWhile Argentina aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Italy on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group (see A/71/PV.42), I wish \r\nto underscore a few elements.\r\nOnce again, we face our work, conscious of the \r\nneed to maintain a spirit of f lexibility, harmony, and \r\na strong commitment to multilateralism, as that is the \r\nonly way to ensure successful results. Argentina trusts \r\nthat all delegations will act accordingly, because only a \r\nwith a multilateral approach based on specific actions \r\nand leadership abilities that can see the interest of all \r\nnations can we achieve a more democratic, efficient \r\nand genuinely inclusive Security Council that can \r\nadequately fulfil the responsibilities conferred on it by \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nIt is clear that, as a democratic institution, the United \r\nNations continuously faces the need to strengthen the \r\nlegitimacy and representativeness of its organs. That \r\ntask is the responsibility of Member States and, as \r\nsuch, cannot and should not be delegated. That is why \r\nthat only in the framework of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations — carried out in good faith by Member \r\nStates in a spirit of mutual respect, openness, \r\ninclusiveness and transparency, as established by the \r\nAssembly in resolutions 48/26 and 53/30 and decision \r\n62/557 —  will it be feasible to find a solution that can \r\nmeet with the broadest possible political acceptance. \r\nBased on the experience gained over the course of \r\nthe protracted negotiation process, Argentina continues \r\nto make every effort to find innovative, consistent \r\nsolutions that ensure a more democratic composition \r\nin the Council, improved rotation of non-permanent \r\nmembers and reformulated working methods, so \r\nthat the Council can truly become more transparent, \r\ninteractive and inclusive. The Charter stipulates that \r\nin order to ensure the swift and effective action of the \r\nUnited Nations, its Members confer upon the Security \r\nCouncil the primary responsibility for maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security, and recognize that \r\nthe Council acts on their behalf when it discharges the \r\nfunctions entailed in carrying out that responsibility.\r\nThe victors of the Second World War assumed that \r\nresponsibility on a permanent basis. Nevertheless, any \r\nState that recognizes peace as vital to its development \r\nalso wishes to actively take on that responsibility. \r\nThat is why Argentina favours an increase only in the \r\nnon-permanent membership, because perpetuity is \r\nintrinsically at odds with the notion of representativeness \r\nin a democratic context, where the will of those who are \r\nrepresented periodically legitimizes that representation. \r\nIt is well known that elections are a fundamental element \r\nin every self-respecting legitimate and representative \r\ndemocratic system.\r\nThe improvement of the Council’s working \r\nmethods continues to be an issue of the greatest \r\nimportance for Argentina, and we have noted that view \r\nat every opportunity. For example, when we presided \r\nover the Working Group on Documentation and Other \r\nProcedural Questions, we proposed that the Council \r\nwork openly and transparently, keeping the entire \r\nOrganization abreast of its activities.\r\nIn conclusion, Argentina reiterates and reaffirms \r\nits willingness to keep an open mind and consider \r\nany proposal in line with the agreed principles of the \r\nAssembly that helps harmonize positions in order to \r\nbring about the necessary democratic reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nMr. Ruiz Blanco (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to begin by congratulating two very qualified \r\ncolleagues, Ambassador Ion Jinga of Romania and \r\nAmbassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari of Tunisia, for \r\ntheir designation as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform, and for their \r\ndecision to accept a task that is vital and surely requires \r\ncourage. I would also like to thank Ambassador Sylvie \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 13/25\r\nLucas for her constructive guidance of the debates and \r\nfor the progress achieved during the previous session.\r\nIt is evident that we can advance in the debate on \r\nthe reform of the Security Council, particularly after \r\nwhat was achieved in the process of revitalizing the \r\nGeneral Assembly: the selection and appointment \r\nof the Secretary-General through a process that was \r\nmore inclusive and transparent than seemed possible \r\ntwo years ago. This is the opportune moment, as \r\nAmbassador Sebastiano Cardi stated on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group (see A/71/PV.42), for \r\nshowing f lexibility and a spirit of compromise to give \r\nthe needed impulse to reform. \r\nThere are three important elements that we should \r\nkeep in mind. \r\nFirst, we all agree that it is necessary to expand \r\nthe number of non-permanent seats in the Council. \r\nAccordingly, I would like to emphasize that in recent \r\nnegotiation processes that were equally complex — such \r\nas the reform of Economic and Social Council and the \r\nprocess revitalizing the General Assembly — it has \r\nbeen demonstrated that the involvement of the entire \r\nmembership and a special emphasis on the elements \r\nof inclusivity, representativeness, accountability, \r\ntransparency and effectiveness helped to create the \r\nrecipe for success that can be transferred to this \r\nscenario.\r\nSecondly, we believe that it is timely to reiterate \r\nthe necessary commitment of all of us who take part \r\nin the intergovernmental negotiations to honouring the \r\nrules that should guide the process, in accordance with \r\ndecision 62/557.\r\nThirdly, this process is carried out by the States \r\nMembers of our Organization, and the proposals \r\nthat are discussed must come from them. We must \r\navoid shortcuts if we want to make effective progress \r\ntowards concrete reform. The topics discussed, \r\nanalysed and decided on by the Security Council all \r\nput the responsibility on Member States not to delay \r\nthe necessary actions nor the implementation of the \r\nurgent changes needed to maintain international peace \r\nand security.\r\nTo make concrete progress in our discussions, I \r\nwould like to add my voice to those, such as the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group, who believe that the process of \r\nnegotiations can make use of the lessons learned in \r\nthose consultations that focused on aspects on which \r\npositions were more similar,  such as the expansion \r\nin the number of non-permanent seats, establishing a \r\nnew category of long-term members, or the possibility \r\nof re-election. The main point is to produce a Security \r\nCouncil that is representative and democratic. \r\nThe President can always count on Colombia’s \r\ncommitment in this purpose.\r\nMr. Bonser (Canada) (spoke in French): Canada \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Italy on behalf of the Uniting \r\nfor Consensus group (see A/71/PV.42). We wish, \r\nhowever, to make a few points on this matter in our \r\nnational capacity.\r\nCanada is firmly in favour of a reform of the \r\nSecurity Council and agrees that it is long overdue. We \r\nare ready to work with all Member States to reach a \r\nconsensus that will transform the Council into a more \r\ndemocratic, representative, effective, transparent and \r\naccountable body. To that end we have three points \r\nto make.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFirst, Canada strongly believes that the effectiveness \r\nof the Council should be the overriding objective in \r\nthe reform process. In that respect, we need to address \r\nhonestly the issue of the veto and how it is applied. \r\nWe have all witnessed recent uses of the veto in ways \r\nthat damage the reputation of the Security Council \r\nand infringe upon its effectiveness. Clearly there is \r\nbroad support for a Security Council that can play its \r\nrole as envisaged in the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand that does not abuse the veto power. In that respect, \r\nCanada supports the Accountability, Coherence and \r\nTransparency group’s code of conduct and the French-\r\nMexican political declaration on veto restraint. Both \r\noffer important opportunities for achieving a reformed \r\nand strengthened Security Council that is able to \r\naddress global crises, especially in obvious cases of \r\nmass violations of human rights, deliberate attacks \r\non civilians, war crimes, crimes against humanity \r\nand genocide.\r\nSecondly, on the issue of representativeness, \r\nCanada strongly believes in expanding the number of \r\nnon-permanent seats on the Security Council. In doing \r\nso, we need to be mindful of the historical under-\r\nrepresentation of Africa and small island and developing \r\nStates. Increasing the number of non-permanent seats \r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n14/25 16-36737\r\nwould ensure a broader representation of the world’s \r\nregions and add to the Council’s legitimacy.\r\nThirdly, on the issues of democracy, transparency \r\nand accountability, Canada firmly believes that the \r\nholding of regular elections is the essential mechanism \r\nfor ensuring Council accountability before the General \r\nAssembly. It is also based on the conviction that there are \r\nways of making the Council more representative without \r\nconferring special rights on a few member States.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAfter many years of dialogue, there is a window of \r\nopportunity to achieve consensus on Security Council \r\nreform. Canada will remain a constructive partner in \r\nadvancing that goal.\r\nMr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to salute the indefatigable efforts \r\nof the Permanent Representative of Luxembourg in \r\nchairing the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform during the previous session. We also \r\nwelcome the decision of the President of the General \r\nAssembly to appoint the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Tunisia and Romania to co-chair the negotiations \r\nduring the seventy-first session. We hope that they will \r\nbe able to achieve a consensus that will preserve the \r\ninterests of all Member States. \r\nMy country aligns itself with the statements made \r\nby the representatives of Sierra Leone and Kuwait on \r\nbehalf of the Group of African States and the Group of \r\nArab States, respectively (see A/71/PV.42).\r\nThis debate on Security Council reform has \r\nhighlighted the links between the various elements of \r\nreform. We must therefore treat reform as an indivisible \r\nproject. We need to find a comprehensive solution for \r\nthe problem of Security Council reform that will take \r\ninto consideration all of the points of view that have \r\nemerged in the discussions. The intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations provide the only framework in which an \r\nagreement on Security Council expansion and reform \r\ncan be achieved in accordance with decision 62/557, \r\nwhich laid the foundation for negotiations on the matter.\r\nSecurity Council reform should not be limited to \r\nincreasing the number of permanent and non-permanent \r\nseats. We must also reform the working methods of the \r\nCouncil and its relationship with the other bodies of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is necessary to reform the Council’s \r\nworking methods in order to make all of its activities \r\nmore transparent. It is also important to limit the \r\nnumber of closed meetings and restrict the use of the \r\nveto in cases of mass atrocities, war crimes and crimes \r\nagainst humanity.\r\nWe must increase the participation of non-member \r\nStates in the work of the Security Council, particularly \r\ncountries that are directly or indirectly affected by the \r\nissues debated by the Council. The provisional rules \r\nof procedure must be replaced with permanent rules \r\nin order to increase the Council’s effectiveness. The \r\nrelationship between the Council and other United \r\nNations bodies must also be revised in order to delineate \r\nroles more clearly so that the Council does not infringe \r\non the functions of other bodies, specifically the General \r\nAssembly. There must also be closer cooperation and \r\ncoordination between the Council and other bodies, \r\nand the mandates of those bodies must be respected, \r\nin accordance with the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIn that regard, we are in favour of more consultation \r\nmeetings among the various bodies. It is also necessary \r\nthat the Council issue more reports on issues that \r\nthreaten international peace and security, and those \r\nreports should be exhaustive, transparent, neutral and \r\nsupported by factual evidence and analysis, given that \r\nthe General Assembly is the most representative body \r\nof the United Nations. \r\nMy country believes it is necessary to rectify the \r\nhistorical injustice done to the African continent by \r\ngiving it a permanent seat in the Security Council. That \r\nis a right that must be recognized as non-negotiable, \r\nespecially considering the fact that two thirds of the \r\nitems referred to the Security Council concern the \r\nAfrican continent. Africa must have two permanent \r\nseats on the Security Council with all the privileges \r\naccorded to current permanent members, including \r\nthe right to veto. Furthermore, in accordance with the \r\nCommon African Position enshrined in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration, any increase in \r\nthe membership of the Security Council should include \r\na permanent seat for Arab countries, in accordance \r\nwith the decision of the Arab League Summit in Sirte \r\nin 2010.\r\nDuring the negotiations that have taken place so \r\nfar, some consensus has been achieved in terms of the \r\nneed to redouble efforts to strengthen and revitalize the \r\nrole of the Security Council so that it may address and \r\novercome the challenges posed by the current global \r\nsituation. We must build a broader Security Council \r\nbased on the principles of transparency and neutrality. \r\nLibya is firmly committed to positively participating \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 15/25\r\nin all efforts aimed at attaining that goal, namely, \r\nSecurity Council reform, so that we may build an \r\ninternational Organization that is more democratic and \r\nmore transparent.\r\nMr. Ndong Ella (Gabon) (spoke in French): \r\nGabon aligns itself with the statement delivered by the \r\nrepresentative of Sierra Leone on behalf of the Group of \r\nAfrican States (see A/71/PV.42), My delegation would \r\nlike to add a few remarks in its national capacity.\r\nGabon thanks the President for organizing today’s \r\nmeeting on the question of equitable representation on \r\nand increase in the membership of the Security Council. \r\nSecurity Council reform is a priority, now more than \r\never. The outcome of the negotiations process on that \r\nreform will be decisive for the modernization of global \r\ngovernance and making it more democratic. \r\nAllow me to congratulate the new co-Chairs of \r\nthe intergovernmental negotiations, Ambassador \r\nMohamed Khaled Khiari, Permanent Representative \r\nof Tunisia, and Ambassador Ion Jinga, Permanent \r\nRepresentative  of Romania. I also commend the work \r\naccomplished by Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, former \r\nPermanent Representative of Luxembourg, who was an \r\noutstanding Chair throughout the previous session.\r\nThe issue of Security Council reform continues \r\nto give rise to great differences after several years of \r\ndiscussion. The negotiations, which appear to be never-\r\nending, have nonetheless allowed us to agree on two \r\nessential points. The first is that global governance \r\nneeds to be improved if it is to deal effectively with \r\nthe new forms of very complex threats that the world \r\nfaces today. The second is that, to be credible, global \r\ngovernance must take into account the current global \r\nbalance. \r\nThe reform of our Organization in general, and \r\nof the Security Council in particular, has become \r\nmore than a necessity. The Council must meet the \r\nrequirements of the present day.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the progress achieved, \r\nparticularly in the convergence of opinions on the \r\nmatter of the relationship between the Security Council \r\nand the General Assembly, on the one hand, and the \r\nCouncil’s size and working methods, on the other. \r\nThere are two elements of convergence in the five \r\nprincipal negotiation points. We remain convinced that \r\nthat positive dynamic can also make it possible to reach \r\nconsensus on the other points under consideration, \r\nnamely, regional representation, membership categories \r\nand the veto.\r\nAs His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, Head \r\nof State and President of the Republic of Gabon, has \r\nsaid here, the Security Council must be reformed so \r\nthat multilateralism takes precedence over the power of \r\nStates. To nourish values such as democracy, the world \r\nwe live in today cannot continue to be organized on the \r\nconcept of a balance of power. An international system \r\nbased on power, whether balanced or concerted, has the \r\ndisadvantage of favouring a hierarchy, of marginalizing \r\nsmall States and promoting non-reciprocity. On the \r\ncontrary, multilateralism — of which the United \r\nNations is the guarantor — favours collective security \r\nover the balance of power, inclusion over selection.\r\nThe voice of Africa must be heard, and its position \r\nmust be taken into account. My delegation thank all \r\nthose who have supported that African goal in some \r\nway. The African continent represents the largest \r\ngeographical group in the General Assembly, and \r\nAfrican issues alone constitute more than 60 per cent \r\nof the situations considered by the Security Council. \r\nGoing forward, Africa must be have a place among the \r\npermanent members of the Security Council, with all of \r\nthe privileges attached to that status, including the right \r\nof the veto, if that is maintained. \r\nThe Ezulwini Consensus seeks to accomplish one \r\nthing: to repair the injustice that Africa has suffered \r\nfor too many years. It is unfortunate that the Common \r\nAfrican Position has not yet evoked a dynamic \r\nsolidarity, which, I believe, would have facilitated and \r\naccelerated the process of Security Council reform.\r\nGabon, like other African countries, will continue \r\nto promote Africa’s will to participate fully in global \r\ngovernance and to be recognized for its strengths and \r\ncapacities, no longer for its weaknesses. I strongly  hope \r\nthat the upcoming rounds of negotiations will enable us \r\nto build bridges between our various points of view so \r\nthat we can successfully conclude the lengthy process \r\nfor the benefit of our Organization.\r\nMr. Sukhee (Mongolia): I would like to begin \r\nby thanking the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor his leadership and for steering the discussion of \r\nthe important agenda items that we have before us, \r\nincluding the reform of the Security Council.\r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n16/25 16-36737\r\nMy delegation aligns itself with the statement \r\ndelivered earlier by Ambassador Menissa Rambally of \r\nSaint Lucia on behalf of the L.69 group (see A/71/PV.42).\r\nI would also like to congratulate Ambassador Ion \r\nJinga of Romania and Ambassador Mohamed Khaled \r\nKhiari of Tunisia on their appointment as the new \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations. I wish \r\nto assure the co-Chairs of my delegation’s full support \r\nand cooperation in that process.\r\nMy delegation shares the view that today a new \r\nimpetus should be given to the consideration of the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and \r\nrelated matters. We need to intensify our efforts to \r\nachieve concrete progress on that matter. Mongolia \r\nreiterates its support for the decision to continue the \r\nprocess of intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform during the seventy-first session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nI would like to reaffirm our principled position on \r\nSecurity Council reform. Mongolia has consistently \r\nstood for a just and equitable expansion in both the \r\npermanent and the non-permanent categories of \r\nmembership, as well as for an improvement in the \r\nCouncil’s working methods. Our stance in favour of \r\nenlarging both current categories is guided by and \r\nbased on the Charter of the United Nations, modern-day \r\ngeopolitical realities and the principles of justice and \r\nequality, with a view to ensuring a greater and enhanced \r\nrepresentation of developing countries, particularly of \r\nnon- and underrepresented regional groups. \r\nMongolia recognizes the importance of text-\r\nbased negotiations in order for the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations to move forward. It is high time to finally \r\nmake progress and advance the reform agenda in the \r\nupcoming negotiations.\r\nI would like to reiterate my delegation’s firm belief \r\nthat, with a genuine will on the part of Member States, \r\nwe will be able to make tangible progress towards an \r\nearly reform of the Security Council.\r\nMs. Argüello González (Nicaragua) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): We thank the President for convening \r\nthis important meeting on the issue of equitable \r\nrepresentation in the Security Council and the increase \r\nin its membership. We congratulate Ambassadors \r\nIon Jinga of Romania and Mohamed Khaled Khiari \r\nof Tunisia on their appointments as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on that topic. We are \r\ncertain that their stewardship will sustain the dynamism \r\nand momentum of the negotiating group.\r\nNicaragua aligns itself with the statement made \r\nby the Permanent Representative of Saint Lucia, \r\nAmbassador Menissa Rambally, on behalf of the L.69 \r\ngroup (see A/71/PV.42).\r\nWe hope that this discussion will go deep into the \r\ncore issue, the real nucleus of the debate, which is to \r\nachieve extensive reform of the Security Council. \r\nThere are currently 193 Member States, and the \r\nOrganization of which we are Members, especially the \r\nSecurity Council, must evolve in a very different world. \r\nThe Security Council urgently requires comprehensive \r\nreform in order to act in accordance with the realities \r\nof the twenty-first century. It must be expanded \r\nin both categories of membership, permanent and \r\nnon-permanent.\r\nAfter many years of involvement in those \r\nnegotiations, we have a text that has been agreed upon \r\nby consensus, and we should proceed immediately. We \r\nare ready and prepared to negotiate; now is the time for \r\nconcrete results. Furthermore, we welcome the creation \r\nof the group of friends on Security Council reform, \r\nof which Nicaragua is a member, and which has as its \r\nguiding principles the prompt adoption of reforms, text-\r\nbased negotiations and an expansion of both categories \r\nof membership.\r\nNicaragua is committed to all initiatives that are \r\nable to lead us to recreate, reinvent and reconstruct \r\nthe United Nations, fulfilling the growing demand for \r\na democratic Organization that serves the supreme \r\ninterests of sovereign security, justice and world peace. \r\nNicaragua will continue to support all efforts to reform \r\nthe Security Council. We reiterate the commitment of \r\nthe Nicaraguan people to seek an open, thorough and \r\nreflective process for the necessary transformation and \r\nfor the reinvention and democratization of the United \r\nNations.\r\nMs. Bogyay (Hungary): More than ever, we all \r\nneed a strong and representative Security Council \r\nthat can continue to play a decisive role in preserving \r\npeace and security around the globe. Designing such \r\na Security Council is not only in the best interests \r\nof the international community, but also our shared \r\nresponsibility.\r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 17/25\r\nLast July, the General Assembly decided to continue \r\nthe negotiations on Security Council reform at its \r\nseventy-first session. In that respect, Hungary warmly \r\nwelcomes the decision of the President of the General \r\nAssembly to appoint two Ambassadors, who are good \r\ncolleagues of ours — the Ambassador of Romania \r\nand the Ambassador of Tunisia — as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations. I wish them success, \r\nluck and perseverance in that very important endeavour. \r\nWe would like to offer our support to their work. We \r\nwelcome the active engagement of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly in moving the process forward more \r\nquickly by convening this debate.\r\nAs is common in our line of work, this is an \r\narea where we do not have to reinvent the wheel. We \r\nneed only build upon the achievements of previous \r\nintergovernmental negotiations, especially those \r\nthat took place this past year. I should note, in that \r\nconnection, that the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nhave been going on for quite a few years. In our view, \r\nvarious elements of convergence have emerged on all \r\ntopics, while we recognize the fact that two out of \r\nthe five issues on the list — the relationship between \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly, \r\nand the size of an enlarged Council and its working \r\nmethods — have gained the most traction. They now \r\nhave to be transformed into concrete proposals, but \r\nwork should be continued in all areas.\r\nWe believe special attention should be given to the \r\nfollowing three issues: the categories of membership, \r\nregional representation and the question of the use of \r\nthe veto in cases with regard to which the convergence \r\nof views is less clear and has not been set out in a \r\nconsolidated, written format. We should continue to bear \r\nin mind the comprehensive, and often interconnected \r\nnature, of the reform, which encompasses all five of the \r\nkey issues set out in decision 62/557 of 15 September \r\n2008.\r\nHungary continues to support the enlargement of \r\nthe Security Council in both the permanent and the \r\nnon-permanent categories. As a guiding principle, \r\nenlargement must continue to be based on regional groups \r\nand must be guided by their equitable representation. \r\nIn that spirit, Hungary reiterates its call for a second \r\nnon-permanent seat for the Group of Eastern European \r\nStates, which is a request that is part of any enlargement \r\nmodel. There are different and legitimate national \r\nviews when it comes to Security Council reform. The \r\nonly way to cater to those interests, while agreeing on \r\nthe much-needed reform itself, is through meaningful \r\nconsultations. We should be moving forward with \r\nsubstantial text-based negotiations. Hungary is looking \r\nforward to receiving proposals from the co-Chairs \r\non a relevant work programme and a schedule for the \r\nnegotiating sessions.\r\nI also believe that simply enlarging the Council \r\nwithout further reforms in its working methods can \r\nonly recreate the present problems. Together with \r\n111 countries, Hungary supports the code of conduct \r\nthat constitutes a voluntary pledge not to vote against \r\nSecurity Council resolutions aimed at preventing or \r\nending atrocity crimes. The issue of the veto lies very \r\nmuch at the heart of our negotiations.\r\nHungary is ready to continue working actively to \r\nreform the Security Council.\r\nMr. Beleffi (San Marino): I would first like to \r\nthank the President for convening our annual debate on \r\nSecurity Council reform.\r\nSan Marino associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by the representative of Italy on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group (see A/71/PV.42). I would \r\nalso like to make some remarks in my national capacity.\r\nSan Marino has always believed that reform of \r\nthe Security Council must be based on the principles \r\nof democracy, transparency and accountability, which \r\nshould be integral to any United Nations reform \r\neffort, not just to that of the Security Council. A wide \r\nmajority of Member States welcomed the reform of \r\nthe selection process for the position of Secretary-\r\nGeneral introduced during the previous session of \r\nthe Assembly, making that process more democratic, \r\ntransparent and inclusive. Now we need a wide majority \r\nof Member States to agree on reforms that can make \r\nthe Council more democratic, transparent, accountable, \r\nrepresentative and effective. In our view, if we want \r\nto stick to those principles, regular elections are the \r\nonly way to ensure an accountable and democratic \r\nCouncil. An increase only in non-permanent seats, to \r\nwhich Member States must be elected, can ensure that \r\nthe principles of democracy and accountability will \r\nbe observed.\r\nWith regard to the process of reforming the Security \r\nCouncil, San Marino welcomes the decision to appoint \r\ntwo co-Chairs for the intergovernmental negotiations, \r\nand I congratulate the Ambassadors of Romania \r\nand Tunisia on their assumption of that important \r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n18/25 16-36737\r\nresponsibility. The delegation of San Marino assures \r\nthem of its full collaboration during the negotiations. \r\nEven if wide differences remain on critical issues, \r\nwe Member States are all agreed on Assembly decision \r\n62/557. That indicates that credible Security Council \r\nreform requires a comprehensive approach and that \r\nthe negotiations must be driven by Member States. \r\nWe are familiar with each other’s points of view on \r\nthe various topics relating to reform. It is now our \r\ncollective responsibility to move the process forward. \r\nWe believe that only a compromise solution will enable \r\nus to achieve comprehensive Security Council reform.\r\nMs. Morton (New Zealand): Since the United \r\nNations was established in 1945, the world has \r\nundergone huge changes. The Organization has \r\ngrown from 51 Member States to 193 today. Against \r\nthat backdrop and in the face of unprecedented global \r\nchallenges, Security Council reform has become more \r\ncritical than ever. The United Nations needs a Security \r\nCouncil that is capable of acting to prevent and resolve \r\nthe kinds of crises facing the world in 2016 and beyond.\r\nWe thank the President for appointing the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Romania and Tunisia as co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations process, and \r\nwe wish them all the best in the challenging task \r\nahead. New Zealand also thanks the previous Chair, \r\nAmbassador Lucas of Luxembourg. We hope that the \r\nnew co-Chairs will build on her excellent work. In that \r\nregard, the elements of convergence represent a useful \r\npoint from which to move forward.\r\nAs a current elected member of the Security Council, \r\nNew Zealand is acutely aware of the challenges that too \r\noften result in poor performance by the Council. Many \r\nof those challenges f low directly from the Council’s \r\n1945 framework, particularly regarding the status and \r\nrole of its permanent members. \r\nMore than 25 years of negotiations on structural \r\nreform of the Council demonstrate that reform based \r\non the concept of new permanent members will be \r\nvery difficult to achieve. That is why New Zealand is \r\na supporter of an intermediate solution for Security \r\nCouncil expansion. Recognizing the realities of the \r\nsituation, New Zealand has put significant energy into \r\npushing for internal reforms of the Council as it is now, \r\nand especially into securing meaningful improvements \r\nto its day-to-day working methods so as to make them \r\nmore effective, results-driven, transparent and inclusive.\r\nNew Zealand has pushed to enhance the quality \r\nof informal discussions in the Council, with the aim \r\nof improving its capacity to respond collectively to \r\nconflict and emerging crises. We have driven reform \r\nof the process for appointing the chairs of the Council’s \r\nsubsidiary bodies, taking that important role out of \r\nthe exclusive control of the five permanent members. \r\nNew Zealand has also worked with the Secretariat and \r\nother Council members to establish monthly situational \r\nawareness briefings designed to ensure that Council \r\nmembers have access to quality information on evolving \r\nand potential crises.\r\nIn the context of peacekeeping, New Zealand \r\nhas hosted informal triangular meetings on specific \r\npeacekeeping operations aimed at ensuring more \r\neffective, thorough and respectful consultations among \r\nthe Council, the Secretariat and troop-contributing \r\ncountries. We have also strongly advocated for better \r\nworking methods to reflect the needs of conflict \r\nprevention and of the Council’s mandate under Chapter \r\nVI of the Charter of the United Nations. The prevention \r\nof conflict requires much better shared information \r\nfrom the field and better practical engagement on the \r\npart of Council members. To help achieve that, New \r\nZealand has supported increasing country visits by \r\nthe Council. We are pleased to note that this week \r\nthe Council will visit the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and Angola, its fifth visiting mission for 2016.\r\nI have mentioned small but impactful reforms that \r\nhave the potential to improve the quality of the Council’s \r\ndiscussions and performance over the long term. We \r\nurge Council members to continue such reforms in the \r\nyears to come and to progressively add to them. Such \r\nreforms can be accomplished; they are not impossible. \r\nWe note the value of achieving procedural reform \r\nthrough the agreement of all Council members, if \r\npossible. But we should also remember that most issues \r\nrelated to working methods are ultimately procedural \r\nin nature and are therefore governed by Article 27, \r\nparagraph 2, of the Charter.\r\nMr. Gómez Camacho (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMexico associates itself with the statement delivered \r\nearlier by the representative of Italy on behalf of the \r\nUniting for Consensus group (see A/71/PV.42).\r\nMy country welcomes today’s meeting and the \r\nPresident’s appointment of Ambassadors Jinga and \r\nKhiari as co-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiation \r\nprocess for Security Council reform. Their appointment \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 19/25\r\nwill give the process fresh and positive momentum \r\nand should help to ensure that the negotiations are \r\nguided by the principles of transparency, impartiality, \r\nobjectivity and inclusiveness, as was the case in the \r\nprevious session under Ambassador Lucas.\r\nThis has been a year of paradigm change in our \r\nOrganization. With renewed vitality, the General \r\nAssembly is already playing a central role in the United \r\nNations. We have shown that the United Nations can be \r\ndifferent. It is not a sclerotic 70-year-old organism but \r\nan organization capable of being modern and current \r\nand, above all, one that can respond to the expectations \r\nof the international community in the twenty-first \r\ncentury. \r\nIt is increasingly evident that 15 States in the \r\nSecurity Council are not enough to represent us all. It is \r\nbecoming increasingly clear every day that the Security \r\nCouncil must revise and modernize its working \r\nmethods, that it must not fall into a state of paralysis, \r\nand that its inaction may lead the whole Organization \r\ninto irrelevance.\r\nReform of the Security Council is possible, and \r\nthe proposal by the Uniting for Consensus group is \r\na realistic and viable proposal around which a new \r\nunderstanding should be formed. \r\nMexico affirms that we have a proposal is inclusive \r\nand is based on democracy, because it is founded on \r\ninclusion and attends in the most obvious way to the \r\naspirations of all. The compromise formula, which \r\nMexico and the Uniting for Consensus group are \r\npromoting is based on the creation of non-permanent \r\nseats with long-term mandates and the possibility of \r\nimmediate re-election. That would allow for a fair \r\nand equitable representation in the Council, as well \r\nas an increase in the number of non-permanent seats \r\nwith two-year terms. That model provides sufficient \r\nroom for action to negotiate and ensure appropriate \r\nregional representation for all underrepresented \r\ngroups, including small States, while preserving the \r\nprinciples of transparency and accountability to the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nOur proposal, which includes immediate \r\nre-election, contributes with greater transparency and \r\nefficiency to equitable geographical representation \r\nand to the assumption of greater responsibilities for \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nattending to the legitimate interest  of those States \r\nseeking long-term seats. \r\nThe Uniting for Consensus formula seeks the \r\ndemocratization of the Security Council, which must \r\nbe a key objective and a value shared by all of us. It \r\nrejects the creation of additional privileges for only \r\nsome countries. If we continue to give permanent \r\nprivileges to just a few members in order to meet \r\nnational ambitions to the detriment of the collective \r\ninterest, we will not achieve our goal. Those privileges \r\ndo not belong in a modern and democratic organization. \r\nThey have nothing to do with the twenty-first century.\r\nThe strengthened participation of the General \r\nAssembly in the historic process that resulted in the \r\nelection of António Guterres as Secretary-General \r\nconfirmed that it is time to build convergences among \r\nthe various positions of Member States and in that \r\nway move forward towards an integral reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe delegation of Mexico will be constructive and \r\nactive in that process, which should be developed on \r\nthe basis of all the proposals by Member States, as \r\nstipulated in decision 62/557, and not only on the basis \r\nof certain documents submitted by previous facilitators \r\nwho worked earlier in that process.\r\nMr. Bin Momen (Bangladesh): We thank the \r\nPresident for convening this debate as a curtain-raiser \r\nto the work of the intergovernmental negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform during the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session.\r\nBangladesh reaffirms the central role of the \r\nAssembly in debating the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership \r\nof the Security Council and other matters relating to \r\nthe Council. We underscore the need to sustain the \r\nmomentum of earlier discussions to identify elements \r\nof convergence among Member States on the five \r\ninterrelated and mutually reinforcing issues that form \r\npart of this agenda item.\r\nBangladesh welcomes the appointment of the \r\nPermanent Representatives of Romania and Tunisia, \r\nAmbassador Jinga and Ambassador Khiari respectively, \r\nas co-Chairs of the negotiations for the current session. \r\nWe look forward to an early outline of the co-Chairs’ \r\nworkplan with suggestions on the structure, format \r\nand purpose of our discussions going forward. We \r\nwish to see our deliberations advance in the direction \r\nof starting up text-based negotiations with a view to \r\nachieving tangible and meaningful outcomes.\r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n20/25 16-36737\r\nIn the past couple of years, we have witnessed \r\nactive interest among a large number of delegations in \r\ntaking the discussions forward in a decisive direction. \r\nWe have also seen openness among others to engage \r\nin frank, interactive dialogue so as to explore answers \r\nto certain outstanding issues. It is critical to underpin \r\nthe comprehensive nature of the Council’s reform \r\nagenda, and the primacy of a set of objective, rational \r\nand non-arbitrary criteria for informing and guiding \r\nthe outcome of the ongoing negotiations. It should be \r\nin the shared interest of all Member States to maintain \r\nthe forward-leaning thrust of those discussions in a \r\ncollegial atmosphere.\r\nAt this stage, we suggest that due consideration \r\nshould be given to views expressed by Member States \r\nat various negotiation meetings, in addition to the \r\nelements contained in the framework document on \r\nSecurity Council reform and its annex, as well as the \r\nelements paper from the previous two negotiating \r\nsessions. We have noted some creative suggestions \r\nemanating from the evolving discussions that may \r\neffectively contribute to the current exercise of \r\nidentifying elements of convergence.\r\nThe former Chair of the negotiations helped us to \r\narrive at a common set of priorities shared by the entire \r\nmembership on two of the issues under consideration. \r\nWe believe that there is ample scope for further \r\nconstructive efforts towards identifying common \r\nelements on the other three critical issues and for \r\nforging consensus in areas where divergences prevail. \r\nIn that regard, my delegation stands ready to extend its \r\nfull cooperation to the newly appointed co-Chairs.\r\nTo briefly recapitulate our position, we reiterate \r\nour support for the enlargement of the Council in both \r\nthe permanent and the non-permanent categories. We \r\nsubscribe to the view that the size of the enlarged \r\nCouncil should be in the mid-twenties range, with \r\nadequate representation for the various regional blocs, \r\nespecially those that are underrepresented in the \r\ncurrent composition.\r\nMr. Dorji (Bhutan): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this important debate.\r\nMy delegation associates itself with the statement \r\ndelivered by Ambassador Menissa Rambally, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Saint Lucia, on behalf of the L.69 \r\ngroup of developing countries (see A/71/PV.42). \r\nWe meet again to deliberate on a subject of great \r\nimportance to this institution and to all of us. We are \r\nconfident that our deliberations under the leadership \r\nof the President of the Assembly will be meaningful \r\nand productive.\r\nBhutan welcomes the appointment of Ambassador \r\nIon Jinga, Permanent Representative of Romania, \r\nand Ambassador Mohamed Khiari, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia, as co-Chairs of the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. I assure them of Bhutan’s full support and \r\ncooperation. I also commend the previous Chair of the \r\nnegotiations, Ambassador Sylvie Lucas of Luxembourg, \r\nfor her leadership and contributions during the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session.\r\nWe meet at a time defined by important, ground-\r\nbreaking agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, the Addis Ababa Action \r\nAgenda on financing for development and the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. Those positive \r\ndevelopments bear testimony to our collective resolve to \r\nadvance peace, security, human rights and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Against that backdrop, we must now work \r\nin earnest, with similar resolve, to bring to fruition \r\nthe call by our leaders in 2005 for early reform of the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nSince the founding of the United Nations, the world \r\nhas undergone profound changes. The membership \r\nof the Organization has increased fourfold, and the \r\nchallenges we face have become more complex. \r\nInstitutions cannot remain static; they must evolve and \r\nadapt to stay relevant, effective and fit for purpose. As \r\nthe principal organ of the United Nations responsible \r\nfor the maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nthe Security Council must be made more representative, \r\nefficient and transparent. Bhutan supports the need \r\nto reform the Security Council in keeping with \r\ncontemporary realities. The expansion of the Security \r\nCouncil in both categories of membership and the \r\nimprovement of its working methods is necessary to \r\nfurther strengthen and enhance the legitimacy and \r\nfunctioning of the Council and to ensure that it is well \r\npoised to address the complex challenges of our times.\r\nIn this regard, Bhutan welcomes the formation of \r\nthe group of friends of Security Council reform — a \r\ndiverse group of countries committed to accelerating \r\nthe negotiating process for meaningful reform of \r\nthe Security Council based on the principles of \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 21/25\r\ncommitment to early reform, text-based negotiations \r\nand the expansion of the Council in both categories \r\nof membership.\r\nWe have engaged extensively on the question of \r\nSecurity Council reform for many years. However, \r\nthe lack of a negotiation text has inhibited meaningful \r\nprogress. It is now essential to move beyond the \r\nrestatement of well-known positions and make the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations process results-\r\noriented by commencing text-based negotiations. Only \r\nthen will we be able to build on areas of convergence \r\nand seek out common ground in areas that we disagree \r\non. We look to the leadership of the President and that \r\nof the co-Chairs to take the process forward in a manner \r\nthat will yield concrete results. Towards this end, my \r\ndelegation looks forward to engaging constructively \r\nwith all delegations.\r\nMs. Chuard (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland would like to thank the President for \r\nconvening this meeting on the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership \r\nof the Security Council and other matters related to \r\nthe Security Council. We would also like to thank \r\nAmbassador Jinga and Ambassador Khiarie for having \r\nagreed to co-chair the intergovernmental negotiations \r\non this matter. We wish them every success in their \r\nwork and reassure them of Switzerland’s support in the \r\ndiscussions on this important issue.\r\nSwitzerland welcomes the positive developments \r\nthat have taken place during the most recent round \r\nof negotiations and thanks the former Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Luxembourg for her efforts. Lastly, \r\nwe encourage all States to participate constructively \r\nin the upcoming negotiations with a view to making \r\nprogress on this crucial issue and to take into \r\nconsideration the documents indicating the elements of \r\nconvergence developed during the seventieth session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nMs. Flores Herrera (Panama) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFirst and foremost, allow me to welcome the \r\nPresident’s initiative in calling for the resumption of \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform with a view to breathing new life into this very \r\nimportant process and to commend him for convening \r\nthis debate on issues related to the question of equal \r\nrepresentation on the Security Council and increasing \r\nits membership and related matters.\r\nWe would like to express anew our appreciation to \r\nthe representatives of Jamaica and Luxembourg for their \r\nwork during the two past sessions. We would also like \r\nto wish every success to the Ambassadors of Romania \r\nand Tunisia as they take on this important challenge. \r\nPanama is always ready to participate constructively in \r\nall the initiatives being undertaken with the overriding \r\ngoal of achieving a democratic and representative \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nThe size of an expanded Council has been \r\naddressed at various times in the course of these \r\nnegotiations. Clearly, this is a point of agreement \r\namong a significant number of States that believe that \r\nsuch increase arises naturally and logically from the \r\ngrowth of the Organization and thus from the regional \r\nand representative nature that should be reflected in \r\nall its bodies. Panama has stated and now reiterates its \r\nview that this is a matter of simple arithmetic. In 1963, \r\nthe Security Council consisted of 11 of the 51 Member \r\nStates, which was 22 per cent of the Organization’s \r\nmembership. Today, however, only 2.59 per cent of the \r\ntotal membership is represented. That is a far cry from \r\nthe necessary point of equity that a global body requires.\r\nThe Security Council membership is not indifferent \r\nto the majority’s desire to transition towards a Council \r\nwith a better geographical balance and greater \r\nparticipation by States in the decision-making process. \r\nThe Council cannot remain subject to the decisions, \r\nand even less to the differences, of five States, because \r\nthat limits the comprehensive treatment of the items on \r\nits agenda, as has been made disturbingly clear very \r\nrecently. \r\nIn the various proposals that have been set forth \r\nover the course of the sessions, the number of members \r\nof a reformed Council varies between 21 and 27. That is \r\nvery important as a basis for discussion as we continue \r\nto seek consensus. Nevertheless, my delegation places \r\neven greater importance on the political will, attitude \r\nand acceptance of change manifested by States, \r\nespecially the permanent five, as they address this issue \r\nand participate in and continue this process.\r\nThe positions can be and, indeed, are different, but \r\nwe must get rid of polarized positions with conditions \r\nattached so as to move towards the centre, in a common \r\nunderstanding of the need for reform, To that end, \r\nPanama supports the continuation of negotiations \r\non the basis of a text, which we already have in the \r\nframework document. \r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n22/25 16-36737\r\nPanama reaffirms its position on the need to evolve \r\ntoward a Security Council of the twenty-first century, \r\nin harmony with a varied and complex global context \r\nthat increasingly demands an efficient and effective \r\nCouncil, and given the new challenges that cannot be \r\ntackled with old strategies.\r\nWith regard to equitable representation, \r\nit is imperative that more of the traditionally \r\nunderrepresented States — especially developing \r\nStates, African States, island States, States in Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean and States in Asia and the \r\nPacific — become active participants in the deliberations \r\nand especially in the decisions of the Security Council \r\nand its subsidiary bodies. With that participatory \r\nvision, Panama has proposed a conciliatory, time-based \r\nsolution to Security Council reform whereby, over a \r\nperiod of from 15 to 30 years, we would transition to a \r\nSecurity Council that by the United Nations hundredth \r\nanniversary, in 2045, would be made up of 26 members, \r\nall serving on an equal basis and all elected for a term of \r\nthree years, with the option of consecutive re-election.\r\nIn brief, Panama shares and supports the \r\napproaches of those countries that want to modernize, \r\nupdate and strengthen the Security Council by \r\nincreasing its membership as an expression of the \r\nlegitimacy and representativeness of the 193 States and \r\nof geographical balance; by increasing participation \r\nby States, principally developing countries, in the \r\ndecision-making process; by getting rid of the veto; \r\nand by eliminating special status and exclusive powers \r\nwithin that body, in the interest of the sovereign equality \r\nof all its members.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to stress that in a world \r\nconvulsed by terrorism, extreme violence and growing \r\nhumanitarian crises, international public opinion \r\nhopes for and expects more from the United Nations. \r\nThat having been said, progress in the reform process \r\nis dependent on good-faith and ethical negotiations \r\nconducted in absolute transparency, as well as on \r\ndetachment, respect and open-mindedness towards the \r\ninteractive debate that we are now resuming.\r\nMs. Sapag Muñoz de la Peña (Chile) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Chile is grateful for the convening of this \r\nmeeting in the framework of the intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations on Security Council reform to address the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. We would like to express our appreciation \r\nfor the work done by Ambassador Sylvie Lucas, \r\nand we recall the framework document prepared by \r\nAmbassador Rattray during the sixty-ninth session. \r\nAlso, we welcome the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Romania and Tunisia as co-Chairs at the current \r\nsession, and we wish them every success in their work.\r\nIn that connection, we appeal for compromise \r\nsolutions that would allow us to move forward with the \r\nreform to make the work of the Security Council truly \r\nlegitimate and transparent. The recent selection process \r\nfor the Secretary-General, as well as the dynamic \r\nobserved in the work of the Council in particularly \r\ncomplex and painful situations, make it more necessary \r\nthan ever before to make progress towards ensuring \r\nthose two qualities: legitimacy and transparency.\r\nRegarding the categories of Security Council \r\nmembership, we stress that we must expand both the \r\npermanent and non-permanent categories so that the \r\nCouncil can be a truly representative body that reflects \r\nthe new geopolitical realities and can address the \r\nsituations on its agenda appropriately. At the same time, \r\nwe recognize the progress that has been made since the \r\nlast reform of the Council. We reiterate our position that \r\nthe expansion of the category of permanent members \r\ndoes not mean an extension of the right of veto. In that \r\nregard, Chile reaffirms its commitment to the code of \r\nconduct on restricting the use of the veto, promoted \r\nby the Accountability, Coherence and Transparency \r\ngroup, of which we are a member, and also to the joint \r\nFrance-Mexico political declaration.\r\nThe various proposals — on the categories \r\nof members, the question of the veto, regional \r\nrepresentation and the relationship between the Council \r\nand the Assembly — as a whole must lead to more \r\nefficient working methods that make it possible for \r\nthe Council to address the challenges to international \r\npeace and security in a timely manner. Equally, we \r\nmust avoid reforms that impede the working methods \r\nof the Council. \r\nChile reiterates its support for the co-Chairs and our \r\ncommitment to advancing the reform of the Council.\r\nMs. Sande (Uruguay) (spoke in Spanish): Uruguay \r\nexpresses its gratitude for the convening of this meeting \r\nof the Assembly to address the question of equitable \r\nrepresentation on and increase in the membership of \r\nthe Security Council. We congratulate the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Romania, Ambassador Ion Jinga, \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 23/25\r\nand Ambassador Mohamed Khaled Khiari, Permanent \r\nRepresentative of Tunisia, on their task as co-Chairs.\r\nAs we have said in previous statements on the \r\nsubject, Uruguay has upheld the principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Since the Organization \r\nwas established, we have struggled for the growth of \r\nthe Organization because of the resulting benefits in \r\nterms of peace, the promotion and protection of human \r\nrights and the development of States. We are convinced \r\nthat the Security Council exercises a most important \r\nresponsibility in the task of maintaining peace, and the \r\ndemocratization of its composition and decision-making \r\nprocesses is essential.\r\nUruguay understands why at the time when the \r\nUnited Nations was established — and given the \r\nfailure of its predecessor, the League of Nations — it \r\nwas necessary for States to commit to the provisions \r\nof its founding Charter and the involvement of the \r\nvictors of the Second World War as a way to ensure \r\nthe continuity and functioning of the Organization. \r\nWe believe that today’s world requires more action \r\nand commitment on the part of States when they work \r\ntogether and cooperate in order to prevent and resolve \r\nconflicts. And in that regard, having more members in \r\nthe Security Council would undoubtedly create balance \r\nin the decision-making processes.\r\nUruguay reiterates its support for both the United \r\nNations and the commitment it assumed from the outset \r\nto supporting the development of the Organization and \r\nany growth or change in it that would lead to a greater \r\nbalance and facilitate the realization of its objectives.\r\nUruguay has opposed and continues to oppose \r\nconferring the privilege of veto power on any new \r\npermanent members resulting from the reform. \r\nUruguay’s position goes back to the very moment when \r\nthe Organization was established at the San Francisco \r\nConference. The delegation of Uruguay underlined \r\nthe need to not have differences of prerogatives or \r\nrights among the members of the Security Council, \r\nwhile accepting that those countries that had borne \r\nthe greatest burden of the war would have seats on the \r\nSecurity Council — not indefinitely, but for a period of \r\ntime considered prudent. \r\nAccordingly, we wish to announce that, given the \r\ndevelopment of the discussions and the nature of the \r\nproposals put forth, the delegation of Uruguay will \r\nsupport the consensus and assumes the commitment to \r\nwork towards a balanced increase in the membership \r\nand a change in the voting procedure.\r\nMr. Awad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I thank the President for convening such an \r\nimportant meeting. I would like to take the opportunity \r\nto congratulate the Permanent Representatives \r\nof Romania and Tunisia on their appointment as \r\nco-Chairs of the intergovernmental negotiations on the \r\nquestion of equitable representation on and increase \r\nin the membership of the Security Council and related \r\nmatters. We assure them of our cooperation in the \r\nupcoming negotiations on Security Council reform, \r\nas the United Nations cannot be reformed unless the \r\nCouncil is reformed.\r\nAllow me at the outset to clarify the position of \r\nSyria on the important issue before us. Syria is among \r\nthose countries that have been calling for reform of the \r\nSecurity Council over the past 24 years. We participated \r\neffectively in the first Open-ended Working Group with \r\na view to ensuring that the Security Council reflects the \r\nstatus quo of today, many years after its establishment. \r\nMy delegation is of the view that in the negotiations, \r\nthe five key issues of reform set out in decision \r\n62/557 — categories of membership, the question of the \r\nveto, regional representation, size of an enlarged Security \r\nCouncil and its working methods, and the relationship \r\nbetween the Council and the Assembly — should be \r\ndiscussed together. Moreover, we believe that the United \r\nNations intergovernmental negotiating machinery \r\nshould be used for the negotiations.\r\nMy delegation is of the view that the issues of \r\ncategories of membership and regional representation \r\nrequire further discussion, because, after what we have \r\nwitnessed, there is the potential to deepen the existing \r\ndivides in the Security Council in its current structure. \r\nCertain countries that have become members of the \r\nCouncil are not politically independent, but rather \r\nare pressured by other countries. Those countries \r\nare set on satisfying the influential countries, whose \r\nagendas they serve at the expense of international \r\nlegitimacy. The positions advanced by those countries \r\nin the Security Council are merely a reiteration of the \r\npositions of the super-Powers in that organ. This has \r\nimpeded the Council from playing its important role \r\nin the maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nWe would like to see an enlargement of the \r\nCouncil, but we must be wary about which countries \r\nare to be chosen. When it comes to the election of \r\nA/71/PV.43 07/11/2016\r\n24/25 16-36737\r\nStates to the Security Council, the criteria of neutrality \r\nand objectivity must be observed. The Council, in its \r\ncurrent structure since its reform in 1965, has not been \r\nable to maintain international peace and security. It \r\nhas become an organ that establishes peacekeeping \r\noperations and deploys them to one or another location. \r\nThe evidence to support this thesis lies in the fact that \r\nconflicts have doubled in number since the end of the \r\nCold War. That is a true reflection of the Council’s \r\nfailure to maintain international peace and security, \r\nand of its neglect of many acts of aggression, especially \r\nthe invasions of Iraq, Lebanon and Gaza, as well as the \r\ncurrent events in Yemen, where the Council has failed to \r\nimplement its own resolutions regarding anti-terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, my delegation confirms that it will \r\nactively participate in the upcoming negotiations on \r\nSecurity Council reform in order to create a Council that \r\nis committed to the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nto humanitarian law, and that respects the sovereignty, \r\nindependence and integrity of countries and the \r\nprinciple of non-interference in their internal affairs.\r\nMr. Abulhasan (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMy delegation welcomes the letter of the President \r\nof the General Assembly dated 26 October 2016, \r\nwhich emphasizes the importance placed on the \r\nintergovernmental negotiations on Security Council \r\nreform. We also welcome the appointment of Ambassador \r\nIon Jinga and Ambassador Mohamed Khiari to co-chair \r\nthose negotiations. We are prepared to make a positive \r\ncontribution to those very important negotiations.\r\nAs of today, we have been debating the issue \r\nof Security Council reform for 23 years. Numerous \r\ninternational and regional initiatives have been \r\nlaunched with respect to the five pillars of the reform, \r\nas set out in decision 62/557. The goal has been to \r\nmove the intergovernmental negotiations forward, yet \r\ncertain points remain unclear. Greater political will is \r\nrequired, particularly on the part of the five permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council, in order to achieve \r\nour common objective.\r\nThe accelerating momentum of events in the world \r\nmust spur us to press on with the negotiations and to \r\nconsider rational positions. However, any decision \r\nto enlarge or otherwise modify the Security Council \r\nshould enjoy the broadest possible consensus. That is \r\nwhy Kuwait supports the code of conduct proposed \r\nby the Accountability, Coherence and Accountability \r\ngroup regarding the improvement of the Council’s \r\nworking methods, as well as the restriction of the use \r\nof the veto in the event of crimes against humanity. We \r\nalso welcome the joint proposal of France and Mexico \r\nfor a voluntary agreement on non-use of the veto in \r\ncases of mass atrocities.\r\nIn recent years, the position of Kuwait on Security \r\nCouncil reform has not changed. It is based on the \r\nfollowing principles.\r\nFirst, reform of the Security Council must be \r\naccompanied by the reform of the United Nations as a \r\nwhole in order to add complementarity and balance to \r\nthe work of the Organization. We must also improve \r\nthe relationship between the Security Council and \r\nother bodies so that the Council does not encroach \r\non the prerogatives of the General Assembly and the \r\nEconomic and Social Council. Its role should be limited \r\nto the maintenance of international peace and security. \r\nAll the ideas put forward regarding Security \r\nCouncil reform should be based on our shared aim to \r\nimprove the representation of Member States on that \r\norgan and to reflect the international reality, which has \r\nchanged significantly since the United Nations was \r\nfounded in 1945. It is also important to pursue efforts \r\nto improve the Council’s working methods and increase \r\ntheir transparency. In addition, the provisional rules \r\nof procedure must be replaced by permanent rules \r\nof procedure.\r\nSecondly, the use of the veto should be limited \r\nto cases covered by Chapter VII of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. Any increase in the number of \r\nseats should allow small States to be represented on \r\nthe Council and to participate in its work. We must \r\nalso not forget the rights of Arab and Muslim States \r\nto have a seat on the Council. In that regard, we call \r\nfor a permanent seat and a non-permanent seat to be \r\naccorded to Arab members.\r\nThirdly, the intergovernmental negotiations should \r\nbe the only means of achieving consensus on Security \r\nCouncil reform, in accordance with decision 62/557, \r\nwhich laid the basis for the negotiations. \r\nLastly, Kuwait believes that a successful reform \r\nof the Security Council will depend on the principles \r\nof f lexibility and compromise. Lack of consensus will \r\nonly undermine the credibility of those negotiations.\r\nMr. Khiari (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, on behalf of both myself and my colleague, \r\nAmbassador Ion Jinga. Permanent Representative \r\n07/11/2016 A/71/PV.43\r\n16-36737 25/25\r\nof Romania, I thank the President for the trust that \r\nhe has placed in us by designating us as co-Chairs \r\nof the intergovernmental negotiations on Security \r\nCouncil reform. We are aware that the responsibility \r\nis a heavy one and that the negotiations are extremely \r\nimportant to the President and the Member States. The \r\nprocess of reforming our Organization depends on the \r\nnegotiations, while dealing with today’s challenges to \r\ninternational peacee and security is in turn dependent \r\non that reform. I also thank my colleagues Ambassador \r\nTanin, Ambassador Rattray and Ambassador Lucas, \r\nwho chaired the negotiations during previous sessions.\r\nThe President’s letter addressed to Member States, \r\ndated 26 October 2016, emphasizes the importance of \r\ncontinuing to build on what was achieved during the \r\ntwo previous sessions with respect to intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations, as outlined in the 31 July 2015 text and its \r\nannex and the elements of convergence circulated on \r\n12 July 2016.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThe positions and proposals of Member States and \r\nnegotiating groups are, for the most part, known to all \r\nof us. What lies ahead in the short term is exploring \r\nany paths, means and options that will allow us to \r\nadvance in the negotiation process, which we want to be \r\ninclusive, trust-based and carried out in good faith. In \r\naccordance with the relevant resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly, we will lead the negotiations in a neutral, \r\nindependent manner that is open to the participation of \r\nall groups and Member States. Our goal continues to be \r\nto achieve together results that reflect and build on the \r\nthe achievements of recent years, results that respond \r\nto our aspirations to conduct a reform process leading \r\nto a Security Council that is more representative and \r\nefficient and more capable of meeting the challenges to \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn that regard, I recall that, as reaffirmed today by \r\nseveral delegations, progress in the process of reform \r\ndepends primarily on Member States. The success of \r\nour mission will therefore be largely dependent on \r\nthe resolve and determination of Member States and \r\nvarious negotiating groups to move forward in our joint \r\nendeavour. We welcome the broad support expressed \r\ntoday, as well as the disposition of Member States to \r\ncooperate closely with a view to reconciling their views \r\nand positions on various reform-related elements and \r\nissues. The goal is to work together in a coherent and \r\nf lexible manner in the framework of a dialogue that we \r\nwant to be constructive and productive.\r\nIn the coming days, we will begin to contact and \r\nconsult with Member States and negotiating groups. \r\nWe will update everybody as soon as possible on the \r\nnext steps. It goes without saying that our doors are \r\nopen to all Member States. We will do our utmost to \r\nfulfil our responsibility. The steady support of Member \r\nStates will be a certain help to us.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.45 p.m.\r\n"
