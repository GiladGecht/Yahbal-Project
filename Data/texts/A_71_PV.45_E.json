Those members will serve for a period of \r\nthree years beginning on 1 January 2017.\r\nConsequently, on the recommendation of the Chairs \r\nof the Groups of African States, Asia-Pacific States, \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States and Western \r\nEuropean and other States, the President has appointed \r\nAustria, Jamaica, Japan, Kenya, Morocco and the \r\nUnited States of America as members of the Committee \r\non Conferences for a period of three years beginning on \r\n1 January 2017. May I take it that the Assembly takes \r\nnote of those appointments?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to remind \r\nmembers that one seat from the Asia-Pacific States, for \r\na period of three years beginning on 1 January 2017, \r\nremains to be filled, and that two seats from the Latin \r\nAmerican and Caribbean States, for a period beginning \r\non the date of appointment and expiring on 31 December \r\n2018, still remain vacant. I urge those groups to submit \r\ntheir candidates as soon as possible.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of sub-item (g) of agenda \r\nitem 115.\r\n(h) Appointment of members of the Joint \r\nInspection Unit\r\nNotes by the Secretary-General (A/71/178 and \r\nA/71/178/Add.1)\r\nThe Acting President: Members will recall that at \r\nthe 29th plenary meeting, on 14 October, the Assembly \r\nselected the United States of America from among the \r\nGroup of Western European and other States to propose \r\na candidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit, \r\nfor a five-year term of office beginning on 1 January \r\n2017. This selection was made following the resignation \r\nof Mr. George Bartsiotas (United States of America).\r\nAs indicated in paragraph 2 of document A/71/178, \r\nthe General Assembly, by its resolution 61/238, decided \r\nthat beginning on 1 January 2008, the President of \r\nthe General Assembly, when drawing up the list of \r\ncountries that would be requested to propose candidates \r\nin accordance with paragraph 1 of article 3 of the \r\nstatute of the Unit, would invite Member States to \r\nsubmit the names of the countries and their respective \r\ncandidates simultaneously, on the understanding that \r\nthe candidates submitted were the candidates that the \r\nrespective Member States intended to propose, to the \r\nextent possible, for appointment by the Assembly in \r\naccordance with paragraph 2 of article 3 of the statute.\r\nAs indicated in documents A/71/178 and its \r\nAddendum 1, the General Assembly is required, during \r\nthe seventy-first session, to appoint the remaining four \r\nmembers to fill the vacancies in the Joint Inspection \r\nUnit that will arise from the expiration of the terms \r\nof office on 31 December 2017 of Mr. Gopinathan \r\nAchamkulangare (India), Mr. Gennady Tarasov \r\n(Russian Federation), Mr. Jean Wesley Cazeau (Haiti) \r\nand Ms. Sukai Elie Prom-Jackson (Gambia).\r\nAs also indicated in document A/71/178, in \r\naccordance with paragraph 1 of article 3 of the \r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, the President of \r\nthe General Assembly shall consult with Member \r\nStates to draw up a list of countries — in this case, \r\nfour countries — that would be requested to propose a \r\ncandidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nAfter holding the necessary consultations with the \r\nregional groups, I should like to communicate to the \r\nAssembly the information received from the Chair of \r\nthe Group of African States that of two candidates, the \r\nGambia and Libya, the Group has endorsed the Gambia \r\nas the country that will propose a candidate for the one \r\nvacancy from among the African States; from the Chair \r\nof the Group of Asia-Pacific States that the Group has \r\nendorsed India for the one vacancy from among the \r\nAsia-Pacific States; from the Chair of the Group of \r\nEastern European States that the Group has endorsed \r\nthe Russian Federation for the one vacancy from among \r\nthe Eastern European States; and from the Chair of the \r\nGroup of Latin American and Caribbean States that \r\nthe Group has endorsed Haiti for the one vacancy from \r\namong the Latin American and Caribbean States.\r\nAs the Groups of Asia-Pacific States, Eastern \r\nEuropean States and Latin American and Caribbean \r\nStates have each endorsed one country for one vacant \r\nA/71/PV.45 10/11/2016\r\n4/6 16-37487\r\nseat — India, the Russian Federation and Haiti, \r\nrespectively — those three countries will therefore be \r\nrequested to propose one candidate each for appointment \r\nto the Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nSince, however, from among the African States \r\nthere are two candidates for one vacancy, I should \r\nlike, in accordance with past practice, to consult with \r\nMember States through the procedure of holding an \r\nadvisory vote by secret ballot, to select one country from \r\namong the African States to be requested to propose a \r\ncandidate for appointment to the Joint Inspection Unit. \r\nAlthough this advisory vote would not be an election, \r\nwe would follow the rules of procedure of the Assembly \r\ngoverning elections. If there is no objection, may I take \r\nit that the General Assembly agrees to that procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with existing \r\npractice, the country receiving the greatest number \r\nof votes and not less than a majority of the votes of \r\nthose present and voting shall be the country selected \r\nto propose a candidate for appointment to the Joint \r\nInspection Unit. May I take it that the General Assembly \r\nalso agrees to that procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: I should like to remind \r\nmembers that the Assembly is not appointing members \r\nto the Joint Inspection Unit at this time. It is only \r\nselecting one country that will be requested to propose \r\na candidate, and therefore only the name of one country, \r\nnot the name of an individual, should appear on the \r\nballot papers.\r\nI should now like to repeat that for the one vacancy \r\nfrom among the African States, there are two candidates, \r\nthe Gambia and Libya. I should further like to point out \r\nthat from among the African States, Morocco already \r\nhas a national serving on the Joint Inspection Unit \r\nwhose term of office ends on 31 December 2020. The \r\nname of that State should therefore not appear on the \r\nballot paper.\r\nThe Assembly will now proceed to the selection of \r\none country from among the African States that will be \r\nrequested to propose a candidate to fill the vacancy in \r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order on \r\nthe actual conduct of the voting.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. Ballot papers will now be distributed. I \r\nshould like to request that representatives write on the \r\nballot paper the name of the one State for which they \r\nwish to vote. Ballot papers containing more than one \r\nname will be declared invalid. If a ballot paper contains \r\nthe name of a Member State that does not belong to the \r\nrelevant region, it will be declared invalid. Similarly, \r\nballot papers bearing the name of an individual will \r\nalso be declared invalid.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, Mr. Loko \r\n(Benin), Mrs. Coulibaly/Ouaattra (Burkina Faso), \r\nMr. Díaz Reina (Colombia), Ms. Rheindrayani \r\n(Indonesia), Ms. O’Brien (Ireland) and Ms. Oanţă \r\n(Romania) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 10.50 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.15 a.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nAfrican States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  185\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  3\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  182\r\nAbstentions:  2\r\nNumber of members voting:  180\r\nRequired simple majority:  91\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nGambia  93\r\nLibya  87\r\nHaving obtained the required majority and the \r\ngreatest number of votes, the Gambia was selected \r\nto propose a candidate for appointment to the Joint \r\nInspection Unit.\r\nThe Acting President: I thank the members for \r\ntheir advice and the tellers for their assistance.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 1 of article 3 of the \r\nstatute of the Joint Inspection Unit, the Gambia, India, \r\nHaiti and the Russian Federation will be requested to \r\nsubmit the names of candidates and the curricula vitae \r\nhighlighting the candidates’ relevant qualifications for \r\nthe tasks ahead.\r\n10/11/2016 A/71/PV.45\r\n16-37487 5/6\r\nI would like to remind members that, in accordance \r\nwith Assembly resolution 59/267, of 23 December \r\n2004, the candidates should have experience in at \r\nleast one of the following fields: oversight, audit, \r\ninspection, investigation, evaluation, finance, project \r\nevaluation, programme evaluation, human resources \r\nmanagement, management, public administration, \r\nmonitoring and programme performance, as well as \r\nknowledge of the United Nations system and its role in \r\ninternational relations.\r\nAfter holding the appropriate consultations \r\ndescribed in paragraph 2 of article 3 of the statute of \r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit, including consultations with \r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council \r\nand the Secretary-General, in his capacity as Chair \r\nof the United Nations System Chief Executive Board \r\nfor Coordination, I will submit the names of the \r\ncandidates to the Assembly for appointment to the Joint \r\nInspection Unit.\r\nThe Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (h) of agenda item 115.\r\nAgenda item 112\r\nElections to fill vacancies in principal organs\r\n(b) Election of eighteen members of the Economic \r\nand Social Council\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly will \r\nnow proceed to hold by-elections to elect members of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council, in accordance with rule \r\n140 of the rules of procedure. Members are reminded \r\nthat the election of 18 members of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council was held on 14 June 2016 during the \r\n104th plenary meeting of the seventieth session, in \r\nwhich the following 18 States were elected members of \r\nthe Council for a three-year term of office beginning \r\non 1 January 2017: Andorra, Azerbaijan, Benin, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Cameroon, Chad, China, Colombia, \r\nNorway, the Republic of Korea, the Russian Federation, \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Swaziland, Sweden, \r\nTajikistan, the United Arab Emirates, the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nI would first like to draw the attention of members \r\nto a letter dated 4 November 2016 from the Permanent \r\nRepresentative of San Marino to the United Nations, \r\ncirculated in document A/71/604. In his letter, the \r\nPermanent Representative of San Marino, in his capacity \r\nas Chair of the Group of Western European and other \r\nStates, refers to a note verbale dated 29 April 2016, \r\nsent by the Permanent Mission of Malta, announcing \r\nthat Greece will relinquish its seat on the Economic \r\nand Social Council at the end of 2016 for the remainder \r\nof its term, in favour of Turkey, and that Portugal will \r\nrelinquish its seat on the Council, also at the end of 2016 \r\nfor the remainder of its term, in favour of Spain. As a \r\nresult, two vacancies will occur and new members must \r\ntherefore be elected to fill the unexpired terms of office \r\nof Greece and Portugal, commencing on 1 January 2017 \r\nand expiring on 31 December 2017.\r\nIn accordance with paragraph 4 of General Assembly \r\nresolution 2847 (XXVI), adopted on 20 December 1971, \r\nand taking into account that the vacancies will occur \r\nfrom among the Western European and other States, \r\nthe new members should therefore be elected from that \r\nregional group. I should like to inform the Assembly \r\nthat the candidates that receive a two-thirds majority \r\nand the greatest number of votes by members present \r\nand voting will be declared elected.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nthat procedure?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with rule 92 \r\nof the rules of procedure, the election shall be held by \r\nsecret ballot, and there shall be no nominations. We \r\nshall now proceed accordingly.\r\nI should like to remind members that the following \r\nStates from among the Western European and other \r\nStates are currently represented on the Economic and \r\nSocial Council: Australia, Belgium, Finland, France, \r\nGermany, Ireland, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland, the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland \r\nand the United States of America. The names of those \r\n11 States should therefore not appear on the ballot.\r\nBefore we begin the voting process, I should like to \r\nremind members that pursuant to rule 88 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly, no representative \r\nshall interrupt the voting except on a point of order \r\non the actual conduct of the voting. In addition, ballot \r\npapers will be given only to the representative seated \r\ndirectly behind the country’s nameplate.\r\nWe shall now begin the voting process. Members \r\nare requested to remain seated until all ballots have \r\nbeen collected. I would like to remind members that \r\nthey are voting in the by-election for two seats for \r\nA/71/PV.45 10/11/2016\r\n6/6 16-37487\r\nthe Western European and other States. Ballot papers \r\nwill now be distributed. Representatives are requested \r\nto use only those ballot papers and to write on them \r\nthe names of the States for which they wish to vote. \r\nA ballot will be declared invalid if it contains more \r\nnames of Member States from the relevant region than \r\nthe number of seats assigned to it. A ballot will also \r\nbe declared invalid if any of the names of the Member \r\nStates on it do not belong to the Group of Western \r\nEuropean and other States.\r\nAt the invitation of the Acting President, Mr. Loko \r\n(Benin), Mrs. Coulibaly/Ouaattra (Burkina Faso), \r\nMr. Díaz Reina (Colombia), Ms. Rheindrayani \r\n(Indonesia), Ms. O’Brien (Ireland) and Ms. Oanţă \r\n(Romania) acted as tellers.\r\nA vote was taken by secret ballot.\r\nThe meeting was suspended at 11.35 a.m. and \r\nresumed at 11.55 a.m.\r\nThe Acting President: The result of the voting is \r\nas follows:\r\nWestern European and other States\r\nNumber of ballot papers:  180\r\nNumber of invalid ballots:  0\r\nNumber of valid ballots:  180\r\nAbstentions:  5\r\nNumber of members voting:  175\r\nRequired two-thirds majority:  117\r\nNumber of votes obtained:\r\nSpain  171\r\nTurkey  171\r\nHaving obtained the required two-thirds majority, \r\nSpain and Turkey were elected members of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council for a term of office \r\nbeginning on 1 January 2017 and ending on \r\n31 December 2017.\r\nThe Acting President: I congratulate Spain \r\nand Turkey on having been elected members of the \r\nEconomic and Social Council.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of sub-item (b) of agenda \r\nitem 112.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12 noon.\r\n"
