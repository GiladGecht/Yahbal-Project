The Commonwealth is aimed \r\nat developing mutually beneficial cooperation among \r\nmember States in political, economic, humanitarian, \r\ncultural, environmental and other areas. In line with \r\nresolution 48/237, of 24 March 1994, the Commonwealth \r\nwas accorded observer status in the General Assembly.\r\nThe central event of the year for the CIS was the \r\nmeeting of the Council of Heads of State in September \r\nin Bishkek. It is worth noting the four declarations \r\nadopted at the summit: a statement on the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the CIS, which assesses the activities of \r\nthe Commonwealth and considers the need to improve, \r\ndevelop and enhance the organization; a statement \r\non the outcome of the special session of the General \r\nAssembly on the world drug problem; a statement on \r\nfuture joint efforts to combat international terrorism; \r\nand a statement on the seventieth anniversary of the \r\ncompletion of the Nuremberg trials. Pursuant to the \r\ndecision of the CIS Heads of State, those statements \r\nwere circulated to the United Nations by the Kyrgyz \r\nchairmanship of the CIS as official documents.\r\nCooperation between the CIS and the entities of \r\nthe United Nations system continues to develop. The \r\nCIS Executive Committee liaises with a number of \r\nthe specialized agencies of the United Nations system, \r\nin particular the Economic and Social Commission \r\nfor Asia and the Pacific and the United Nations \r\nEducational, Scientific and Cultural Organization. The \r\nexecutive bodies of the United Nations Conference on \r\nTrade and Development and the Economic Commission \r\nfor Europe, as well as the United Nations Office at \r\nGeneva and the United Nations Office on Drugs and \r\nCrime, have established contractual relations with the \r\nCIS. Since July 2013, the CIS Executive Committee \r\nhas acted as a contact point for cooperation with the \r\nSecurity Council Committee established pursuant to \r\nSecurity Council resolution 1540 (2004). That list is far \r\nfrom complete.\r\nOn 28 October, the Russian presidency convened \r\na debate of the Security Council (see S/PV.7796) on \r\nthe issue of cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand regional organizations, such as the Collective \r\nSecurity Treaty Organization (CSTO), the Shanghai \r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n4/33 16-39494\r\nCooperation Organization (SCO) and the CIS with a \r\nview to supporting international peace and security. \r\nMost of those who spoke at that debate agreed that \r\nthe United Nations could not afford to try to cope \r\nwith contemporary threats to peace and security on its \r\nown. It is necessary instead to establish a collective \r\napproach that requires the consistent enhancement of \r\nthe cooperation capacity of the United Nations, as well \r\nas that of regional and subregional organizations, which \r\nhave a clearer understanding of both the overall and the \r\nlocal political situations on the ground. The CIS, the SCO \r\nand the CSTO were recognized for their contribution \r\nto ensuring peace and security at the international and \r\nregional levels. Speakers noted in particular the success \r\nof operations to combat terrorism, drug trafficking and \r\nillegal migration, and joint initiatives with the United \r\nNations in Central Asia and Afghanistan.\r\nAs Chair of the CIS for 2016, Kyrgyzstan is \r\ngrateful to the Secretary-General for his report on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\nand other organizations (A/71/160). The report covers \r\nthe two-year period from 2014 to 2016 and assesses the \r\nprogress of cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the relevant regional organizations, including the \r\nCIS. The activities and achievements outlined in the \r\nreport demonstrate the scale and breadth of United \r\nNations cooperation with its regional partners in the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in \r\nproviding humanitarian assistance and in promoting \r\ndevelopment and human rights.\r\nIn recent years, the solid cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and CIS has focused on addressing \r\ncommon problems relating to social, economic and \r\nhumanitarian issues at various levels. In order to \r\nenhance the practical component of that cooperation \r\nand increase its effectiveness, we need to strengthen the \r\nrelevant basis for such cooperation in order to promote \r\nthe development and deepening of relations between \r\nthe CIS and the agencies of the United Nations system.\r\nWe therefore submit for consideration the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Commonwealth of Independent States” \r\n(A/71/L.5). The draft resolution invites the specialized \r\nagencies and other organizations, programmes and \r\nfunds of the United Nations system, as well as the \r\ninternational financial institutions, to develop their \r\ncooperation with the CIS. Kyrgyzstan is convinced \r\nthat developing the cooperation between the United \r\nNations and regional and subregional organizations, \r\nincluding the CIS, will make it possible to completely \r\nand effectively address a wide range of areas, exchange \r\nbest practices in various fields and bring them into \r\npractical application.\r\nIn conclusion, on behalf of the Kyrgyz delegation, I \r\nwould like to express our thanks to the States involved \r\nfor their participation in the work on the text of the \r\ndraft resolution submitted today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Belarus to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/71/L.7.\r\nMr. Dapkiunas (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): \r\nBelarus, as the current Chair of the Collective Security \r\nTreaty Organization (CSTO), has the honour to submit \r\nto the General Assembly draft resolution A/71/L.7, on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the CSTO. \r\nThe sponsors are Armenia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, \r\nthe Russian Federation, Tajikistan and Belarus.\r\nThe CSTO is an important partner of the international \r\ncommunity in promoting peace, security and progress \r\non the path towards sustainable development. Today, \r\nthe CSTO is a multifaceted organization with a wide \r\nrange of capabilities to address contemporary threats \r\nand challenges. Cooperation between the CSTO and \r\nthe United Nations is based on a number of documents, \r\nincluding the joint declaration of 2010 on cooperation \r\nbetween the secretariats of the two Organizations and \r\nthe 2012 memorandum of understanding between the \r\nCSTO secretariat and the United Nations Department \r\nof Peacekeeping Operations.\r\nThe draft resolution welcomes the contribution of \r\nthe CSTO in areas of international cooperation such \r\nas combating terrorism and organized transnational \r\ncrime, the fight against drug and weapons trafficking, \r\nillegal migration, human trafficking and dealing with \r\nthe consequences of natural and man-made disasters. It \r\nalso highlights the development of CSTO peacekeeping \r\ncapacities. Collective actions taken in those areas are \r\nin line with the principles of the United Nations and \r\ncontribute to the achievement of its goals.\r\nThe CSTO is ready to initiate mechanisms for \r\ncooperation on all those issues. I should like to cite \r\none example of such cooperation in practice. Last \r\nyear, in order to address the drug-distribution channels \r\nemanating from Afghanistan, the CSTO conducted \r\noperations that involved 25 non-CSTO States Members \r\nof the United Nations. Such collaboration confirms the \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 5/33\r\npractical contribution of the CSTO to strengthening \r\nregional and international security.\r\nThe draft resolution calls for both organizations \r\nto continue exploring potential ways to increase \r\ncooperation in the field of peacekeeping. We look \r\nforward, during the Belarus chairmanship of the CSTO, \r\nto the qualitative development of such cooperation, \r\nincluding on the basis of new ideas, for harnessing the \r\npeacekeeping potential of CSTO member countries \r\ntogether with United Nations peacekeeping operations.\r\nWe are grateful to the delegations of the countries \r\nthat participated in the consultations on the draft \r\nresolution and look forward to future constructive \r\ncooperation in the building of partnerships between \r\nthe United Nations and regional organizations, \r\nincluding the CSTO.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina to introduce draft resolution A/71/L.9.\r\nMr. Vukašinović (Bosnia and Herzegovina): As \r\nthe country currently holding the chairmanship of \r\nthe Central European Initiative (CEI), Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina has the honour to introduce, under agenda \r\nitem 126, the draft resolution entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and Central European \r\nInitiative”, contained in document A/71/L.9.\r\nThe draft resolution submitted today reaffirms \r\nour strong commitment to regional and subregional \r\ncooperation as the vital precondition for successful \r\ninternational cooperation. Addressing many challenges \r\nin today’s ever-changing world requires constantly \r\nrenewing partnerships among regional organizations \r\nand between regional organizations and the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Central European Initiative — the largest and \r\noldest forum for regional cooperation in Central, East \r\nand South-East Europe — has always considered cross-\r\nborder, regional and interregional cooperation to be \r\nthe most valuable instruments for ensuring regional \r\nstability and security and for exploring the potential \r\nfor trade and economic partnerships. The CEI focuses \r\nparticularly on the areas of common interest between its \r\nmember States such as agriculture, transport, energy, \r\nassistance to small and medium-sized enterprises, \r\nmunicipal infrastructure and services, banking, \r\ninsurance, institution-building and capacity-building.\r\nBy focusing on sustainable development and \r\ninterconnectivity at the regional level, the Initiative is \r\ncontributing to the realization of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. That was confirmed during \r\nthe June 2016 annual meeting of ministers for foreign \r\naffairs of the CEI member States held in Banja Luka \r\nand organized by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina. At that meeting, the Ministers \r\nreiterated their full commitment to good-neighbourly \r\nrelations, the rule of law, a free market economy and \r\nrespect for human rights and fundamental freedoms, \r\nwhich are preconditions for stability, security \r\nand development.\r\nThe continuing commitment of the European \r\nBank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) in \r\nsupporting the economies of CEI countries and their \r\nregional integration is living proof of the importance \r\nof the partnership between the CEI and the EBRD. The \r\nCEI member States express their great appreciation for \r\nthe contributions of the Central European Initiative \r\nTrust Fund, financed entirely by Italy, as well as the \r\nKnow-how Exchange Programme, financed by Austria \r\nand Italy.\r\nThe CEI is placing new emphasis in its cooperation \r\nwith the most important European institutions and \r\norganizations, above all the European Union, as \r\nwell as the Organization for Economic Cooperation \r\nand Development, the Council of Europe and the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe. \r\nI would also like to underline that the CEI continues \r\nto strengthen its cooperation with other regional \r\ninitiatives, such as the Adriatic and Ionian Initiative, \r\nthe Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization, \r\nthe Council of the Baltic Sea States, the South-East \r\nEuropean Cooperation Process and its operational \r\narm, the Regional Cooperation Council. The focus \r\nis on identifying the most efficient and productive \r\naction, avoiding duplication and properly managing \r\nresources in order to reach our shared goals. In that \r\nsense, the Initiative is confirming its role as a bridge \r\nbetween macroregions.\r\nAllow me to express our sincere thanks to the \r\nCEI secretariat and the CEI member States for their \r\nassistance and cooperation in preparing the draft \r\nresolution. Finally, I would like to call on the States \r\nmembers of the General Assembly to adopt the draft \r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Central European Initiative without a vote.\r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n6/33 16-39494\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Kazakhstan to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/71/L.11.\r\nMr. Kamaldinov (Kazakhstan): As we commence \r\nthis important meeting, I welcome the recent release of \r\nthe Secretary-General’s report on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and regional and other organizations \r\n(A/71/160), which provides insights into the latest \r\ntrends in the collaborative efforts of the United Nations \r\nto fulfil the mandates of its Charter.\r\nToday, on behalf of the States members of the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO) — the \r\nPeople’s Republic of China, the Republic of Kazakhstan, \r\nthe Republic of Kyrgyzstan, the Russian Federation, \r\nthe Republic of Tajikistan and the Republic of \r\nUzbekistan — I have the honour to submit for the \r\nAssembly’s consideration draft resolution A/71/L.11, \r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Shanghai Cooperation Organization”. The \r\ndraft resolution is based on resolution 64/183, of \r\n18 December 2009; resolution 65/124, of 13 December \r\n2010; resolution 67/15, of 19 November 2012; and \r\nresolution 69/11, of 11 November 2014.\r\nThis year, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization \r\ncelebrates its fifteenth anniversary. In the decade and \r\na half of its existence, the organization has enjoyed \r\n12 years of observer status in the General Assembly. \r\nDuring that time, the SCO has attained a commendable \r\nprofile in its standing as a reputed international and \r\nregional organization. The SCO is an influential \r\nand effective factor in strengthening mutual trust \r\nand ensuring security and stability in contemporary \r\ninternational relations. Its activities are also aimed at \r\nsustainable development, particularly in the spheres of \r\neconomy, education, energy, environmental protection, \r\ninformation and communication technologies and other \r\nareas. The organization contributes to effective counter-\r\nterrorism cooperation, including through the regional \r\nanti-terrorist structure, and promotes the fight against \r\ndrug trafficking and other forms of transnational crime.\r\nSCO member States support the swift attainment \r\nof peace and stability in Afghanistan — an important \r\nfactor in maintaining and strengthening security in \r\nthe region. The draft resolution before us is the result \r\nof informal consultations convened by the Republic \r\nof Kazakhstan in its capacity as a current chair of \r\nthe organization.\r\nFinally, I would like to thank all of the delegations \r\nthat participated in the deliberations with sincere \r\ncommitment and engagement. Their constructive \r\ncontribution to strengthening the existing ties between \r\nthe United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization has been significant.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Azerbaijan to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/71/L.12.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): In our capacity as 2016 \r\nchair of the Organization for Democracy and Economic \r\nDevelopment — GUAM, the delegation of Azerbaijan \r\nhas the honour to introduce, on behalf of the sponsors \r\nand under agenda item 126 (x), draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.12, entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Organization for Democracy and \r\nEconomic Development — GUAM”.\r\nGUAM is an international regional organization \r\nconsisting of four member States, namely, Azerbaijan, \r\nGeorgia, the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine. This \r\nmultilateral format of cooperation was established on \r\n10 October 1997, when the Presidents of the four States \r\nsigned a joint communiqué. Since then GUAM has been \r\ntransformed into a full-f ledged international regional \r\norganization, with a well-institutionalized structure \r\nand permanent secretariat, as well as with a distinct \r\nvocation of promoting democracy and the economic \r\ndevelopment of its member States.\r\nGUAM has established and continues to develop \r\nmutually beneficial cooperation and dialogue with \r\nother international organizations and partner countries. \r\nIn resolution 58/85, of 8 January 2004, the General \r\nAssembly granted observer status to GUAM. On \r\n17 December 2012, at its sixty-seventh session, and \r\non 2 April 2015, at its sixty-ninth session, the General \r\nAssembly adopted by consensus resolutions 67/109 \r\nand 69/271, respectively, each entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Organization for \r\nDemocracy and Economic Development — GUAM”.\r\nOver the period since the adoption of the latest \r\nresolution, further efforts have been undertaken to \r\ncontinue cooperation with the relevant United Nations \r\nagencies, as well as to explore further opportunities \r\nfor dialogue and interaction across a broad agenda \r\nof mutual interest and concerns. This year’s draft \r\nresolution, which is based on the previous resolutions \r\nof the General Assembly on the topic, acknowledges \r\nthe efforts of the Organization for Democracy and \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 7/33\r\nEconomic Development — GUAM aimed at developing \r\npartnership relations with the United Nations and its \r\nMember States. It also takes note of the activity of \r\nGUAM targeted on promoting regional cooperation in \r\nvarious areas.\r\nThe draft resolution emphasizes the importance of \r\nstrengthening dialogue, cooperation and coordination \r\nbetween the United Nations system and GUAM, \r\nand urges the specialized agencies, components, \r\norganizations, programmes and funds of the United \r\nNations to cooperate and develop direct contacts \r\nwith GUAM for the joint implementation of projects \r\naimed at the attainment of common objectives. We \r\nare confident that the adoption of the draft resolution \r\nwill further contribute to developing cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and GUAM, promoting the \r\npurposes and principles enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, and implementing the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nThe draft resolution has been discussed in the \r\ncourse of informal consultations in an open and \r\ntransparent manner. I would like to thank delegations \r\nfor their constructive approach and support for the \r\ndraft resolution as well as those delegations that have \r\nsponsored it. I look forward to the adoption of the draft \r\nresolution by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Algeria to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/71/L.6.\r\nMr. Bessedik (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): It is \r\na pleasure, on behalf of the League of Arab States, \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/71/L.6, entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nLeague of Arab States”, sponsored by Algeria, Bahrain, \r\nthe Comoros, Djibouti, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, \r\nLebanon, Libya, Mauritania, Morocco, Oman, Qatar, \r\nSaudi Arabia, Somalia, the Sudan, Tunisia, the United \r\nArab Emirates and Yemen, as well as El Salvador, \r\nPoland, Spain and Sweden.\r\nThe draft resolution is based on the important \r\ncollaborative principle reflected in Chapter VIII of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations, whereby the United \r\nNations is encouraged to cooperate with regional and \r\ninternational organizations in areas of common interest, \r\nin particular the maintenance of international peace and \r\nsecurity. Furthermore, the draft resolution welcomes \r\nthe amendment to the cooperation agreement between \r\nthe League of Arab States and the United Nations, dated \r\nSeptember 2016, and appeals for cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States. In that \r\ncontext, a meeting was held in 2015 in Cairo in which \r\nthe League of Arab States focused on the repercussions \r\nof undervaluing human rights. A thirteenth meeting, \r\nheld in Geneva in May 2016 between the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States, considered in detail the \r\nchallenges to international peace and security and the \r\ncurrent regional and international difficulties that need \r\nto be overcome, particularly in the recent period, and \r\nrequire enhanced cooperation.\r\nBecause that cooperation needs to be broadened, the \r\ndraft resolution calls for enhanced cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States, \r\nwhich is most important. Indeed, the draft resolution \r\ncalls for broader cooperation at all levels between the \r\nUnited Nations, its specialized agencies and the League \r\nof Arab States in order to achieve our joint goals. For \r\nthat reason, I call on the General Assembly to adopt the \r\ndraft resolution without a vote.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, who will introduce draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.14.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): I have \r\nthe honour, on behalf of the members of the Economic \r\nCooperation Organization (ECO), to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.14, entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization”, dated 14 November 2016, which is based \r\non resolution 69/111, on the same topic.\r\nRegional cooperation is now a prevailing paradigm \r\nand a phenomenon of interest in international \r\nrelations. Cooperation among neighbouring and \r\nregional countries within the context of institutional \r\nframeworks such as the ECO has proved its value for \r\nthe economic development and prosperity of peoples. \r\nThe ECO, which was established in 1964, has become \r\na dynamic and outward-looking regional organization \r\nand has been successful in forging a range of economic \r\nand non-economic cooperation arrangements.\r\nAs one of the largest groups in the world, the \r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization spans a territory of \r\n8 million square kilometres, with more than 450 million \r\ninhabitants. The ECO regions cover 10 countries in \r\nWest and East Asia, as well as Central Asia and the \r\nCaucasus, connecting Europe to China and Russia \r\nto the Persian Gulf. ECO is now functioning on two \r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n8/33 16-39494\r\ntracks, namely, as a regional cooperation framework to \r\ncomplement the individual development efforts of its \r\nmember States and as a platform to translate the global \r\nagenda into actions at the regional level.\r\nIn accomplishing those two functions, the ECO \r\nhas been expanding partnerships and cooperation \r\narrangements with potential partners. The United \r\nNations system has always been the prime target of \r\nECO outreach policy to help to implement the global \r\nagenda in our part of the world. That is why we are of \r\nthe view that the United Nations-ECO relationship, as \r\nconsolidated by the draft resolution before us, not only \r\nhelps the ECO to utilize the capacities, resources and \r\nknowledge of United Nations agencies in the interests of \r\nECO member States, but also offers the United Nations \r\nsystem the regional capacities, networks and platforms \r\ndeveloped by the ECO during the past three decades.\r\nThe ECO will soon begin to implement its \r\nnew vision for the next 10 years, which has been \r\ndrafted in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. The new vision, guided by regional needs \r\nand requirements, as well by the global development \r\nagenda, will focus on cooperation in areas such as \r\neconomic growth and productivity, trade expansion, \r\nenhanced connectivity, energy efficiency, and human \r\ndevelopment and social welfare. It is encouraging to \r\nnote that the draft resolution will be in place during \r\nthe first two years of the new ECO vision, enabling the \r\nECO and its member States to benefit from an enhanced \r\nrelationship with United Nations funds, programmes \r\nand specialized agencies while implementing our \r\nvisions, plans and programmes.\r\nThe draft document has been prepared after \r\ncontinuous engagement with and receiving input from \r\nECO member States. The document is based on the \r\nlessons learned from the implementation of ECO Vision \r\n2015, adopted in 2005 in Astana. The draft Vision 2025 \r\naims to address the emerging needs and requirements \r\nfor economic development of the ECO, its member \r\nStates and the region as a whole, endeavouring to focus \r\non core matters such as trade, transport, connectivity \r\nand energy as called for by the needs and aspirations \r\nof member States. A comprehensive framework for \r\nimplementation and periodic review has been included \r\nso as to ensure its optimal implementation.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto express, on behalf of ECO member States, our \r\nsincere thanks to all States Members of the United \r\nNations that participated actively and constructively \r\nin the consultations on the draft resolution and showed \r\nflexibility throughout the process, without which no \r\nagreement would have been possible. In view of that, I \r\nwould like to request that all Member States lend their \r\ncontinued support to this year’s draft resolution and \r\nadopt it by consensus, as in previous years.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Estonia to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/71/L.15.\r\nMr. Jürgenson (Estonia): In accordance with the \r\nmandate given by the Committee of Ministers of the \r\nCouncil of Europe to the chairmanship of the Council of \r\nEurope, I have the honour to introduce draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.15, entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Council of Europe”.\r\nEstonia assumed the chairmanship of the Council \r\nof Europe in May and concludes it tomorrow, so it is \r\nsymbolic to present this draft resolution to the General \r\nAssembly at the end of our term. The draft resolution is \r\nsponsored by the 52 countries listed in the document, \r\nwhich to our knowledge is the highest number for this \r\ndraft resolution on cooperation.\r\nCooperation between the Council of Europe and \r\nthe United Nations started as far back as 1951 with \r\nthe agreement between the secretariats of the two \r\norganizations. In 1989, the General Assembly granted \r\nthe Council of Europe an invitation to participate as an \r\nobserver in its sessions. Today, the Council of Europe \r\nworks closely with a large number of United Nations \r\nbodies. Since 2000, and every second year since 2004, \r\na resolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Council of Europe has been adopted. Those \r\nresolutions have demonstrated that the collaboration \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Council of Europe \r\nis well established and has evolved and deepened \r\nover time.\r\nThe draft resolution under consideration today \r\nincludes important updates with regard to the work \r\nundertaken by the Council of Europe and the United \r\nNations in the areas of common interest since the \r\nadoption of resolution 69/83, in 2014. The draft \r\nresolution encourages further cooperation in the \r\nfields of the protection and promotion of human \r\nrights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law; \r\nthe fight against discrimination and intolerance; the \r\nadvancement of gender equality and the fight against \r\nviolence against women; the prevention of torture, \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 9/33\r\ninhuman or degrading treatment or punishment; the \r\nprotection of the rights of children; the fight against \r\nterrorism, transnational organized crime, cybercrime, \r\ncorruption and trafficking in human beings; as well as \r\nin the fields of Internet governance, the information \r\nsociety and fostering intercultural dialogue. The draft \r\nresolution also recognizes the effective implementation \r\nof the outcomes of relevant international conferences \r\nand legal instruments.\r\nLet me assure members that the Council of Europe \r\nremains committed to the promotion of its three main \r\npillars: human rights, democracy and the rule of law. \r\nIt stands ready for dialogue and partnership aimed at \r\nadvancing its core values and achieving greater synergy \r\nwith the United Nations.\r\nTo conclude, I would like to thank all members \r\nof the Council of Europe and the observer States for \r\ntheir support during the Estonian chairmanship, \r\nas well as all delegations here in New York for their \r\nconstructive engagement and the f lexibility shown \r\nduring consultations on the draft resolution. We hope \r\nthat the draft resolution will be adopted by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Serbia to introduce \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.16/Rev.1.\r\nMr. Milanović (Serbia): On behalf of the States \r\nmembers of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization (BSEC), I have the honour to introduce \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.16/Rev.1, submitted under \r\nsub-item (o) of agenda item 126 and entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the Black \r\nSea Economic Cooperation Organization”. I wish to \r\nthank all BSEC member States for agreeing on a joint \r\ntext of the draft resolution, which will further contribute \r\nto enhancing cooperation with the United Nations and \r\nits specialized agencies, funds and programmes, as \r\nwell as to strengthening the relevance and visibility of \r\nthe activities undertaken for the benefit of the countries \r\nof the wider Black Sea area.\r\nI also wish to thank the sponsors of the draft \r\nresolution for their valuable support for the noble \r\naims and objectives of the oldest, most representative \r\nand institutionally mature organization promoting \r\nmultilateral economic cooperation in the region. BSEC \r\nwill mark its twenty-fifth anniversary in 2017.\r\nThe draft resolution — which I sincerely hope will \r\nbe adopted without a vote again this year — is aimed at \r\nbuilding on a relationship that is fully complementary \r\nto the purposes of the United Nations in achieving \r\ninternational cooperation in solving problems of an \r\neconomic, social or humanitarian nature, and is in \r\naccordance with the promotion of the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations in terms of regional \r\ncooperation, as set out in the relevant Articles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations.\r\nIt also seeks to promote the interest of the Black \r\nSea Economic Cooperation Organization in the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, bearing in mind the interconnectivity and \r\nmutually beneficial and supporting role that regional \r\nand subregional frameworks can play in facilitating the \r\neffective translation of sustainable development policies \r\ninto concrete action at the national level. Furthermore, \r\nit will also help to promote fruitful cooperation in \r\ndeveloping practical and goal-oriented projects with \r\nthe aim of implementing sustainable development \r\nstrategies based on a balanced and harmonious \r\nrelationship linking social needs, economic activities \r\nand environmental protection.\r\nIn implementing regional projects for the \r\nsustainable development of the region, it will, inter alia, \r\nstrive to focus on renewable energy, energy efficiency, \r\ngreen technologies, developing small and medium-\r\nsized enterprises, improving regional and municipal \r\ninfrastructure, and increasing the export potential \r\nof the region’s States. It will also support numerous \r\nongoing projects with a variety of partners from the \r\nUnited Nations family in areas as diverse and broad as \r\nstrengthening transport infrastructure, the preservation \r\nof the environment, enhancing criminal justice systems \r\nand fostering common values through the promotion \r\nof understanding and reconciliation among cultures \r\nglobally and regionally.\r\nAs Chairman-in-Office of BSEC, Serbia has \r\nendeavoured to contribute to the improvement of \r\neconomic cooperation among the countries of the region \r\nin areas of mutual interest, building on the activities \r\nand projects of the previous chairmanships. Its main \r\npriorities have been the development of economic \r\ncooperation, particularly in the areas of trade and \r\ntourism; cooperation in the area of transport, on which \r\na ministerial meeting was recently held in Belgrade; the \r\nstrengthening of cooperation with other international \r\nand regional organizations and initiatives, striving to \r\nachieve synergies wherever possible; and reform of the \r\norganization, which is aimed at making it more project-\r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n10/33 16-39494\r\noriented, efficient and functional. It has also sought \r\nto foster cooperation in various other areas, such \r\nas energy, tourism, education, science, technology, \r\nculture, environmental protection, customs, health care, \r\npharmaceuticals and combating crime, among others, \r\nin the context of the interrelatedness of those issues \r\nand their importance for the economic development of \r\nBSEC member States. Serbia has remained open to new \r\nideas and suggestions by other BSEC member States, \r\nobservers and sectorial-dialogue partners on modalities \r\nto further enhance cooperation.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate the hope \r\nthat the draft resolution will garner the support of the \r\nmembers of this body, as has been the case in previous \r\nyears, and that, once adopted, it will contribute to \r\nthe strengthening of cooperation between the United \r\nNations and BSEC.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the representative of Rwanda to \r\nintroduce draft resolution A/71/L.17.\r\nMs. Feza (Rwanda): I am grateful for the \r\nopportunity to introduce draft resolution A/71/L.17, \r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe International Criminal Police Organization”.\r\nRwanda has been a member of INTERPOL since \r\n1974, and Australia, as a co-facilitator, has been a \r\nmember of INTERPOL since 1948. Both countries \r\nhave worked closely with INTERPOL over the years, \r\nwith Rwanda having successfully hosted INTERPOL’s \r\nGeneral Assembly in Kigali this year. Given our close \r\ncooperation with INTERPOL and our strong belief in \r\nINTERPOL’s activities, goals and objectives, we are \r\npleased to introduce the draft resolution to the General \r\nAssembly, which we believe to be the next rational \r\nstep in the history of cooperation between the two \r\norganizations. The INTERPOL Secretary General, \r\nMr. Jürgen Stock, who is present here today, will be \r\naddressing representatives in due course. However, \r\nI would like to take a few minutes of members’ \r\ntime to provide them with some of the background \r\ninformation on the relationship of long date between \r\nthe two organizations.\r\nThe INTERPOL Liaison Office to the United \r\nNations in New York was established in October \r\n2004 to raise awareness of INTERPOL’s services \r\nwithin the United Nations community and encourage \r\nthe use of its available tools and networks, as well as \r\nidentify areas of common interest and opportunities \r\nfor increased cooperation and coordination. Indeed, \r\nsince its inception, the Office has taken the lead role \r\nin further enhancing INTERPOL’s cooperation with \r\nUnited Nations entities directly involved in activities \r\nrelated to law enforcement. INTERPOL carries out \r\nall its activities in accordance with its own rules and \r\nregulations in full respect of member States’ sovereignty \r\nand consistent with each member State’s domestic laws \r\nand regulations.\r\nThe goal of the draft resolution on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and INTERPOL is to \r\nformally acknowledge the cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and INTERPOL in assisting States \r\nMembers of the United Nations  that are also INTERPOL \r\nmember countries to prevent and respond to crime and \r\nimprove their law-enforcement capabilities upon their \r\nrequest and within the framework of their respective \r\nmandates. It also fully recognizes and encourages \r\nthe strengthening of cooperation in areas of common \r\ninterest — as mentioned in the third preambular \r\nparagraph — namely,\r\n“tackling terrorism, including preventing foreign \r\nterrorist fighter travel and combating transnational \r\ncrime, in particular transnational organized crime, \r\nincluding smuggling of migrants, trafficking in \r\npersons, drug trafficking, intentional and unlawful \r\ndestruction of cultural heritage and trafficking in \r\ncultural property, piracy, illicit trade in small arms \r\nand light weapons, illicit trafficking in nuclear, \r\nbiological, chemical and radiological materials, \r\ncybercrime, corruption and money-laundering and \r\ncrimes that affect the environment, such as illicit \r\ntrafficking in wildlife”.\r\nTo date, the General Assembly has adopted specific \r\nresolutions involving 23 observer organizations, such \r\nas the Organization for Security and Cooperation \r\nin Europe, the Council of Europe, the Economic \r\nCooperation Organization, the African Union and the \r\nLeague of Arab States, among others.\r\nFinally, I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto thank members of the core group that have been \r\nworking closely with Australian and Rwanda in \r\ndrawing up the draft resolution. I also extend my thanks \r\nto all 1smun that actively participated in the series of \r\nnegotiation meetings and to those that sponsored the \r\ndraft resolution. Their valuable contributions, guidance \r\nand support on the first draft resolution on cooperation \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 11/33\r\nbetween the United Nations and INTERPOL have been \r\ngreatly appreciated.\r\nMr. Vieira (Brazil): I have the honour to speak \r\non behalf of the Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries (CPLP), the member States of which are \r\nAngola, Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Equatorial \r\nGuinea, Mozambique, Portugal, Sao Tome and Principe, \r\nTimor-Leste and my own country, Brazil.\r\nThe Community of Portuguese-speaking Countries \r\nheld its eleventh summit meeting on October 31 and \r\n1 November in Brasilia. On that occasion, CPLP Heads \r\nof State and Government welcomed the selection \r\nof António Guterres as the next Secretary-General \r\nin the most transparent process in the history of \r\nthe Organization. We also highlighted that the \r\nSecretary-General-designate is the first citizen of \r\na Portuguese-speaking country to occupy such a \r\ndistinguished position.\r\nWe were honoured that Secretary-General-designate \r\nGuterres accepted the invitation of President Michel \r\nTemer of Brazil to attend the eleventh CPLP summit \r\nmeeting in Brasilia. We concur with Secretary-\r\nGeneral-designate Gutteres that the CPLP has a \r\npositive role to play globally in that it is committed \r\nto the same general principles as those that underlie \r\nthe functioning of the United Nations. Indeed, as \r\nenshrined in its founding document, the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries shares a commitment \r\nto the primacy of peace, democracy, the rule of law, \r\nhuman rights and social justice.\r\nThe year 2016 marks the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe CPLP, which we celebrated on 17 July. Over the past \r\n20 years, the Community has managed to consolidate \r\nitself as a platform for dialogue and political and \r\ndiplomatic cooperation among Portuguese-speaking \r\ncountries and between the CPLP and the rest of the \r\nworld. Looking ahead, CPLP members believe that \r\nmobility is an essential tool for progressively building a \r\nsense of CPLP citizenship.\r\nThe implementation of the Agenda 2030 for \r\nSustainable Development — the central theme of \r\nthis session of the General Assembly — will require \r\nconcerted cooperation among all relevant stakeholders. \r\nThat is an area where the CPLP and the United Nations \r\ncan be strategic partners. The CPLP is ready to promote \r\npolitical dialogue and the exchange of experiences \r\nand cooperation to support the full implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in all \r\nPortuguese-speaking countries. The very theme of the \r\neleventh CPLP summit meeting, in Brasilia, “CPLP \r\nand the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, \r\nreflects that priority.\r\nAllow me to emphasize the important role of \r\nregional and subregional groups in peacebuilding \r\nefforts. As Member States are aware, Angola, a member \r\nof our Community, co-facilitated, with Australia, \r\nresolution 70/262, entitled “Review of the United \r\nNations peacebuilding architecture”, and Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2282 (2016), on the same subject, \r\nwhich acknowledge the importance of enhanced \r\npartnerships and cooperation between the United \r\nNations and regional and subregional organizations.\r\nBrazil currently holds the chairmanships of both \r\nthe CPLP and the Guinea-Bissau configuration of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission. We intend to increase \r\ncooperation between those two bodies, in line with \r\nthe mandate established in resolution 70/262 and the \r\nprinciples of the CPLP. The CPLP has long been engaged \r\nin peacebuilding efforts. The Community is part of the \r\nforum on Guinea-Bissau that includes representatives \r\nof the United Nations, the African Union, the Economic \r\nCommunity of West African States (ECOWAS) and the \r\nEuropean Union and works to promote a constructive \r\ndialogue between the Bissau-Guinean authorities \r\nand national and international stakeholders. In that \r\nregard, we commend the valuable work carried out by \r\nthe former Special Representative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in Guinea-Bissau, Mr. Miguel Trovoada. \r\nCPLP members are confident that the current Special \r\nRepresentative, Mr. Modibó Touré, will effectively \r\ndischarge his responsibilities.\r\nAs highlighted by the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nthe swift implementation of the six-point agreement, \r\nbrokered by a high-level ECOWAS mission to Guinea-\r\nBissau on 10 September, is urgently needed. The \r\nrelevant regional and subregional actors should remain \r\nunited in supporting the diplomatic efforts undertaken \r\nby ECOWAS and in supporting Guinea-Bissau in its \r\nendeavours to achieve stabilization. The Executive \r\nSecretary of the CPLP will continue to follow up on \r\nthe political situation in Guinea-Bissau and promote \r\nconsultation and interaction with that country’s \r\nauthorities and international and regional partners.\r\nAs mentioned in the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral (A/71/160), the CPLP and the International \r\nLabour Organization (ILO) have cooperated closely \r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n12/33 16-39494\r\nwith regard to the ILO International Programme on \r\nthe Elimination of Child Labour. Following the CPLP \r\ndeclaration of 2016 as the Year against Child Labour, \r\na number of workshops were held with a view to \r\nundertaking joint activities aimed at preventing and \r\neliminating that practice.\r\nThe Secretary-General also recalls in his report \r\nCPLP cooperation with the United Nations Office \r\non Drugs and Crime on the implementation of the \r\nCPLP Lisbon Action Plan for Establishing Common \r\nMeasures to Prevent and Combat Trafficking in \r\nHuman Beings, and its partnership with the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization of the United Nations for the \r\nimplementation of a technical cooperation programme \r\nin support of the CPLP Regional Strategy for Food \r\nSecurity and Nutrition.\r\nWe welcome the adoption, on 6 July 2015, of \r\nresolution 69/311, on cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Community of Portuguese-speaking \r\nCountries. This year’s draft resolution stresses the \r\nimportance of continuing to strengthen cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations, its agencies, entities, \r\nprogrammes and other international, regional and \r\nsubregional organizations.\r\nAround 280 million people speak Portuguese \r\nin the world today, which makes it the fifth most \r\nspoken language in the world, the third most spoken \r\nin the western hemisphere and the most spoken in the \r\nsouthern hemisphere. Our goal is to continue promoting \r\nthe Portuguese language, including within the United \r\nNations, as a means to promote cultural diversity \r\namong the Portuguese-speaking peoples and as a means \r\nof projecting their cultural values internationally in an \r\nopen and universal fashion. In that context, we wish \r\nto highlight the work of the Portuguese Unit of United \r\nNations Radio in broadcasting issues of concern to the \r\nUnited Nations and Portuguese-speaking people.\r\nIn my concluding remarks, I wish to reiterate that \r\nthe CPLP is ready to engage with the United Nations \r\nsystem, its programmes, funds and agencies in order to \r\nstrengthen mutual collaboration.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ngive the f loor to the observer of the European Union.\r\nMr. Van Den Akker (European Union): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the European Union \r\nand its member States. The candidate countries the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization \r\nand Association Process and potential candidate \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina; and the European Free \r\nTrade Association country Liechtenstein, member of \r\nthe European Economic Area as well as Ukraine, the \r\nRepublic of Moldova and Georgia, align themselves \r\nwith this statement.\r\nWe welcome the coming adoption today of draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.15, entitled “Cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe”, which aims \r\nto enhance cooperation between the two institutions. \r\nSince the signing in 1951 of the agreement between the \r\nCouncil of Europe and the Secretariat of the United \r\nNations, the cooperative arrangements between the \r\nrespective secretariats in 1971 and resolution 44/6, of \r\n1989, the Council of Europe has continued to contribute \r\nto the protection of human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms. Moreover, the Council of Europe has striven \r\nto improve the synergy between its work and that of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe draft resolution before us contains an \r\noperational paragraph on questions relating to \r\nhuman rights. In the informal consultations, several \r\ndelegations called for an end to the use of the death \r\npenalty. Unfortunately, we note with regret that that \r\ncall has once again not been taken on board and that \r\nthe paragraph on that issue was not retained. The new \r\ninclusion of a call for the prevention of torture and other \r\ncruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment \r\nis but a small improvement. The Council of Europe, \r\ntogether with the European Union, its member States \r\nand many other European and non-European countries, \r\nhave been engaged in the campaign on that subject for \r\na long time.\r\nOn the occasion of the World Day against the Death \r\nPenalty on 10 October, the Council of Europe and the \r\nEuropean Union made a joint declaration appealing for \r\na global moratorium on the use of the death penalty \r\nand urging States Members of the United Nations  to \r\nsupport the draft resolution on a moratorium on the \r\nuse of the death penalty when it is put to a General \r\nAssembly vote in December. We hope to build on the \r\nmomentum created by the call for a global moratorium \r\nby all participating members of the sixth World \r\nCongress against the Death Penalty in June of this year. \r\nWe therefore strongly urge that, in future, that issue be \r\nincluded in the draft resolution on cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe.\r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 13/33\r\nFurthermore, we would like to draw representatives’ \r\nattention to the platform to promote the protection \r\nof journalism and the safety of journalists. That new \r\ninstrument was set up by the Council of Europe in 2015 \r\nand has been well accepted as a useful tool by persons \r\nworking for various media in Europe.\r\nMr. Suriboonya (Thailand): Partnership is \r\nindispensable for addressing the myriad global \r\nchallenges. The cooperation between the United \r\nNations and other international organizations is at \r\nthe heart of such international partnerships. Various \r\norganizations contribute to that collective effort \r\nthrough their respective strengths and comparative \r\nadvantages. Thailand recognizes their valuable \r\ncontributions in addressing such challenges. This \r\nyear, my delegation would like to focus our statement \r\nspecifically on the cooperation between the United \r\nNations and INTERPOL.\r\nFirst, Thailand is proud to have been one of the core \r\ngroup members and sponsors of the draft resolution \r\non the cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nINTERPOL (A/71/L.17). Undoubtedly, we have all \r\ngathered here for the same reason, namely, to eradicate \r\nall kinds of threats from our society, no matter which \r\nregion those threats find themselves in, and lead the \r\npeople of the world towards ultimate and sustainable \r\npeace. The critical threats that are now undermining our \r\nwell-being, destroying our economies, jeopardizing our \r\ndemocracy, human rights and human dignity, impairing \r\nthe potential of our generation as well as hindering our \r\nefforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\ncomprise terrorism, transnational crime and, last but \r\nnot least, cybercrime.\r\nEveryone here knows very well how hard the United \r\nNations has continuously fought the aforementioned \r\nthreats. That effort has significantly intensified \r\nsince the beginning of the twenty-first century, or, \r\nmore specifically, since we adopted the Convention \r\non Transnational Organized Crime in 2000. Despite \r\nthe hard work and efforts of the United Nations and \r\nits machinery, especially the United Nations Office \r\non Drugs and Crime, those threats — and I believe \r\nall would agree — have not only increased but have \r\nalso rapidly expanded to every corner of the world. \r\nEven more so, they have become more complex and \r\nsophisticated, and that has made it very difficult for \r\nlaw-enforcement agencies to conduct investigations \r\nand bring the perpetrators to justice.\r\nPhysical connectivity has led to a new paradigm \r\nin travelling in which people can go around the globe \r\nby multiple means of transportation. Wireless and \r\ncyberconnectivity have also enhanced the capabilities \r\nof transnational crime and its networks. Such \r\ntechnological advances can also enable an individual, \r\neven without an organized criminal network, to wreak \r\nhavoc around the world.\r\nIn such a situation, we need intelligence-led \r\npolicing and law enforcement. That means that it is \r\nno longer enough for intelligence to come only from \r\nsecurity agencies. Police and law-enforcement agencies \r\nand the public sector alone cannot fight effectively \r\nagainst crime and terrorism without the participation \r\nof the private sector and, most importantly, that of \r\npeople in the community. In short, we need a public-\r\nprivate-people partnership to fight crime in this \r\ncentury, often called the century of transnational crime \r\nand terrorism.\r\nIn order to engage the people in the fight against \r\ncrime, we need to raise awareness. The United Nations, \r\nthrough the convening of international conferences and \r\nthe adoption of the appropriate resolutions, has the power \r\nto raise public awareness. However, the challenge lies \r\nin how to make the work of the United Nations trickle \r\ndown to the people and be relevant for the frontline \r\nofficers in the performance of their daily duties. We \r\nshould therefore bring the United Nations closer to the \r\npeople. It is time for us to tell the frontline officers that \r\nthe United Nations is relevant for them. It is also time \r\nthat the discussions and exchanges at meetings like this \r\none be made known not only to leaders and politicians, \r\nbut also directly and effectively to frontline officers as \r\nwell as to the people in the community.\r\nINTERPOL’s communication system, also known \r\nas the I-24/7, which has already expanded to frontline \r\nofficers in some countries and is being expanded \r\nin many others, will be the key to raising awareness \r\namong the people and connecting the United Nations to \r\nfrontline officers. With databases that frontline officers \r\ncan immediately access, international best practices \r\nand guidelines, as well as valuable information, can be \r\nmade readily available to them.\r\nPlease allow me to cite an example in my country. \r\nMore than 40 million foreigners came to Thailand \r\nbetween June 2015 and August 2016. Their information, \r\nand their passport numbers in particular, were checked \r\nagainst INTERPOL databases, in particular the Stolen \r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n14/33 16-39494\r\nand Lost Travelling Documents database. Nearly \r\n1,300 foreigners were found to be using lost and stolen \r\npassports. We provided that information to our frontline \r\nofficers around the country, which resulted in 55 \r\nfugitives with INTERPOL red notices being arrested, \r\nthe highest number of arrests in Asia.\r\nThailand believes that a public-private-people-\r\npartnership will lead to effective and smart \r\nintelligence-led policing, which means better and \r\nmore accurate anti-criminal and counter-terrorism \r\noperations. Strengthening the cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and INTERPOL will no doubt \r\ncontribute to that objective, as well as to sustainable \r\npeace. Once again, it is time that we connect the United \r\nNations with the frontline officers and our people. It is \r\ntime for the people to see and understand the impact \r\nof the United Nations work on countering transnational \r\ncrime and terrorism. It is time for people to realize that \r\nthey are part of the solution and to engage themselves \r\nin the fight against transnational threats.\r\nINTERPOL is a key partner for Member States \r\nand the United Nations in making that happen. This \r\nyear’s adoption of the first General Assembly draft \r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand INTERPOL is a remarkable step in that direction.\r\nMr. Rao (India): I wish to refer to the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/71/160) on agenda item 126, on \r\ncooperation between the United Nations and the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO), \r\nand thank him for it. \r\nThe Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization \r\nwas established in 1956. Its inception was a tangible \r\noutcome of the historic Afro-Asian Conference in \r\nBandung, Indonesia, in 1955. AALCO is now composed \r\nof 47 member States from Africa and Asia, with several \r\nStates from other parts of the world participating in \r\nits activities as observer States. AALCO is the only \r\ninterregional organization combining the interests of \r\ntwo major continents for focused and serious discussions \r\non matters of international law. It was one of the first \r\norganizations to which the General Assembly granted \r\npermanent observer status, in 1980. Pursuant to its \r\nmain objective, which is to promote and disseminate \r\ninternational law, AALCO closely follows the work \r\nof the Sixth Committee — the Legal Committee \r\nof the General Assembly — the International Law \r\nCommission and the United Nations Commission on \r\nInternational Trade Law (UNCITRAL).\r\nAs to the contribution of AALCO to the discipline \r\nof international law, a noteworthy development \r\nis the concept of the exclusive economic zone, an \r\nimportant element in the field of the law of the sea. \r\nSimilarly, the organization’s member States use the \r\nBangkok Principles on the status and treatment of \r\nrefugees, adopted by AALCO, for guidance on those \r\nissues. AALCO’s work, which is of great value to its \r\nmember States, includes studies and deliberations, \r\ninter alia, on the principles related to the extradition \r\nof fugitive offenders, the model text for bilateral \r\narrangements on mutual assistance in civil matters and \r\nthe model agreement for the promotion and protection \r\nof investments.\r\nIndia is proud to have been the host country for the \r\norganization since it was established, having provided \r\nland and a building for its headquarters in New Delhi. \r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that the current \r\nAALCO Secretary-General is from Tanzania. Regional \r\nrotation in leadership is a healthy practice, as it draws \r\non the values and enrichment provided by diverse \r\ncultures and perspectives. In May, in New Delhi, \r\nAALCO held its fifty-fifth session, at which such topics \r\nas counter-terrorism, customary international law, \r\nsustainable development, the law of the sea, climate \r\nchange and cybercrime were considered. The results of \r\nits deliberations have been published. AALCO has also \r\nestablished several regional arbitration centres in Asia \r\nand Africa. These centres apply the arbitration rules \r\npromulgated by UNCITRAL, and these arbitrations \r\nhave been well received.\r\nAt United Nations Headquarters, the Permanent \r\nObserver of AALCO has regularly organized seminars, \r\nworkshops and informal discussions on international \r\nlaw topics of common interest. These events are open \r\nto all missions, delegations and the Secretariat, with \r\ninclusive and open discussion as the objective. Judges, \r\njurists, scholars and practitioners visiting New York are \r\ninvited to take an active part in these activities.\r\nMs. Ng Boon Yian (Singapore): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to extend our appreciation to the President of \r\nthe General Assembly for convening today’s important \r\ndebate. We also thank the Secretary-General for his \r\ncomprehensive report on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations \r\n(A/71/160).\r\nI would like to begin with an obvious proposition. \r\nThe United Nations cannot work alone. Regional and \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 15/33\r\nother organizations must be engaged to complement \r\nand support the work of the United Nations and uphold \r\nthe purposes and principles of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Many global challenges that we face today, \r\nfrom climate change to terrorism, are complex and of \r\na transnational nature. A close partnership between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations is \r\nnecessary to address such challenges effectively. \r\nRegional organizations are able to work in concert \r\nwith the United Nations to develop customized \r\nstrategies to implement our collective goals, such as \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change, and to do so in \r\nways that take into account their unique circumstances \r\nand needs. International organizations, on the other \r\nhand, with their functional expertise can be tapped to \r\nenhance our capabilities to achieve our collective goals. \r\nIn that regard, Singapore welcomes the adoption of the \r\nvarious draft resolutions on cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and regional and other organizations \r\ntoday. The significant number of resolutions to be \r\nadopted this year attests to the broad network of \r\npartnerships that the United Nations has forged. This \r\nnetwork should be deepened and broadened.\r\nOf note, Singapore strongly supports the adoption \r\nof a new draft resolution entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the International Criminal Police \r\nOrganization” (A/71/L.17), which we have the honour \r\nof co-sponsoring. The adoption of the draft resolution \r\nis timely and relevant. The threat of transnational \r\ncrime has increased, as criminal networks exploit \r\ntechnological advances and connectivity to further \r\nillicit activities that have grown in sophistication. For \r\nexample, cybercrime is becoming more prevalent and \r\npervasive. We have also witnessed an increasingly \r\nstrong nexus between organized crime and terrorism, \r\nas terrorists resort to criminal activities to finance, \r\nplan and carry out their nefarious activities. Tackling \r\nthese fast-evolving threats therefore requires much \r\nstronger cooperation among Member States and with \r\nkey partners, such as INTERPOL.\r\nWith its long history, INTERPOL has played a \r\nkey role as the world’s largest international police \r\norganization. Singapore has been a proud member of \r\nINTERPOL since 1968 and is privileged to be able to \r\nplay our part to support international law enforcement by \r\nhosting the INTERPOL Global Complex for Innovation. \r\nThe Global Complex in Singapore aims to equip police \r\nall around the world with the tools and capability to \r\nconfront increasingly sophisticated crime. The Global \r\nComplex focuses on digital security, including how \r\nto strengthen cybersecurity and counter cybercrime, \r\nproviding capacity-building and operational and \r\ninvestigative support. Situated in the heart of Asia, \r\nthe Global Complex has broadened partnerships \r\nbetween INTERPOL and relevant stakeholders in \r\nAsia. Singapore looks forward to working closely with \r\nINTERPOL and the United Nations to explore ways to \r\nenhance cooperation through the Global Complex.\r\nAs a member of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), Singapore also looks forward \r\nto the adoption of a draft resolution on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and ASEAN later this \r\nyear. It is encouraging that cooperation between the \r\nUnited Nations and ASEAN has continued to grow \r\nand strengthen over the years. The new five-year Plan \r\nof Action (2016-2020) that we recently adopted to \r\nimplement the Joint Declaration on Comprehensive \r\nPartnership between ASEAN and the United Nations \r\nwill be a useful road map for our collaboration in the \r\nyears ahead. An area that both sides should focus on is \r\nhow to enhance complementarities between the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the ASEAN \r\nCommunity Vision 2025. As ASEAN continues to press \r\nahead with its regional integration efforts, we are eager \r\nto deepen our partnership with the United Nations to \r\nfurther the goals of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand create a better and safer world for our citizens.\r\nMs. Bahous (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to welcome presence here today \r\nof the Secretary General of INTERPOL, Mr. Jürgen \r\nStock, on this important occasion.\r\nMy country, Jordan, is honoured to be among the \r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/71/L.17, on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and INTERPOL. We \r\ntruly believe in the importance and effective role of \r\nINTERPOL in achieving cooperation among law-\r\nenforcement agencies in different countries to make our \r\nworld safer and more secure. We would like to thank \r\nall the Member States that participated in informal \r\ndiscussions on the draft resolution last month. Their \r\nsuggestions and other contributions are reflected in the \r\ndraft resolution we have before us today.\r\nThe draft resolution confirms INTERPOL’s \r\nneutral, non-politicized role, which was designed to \r\nrespect the sovereignty and national legislation of States \r\nin combating organized crime, transnational crime, \r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n16/33 16-39494\r\nhuman trafficking, drug trafficking, the destruction of \r\ncultural heritage, trafficking in cultural property, the \r\nillicit trade in small arms and biological, chemical and \r\nradiological materials, money laundering and crimes \r\nthat affect the environment and wildlife. The draft \r\nresolution also points out the important cooperation \r\nbetween INTERPOL and United Nations agencies in \r\ncombating terrorism by assisting States Members of \r\nthe United Nations in implementing the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy whenever they \r\nrequest such assistance, including information-sharing \r\non foreign terrorist fighters and border control.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to point out that \r\nJordan, through its participation in efforts to enhance \r\ncooperation in combating trafficking in nuclear, \r\nbiological, chemical and radiological materials, has \r\nunderscored IN many forums how important it is to \r\nexchange information to combat threats in that regard. \r\nWe have also emphasized the importance of enhancing \r\ncooperation between INTERPOL, the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency and law-enforcement agencies.\r\nWe encourage countries to benefit from INTERPOL \r\ndatabases, especially the I-24/7 global police \r\ncommunications system, which allows authorized \r\nlaw-enforcement agencies to share sensitive and \r\nimportant information with their counterparts in \r\nMember States around the world. Last week, under the \r\nI-24/7 programme, the Public Security Directorate in \r\nJordan and INTERPOL installed new border-control \r\nequipment, using funding from the European Union. \r\nThe project will be launched in the next few days. \r\nStates can also benefit from the Criminal Information \r\nSystem, which supports the efforts of national agencies \r\nin their investigations and operations. We encourage \r\ncountries that have not yet joined INTERPOL to do so \r\nas soon as possible in order to benefit from the services \r\nand information provided by INTERPOL to all of its \r\nmembers free of charge.\r\nAt a time when the world is suffering from the \r\nscourge of terrorism, THE swift and effective exchange \r\nof information among countries and their security \r\nagencies remains one of the most important means to \r\novercome this phenomenon and reduce its impact and \r\nthat of accompanying organized and transnational \r\ncrimes. As States Members of the United Nations, \r\nwe must therefore establish or enhance platforms \r\nthat allow us to fully carry out this role. Enhancing \r\ncomplementarity among States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations and INTERPOL, as an international \r\norganization, has proved to be highly effective in \r\nlinking law enforcement agencies around the world. As \r\ncountries seeking to create a better and more secure \r\nworld, we now see that cooperation is our duty.\r\nWe would like to stress the importance of \r\nachieving complementarity and cooperation between \r\nsuch specialized agencies as INTERPOL and the \r\nUnited Nations in order to combat organized crime and \r\nterrorist organizations, for such entities are impeding \r\nsustainable development and social development in \r\nmany countries, especially those in the Middle East. The \r\nmost important pillar to stress in the draft resolution is \r\ncomplementarity, the fulfilment of which will contribute \r\nto achieving the Sustainable Development Goals and \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nMr. Sánchez Gil (Spain) (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nwould like to begin by expressing Spain’s support for the \r\nadoption of draft resolution A/71/L.17, on cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and INTERPOL, as well \r\nas to thank Australia and Rwanda for their work \r\nas facilitators.\r\nWe have before us a draft resolution that will \r\nhelp to raise the level of cooperation between both \r\norganizations, even though it has been at a high level \r\nsince it was formalized almost two decades ago. My \r\ncountry, Spain, is aware of the importance of the draft \r\nresolution for exploiting the great potential of the \r\ncoordinated work of both organizations to adequately \r\naddress the fight against terrorism and organized \r\ncrime. For that reason, it is also crucial to efficiently \r\nuse the capabilities that INTERPOL makes available to \r\nits member countries to address security threats.\r\nI would like to conclude by noting Spain’s \r\nsponsorship of the draft resolution, of whose importance \r\nand value we are, above all, convinced.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\nthe pleasure to speak on agenda item 126, in particular \r\non the cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nINTERPOL.\r\nIn that regard, Argentina expresses its satisfaction \r\nat the imminent adoption of the first draft resolution \r\n(A/71/L.17) of the General Assembly on that topic. As a \r\nmember of the Group of Friends of INTERPOL, we had \r\nthe honour of participating actively in the negotiations \r\non it. We thank the facilitators, Australia and Rwanda, \r\nfor the work they have carried out.\r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 17/33\r\nThe text to be adopted today acknowledges and calls \r\nfor reinforced cooperation on a wide range of issues, \r\nsuch as the fight against terrorism and international \r\norganized crime, including, inter alia, the smuggling \r\nof migrants, human trafficking, drug trafficking, the \r\ndestruction of cultural heritage, trafficking in cultural \r\nproperty, piracy, illicit trade in small arms and light \r\nweapons, illicit trafficking in nuclear, biological, \r\nchemical and radiological material, cybercrime, \r\ncorruption, money laundering and crimes that affect \r\nthe environment.\r\nWe underscore the fact that the draft resolution \r\nis fully in line with resolution 70/291, on the United \r\nNations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy review, \r\nco-facilitated by my country and Iceland, whose \r\nparagraph 47 notes with appreciation the activities \r\nundertaken by INTERPOL to help Member States \r\nthat require assistance put the Strategy into practice. \r\nMoreover, we believe that it is a balanced text and the \r\nfruit of arduous negotiations, which afforded Member \r\nStates an opportunity to present and reconcile their \r\npositions. The draft resolution is also a good basis on \r\nwhich we can continue to build on over the next two \r\nyears, particularly following the submission of what \r\nwill be the first report of the Secretary-General on the \r\nsubject, during the seventy-first session.\r\nArgentina expresses its intention to continue \r\ncooperating with INTERPOL, both through the United \r\nNations and at the bilateral level, using the tools \r\nthat INTERPOL makes available to Member States. \r\nSuch cooperation includes the full support of the \r\nregional office in Buenos Aires, which was recently \r\nreflected in the INTERPOL General Assembly with \r\nthe appointment of the Head of the Argentine Federal \r\nPolice, General Commissioner Néstor Roncaglia, as one \r\nof the two representatives of the American continent of \r\nits Executive Committee for the period 2016-2017, as \r\nwell as with the appointment of Ambassador Leandro \r\nDespouy, a human rights law expert, as a member of \r\nthe Commission for the Control of INTERPOL’s Files.\r\nIn the light of those considerations, my delegation \r\nhopes that the General Assembly will adopt draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.17 by consensus.\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nSwitzerland welcomes the imminent adoption of \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.17, which will lead to a \r\ncloser cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nINTERPOL in combating transnational crime and \r\nother security challenges.\r\nIn today’s armed conflicts, it is becoming \r\nincreasingly difficult to distinguish one category of \r\nactors from another. Terrorist groups, for example, rely \r\non criminal methods to appropriate financial resources. \r\nSome of those involved in organized crime are also \r\ninvolved in conflicts of a political nature. Moreover, new \r\nissues, such as the intentional and illegal destruction \r\nof cultural heritage, cybercrime and the involvement \r\nof foreign terrorist fighters, have an overall impact on \r\nsecurity and stability at both the national and global \r\nlevels. Such threats concern all States.\r\nStrengthening cooperation and coordination between \r\nthe United Nations and INTERPOL will serve the \r\ngoals and purposes of both organizations. That will \r\nbe achieved by taking advantage of existing synergies \r\nwhenever the opportunity arises. Using the resulting \r\nresources more effectively will contribute to long-term \r\nsecurity improvements.\r\nAs a founding member of INTERPOL, Switzerland \r\nhas always played an active role in the development of \r\nthe organization’s activities. Since it became a Member \r\nof the United Nations, our country has committed \r\nto fostering closer cooperation between the two \r\norganizations in order to better confront the challenges \r\nI mentioned. In that regard, we consider the adoption of \r\nthis draft resolution as a decisive step in strengthening \r\nthat cooperation. Furthermore, we also attach great \r\nimportance to the report that will be submitted by \r\nthe Secretary-General to the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-third session, which should allow us to assess \r\nthe progress made.\r\nLastly, I would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe representatives of Australia and Rwanda for their \r\nexcellent work in facilitating the preparation of this draft \r\nresolution. Our thanks also go to the representatives of \r\nthe Office of the Special Representative of INTERPOL \r\nto the United Nations for the valuable technical advice \r\nthey provided throughout the negotiations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with resolution 44/6, of 17 October 1989, I \r\nnow call on the observer of the Council of Europe.\r\nMr. Jagland (Council of Europe): This year, for \r\nthe tenth time, the General Assembly will adopt a draft \r\nresolution (A/71/L.15) on the cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe. The \r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n18/33 16-39494\r\nfirst-ever such resolution, resolution 55/3, adopted in \r\nOctober 2000, contained 11 paragraphs; this year’s \r\ndraft resolution has nearly 30. There have also been \r\nqualitative developments, as we cooperate on many \r\nmore issues today.\r\nThe United Nations is a major partner of the Council \r\nof Europe and an ideal platform for global outreach. \r\nWe work closely with a large number of United Nations \r\nbodies. The universality of our values constitutes the \r\nbasis of our cooperation.\r\nThe relationships between our organizations are \r\nfocused on, but not limited to, human rights in a broad \r\nsense. Emphasis is placed on cooperation with the \r\nHuman Rights Council, in particular in the framework \r\nof the Universal Periodic Review, to which the Council \r\nof Europe contributes regularly and actively with \r\nrespect to its member States. We see broad synergy \r\nbetween the development of the jurisprudence of \r\nthe European Court of Human Rights and the quasi-\r\njurisprudence of the United Nations treaty bodies, \r\nas well as the guidance emanating from special \r\nprocedures mandate-holders and the Universal Periodic \r\nReview. Despite slight differences, the overall direction \r\nof the two organizations’ vectors is the same and \r\nincludes addressing new challenges arising from new \r\ntechnologies, as in, for example, the area of information \r\ntechnology. It also includes challenges that are emerging \r\nowing to changes in our societies, for example, from \r\nthe terrorist threat and the need to respect human rights \r\nwhile tackling terrorism, and a shared reflection on the \r\nincreasing sensitivity of the human rights community \r\nfor the rights of various groups at risk, such as the Roma, \r\npersons with physical and intellectual disabilities or \r\nmigrants in an irregular situation.\r\nAfter those general considerations, let me address \r\nthe particular issue of the death penalty. The Council \r\nof Europe takes great pride in having been the driving \r\nforce in making the European continent a death-\r\npenalty-free zone for more than 800 million people. \r\nTwo treaties have been central in that regard, namely, \r\nProtocol No. 6 to the European Convention on Human \r\nRights, which prohibits the death penalty in times of \r\npeace, and Protocol No. 13, which prohibits it in all \r\ncircumstances. In the last 19 years, no death sentence \r\nhas been carried out on the territories of our 47 member \r\nStates. Let me remind the Assembly that Belarus, the \r\nonly European State that carries out capital punishment, \r\nis not a member of the Council of Europe.\r\nIn 2010, the European Court of Human Rights \r\nqualified the death penalty as inhuman and degrading \r\ntreatment, regardless of the circumstances under \r\nwhich it is imposed or executed. We are proud of these \r\ndevelopments. However, three member States have still \r\nto meet their accession commitments and ratify the \r\ninstruments I mentioned.\r\nAt the global level, we are pleased to note that \r\ntoday 140 countries around the world have abolished \r\nthe death penalty either legislatively or in practice. \r\nIt is a gradual but still committed shift towards the \r\nelimination of capital punishment. On the other hand, \r\nthere has been a spike in executions, albeit in a limited \r\nnumber of countries. There has also been a resumption \r\nof executions in several other countries and an increase \r\nin executions for drug offences, including of minors.\r\nThat is why the Council of Europe will remain \r\nattentive and proactive, and will do so in two general \r\ndirections. The first is with regard to our own member \r\nStates, and the second is at the global level. We think that \r\nthe legal framework adopted by the Council of Europe, \r\nas interpreted by the case law of the European Court of \r\nHuman Rights, makes the abolition of the death penalty \r\nlegally irreversible. However, it is very important to see \r\nhow citizens will adopt and come to share the values \r\non the abolition of the death penalty. Therefore, we \r\nshould invest more in long-term education, especially \r\nof children and young people, and present the case for \r\nabolition as an integral part of the broader political \r\nand social objective of a just, humane and democratic \r\nsociety. The issue is one of fundamental human rights.\r\nAs to the global dimension, in September 2016, \r\nthe Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe \r\ndecided to emphasize its contribution to the biennial \r\ndraft resolution of the General Assembly on a global \r\nmoratorium on the use of the death penalty. We are \r\nalso continuing to work with the European Union in \r\nthat regard. I believe that there is scope to deepen \r\nand expand this cooperation through concerted policy \r\naction that support efforts for a global moratorium and \r\nthrough actions that target particularly unacceptable \r\nforms of capital punishment.\r\nFinally, I thank the delegation of Estonia and \r\nthe other sponsors of draft resolution A/71/PV.15 for \r\npromoting it.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Pursuant \r\nto resolution 51/1, of 5 October 1996, I now give the \r\nf loor to the Secretary General of INTERPOL.\r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 19/33\r\nMr. Stock (International Criminal Police \r\nOrganization): In January 1946, the United Nations, \r\nthen known as the United Nations Organization, held \r\nits first General Assembly in London. Six months later, \r\nINTERPOL, then known as the International Criminal \r\nPolice Commission, held its fifteenth General Assembly \r\nin Brussels. After a difficult period for the world, the \r\nmeeting was called to restore the Commission, which \r\nhad not held any meetings since 1938. Records show \r\nthat even then INTERPOL’s member countries had \r\nreflected on what its relations would be with the United \r\nNations. In the 70 years since then the global threat \r\nlandscape has evolved in many ways. The complexities \r\nin tackling transnational crime are very grave. The \r\ntrends in criminal f lows indicate ever-growing \r\nchallenges over the horizon. In this period, enhancing \r\ncross-border law enforcement cooperation has become \r\ncritical, as has the need for Governmental leadership \r\nworldwide to support such cooperation.\r\nServing as an independent, apolitical entity since \r\n1923, INTERPOL connects law enforcement around \r\nthe globe in working together towards a safer world. \r\nWith neutrality enshrined in its Constitution, our \r\norganization enables cooperation among police forces \r\nof countries that do not even have diplomatic relations. \r\nINTERPOL has well-developed policing capabilities \r\nto assist its global membership, based strictly on its \r\nneutral mandate and objectives. The organization \r\nprovides a unique, trusted and secure platform to enable \r\nthe exchange of police information across borders. This \r\ncontinues to be at the core of INTERPOL’s mandate. In \r\nfact, at the last INTERPOL General Assembly session, \r\nheld only two weeks ago, member countries voted \r\nfor new, additional measures to make INTERPOL’s \r\ninformation-sharing system more robust.\r\nWe also provide capacity-building, analytical \r\nexpertise and 24/7 support to policing and law \r\nenforcement, which includes the coordination of \r\ncross-border operational efforts. Established in \r\nevery single member country, INTERPOL’s national \r\nand central bureaus serve to facilitate international \r\npolice cooperation within an established institutional \r\nframework. INTERPOL has three global programmes \r\nfocusing on countering terrorism, organized and \r\nemerging crimes, and cybercrime. In these spheres of \r\ncriminal activities, cooperation between the United \r\nNations and INTERPOL is key to achieving our \r\ncommon goals.\r\nFinally, as an independent and neutral entity serving \r\nlaw enforcement, INTERPOL must and will remain \r\ncompletely apolitical. However, given the existing \r\ncomplex threat landscape, efforts at international \r\npolice cooperation require more support from the \r\npolitical leadership. In the fight against twenty-first \r\ncentury transnational crime, more emphasis should \r\nbe placed on the responsibility Governments can take \r\nto facilitate the work of law enforcement globally \r\nbecause, looking ahead, continued cooperation on \r\npolice and security matters is increasingly desirable \r\nfor bringing about global peace and stability. I recently \r\nexpressed this view to the outgoing Secretary-General, \r\nunder whose tenure our cooperation has deepened and \r\ngrown stronger. INTERPOL thanks Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his consistent support. We also look \r\nforward to nurturing this relationship further under the \r\nSecretary-General-designate.\r\nHere, today, the introduction of draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.17, entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the International Criminal Police \r\nOrganization”, marks an important step forward in the \r\njourney of our two organizations. With it, we move \r\ncloser to supporting INTERPOL’s vision of a safer \r\nworld for our member countries and for the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to recognize the key role \r\nthat the Permanent Missions of Australia and Rwanda \r\nplayed in facilitating the draft resolution. I would \r\nalso like to extend INTERPOL’s gratitude to the draft \r\nresolution’s sponsors, in particular the Permanent \r\nMissions of Argentina, Brazil, Jamaica, Jordan, \r\nThailand and Switzerland, which greatly assisted in \r\nthis important process.\r\nIn the end, it is in support of the efforts of law- \r\nenforcement agencies in 190 member countries that \r\nwe stand here today to foster synergies for a safer \r\nworld. On their behalf, let me assure the Assembly that \r\ninternational police cooperation must positively look \r\nforward to the ongoing cooperation of INTERPOL with \r\nall relevant agencies in the United Nations system. With \r\nthat hope and purpose in mind, INTERPOL expresses \r\nits gratitude to the General Assembly for giving us this \r\nopportunity today.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with resolution 54/5, of 8 October 1999, I \r\nnow give the f loor to the observer of the Organization \r\nof the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.\r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n20/33 16-39494\r\nMr. Christides (Organization of the Black Sea \r\nEconomic Cooperation): As the representative \r\nof the Permanent International Secretariat of the \r\nOrganization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation.\r\n(BSEC), I am honoured and privileged to address the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the first time in my 40-year \r\ndiplomatic career.\r\nThe BSEC organization is the oldest and most \r\ninstitutionally mature international entity promoting \r\neconomic cooperation, in the broadest sense of the \r\nterm, among its 12 member States and in the wider \r\nBlack Sea region. Next year, we will celebrate our \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary, which will culminate in a \r\nsummit conference to be held in Istanbul on 30 June.\r\nWe have come a long way since 1992. The \r\norganization’s multifaceted activities have decisively \r\ncontributed to enhancing cooperation and better \r\nunderstanding in a geostrategic region of the greatest \r\nimportance. It is a region that even today faces \r\nwelcome challenges, but also problems that sometimes \r\ncast their shadow on BSEC efforts. Yet the added value \r\nour organization provides is that it acts as a functioning \r\nconfidence-building mechanism and is an open window \r\nfor dialogue and understanding.\r\nAt the same time, BSEC remains an open \r\norganization, seeking cooperation and synergies with \r\nother international bodies and with individual States. \r\nOver the years, we have come to highly appreciate \r\nour cooperation with the United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies, funds and programmes in areas \r\nof common interest.\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.16/Rev.1, which has been \r\nintroduced for adoption today, testifies to the increased \r\ninteraction between our organizations and provides \r\nuseful guidelines for our future joint endeavours. Today, \r\none of the BSEC priorities is to increase its efficiency \r\nand effectiveness, enabling it to be more results- and \r\nproject-oriented for the benefit of the peoples of our \r\nregion. In increasing its project-development and \r\nimplementation capacity, BSEC can benefit even more \r\nfrom deepening its interaction with the United Nations \r\nsystem through concrete and focused collaborations.\r\nAllow me therefore from this rostrum to invite the \r\nspecialized agencies, funds and programmes of the \r\nUnited Nations system to strengthen their cooperation \r\nwith the BSEC family of organizations and create new \r\nsynergies based on existing cooperation agreements \r\nand memorandums. The BSEC structure of related \r\nbodies has the knowledge and experience to help \r\nUnited Nations agencies to effectively implement their \r\npolicies and programmes in this crucial region of our \r\nsmall world.\r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to express our sincere \r\ngratitude to the Republic of Serbia for its excellent \r\nguidance and solid support for the activities of the \r\norganization in its capacity as the Chairman-in-Office \r\nof BSEC during the second half of 2016 and for \r\npreparing the draft resolution, which we hope the \r\nAssembly will adopt by consensus. I would also like \r\nto express our appreciation to all BSEC member States \r\nand to the other States Members of the United Nations \r\nthat have sponsored the draft resolution.\r\nAllow me to take this opportunity to congratulate \r\nSecretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his strong \r\nleadership of the United Nations in these most turbulent \r\ntimes in world history and for being the friendly and \r\nhuman face of the United Nations in promoting its work \r\naround the world. We wish him health, happiness and \r\ncontinued success in his future endeavours.\r\nOn behalf of BSEC, I would also like to congratulate \r\nMr. António Guterres on his election to the highly \r\nprestigious and most challenging diplomatic duty of \r\nleading the United Nations. I have no doubt that, with \r\nhis immense experience as the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees, Mr. Guterres will continue \r\nto carry the torch soon to be handed to him by Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon and that he will appeal to the \r\nconscience of the international community in, inter alia, \r\ntrying to bring to an end the worst humanitarian crisis \r\nsince the Second World War, namely, the refugee crisis.\r\nThe BSEC organization will continue to assume its \r\nresponsibilities in contributing to peace, security and \r\nstability in our part of the world through the effective \r\npromotion of economic cooperation among our member \r\nStates and beyond.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with resolution 59/48, of 2 December \r\n2004, I give the f loor to the observer of the Shanghai \r\nCooperation Organization.\r\nMr. Alimov (Shanghai Cooperation Organization) \r\n(spoke in Russian): At the outset, I would like to express \r\nmy gratitude to all participants in today’s General \r\nAssembly meeting for their support for draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.11, entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization”. \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 21/33\r\nWe consider this draft resolution to be part of the \r\ncomprehensive support of the international community \r\nfor our joint efforts to maintain peace and security and \r\nprovide the conditions for sustainable development.\r\nThis year, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization \r\n(SCO) marked its fifteenth anniversary. Since its \r\nfounding, the organization has believed that the United \r\nNations has been, and will continue to be, a leading \r\nuniversal international structure for maintaining global \r\nsecurity and a major platform for solving inter-State and \r\ninternational issues, as it stands for strengthening its \r\ncentral coordinating role in international affairs. In that \r\nregard, we attach particular attention to furthering the \r\nprogressive development of the relationship between \r\nthe Shanghai Cooperation Organization and the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies.\r\nSince 2004, cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization has \r\ngradually developed to the point where it has become \r\na good example of effective cooperation between \r\nuniversal, global and regional organizations. The draft \r\nresolution opens new vistas for a broad spectrum of \r\ncooperation, and it will help to fully implement the \r\nmultifaceted potential of the SCO in its interaction with \r\nUnited Nations agencies.\r\nUnfortunately, we have to acknowledge that the \r\ncontemporary world is not becoming more predictable \r\nor safe. The challenges and threats are increasing \r\nin number, while their essence is becoming more \r\ncomplicated. The draft resolution calls for joining \r\ntogether in cooperation to make efforts in a broad range \r\nof areas. The key ones are mentioned in the programme \r\ndocuments of the two organizations, including the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development and the SCO \r\nDevelopment Strategy until 2025, which are aimed at \r\nsolving similar tasks and promoting the well-being \r\nof humankind.\r\nThe draft resolution will become a sound foundation \r\nfor broad interaction between the United Nations and \r\nthe SCO in all directions. Consolidating and developing \r\neffective connections between the United Nations and \r\nregional organizations not only facilitates development \r\nof the regional structures, but to a great extent \r\nstrengthens the United Nations itself. This fully applies \r\nto the cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nSCO. This topic was discussed during the Security \r\nCouncil thematic debate on cooperation of the United \r\nNations with regional and subregional organizations, \r\nheld on 28 October 2016, at the initiative of the Russian \r\nFederation (see S/PV.7796).\r\nWe are convinced that the increasing synergies \r\nof the multifaceted cooperation between the two \r\norganizations will help to solve the most urgent \r\ncontemporary problems, including maintaining \r\nglobal peace and security and ensuring sustainable \r\ndevelopment. It is important to continue the United \r\nNations efforts to strengthen and broadening such \r\npartnerships, including by elaborating well-directed \r\napproaches to cooperation while fully taking into \r\naccount the needs, local specifics, mandates and \r\ncapacities of regional organizations.\r\nThe SCO is open to all forms of mutually \r\nbeneficial cooperation with the United Nations and is \r\nready to continue its close partnership in doing joint, \r\nfruitful work.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with resolution 477 (V), of 1 November \r\n1950, I now give the f loor to the observer of the League \r\nof Arab States.\r\nMr. Enani (League of Arab States) (spoke in \r\nArabic): First of all, allow me to congratulate the \r\nPresident on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. We are certain \r\nthat, thanks to his experience, we will be successful \r\nin our shared endeavours. The League of Arab States \r\nwishes to express its support for the President as he \r\nstrives to serve the Organization.\r\nI also thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis unstinting efforts to serve the Organization over the \r\npast 10 years. I also wish to congratulate Mr. António \r\nGuterres, the new Secretary-General-designate. We \r\nwish him every success in his work, which will be full \r\nof challenges when he takes up his mandate next year. I \r\nalso thank the Secretary General of INTERPOL.\r\nThe close cooperation between the League of \r\nArab States and the United Nations began in 1950, \r\nwhen the General Assembly requested the United \r\nNations Secretary-General to extend an invitation to \r\nthe Secretary-General of the League of Arab States \r\nto attend the fifth session of the General Assembly as \r\nan observer. That invitation was extended pursuant \r\nto resolution 477 (V), of 1 November 1950. Since \r\nthen cooperation between the two organizations \r\nhas increased.\r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n22/33 16-39494\r\nIn 1981, a new era of cooperation was ushered in with \r\nthe adoption of resolution 36/24, entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the League of Arab \r\nStates”. When the League of Arab States asked the \r\nUnited Nations Secretary-General to take the steps \r\nneeded to bolster cooperation at all levels between the \r\ntwo organizations, the 1981 resolution provided the basis \r\nfor evaluation. The assessment was conducted to extend \r\ncooperation on a vast range of issues. Since that time, \r\ncooperation has been multifaceted in nature in order \r\nto respond to needs as they emerge, fulfil the vision of \r\nthe League of Arab States and meet the political and \r\neconomic challenges facing the Arab world.\r\nIn September 2016, at the margins of the general \r\ndebate of the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession, Mr. Ahmed Aboul Gheit, Secretary-General \r\nof the League of Arab States, and the United Nations \r\nSecretary-General signed a protocol amending the text \r\nof the cooperation agreement. Cooperation between our \r\norganizations will now change and touch upon such areas \r\nas conflict resolution, conflict prevention, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, crime prevention, peacebuilding, the \r\nprotection of human rights, and human development. \r\nIt will also cover issues relating to refugees, displaced \r\npersons and human rights.\r\nWith a view to this increased cooperation between \r\nthe League of Arab States and the United Nations, \r\nin October 2014, the second sectoral cooperation \r\nconference between the two organizations, on the \r\nramifications of a lack of understanding of human \r\nrights concepts, was held at the headquarters of the \r\nLeague of Arab States, in Cairo. Furthermore, in May \r\n2016, in Geneva, the sixteenth cooperation meeting \r\nbetween the two organizations was held in order to \r\nenhance cooperation between the two organizations \r\nso as to develop an overarching vision that would \r\ninclude the review of developments in the Arab world \r\nand take into account the views of experts. During the \r\nconference, we also reviewed the socioeconomic and \r\npolitical concerns of the region. We adopted a series of \r\nprogrammes to be implemented between 2016 and 2018 \r\nin the areas addressed during the meeting.\r\nOur two organizations are strengthening their \r\npartnership in a number of areas. We have built capacity \r\nin elections and human rights as part of a project \r\nthat was launched together with the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme. Other initiatives include the \r\nsetting up of databases and a project among Arab States \r\nto include Arab young people in debates on social \r\nissues. To the latter end, we have held dialogues in \r\nvarious forums in order not to isolate people — young \r\npeople in particular — and to tap into their ideas and \r\nfind alternatives approaches to dealing with climate \r\nchange and other issues, including identity, the role of \r\nyoung people and their participation in resolving these \r\nissues. We have enjoyed fruitful cooperation with the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\nand the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian \r\nAffairs, as well as with the various specialized agencies \r\nof the United Nations, with a view to implementing \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and properly \r\ninvest in young people. We must protect young people \r\nduring armed conflicts, ensure the non-proliferation of \r\nweapons and strengthen human rights. Other activities \r\nin that connection were also debated.\r\nGiven our commitment to properly respecting the \r\n1945 Charter of the League of Arab States, and in the \r\nlight of the importance that we attach to the United \r\nNations, its various agencies and what those do to \r\nprotect refugees, we must leave no stone unturned in \r\nfinding a fair solution to the refugee crisis. We are \r\nindeed doing everything we can in that connection. We \r\nalso reaffirm the importance of the appeal launched \r\nby the Ministerial Council of the League of Arab \r\nStates, and we urge the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast (UNRWA) and its donor countries to respond to \r\nthat appeal. Vast sums of money need to be collected \r\nto support those refugees. In November, a high-level \r\nmeeting on a common strategy was convened to benefit \r\nPalestinian children at the headquarters of the League \r\nof Arab States, which brought together representatives \r\nof UNRWA who work with Palestinian children.\r\nFrustration reigns in the Middle East. That climate \r\nserves to demonstrate the vast number of challenges \r\nwe face. There is currently a great deal of turbulence \r\nin our region. The political climate is difficult and the \r\ninternational community has not been able to respond to \r\nour appeals to combat terrorism and violent extremism. \r\nIn order to continue the efforts undertaken by the League \r\nof Arab States to meet all of the challenges we face \r\nin the Arab world — terrorism in Yemen, Syria, Iraq \r\nand Libya — and to implement and uphold the vision of \r\nthe League of Arab States, namely, finding a peaceful \r\nsolution to all Arab conflicts, the Secretary General of \r\nthe League of Arab States appointed a Special Envoy on \r\nthe issue of Libya in order to take stock of developments \r\nin Libya, together with the African Union. Ending the \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 23/33\r\ncrisis in Libya is the ultimate aim, as well as tackling \r\nthe scourge of terrorism in the country.\r\nThe League of Arab States has now faced the \r\ngrowing threat of terrorism for more than five years. \r\nIndeed, the use of social networks to indoctrinate \r\nyoung people has seen a six-fold increase. Extremists’ \r\nobscurantist ideologies and hate speech are disseminated \r\nthrough social networks in order to sow the seeds of \r\nan ideology that in no way fits hand in glove with \r\npeace-loving religions and indeed has nothing at all to \r\ndo with any religion.\r\nDuring its meetings with the Security Council, the \r\nLeague of Arab States has therefore underscored the \r\nimportance of implementing the measures necessary to \r\nstymie that hate speech, so as to remedy the problems \r\nof terrorism and the indoctrination of foreign fighters \r\nthrough social networks. Terrorist organizations and \r\ntheir affiliates cannot sow the seeds of those extremist \r\nideologies using social networks and must not do so; \r\nthey must be stopped. They must also be stopped from \r\nusing the media to pursue similar aims, as the Internet \r\nand the media are also used for those activities The \r\nuse of any medium to disseminate hate speech must \r\nbe outlawed.\r\nWhat I have laid out here gives the General \r\nAssembly an overview of our activities to further \r\ncooperation between the League of Arab States and \r\nthe United Nations. There are programmes under way \r\nin various political, cultural and legal spheres. To \r\nconclude, I wish to thank all Member States that have \r\nsupported draft resolution A/71/L.6. I also wish to thank \r\nthe representative of Algeria for introducing it. I call \r\nupon the General Assembly to adopt it by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): In \r\naccordance with resolution 35/2, of 13 October 1980, \r\nI now give the f loor to the Observer for the Asian-\r\nAfrican Legal Consultative Organization.\r\nMr. Lee (Asian-African Legal Consultative \r\nOrganization): I would like to refer to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s report (A/71/160) submitted under agenda \r\nitem 126, in particular as it pertains to the cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Asian-African \r\nLegal Consultative Organization (AALCO).\r\nThe Asian-African Legal Consultative Organization \r\nincludes 47 member States, as well as several observer \r\nStates from other regions of the world. It was one of \r\nthe first interregional organizations specialized in \r\ninternational law to be granted observer status by the \r\nGeneral Assembly. That step by the Assembly was in \r\npart in recognition of its contribution to the concepts \r\nof the exclusive economic zone, archipelago States \r\nand the continental shelf, which took place during the \r\nnegotiations of the third United Nations Conference on \r\nthe Law of the Sea in the 1970s.\r\nAALCO now has a new Secretary-General, \r\nProfessor Kennedy Gastorn of Tanzania, which follows \r\non from the organization’s healthy tradition of rotating \r\nits management leadership. One of the main purposes \r\nof AALCO is to promote and disseminate public \r\ninternational law. That is why AALCO works very \r\nclosely with principal legal bodies, such as the Sixth \r\nCommittee, the International Law Commission and the \r\nUnited Nations Commission on International Trade Law \r\n(UNCITRAL). Much of the subject matter considered \r\nby those core legal bodies is also considered and \r\nstudied by AALCO. Such topics include, for example, \r\nthe law of the sea, counter-terrorism, sustainable \r\ndevelopment, climate change and cybercrime. Results \r\nof the deliberations are published and are available on \r\nthe organization’s website. In that context, AALCO \r\nwould like to thank in particular the Secretary-General \r\nand his Office and the Office of Legal Affairs for their \r\nsupport and cooperation.\r\nAALCO also has several regional arbitration \r\ncentres and uses the arbitration rules promulgated \r\nby UNCITRAL. The results of the arbitration are \r\nwell received and form a firm basis for the conduct \r\nof trade in the relevant regions. At United Nations \r\nHeadquarters, the Permanent Observer organizes \r\nseminars, workshops and informal consultations on \r\ntopics of international law of common interest on a \r\nregular basis with zero budget. Those events are open to \r\nall missions, delegations and the Secretariat; inclusive \r\nand open discussions are the objective. Judges, jurists, \r\nscholars and practitioners visiting New York are invited \r\nto actively take part in those activities. AALCO serves \r\nas a forum for intellectual stimulation and the free \r\nexchange of views.\r\nThe General Assembly has initiated many \r\nsignificant activities, including the setting up of a \r\nnew management mechanism for marine diversity and \r\ngenetic resources. As it has done before, AALCO is \r\nready to assist in building a functional, competitive \r\nand sustainable legal regime for managing such \r\nresources in the international ocean area beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction.\r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n24/33 16-39494\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on agenda item 126 \r\nand its sub-items (a) to (z). We will now consider draft \r\nresolutions A/71/L.5, A/71/L.6, A/71/L.7, A/71/L.9, \r\nA/71/L.11, A/71/L.12, A/71/L.14, A/71/L.15, A/71/L.16/\r\nRev.1 and A/71/L.17.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to speakers for explanations \r\nof vote or position before we take decisions on the draft \r\nresolutions, may I remind delegations that explanations \r\nare limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMrs. Kanchaveli (Georgia): I take the f loor to \r\nexpress my delegation’s position on draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.5, entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Commonwealth of Independent \r\nStates” (CIS), and draft resolution A/71/L.7, entitled \r\n“Cooperation between the United Nations and the \r\nCollective Security Treaty Organization” (CSTO).\r\nIn the text of the draft resolution on the CSTO, the \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\n“[n]otes with appreciation the significant \r\npractical contribution and efforts of the Collective \r\nSecurity Treaty Organization to strengthen its \r\npeacekeeping capacities and the system of regional \r\nsecurity and stability” (A/71/L.7, para. 2);\r\nwhile the draft resolution on the CIS suggests that\r\n“strengthening cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Commonwealth of Independent \r\nStates will advance the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations” (A/71/L.5, seventh \r\npreambular paragraph).\r\nIn that regard, Georgia wishes to recall the \r\nongoing illegal occupation of the Georgian regions \r\nof Abkhazia and Tskhinvali Region/South Ossetia by \r\nthe Russian Federation, which is a member of both \r\nthe CIS and the CSTO, the continuous militarization \r\nof those regions and the policy of factual annexation, \r\nconducted in breach of international law, including \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, as well as the \r\nmisuse of the mandate of the CIS peacekeeping mission \r\nboth in Abkhazia and the Tskhinvali Region/South \r\nOssetia over the years. Therefore, my delegation cannot \r\nendorse the draft resolutions mentioned and would like \r\nto disassociate itself from the consensus. We request \r\nthat the Secretariat reflect this statement in the records \r\nof this plenary meeting for both draft resolutions.\r\nMr. Lupan (Republic of Moldova): I will speak \r\nabout draft resolution A/71/L.5, entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States” (CIS).\r\nThe Republic of Moldova supports the promotion \r\nof cooperation between the United Nations and regional \r\norganizations in advancing the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. We believe that \r\nregional organizations play an essential role in fostering \r\npartnerships with a view to addressing economic and \r\ndevelopment issues, in a more targeted and cooperative \r\nway, among countries sharing common borders or \r\neconomic interests. The Republic of Moldova will \r\ncontinue to promote and support initiatives aimed at \r\nthe modernization of economies in the Commonwealth \r\nof Independent States region, in the development \r\nof transport infrastructure, the free movement of \r\npeople and cooperation in the area of anti-terrorism. \r\nWe also expect the complete and non-discriminatory \r\nimplementation of the free trade agreement within \r\nthe Commonwealth of Independent States, signed in \r\nOctober 2011.\r\nAs stated at the summit of CIS leaders held in \r\nBishkek in September, the Republic of Moldova is \r\nstrongly interested in, and calls for, the elimination \r\nof all barriers to commercial activities for the benefit \r\nof all participating countries in this regional forum, \r\nas well as for meaningful inter-State cooperation in \r\nthe humanitarian, cultural and social fields. With \r\nregard to the agenda item discussed today, we took \r\nnote of the activities outlined in the report (A/71/160) \r\nof the Secretary-General regarding cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the CIS and which \r\nprovides information about the various exchanges and \r\ncontacts with the CIS secretariat in matters relating \r\nto anti-terrorism measures, statistics and the cross-\r\nboundary effects of industrial activities.\r\nWhile joining the consensus on the draft resolution \r\nregarding the cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Commonwealth of Independent States, we wish \r\nto reiterate the fact that, because of its reservations \r\nabout the regulations on the chairmanship of the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, adopted on \r\n10 October 2008, the Republic of Moldova does not \r\nrecognize the international legal personality of the CIS \r\nand its relations with other international organizations. \r\nTherefore, the adoption of this draft resolution shall not \r\nbe interpreted as a deviation from those reservations. I \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 25/33\r\nwould appreciate having this clarification reflected in \r\nthe records of this meeting.\r\nMr. Al Arsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): My country, the Syrian Arab Republic, \r\nbelieves that dangerous and undemocratic practices \r\nare marring the working methods in the League of \r\nArab States as a result of the illegal and illegitimate \r\npolicies and attitudes adopted by the Governments \r\nof certain States members of that organization with a \r\nview to controlling the election and decision-making \r\nmechanisms and the working methods of that regional \r\norganization. The League of Arab States has therefore \r\ngone beyond its goals to respect the independence and \r\nsovereignty of States, to safeguard the principle of \r\nnon-interference in their internal affairs, to pursue the \r\nmaintenance of regional and international peace and \r\nsecurity and to defend the interests of peoples, and is \r\ninstead exerting economic and humanitarian pressure \r\non them. For all those reasons, the delegation of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic would like to request that draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.6 be put to a vote.\r\nMy country also believes that malpractice is \r\nmarring the working methods of the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation (OIC) owing to the attempts by the \r\nGovernments of certain States to f lagrantly interfere \r\nin its election and decision-making mechanisms and \r\nthe working methods of that organization as well. That \r\nhas made the OIC face risks that jeopardize some of its \r\ndeclared goals when it comes to justice and equality \r\nbetween member States with regard to respecting \r\nthe independence and sovereignty of States and the \r\nprinciple of non-interference in their internal affairs. \r\nFor all of those reasons, the delegation of the Syrian \r\nArab Republic would like as well for the draft resolution \r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation” to be put to \r\na vote.\r\nMr. Yelchencko (Ukraine): Before the General \r\nAssembly proceeds to the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.5, entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Commonwealth of Independent States” \r\n(CIS), I would like to make the following statement.\r\nIn general, Ukraine supports cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and regional and other organizations \r\nwith regard to Chapter VIII of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. We consider such cooperation to be \r\nan important condition for the effective settlement \r\nof conflicts and the promotion of peace and security. \r\nUnfortunately, that is not the case with the CIS. To \r\nour disappointment, that organization demonstrated \r\nits complete failure to take appropriate measures to \r\nrespond to the Russian aggression in Ukraine. The CIS \r\nis still pretending that there is no Russian aggression, \r\nno illegal occupation of Crimea and no war crimes \r\ncommitted by the Russian Federation. At the same \r\ntime, I would like to make a short clarification.\r\nI am speaking about the CIS as an organization. \r\nWe are very grateful to some of its members for their \r\nnon-recognition of the attempted annexation of Crimea. \r\nTheir voices are important in our common efforts aimed \r\nat defending the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nI would also like to remind the General Assembly \r\nthat Ukraine has not signed the decision of the Council \r\nof Heads of State of the CIS of 24 December 1993, \r\nconcerning certain measures to ensure international \r\nrecognition of the CIS with regard to granting observer \r\nstatus for the CIS at the General Assembly. In not \r\ndoing so, Ukraine acted on the basis of the statement \r\ndelivered on 20 December 1991 of the Parliament of \r\nUkraine concerning the conclusion of the agreement \r\non the CIS, which stated that Ukraine declined to \r\ngrant the Commonwealth the status of a subject of \r\ninternational law.\r\nThe delegation of Ukraine must also draw attention \r\nto the fact that the basic documents of the CIS — namely, \r\nthe Agreement on the Establishment of the CIS, the \r\nAlma Ata Declaration and the CIS Charter — do not \r\nqualify the status of the Commonwealth as one with \r\nthe features of a subject of international law. The CIS \r\nis a special international, interregional formation that \r\nnot only lacks definite status, but actually includes a \r\nmilitary and political alliance established on the basis \r\nof the Tashkent agreement on collective security of \r\n15 May 1992, which binds only some members of the \r\nCommonwealth.\r\nMy delegation would also like to draw the attention \r\nof the Assembly to the fact that some provisions of the \r\ndraft resolution do not correspond in full to the realities \r\non the ground. In particular, paragraph 1 of document \r\nA/71/L.5 notes that\r\n“the activities of the Commonwealth of Independent \r\nStates to strengthen regional cooperation in such \r\nareas as trade and economic development”,\r\nwhile the Russian Federation has undertaken targeted \r\nillegal and discriminatory steps on trade with Ukraine. \r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n26/33 16-39494\r\nWith respect to Ukraine, it unilaterally suspended the \r\nFree Trade Area Treaty of 18 October 2011 — concluded \r\nwithin the CIS — as well as introduced prohibitions \r\nand restrictions on imports of Ukrainian agricultural \r\nproducts, raw materials and food supplies, prohibitions \r\nand limitations on freedom of transit of international \r\ncargo transit from Ukraine through the territory of the \r\nRussian Federation to the territories of the Republic of \r\nKazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic. The prohibition \r\nand limitation by the Russian Federation of the transit \r\nthrough its territory of Ukrainian goods violate the \r\nfreedom of transit under article V of the General \r\nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade of 1994 and the \r\ncustoms valuation of the World Trade Organization.\r\nWe must also draw attention to the provision of \r\nparagraph 1 concerning the combating of terrorist \r\nacts and manifestations of extremism. We express \r\nour disappointment that, although the Commonwealth \r\npositions itself as an active fighter against terrorism \r\nand extremism, it has displayed a total absence of \r\nresponse to the actions of one of its most influential \r\nmembers — the Russian Federation, an aggressor and \r\noccupier country that controls, finances and directs the \r\nillegal armed groups in certain areas of the Donetsk \r\nand Luhansk regions of Ukraine, supplying them \r\nmilitary equipment and weapons. That Russian policy \r\nconstitutes a serious threat to international peace \r\nand security.\r\nIn those circumstances, Ukraine will abstain in \r\nthe voting on draft resolution A/71/L.5 exclusively \r\non the understanding that its adoption should \r\nnot be interpreted as a de jure recognition of the \r\nCommonwealth as a regional arrangement, as defined \r\nin Chapter VIII of the United Nations Charter, bearing \r\nresponsibilities for dealing with matters relating to the \r\nmaintenance of international peace and security, in \r\nparticular for enforcement action under the authority of \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nMs. Aristitelous (Cyprus): In relation to draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.15, entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe”, Cyprus \r\naligns itself with the statement delivered on behalf of \r\nthe European Union and would like to add the following \r\nin its national capacity.\r\nCyprus will assume the chairmanship of the \r\nCommittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe \r\nfrom 22 November until 19 May 2017, for the fifth \r\ntime during its membership to the organization. \r\nCyprus attaches particular importance to enhancing \r\nthe cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Council of Europe in their shared endeavours to \r\npromote and protect human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms in the world, and welcomes in that respect \r\nthe upcoming adoption of today’s draft resolution. The \r\nassumption of the chairmanship comes at a time when \r\nour world faces several challenges — war, economic \r\ndisparities, underdevelopment, poverty, migratory \r\nf lows, terrorism, the rise of populism, xenophobic \r\nrhetoric and extremism — that test our democracies and \r\nshake public trust in State and international institutions. \r\nThe chairmanship will be carried out under the general \r\ntheme “Reinforcing democratic security in Europe” \r\nand will focus on rights and freedoms for all people \r\nwithout any discrimination, democratic citizenship and \r\nthe prevalence of the rule of law.\r\nOur priorities include the protection of cultural \r\nheritage from wanton destruction and the illicit \r\ntrafficking of cultural goods, as we see more and more \r\nincidents wherein antiquities are being targeted by \r\nterrorism and violent extremism or are being stolen and \r\nused to finance terrorism; the issue of migrants being \r\nheld in reception centres, and sometimes in detention \r\ncentres; the role of education in fostering democratic \r\ncitizenship; the role of youth in peacebuilding and \r\nintercultural dialogue; the promotion of equal rights \r\nand improving the quality of life and independence of \r\npeople with disabilities; dealing with homophobic and \r\ntransphobic hate crimes; and the protection of human \r\nrights in the biomedical field.\r\nIn general, our focus will be on issues that have \r\nbeen at the epicentre of recent and ongoing discussions \r\nof the United Nations. We hope that we will encourage \r\nand promote cooperation and synergies between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Council of Europe, leading to \r\nenhanced democratic stability and the promotion of \r\nhuman rights.\r\nMr. Samvelian (Armenia): Armenia commends \r\nthe leadership and competence of the Estonian \r\ndelegation in negotiating draft resolution A/71/L.15, \r\nentitled “Cooperation between the United Nations and \r\nthe Council of Europe”, and welcomes the consensus \r\nreached on it.\r\nAs a member of the Council of Europe, Armenia \r\nreiterates the crucial role of the organization as an \r\nimportant regional platform for cooperation and \r\na repository of legal and practical knowledge and \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 27/33\r\nexpertise in promoting democracy, the rule of law and \r\ngood governance, and protecting human rights and \r\nfundamental freedoms at the regional and national \r\nlevels. Since its independence 25 years ago, including \r\nin the past 15 years of its full membership in the Council \r\nof Europe, Armenia has been a strong beneficiary \r\nof, and contributor to, such cooperation. The Council \r\nof Europe has developed sound and effective legal \r\nfoundations, norms and standards for promoting the \r\ndeclared objectives.\r\nArmenia underlines the valuable partnership \r\nbetween the Council of Europe and the United Nations, \r\nwhich in essence gives prominence to the universality of \r\nhuman rights and the common objectives of promoting \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law. We encourage continued \r\ncooperation among the Council of Europe and various \r\norgans of the United Nations, including the Human \r\nRights Council and its special procedures, the United \r\nNations human rights treaty bodies and the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Human \r\nRights. The Council of Europe has firmly positioned \r\nitself as a valuable contributor to the Universal Periodic \r\nReview process of the Human Rights Council.\r\nThe Council of Europe, together with other regional \r\norganizations in Europe, provides sound foundations \r\nfor effective and advanced regional cooperation in \r\nthe areas of human rights, democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw and in assisting member States in promoting those \r\nobjectives at the national level. Such strong foundations \r\nat the regional level should provide an opportunity for \r\ndue assessment of the effective and efficient division \r\nof labour between regional and global frameworks of \r\ncooperation and scope of engagement at the national \r\nlevel by the respective organizations. This is important \r\nfor the effective use of the available resources of the \r\norganizations, which are known to be limited, and for \r\navoiding the duplication of effort.\r\nWhile engaging in negotiations on the draft \r\nresolution under consideration, Armenia was guided by \r\nthe objective of fully retaining basic European values \r\nreflected in the draft while maintaining full respect of \r\nall human rights and fundamental freedoms, including \r\nthe freedom of expression and opinion and the freedom \r\nof media, specification, inter alia, the promotion and \r\nprotection of journalism and the safety of journalists.\r\nWe regretfully note, however, that Armenia’s \r\nproposals were not properly reflected in the text \r\nduring the negotiations of the draft resolution both in \r\nStrasbourg and New York. The choice of venues for \r\norganizing cooperation forums has become a very \r\nsensitive issue, especially when the venue turns out to \r\nbe a country that, although a member of the Council \r\nof Europe and the United Nations, consistently violates \r\nthe human rights of its people, shuts out Government \r\nopponents, imprisons journalists and human rights \r\ndefenders, and, furthermore, promotes hatred and \r\nintolerance towards other nations and peoples at the \r\nhighest level.\r\nSuch is the case with the choice of Baku as the host \r\nof the first Global Forum on Youth Policies. The Baku \r\nCommitment to Youth Policies was adopted without a \r\nrepresentative of Armenia attending the forum simply \r\nbecause the presence of an Armenian in Baku represents \r\na serious physical security risk. That is a result of the \r\nconsistent Armenophobia promoted by the Government \r\nof Azerbaijan, which glorifies all sorts of atrocities, \r\nincluding the beheading of Armenians.\r\nFinally, the cooperation between the Council \r\nof Europe and the United Nations is poised to be the \r\nsubject of added value and prominence in the light \r\nof the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Within its respective areas of competence, \r\nthe Council of Europe is strongly positioned to \r\nassist its member States in the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda, including in particular Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 16.\r\nIn reiterating its strong support for the continued \r\ncooperation between the Council of Europe and the \r\nUnited Nations, Armenia remains a perennial sponsor \r\nof this draft resolution and calls upon all members to \r\nadopt it by consensus.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in explanation of vote or position \r\nbefore we take decisions.\r\nI now call on the representative of the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic on a point of order.\r\nMr. Al Arsan (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I just wish to clarify any possible confusion \r\nor error with regard to the symbols of the two draft \r\nresolutions. We are requesting votes on the draft \r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the League of Arab States and on the draft \r\nresolution on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.\r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n28/33 16-39494\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now take a decision on draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.5, A/71/L.6, A/71/L.7, A/71/L.9, A/71/L.11, \r\nA/71/L.12, A/71/L.14, A/71/L.15, A/71/L.16 and \r\nA/71/L.17.\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.5 is entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States”. May I take it that it is the wish of \r\nthe General Assembly to adopt it?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.5 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/10).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.6 is entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the League of Arab States”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of draft resolution A/71/L.6 \r\nand in addition to the delegations listed in the draft \r\nresolution, the following countries have also become \r\nsponsors of A/71/L.6: El Salvador, Italy, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Spain and Sweden.\r\nThe present statement is made in accordance \r\nwith rule 153 of the rules of procedure of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and will be made available in the \r\nPaperSmart portal.\r\nUnder the terms of paragraphs 1 and 4 of draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.6, the General Assembly would, \r\nrespectively, request the Secretariat of the United \r\nNations and the League of Arab States to consider the \r\npossibility of forming a high-level working group to \r\nfollow up on the implementation of the provisions of the \r\nprotocol on amendment of the text of the cooperation \r\nagreement between the two organizations until a \r\nliaison office of the League of Arab States is opened \r\nin Cairo, with the aim of improving and achieving \r\nfurther coordination between the two organizations in \r\nthe fields addressed in the protocol; and emphasize the \r\nimportance of holding the thirteenth sectoral meeting \r\nbetween the two organizations and their specialized \r\nagencies, in 2017, concerning cooperation on the \r\npreservation and management of water resources in the \r\nArab region, and the fourteenth general cooperation \r\nmeeting between the two organizations and their \r\nsystems during 2018, for which the dates and venue will \r\nbe agreed upon in due course.\r\nPursuant to paragraph 1 of the draft resolution, it is \r\nunderstood that a liaison office is expected to be opened. \r\nIn the absence of specific details on the establishment \r\nof the liaison office, it is not possible at the present \r\ntime to estimate the potential cost implications of the \r\nrequirements for the liaison office. Upon the decision \r\non the establishment of the liaison office and the related \r\nstaffing and operational requirements, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral would submit the relevant costs of such \r\nrequirements in accordances with rule 153 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly.\r\nWith regard to the request contained in paragraph 4, \r\nit is understood that all issues related to the two meetings, \r\nincluding the dates, venue, format, organization and \r\nscope, are yet to be determined. Accordingly, in the \r\nabsence of modalities for the meetings, it is not possible \r\nat the present time to estimate the potential cost \r\nimplications of the requirements for the meetings and \r\ndocumentation. Upon the decisions on the modalities, \r\nformat and organization of the meetings, the Secretary-\r\nGeneral would submit the relevant costs of such \r\nrequirements in accordance with rule 153 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly. Furthermore, \r\nthe dates of the meetings will have to be determined in \r\nconsultation with the Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management.\r\nAccordingly, the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.6 would not give rise to any financial \r\nimplications under the programme budget for the \r\nbiennium 2016-2017.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): A \r\nrecorded vote has been requested.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAlgeria, Andorra, Argentina, Armenia, \r\nAzerbaijan, Bahrain, Belarus, Belgium, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Cambodia, Cameroon, \r\nCanada, Chile, China, Croatia, Cyprus, Czech \r\nRepublic, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, \r\nEstonia, Ethiopia, Finland, Georgia, Greece, \r\nGuatemala, Guinea, Hungary, Iran (Islamic \r\nRepublic of), Iraq, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, Jordan, \r\nKazakhstan, Kuwait, Kyrgyzstan, Lebanon, Libya, \r\nLiechtenstein, Lithuania, Maldives, Malta, Mexico, \r\nMongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, Myanmar, \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Oman, \r\nPakistan, Papua New Guinea, Peru, Philippines, \r\nPortugal, Qatar, Republic of Korea, Republic of \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 29/33\r\nMoldova, Romania, Russian Federation, Rwanda, \r\nSan Marino, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Singapore, \r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sudan, Sweden, \r\nSwitzerland, Tajikistan, Thailand, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Togo, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Ukraine, United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, United Republic of Tanzania, \r\nUnited States of America\r\nAgainst:\r\nNone\r\nAbstaining:\r\nCentral African Republic, Congo, Germany, \r\nIndonesia, Syrian Arab Republic\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.6 was adopted by 84 votes \r\nto none, with 5 abstentions (resolution 71/11).\r\n[Subsequently, the delegations of El Salvador, \r\nFrance, Germany, India, Italy, Micronesia \r\n(Federated States of ) and Poland informed the \r\nSecretariat that they had intended to vote in favour.] \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.7 is entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Collective Security Treaty \r\nOrganization”. May I take it that it is the wish of the \r\nGeneral Assembly to adopt it?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.7 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/12).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.9 is entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Central European Initiative”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly and \r\nConference Management): I should like to announce that \r\nsince the submission of the draft resolution, in addition \r\nto those delegations listed in the document, Georgia has \r\nbecome a sponsor of draft resolution A/71/L.9.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May \r\nI take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.9?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.9 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/13).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.11 is entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization”. May I take it that the Assembly decides \r\nto adopt it?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.11 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/14).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.12 is entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Organization for Democracy \r\nand Economic Development”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution, in \r\naddition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nPoland has become a sponsor of draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.12.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May \r\nI take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.12?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.12 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/15).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.14 is entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Economic Cooperation \r\nOrganization”. May I take it that the Assembly decides \r\nto adopt it?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.14 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/16).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.15 is entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Council of Europe”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution, in \r\naddition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nArmenia and Mexico have become sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.15.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May \r\nI take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.15?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.15 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/17).\r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n30/33 16-39494\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.16/Rev.1 is entitled “Cooperation \r\nbetween the United Nations and the Black Sea Economic \r\nCooperation Organization”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution, in \r\naddition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.16/Rev.1: Austria, Hungary, \r\nMontenegro and Spain.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May \r\nI take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.16/Rev.1?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.16/Rev.1 was adopted \r\n(resolution 71/18).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.17 is entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the International Criminal \r\nPolice Organization”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution, in \r\naddition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.17: Albania, Algeria, Andorra, \r\nArgentina, Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Canada, China, \r\nCyprus, the Czech Republic, Georgia, Hungary, Israel, \r\nItaly, Jamaica, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malawi, \r\nMalta, Mexico, Monaco, Nauru, the Netherlands, New \r\nZealand, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Romania, Samoa, San Marino, Serbia, \r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, Ukraine and Uruguay.\r\nAlso in connection with draft resolution A/71/L.17, \r\nI wish to put on the record the following statement \r\nof financial implications on behalf of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, which is also available on the PaperSmart \r\nportal, in accordance with rule 153 of the rules of \r\nprocedure of the General Assembly.\r\nIn paragraph 5 of draft resolution A/71/L.17, the \r\nGeneral Assembly would request that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral submit to the General Assembly, at its \r\nseventy-third session, a report on the implementation \r\nof the resolution. It is anticipated that the request will \r\nconstitute an addition to the documentation workload of \r\nthe Department for General Assembly and Conference \r\nManagement of one document of 8,500 words, to be \r\nissued in all six official languages, which would entail \r\nadditional requirements in the amount of $37,600 for \r\ndocumentation services in 2018. Accordingly, should the \r\nGeneral Assembly adopt draft resolution A/71/L.17, the \r\nadditional resources requirement of $37,600 that would \r\narise for 2018 under section 2, “General Assembly and \r\nEconomic and Social Council affairs and conference \r\nmanagement”, will be included in the proposed \r\nprogramme budget for the biennium 2018-2019.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May \r\nI take it that the Assembly decides to adopt draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.17?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.17 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/19).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Before \r\ngiving the f loor to speakers in explanation of vote or \r\nposition on the resolutions just adopted, I should like to \r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Samvelian (Armenia): While my delegation \r\njoined in the consensus on resolution 71/15, we would \r\nlike to express our concern about the fact that one \r\nof the resolution’s main sponsors, Azerbaijan, has \r\nregularly misused the Organization for Democracy and \r\nEconomic Development in order to present its distorted \r\ninterpretation of the process for resolving the conflict \r\nin Nagorno Karabakh. That does not contribute in any \r\nway to the negotiations conducted in the framework \r\nof the agreed format of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe Minsk Group co-chairship, \r\non the basis of purposes and principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations — specifically, the \r\nnon-use or threat of use of force, the self-determination \r\nof peoples, and countries’ territorial integrity.\r\nMs. Aristotelous (Cyprus): Regarding resolution \r\n71/16, entitled “Cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the Economic Cooperation Organization”, \r\nmy delegation would like to state for the record that \r\nCyprus dissociates itself from the consensus on the \r\nresolution for the following reasons.\r\nIn operative paragraph 2, the resolution takes note \r\nof the Baku Declaration, issued at the twelfth Economic \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 31/33\r\nCooperation Organization (ECO) summit meeting of its \r\nHeads of State and/or Government, held on 16 October \r\n2012 in Azerbaijan. The Baku Declaration endorsed the \r\nreport of the Organization’s Council of Ministers at their \r\ntwentieth meeting and instructed the Secretary General \r\nof ECO to ensure that the report was fully implemented.\r\nWe are informed that the report recommends that \r\nthe so-called Turkish Cypriot State be given observer \r\nstatus in the Economic Cooperation Organization. \r\nThe Baku Declaration in effect calls on the Secretary \r\nGeneral of ECO to act contrary to Security Council and \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions on Cyprus, particularly \r\nSecurity Council resolutions 541 (1983) and 550 (1984), \r\nwhich state that the declaration of a purported secession \r\nof part of the Republic of Cyprus is legally invalid \r\nand call for its withdrawal. By those resolutions, the \r\nSecurity Council condemns all secessionist acts, calling \r\non all States to respect the sovereignty, independence \r\nand territorial integrity of the Republic of Cyprus \r\nand not to recognize any Cypriot State other than the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus. The Council also urges States \r\nnot to facilitate or assist the secessionist entity in any \r\nway. In that regard, I would also like to recall General \r\nAssembly resolutions 3212 (XXIX) and 37/253, of \r\n1983, which call on all States to respect the sovereignty, \r\nindependence and territorial integrity of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus.\r\nMy delegation reiterates those calls made by \r\nthe United Nations to the States members of the \r\nEconomic Cooperation Organization. We urge them \r\nand the Secretary General of ECO not to act contrary \r\nto United Nations resolutions by implementing \r\nthe recommendation to accord observer status to a \r\nsecessionist entity. We have decided not to break the \r\nconsensus on today’s resolution on cooperation, based \r\non the good faith and spirit of cooperation displayed \r\nby its sponsors during the informal negotiations on \r\nthe text. We hope that same spirit will be displayed \r\nin response to the call we have just made, that \r\nthe Economic Cooperation Organization and its \r\nmember States will re-evaluate their position on \r\nthe issue and, in consideration of their cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations, act in compliance with our \r\nOrganization’s Charter.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in explanation of vote or position \r\nafter the voting.\r\nI now give the f loor to those representatives who \r\nwish to speak in exercise of the right of reply. I would \r\nlike to remind members that statements in exercise of \r\nthe right of reply are limited to 10 minutes for the first \r\nintervention and to five minutes for the second, and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): The irrelevant statements \r\nmade by the representative of Armenia with regard \r\nto two of the resolutions just adopted by the General \r\nAssembly are examples of its attempts to create an \r\nerroneous impression of the real situation and deflect \r\nthe international community’s attention from the \r\nurgent need to address the chief problems caused by \r\nArmenia’s continued aggression against Azerbaijan. \r\nArmenia’s allegations of so-called Armenophobia are \r\nnot worthy of criticism. Suffice it to say that, unlike \r\nArmenia — which has implemented a policy of total \r\nethnic cleansing of all non-Armenians in both its own \r\nterritory and the occupied territories of Azerbaijan, \r\nand has thereby succeeded in creating a uniquely \r\nmono-ethnic culture in them — Azerbaijan has \r\npreserved its ethnic and cultural diversity to this day.\r\nThe representative of Armenia asserted that his \r\ncountry was not represented at one of the international \r\nconferences held in Baku and mentioned in resolution \r\n71/17, on cooperation between the United Nations \r\nand the Council of Europe. However, he passed in \r\nsilence over the fact that many Armenians, including \r\nArmenian citizens, visited Azerbaijan both before and \r\nafter that conference in order to participate in various \r\ninternational conferences and sports events held there. \r\nIf there is anywhere in the world that is insecure for \r\nthe citizens of Armenia, it is their own country, \r\nArmenia itself.\r\nThe international community has repeatedly \r\nexpressed its indignation at the Armenian leadership’s \r\nundisguised promotion of odious notions of racial \r\nsuperiority and ethnic and religious incompatibility, \r\nand its expressions of hatred towards Azerbaijan and \r\nothers of its neighbours, while the relevant United \r\nNations bodies and other international organizations \r\nhave repeatedly expressed their serious concerns about \r\nthe spirit of intolerance that prevails in Armenia and the \r\ndiscriminatory policies and practices it pursues. The \r\ndirect involvement of the current political and military \r\nleadership of Armenia, including its incumbent and \r\nformer Presidents, in the brutal massacres conducted \r\nduring its aggression against Azerbaijan that claimed \r\nthe lives of thousands of Azerbaijani civilians, including \r\nA/71/PV.48 21/11/2016\r\n32/33 16-39494\r\nchildren, women and the elderly, is well known and \r\nthoroughly documented. Against that background, it \r\nis curious that the representative of Armenia should \r\ncriticize and lecture others on notions that are a priori \r\nalien to his country’s policy and practice.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to recall some of the \r\nrelevant decisions and documents of international \r\norganizations, including General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, condemning Armenia’s \r\nuse of force against Azerbaijan and calling for an \r\nend to the occupation of Azerbaijani territories. I am \r\nconfident that a careful reading of those documents and \r\ndecisions would convince the delegation of Armenia \r\nto refrain from wasting time by making irrelevant and \r\nout-of-context statements in the future.\r\nMr. Samvelian (Armenia): It should be emphasized \r\nthat many conflicts, including that in Nagorno Karabakh, \r\nare the result of systematic violations of human rights, \r\naggravated by precarious situations where the rule of \r\nlaw is concerned. Countries that violate human rights \r\nsystematically and unapologetically tend to be part of \r\nthe problem rather than the solution when it comes to \r\nresolving such conflicts. Azerbaijan’s appalling human \r\nrights record and totalitarian tendencies are a case in \r\npoint. Obviously, no country, including one that acts \r\naggressively, will accept that. Such countries would \r\nrather blame their opponents for unleashing military \r\naggression, and that is the case with Azerbaijan.\r\nNonetheless, I do not want to engage in lengthy \r\ndiscussions with Azerbaijan, and our point was made \r\npretty clearly when we spoke from the rostrum. I \r\nwould just like to respond briefly to the mention of \r\nmy country’s leadership in Azerbaijan’s statement. \r\nI understand the jealousy of the representative of \r\nAzerbaijan, a country that has been led by a single \r\nfamily for almost 50 years. Meanwhile, we in Armenia \r\nhave a President who is democratically elected for no \r\nmore than two terms of office. That should be enough \r\nfor Azerbaijan to understand the difference between \r\nthe situations in Armenia and Azerbaijan, which should \r\nnot even be compared with each other.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nremind speakers once again to limit their statements to \r\nfive minutes.\r\nMr. Aliyev (Azerbaijan): The remarks just made by \r\nthe representative of Armenia are distorting, as well as \r\nself-contradictory in their substance and unacceptable \r\nin their tone. He goes so far as to lecture other \r\nMember States on principles and values that in fact his \r\nGovernment consistently disregards and opposes.\r\nIn reality, the primary objective of the ongoing \r\npeace process aimed at resolving the conflict in and \r\naround the Nagorno Karabakh region of Azerbaijan is \r\nto ensure the unconditional and complete withdrawal \r\nof Armenia’s armed forces from the region and the \r\nother occupied territories of Azerbaijan, along with \r\nthe exercise by the forcibly displaced population of \r\ntheir inalienable right to return to their homes and \r\nproperties. Rather than wasting time and misleading \r\nboth its own people and the international community, \r\nthe Government of Armenia should reconsider its \r\nunconstructive position, which will become more and \r\nmore difficult to stick to. The sooner that happens, the \r\nsooner the conflict will be resolved and the countries \r\nand peoples of the region benefit from the prospects of \r\ncooperation and economic development.\r\nMr. Samvelian (Armenia): I will be brief. In order to \r\ndemonstrate its commitment to the peaceful settlement \r\nof the Nagorno Karabakh conflict, Azerbaijan should \r\nas a first step engage immediately and unconditionally \r\nin the implementation of the agreements reached in \r\nVienna and Saint Petersburg in May and June. A refusal \r\nto implement them will leave it with the burden of full \r\nresponsibility for the lack of progress in settling the \r\nNagorno Karabakh peace process.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nconclude its consideration of sub-items (d), (i), (l), (o), \r\n(u), (v), (w), (x) and (y) of agenda item 126?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): Before \r\nconcluding the meeting, however, I would like to appeal \r\nto those Member States intending to submit draft \r\nresolutions on the remaining sub-items to do so as soon \r\nas possible.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 126 and its \r\nremaining sub-items.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFinally, I should like to consult members regarding \r\nan extension of the work of the Second Committee. \r\nMembers will recall that at its 2nd plenary meeting, \r\non 16 September 2016, the General Assembly approved \r\n21/11/2016 A/71/PV.48\r\n16-39494 33/33\r\nthe recommendation of the General Committee that the \r\nSecond Committee complete its work by Wednesday, \r\n23 November. However, I have been informed by the \r\nChair of the Second Committee that the Committee \r\nrequests an extension of its work to Wednesday, \r\n30 November, in view of the fact that such an extension \r\nwould facilitate reaching consensus on the pending \r\nresolutions before the Committee.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to extend the work of the Second Committee \r\nuntil Wednesday, 30 November 2016?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.35 p.m.\r\n"
