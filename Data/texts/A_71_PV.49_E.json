(Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nTribute to the memory of His Excellency Mr. Fidel \r\nAlejandro Castro Ruz, former President of the \r\nCouncils of State and Ministers of the Republic \r\nof Cuba\r\nThe President: Before we proceed to consider the \r\nitems on our agenda, it is my sad duty to pay tribute \r\nto the memory of the former President of the Councils \r\nof State and Ministers of the Republic of Cuba, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz, who passed \r\naway on Friday, 25 November.\r\nI am deeply saddened by the passing of Fidel \r\nCastro, and I wish to express my sincere condolences to \r\nhis family, including his brother, President Raúl Castro, \r\nthe Government and the people of Cuba. On behalf of \r\nthe General Assembly, I request the representatives of \r\nCuba to convey these condolences.\r\nFidel Castro was one of the iconic leaders of the \r\ntwentieth century. With a great love for his homeland \r\nand the Cuban people, he dedicated his life to their \r\nwelfare and development. A tireless advocate for equity \r\nin the international arena, he was an inspirational figure \r\nfor developing countries in particular. His dedication to \r\ntheir advancement, especially in the fields of education \r\nand health, will be long remembered.\r\nI now invite representatives to stand and observe \r\na minute of silence in tribute to the memory of His \r\nExcellency Mr. Fidel Alejandro Castro Ruz.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly observed a \r\nminute of silence.\r\nAgenda item 35\r\nQuestion of Palestine\r\nReport of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People \r\n(A/71/35)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/359)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/71/174)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/71/L.18, A/71/L.19, \r\nA/71/L.20 and A/71/L.21)\r\nThe President: Today’s meeting takes place at a \r\ntime when the Middle East region is being rocked by \r\ninstability. Brutal conflicts in Syria and Yemen, a \r\nrefugee crisis that is f looding neighbouring countries, \r\nthe virulent spread of extremism and terrorism, and \r\nthe ongoing construction of settlements on Palestinian \r\nterritory are combining to create a highly combustible \r\nsituation across the region. For many, the prospects for \r\npeace and security feel desperately out of reach. We are \r\nall gravely concerned about the deteriorating security \r\nand humanitarian situations in many parts of the \r\nMiddle East. I call on parties to make genuine efforts \r\nto find peaceful solutions and to cooperate closely with \r\nthe United Nations and humanitarian agencies to enable \r\nthem to deliver urgently needed humanitarian, food and \r\nmedical assistance.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It \r\nis a situation that has reverberations around the region. \r\nAs the Assembly has said, achieving a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive settlement of the question of Palestine \r\nis imperative for the attainment of comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace and stability in the Middle East.\r\nThe ongoing role of the United Nations in the \r\npeaceful settlement of the question of Palestine is clear, \r\nwith the General Assembly repeatedly affirming that \r\nthe United Nations has permanent responsibility with \r\nregard to the question of Palestine until the question \r\nis resolved in all aspects and in accordance with \r\ninternational law. To that end, I call for all involved \r\nto urgently take concrete steps to bring an end to the \r\nviolence, comply strictly with international law, restore \r\npolitical trust, build a climate for peace and resume \r\nmeaningful negotiations.\r\nThat includes all leaders refraining from provocative \r\nactions, incitement and inflammatory rhetoric, which \r\nare incompatible with advancing a negotiated two-\r\nState solution and serve only to perpetuate the cycles of \r\nviolence and conflict. It includes freezing the building \r\nof Israeli settlements on Palestinian territory, which \r\nthe General Assembly has repeatedly affirmed to be \r\nillegal and to have a detrimental impact on efforts to \r\nresume and advance the peace process. It includes by \r\nrespecting the historic status quo at the holy places \r\nof Jerusalem, including Al-Haram al-Sharif, in both \r\nwords and practice. And it includes all parties taking \r\nconfidence-building measures aimed at improving the \r\nsituation on the ground, promoting stability, building \r\ntrust and fostering the peace process.\r\nTo that end, I would like to acknowledge the work \r\nbeing undertaken by civil society to promote a peaceful \r\nsettlement of the question of Palestine. Despite the \r\nsetbacks over the years, I remain hopeful that renewed \r\ninternational efforts can help to pave the way to \r\nrealizing the two-State solution of Israel and Palestine \r\nliving side by side in peace, security and prosperity \r\nwithin recognized borders, based on the pre-1967 lines.\r\nI would like to take the opportunity of today’s \r\ndebate to acknowledge the vital work of the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA). For \r\nover 65 years, UNRWA has played a critical role in \r\nsupporting the welfare and development of some \r\n5 million Palestinian refugees. That includes through \r\neducation, health, relief and social services, support \r\nfor camp infrastructure, provision of microfinance and \r\nemergency assistance and efforts to eliminate violence \r\nagainst women and girls.\r\nThe generational impacts of the work of UNRWA \r\nto support Palestinian refugees cannot be overstated, \r\nand I sincerely thank the donors and hosts of UNRWA \r\nfor their support. That support, including the responses \r\nto the emergency appeals of UNRWA, have helped \r\nto provide education and opportunity for Palestinian \r\nyouth, and to counter potential radicalization that has \r\naffected so many other populations with high levels of \r\nyouth unemployment.\r\nThe mandate of UNRWA originates from the \r\nGeneral Assembly, and it is therefore to those present \r\nthat I turn to express my deep concern at the serious \r\nfunding gap that has emerged and is threatening the \r\nability of UNRWA to continue its work in providing \r\nrelief to the Palestine refugees. I urge all Member States \r\nto respond generously and expeditiously to the efforts \r\nof UNRWA to fill its $74 million funding gap and to \r\nensure that it has sufficient funds to be able to carry \r\nout its activities in an effective and predictable manner.\r\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict may be long-\r\nstanding and the situation in the Middle East may \r\nbe complex, but we, the international community, \r\nmust never let that discourage us or undermine our \r\ncommitment to finding just, lasting and sustainable \r\npeace. As long as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\ncontinues, it poses a threat to international peace \r\nand security. And so long as it continues, the lives of \r\nmillions of Palestine people, refugees and others across \r\nthe region will be negatively impacted by unrest and \r\ninstability. I therefore urge all parties and stakeholders \r\nto be courageous and committed to their efforts to \r\nfinding a lasting, peaceful political solution to bring \r\nthe conflict to an end.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of \r\nSenegal, who will speak on behalf of the Chair of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People, to introduce draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.18, A/71/L.19, A/71/L.20 and A/71/L.21.\r\nMr. Ciss (Senegal) (spoke in French): Allow me at \r\nthe outset to thank all delegations and you personally, \r\nMr. President, for having taken such an active part in \r\nthe special meeting of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 3/25\r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People marking \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople. The messages and statements of support we \r\nheard this morning, sent by leaders from around the \r\nworld, testify in one voice to the firm resolve of the \r\ninternational community to support the rights of the \r\nPalestinians and to reach a fair and lasting solution to \r\nthe Palestinian question, that of two States living side \r\nby side in peace and security, as demanded for decades \r\nby the United Nations resolutions on the issue. I also \r\nnote that the Committee received messages of solidarity \r\nfrom the Presidents of Algeria and Sierra Leone.\r\nToday, we are here to debate the question of \r\nPalestine on the sixty-ninth anniversary of the adoption \r\nof resolution 181 (II) on the partition of historic Palestine \r\ninto the State of Israel and the State of Palestine. \r\nHowever, the second country, the State of Palestine, has \r\nseen its independence rejected to this very day. Next year \r\nwill not only mark seven decades of broken promises by \r\nthe United Nations to the Palestinian people, it will also \r\nbe the fiftieth anniversary of the occupation by Israel \r\nof Palestinian lands and their inhabitants. Those 50 \r\nyears of occupation mean 50 years of settlements and \r\ncolonization; 50 years of annexation of East Jerusalem \r\nand 50 years of oppression and collective punishment \r\nof Palestinians and their lives, hopes and future. In \r\nshort, it has been 50 years of the denial of basic human \r\nrights, amounting to a refusal to ensure liberty. That is \r\nthe true heart of the issue of Palestine — rejecting the \r\nfreedom of Palestinian people.\r\nWe all recognize that liberty is a fundamental \r\nfreedom and that without it, other rights are severely \r\neroded or, worse yet, made meaningless. An occupying \r\nPower is not only required to ensure the social \r\nand economic well-being of the occupied people; \r\noccupation is also meant to be a temporary state of \r\naffairs and not an ongoing or permanent regime, and it \r\nshould certainly not perpetually deprive the occupied \r\npeople of their freedom and right to self-determination. \r\nFurthermore, the occupiers, or colonizers, have always \r\nfailed in their attempts to use the carrot and the stick \r\nto lead the dominated people to surrender, willingly or \r\nnot. No one should be obliged to surrender and accept \r\nimprisonment, however gilded the cage may be. Freedom \r\nis not a reward delivered by a benevolent superior. It \r\nis the fundamental and inalienable right of all peoples, \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, and it is \r\nthe right of all nations. It is not subordinate to the desire \r\nof some third party or based on a certificate of good \r\nconduct or permit issued by the occupier.\r\nOur Committee shall continue to defend the \r\ninalienable rights of the Palestinians, beginning with \r\ntheir right to self-determination. We are pleased to \r\nnote that Member States, including France, Russia \r\nand Egypt, as well as the Middle East Quartet, are \r\nalso striving to find ways to make progress towards \r\nsettling the Palestinian issue in all its aspects and \r\nin a fair and peaceful manner. We therefore call for \r\nevery effort to be made, in the name of justice, to end \r\nalmost half a century of occupation and the drawn-\r\nout tragedy of Palestinian refugees and to promote the \r\nindependence and sovereignty of a Palestinian State \r\nliving side by side with Israel and all its neighbours, in \r\nline with international law, the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions, the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, which have long been the reference points \r\nand parameters for a fair and lasting solution.\r\nWe know and understand that the international \r\ncommunity is facing many pressing problems and \r\ncrises. One would think the question of Palestine would \r\nat least be counted among those crises, as it is a harsh \r\nreality for those Palestinians who have abandoned all \r\nhope for a solution in the near future, to the extent that \r\nthey are now seeking refuge throughout the region and \r\nbeyond — to Europe, Asia and Africa. Yet nothing \r\ncould be further from the truth. Let us consider for a \r\nmoment the desperate situation of Palestinians in the \r\nGaza Strip or the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, \r\nor of Palestinian refugees in Syria in this period of \r\nserious conflict, Lebanon or elsewhere in the region. \r\nThe absence of hope and political prospects that might \r\nmitigate this desolate reality and ensure the realization \r\nof rights that have been denied for so long, has had a \r\nprofound, destabilizing impact and makes the status \r\nquo clearly untenable.\r\nFurthermore, when we see violent extremist groups \r\nthreaten our planet by carrying out attacks throughout \r\nthe world that provoke f lows of refugees to our borders \r\nand poison the hearts and spirits of the youth, we cannot \r\ndoubt that the primary tool used by such groups is the \r\nopen wound of the serious injustice in Palestine, and that \r\nthe international community, represented by the United \r\nNations, remains incapable of resolving the situation in \r\nspite of all the words spoken and commitments made \r\ndown the years.\r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n4/25 16-40519\r\nEach day that passes in this climate of injustice; \r\nevery photo of the colonization and usurpation of \r\nPalestinian lands; every video showing an Israeli hit \r\na child or humiliate a Palestinian man or woman; and \r\nevery extension of the blockade that Israel continues \r\nto impose mercilessly on Gaza only fuels the narrative \r\nof extremist groups, and helps such groups the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Levant and Al-Qaeda to recruit \r\nmarginalized and desperate young people. The conflict \r\naround the Palestinian issue is not an issue related \r\nto just a few people and never will be. It is not just a \r\nregional issue; it is global problem whose impact is felt \r\nby us all no matter where we live.\r\nBeyond the pragmatic questions, allow me to \r\nreassert before this Organization, which is responsible \r\nat the global level for protecting and ensuring that \r\nhuman rights are respected, that no individual is free \r\nunless all individuals are free. The life of Palestinians is \r\npriceless, to use a trending slogan. As we commemorate \r\nthe adoption of resolution 181 (II) and as we approach \r\nthe fiftieth anniversary of the Israeli occupation and \r\nthe seventieth anniversary of the partition of Palestine, \r\nwe must recommit ourselves to implementing the \r\nprovisions that have been adopted over the decades \r\nby the General Assembly and the Security Council \r\nto promote the realization of the rights of Palestinian \r\npeople and a just, lasting, comprehensive and peaceful \r\nsolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which is at \r\nthe heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict.\r\nThe Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People will continue to do \r\nits utmost to defend those rights and move towards \r\na peaceful settlement of the conflict. We will do so \r\nin cooperation with our partners: Member States, \r\ninternational organizations and members of civil \r\nsociety. We reaffirm that our door is open and that \r\nwe are happy to hear all points of view. It is through \r\ncommunication, not through confrontation, that we will \r\nresolve the Palestinian question.\r\nWe will also continue to invite to our meetings \r\nand events all Member States, including Israel, and \r\ncivil-society organizations on both sides, Israeli and \r\nPalestinian alike. The Committee is proud to help those \r\nactors meet, debate and exchange ideas in a secure \r\nframework, to work together to promote peace and \r\njustice. By failing to take part in our debates, some \r\nMembers of the Organization only ensure that their \r\npoints of view will not be taken into acount. We therefore \r\ncall on all delegations to support the diplomatic, legal \r\nand political activities of the Committee in fulfilment \r\nof its mandate, rather than spread unfounded lies.\r\nI shall now introduce to the General Assembly \r\nthe four draft resolutions adopted by the Committee \r\nunder this agenda item: draft resolutions A/71/L.18, \r\nA/71/L.19, A/71/L.20 and A/71/L.21. The approval of \r\nthe Committee followed consultations with relevant \r\nregional groups.\r\nThe first three draft resolutions concern the work \r\nof the Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People, the Division for \r\nPalestinian Rights of the Secretariat, and the special \r\ninformation programme on the question of Palestine \r\nof the Department of Public Information. The General \r\nAssembly reaffirms therein the importance of the \r\nmandates that it has assigned to those entities. As in the \r\npast, the Committee seeks to ensure that all resources \r\nit is given are used in an efficient manner. Allow me to \r\noutline some aspects of the draft resolutions.\r\nAs members will note, by draft resolution A/71/L.18, \r\nwhich addresses the renewal of the Committee’s \r\nmandate, the General Assembly would request the \r\nCommittee, in the light of the onset of the fiftieth \r\nyear of the Israeli occupation, to focus its activities \r\nthroughout 2017 on efforts and initiatives to end the \r\nIsraeli occupation and contribute to a just peace.\r\nBy the second draft resolution, A/71/L.19, the \r\nGeneral Assembly would renew the mandate of the \r\nDivision for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat, and \r\nrequest the Secretary-General to continue to provide \r\nthe Division with the necessary resources and to ensure \r\nthat it continues to effectively carry out its programme \r\nof work.\r\nIn draft resolution A/71/L.20, which relates to \r\nthe special information programme on the question \r\nof Palestine of the Department of Public Information, \r\nthe General Assembly would renew the mandate of the \r\nDepartment and call upon it to continue those initiatives \r\nthat contribute to the creation of a favourable climate \r\nfor dialogue and the advancement of peace efforts.\r\nIn draft resolution A/71/L.21, entitled “Peaceful \r\nsettlement of the Palestinian question”, the General \r\nAssembly would reaffirm its position regarding the \r\nessential elements of such a settlement. The draft \r\nresolution refers to facts that have come to light in the \r\npast year. It stressing the urgent need for efforts to \r\nreverse the negative trends on the ground and to restore \r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 5/25\r\na political horizon for advancing and accelerating \r\nmeaningful negotiations aimed at the achievement of a \r\npeace agreement that will bring a complete end to the \r\nIsraeli occupation that began in 1967 and the resolution \r\nof all core final status issues, without exception, \r\nleading to a peaceful, just, lasting and comprehensive \r\nsolution of the question of Palestine. The draft \r\nresolution urges renewed and coordinated efforts by the \r\ninternational community aimed at restoring a political \r\nhorizon, welcomes the initiative launched by France, \r\nthe ongoing efforts of the Quartet and the initiatives \r\ntaken by Egypt and Russia. It reiterates the demand \r\nfor the consideration of measures of accountability, \r\nin accordance with international law, if Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, continues to ignore appeals for a \r\ncomplete end of settlement activities in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, including in East Jerusalem. \r\nThat is a prerequisite for preserving the possibilities \r\nof achieving a two-State solution within the pre-1967 \r\nborders, putting a final end to the Israeli occupation \r\nand ensuring the realization of the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people.\r\nWe call on the Assembly to lend its firm and \r\nlegitimate support for those texts and hope it does so.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nRapporteur of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People to introduce \r\nthe Committee’s report.\r\nMr. Inguanez (Malta), Rapporteur of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People: It is an honour for me, in \r\nmy capacity as Rapporteur of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, to present to the General Assembly the \r\nCommittee’s annual report (A/71/35). The report covers \r\ndevelopments relating to the question of Palestine and \r\ndetails the work of the Committee between 7 October \r\n2015 and 3 October 2016. Allow me to summarize each \r\nsection of the report.\r\nFollowing the introduction, chapter II provides \r\na review of the situation relating to the question of \r\nPalestine, as monitored by the Committee, in order to \r\ndraw the attention of the international community to \r\nissues requiring urgent attention, such as the impasse \r\nin the peace process, dire living conditions, the \r\nreconstruction of the Gaza Strip, extrajudicial killings, \r\nthe excessive use of force by the Israeli occupying \r\nforces, heightened provocations and tensions at the \r\nAl-Aqsa Mosque compound and other religious \r\nsites, ongoing illegal Israeli settlement activities,and \r\nincreasing house demolitions in the West Bank, \r\nincluding in East Jerusalem.\r\nIn chapters III and IV, the report outlines the \r\nmandate entrusted to the Committee by the General \r\nAssembly, and contains information on the organization \r\nof the Committee’s work during the year.\r\nChapter V contains the action taken by the \r\nCommittee, including the Chairman’s participation \r\nin the Security Council debates and the continued \r\ndialogue between the Committee and members of \r\nintergovernmental organizations with the objective of \r\nmobilizing wide support for the inalienable rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people and urging action.\r\nChapter VI provides an overview of the special \r\ninformation programme on the question of Palestine \r\ncarried out by the Department of Public Information \r\npursuant to resolution 70/14, of 24 November 2015, \r\nas well as of activities reported by the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees \r\nin the Near East (UNRWA) and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme.\r\nThe last chapter of the report is devoted to the \r\nconclusions and recommendations of the Committee. \r\nIn view of the stalled negotiations, the Committee \r\nwould welcome the revitalization of the peace \r\nnegotiations as well as the efforts of any country that \r\nis able to advance the peace process, conceivably with \r\nsupport from a reinvigorated Quartet, in order to reach \r\na comprehensive regional solution. The Committee \r\nwould also urge the Security Council and the General \r\nAssembly to give positive consideration to proposals \r\nseeking to find a way out of the current impasse. Allow \r\nme to recall additional key recommendations.\r\nIn relation to Gaza, the Committee would reiterate \r\nits calls on the international community to demand \r\nthe lifting of the blockade. It would also call upon \r\ninternational donors to fulfil all pledges without delay \r\nin order to expedite reconstruction efforts and to \r\nsecure funding for long-term humanitarian assistance, \r\nincluding for UNRWA.\r\nIn connection with Israel’s continued policy of \r\nillegal occupation and settlement-building in the \r\noccupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, the Committee \r\nwould welcome further measures by the Human Rights \r\nCouncil to expedite the implementation of its resolution \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n6/25 16-40519\r\n31/36, calling for the creation of a database of all actors \r\nconducting business in areas under Israeli military \r\noccupation. That is consistent with the stance taken \r\nby the European Union on the importation of products \r\nfrom illegal Israeli settlements. The Committee would \r\nencourage other organizations and States to adopt \r\nand implement policies that guarantee the adherence \r\nto international conventions with regard to illegal \r\nsettlements in occupied areas, particularly the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention. It would welcome further steps \r\nby Governments and private businesses to dissociate \r\nthemselves from policies which directly or indirectly \r\nsupport settlements.\r\nThe Committee would continue to encourage \r\ncivil-society partners to work with their national \r\nGovernments, parliamentarians and other institutions \r\nwith a view to gaining their full support for the work \r\nof the Committee and the United Nations, as a whole.\r\nTo ensure that Governments actively support the \r\nrealization of a peaceful and just settlement of the \r\nquestion of Palestine, the Committee would reach \r\nout to all regional groups at the United Nations. \r\nRecognizing the growing importance of cooperation \r\nwith developing countries and regional and subregional \r\norganizations in sharing experiences and implementing \r\nreplicable solutions, it will make a special effort to step \r\nup engagement with such countries and organizations \r\nin the context of the South-South and triangular \r\ncooperation framework.\r\nThe Committee would suggest that its programme \r\nof international meetings and conferences in 2017 be \r\nfocused on amplifying international support for the \r\nfulfilment of the inalienable rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople and bringing the Israeli occupation to a \r\ncomplete end.\r\nThe Committee would strongly recommend that \r\nthe annual capacity-building programme for the \r\nstaff of the Palestinian Government, managed by the \r\nDivision for Palestinian Rights, be continued and, \r\nwhere possible, further expanded in the light of the \r\nState of Palestine’s commitment to fulfilling the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. The Committee \r\nwould also request that the Division continue its \r\nsubstantive support for the secretariat, its research and \r\nmonitoring programmes, as well as publications and \r\nother informational activities, in furtherance of the \r\nCommittee’s communication strategy.\r\nFinally, in view of the tragic approach of the \r\nfiftieth year of Israeli occupation and the seventieth \r\nyear since the partition, and to underscore the absolute \r\nurgency of achieving a just and lasting solution to the \r\nquestion of Palestine, the Committee calls upon the \r\nentire membership of the General Assembly to join it \r\nin that endeavour.\r\nIn closing, I would like to express the hope that the \r\nreport that I have just presented will be of assistance \r\nto the General Assembly in its deliberations on the \r\nquestion of Palestine.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nPermanent Observer of the observer State of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine): I thank you, \r\nMr. President, for your principled statement and for \r\nthe convening of this important General Assembly \r\ndebate, which coincides with the thirty-ninth annual \r\nobservance of the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. On this solemn day, as we \r\nreflect upon the painful, grave injustice that continues \r\nto be borne by the Palestinian people, the messages of \r\nsupport for the just cause of Palestine and the moving \r\nexpressions of solidarity are not only a source of \r\ncomfort, but also help to shore up our resilience in these \r\ntimes of diminished hope.\r\nAs we approach the date marking 50 years since the \r\nonset of Israel’s occupation in June 1967, as well as the \r\nseventieth year of the Assembly’s partition of Mandate \r\nPalestine and Al-Nakba that followed and is still suffered \r\nby our people to this day, we are compelled to convey \r\nour hope that this time next year the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People may be observed \r\nwith a commemoration of the achievement of a just, \r\ncomprehensive and lasting solution to the question of \r\nPalestine, a celebration of the independence of the State \r\nof Palestine and a realization of Palestinian freedom \r\nand rights and genuine Palestinian-Israeli peace.\r\nThis may sound like wishful thinking, considering \r\nthe harsh realities that overwhelm us and the fatigue \r\nfelt by the international community after so many \r\nyears of conflict, setbacks and tragedy, yet it remains \r\nour primary, overarching objective, guiding all that \r\nwe do here at the United Nations and based firmly on \r\nthe Charter, the rules and principles of international \r\nlaw and the relevant resolutions across the decades. \r\nOur conviction in the law, our commitment to peace \r\nand coexistence, and the international community’s \r\nlong-standing support nourish this hope and help us \r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 7/25\r\nto endure despite immense odds and hardship. The \r\nPalestinian people remain steadfast, as shall we, in \r\ngiving voice to their plight and in calling and striving \r\nevery day for their rights and justice. We are therefore \r\ndeeply grateful for the Assembly’s solidarity on a day \r\nlike this day.\r\nToday, we pay tribute to the United Nations \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People, which has for over 40 years \r\nexerted efforts in support of the inalienable rights \r\nand legitimate national aspirations of the Palestinian \r\npeople to live in freedom, peace and security in \r\ntheir homeland. These efforts fully conform with the \r\nCommittee’s General Assembly mandate, relevant \r\nresolutions, international law and the United Nations \r\npermanent responsibility towards the question of \r\nPalestine until justly resolved in all aspects. Based on \r\nthis responsibility, we again appeal to Member States to \r\nsupport the Committee in advancing its noble objectives. \r\nBearing in mind the anniversaries we shall mark in \r\n2017 and the current crossroads, we urge partnership \r\nwith the Committee to enhance the collective efforts to \r\nend the Israeli occupation and make peace.\r\nWe thank Ambassador Fodé Seck, Chair of the \r\nCommittee, for his leadership — a role graciously \r\nundertaken by Senegal over the years — and for the \r\nstatement and introduction of the resolutions under this \r\nitem that were delivered on his behalf. We also thank the \r\nRapporteur, Ambassador Carmelo Inguanez of Malta, \r\nfor presenting the annual report of the Committee \r\n(A/71/35), the other Bureau members — Afghanistan, \r\nCuba, Indonesia, Namibia and Nicaragua — and all \r\nof the Committee’s members and observers for their \r\nprincipled support. We also reiterate our appreciation to \r\nthe Division for Palestinian Rights and the Department \r\nof Public Information’s special information programme \r\non the question of Palestine for their efforts and support \r\nto the Committee.\r\nWe reiterate our thanks also to Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon for his report on the peaceful settlement \r\nof the question of Palestine (A/71/359) and recognize \r\nhis contribution over the past 10 years of his tenure \r\nto promoting peace and leading the United Nations \r\nsystem’s efforts on the question of Palestine. In this \r\nregard, we express appreciation for the support of \r\nUnder-Secretary-General for Political Affairs Jeffrey \r\nFeltman and Special Coordinator Nickolay Mladenov \r\nand their teams. We are also grateful for the tireless \r\nefforts of United Nations agencies assisting the \r\nPalestinian people, including the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast (UNRWA), with the generous support of States, \r\norganizations and partners from around the world. \r\nSuch support has helped sustain our people, including \r\n5.5 million Palestine refugees, through decades of \r\nconflict and crisis and remains vital until a just, durable \r\nsolution is achieved.\r\nWhile grateful for this support, we cannot conceal \r\nour deep disappointment and frustration at the \r\nabsence of serious efforts to uphold political and legal \r\nresponsibilities towards the question of Palestine, the \r\ncore of the Arab-Israeli conflict. As the situation further \r\ndeteriorates and peace remains far from our grasp, we \r\nlament in particular the Security Council’s failure to \r\nuphold its Charter duties and implement its resolutions. \r\nGenerations after generations of Palestinians have been \r\ndeprived of their rights and of a life of freedom, stability, \r\nprosperity and dignity. The despair and hopelessness of \r\nour youth in particular at this moment — whether in \r\noccupied Palestine or throughout the Palestine refugee \r\ncamps in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria — is a source of \r\nvast pain and worry.\r\nAs this injustice persists, constituting a bleeding \r\nwound in the Middle East, destabilizing the region, \r\nundermining peace and stability far beyond, and \r\nweakening international law and the international \r\nsystem itself, we must ask: when will the Security \r\nCouncil finally respond to the global appeals to act to \r\nheal? How can the international community continue \r\njustifying inaction and the lack of accountability as \r\nwe approach the half-century mark of Israel’s military \r\noccupation and as the international promise to the \r\nPalestinian people remains broken and they continue \r\nto be denied self-determination, the most fundamental \r\nhuman right?\r\nWhat is lacking has not been support or solidarity \r\nfor Palestine, but rather the political courage and will \r\nto respect and ensure respect for the law in the face of \r\nIsrael’s intransigence and disrespect. Resolution after \r\nresolution is being violated as Israel — the same Israel \r\ncreated by resolution 181 (II) — blatantly disregards the \r\nGeneral Assembly and the Security Council, tramples \r\ninternational law and disrespects the advisory opinion \r\nof the International Court of Justice. Dismissing calls \r\nto comply with the law, the Israeli Government instead \r\ncommits violations and crimes as if it were exempt \r\nfrom the law and as if the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nwere the exception to every norm and rule intended to \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n8/25 16-40519\r\nsafeguard human rights and peace and security. And \r\nyet, the international community fails to act.\r\nFor those taking comfort in and indulging \r\ncomplacency about the status quo — including the \r\nhistoric status quo regarding the holy sites in occupied \r\nEast Jerusalem, including Al-Haram al-Sharif — the \r\nreality is that the status quo is being severely undermined \r\nand altered every single day by the occupying Power. \r\nThis is further inflaming tensions, destabilizing the \r\nsituation, destroying the viability of the two-State \r\nsolution and obstructing peace, with far-reaching \r\nconsequences. So, again, we ask: what is the threshold \r\nfor action?\r\nReflecting on the past year alone begs this question \r\neven more insistently. As international paralysis has \r\ncontinued, Israel has persisted with its systematic, gross \r\nviolations of international law in occupied Palestine \r\nwith full impunity, destroying the prospects for peace. \r\nReport after report before the Assembly, including, \r\ninter alia, by the Secretary-General, convey a shocking \r\nreality of a vast regime of violations by the occupying \r\nPower, intensifying distress among the Palestinian \r\npopulation and their need for protection.\r\nAs reflected in recent reports, including the July \r\nreport of the Middle East Quartet, the past year has \r\nwitnessed non-stop Israeli colonization activities \r\ndeliberately aimed at altering the demography, \r\ncharacter and status of the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem. That included the \r\nexpansion and construction of settlements and the \r\nwall; unprecedented rates of home demolitions and the \r\ndestruction of civilian infrastructure and humanitarian \r\nassistance; confiscation of land; the forced displacement \r\nand transfer of Palestinians, especially vulnerable \r\nBedouin communities; the imposition of hundreds of \r\ncheckpoints, impairing freedom of movement and \r\nsocioeconomic life, including access to lands and \r\nlivelihoods; the exploitation of natural resources and \r\nobstruction of access to water and agricultural lands; \r\nand blatant annexation threats by Israeli officials.\r\nThe year has also witnessed daily Israeli military \r\nraids, causing death and injury to Palestinian children, \r\nwomen and men who have been routinely assaulted \r\nand traumatized by the occupying forces; terror and \r\nviolence on the part of extremist settlers; massive \r\nforms of collective punishment; constant intimidation \r\nand humiliation; racist, discriminatory policies and \r\nblatant dehumanization. The Palestinian people have \r\nbeen subjected to constant attempts to negate their \r\nidentity, history and heritage, including provocations \r\nand incitement against the holy sites, particularly in \r\nAl-Quds and Al-Khalil and especially at Al-Haram \r\nAl-Sharif and the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque and Al-Haram \r\nAl-Ibrahimi, and aggravation of religious sensitivities. \r\nCivilians face daily arrest and detention, foremost the \r\nyoung men, with more than 7,000 Palestinians now \r\nimprisoned or detained in Israeli jails.\r\nThose actions also include continuing Israeli \r\naggression and threats and the illegal, inhumane \r\nblockade of the Gaza Strip, where 2 million Palestinians \r\nare being mercilessly besieged and collectively \r\npunished, thereby enduring extreme deprivation and \r\nisolation for nearly 10 years, which has generated a \r\ndire humanitarian crisis and pushed socioeconomic \r\nconditions to their lowest point since 1967, with \r\npoverty, unemployment, food insecurity and despair \r\nrampant. Here I must reiterate our appeal for urgent \r\nsupport to UNRWA, which leads efforts to alleviate \r\nthe plight of the vulnerable Palestine refugees in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, particularly in Gaza, and \r\nthroughout the region, providing them with sustenance \r\nand protection amid widespread crises.\r\nAs we bear witness to the global refugee and \r\nmigrant crisis, it should be recognized that Palestinian \r\nrefugees are among the millions of civilians f leeing \r\nour region, especially due to the grave Syrian conflict. \r\nWe ask Member States not to forget those who have \r\nsuffered nearly 70 years of exile, dispossession and \r\nmisery, and urge Member States to reaffirm solidarity \r\nwith them and to support a just solution in accordance \r\nwith resolution 194 (III) of 1948, which enshrined their \r\nright to return, a right reaffirmed for all refugees in \r\nthe New York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants \r\n(resolution 71/1).\r\nAll of the facts before us confirm that the situation \r\nis far from static and that the crisis is unmanageable, \r\ncontrary to what many, including the Israeli Government, \r\nmay like to believe. The situation is in constant decline \r\nand totally unsustainable and can indeed get worse. In \r\na part of the world already experiencing much turmoil \r\nand radicalization, with spillover far beyond its borders, \r\nthat must be cause for both alarm and action.\r\nThere is international consensus that, as reflected \r\nclearly in the Quartet report, Israel’s policy of settlement \r\nconstruction and expansion is eroding the two-State \r\nsolution and entrenching a one-State reality that can \r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 9/25\r\nonly be deemed apartheid. The Quartet has called \r\nfor serious action to reverse the negative trend on the \r\nground. That must include immediate changes in Israeli \r\npolicies that are fragmenting our land, undermining our \r\nState’s viability, violating our people’s human rights \r\nand denying them their human dignity. Lip service to \r\nthe cause of peace is not enough; empty promises and \r\nclaimed commitments, contracted by every action by \r\nIsrael, must not be accepted in place of actual respect \r\nfor the law and genuine efforts for peace.\r\nThe international community — with the Security \r\nCouncil at the forefront — must consider measures to \r\nhold Israel accountable and compel compliance with \r\nits legal obligations. Steps must be taken to stop the \r\ndownward spiral and expedite an end to the illegal 50-\r\nyear occupation. Action is urgent if there is to be any \r\nhope of preserving the two-State solution based on the \r\n1967 borders and creating conditions for meaningful \r\nnegotiations on all final status issues and tangibly \r\nadvancing that solution, which, all agree, is in peril.\r\nContinued international appeasement and inaction \r\nare indefensible. Current efforts to mobilize the \r\nSecurity Council to act must be supported if we are \r\nto confront the main obstacles to peace, particularly \r\nillegal Israeli settlement activities, and forge a political \r\nhorizon in which negotiations based on the long-\r\nstanding parameters and terms of reference enshrined \r\nin the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Madrid \r\nprinciples and the Arab Peace Initiative and within a \r\nset time frame, can be accelerated for achievement of a \r\npeace agreement that will bring a complete end to the \r\nIsraeli occupation and the independence of the State of \r\nPalestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital, living side \r\nby side with the State of Israel in peace and security, \r\nand a just solution for the Palestine refugee question.\r\nThe Palestinian leadership has continually \r\nreaffirmed its commitment to peace on that basis and is \r\nready to pursue it in full cooperation with all concerned \r\nregional and international partners. We therefore \r\nreaffirm our support for France’s efforts to mobilize the \r\ninternational community for Palestinian-Israeli peace \r\nand to convene an international peace conference. We \r\nalso reaffirm our support for the efforts of the Arab \r\nStates to advance the Arab Peace Initiative, including \r\nin cooperation with the Quartet members, whose recent \r\nefforts are also fully recognized, along with the Russian \r\nand Egyptian efforts to promote dialogue and help the \r\nparties overcome the deadlock.\r\nYet none of those efforts can absolve the United \r\nNations of its responsibility. The General Assembly and \r\nSecurity Council must act to ensure that international \r\nlaw is upheld, to thread the collective efforts and \r\nchart a viable path forward. On this day — 69 years \r\nfrom the date of the partition of our homeland — I \r\nwish to remind the Assembly that, in spite of the grim \r\nrealities they are enduring, the Palestinian people and \r\nleadership are undeterred and remain insistent on the \r\npath of peace. Just a few months ago in this Hall, a \r\nPalestinian teacher, winner of the Global Teacher Prize, \r\nstood here among the United Nations Messengers of \r\nPeace proudly representing and reaffirming Palestine’s \r\nlongstanding commitment to peace. Although hopes \r\nare diminished, our people hold steadfast to the \r\njustness of their cause and still believe in the law and \r\nthe international community’s pledges to achieve peace \r\nand ensure the State of Palestine’s rightful place among \r\nthe community of nations.\r\nFrom this rostrum, we urge once more that no effort \r\nbe spared to bring the foreign occupation and tragic \r\nconflict to an end, to help the Palestinian people finally \r\nachieve their long-denied rights, their independence and \r\ndignity, and finally to establish peace and coexistence \r\nbetween the Palestinian and the Israeli peoples.\r\nMr. Danon (Israel): Every year on this date this Hall \r\nhosts the same cynical, Israel-bashing festival. Every \r\nyear we hear speaker after speaker distorting history \r\nand promoting a completely one-sided narrative. Every \r\nyear Member States adopt the same empty resolutions. \r\nThis year is no different. Let no one be fooled: none of \r\nit does anything to help the Palestinian people. It only \r\ncontinues to fuel the Palestinian culture of victimhood.\r\nThe reality is that this debate on the so-called \r\nquestion of Palestine avoids the hard questions. Are \r\nthe Palestinians really ready to make the hard decisions \r\nthat are needed for peace? Do they really want to end \r\nthe conflict, to end the decades of terror and violence \r\nagainst the people of Israel and to end their diplomatic \r\nwarfare here at the United Nations? For all the talk \r\nabout new initiatives and new resolutions, we must ask \r\nthe question: do the Palestinians even want a State? \r\nHistory tells us that the answer is no.\r\nSince 1947, the Palestinian leadership has proved \r\ntime and time again that they do not want a solution for \r\ntheir people. Let us remember what happened 69 years \r\nago. The United Nations voted to partition the land into \r\na Jewish State and an Arab State. We all know what \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n10/25 16-40519\r\nhappened next. The Jews said yes, the Arabs said no. \r\nIt is as simple as that. And today nothing has changed. \r\nAfter 69 years, the Palestinians still do not want peace. \r\nThey still do not want a State, and they still do not want \r\nto end the conflict. Every time that there is a possibility \r\nof progress, an opportunity to choose a better path for \r\ntheir people, they choose the path of violence, rejection, \r\nand bloodshed.\r\nLet us not forget that the leaders of the Zionist \r\nmovement accepted the United Nations plan, despite all \r\nthe risks and the loud threats of genocide against the \r\nJewish people by Arab leaders. The brave Zionist leaders \r\naccepted the plan because they knew that it offered the \r\nbest hope for the restoration of Jewish independence \r\nafter 2,000 years and because they believed it was \r\npossible to live side by side with their Arab neighbours \r\nin the land of their forefathers. However, the Arab \r\nleadership was not willing to accept the Jewish State \r\nunder any conditions. Let us make no mistake: it was \r\nnot about pushing for a better deal.\r\nA working paper of the Secretariat of the United \r\nNations dated 30 July 1949 stated clearly, “The \r\nArabs rejected the United Nations Partition Plan ... \r\nin its entirety.” Their goal was clear. It was not about \r\nestablishing another Arab State. It was, and remains, \r\nabout the opposition to a homeland for the Jewish \r\npeople. Let us look at the headlines on the day after \r\nthe vote: “Assembly votes Palestine Partition, Arabs \r\nwalk out”, “Disavow any partition role”. That is the \r\nwhole story.\r\nThey rejected the plan and launched a war of \r\ndestruction, which was joined by the armies of five \r\nArab nations. Their response was best summed up by \r\nSecretary-General of the League of Arab States Azzam \r\nPasha. He promised:\r\n“It will be a war of elimination. It will be a \r\nmomentous massacre in history that will be \r\ntalked about like the massacres of the Mongols or \r\nthe Crusades.”\r\nThat has repeated itself at every stage of history. \r\nIsrael makes compromises for peace. The Palestinians \r\nreject every offer and every plan, and respond with \r\na wave of violence and terror. From 1948 to 1967, \r\nwhen the territory under discussion was under Arab \r\ncontrol, the residents did not go to international forums \r\ndemanding a State, and the Arab States did not lift a \r\nfinger to create one.\r\nThe founding charter of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization does not call for a Palestinian State. It \r\ncalls on Arabs “to repulse the Zionist invasion and to \r\neliminate the Zionist presence from Palestine”. Let me \r\nread that again: “to repulse the Zionist invasion and to \r\neliminate the Zionist presence from Palestine”.\r\nIn 1967, Israel was attacked again from three sides \r\nbut managed to defeat three Arab armies. Again, we \r\nextended our hand to our neighbours, appealing to them \r\nto end the conflict, to end the bloodshed and to end \r\nthe suffering on both sides once and for all. The Arab \r\nWorld responded with one unequivocal message of \r\nrejection: “No peace, no recognition, no negotiation”.\r\nThe history of Palestinian rejectionism is alive and \r\nwell today. In the year 2000, Israel’s Prime Minister \r\nEhud Barak made an unprecedented and far-reaching \r\noffer for the establishment of a Palestinian State. \r\nBelieve me when I say that that was very controversial \r\nin Israel. It involved very painful compromises on our \r\npart. But still, the Palestinian leadership, led by Yasser \r\nArafat, said no. President Clinton urged him to change \r\nhis mind. Many Arab leaders told him that it was the \r\ngolden opportunity to establish a State. But he refused. \r\nNot only did he say no, but he encouraged the wave of \r\nterror and violence that has still not ended.\r\nPresident Clinton called the decision to reject a \r\nState “an error of historic proportions”. However, the \r\nPalestinians repeated their mistake eight years later. \r\nOnce again, an Israeli leader, Prime Minister Ehud \r\nOlmert, offered the Palestinians everything they \r\nclaimed to want — a State of their own, virtually all the \r\nterritory in dispute and the uprooting of the so-called \r\nsettlements. What was their response? President Abbas \r\nsaid, “I did not agree ... I rejected it out of hand”.\r\nHow many times should we be shocked when \r\nthe Palestinians will not even consider the most \r\ngenerous offers? How many times do we have to hear \r\nno, until we finally believe it? Every time there was an \r\nopportunity to move forward, to chart a path to a better \r\nfuture, the Palestinian leadership rejected it.\r\nIsrael has tried everything. In 2005, we dismantled \r\nentire communities and uprooted thousands of people \r\nfrom their homes in the Gaza Strip, and from parts \r\nof Judea and Samaria as well. It was a chance for the \r\nPalestinians to prove that their goal was the welfare \r\nof their people rather than warfare with Israel. It was \r\nan opportunity for the Palestinian leadership, and they \r\nthrew it away.\r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 11/25\r\nInstead of building hospitals and schools in Gaza, \r\ninstead of investing in the future of their people, Gaza \r\nbecame a launching pad for attacking Israeli towns \r\nand cities with rockets from above and tunnels from \r\nbelow. Once again, Israel opened the door to peace, \r\nand the Palestinians slammed it shut. To this day, the \r\nPalestinians refuse to assume control over the Gaza \r\nborder crossings. The Palestinian leadership will not \r\neven take responsibility for the territory and the people \r\nwhom they claim to represent, because responsibility \r\nrequires accountability. It requires a practical policy of \r\naction. It means rejecting excuses.\r\nBut making excuses is the Palestinian policy. Just \r\nthink about one of the great lies that, unfortunately, \r\nmany in this Hall repeat endlessly. Time and time \r\nagain we hear that settlements are the obstacle to \r\nprogress. But in 2010, for 10 months, we put a complete \r\nfreeze on settlement-building as a goodwill gesture to \r\nadvance talks. For 10 months, not a single apartment, \r\nkindergarten or community centre was built in Judea \r\nor Samaria. That is a fact. And the Palestinians still \r\nrefused to even come to the table. That is also a fact. \r\nIt is not about the settlements. It never was. The \r\nPalestinian rejection began before there was a single \r\nsettlement, and it will continue despite every effort to \r\nmove forward.\r\nIn 2014, United States Secretary of State John Kerry \r\nled another round of talks. The Government of Israel \r\nmade significant concessions and got nothing in return \r\nfrom the Palestinians. We made difficult decisions and \r\neven released Palestinian prisoners who had murdered \r\ninnocent Israelis. Just think about it. Just imagine the \r\npain felt by Israelis when they watched those terrorists \r\nreceive a hero’s welcome from President Abbas.\r\nBut then, just as the deadline was about pass, \r\nthe Palestinian Authority blew up the process by \r\nestablishing a unity Government with Hamas — an \r\ninternationally recognized terror organization. The \r\nPalestinian Authority faced an important decision: \r\nwhether to talk peace with Israel or to join forces with \r\na terror organization, and they chose terror — another \r\nmissed opportunity, another rejection, another embrace \r\nof the forces of violence.\r\nIsrael has tried everything, time after time — more \r\ncompromises and more concessions. But the Palestinians \r\nhave always had an excuse. There was always something \r\nmissing, always some reason not to sit down and talk \r\nwith us. If the Palestinians really want peace, why do \r\nthey reject every opportunity? If they really wanted \r\npeace, they would have responded to Prime Minister \r\nBarak and Prime Minister Olmert’s far-reaching \r\nproposals. And right now, today, they can answer \r\nPrime Minister Netanyahu’s call for negotiations, at \r\nany time, in any place — in New York, in Jerusalem, in \r\nRamallah. Instead, they focus their time and effort on \r\nthe political theatre that we are witnessing here today. \r\nWe hear empty resolutions and empty speeches, more \r\npromises of support, more new initiatives, more United \r\nNations organizations and, of course, more funding. \r\nThe Palestinian Authority pays lip service to those \r\ninitiatives because it pays well.\r\nAccording to the World Bank, they received \r\n$2.5 billion in international aid in 2014, and $21.7 billion \r\nin development aid since the Oslo Accords were signed \r\nin 1993. According to the 2016 Global Humanitarian \r\nAssistance Report, the Palestinians have been among \r\nthe top 10 recipients of international funding for over a \r\ndecade. And they receive 10 times more humanitarian \r\naid per capita than any other people. Year after year, \r\nthe international community pours billions of dollars \r\ninto the Palestinian Authority — an organization that \r\nis corrupt from top to bottom. Can we be surprised \r\nwhen the money intended to improve the lives of the \r\nPalestinian people goes instead to the families and the \r\ninner circles of the Palestinian leaders?\r\nBut it is not just about widespread corruption. \r\nThe Palestinians leadership allocates tens of millions \r\nof dollars to finance the Palestinian terror industry. \r\nIn 2012, the Palestinian Authority paid more than \r\n$75 million to terrorists in Israeli prisons, and \r\n$78 million to the families of terrorists, including \r\nsuicide bombers. Together that accounts for more than \r\n16 per cent of annual foreign donations and grants to \r\nthe Palestinian Authority budget. They tried to hide \r\nthat subsidizing of terror by shifting responsibility to \r\nthe Palestine Liberation Organization, but the money \r\nall comes from the same source and has the same \r\npurpose — to encourage the murder of innocent Jews. \r\nTaxpayers around the world should know that their \r\nmoney is helping to fund stabbings, shootings and \r\nsuicide bombings.\r\nThat is where the funding goes — not to building \r\ninstitutions, but to paying Palestinian Authority \r\nsalaries, to the black hole of Palestinian Authority \r\ncorruption and to paychecks for terrorists. The \r\nPalestinians are on permanent welfare provided by the \r\ninternational community, and they have no intention of \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n12/25 16-40519\r\nstopping it. They want the conflict to continue because \r\nthey know that others will continue to pay their bills, \r\nand institutions like this one will continue to conduct a \r\ncampaign against Israel on their behalf. The Palestinians \r\ndo not want an agreement. They do not want a State. The \r\nresponsibilities of statehood would mean making hard \r\nchoices and delivering on the promises to their people. \r\nIt would mean investing in their own institutions. It \r\nwould mean putting an end to terror and incitement. \r\nIt would mean finally recognizing the connection of \r\nthe Jewish people to the land of Israel. It would mean \r\nmaking peace. But the Palestinians want easy victories \r\nwithout the responsibilities of governing. And they \r\nknow that the only way to do that is to perpetuate \r\nthe conflict.\r\nIt is time to put an end to that lie once and for all. \r\nIf the Palestinians really wanted peace, we could have \r\nhad peace. The real goal of the Palestinian Authority \r\nis to continue to exist as a corrupt entity, living off \r\nthe goodwill of the international community. For 69 \r\nyears, the Palestinians have rejected every offer, every \r\ncompromise and every chance for peace. But the more \r\nthe Palestinians say no, the more the international \r\ncommunity says yes.\r\nIf you really want to show solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people, then end this charade. Shut down \r\nthe grievance industry and the culture of victimhood. \r\nStop the endless stream of resolutions that do nothing \r\nto promote peace or help the Palestinian people. And, \r\nmost important, condemn the culture of hate and \r\nincitement and demand that the Palestinian leaders \r\nfinally return to the negotiating table. Until that time, \r\nIsrael will continue to stand strong in defence of its \r\ncountry, and the people of Israel will continue to pray \r\nfor a true and lasting peace.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the observer \r\nof the European Union.\r\nMr. Vale de Almeida (European Union): I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU). The candidate countries of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia \r\nand Albania; the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina; and the European Free Trade Association \r\ncountries Iceland and Liechtenstein, members of the \r\nEuropean Economic Area; as well as Ukraine, align \r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nThe European Union is gravely concerned about \r\nthe trends on the ground that threaten the viability of \r\na two-State solution. In the past few months, we have \r\nseen an acceleration of negative trends that directly \r\ncontradict the Quartet’s recommendations. There is a \r\ndanger that a one-State reality will become entrenched \r\nin a perpetual occupation and conflict, which would \r\nbe incompatible with the realization of the national \r\naspirations of both peoples.\r\nThe European Union has a clear position, set out \r\nin our Council’s conclusions, on pursuing a two-State \r\nsolution. It is the same two-State solution that has been \r\nidentified as the objective of all Israeli Governments, the \r\nPalestinian leadership and the international community \r\nsince Oslo — a negotiated two-State solution that \r\nmeets Israeli and Palestinian security needs and \r\nPalestinian aspirations to statehood and sovereignty; \r\nends the occupation that began in 1967; and resolves \r\nall permanent status issues in order to end the conflict. \r\nTo us, our position is clear and objective, and it is not \r\njust ours but one that we share with the rest of the \r\ninternational community and the parties concerned.\r\nThe European Union is extremely concerned about \r\nthe escalation in violence and tensions in Israel and \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territory. We unequivocally \r\ncondemn all acts of terror and incitement as \r\nunacceptable and unjustifiable. We insist that all \r\nperpetrators of crimes or acts of terror, whether against \r\nIsraelis or Palestinians, must be brought to justice. The \r\nresponse of security forces must be proportionate and \r\nconsistent, regardless of the perpetrators. Israel must \r\nconduct thorough investigations into cases where lethal \r\nforce has been used. Alleged violations and abuses \r\nof international human rights law and international \r\nhumanitarian law by all sides must be investigated in \r\naccordance with international laws and standards. The \r\ncompliance of States and non-State actors alike with \r\ninternational humanitarian and human rights law, as \r\nwell as their accountability, is a cornerstone of peace \r\nand security in the region.\r\nWe are also concerned about the recurring tensions \r\nat holy sites. Jerusalem is a city sacred to three religions. \r\nWe reiterate our call for maintaining the status quo put \r\nin place in 1967, in line with previous understandings \r\nand bearing in mind Jordan’s special role. Any change \r\nin the status quo would be deeply destabilizing. The \r\nmember States of the European Union have never \r\nrecognized the annexation of the territories occupied \r\nin 1967, including East Jerusalem. All discriminatory \r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 13/25\r\ntreatment of Palestinians in East Jerusalem must stop, \r\nand a way must be found through negotiations to \r\nresolve the status of Jerusalem as the future capital of \r\ntwo States.\r\nI now turn to the issue of settlements and recall the \r\nEuropean Union’s long-held position on that issue, which \r\nis that the settlements are illegal under international \r\nlaw, constitute an obstacle to peace and threaten to \r\nmake a two-State solution impossible. Beginning \r\nearly this year, and in particular since the publication \r\nof the Quartet report (see S/2016/595), Israel’s \r\nsettlement expansion has accelerated steadily and \r\nsystematically, which goes directly against the report’s \r\nrecommendations. Other related policies are having \r\na negative impact on the socioeconomic development \r\nof Area C, which is crucial to the viability of a future \r\nPalestinian State. This year, Israel’s demolitions of \r\nPalestinian structures in Area C, some of which were \r\nfunded by the European Union and its member States, \r\nhave vastly increased, leading to evictions and forced \r\ntransfers, including evictions of Bedouin communities. \r\nWe are particularly concerned about measures that may \r\namount to collective punishment, such as punitive home \r\ndemolitions, the sealing off of Palestinian villages and \r\nthe withdrawal of work permits. In that regard, we would \r\nlike to recall once again the applicability of international \r\nhumanitarian law in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nincluding the parts of the Fourth Geneva Convention \r\nthat relate to the protection of civilians.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nreaffirm their commitment to ensuring the continued, \r\nfull and effective implementation of existing EU \r\nlegislation and bilateral arrangements applicable to \r\nsettlement products. We are also committed to ensuring \r\nthat, in line with international law, all agreements \r\nbetween the State of Israel and the European Union \r\nmust unequivocally and explicitly indicate that they \r\ndo not apply to the territories occupied by Israel in \r\n1967. Settlement activity in East Jerusalem seriously \r\njeopardizes the possibility of Jerusalem serving as the \r\nfuture capital of both States. The EU is also alarmed \r\nby the progress being made in the Knesset by a bill \r\non settlement regularization, which would enable the \r\nex post facto legalization of Israeli outposts in the \r\noccupied West Bank and the de-facto confiscation of \r\nprivate Palestinian land. The new legislation would \r\nenable a dramatic expansion of Israeli settlements, \r\nand thereby critically endanger the contiguity of a \r\nfuture Palestinian State and the prospects for a two-\r\nState solution.\r\nMilitant activity and the dire humanitarian situation \r\nin Gaza fuel general instability and are a recipe for \r\nrenewed conflict. Fundamental improvements in \r\nliving conditions are needed, particularly for the \r\nmost vulnerable, especially children and the elderly. \r\nWhile all international donors should swiftly honour \r\ntheir pledges made at the Cairo Conference, Gaza’s \r\nhumanitarian needs can be properly addressed only \r\nthrough political progress on the following three tracks.\r\nFirst, all sides must respect the ceasefire. All \r\nindiscriminate attacks are illegal and unacceptable and \r\nincrease the risks of escalation. The illicit arms build-\r\nup by Hamas and other militant groups must stop. \r\nWe urge all parties to work towards the de-escalation \r\nof tensions.\r\nSecondly, the European Union urges all Palestinian \r\nfactions to engage in good faith in the reconciliation \r\nprocess on the basis of the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization platform and the Quartet principles. A \r\nsingle, legitimate and democratic Palestinian Authority, \r\nwith full control over Gaza, is critical for fulfilling the \r\nnational aspirations of the Palestinian people and for \r\nachieving a viable Palestinian State. In that context, \r\nthe European Union encourages the prompt setting of \r\na new date for the planned Palestinian local elections, \r\nwhich, if held in line with international standards, \r\ncould become an important step towards strengthened \r\nPalestinian democracy and towards national unity.\r\nThirdly, we reiterate our call on Israel for an end \r\nto the Gaza closure and a full opening of the crossings, \r\nwhile addressing its legitimate security concerns. \r\nThe lifting of the restrictions on the movement of \r\npeople, including representatives of the international \r\ncommunity, and on the movement of services and \r\ngoods, particularly those designated as dual-use items, \r\nis needed so as to allow reconstruction, service delivery \r\nand international infrastructure projects.\r\nMs. Young (Belize), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, the adoption in September of the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian electricity agreement was a welcome \r\ndevelopment. The European Union urges both parties \r\nto promote trust and confidence-building measures.\r\nMr. Salam (Lebanon): In June, Israel’s occupation \r\nof the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will mark its \r\nfiftieth anniversary. We believe that it is high time for \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n14/25 16-40519\r\nus all to pause and thoroughly reflect on what has been \r\nthe outcome of that occupation, on our failure to put an \r\nend to it and on what ought to be done to live up to our \r\nobligations under the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nso as to allow the Palestinian people to exercise their \r\ninalienable right to self-determination.\r\nFirst, one cannot but be struck by the ongoing \r\nsystematic and deliberate expansion of Israeli \r\nsettlements in the occupied West Bank, particularly in \r\nand around East Jerusalem, since 1967. As a matter of \r\nfact, in the past 50 years the Israeli Government has \r\nestablished 131 settlements in the West Bank, excluding \r\nEast Jerusalem. In total, there are now nearly 800,000 \r\nIsraeli settlers on Palestinian lands, more than 400,000 \r\nin the West Bank and more than 350,000 in East \r\nJerusalem. It is worth noting that the number of settlers \r\nhas tripled since the peace process began, and it is now \r\nestimated that the number could reach 1 million by the \r\nend of the decade, according to the Applied Research \r\nInstitute-Jerusalem.\r\nIt is hardly necessary to remind the Assembly \r\nthat all of those settlements are in f lagrant violation \r\nof international law. Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention explicitly prohibits an occupying Power \r\nfrom transferring any part of its own civilian population \r\ninto the territory that it occupies. Moreover, article \r\n8 of the Rome Statute of the International Criminal \r\nCourt defines such acts as war crimes. Numerous \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, including resolutions 446 \r\n(1979), 452 (1979) and 465 (1980), have stressed that \r\nthose settlements are illegal and constitute a serious \r\nobstruction to peace. Of course, Israel attempts to \r\nlegalize the so-called outposts, that is, the settlements \r\nthat have been established since the 1990s without \r\nGovernment approval and which are considered illegal \r\naccording to Israeli law and which are also all in blatant \r\nbreach of international law. The number of such so-\r\ncalled outposts, excluding East Jerusalem, has reached \r\n97, and their locations appear as strategic front lines \r\nmaking it possible to expand the settlement areas of \r\ncontrol. Therefore, we note the very serious danger that \r\nthey represent.\r\nTurning now to East Jerusalem, we need to note \r\nthat, since it was illegally annexed in 1967, Israel’s \r\nprimary goal has been to create a de facto demographic \r\nand geographic situation in order to frustrate any \r\nfuture attempts to challenge alleged Israeli sovereignty \r\nover the city. In order to achieve that goal, the Israeli \r\nGovernment has been seeking to alter the historical \r\nidentity of many landmarks and quarters of the city, \r\nalong with taking actions to increase the number of Jews \r\nand reduce the number of Palestinians living in the city, \r\nsuch as by imposing broad restrictions on construction \r\ninside Palestinian neighbourhoods, yet allowing Jewish \r\nsettlers to move into the heart of those neighbourhoods \r\nand live there while expelling Palestinians from their \r\nhomes and demolishing them.\r\nIn June 2002, the Israeli Government began to \r\nconstruct a wall to encircle the West Bank. Once \r\ncompleted, the length of that wall is projected to be \r\nmore than twice the length of Israel’s border with the \r\nWest Bank, as it snakes deep inside the West Bank to \r\nencompass many Israeli settlements on the western \r\nside. In fact, 85 per cent of the wall runs inside the West \r\nBank, including East Jerusalem, rather than along the \r\nGreen Line.\r\nThe advisory opinion of the International Court of \r\nJustice — Legal consequences of the construction of \r\na wall in the occupied Palestinian territory — issued \r\non 9 July 2004, states that the construction of the wall \r\nwas “an attempt to annex the territory contrary to \r\ninternational law” and that\r\n“[t]he de facto annexation of land interferes with \r\nthe territorial sovereignty and consequently with \r\nthe rights of Palestinians to self-determination.” \r\n(A/ES-10/273, para. 115)\r\nWhen finished, the wall and the Israeli settlements, \r\nIsraeli-only highways, closed military zones and so-\r\ncalled nature reserves are projected to cover 46 per cent \r\nof the occupied West Bank, effectively annexing them \r\nto Israel.\r\nThe 50 years of Israeli occupation have also \r\nwitnessed numerous other illegal policies and human \r\nrights violations, including, inter alia, the demolition \r\nof Palestinian homes and other civilian structures, \r\nthe confiscation of Palestinian land and the forced \r\neviction and displacement of Palestinian families, the \r\ndiscriminatory allocation of water and restrictions on \r\naccess to land and natural resources and on movement.\r\nWith regard to those policies and violations, the \r\nfacts and figures speak for themselves. According to \r\nthe Israeli Committee Against House Demolitions, \r\n48,488 Palestinian homes and civilian structures have \r\nbeen demolished by Israel since 1967, either as a form \r\nof punitive measure or as collateral damage in military \r\nincursions, such as in the attacks on Gaza, and also \r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 15/25\r\nas a result of the fact that Israel has refused to grant \r\nbuilding permits to Palestinians, who are then forced \r\nto build illegally on their own land and face demolition.\r\nSince 1967, Israeli authorities have confiscated \r\n1,018,127 dunums of land, which represents 20 per cent \r\nof the area of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. \r\nIn that regard, it is worth noting that, on 15 April 2015, \r\nthe Supreme Court of Israel reaffirmed the application \r\nof the Absentees’ Property Law, which allows for the \r\ncontinued confiscation of property in East Jerusalem \r\nwhen its owners reside in other parts of the West Bank \r\nor in Gaza.\r\nMost of Palestine’s natural resources are located in \r\nArea C, which constitutes over 60 per cent of the West \r\nBank. According to the World Bank, if Palestinians \r\nwere able to freely and fully exploit their natural \r\nresources in that area, they would boost their economy \r\nby an estimated $3.4 billion annually. Maybe then the \r\nPalestinian Authority would no longer need to rely on \r\ndevelopment or humanitarian aid.\r\nAs for water, Israel controls 100 per cent of the \r\nJordan River basin and 80 per cent of water reserves \r\nin the West Bank — accounting for over 25 per cent \r\nof its water consumption. Since it laid its hands on the \r\nwater resources of the West Bank in 1967, thousands of \r\nPalestinians have been prevented from developing their \r\nwater infrastructure and have become dependent upon \r\nIsrael for water. It is very telling to note that while on \r\naverage each Israeli settler in the West Bank has access \r\nto 240-300 litres of water per day, Palestinians in the \r\nWest Bank have access to only 73 litres.\r\nMovement is restricted in the West Bank by \r\nalmost 600 permanent checkpoints, roadblocks \r\nand earth mounds, let alone the hundreds of f lying \r\ncheckpoints — not to mention the bypass road \r\nnetwork, defined by the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs as\r\n“a network of roads that are primarily for Israeli \r\nuse and which connect Israeli settlements and other \r\ninfrastructure to each other and to Israel. Palestinian \r\nvehicular access into these roads is either restricted \r\nor prevented and ultimately diverted. Consequently, \r\nthese roads have become barriers.”\r\nNo wonder some non-governmental organizations have \r\nqualified those roads as “apartheid roads”. We also note \r\nthat approximately 41,000 acres of Palestinian land \r\nhave been confiscated in order to sustain that network \r\nof 1,661 kilometres of apartheid roads.\r\nSince 1967, an estimated 750,000 Palestinians — up \r\nto 20 per cent of the Palestinian population — have \r\nat some point been detained by Israeli authorities, \r\nincluding over 95,000 children, of whom 59,000 are \r\nlikely to have been subjected to some form of physical \r\nviolence. Acts of terrorism and violence by Israeli \r\nsettlers, including harassment and intimidation against \r\nPalestinian civilians, have also escalated in recent \r\nyears. However, impunity prevails when it comes to \r\nsuch acts, as only 1.9 per cent of complaints submitted \r\nby Palestinians with regard to settlers’ attacks have \r\nresulted in any form of conviction.\r\nWe must now admit that our condemnations of all \r\nthose illegal acts for 50 years in the Assembly, even \r\nwhen expressed in the strongest terms, have all failed \r\nto put an end to the continued Israeli occupation of the \r\nState of Palestine. It is high time that the United Nations \r\nmove beyond mere condemnations in the Assembly. The \r\nSecurity Council should shoulder its responsibilities by \r\nenforcing its own resolutions relating to the illegality \r\nof the settlement activities and by calling for concrete \r\nmeasures to put end to the occupation of the State of \r\nPalestine, according to a clear and binding time frame.\r\nTo turn that into a reality, I would like to ask \r\neveryone to reflect on the following words of great \r\nwisdom, uttered by a great man, Bishop Desmond Tutu:\r\n“If apartheid ended, so can the occupation, but the \r\nmoral force and international pressure will have to \r\nbe just as determined.”\r\nMr. Alotaibi (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): Our \r\ndebate on the Palestinian question, which is the \r\ncore of the Arab-Israeli conflict, coincides with the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights of \r\nthe Palestinian People’s celebration of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People. I welcome \r\nthe work of the Committee to proclaim 2017 as the \r\n“International Year to End the Israeli Occupation” in \r\nthe Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem.\r\nI also wish to thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon \r\nfor his report (A/71/359) on this agenda item, entitled \r\n“Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine”, \r\nwhich sheds light on the suffering of the Palestinian \r\npeople in the occupied territories owing to the f lagrant \r\nand gross violations of international humanitarian law, \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n16/25 16-40519\r\ninternational law and human rights, and other practices \r\nby the occupying Power.\r\nToday’s report describes a regrettable humanitarian \r\nsituation in the occupied territories, which should \r\nprompt us to act swiftly to help the Palestinian people, \r\nwho are victims of the occupation, injustice and the \r\nbelligerent policies of Israeli authorities attempting to \r\nchange the demographic and geographic composition of \r\nthe Palestinian territories through forced displacements, \r\nthe confiscation of land and property and the f louting of \r\ninternational customs, including attacks on the sanctity \r\nof tombs.\r\nKuwait supports the efforts of the international \r\ncommunity to reach a lasting and comprehensive solution \r\nto the Palestinian question based on the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, international law and the relevant resolutions \r\nof international legality. We welcome France’s initiative \r\nto convene an international peace conference that would \r\nlead to an international multilateral mechanism to \r\neliminate the illegal settlements and Israel’s occupation \r\nof Palestinian land, in the framework of the right of \r\nPalestinians to self-determination, thereby making \r\nit possible for the Palestinian people to establish an \r\nindependent State with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nwithin the pre-1967 boundaries.\r\nWe must understand that the practices and policies \r\nimposed upon the defenceless Palestinians by the \r\nIsraeli authorities in the occupied territories are illegal, \r\nas are the blockade on the Gaza Strip, which has been \r\nin force since 2007, the restrictions that prevent the \r\nfree f low of persons and goods, and the confiscation \r\nof land. Those are all policies aimed at undermining a \r\ntwo-State solution and at entrenching the occupation.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to recall the State of \r\nKuwait’s principled position. The question of Palestine \r\nhas always been a priority item at the United Nations, \r\nas it ref lects the cause of a people who have suffered for \r\ndecades from the occupation and have been deprived of \r\ntheir most fundamental rights, their dignity and their \r\nfreedom. We pay tribute to the Palestinian people’s \r\nstoicism and their struggle to secure their legitimate \r\npolitical rights, in particular the establishment of \r\nan independent State on their territory with East \r\nJerusalem as their capital. We are in favour of setting \r\na deadline for ending the Israeli occupation in the \r\nPalestinian territories.\r\nSecondly, we condemn the continuation of the \r\ninhumane and illegal blockade imposed on the Gaza \r\nStrip, which is a violation, among so many others \r\nby Israel, of the relevant resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil, in particular Security Council resolution 1860 \r\n(2009) and Israel’s obligations under the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention of 1949. We call for the immediate end of \r\nthe blockade.\r\nThirdly, we call for the freeing of imprisoned \r\nand detained Palestinians and the setting up of an \r\ninternational commission to establish the facts and \r\nconduct investigations on the situation in Israeli \r\nprisons in order to verify that Israel is respecting \r\ninternational law.\r\nFourthly, we are in favour of Palestine’s request for \r\nfull membership in the United Nations, as a step that \r\nwould promote a lasting and comprehensive settlement \r\nof the Israeli-Palestine conflict. We also support \r\nPalestine’s determination to accede to international \r\norganizations and conventions, as is its right.\r\nFifthly, we call on the international community, \r\nin particular on the Security Council, to provide \r\ninternational protection to the Palestinian people, who \r\nare defenceless against the Israeli war machine.\r\nSixthly, we call on all parties, especially those \r\nthat sponsor the peace process in the Middle East, to \r\ncontinue the efforts that have been agreed on and to \r\nensure that Israel abides by the norms of international \r\nlaw. In that context, we recall the responsibility that \r\nthe United Nations and its bodies shoulder with regard \r\nto the Palestinian cause, including the equitable and \r\ncomprehensive settlement of all relevant issues, in \r\nparticular that of Palestinian refugees.\r\nIn conclusion, we urgently call on the Security \r\nCouncil to assume its responsibility, uphold its \r\nresolutions, hold Israel to its obligation to end its \r\nf lagrant violations of international humanitarian law \r\nin the occupied territories and implement the relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, in particular Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 (2002) \r\nand 1515 (2003), so as to achieve a just and lasting \r\npeace in the Middle East.\r\nMs. Bahous (Jordan) (spoke in Arabic): I thank the \r\nChair and members of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People for their \r\nimportant role and their ongoing work over the years \r\nin drawing international attention to the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people and their cause, while highlighting \r\nthe injustice and suffering that they face.\r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 17/25\r\nEvery year, we gather here in this Hall to draw the \r\nattention of the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to the question of Palestine as we renew \r\nour commitment of continued support to ensure that the \r\nPalestinian people are able to exercise their inalienable \r\nrights, in particular their right to self-determination \r\nand the return of Palestinian displaced persons and \r\nrefugees to their territory and property. Despite the \r\nimportance of today’s meeting, we are nevertheless \r\npreoccupied by the poignant situation on the ground \r\nand Israel’s violation of the rights of Palestinians in the \r\nPalestinian occupied territories. I believe that requires \r\nsomething more substantial than celebrating a Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. Rather, concrete \r\nmeasures should be taken to end the Israeli occupation \r\nand stop ongoing violations that threaten the viability \r\nof a two-State solution and undermine any possibility \r\nof achieving a lasting and comprehensive peace in the \r\nregion. Settlement activities pose one of the major \r\nrisks to such a peace that must be addressed, not to \r\nspeak of the demolitions of homes, the displacement of \r\nPalestinians and the raids on holy sites. That is not only \r\na red line for Palestinians and Jordan, but a set of issues \r\nthat impedes a two-State solution.\r\nI would like to renew our unconditional commitment \r\nto continue our legal and historical right to provide \r\nprotection to the Al-Aqsa Mosque and the Al-Haram \r\nAl-Sharif in coordination with our brothers in the State \r\nof Palestine on the basis of the historic Hashemite \r\ncustodianship carried out by His Majesty Abdullah II \r\nbin Al-Hussein over Islamic and Christian holy sites \r\nin Al-Quds, and of Jordan’s right to provide them with \r\nprotection. We must stress the importance of today’s \r\nmeeting, because it confers political importance to \r\neffectively reaching a peaceful solution with regard to \r\nthe Palestinian cause. That is especially relevant given \r\nthat the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is at the heart of \r\ntensions in the region and requires a lasting, just and \r\ncomprehensive peace based on a two-State solution, \r\nas well as on international resolutions and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative.\r\nDespite the increasing international support for the \r\nPalestinian cause, Israel continues to ignore and remain \r\nindifferent to the determination of the international \r\ncommunity to end the settlement activities, lift the \r\nblockade on the Gaza Strip and halt daily violations of \r\nPalestinians’ rights. Owing to the current stalemate, \r\nwe must redouble efforts and consider new proposals \r\nto ensure that Israel ends its occupation of Palestinian \r\nterritories. That is the only path that will lead to \r\nIsrael’s security and acceptance in the region. In that \r\ncontext, Jordan supports concrete international efforts, \r\nincluding measures aimed at building trust between \r\nthe Palestinian and Israeli parties and a peaceful \r\nenvironment conducive to resuming substantive \r\nnegotiations with the goal of achieving peace for \r\nboth peoples.\r\nWe reaffirm the importance of providing protection \r\nto the Palestinian people, and we endorse the proposal \r\nthat 2017 should be declared as the International Year to \r\nEnd Israeli Occupation. We reiterate the importance of \r\nPalestinian unity and reconciliation among the various \r\nPalestinian factions, which would eventually fulfil the \r\nrequirements voiced by the international community, \r\nenabling independence and a viable future Palestinian \r\nState within the pre-1967 borders with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital.\r\nThe Palestinian cause does not mean only \r\nestablishing a Palestinian State or ending the \r\nsettlements. In fact, the destiny of an entire people is \r\nat the heart of the Palestinian question. We have to \r\nspeak about their value and dignity as human beings, \r\nwhich deserve to be upheld. Jordan believes that the \r\nusurped rights of Palestinians must be recognized and \r\nrestored to their legal owners. Every year we make \r\nfurther efforts in the various international forums to \r\nrestore the rights of the Palestinian people and to put \r\nan end to their suffering. There is no denying the fact \r\nthat the absence of justice, the ongoing occupation and \r\noppression of the Palestinian people and the deprivation \r\nof their legal rights are some of the main causes of the \r\nspread of extremist ideologies that lead to terrorism.\r\nOur support for the Palestinian people will not \r\nstop short on this International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. The defence of their rights is \r\nat the heart of our regional and international efforts at \r\nall levels. Our solidarity with the Palestinian people, \r\nas we draw the attention of the world to their suffering \r\nand oppression, is not limited to those people who \r\nhave remained in place. Attention must also focus on \r\nthe millions who were forced from their homes and \r\ndisplaced from their lands and who became refugees \r\nor were displaced for decades. With that in mind, the \r\ninternational community must assume its responsibility \r\nand its ethical and humanitarian duty by ending the \r\nsuffering of the Palestinians and ensuring their right of \r\nreturn and their entitlement to reparation, and by ending \r\nthe Israeli violations and breaches of international law \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n18/25 16-40519\r\nand inducing Israel to implement the relevant United \r\nNations resolutions.\r\nMr. Lal (India) I thank the President for convening \r\nthis important discussion on the question of Palestine \r\nas we mark the International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People.\r\nMay I draw attention to the message from the \r\nPrime Minister of India, Mr. Narendra Modi, which \r\nhe issued on this important occasion. In his message, \r\nPrime Minister Modi reaffirms India’s support for the \r\ncause of Palestine and its solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople in their struggle for a sovereign, independent, \r\nviable and united State of Palestine living within secure \r\nand recognized borders, side by side and at peace with \r\nIsrael and with East Jerusalem as its capital. He stated \r\nthat India will continue to support the development \r\nand nation-building efforts of Palestine by extending \r\ntechnical and financial assistance. India has been \r\nactively helping Palestine in its reconstruction process \r\nthrough various kinds of project assistance. India also \r\ncontributes annually to the fund of the United Nations \r\nRelief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in \r\nthe Near East (UNRWA). India recently increased its \r\ncontribution to UNRWA to $1.25 million. In addition, \r\nfive projects undertaken in Palestine are being funded \r\nfrom the India-Brazil-South Africa Fund.\r\nIndia reiterates its advocacy for a peaceful dialogue \r\nbetween Palestine and Israel, and is hopeful of its early \r\nresumption.On this important day, the Prime Minister \r\nhas furthermore conveyed that our best wishes will \r\nremain with people of the State of Palestine on their \r\njourney towards achieving the objectives of a just cause.\r\nEarlier this month, India’s Minister of State for \r\nExternal Affairs, Mr. M. J. Akbar, visited Palestine \r\nfor the first meeting of the India-Palestine Joint \r\nCommission. The Joint Commission will facilitate \r\nfurther cooperation in a range of sectors, including \r\ninformation technology, security, youth affairs and \r\nsports, education, health, agriculture, tourism and \r\nculture. During his visit, a foundation stone was laid \r\nfor a $12 million Palestine-India Techno Park project in \r\nRamallah. The project aims to contribute to Palestine’s \r\neconomy, create jobs for Palestinian youth and facilitate \r\nexpertise in the digital sector.\r\nIndia appreciates the commendable work done \r\nby UNWRA over the past seven decades. India \r\ncontributed $4 million to the National Early Recovery \r\nand Reconstruction Plan for Gaza. The Government of \r\nIndia also helped set up two vocational training centres \r\nin Yatta and Hebron. The India-Palestine Centre for \r\nExcellence in Information Communication Technology \r\nand Digital Learning and the Innovation Centre in \r\nAl-Quds University, Abu Dees, and its satellite Centre \r\nin Ramallah are fully functional now and, in July 2016, \r\nthe first group of students graduated from the Centre.\r\nMore than 12,000 Palestinians have so far graduated \r\nfrom Indian universities. India offers 100 training slots \r\nin a range of sectors annually to Palestinians. That is in \r\naddition to 25 scholarships for higher education. India \r\nhas also offered training to Palestinian security forces, \r\nPalestinian customs officials and diplomats.\r\nRegrettably, the security situation continues to \r\ndeteriorate. The imperative need is for restraint and \r\nmoderation. We firmly believe that dialogue is the \r\nonly viable option in the search for a just, durable and \r\ncomprehensive peaceful solution of the Palestinian \r\nissue. We hope that both sides will demonstrate the \r\nnecessary political will to return to the negotiations.\r\nMr. Fazeel (Maldives): The Republic of Maldives \r\nexpresses its continued appreciation to Mr. Fodé Seck, \r\nPermanent Representative of Senegal to the United \r\nNations and Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, as well \r\nas to the Committee itself for the commendable work in \r\nthe discharge of its mandate.\r\nThe Republic of Maldives expresses its grave \r\nconcern regarding the escalating tensions in Palestine \r\nfollowing the report (A/71/35) of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople. The report covers the further deterioration of \r\nthe security and humanitarian situation in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, during \r\nthe reporting period, from October 2015 to October \r\n2016. The report also raised serious concerns about the \r\nprotection of civilians, including children.\r\nWe have observed a series of worrying events and \r\ntrends emerging since the upsurge in violence that \r\nbegan in October 2015 in the West Bank, including \r\nEast Jerusalem. During the escalation of violence, \r\nmore than 230 Palestinians and 32 Israelis were killed. \r\nIn addition, the report (A/70/836) of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on children and armed conflict issued in April \r\nhighlights the increasing number of Palestinian children \r\narrested and detained by the Israeli occupying forces \r\nand prosecuted by juvenile military courts in the West \r\nBank. At the end of 2015, 422 Palestinian minors under \r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 19/25\r\n18 years, of whom at least 116 were between the ages \r\nof 12 and 15, were being held in detention by the Israeli \r\nauthorities. The response of the Israeli authorities to \r\noffences by Palestinian minors is frequently carried out \r\nwith disproportionate and deadly force.\r\nViolence begets violence. Situations of hopelessness, \r\ndesolation and despair can breed only contempt, which \r\nwill eventually be manifested in violence. Lasting \r\npeace will not, and cannot, be assured unless the hope \r\nof a peaceful future is secured now for all the children \r\nof the region.\r\nMaldives condemns the continued use of \r\nadministrative detention, punitive demolitions, \r\nmovement restrictions and other measures that \r\nnegatively affect the human rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople on a continuous basis, as reported by the Special \r\nRapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories. The Israeli occupying \r\nforces continued to carry out frequent military raids and \r\nincursions injuring and killing hundreds of Palestinians, \r\nincluding children, with more than 6,000 Palestinians \r\nheld in Israeli prisons and detention centres.\r\nFurthermore, the Special Rapporteur on violence \r\nagainst women, its causes and consequences has noted \r\nthat specific groups of women in Israel, including \r\nwomen from the Palestinian minority, asylum seekers \r\nand refugees, face multiple forms of discrimination \r\nand heightened risk of violence. Israeli authorities \r\nhave repeatedly rejected the request by the Special \r\nRapporteur on the situation of human rights in the \r\nPalestinian territory occupied since 1967 to conduct \r\na mission to the occupied Palestinian territory. In \r\naddition, the Special Rapporteur notes in his report \r\n(see A/71/554) that the two preceding mandate-holders \r\nwere similarly refused access. Maldives affirms that \r\nthe missions of the special rapporteurs are essential \r\nfor the comprehensive and independent fact-finding \r\nthat is required for a true analysis of the human rights \r\nsituation on the ground.\r\nMaldives notes with concern the increasing \r\nnumber of house demolitions being carried out by the \r\nIsraeli military offensive in the West Bank, including \r\nin East Jerusalem, and the development of new Israeli \r\nlegislation to permit the confiscation of privately \r\nowned Palestinian lands and to enable more than \r\n100 outposts in the occupied West Bank to be legally \r\nrepurposed for Israeli settlement activity. Enacting \r\nthat legislation could violate international law, while \r\nundermining Palestinians’ right to self-determination \r\nand violating their rights to property, freedom of \r\nmovement and development.\r\nSimilarly, the situation remains dire in Gaza, \r\nwhere there is an urgent need to repair and rebuild \r\nthe thousands of houses that have been damaged and \r\ndestroyed. However, the continuing Israeli blockade of \r\nGaza has prevented the long-overdue reconstruction \r\nthere, and it continues to obstruct the movement \r\nof persons and goods, including access for critical \r\nhumanitarian aid. Maldives therefore urges the United \r\nNations community to identify concrete measures \r\nthat could be taken to lift the blockade and allow the \r\nsituation to improve.\r\nMaldives welcomes the continuing work of the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East in providing emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance in spite of serious financial \r\nchallenges. In the past year, relief was provided to \r\nover 1.2 million refugees, primarily in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory and in Syria. We urge the \r\ninternational community to support the agency in its \r\nhumanitarian work.\r\nTwenty-three years ago the first Oslo Accord was \r\nsigned between Israel and the Palestine Liberation \r\nOrganization. Both entities recognized each other \r\nand laid the groundwork for a solution based on two \r\nindependent States. However, the reality is that two \r\nyears have passed since the process of negotiation was \r\ninterrupted, and an indisputable marginalization of the \r\ntwo-State solution has ensued. Maldives calls on all the \r\nparties involved to work consistently to unblock the \r\npeace process. In order for the two States to coexist, \r\nprogress towards reconciliation without preconditions \r\nis essential. Maldives is a firm supporter of the two-\r\nState solution and the recognition of a sovereign and \r\nindependent State of Palestine based on the pre-1967 \r\nborders with East Jerusalem as its capital, and it \r\nencourages the parties to resume direct negotiations in \r\norder to achieve lasting peace.\r\nOn 29 November, the countries of the world come \r\ntogether to commemorate the International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People. Maldives urges \r\nthe international community to move beyond rhetoric, \r\nto take steps towards a genuine, lasting peace in the \r\nregion and to steadfastly support the Palestinian people.\r\nMr. Rivero Rosario (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nBefore beginning my statement on the topic of this \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n20/25 16-40519\r\nmeeting, I wish to express deep appreciation on behalf \r\nof my delegation, my Government and the Cuban \r\npeople for the moving words and respect expressed with \r\nregard to the former President and leader of the Cuban \r\nRevolution, Head of State and Commander Fidel Castro \r\nRuz. He was not only a friend, but a tireless warrior for \r\nself-determination and for the rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople. I also wish to express our appreciation to the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and to everyone \r\npresent for the message and respect addressed to the \r\nCuban people.\r\nWe wish to thank His Excellency Ambassador \r\nFodé Seck, Chair of the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, for \r\npreparing the report (A/71/35) and for the opportunity \r\nto hear a statement by the Rapporteur of the Committee, \r\nAmbassador Carmelo Inguanez.\r\nThe numerous violations of international law, in \r\nparticular humanitarian law and human rights law, \r\ncommitted by Israel, the occupying Power, since 1967 in \r\nits almost 50 years of foreign military occupation of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem \r\nand the Syrian Golan, continued and increased during \r\nthe period under consideration. Israel has deliberately \r\nand systematically maintained all of its illegal policies \r\nand practices, which have led to widespread human \r\nsuffering and destabilized the situation. They have \r\ncaused deaths and injuries among Palestinian civilians \r\nin a sustained cycle of violence; the arrest and detention \r\nof Palestinians, including children; the displacement \r\nand forced relocation of Palestinians; provocations and \r\ninstigations, particularly in occupied East Jerusalem; \r\nand a wide-ranging network of collective punishment.\r\nIsrael has continued its campaign of establishing \r\nillegal settlements throughout the West Bank, including \r\nEast Jerusalem. Over the past year, the construction and \r\nexpansion of settlements and the wall, the relocation of \r\nIsraeli settlers and the confiscation of land and natural \r\nresources, the demolition of houses and the forced \r\ndisplacement of the Palestinian civilian population \r\ncontinued as before, and even intensified, which has \r\ncontributed to the fragmented nature of the Palestinian \r\nterritory and seriously affected the viability of the two-\r\nState solution based on pre-1967 borders.\r\nThe critical situation resulting from the blockade \r\nof the Gaza Strip by air, land and sea is mentioned in \r\nthe report, which reflects the fact that the blockade \r\nis responsible for the near-total isolation and grave \r\nprivation of the 2 million Palestinian civilians who \r\nreside in the area. A serious humanitarian crisis \r\npersists in Gaza, and socioeconomic conditions are at \r\ntheir lowest levels since the occupation began in 1967, \r\nresulting in an extremely difficult and unsustainable \r\nsituation that requires an immediate solution.\r\nCuba has historically maintained its firm support \r\nfor, and solidarity with, the just cause of the Palestinian \r\npeople, based on clear and unequivocal principles in \r\nfavour of self-determination. We vigorously support \r\nall efforts aimed at promoting a just and lasting \r\nsolution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine, \r\nwhich inexorably demands the genuine exercise of \r\nthe inalienable right of the Palestinian people to build \r\ntheir own State within the pre-1967 borders with East \r\nJerusalem as their capital.\r\nCuba reiterates its call for an end to the prolonged \r\nand illegal Israeli occupation of the occupied \r\nPalestinian territories, the immediate, unconditional \r\nand complete lifting of the cruel and illegal blockade of \r\nthe Gaza Strip and the opening of border crossings and \r\ncheckpoints, to give free access to humanitarian aid \r\nand to allow the movement of goods and people to and \r\nfrom the Gaza Strip. Israel’s illegal actions constitute a \r\ngrave violation of international law and again reaffirm \r\nthe applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territory, including East \r\nJerusalem, and other Arab territories under Israeli \r\noccupation since 1967, requiring Israel’s acceptance \r\nof the de jure applicability of the Convention. Israel’s \r\ncontinuing implementation of such policies runs \r\ncontrary to the objectives of the peace process.\r\nIn this scenario, it must not be forgotten that \r\nsituations related to geography require solutions and \r\ncan also affect the possibility of achieving peace. We \r\nneed a comprehensive, just and lasting solution to the \r\nquestion of the city of Jerusalem that takes into account \r\nthe legitimate concerns of the Palestinian and Israeli \r\nsides, and that Israel’s imposition of its legislation, \r\njurisdiction and administration in Jerusalem and the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan is not only null and void, but \r\ncontrary to a successful peace process. In that context, \r\nwe consider it extremely necessary to continue working \r\nwith the United Nations in seeking greater clarity within \r\nthe international community regarding the persistent \r\nand growing dangers in Palestine and the Middle East \r\nof the failure to find a just and lasting solution to the \r\nconflict between the two countries.\r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 21/25\r\nThe commendable work of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople must continue. The Secretariat’s Division \r\nfor Palestinian Rights must maintain its useful and \r\nconstructive contribution to forging an international \r\nconsensus on the question of Palestine and the urgency \r\nof reaching a peaceful settlement of the issue. As our \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs proposed today in his \r\nmessage in solidarity with the Palestinian people, the \r\ninternational community must therefore not remain \r\nimpassive to such abuses and violations. We call on \r\nall States Members of the United Nations to make \r\nevery possible effort to resume and support a process \r\nguaranteeing a comprehensive, just and lasting \r\npeace based on the two-State solution, within the \r\ninternationally recognized pre-1967 borders and based \r\non the Arab Peace Initiative.\r\nMoreover, as the Cuban Minister indicated in his \r\nmessage, the Security Council must take practical \r\nsteps without further delay to ensure that Israel ends \r\nits aggression against the Palestinian people and is \r\nheld accountable for the crimes of violence, collective \r\npunishment, arbitrary detention, mass incarceration \r\nand genocide committed against that people. It must \r\nforthwith take action and accept the request for \r\nrecognition as a State Member of the United Nations \r\nsubmitted by Palestine in 2011, in line with the desire \r\nexpressed by the great majority of States. The historic \r\ndebt to the Palestinian people is enormous and must \r\nbe settled.\r\nCuba reaffirms its indefatigable solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian people and its determination to continue \r\nsupporting them in their legitimate struggle for justice \r\nand dignity and in defence of their inalienable right to \r\nself-determination and sovereignty in the independent \r\nState of Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nMrs. Rubiales de Chamorro (Nicaragua) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): On behalf of the people and the Government \r\nof Nicaragua and President Commander Daniel \r\nOrtega Saavedra, we greet this day of 29 November, \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People.\r\nNicaragua associates itself with the statement \r\nmade on behalf of the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and the \r\nreport (A/71/35) introduced by Ambassador Carmelo \r\nInguanez, Rapporteur of the Committee.\r\nFollowing the triumph of our revolution in 1979, \r\nNicaragua officially recognized the State of Palestinian, \r\nestablished diplomatic relations with its authorities, \r\nand strengthened the fraternal relations of cooperation \r\nand solidarity between our peoples, who have spent \r\nmany years fighting for national liberation. We are \r\nproud to celebrate over four decades of friendship \r\nand solidarity in which Nicaragua has recognized the \r\nstruggle of the Palestinian people as its own. We share \r\nthe same suffering and the same oppression, and ever \r\nsince Nicaragua attained peace we have committed \r\nourselves to corresponding with the Palestinian people, \r\ncontinually recalling that in our most difficult times, \r\nthey were always with us.\r\nI should like to quote from the greeting of our \r\nPresident, Commander Daniel Ortega Saavedra, on \r\nthe day of the anniversary of the independence of \r\nPalestine on this International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People:\r\n“I take this opportunity to renew our vows of \r\nsolidarity with the struggle of the heroic Palestinian \r\npeople, which has stoically resisted aggression and \r\nthe violation of their rights. We are confident that, \r\nwith the help of God, it will very soon be possible \r\nto establish, through dialogue and negotiation, \r\nthe basis for a lasting solution, the international \r\nrecognition of Palestine and its full membership of \r\nthe United Nations.”\r\nIn solidarity, commitment and brotherhood, we \r\nwelcome the Palestinian leaders’ initiative to declare \r\n2017 the year of the end of the occupation of Palestine, \r\nand reiterate our support for initiatives to ensure \r\nPalestine its right to a sovereign State, within the pre-\r\n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, and to \r\nenable the two States, Palestine and Israel, to coexist in \r\npeace, harmony and prosperity.\r\nNicaragua welcomes the initiatives of the Russian \r\nFederation, the Arab Peace Initiative, the Egyptian \r\ninitiative and the French initiative. We regret Israel’s \r\nrefusal to participate in the peace conference, which \r\ndemonstrates its lack of interest in a negotiated, just \r\nand lasting solution. It is imperative to put an end to \r\nthe occupation and demand the immediate cessation \r\nof settlement construction, an end to the criminal \r\nblockade of Gaza and the total release of all Palestinian \r\nprisoners. The Security Council, obstructing the two-\r\nState solution through the use and abuse of the veto \r\non the part of one of its permanent members, and \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n22/25 16-40519\r\npromoting Israel’s impunity, continues to perpetuate \r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian people in the occupied \r\nterritories and of more than 5.5 million Palestinians \r\nrefugees worldwide, whom we offer our full solidarity.\r\nAt the moment when the implementation of \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development \r\nObjectives are urgently needed, Palestine, like every \r\nother State, has every right to receive development aid \r\nand investment. But if we allow Israel’s endless, vicious \r\ncycle of mass destruction and massacres to continue, \r\nthe help of the international community will serve only \r\nto help that people eke out a survival. We encourage \r\nMember States to secure the necessary funds for the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East and to support the United \r\nNations Conference on Trade and Development in its \r\nefforts to meet the costs of the occupation.\r\nNicaragua and the State of Palestine recently signed \r\nin 2016 a memorandum of understanding to strengthen \r\nactions that benefit both peoples and Governments \r\nwith a view to the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, and to strengthen peace \r\nand the rule of law, enhance communication and \r\ninformation technology, and promote health, education \r\nand the exchange of experiences among young people \r\nof both nations, which are very important.\r\nWe will continue to fight until Palestine enjoys \r\nits independence, sovereignty and freedom and is \r\nrecognized, as it deserves to be, as a full Member of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nMr. García Moritán (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina wishes to make a statement concerning \r\nagenda items 34 and 35, “The situation in the Middle \r\nEast” and “The question of Palestine”, respectively, \r\nwhich my country follows with great concern.\r\nAlmost 70 years have passed since the establishment \r\nof the State of Israel and the adoption of resolution \r\n181 (II), which established the Palestine Plan of \r\nPartition, and almost 50 years since the beginning of \r\nthe occupation of the Gaza Strip, East Jerusalem and \r\nthe West Bank. Since then, we have seen numerous \r\npeace initiatives, from the Madrid Conference in 1991 \r\nto the failed attempt to resume negotiations in 2013, \r\nnone of which have achieved a just, comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace on the basis of a two-State solution, with \r\na State of Israel and a State of Palestine coexisting side \r\nby side in peace and security, on the basis of the 1967 \r\nborders and whatever the parties may determine in the \r\nnegotiation process.\r\nDespite the efforts made during these years, the \r\nsituation continues to be characterized by recurring \r\ncycles of violence and intolerance, without a short-term \r\nhorizon for progress. That is why it is urgent to renew \r\nefforts aimed at reversing the current negative trends \r\non the ground through actions taken by both parties, as \r\nwell as responsible and committed action taken by the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nArgentina reaffirms its support for the right of the \r\nPalestinian people to establish an independent and viable \r\nState recognized by all nations, as well as the right of \r\nthe State of Israel to live in peace with its neighbours \r\nwithin secure and internationally recognized borders.\r\nArgentina reiterates its concern about the persistent \r\nand continuing growth of illegal Israeli settlements in \r\nthe occupied Palestinian territories and calls for an \r\nend to their expansion. As the General Assembly has \r\nrepeatedly indicated, the settlements are contrary to \r\ninternational law, obstruct peace, weaken the prospect \r\nof a two-State solution of States living in peace and \r\nsecurity, and therefore promote the perpetuation of an \r\nunsustainable status quo.\r\nArgentina considers it unacceptable for Hamas \r\nand other Palestinian groups to launch attacks against \r\nIsraeli civilians. The launching of rockets against \r\nIsrael from the Gaza Strip must cease immediately. \r\nMy country strongly condemns all terrorist acts and \r\nis convinced that there is no military solution to the \r\nconflict, nor is there a solution that can be imposed \r\nby terrorist means. Palestinian leaders must sincerely \r\naddress Israeli security concerns. At the same time, \r\nwe note with concern that Israel’s response to the \r\nsituation is almost exclusively focused on the security \r\ndimension, including cases of excessive use of force \r\nby Israeli forces in the context of attacks and alleged \r\nattacks conducted by Palestinians and in combat, as \r\nwell as in the continued violence of the settlers.\r\nWith regard to the situation in East Jerusalem, \r\nArgentina reaffirms the special status of Jerusalem in \r\naccordance with relevant United Nations resolutions, \r\nand in that regard rejects any unilateral attempt to \r\nmodify it, in particular with regard to the Old City, \r\nwhich has a special meaning for the three great \r\nmonotheistic religions. My country believes that the \r\nHoly City should be a place of convergence and peace, \r\nand that free access to holy sites must be guaranteed for \r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 23/25\r\nfaithful Jews, Muslims and Christians. Any attempt to \r\ndeny or relativize the historical link and the profound \r\nmeaning of those places for the three religions is \r\ncompletely unacceptable, does not contribute to the \r\nobjective of finding a peaceful solution to the conflict, \r\nand reinforces negative prejudices and mistrust between \r\nthe parties.\r\nIn a world that continues to witness cross-border \r\nterrorist acts, we believe that achieving a lasting \r\nsolution to the Palestinian question would contribute \r\nsignificantly to providing stability to that part of the \r\nworld, which is in such upheaval. That is why we deplore \r\nthe inflammatory rhetoric of extremists on both sides.\r\nCollective efforts are required for a two-State \r\nsolution, as set out in the relevant resolutions of the \r\nGeneral Assembly and of the Security Council, the \r\nroad map and the Arab Peace Initiative.\r\nMy country’s identity has been shaped by interaction \r\namong communities of different origins, ethnicities \r\nand religions, where Christians, Jews and Muslims \r\nlive in harmony. It was Maestro Daniel Barenboim, \r\nan Argentinian-Israeli musician and a Palestinian \r\nby adoption, who in 1999 founded the West-Eastern \r\nDivan Orchestra to promote intercultural dialogue \r\nthrough music. In February, the Secretary-General \r\ndesignated the Orchestra as a United Nations Global \r\nAdvocate for Cultural Understanding in recognition of \r\nits contribution to breaking down barriers and building \r\nbridges between communities. The Orchestra is proof \r\nthat dialogue among different communities and cultures \r\nis possible and necessary.\r\nAware that nothing is easy and that nothing happens \r\novernight, Argentina wishes once again to call on \r\nPalestinians and Israelis to resume peace talks, acting \r\nin good faith, with f lexibility and in accordance with \r\ninternational law, with a view to reaching an agreement \r\non outstanding issues concerning the final status of \r\nPalestine in all its aspects.\r\nMr. Paolino (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): As we \r\ncommemorate another anniversary of the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, Uruguay \r\nechoes the wish expressed by other Members of the \r\nOrganization that we shall soon witness the long-\r\nsought peace that will allow that people to enjoy \r\ntheir legitimate right to be part of a sovereign and \r\nindependent Palestinian State.\r\nAlmost 70 years ago, the General Assembly \r\nadopted resolution 181 (II), which sought the partition \r\nof Palestine and the creation of an Arab State and a \r\nJewish State. Uruguay strongly supported that solution \r\nand was convinced that it would allow Israel and \r\nPalestine to live in peace within secure borders. Today, \r\nUruguay wishes to reaffirm once again the right of \r\nIsrael and Palestine to live in peace within secure and \r\ninternationally recognized borders, in an environment \r\nof renewed cooperation and free from any threat or \r\naction that could undermine peace. Uruguay also \r\nreiterates its support for a solution consisting of two \r\nindependent States. We are convinced that this is the \r\nonly way that will allow for the peaceful coexistence of \r\nIsrael and Palestine.\r\nUruguay has strong ties of friendship with the \r\nState of Israel and with the State of Palestine. Their \r\nfull membership in the Organization and their full \r\nenjoyment of the self-determination of their people are \r\nthe logical consequences of the process that has been \r\nunder way since it was recognized as a full-f ledged \r\nState. It is a full-f ledged State capable of completely \r\neliminating terrorism from its territory and living \r\nin peace with the State of Israel and other States in \r\nthe region.\r\nIn that belief, very early on Uruguay recognized \r\nthe State of Israel and later, when we determined that \r\nthe inconclusive process could not continue to drag \r\non, the State of Palestine. Many other Latin American \r\nStates did the same. Today, our country has embassies \r\nin Israel and Palestine, and both countries have \r\nembassies in Uruguay. It is crucial for the international \r\ncommunity to step up its efforts, assist in the process \r\nand encourage the parties to return to the negotiating \r\ntable in order to achieve a peaceful, fair, negotiated and \r\nlasting solution that is in line with international law and \r\ntakes the interests of both nations into account.\r\nIn that regard, the parties must create the \r\nconditions necessary for the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the most recent Quartet report \r\naimed at resuming negotiations among them, as well \r\nas actions and policies that demonstrate their firm \r\ncommitment to the two-State solution. In the same \r\nvein, the parties must refrain from adopting unilateral \r\ndecisions that hinder dialogue and honour their \r\nobligations under international law.\r\nUruguay remains concerned about the decision of \r\nthe Israeli authorities to pursue settlement construction. \r\nA/71/PV.49 29/11/2016\r\n24/25 16-40519\r\nUnder international law, the settlements are illegal and \r\nrun counter to the recommendations of the Quartet for \r\nMiddle East Peace. Uruguay encourages the State of \r\nIsrael to stop building illegal settlements, confiscating \r\nland and destroying Palestinian homes. Incitement \r\nto violence and the glorification of terrorist acts \r\nare equally worrisome. It is crucial for Israeli and \r\nPalestinian authorities to send clear political signals in \r\norder to break the vicious circle of misunderstandings \r\nand violent clashes that have plagued the region time \r\nand again.\r\nMore than two years since the last military conflict \r\nin the Gaza Strip, which ended tragically with thousands \r\ndead and injured amid widespread destruction of \r\ncatastrophic proportions, the humanitarian situation \r\nremains intolerable and aggravated by a blockade that \r\nexacerbates the violence arising from the impatience \r\nand expectations of almost 2 million inhabitants who \r\nlanguish in poverty and unemployment and have very \r\nlittle hope for the future. Uruguay is concerned that if \r\nthe current trend continues, the two-State solution will \r\nno longer be viable. For that reason, Uruguay reaffirms \r\nits willingness to continue working in order to resume \r\nthe peace process through all existing initiatives to \r\nbreak the status quo and, in that way, make progress in \r\nthe peace talks.\r\nMr. Dehghani (Islamic Republic of Iran): While \r\nwe commend the United Nations system, the Secretariat \r\nand helpful and supportive Member States for their \r\ntireless efforts to reduce the plight of the Palestinian \r\npeople, we note with grave concern the latest disturbing \r\ndevelopments in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nas reflected in the documents under consideration \r\ntoday. We regret that the efforts made so far by the \r\ninternational community have mostly failed or proven \r\ninadequate due to the intransigence of the Israeli \r\nregime and its continued unlawful and criminal acts \r\nand policies against the people of Palestine.\r\nFor decades, year after year, the United Nations \r\nhas condemned Israel for the various crimes it commits \r\nagainst Palestine and its people in the occupied \r\nPalestinian territory. But that occupying regime, which \r\nenjoys undeserved support from a handful of allies, \r\ncontinues to disregard and disrespect the persistent \r\ndemands of the international community to abide by \r\ninternational law. It is unfortunate that a host of criminal \r\npractices and policies are being perpetrated by Israel \r\nwith impunity and that the international community is \r\nyet to take any measure to address them.\r\nThe systematic violation of the rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, including the demolition of homes, \r\nthe forced displacement of Palestinian civilians, the \r\narrest and detention of Palestinians, including children \r\nand incessant violence, terror and provocations by Israeli \r\nsettlers and extremists, including at sensitive religious \r\nsites, particularly Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, have \r\npersisted unabated. At the same time, the imposition \r\nof the illegal blockade on the Gaza Strip continues \r\nto cause massive deprivation and hopelessness and is \r\nfuelling a grave humanitarian crisis. As such, Israel \r\ndeliberately and systematically violates each and every \r\nbasic norm of international law, including international \r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nThe increasing number of illegal settlements in \r\nPalestinian territory, which constitute not only grave \r\nbreaches of the Fourth Geneva Convention but war \r\ncrimes, have long demonstrated that the Israeli regime \r\nhas never had any interest in peace with the Palestinians. \r\nThe adverse impacts of the Israeli occupation and \r\nviolations of the rules and principles of international \r\nlaw are immense and have inflicted unbearable \r\nhardships on all aspects of the lives of the Palestinians, \r\nincluding from a socioeconomic perspective.\r\nAs in the past, the situation in Palestine requires \r\nurgent international attention and action. The continued \r\nillegal and brutal Israeli occupation not only causes \r\nmuch misery for the Palestinian people, but also lies \r\nat the origin of various tensions in the Middle East \r\nand dangerously inflames them in the region’s volatile \r\nsituation, with far-reaching and serious consequences \r\nfor international peace and security. While Israeli \r\ncriminal acts and policies are worsening and can trigger \r\nfurther crises at any moment, the extremely fragile \r\nsituation on the ground must be seriously addressed to \r\navert further destabilization.\r\nRegrettably and despite the clear global consensus \r\non the illegality of Israeli policies and practices on \r\nPalestinian territory, the Security Council continues \r\nto be paralysed, failing to uphold its obligations. That \r\nshould change. The Security Council should shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities under the Charter of the United Nations \r\nand international law to compel Israel to respect the \r\nnorms of international law, including international \r\nhumanitarian law, and to end its war crimes and human \r\nrights violations against the Palestinian people and its \r\nillegal occupation of the Palestinian land and the plight \r\nof the Palestinian refugees.\r\n29/11/2016 A/71/PV.49\r\n16-40519 25/25\r\nI would like to conclude by reiterating the \r\nunwavering support of the people and Government of \r\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran to the oppressed Palestinian \r\nnation. Once again, we assure them that we will do \r\neverything in our power to help them realize the cause \r\nof a free and prosperous Palestine.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker on this item for this meeting.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6 p.m.\r\n"
