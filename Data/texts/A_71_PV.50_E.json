"United Nations A/71/PV.50\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n50th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 30 November 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\n In the absence of the President, Mr. Mnatsakanyan \r\n(Armenia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 35 (continued)\r\nQuestion of Palestine\r\nReport of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People \r\n(А/71/35)\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (А/71/359)\r\nNote by the Secretary-General (A/71/174)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/71/L.18, A/71/L.19, \r\nA/71/L.20 and A/71/L.21)\r\nMrs. Matar (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): I have \r\nthe honour to deliver a statement on behalf of the \r\nPermanent Representative of the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nto the United Nations.\r\nOn this occasion, His Majesty King Hamad bin Isa \r\nAl Khalifa of Bahrain has sent a letter of solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian people to the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, in \r\nwhich he writes:\r\n“The International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People reflects the attention that the \r\nUnited Nations and the international community \r\nattach to the question of Palestine and their solid \r\ncommitment to meeting the legitimate aspirations \r\nof Palestinians and to granting them their rights, \r\nincluding the right to self-determination and the \r\nright to establish their own independent State, \r\nsimilar to other peoples of the world.”\r\nHis Majesty also writes:\r\n“The Kingdom of Bahrain has always stressed \r\nits support for the establishment of a State of \r\nPalestine with Jerusalem as its capital. We have \r\nalways called on the international community to \r\nmake every effort to grant the Palestinian people \r\ntheir inalienable rights and to achieve a just and \r\ncomprehensive peace, in accordance with relevant \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, including Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967), 338 (1973), 1397 \r\n(2002) and 1515 (2003), based on the two-State \r\nsolution, the Madrid terms of reference of the \r\npeace process and the Arab Peace Initiative. All \r\nof these instruments call for the full withdrawal \r\nof Israel from Palestinian territories, including \r\nEast Jerusalem, and from all Arab territories \r\noccupied since 1967. They also call for granting the \r\nPalestinian people their inalienable rights.”\r\nI would like to extend my sincere thanks to \r\nthe Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Fodé Seck, Permanent Representative \r\nof Senegal to the United Nations, and to all members \r\nof the Committee for their valuable report (A/71/35). \r\nI would also like to express my appreciation to all \r\nmembers of the Committee for their ongoing efforts to \r\nensure the inalienable rights of the Palestinian people \r\nand to allow Palestinians to put an end to the occupation \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Those \r\nrights are inalienable and fundamental, according to \r\nSecurity Council resolution 237 (1967). The outrageous \r\ndeterioration of the situation in the occupied territories, \r\nas detailed in the report, is the result of Israel’s \r\nannexation and settlement policy and its continued \r\nconstruction of the separation wall in the West Bank \r\nand around Jerusalem.\r\nWe reiterate our thanks to the Committee and \r\nto the Division for Palestinian Rights for their \r\nactivities during the reporting period, as detailed in \r\nthe Committee’s report. Those activities include the \r\nInternational Conference on the Question of Jerusalem, \r\nwhich took place in Jakarta on 14 and 15 December, \r\n2015; the United Nations Civil Society Forum on the \r\nQuestion of Palestine, under the theme of “Civil society \r\naction in support of justice in Palestine and ending the \r\noccupation”, held in Jakarta on 16 December, 2015; the \r\nUnited Nations Round Table on Legal Aspects of the \r\nQuestion of Palestine, in Amman from 15 to 17 March; \r\nthe International Conference on the Question of \r\nJerusalem, in Dakar on 3 and 4 May; the United Nations \r\nSeminar on Assistance to the Palestinian People, in \r\nStockholm on 19 and 20 May; and other activities \r\nseeking to raise awareness of the just Palestinian cause. \r\nWe would also like to thank the Department of Public \r\nInformation for its special information programme \r\non the question of Palestine, for its annual training \r\nprogramme for Palestinian journalists, and for its call \r\non all United Nations information centres to carry \r\nout activities related to the inalienable rights of the \r\nPalestinian people.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain reiterates its firm \r\nposition in support of the Palestinian question. We \r\nmust strive to meet the aspirations of the Palestinian \r\npeople to achieve a comprehensive, just and lasting \r\npeace that will guarantee the legitimate rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, including the establishment of their \r\nown independent State, with Jerusalem as its capital, on \r\nall territories that have been occupied since 1967. That \r\nmust be done in a manner that will ensure the return \r\nof Palestinian refugees to their homeland, pursuant to \r\ninternational terms of reference and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, which is the only genuine solution that would \r\nlay the foundation for peace in the region.\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): We commemorate the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople every year. Yet for far too long the Day has been \r\na somber and grim reminder of the unending suffering \r\nof the Palestinian people at the hands of an occupier \r\nthat has shown utter disregard for the principles of \r\ninternational law and the morals of humanity.\r\nThe resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nis essential for peace and stability throughout the \r\nMiddle East. It is also essential to enable us to address \r\nsome of the drivers of extremism and terrorism. It is \r\nthat conflict that has contributed most significantly \r\nto the anger and frustration in the Arab and the \r\nIslamic world. The continued spread of illegal Israeli \r\nsettlements on Palestinian lands, the blockade of Gaza, \r\nthe provocations around the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque and \r\nthe continued imprisonment of Palestinians are all real \r\nand present obstacles to a two-State solution. Those \r\nactions, along with the recent proclamations from \r\nIsrael that a two-State solution no longer needs to be \r\npursued, reflect a willful defiance of the international \r\nconsensus that the only viable option for durable peace \r\nlies in such a solution. They are also a testimony to \r\nthe fact that the occupying Power is being emboldened \r\nby the lack of resolute action on the part of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe 5.2 million Palestinian refugees who were \r\nforcibly displaced from their homes nearly 70 years ago \r\nand denied their inalienable right to return represent a \r\ntravesty of justice and morality. Their right to return \r\nis pivotal to the vision of a peaceful and stable Middle \r\nEast. The expropriation of Palestinian lands and the \r\ncontinued expansion of illegal settlements in occupied \r\nterritories are other egregious Israeli inequities that \r\nconstitute total defiance of its international obligations.\r\nThe so-called legalization bill in the Israeli \r\nparliament aims at providing a veneer of legality \r\nto that shameless land-grab. The demolition of \r\nPalestinian homes and expulsion of Palestinians from \r\ntheir properties further compound the suffering of the \r\npeople. The collective punishment meted out through \r\nthe blockade of Gaza, now in its ninth year, continues to \r\nwreak havoc on the lives of the residents of the enclave. \r\nIt also seriously impedes the ability of the United \r\nNations and other humanitarian agencies to deliver \r\nmuch-needed support to embattled communities as \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 3/32\r\nthey try to rebuild shattered lives after the devastation \r\ncaused by the Israeli aggression in 2014.\r\nThrough all this, the United Nations has remained \r\nseized of the Palestinian question. Countless United \r\nNations resolutions testify to the political and diplomatic \r\ncapital spent by the international community on the \r\nPalestinian cause. And yet, none of it has been able to \r\ntransform the grim reality of daily existence for the \r\nPalestinian people. \r\nThrough its resolution 2535 (XXIV) B of \r\n10 December 1969, the General Assembly expressed \r\ngrave concern at the denial of basic rights to the \r\nPalestinians through collective punishment, arbitrary \r\ndetention, curfews, the destruction of homes and \r\nproperty, deportation and other repressive acts. Almost \r\nhalf a century later, sadly, the draft resolution that we \r\nwill adopt tomorrow will speak to the same trials and \r\ntribulations. That lack of progress is an indictment not \r\nof the commitment of the many countries, including my \r\nown, that have steadfastly supported the Palestinian \r\ncause, but of the few that have the capacity to bring \r\nabout material change but lack the will to do so. \r\nRenewed demands for the recognition of the State of \r\nPalestine are a clarion call that must be heeded.\r\nThe inaction of the Security Council has not only \r\nundermined its own credibility, but has also weakened \r\nthe ideals that the Organization espouses — the ideals \r\nof human dignity, of peaceful coexistence based on \r\nthe sovereign equality of all nations, and of the right \r\nto self-determination of all peoples. The resumption \r\nof negotiations is the only way forward. The \r\nSecurity Council should live up to its obligations and \r\nresponsibilities and summon the political courage \r\nand vision to adopt a resolution with parameters and \r\ntimelines to end the occupation. However, talks should \r\nbe meaningful and results-oriented and not a means for \r\nproviding space for Israel to further shrink prospects \r\nfor a contiguous State of Palestine.\r\nAnother dimension of conflict in the Middle East is \r\nthe Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan. The Israeli \r\nsettlement policy and illegal practices of controlling \r\nresources and changing the demographic composition \r\nand legal status of the occupied Syrian Golan is a \r\nviolation and in blatant disregard of United Nations \r\nresolutions. Lasting and sustainable peace in the \r\nMiddle East requires bold decisions. Withdrawal of the \r\noccupation forces from all Arab lands, including from \r\nLebanon and the Syrian Golan Heights, is vital not only \r\nto the future of the next generation of Palestinians but \r\nto international peace and international security.\r\nIn conclusion, let me reiterate Pakistan’s unwavering \r\nsolidarity with the people of Palestine, which has \r\nbeen consistently manifested by its support over the \r\ndecades. We call for an end to the constant delays \r\nand the realization of the legitimate and inalienable \r\nrights of the Palestinian people, which is an essential \r\nprerequisite to sustainable peace in the Middle East. \r\nThe construction of an architecture of global stability \r\nand prosperity at this seminal juncture of world history \r\ncannot be built on injustice and denial of the rights of \r\nthe Palestinian people.\r\nMr. Al Harthy (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the Sultanate of Oman, I would like to thank \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for convening \r\nthis special meeting to consider the Palestinian question \r\nand the situation in the Middle East. I would also like \r\nto thank the representative of Senegal for his statement \r\non behalf of the President of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople (see A/71/PV.49). We commend him for the \r\nactivities of the Committee.\r\nThe Israeli forces’ illegal expansionist practices in \r\nthe West Bank and East Jerusalem and their breach of \r\ninternational law and norms through settlement activity \r\nand the building of a separation wall are f lagrant \r\nviolations of the human rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople living in the occupied territories, as well as \r\nof the provisions of international humanitarian and \r\nhuman rights law. My country therefore calls on the \r\ninternational community, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil, to fulfil its responsibility and compel Israel, \r\nthe occupying Power, to cease these practices and \r\npolicies and its attempts to alter the demography on the \r\nground in Palestine.\r\nWe call on Israel to return to negotiations to end \r\nthe occupation of the Palestinian territories and build \r\nthe State of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\npursuant to the relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nand the Arab Peace Initiative. We also call on Israel to \r\nwithdraw from the Syrian Golan and other areas under \r\nIsraeli occupation in south Lebanon.\r\nMy country wishes to stress that peace and stability \r\ncan be achieved only through dialogue and negotiations. \r\nOur position was succinctly set forth in the statement \r\nof my country’s Minister for Foreign Affairs during the \r\ngeneral debate at the start of the Assemb;y’s seventy-\r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n4/32 16-40731\r\nfirst session (see A/71/PV.22). We call for serious \r\nnegotiations that would preserve the rights of all parties \r\nto live within secure borders on the basis of two States, \r\nIsrael and Palestine. We also call upon the international \r\ncommunity to support all efforts aimed at achieving a \r\nnoble goal that is shared by all peace-loving countries.\r\nMr. Sevilla Borja (Ecuador) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nFidel Castro — the eternal leader of the Cuban people, \r\nof the Latin American people and of the peoples in \r\nthe world who are seeking development, who has just \r\nentered into the pantheon of immortality — spoke a \r\ngreat truth in this very Hall in 1979: “the Palestinian \r\nquestion is the very crux of the problem of the Middle \r\nEast” (A/34/PV.31, para. 22). In fact, if the international \r\ncommunity had complied with General Assembly \r\nresolution 181 (II), of 29 November 1947 — which, \r\njust as it created the State of Israel, should also have \r\nestablished the independent State of Palestine and done \r\njustice to the Palestinian people — the world would not \r\nhave had to lament the indescribable tragedies that they \r\nhave experienced and are living today in the Middle \r\nEast region.\r\nAfter 70 years, the Palestinian people are still \r\nfighting for the right to self-determination, to exist as \r\na nation and to establish a State, like all the rest of the \r\npeoples of the Earth. These rights are theirs not only \r\nbecause of the international community’s recognition, \r\nin resolution 3236 (XXIX), adopted in 1974, but also \r\nbecause of the millennial history that precedes this \r\nPalestinian population, descendants of the Canaanites \r\nand Philistines, more than 5,000 years ago.\r\nOn the occasion of the annual observation of the \r\nInternational Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople, it is a priority to recall that after the 1948 war \r\nbetween the new State of Israel and the neighbouring \r\nArab States, more than half of the native Palestinians \r\nwere obliged to f lee or were expelled from their land. By \r\n1949, there were already 725,000 Palestinian refugees. \r\nFollowing the war of 1967, the Palestinian exodus grew, \r\nwith 500,000 additional refugees. \r\nSeventy years later, the increase in the number of \r\ndisplaced persons is dramatic and inhumane. There \r\nare 5.3 million Palestinian refugees located primarily \r\nin the Near East, who represent more than 40 per cent \r\nof the world’s long-term refugees. That percentage \r\ndemonstrates a permanent violation of rights in which \r\nthe people survive, a people whose situation is steadily \r\ndeteriorating and who are being deprived even of their \r\nright to humanitarian assistance.\r\nThis Organization has heard the testimonies \r\nof senior officials of United Nations bodies on \r\nthe difficulties that they are having in providing \r\nhumanitarian assistance to the Palestinian refugees \r\nand on the obstructions by the Government of Israel \r\nto the humanitarian aid agencies on the ground. \r\nSimilar allegations have been received by the Security \r\nCouncil with respect to other Governments that are \r\nalso obstructing the work organized through numerous \r\nCouncil resolutions for humanitarian assistance in \r\nSyria, the Sudan, South Sudan and Yemen.\r\nMy delegation reiterates once again that the lack of \r\neffective action by the Security Council, the indifference \r\nof the Powers directly involved and the obstinacy of \r\nextremist sectors in the State of Israel, encouraged by \r\noutside support, have generated unilateral policies that, \r\nas in the case of the Gaza Strip blockade, suffocate its \r\npeople, stif le its economy and impede reconstruction. \r\nMeanwhile, in the occupied Palestinian territory, \r\nthre is new legislation that contains discriminatory, \r\nanti-democratic provisions that could pose a serious \r\nthreat to the human rights of Palestinian citizens \r\nin Israel and Palestinians who live in the territory \r\noccupied in 1967. Such laws and draft laws seek, inter \r\nalia, to strip Arab citizens of their land and exclude \r\nthem from it, regulate their citizenship, undermine the \r\nability of Arab citizens of Israel and their parliamentary \r\nrepresentatives to take part in the political life of the \r\ncountry, penalize political expression or acts that \r\nchallenge the Jewish or Zionist character of the State \r\nand give priority to Jewish citizens when State resources \r\nare being allocated. According to a recent report of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \r\npresented to the Special Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People, the \r\noccupation imposes high costs on the economy of the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory.\r\nThe Security Council cannot continue to shirk its \r\nresponsibility or ignore the support of the majority \r\nof the States Members of the United Nations for the \r\nPalestinian cause. The Security Council must shoulder \r\nits responsibility and overcome its silence and paralysis \r\non the issue. A serious historic responsibility falls to \r\nit, particularly to some of its permanent members. A \r\ndefinitive response that rejects the policy of building \r\nsettlements in the occupied Palestinian territory, which \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 5/32\r\nis threatening the two-State solution, as outlined by \r\nthe Quartet in its July 2016 report, is the only path to \r\nlasting peace. It takes into account Israel’s security \r\nneeds and Palestinian aspirations of sovereignty and \r\nindependence and could end the occupation that began \r\nin 1967.\r\nOnce again, we urge Israel — a State member of the \r\ninternational community that was born out of a decision \r\nby this Organization — to respect international law and \r\nthe opinion of the community of nations, which, year \r\nafter year, calls for an end to the policy of expansion \r\nand the building of settlements. As our delegation \r\nhas previously stated, the question of Palestine is an \r\neminently political conflict that requires a political \r\nsolution. Its basis lies in the right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to self-determination and depends on an overall \r\nsolution to the problem of the Middle East. The region \r\nhas already been the battleground for four wars and, \r\nnow more than ever, the present conflict is one of the \r\nmost serious threats to international peace and security.\r\nThe bilateral formula for the quest for peace is direct \r\nnegotiations between Israelis and Palestinians. Such \r\nnegotiations have been supported by the international \r\ncommunity but regrettably have not yielded any results \r\nor progress. Seventy years of waiting is quite enough. \r\nUnfortunately, we believe that this path has been \r\nexhausted. That is why our delegation values and voices \r\nits support for the various recent initiatives that have \r\nemerged recently to promote the peace process between \r\nIsrael and Palestine, such as the French and Egyptian \r\ninitiative, and Russia’s more recent proposal to host a \r\nmeeting of Israeli and Palestinian leaders.\r\nThis legally organized community has a duty and a \r\ndebt to return the rights of the Palestinian people to them \r\nand finalize the establishment of an independent State \r\nof Palestine as a full Member of the United Nations, as \r\nwas established in the 1947 partition plan (see resolution \r\n181 (II)). My delegation would like to firmly reiterate \r\nonce again the support of the Government and people \r\nof Ecuador for the legitimate right of the Palestinian \r\npeople to establish an independent State with the1967 \r\nborders, with East Jerusalem as its capital. Next year, \r\n2017, should be the year the foreign occupation of the \r\nPalestinian territory comes to an end.\r\nI will conclude with another quotation from Fidel \r\nCastro. He spoke these words in the General Assembly \r\nHall — at this very rostrum — in 1979, as he made a \r\nstatement on behalf of the Movement of Non-Aligned \r\nCountries:\r\n“From the bottom of our heart, we repudiated \r\nthe merciless persecution and genocide that the \r\nNazis once visited on the Jews, but there is nothing \r\nin recent history that parallels it more closely than \r\nthe dispossession, persecution and genocide that \r\nimperialism and Zionism are currently practicing \r\nagainst the Palestinian people. Pushed off their \r\nland, expelled from their own country, scattered \r\nthroughout the world, persecuted and murdered, the \r\nheroic Palestinians are a vivid example of sacrifice \r\nand patriotism, living symbols of the most terrible \r\ncrime of our era” (A/34/PV.31, para. 24).\r\nMr. Thammavongsa (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): As of today, the question of Palestine has \r\nbeen on the agenda of the United Nations for more than \r\nsix decades, and it is unfortunate that the Palestinian \r\npeople still have no glimmer of hope that their right to \r\nself-determination that will lead to the establishment of \r\nan independent State of Palestine will be realized. It is \r\ntherefore time for the international community to take \r\nbold steps to create favourable conditions for the return \r\nby all parties concerned to dialogue and negotiations in \r\norder to resolve this protracted conflict and realize the \r\ntwo-State solution so that Palestine and Israel can live \r\nside by side in peace.\r\nWe are concerned about the dire humanitarian \r\nsituation in the Gaza Strip following the war in 2014. \r\nAt their current rate, efforts to address humanitarian \r\nneeds and rebuild homes to improve the livelihoods \r\nof tens of thousands of Palestinian people affected by \r\nthe war are insufficient due to the blockade, severe \r\nimport restrictions and unfulfilled donor pledges. My \r\ndelegation therefore calls for the lifting of the blockade \r\nand urges the international community to provide \r\nsupport and aid to Palestine so that the humanitarian \r\nassistance and reconstruction process can be expedited. \r\nIn addition, the continued illegal settlement activities \r\nand destruction of properties, homes and economic \r\ninstitutions in the occupied territory have led to the \r\nfurther deterioration of the already grave socioeconomic \r\nsituation that the Palestinian people are facing.\r\nThis constitutes a breach of international law, \r\nincluding international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights law, and acts as an impediment to the peace \r\nprocess and opportunities for negotiations. Such \r\nacts should therefore be stopped in order to create a \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n6/32 16-40731\r\nconducive environment for the parties concerned to \r\nreturn to the negotiating table and find a just and lasting \r\nsolution to the long-overdue question of Palestine. This \r\nsolution must be based on United Nations resolutions \r\nand the Quartet road map, which envisage a sovereign, \r\nindependent and viable State of Palestine with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital, living side by side in peace with \r\nthe State of Israel, within secure and internationally \r\nrecognized borders.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic has long \r\nrecognized the State of Palestine and wishes to reaffirm \r\nits consistent support for the Palestinian people in \r\nattaining their long-delayed goal of a viable, peaceful \r\nand prosperous State of Palestine that is a full-f ledged \r\nMember of the United Nations. We welcome other \r\ncountries’ decisions to recognize the State of Palestine \r\nand hope that more will do so in future. We believe that \r\nthe more recognition there is for the State of Palestine, \r\nthe more positive the contribution will be to expediting \r\na peaceful solution to this long-overdue issue.\r\nWhile waiting to see the full-f ledged, independent \r\nState of Palestine, we take this opportunity to commend \r\nthe role and work of the United Nations agencies, \r\nespecially the United Nations Relief and Works Agency \r\nfor Palestine Refugees in the Near East, for their \r\nsupport and assistance to the millions of Palestinian \r\npeople in need during all these year,s despite multiple \r\ndifficulties. We also wish the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople every success in its noble endeavours to achieve \r\na just, peaceful, comprehensive and lasting solution to \r\nthe question of Palestine.\r\nMr. Al Musharakh (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): At the outset, my delegation and I would \r\nlike to extend our sincere condolences to the people and \r\nthe Government of Cuba at the passing of the former \r\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Fidel Castro.\r\nI take this opportunity to reiterate the words of \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Khalifa Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, \r\nPresident of the United Arab Emirates, in his letter \r\naddressed to the Chair of the Committee on the Exercise \r\nof the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian people on \r\nthe occasion of the International Day of Solidarity with \r\nthe Palestinian People. In that letter, His Highness \r\naddressed the support of the United Arab Emirates for \r\nthe people and the Government of Palestine as they \r\nstrive to achieve their legitimate aspirations to establish \r\na sovereign and independent State such as those other \r\npeoples of the world enjoy.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates expresses its concern \r\nwith regard to the deteriorating humanitarian and \r\nsecurity and social situation in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory as well as to the escalation of violence and the \r\nabsence of a solution that would uphold the Palestinians’ \r\ninalienable rights, despite all the resolutions of and \r\nefforts by the United Nations, its agencies and other \r\nregional and international bodies to solve the Palestinian \r\nquestion. The tragedy of the Palestinian people has \r\ncontinued for 70 years. The United Arab Emirates \r\nbelieves that this international impotence will persist as \r\nlong as Israel continues with its illegitimate and illegal \r\npractices and its aggressive policies designed to oppress \r\nthe Palestinian people. Israel continues to destroy and \r\ndemolish Palestinian property, confiscate Palestinian \r\nlands and forcibly displace Palestinians, while using \r\nexcessive force against women and children.\r\nIn Gaza, Israel continues its inhumane embargo and \r\nblockade which has led to a deteriorating humanitarian \r\nsituation and to rising unemployment. Israel persists \r\nin its expanding its settlements, which is considered \r\nillegal and prohibited under international humanitarian \r\nlaw, having thus disregarded all international calls to \r\ncease these activities. These activities undermine the \r\ntwo-State solution and constitute an obstacle to the \r\npeace process in the Middle East.\r\nIn the light of this situation, settlers continue their \r\nviolence against the Palestinian people, while Israel \r\npersists in its exploitation of the natural resources \r\nof occupied Arab territories, including the Syrian \r\nGolan. Israel continues to take illegal measures to \r\nchange the character of Jerusalem. It persists in its \r\nsystematic attacks against Christian and Islamic holy \r\nsites, including the Al-Aqsa Mosque, in violation of \r\ninternational treaties.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates strongly condemns \r\nall Israeli violations and acts of oppression that run \r\ncounter to international human rights and humanitarian \r\nlaw and the fourth Geneva Convention of 1949. We call \r\non Israel to cease those violations and demonstrate \r\ngenuine political will towards achieving a true peace \r\nin the region. We denounce the continued Israeli \r\noccupation of Palestinian territories, as it threatens the \r\nstability and security of the region and plays into the \r\nhands of terrorist and extremist groups.\r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 7/32\r\nIt is high time for the international community to \r\nfulfil its legal, political and material responsibilities \r\nand compel Israel to immediately cease all its illegal \r\npractices. We call on the international community, \r\nthe Quartet and the Security Council to act decisively \r\nand immediately, in accordance with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the provisions of international \r\nlaw, to end the suffering of the Palestinian people, \r\ntake all necessary measures to salvage the two-State \r\nsolution and end the Israeli occupation of all Arab \r\nterritories, including the occupied Syrian Golan. We \r\nstress the need for the establishment of an independent \r\nPalestinian State along the borders of 4 June 1967, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance with \r\ninternational resolutions, the Arab Peace Initiative and \r\nthe Madrid Principles.\r\nMr. Alhakim (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, my delegation and I would like to express our \r\nsincere condolences to the people and the Government \r\nof Cuba at the passing of the former President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Fidel Castro.\r\nToday, on behalf of the President of Iraq, I \r\nwould like to deliver this statement addressed to the \r\nPalestinian people:\r\n“The International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People reflects and renews the global \r\nand ongoing responsibility of the international \r\ncommunity to address the Palestinian question as \r\nwell as its commitment to upholding the Palestinian \r\npeople’s legitimate rights in their just struggle for \r\nself-determination. It also reflects the need to \r\nend the unjust Israeli occupation of Palestinian \r\nterritory so that Palestinians can establish their \r\nown independent State, as other peoples of the \r\nworld have done.\r\n“The Republic of Iraq has long supported \r\naddressing the question of Palestine and its \r\npeople’s struggle to see their legitimate rights \r\nfulfilled. We are extremely concerned at the \r\nhumanitarian suffering of the Palestinian people \r\nas a result of Israel’s continued disregard for \r\ninternational resolutions and persistent, aggressive \r\nattacks on the Gaza Strip, in particular, resulting \r\nin disastrous consequences and the death and \r\ninjury of hundreds of civilians, including women, \r\nchildren and the elderly. Those attacks have also \r\ndestroyed infrastructure, schools — including \r\nschools administered by the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the \r\nNear East — and holy places.\r\n“Israel also continues to play out its expansionist \r\npolicy by building settlements in the heart of \r\nPalestinian cities in the West Bank, including in \r\nEast Jerusalem. Those practices have perpetuated \r\nthe suffering of the Palestinian people, who have \r\nlost all hope of seeing the establishment of a \r\ncomprehensive and just peace, given the continued \r\nIsraeli occupation of Palestinian territories since \r\n1967 and despite the passing of 24 years since the \r\nfirst round of negotiations between Israelis and \r\nPalestinians was undertaken.\r\n“On this International Day, the Republic of Iraq \r\nstresses that a comprehensive and just solution to \r\nthe Palestinian question is possible only through the \r\nestablishment of an independent State of Palestine, \r\na fully f ledged State, along the lines of the 4 June \r\n1967 borders, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nin accordance with the Arab Peace Initiative, the \r\ntwo-State solution and international resolutions, \r\nincluding the relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\n“We call on those countries that have yet to \r\nrecognize the State of Palestine, including European \r\ncountries, to recognize the State of Palestine, as the \r\nKingdom of Sweden has done. We call on them to \r\nsupport the aspirations of the Palestinian people \r\nto realize their legitimate rights, given that such \r\nrecognition would contribute to peace, security and \r\nstability in the Middle East.\r\n“The Republic of Iraq strongly condemns \r\nall Israeli attacks on Palestinian territory. We \r\nalso express our full support for the Palestinian \r\nAuthority and our solidarity with the Palestinian \r\npeople. We call on Arab countries and the \r\ninternational community to support the efforts of \r\nthe Palestinian National Authority in combating the \r\nnegative consequences of the Israeli occupation, \r\nespecially at the socioeconomic level, in the \r\noccupied territories and in Jerusalem. We call on \r\nthem to work together to strengthen national unity \r\nand create a united front, with a view to defending \r\nthe Palestinians’ legitimate rights.”\r\nMr. Elshandawily (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nIsraeli occupation of Palestine is now in its fiftieth \r\nyear. Occupation is by definition temporary, but when \r\nan occupation, such as that of Palestine by Israel, is \r\nmoving steadily towards semi-permanent status, it fuels \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n8/32 16-40731\r\nthe continuation of a conflict that is now the oldest and \r\nmost dangerous in the Middle East. It erodes prospects \r\nfor coexistence and mutual respect. As described by the \r\nSecretary-General, it has turned the region into a fertile \r\nground for hatred and extremism.\r\nThe international community has continuously \r\nadvocated for a solution to the question of Palestine \r\nthat upholds the Palestinian people’s legitimate \r\nright to self-determination and the aspirations of the \r\nPalestinian and Israeli peoples to live in peace as equals \r\nin two independent States, side by side, on the basis of \r\ninternational resolutions, within the borders of 4 June \r\n1967. However, today, 23 years after the Oslo Accords, \r\ninstead of witnessing the birth of a sovereign Palestinian \r\nState in accordance with resolutions and international \r\nlegitimacy, we are witnessing the establishment of a \r\ncozy State of illegal settlements — a cozy State inhabited \r\nby more than half a million settlers — expanding over \r\nPalestinian territories and enjoying the official support \r\nof the occupying Power. That occupying Power has \r\nspared no effort over the past 10 years to confiscate \r\nland, demolish homes and displace Palestinians, and \r\nhas been supported by the inaction of the international \r\ncommunity and the passive stances of influential \r\ninternational Powers that have the ability to stop such \r\nillegal actions.\r\nMaintaining the status quo represents a pulling back \r\nfrom the objectives of the United Nations. It encourages \r\nfurther deterioration on the ground, the consequences \r\nof which are hard to predict. I would like to stress here \r\nthat it is a false notion that what we are doing here at the \r\nUnited Nations is a foregone conclusion. Over a period \r\nof years, our meetings in the General Assembly on this \r\nagenda item and the resolutions we have adopted have \r\nbeen the only way to officially document Palestinian \r\nrights and duties within the United Nations, which \r\nshould remain, with regard to any political accounting, \r\nthe legal protector of the right of Palestinians to their \r\nindependent State within the borders of June 1967 \r\nand with Jerusalem as its capital. Furthermore, our \r\nmeetings in the General Assembly and our adoption of \r\nsuch resolutions are testimony to the fact that Arabs \r\nand Palestinians should choose the path of peace.\r\nI would therefore like to thank all those who \r\ncontinue to support international legitimacy by voting in \r\nfavour of United Nations resolutions and ascribe blame \r\nto all those that voted against them. I would ask the \r\nlatter group the following question: If they are against \r\nthe principle of maintaining Palestinian rights through \r\ninternational, United Nations resolutions, what is the \r\nbest way to maintain, restore and protect their rights \r\nfrom erosion caused by the policy of maintaining the \r\nstatus quo? It is clear that those parties are responsible \r\nfor the delay in resolving the question of Palestine. \r\nIndeed, it is the lack of will of major international \r\nPowers that is impeding a solution. Nevertheless, this \r\nsituation should not make us forget the central role of \r\nthe United Nations and its bodies, nor should it cause \r\nus to deviate from the path chartered by international \r\nlegitimacy and the terms of references.\r\nIn a Arria Formula meeting on 14 July 2016, \r\nmembers of the Security Council heard statements \r\nfrom people all over the world, including from the \r\nUnited States, Belgium and Israel itself. It was stressed \r\nonce again at that meeting that the Israeli settlements \r\nwere not just an obstacle to peace and to the two-State \r\nsolution, but rather the core and crux of the crisis. The \r\nPalestinian cause is mainly the issue of a land that has \r\nbeen forcibly occupied. It is the cause of a people that \r\nhas been stripped of its right to live in dignity.\r\nAlso highlighted at that meeting was something \r\nworth recognizing and valuing, namely, the Israeli \r\nvoices calling for peace. Those voices are aware that \r\nit is impossible for the occupation to continue, or for \r\ncoexistence to be viable, in the light of attempts to \r\nimpose a status quo. It is impossible to achieve the goal \r\nof peace when laws are applied in a discriminatory \r\nmanner. Those voices spoke out against the imposition \r\nof a policy of maintaining the status quo and abandoning \r\nthe two-State solution. They are the voices of those who \r\nknow that a people cannot live at the expense of another \r\npeople. Thanks to what we heard, I am fully confident \r\nthat the Israeli call within the United Nations for peace \r\nis an expression of the genuine desire of a significant, \r\nif not the largest, segment of the Israeli people. We, as \r\nEgyptians and Arabs, are resolved to cooperate with \r\nthat segment of the Israeli population and will continue \r\nto work towards a just and comprehensive peace in \r\nthe region.\r\nEgypt remains committed to the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative and to encouraging efforts by the international \r\ncommunity to resume negotiations between the \r\nPalestinians and the Israelis, particularly the efforts by \r\nFrance and Russia. Egypt is resolved to act bilaterally \r\nwithin a multilateral framework to enforce its vision for \r\npeace in the region. That vision, which was introduced \r\n37 years ago at the conclusion of the peace treaty \r\nbetween Egypt and Israel, can still be implemented if \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 9/32\r\nwe garner the necessary international will and if Israel \r\nopts for a just, comprehensive peace for itself and other \r\ncountries of the region.\r\nMs. Danish (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nOn behalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia, I would like to take this opportunity to thank \r\nthe President for making it possible for us to take part in \r\ntoday’s discussion of the Palestinian question. We will \r\nalways support the legitimate claim of our brothers, the \r\nPalestinian people, to recover their inalienable rights.\r\nOn this International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, we recall the tragedy that has \r\nbefallen them and caused their long-standing suffering. \r\nDespite the fact that the Palestinian question is the crux \r\nof the Middle East conflict and that there have been \r\nmany initiatives — including the Arab Peace Initiative, \r\nwhich my country launched 15 years ago — the \r\nPalestinian people remain deprived of their right to live \r\nin dignity and to secure their freedom and right to self-\r\ndetermination.\r\nIsrael continues to be in breach of international \r\nlaw, pursues illegitimate and illegal policies, especially \r\nits settlement activities, violates the sanctity of holy \r\nsites and blocks peace efforts. We therefore call on \r\nthe international community to dissuade Israel from \r\ncarrying out such coercive policies, which defy the will \r\nof the international community and hinder efforts aimed \r\nat reaching a successful conclusion to negotiations.\r\nMs. Young (Belize), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nMy country is dedicated to a lasting peace. The \r\nsuccess of the peace process depends upon the complete \r\nand final withdrawal of Israel from the Palestinian \r\nterritories, the fulfilment of Palestinian people’s right \r\nto self-determination and the establishment of an \r\nindependent State with East Jerusalem as its capital. \r\nWe should put an end to the tragedy endured by the \r\nPalestinian people. My country supports the efforts by \r\nthe Palestinian Authority, under President Mahmoud \r\nAbbas, as well as international efforts to protect the \r\nPalestinian people, and especially to preserve the \r\nIslamic and Arab character of Jerusalem.\r\nMr. Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I would like \r\nto thank the President for convening today’s meeting, \r\nand the Chair of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People for the \r\nstatement delivered on his behalf (see A/71/PV.49). We \r\nare also grateful to the Committee itself for its efforts. \r\nWe take this opportunity to affirm the indivisibility \r\nof Palestinian rights and to welcome the special \r\ninformation programme on the question of Palestine \r\nsponsored by the Department of Public Information.\r\nThe Middle East faces many challenges as a result \r\nof the increasing number of crises and conflicts in \r\nthe region. Those crises and conflicts are negatively \r\naffecting the people of the region and are undermining \r\ntheir fundamental rights, well-being and development, \r\nwith disastrous effects across the world. Stability and \r\npeace must therefore be achieved in the region by \r\naddressing the root causes of the crises, particularly the \r\nunsuccessful efforts to counter the grave violations of \r\ninternational law and resolutions and the failure to ensure \r\nequity and justice — a problem that must be addressed \r\nif we are to achieve a lasting, comprehensive peace by \r\nending the Israeli occupation of Arab territories.\r\nThe seven decades of occupation have proved \r\nthat there can be no peace or stability in the region \r\nby imposing a fait accompli. We therefore welcome \r\nthe initiative of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People to proclaim \r\nthe year 2017 as the International Year to End Israeli \r\nOccupation of Palestine, including East Jerusalem. The \r\ninitiative is based on realistic and legal grounds that \r\nwould defuse the tension between the two parties. \r\nWe reaffirm our condemnation of all practices \r\nundertaken by Israel, the occupying Power, against \r\nholy sites, Islamic and Christian, in Jerusalem, as \r\nwell as attempts to change the situation at the Al-Aqsa \r\nMosque and to impose restrictions on Muslims entering \r\nthat site. We welcome the decision of the UNESCO \r\nExecutive Board on occupied Palestine. in October, \r\nand the separate decision of the World Heritage \r\nCommittee, which both proclaim Al-Ḥaram Al-Sharif \r\nto be an integral part of a world cultural heritage site \r\nwith historic value that Israel is obligated to protect.\r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions in that regard reflect \r\nthe commitment of the international community \r\nto compel Israel, the occupying Power, to cease \r\nits unilateral activities in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including East Jerusalem, that seek to change \r\nthe demographic character of the city. All of those \r\nresolutions stress the illegality of Israeli practices \r\nthat seek to impose its laws and legislation on East \r\nJerusalem. The resolutions also confirm the invalidity \r\nof the Israeli occupation of the Syrian Golan and call on \r\nIsrael to fully withdraw to the 1967 borders.\r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n10/32 16-40731\r\nIt is time to reach a just, comprehensive and lasting \r\nsolution based on the United Nations resolutions, the \r\nMadrid terms of reference and the two-State solution, \r\nwhich seeks to create two States, Israel and Palestine, \r\nliving side by side in peace and within the recognized \r\nand secure 1967 borders. Israel must therefore withdraw \r\nfrom land occupied by Palestinians in 1967 and ensure \r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people, particularly their \r\nright to self-determination and to the establishment \r\nof their own independent State, while reaching a just \r\nsolution to the refugee crisis, pursuant to resolution \r\n194 (III), of 11 December 1948. Negotiations must be \r\nresumed, in keeping with the relevant mandates and \r\nfollowing a clear timetable, so as to bring about a just, \r\ncomprehensive and lasting solution.\r\nThe escalating violence on the ground is the \r\nresult of the illegal Israeli occupation, the use of \r\nexcessive force against the Palestinians and the crimes \r\ncommitted by Israeli settlers against Palestinians with \r\nfull impunity. We should therefore not be surprised \r\nthat Palestinians are protesting all those measures, \r\nas they violate their rights and diminish any prospect \r\nof the establishment of their own independent State. \r\nAccordingly, the international community must provide \r\ninternational protection for the Palestinian people \r\nwhile implementing and enforcing Security Council \r\nresolutions, in particular resolutions 605 (1987) and 904 \r\n(1994), on the applicability to the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritories of the Geneva Convention relative to the \r\nProtection of Civilian Persons in Time of War.\r\nThe continued, unjust blockade of the Gaza \r\nStrip, which denies the people of Gaza their basic \r\nnecessities, together with the restrictions imposed \r\non the entry of goods and services to the Strip, has \r\nhad disastrous humanitarian effects and impedes the \r\npeace process. Qatar is aware of the need to improve \r\nthe humanitarian situation in the Gaza Strip. We will \r\ntherefore continue our humanitarian efforts and work to \r\nassist in the reconstruction of the Strip. In that respect, \r\nQatar recently inaugurated schools in the Gaza Strip \r\nnamed for His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad \r\nAl-Thani, and we will continue our efforts towards \r\nPalestinian reconciliation.\r\nThe international community is currently \r\nfocused on achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). However, the policies imposed by the \r\noccupying Power impede the ability of the Palestinian \r\npeople to achieve the SDGs. According to a report of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Trade and Development, \r\nthe Palestinian economy is suffering as a result of the \r\nIsraeli occupation. There should be a comprehensive, \r\nlasting and evidence-based mechanism within the \r\nUnited Nations system to determine the amount of \r\nthose economic losses.\r\nIn conclusion, the State of Qatar renews its full \r\nsupport for the Palestinian people and for all efforts \r\naimed at achieving a lasting, comprehensive and just \r\npeace in the Middle East.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\nquestion of Palestine, which is at the core of the situation \r\nin the Middle East, remains an issue of fundamental \r\nimportance for peace in the region. The international \r\ncommunity should have a greater sense of urgency in \r\nresolving the Palestinian question, and concrete efforts \r\nshould be made to promote a just and complete solution \r\nto the issue. Such a solution is in the interests of the \r\npeoples of the Middle East, including Palestinians, and \r\ncan help promote peace and stability in the world.\r\nThe Palestinian-Israeli peace talks are now deeply \r\nmired in an impasse, even as violent conflicts continue. \r\nThe humanitarian situation is dire. The international \r\ncommunity must not just let the Palestinian people \r\nsuffer, nor should it allow the Middle East peace process \r\nto stall. Concerted efforts should be made to resolve the \r\nPalestinian question. China calls upon the international \r\ncommunity to make efforts in the following ways.\r\nFirst, it should adhere to the path leading towards \r\nboth the establishment of an independent Palestinian \r\nState and the peaceful coexistence of Palestine \r\nand Israel. That should be done on the basis of the \r\nprinciple of land for peace, the two-State solution, the \r\nArab Peace Initiative and the relevant United Nations \r\nresolutions. The international community should \r\npromote the early resumption of the peace talks for \r\nreal, concrete outcomes.\r\nSecondly, the international community should urge \r\nPalestine and Israel to exercise restraint and put an end to \r\nviolent conflicts. Israel should demonstrate its sincerity \r\nfirst by ceasing the construction of settlements and \r\nthe demolition of Palestinian homes in order to create \r\nconditions for the resumption of peace talks. In the \r\nmeantime, attention should be given to the legitimate \r\nsecurity concerns of the countries of the region.\r\nThirdly, the international community should provide \r\na guarantee for the Middle East peace process. It should \r\nexplore a broader scope for peacebuilding efforts and \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 11/32\r\ndevelop more effective peace-promoting mechanisms \r\nfor issues relating to the Middle East. The General \r\nAssembly should urge the relevant Member States to \r\nconcretely implement Assembly resolutions regarding \r\nthe Palestinian question. The Security Council should \r\ntake swift action and actively respond to the legitimate \r\nconcerns of Palestine and the Arab States.\r\nFourthly, the international community should press \r\nahead with the economic reconstruction of Palestine \r\nand strengthen economic aid and support for it, in order \r\nto alleviate its humanitarian situation.\r\nChina is a staunch supporter of the just cause of \r\nthe Palestinian people. At the meeting commemorating \r\nthe International Day of Solidarity with the Palestinian \r\nPeople yesterday (see A/AC.183/PV.380), President Xi \r\nJinping sent a message that expressed China’s sympathy \r\nand support for the Palestinian people. President Xi \r\nJinping emphasized the fact that China supports the \r\nestablishment of an independent Palestinian State with \r\nfull sovereignty on the basis of pre-1967 borders, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, as well as Palestine’s \r\nincreased participation in international affairs in its \r\ncapacity as a State. As a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council, China is ready to work with the \r\ninternational community towards the early realization \r\nof a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the \r\nMiddle East.\r\nAt present, the Middle East is still experiencing \r\nwars and conflicts caused by intertwined hotspot \r\nissues and the spread of terrorism. The international \r\ncommunity should work together for peace and stability \r\nin the region, which is in the interests of all parties.\r\nFirst, the international community should respect \r\nthe rights of the countries and peoples in the region \r\nto choose their own political systems and pathways \r\nof development. It should encourage parties to resolve \r\ndifferences through inclusive political dialogue.\r\nSecondly, in dealing with Middle East affairs, the \r\ninternational community should uphold the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nIt should respect the independence, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of States and observe widely \r\nrecognized basic principles of international relations.\r\nThirdly, the international community should help \r\nthe region of the Middle East improve the well-being \r\nof its people, develop a culture of tolerance, strive for \r\nharmonious coexistence and address the root causes of \r\nregional turmoil.\r\nFourthly, it should enhance coordination, tackle \r\nboth symptoms and root causes, apply unified standards \r\nand steadfastly crack down on regional terrorist \r\nforces in order to prevent the development and spread \r\nof terrorism.\r\nTogether with the international community, China \r\nis ready to make its contribution to finding a way \r\nout of the difficult situation in the Middle East, thus \r\nenabling the early realization of peace and development \r\nin the region.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): First of \r\nall, I wish to thank the Committee on the Exercise of \r\nthe Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and its \r\nChair, Ambassador Fodé Seck, for the efforts to support \r\nthe rights of the Palestinian people.\r\nMy delegation has taken note of the report of \r\nthe Committee covering the period from October \r\n2015 to October 2016 (A/71/35), which recounts the \r\ndeterioration of the humanitarian and security situation \r\nin the Palestinian territories, including East Jerusalem, \r\nwhich is a cause of concern. The report has considered \r\nand specified initiatives to relaunch the peace process. \r\nThose are initiatives that we fully support in order \r\nto dispel the impasse blocking the Palestinian cause. \r\nThose initiatives would also help the Palestinian people \r\nto live in dignity and create an independent State within \r\nthe pre-1967 borders, making it possible for them \r\nto live side by side with Israel in peace and security. \r\nMy delegation has also taken note of the report of the \r\nSecretary-General (A/71/359).\r\nThe marking of the International Day of Solidarity \r\nwith the Palestinian People has been an opportunity for \r\nthe King Mohamed VI to pledge to the Chair of the \r\nCommittee on the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople — and through the Committee to the Palestinian \r\npeople and its leadership, headed by President \r\nMahmoud Abbas — the full and ongoing support of \r\nthe Kingdom of Morocco for the historic and legitimate \r\nrights of the Palestinian people, in particular the right \r\nto establish, within the borders of 4 June 1967, and with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital, a viable, independent State \r\nliving by side by side with Israel in peace and security \r\nand in accordance with the resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy. His Majesty has also specified that:\r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n12/32 16-40731\r\n“Given the obstacles that are impeding the \r\ncreation of a Palestinian State, our message \r\ntoday — in view of the uncertain and confused \r\ninternational and regional situation — is that we \r\nmust heighten the international community’s \r\nawareness with respect to its duty towards the \r\nPalestinian people, given Palestinians’ ongoing \r\nand increasing suffering due to the intransigence \r\nof the other party, a party which continues its \r\nsettlement activities and its aggressions in Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif and does everything to undermine the \r\ntwo-State solution.”\r\nHis Majesty King Mohammed VI, who chairs the \r\nAl-Quds Committee, is following with deep concern \r\nthe escalation in violence and the practices adopted \r\nby Israel in Palestine, especially in Jerusalem, aimed \r\nat destroying the legal status of the holy city, as \r\nset forth in resolutions of international legitimacy, \r\nwhich consider Jerusalem to be an integral part of \r\nthe Palestinian territories occupied since 1967. Those \r\npractices — including recurring acts of systematic \r\naggression, perpetrated in the esplanades of Al-Aqsa \r\nmosque — seek to conflate the Palestinian cause with \r\nsectarian conflict and to make Jerusalem disintegrate \r\nin space and in time.\r\nIn his message, His Majesty expressed our \r\ncommitment to support peace, security, equity and \r\nstability in Palestine. We will spare no effort to \r\npreserve the rights of the Palestinians in that city. We \r\nwill defend the legal status of the city using political, \r\nlegal and diplomatic means. We will do everything \r\npossible and use every necessary means so that the \r\nAl-Quds Fund — the right hand of the Al-Quds \r\nCommittee — succeeds in realizing the socioeconomic \r\nprojects to strengthen the resilience of the Palestinians, \r\nto enable them to live in dignity and to preserve the \r\nheritage of that city, which is a symbol par excellence \r\nof coexistence and tolerance.\r\nThe only way to resolve the question of Palestine \r\nis to return to the negotiating table in good faith within \r\na specified time frame with a view to achieving the \r\ntwo-State solution, each living side by side in peace, \r\nsecurity, harmony and cooperation.\r\nMorocco maintains its principled position, based \r\non the Arab Peace Initiative, with regard to the \r\nachievement of peace based on the establishment of \r\nan independent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital, within the borders of 4 June 1967. The \r\ninternational community is therefore called on, now \r\nmore than ever, to revive the peace process within a \r\nspecific time frame and on the basis of international \r\nlegitimacy. Morocco is more than willing to engage \r\npositively in all initiatives that will push forward the \r\npeace process with a view to reaching a settlement that \r\nwill ensure security and stability in the region.\r\nMr. Uddin (Bangladesh): Bangladesh joins \r\nthe international community in reaffirming its \r\ncommitment to the rights of the Palestinian people \r\nto self-determination and independence. Bangladesh \r\nsupports the cause of an independent, viable and united \r\nPalestinian State on the basis of the pre-1967 borders, \r\nwith East Jerusalem as its capital. On the International \r\nDay of Solidarity with the Palestinian People, our Prime \r\nMinister Sheikh Hasina urged all concerned parties “to \r\ntake a pragmatic approach and work together for the \r\nattainment of the legitimate rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople”. \r\nWe appreciate the Secretary General’s report \r\n(A/71/359), reflecting his abiding commitment to \r\nresuming negotiations on the Palestinian question. \r\nWe believe that the new Secretary-General will also \r\nremain seized of the issue of restoring the political \r\nhorizon for the negotiations to take off. We remain \r\nmindful of the Middle East Quartet’s efforts to assess \r\nthe situation on the ground in order to move ahead with \r\nthe peace process.\r\nThe year 2017 will mark the fiftieth anniversary \r\nof the occupation of the Palestinian territories. That \r\nshould be an occasion for mobilizing the necessary \r\npolitical will of all concerned for meaningful peace \r\ninitiatives. The immediate priority for the international \r\ncommunity should be to send out a clear message on \r\nputting an end to Israeli settlement activities in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territories. The illegal Israeli \r\nsettlements have been rightly identified as the main \r\nobstacle to a two-State solution.\r\nThe Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip is about to \r\nenter its tenth year. The humanitarian and socioeconomic \r\nsituation there remains an urgent matter of concern. \r\nWe call upon the international community to impress \r\nupon Israel, the occupying Power, to halt its systematic \r\nviolation of international humanitarian law and human \r\nrights principles. We reiterate that the implementation \r\nof the relevant United Nations resolutions, the Quartet’s \r\nroad map, the Arab Peace Plan and the principle of \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 13/32\r\nland for peace remains critical to achieving a durable \r\nsolution to the Palestinian question.\r\nBangladesh supports the Palestinian delegation’s \r\ninterest in playing an enhanced role in the United Nations. \r\nWe shall continue to support the work of the relevant \r\nUnited Nations entities and committees in promoting \r\nand protecting the rights of the Palestinian people.\r\nMs. Stener (Norway): The efforts to resolve \r\nthe conflict by establishing two States living side by \r\nside in peace and security remain at an impasse. We \r\nmust strive to safeguard two decades of investment in \r\nbuilding the foundations for the two-State solution. \r\nThe parties need to increase their efforts to make that a \r\nreality. We know what steps are required. All unilateral \r\nactions that undermine the political process and turn \r\nhope into confrontation must stop. The expansion and \r\nlegalization of settlements must stop. Violence and \r\nincitement to violence must stop.\r\nNorway, as the Chair of the Ad Hoc Liaison \r\nCommittee for the Coordination of the International \r\nAssistance to Palestinians, the donor group for Palestine, \r\nsees some positive signs. The Committee’s meeting in \r\nNew York on 19 September was the most constructive \r\nmeeting in years. The Palestinian Authority and Israel \r\nreached an agreement on the electricity sector, and \r\nimportant progress has been made this year on fiscal \r\nissues. The two parties agreed on key infrastructure \r\nprojects in Gaza. \r\nThat way forward also warrants the full cooperation \r\nof the donors. The Palestinian Authority will not be able \r\nto close the current financial gap by itself. Continued \r\nbudget support is needed, also to enable reform. Norway \r\nis actively working with the parties and the donors to \r\nfollow up on the results from September. When the \r\nAd Hoc Liaison Committee meets again in Brussels in \r\nthe spring, we must make sure that the electricity-debt \r\nagreement has reached its implementation phase, and \r\nthat the parties have made serious progress on water \r\nand energy.\r\nThe Palestinian Authority needs to reform and \r\nstrengthen its political institutions and governance \r\nstructures. The West Bank and Gaza need to be \r\nreintegrated into one authority that fully respects the \r\nparameters of the security agreements between Israel \r\nand the Palestine Liberation Organization. \r\nThe situation in Gaza is of great concern. \r\nDeveloping Gaza in an effective manner must remain \r\na top priority. Reconstruction must be accelerated. The \r\nvolume of imported construction material, including \r\ncement, through the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism \r\nneeds to be increased. The entry of construction \r\nmaterials through other channels is undermining the \r\nefforts to address dual-use and security problems in \r\nGaza.\r\nThe mandate and purpose of the Ad Hoc Liaison \r\nCommittee is to underpin such efforts to realize the \r\ntwo-State solution. While progress on the economic \r\nfiles is no substitute for a political solution, the parties \r\nmust continue their cooperation in order to advance the \r\nPalestinian institutions and economy in preparation for \r\nindependence.\r\nMr. Sinirlioğlu (Turkey): I would like to start by \r\nextending our heartfelt condolences to the people and \r\nthe Government of Cuba for the passing away of former \r\nPresident Fidel Castro, who was a legendary leader. \r\nAt the outset, let me emphasize Turkey’s strong \r\nand long-standing commitment to the establishment of \r\na peaceful, stable and democratic environment that is \r\nrespectful of human rights and fundamental freedoms \r\nin the Middle East. It is unfortunate that the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian conflict remains the core challenge to \r\nattaining that goal. As the Secretary-General has said, \r\nwe should reaffirm our commitment to upholding the \r\nrights of the Palestinian people and working to build \r\na future of peace, justice, security and dignity for \r\nPalestinians and Israelis alike. \r\nThe historic injustice, continuing occupation and \r\nIsrael’s practices in contravention of international law, \r\nparticularly the systematic expansion of settlements, \r\nerode the viability of a two-State solution. House \r\ndemolitions, land confiscation, administrative \r\ndetentions, denying the Palestinians’ fundamental \r\nrights, and attempts to undermine the status and sanctity \r\nof Al-Haram Al-Sharif breed desperation and anger \r\namong the Palestinians, who have been collectively \r\npunished for decades. All of those actions combined \r\nweaken the possibility of peaceful coexistence. They \r\nfuel hatred, alienation and extremism in the region.\r\nIn order to overcome the current impasse, the \r\nPalestinian people should be able to sit at the negotiating \r\ntable as the State of Palestine on an equal standing with \r\nIsrael. In that regard, the recognition of the State of \r\nPalestine by more countries and its full integration into \r\ninternational institutions are vital. To reach a just and \r\nlasting peace, it is also crucial for the Palestinians to \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n14/32 16-40731\r\nvoice their legitimate demands in unity. In that regard, \r\nTurkey continues to encourage the Palestinian groups \r\nto move towards reconciliation and national unity. \r\nIn addition, empowering the Palestinian people and \r\nimproving their living conditions through development \r\nassistance and investments is more urgent than ever. \r\nTurkey will maintain its assistance programmes, in \r\nparticular those addressing the ongoing humanitarian \r\ncatastrophe in Gaza and the development needs of the \r\nWest Bank. \r\nWe all agree that prospects for lasting peace are \r\nfading away. The revitalization of the peace process is \r\nessential to granting lives of dignity to the Palestinian \r\npeople and to achieving stability in the region. With \r\nthe Israeli occupation approaching its fiftieth year, \r\nthe international community should uphold its \r\nresponsibility and renew its engagement in reaching \r\na negotiated political settlement based on the two-\r\nState solution, in accordance with international law, \r\nthe relevant United Nations resolutions and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative. Turkey will not cease its efforts for \r\na just and lasting settlement of the Palestinian issue, \r\nwith the establishment of a sovereign and independent \r\nPalestinian State within the pre-1967 borders, and with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nMr. Bultrikov (Kazakhstan): Kazakhstan attaches \r\ngreat importance to the Middle East region and \r\nconsistently strives for a political solution to the Israeli-\r\nPalestinian issue. We are seriously concerned by the \r\nabsence of real progress in the conflict, which impacts \r\nregional and international security. \r\nIn his latest report entitled “Assistance to the \r\nPalestinian people” (A/71/87), the Secretary-General \r\npoints out the negative trends on the ground, which \r\naccording to him make the two-State solution more \r\ndistant.  Kazakhstan is particularly concerned about \r\nthe gravity of the Palestinian situation and calls for \r\nurgent action by the international community towards \r\nits resolution in order to mitigate the suffering of \r\nPalestinians in all aspects of their existence. The \r\nblockades and checkpoints in Gaza, with little \r\nscope for economic survival, are worsening the \r\nsocioeconomic and humanitarian situation of the \r\nPalestinian population, causing relations to deteriorate \r\nand diminishing prospects for peace. \r\nThe settlement process and its rapid expansion in \r\nthe occupied territories not only aggravate the conflict \r\nbut also militate against all peace processes, as they \r\nhave denied the Palestinian people large parts of their \r\nterritories. The separation wall is an issue of contention \r\nbetween the two sides. We see the two-State solution, \r\nwith a return to the pre-1967 borders, as the only viable \r\noption for reaching a durable peace by dialogue, in \r\nkeeping with the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nrelevant Security Council resolutions. \r\nOther mechanisms and initiatives at the bilateral \r\nand multilateral levels, such as the road map for peace \r\nand the Arab Peace Initiative, should be harnessed. My \r\ndelegation urges the Middle East Quartet to pursue its \r\nmediation efforts, and calls on Israeli and Palestinian \r\nleaders to demonstrate political responsibility towards \r\nthe long-sought peace. We reiterate Kazakhstan’s \r\ncommitment to joining the multilateral effort to ensure \r\npeace and stability in the Middle East.\r\nMr. Elmajerbi (Libya) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to thank the Secretary-General for his report under \r\nthis agenda item (A/71/359) and the Chairman of the \r\nCommittee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People for the report in document \r\nA/71/35.\r\nIn order to resolve the question of Palestine, we \r\nmust first end the Israeli occupation of Palestine and \r\nthe Golan Heights. The international community has a \r\nresponsibility to force the Israeli occupation authorities \r\nto comply with United Nations resolutions and to \r\nrespect the historic rights of the Palestinian people, \r\nparticularly their rights to return, to self-determination \r\nand to create a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital. \r\nThe Israel occupation authorities now consistently \r\nf lout their obligations under international law. There \r\nis no need for us to list all of Israel’s practices, which \r\nare already documented by the United Nations, civil \r\nsociety organizations and the media. However, we \r\nrecall the war crimes committed against Gaza and in \r\nJerusalem. The frequent and excessive use of force \r\nagainst women and children, the practice of isolating \r\nPalestinian communities, settlement activities, crimes \r\ncommitted against Palestinians, the separation wall, \r\npolitical assassinations, expulsions, the expropriation \r\nof land and the destruction of houses and holy places are \r\nall f lagrant violations of human rights and international \r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nIsrael’s oppression of the Palestinian people and \r\nits annexation and Judaization policies seek to erase \r\nthe Arab identity from Jerusalem and are carried \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 15/32\r\nout systematically and on a recurring basis. The \r\noccupation authorities pursue their violations of the \r\nlegitimate rights of the Palestinian people and f lout \r\ninternational resolutions, particularly those adopted by \r\nthe Security Council. In this context, we commend the \r\ninternational community’s efforts to take all necessary \r\nmeasures to protect the Palestinian people; to put an \r\nend to settlement activities, which are changing the \r\nsituation on the ground, and to the Israeli occupation \r\nof Palestinian territories; and to recognize the State of \r\nPalestine as a full-f ledged State Member of the United \r\nNations.\r\nThe occupation authorities have imposed an unjust \r\nsiege on the Gaza Strip since 2007. This is a form of \r\ncollective punishment that threatens the lives of hundreds \r\nof thousands of Palestinians and violates international \r\nhumanitarian law. It is a siege that has had a negative \r\nimpact on the daily lives of the inhabitants of Gaza, \r\nwho suffer from the deterioration of infrastructure, a \r\nlack of medication and medical equipment, electricity \r\nshortages, high unemployment and a lack of drinking \r\nwater, not to mention the military agressions that \r\nhave killed or wounded hundreds of thousands of \r\nPalestinians, including women, children and the elderly. \r\nThe Israeli policy of expansion has not spared schools, \r\nespecially those run by the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, \r\nresulting in the displacement of thousands. \r\nMy country condemns the Israeli occupation of \r\nthe Syrian Golan and the activities carried out by the \r\noccupation forces against Syrian civilians in the Golan \r\nin an attempt to impose an Israeli identity on its Arab \r\ninhabitants. That constitutes a violation of international \r\nhumanitarian law and the Geneva Conventions. We \r\nbelieve that the necessary steps should be taken to \r\ncompel Israel to end its activities and comply with \r\nSecurity Council resolution 497 (1981).\r\nMr. Bouassila (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I thank the members of the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople for their comprehensive report (A/71/35) and \r\nwelcome the important recommendations contained \r\ntherein. I also thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nreport on the matter (A/71/359).\r\nThe General Assembly is meeting today to discuss \r\nthe Palestinian question at a time when the prospects \r\nfor a political solution seem to be growing ever more \r\nremote. We must aim for a solution that recognizes \r\nthe full rights of the Palestinian people on their lands, \r\nwhich have been occupied since June 1967, and to \r\nestablish their independent State with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital. \r\nWe stress that the inaction of the internatinal \r\ncommunity and its inability to find a just solution \r\nrepresent an utter failure of the contemporary world \r\norder. The international community has made repeated \r\ncalls for an end to the occupation, including through \r\nthe General Assembly and the League of Arab States, \r\nbut the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories \r\ncontinues. Israeli policies include the establishment \r\nof the apartheid wall, the displacement of Palestinian \r\ncivilians, the imposition of collective punishment and \r\nthe ongoing blockade of Gaza, whose people there are \r\nsuffering the impact of recent brutal aggressions that \r\nconstitute a complete violation of international law.\r\nIsrael’s lack of accountability for its brutal \r\noccupation allows it to pursue its daily violations of the \r\nhuman rights of the Palestinian people, including the \r\nexpansion of settlements and efforts to win acceptance \r\nfor them, violence by settlers, the exploitation of the \r\nnatural resources of the West Bank and Gaza, the \r\nmiserable state of detainees and prisoners in detention \r\ncentres and administrative detentions, the excessive use \r\nof force, extrajudicial killings, legislation proposing the \r\ndeportation of Palestinian families and the demolition \r\nof Palestinian houses, the forced displacement of \r\nnomads and herder communities in the West Bank \r\nand East Jerusalem, and the blockade of Gaza and the \r\npaucity of reconstruction there.\r\nOn this International Day of Solidarity with the \r\nPalestinian People, we recall that the Palestinian people \r\nhave the right to protection under international law \r\nand that Israel, as the occupying Power, is obliged to \r\nallow the Palestinian people to exercise that right in \r\nfull. Israel’s refusal to implement the Fourth Geneva \r\nConvention of 1949 in the Palestinian territories is a \r\nf lagrant act of defiance of the will of the internatinal \r\ncommunity, and yet it acts without fear of punishment. \r\nThose injust Israeli practices and continuous violations, \r\nin addition to the settlement and Judaization of Al-Quds \r\nAl-Sharif, are the main obstacle hindering the two-\r\nState solution, as stated in the recent Quartet report. \r\nThis ongoing situation and violations of the rights \r\nof the Palestinian people continue to serve as a reminder \r\nof the responsibility of the United Nations and the \r\ninternational community as a whole for the Palestinian \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n16/32 16-40731\r\npeople, who have been living under occupation for \r\nmore than half a century. This Day also serves as a \r\nreminder of the responsibility of the United Nations \r\nand the entire international community to provide them \r\nwith the protection they deserve and to bring pressure \r\nto bear on Israel to end that occupation. My delegation \r\nwelcomes the proposed designation of 2017 as the \r\ninternational year to end the Israeli occupation.\r\nIn conclusion, Algeria reiterates its firm and \r\nprincipled position in support of the Palestinian people \r\nand their just cause, and calls on the international \r\ncommunity and the United Nations to put an end to the \r\noccupying Power’s f lagrant violations and to intensify \r\ntheir efforts to enable the Palestinian people to establish \r\nan independent State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\non the territories that have been occupied since 1967.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. I should like to inform \r\nmembers that the consideration of draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.18, A/71/L.19, A/71/L.20 and A/71/L.21 will \r\ntake place following the conclusion of the debate on \r\nagenda item 34.\r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 35.\r\nAgenda item 34\r\nThe situation in the Middle East\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/71/328, \r\nA/71/328/Add.1 and A/71/359)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/71/L.8 and A/71/L.22)\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of Egypt to introduce draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.8 and A/71/L.22.\r\nMr. Elshandawily (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nworld is witnessing many humanitarian crises, most \r\nof them in the Middle East, which has been plagued \r\nby instability for many reasons. However, we must not \r\nforget that this instability arises historically from long \r\ndecades of injustice meted out to Arab peoples under \r\na seemingly indefinite occupation. Any attempt to \r\nuse the crises in the region as a pretext for diverting \r\nattention from the Israeli occupation of Arab territories \r\nis based on false claims that contravene the most \r\nbasic humanitarian principles and perpetuate illegal, \r\ninhumane situations. Those situations will continue \r\nto deteriorate as long as the occupation continues, and \r\nas long as we continue to condone the practices and \r\nviolations it inflicts on people who are supposed to \r\nbe able to enjoy the same rights as any other peoples \r\nin the world, especially the right to freedom, self-\r\ndetermination and a homeland.\r\nIn line with the international rejection of Israel’s \r\nillegal occupation and practices in the occupied Arab \r\nterritories, today I have the honour to introduce, on \r\nbehalf of the sponsors, two draft resolutions under \r\nagenda item 34, “The situation in the Middle East”. \r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.22, entitled “Jerusalem”, \r\nstresses that the relevant resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly and the Security Council are the main \r\nreference points for the issue, and that any measures \r\ntaken by Israel, the occupying Power, to impose its laws \r\nor administration on the city of Jerusalem are illegal \r\nand therefore null and void.\r\nThe international community has expressed \r\nits grave concern about Israel’s continued illegal \r\nsettlement activities, including those regarding the so-\r\ncalled E-1 plan and its construction of a separation wall \r\nin and around East Jerusalem that isolates the city from \r\nthe rest of the occupied Palestinian territory. In view of \r\nour desire for peace, and in order to protect Jerusalem’s \r\nreligious character, the draft resolution takes account \r\nof the legitimate concerns of both the Israelis and the \r\nPalestinians by emphasizing that a solution to the issue \r\nshould ensure freedom of religion for all of the city’s \r\ninhabitants, as well as access to the city’s holy sites for \r\npeople of all religions and nationalities. It also calls for \r\nrespect for the historical status quo in the city, in word \r\nand practice, including in the Haram al-Sharif.\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.8, on the Syrian Golan, \r\nsends an important message on behalf of the \r\ninternational community that despite the unprecedented \r\nhumanitarian crisis and conflict going on in Syria, \r\nthe world must not forget that a significant part of \r\nSyria’s territory is still under occupation. The draft \r\nresolution stresses the fact that despite the 35 years that \r\nhave elapsed since the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 497 (1981), Israel has yet to comply with its \r\nprovisions. It also stresses the fact that the Regulations \r\nannexed to the 1907 Hague Convention and the Fourth \r\nGeneva Convention of 1949 continue to apply to the \r\nSyrian territory occupied by Israel since 1967, and \r\ndeclares the invalidity of Israel’s decision to impose \r\nits laws on the Syrian Golan and the illegality of its \r\nsettlements. The draft resolution also calls on Israel to \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 17/32\r\nwithdraw completely from the Syrian Golan to the line \r\nof 4 June 1967.\r\nThe peoples of our region continue to suffer from \r\nwar and aggression and look forward to achieving \r\npeace, stability and coexistence. As the resolutions \r\nof the General Assembly show, those goals cannot be \r\nachieved without serious commitment and political \r\nwill on the part of Israel to fully withdrawing from \r\nall occupied Arab and Palestinian territories, in line \r\nwith the resolutions of the Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil and on the basis of the principle of land for \r\npeace and the standards of international law.\r\nOn behalf of Egypt and the sponsors, I hope that \r\nall Member States will support the draft resolutions, \r\nand I urge everyone to vote in their favour in order \r\nto demonstrate our solidarity and commitment to our \r\ninternational goals in upholding the noble purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMr. Mounzer (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): I thank the delegation of the Arab Republic \r\nof Egypt for introducing draft resolutions A/71/L.8 \r\nand A/71/L.22, entitled “The Syrian Golan” and \r\n“Jerusalem”, respectively. I would also like to thank the \r\nStates that have voted in favour of the resolution on the \r\nSyrian Golan in the past.\r\nEvery year, the General Assembly considers an \r\nagenda item on the situation in the Middle East, and \r\nhas done so since its twenty-fifth session, in 1970. \r\nEvery year, the Assembly calls on Israel to end its \r\noccupation of Arab territories, emphasizing that any \r\nmeasure taken by Israel, the occupying Power in the \r\nArab territories, to impose its laws and authority on \r\nJerusalem and the occupied Syrian Golan is unlawful, \r\nillegitimate and null and void. The Assembly’s \r\nresolutions on the subject consort perfectly with \r\nthe position unanimously expressed by the Security \r\nCouncil in its adoption of resolution 487 (1980), on \r\noccupied Jerusalem, and resolution 497 (1981), on the \r\nSyrian Golan. They rejected the Israeli occupation’s \r\nprovocative, unilateral decisions to annex Jerusalem \r\nand the Golan and considered them null and void, with \r\nno legal consequences.\r\nWe are once again debating this agenda item today, \r\n50 years after Israel’s occupation of Arab territories \r\nand in the face of severe lethargy on the part of the \r\ninternational community and Israel’s violation of \r\nPalestine’s holy sites. All of that is going on while \r\nIsrael is escalating its acts of aggression and settlement \r\nactivities through, for example, the proposed law on \r\nsettlement regularization, which is aimed at legitimizing \r\nthose colonies, and the law banning amplification of \r\nthe call to prayer in Jerusalem.\r\nIsrael’s occupation of the Syrian Golan is part \r\nof that sad picture. Israel has continued to refuse to \r\nrestore the Golan to Syria and to respect the resolutions \r\nof international law, particularly Security Council \r\nresolution 497 (1981). It continues to confiscate land \r\nin the occupied Golan and to pursue its settlement \r\nactivities, plundering the area’s resources, distorting \r\nhistorical realities, looting antiquities and laying mines. \r\nIt prevents Syrian citizens from pursuing educational \r\nprogrammes and deprives them of the right to be \r\nidentified as Syrian nationals and of the right to build \r\nhospitals in their own country.\r\nI cannot fail to mention, too, Israel’s policies \r\nof terrorism, repression, arbitrary detention, sham \r\nhearings and sentences, and ongoing aggressive, \r\nracist policies towards our brothers in the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan. We recently saw Israel’s military court \r\nsentence one young Syrian, Amal Abu Saleh, to seven \r\nyears and eight months in prison, and another, Bashira \r\nMahmoud, to 22 months because they blocked the path \r\nof an ambulance that was transporting two terrorists \r\nfrom the Al-Nusra Front and drove through the village \r\nof Majdal Shams in occupied Syria. Their sentences are \r\na demonstration of Israel’s involvement with terrorist \r\ngroups in Syria and its f lagrant violations of Security \r\nCouncil resolutions related to the fight against the \r\nterrorists of Da’esh and the Al-Nusra Front.\r\nWe also remind the international community of \r\nthe situation of Syria’s Mandela — the freedom fighter \r\nSedqi Al-Maqet. He was re-arrested by the Israeli \r\noccupation forces in March 2015, after 27 years in \r\nprison in Israel’s detention centres, because he exposed \r\nIsrael’s cooperation with the terrorists of the Al-Nusra \r\nFront in the area of separation. We urge that pressure be \r\nput on Israel to free without delay Sedqi Al-Maqet, Iyad \r\nAl-Johari and Amal Abu Saleh. We also call for Bashira \r\nMahmoud’s sentence to be revoked. The Government \r\nof Syria has appealed to the Secretary-General, the \r\nSecurity Council and other relevant entities to help \r\nachieve that humane goal. It seems that Mr. Mladenov \r\nis not aware of the serious situation of our citizens in \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan.\r\nSince those events in Syria began, Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, has added a new chapter to its record \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n18/32 16-40731\r\nof aggressions and violations of the separation of \r\nforces agreement and of Security Council resolutions, \r\nincluding those related to the fight against terrorism. We \r\nhave seen Israel’s support for armed terrorist groups in \r\nthe area of separation, including the Al-Nusra Front and \r\nDa’esh, which are blacklisted by the Security Council. \r\nIsrael has been in contact with both groups along \r\nthe ceasefire line and has facilitated their transit and \r\nmovement in the southern part of the area of separation \r\nand towards the north. Israel has clearly and blatantly \r\nprovided them with logistic and medical support and \r\nenabled them to return to Syrian territory so that they \r\ncan continue their terrorist activities there. That is done \r\nopenly and with the knowledge of the Department of \r\nPeacekeeping Operations, which has not lifted a finger \r\nto prevent it.\r\nWe can no longer tolerate the fact that the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations cooperate routinely \r\nand in solidarity with this occupying force, particularly \r\nafter the statement issued on 17 April by Israel’s Head of \r\nGovernment at the provocative Cabinet meeting held by \r\nthe occupying Power in the Golan, in which he said that \r\n“the Golan will always remain in Israel’s hands [and] \r\nIsrael will never withdraw from the Golan Heights”. \r\nWe have heard no comment, condemnation, rejection \r\nor reservation expressed by the Secretary-General, the \r\nSecretariat or the Security Council in response to such \r\nprovocations. \r\nHowever, the citizens of the occupied Syrian Golan \r\nare standing up to such daily declarations, which \r\nclearly and blatantly violate international law and \r\nUnited Nations resolutions, remaining attached to their \r\nSyrian Arab nationality and their loyalty to Syria and \r\nopposed to such practices and procedures on the part \r\nof Israel. The Syrian Golan is an integral part of the \r\nSyrian Arab Republic. Syrian Arab nationality is an \r\nunchanging criterion for us, passed down from father \r\nto son. Our lands are property sacred to the children \r\nof Syria and we do not recognize any Israeli decision \r\nthat aims to annex us to Israel. We categorically reject \r\nany resolutions or decisions of the Israeli Government \r\ndesigned to usurp our Syrian Arab identity.\r\nToday the Government of the Syrian Arab \r\nRepublic reaffirms that Syria’s sovereignty over the \r\noccupied Syrian Golan within the 1967 lines cannot be \r\nnegotiated or bargained over. Syria’s demands in the \r\npursuit of peace are not painful concessions. The lands \r\nthat have been usurped and violated must be returned \r\nto their legitimate owners. Sooner or later, the Israeli \r\ncolonizers must leave our lands in the Golan. \r\nIn that regard, the main question is, how long will \r\nIsrael remain above the law, evade accountability and \r\ncontinue its bellicose practices? The General Assembly \r\nmust take the necessary measures to contain Israel and \r\ncompel it to end the occupation of the Arab territories \r\nand withdraw from them, in line with pre-1967 borders, \r\ninstead of usurping that area. I call on States to support \r\ndraft resolutions A/71/L.8, on the Syrian Golan, and \r\nA/71/L.22, on Jerusalem. \r\nMs. AlDuraie (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, my delegation would like to express its support \r\nfor the Secretary-General for his efforts to strengthen \r\ninternational peace and security and his close monitoring \r\nof the situation in the Middle East. We welcome the \r\nreport of the Secretary-General in documents A/71/328 \r\nand Add.1 and support all international efforts aimed at \r\nlaying the foundation for regional security and stability. \r\nWe will continue to take part in all efforts that seek to \r\nstrengthen international peace and security.\r\nThe failed peace process in the Middle East is a \r\nmajor challenge for the international community. It \r\nref lects our paralysis in spite of the pressure that has \r\nbeen exerted on Israel for more than 60 years in an \r\nattempt to compel it to stop the settlement building \r\nand continued violations of the rights of Palestinians, \r\nwho remain the target of systematic acts of aggression. \r\nMy country offers its full support and solidarity to \r\nthe Palestinian people so that they can achieve their \r\naspirations to an independent Palestinian State with \r\nEast Jerusalem as it capital, in line with 4 June 1967 \r\nborders, the principle of land for peace and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative.\r\nWe again call on the international community to \r\ncompel Israel to implement Security Council resolution \r\n497 (1981), which calls on Israel to withdraw from \r\nthe occupied Syrian Golan. We support all measures \r\nundertaken by the fraternal Lebanese Republic aimed \r\nat preserving its stability, security, sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity. We stress the need for Israel to \r\ncease its continued violations of Lebanon’s sovereignty, \r\nwithdraw from all occupied territory and fully \r\nimplement Security Council resolution 1701 (2006). \r\nMy delegation is extremely concerned about the \r\nongoing crisis and bloody conflict in Syria, which \r\nis now in its sixth year. We are concerned about the \r\ndeteriorating humanitarian situation, the displacement \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 19/32\r\nof 13 million Syrians inside and outside of the country \r\nand the death of more than 300,000 people. Syrian \r\nrefugees make up the largest refugee community in the \r\nworld. \r\nIn that connection, we cannot ignore the situation in \r\nthe city of Aleppo. Statistics show that the humanitarian \r\nsituation continues to worsen. Two hundred and \r\nseventy-five thousand people are under siege in eastern \r\nAleppo. That is half of those besieged in Syria, for \r\nsome 582,000 people are under siege throughout the \r\ncountry. In that regard, once again, we condemn the \r\ndeliberate targeting of all residential areas, as well \r\nas civilian and medical infrastructure across Syria, \r\nincluding the indiscriminate use of barrels bombs and \r\ninternationally prohibited weapons. We stress the need \r\nfor all perpetrators of war crimes and crimes against \r\nhumanity to be brought to justice. \r\nThe State of Kuwait reiterates its support for United \r\nNations and other international efforts to reach a \r\npolitical solution in Syria, in line with Security Council \r\nresolution 2254 (2015), which sets a clear path to such \r\na solution based on the first Geneva Communiqué of \r\n2012 (S/2012/523, annex) and the Vienna statements \r\nregarding the establishment of a transitional governing \r\nbody with full executive powers to meet the legitimate \r\naspirations of the Syrian people to a life of freedom and \r\ndignity in a way that would preserve Syria’s stability, \r\nsovereignty and independence. \r\nIn that regard, in an effort to alleviate the suffering \r\nof the Syrian people, in 2013, 2014 and 2015 my \r\ncountry hosted three international donor conferences in \r\nsupport of humanitarian efforts there. My country has \r\npledged $1.3 billion, most of which has been disbursed \r\nto specialized agencies of the United Nations and other \r\nintergovernmental and non-governmental humanitarian \r\norganizations. My country also co-chaired the fourth \r\nconference of support for the humanitarian situation in \r\nSyria, which was held in London early this year.\r\nThe State of Kuwait supports the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General and his Special Envoy for Yemen, \r\nMr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed, to find a solution to the \r\ncrisis in Yemen in order to reach a consensus that would \r\nrestore security and stability in Yemen and end the \r\nbloodshed and the humanitarian suffering of the Yemeni \r\npeople, based on the three terms of reference — the \r\noutcome of the national dialogue, the Gulf initiative and \r\nits implementation mechanism — as well as relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, including resolution \r\n2216 (2015). We reiterate our rejection of all unilateral \r\nmeasures, including those announced by the Houthis \r\nand by the general public, to establish a Government \r\nof Salvation. We know that the Government of Yemeni \r\nPresident Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour is the \r\ninternationally recognized legitimate Government. \r\nKuwait reiterates its support for the security and \r\nstability of Yemen, which would preserve its sovereignty \r\nand its territorial integrity. We are committed to the \r\nYemeni political process and seek to ensure its success \r\nin line with the Security Council resolutions. In April, \r\nKuwait hosted the Yemeni peace negotiations under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations. We hope that those \r\nnegotiations will resume as soon as possible so that \r\nthe various Yemeni  parties can achieve peace and \r\nrestore stability and security in that Arab country, in \r\norder to move forward on the path to development and \r\nreconstruction.\r\nThe State of Kuwait reiterates its support to the \r\nIraqi Government. We commend Iraqi achievements \r\nin combating terrorism and Da’esh. We support all \r\nmeasures taken by the Government to preserve the \r\nsecurity, stability and territorial integrity of Iraq in \r\na way that would preserve security and safety of all \r\nsectors of the fraternal Iraqi people.\r\nWith regard to the disturbing situation in Libya, \r\nKuwait welcomes the efforts of the United Nations \r\nand the Presidency Council to implement the Libyan \r\nPolitical Agreement. We hope that such an agreement \r\nwill help the Libyan people preserve the security, \r\nstability and independence of their country.\r\nMr. Safronkov (Russian Federation) (spoke \r\nin Russian): Unfortunately, the situation in the \r\nMiddle East region, the cradle of world religions \r\nand civilizations, remains tense. The clashes on the \r\nWest Bank of the Jordan River, acts of terrorism and \r\noutbreaks of violence have led to the suffering of \r\nPalestinian civilians and the Israelis. The situation is \r\nworsening, with continued violations of the ceasefire \r\naround the Gaza Strip. Against the backdrop of the \r\ndeteriorating situation, we see  increasing radicalism \r\namong the Palestinian population, especially among \r\nyouth, and extremist views are increasing on both sides. \r\nWe strongly condemn any acts of violence, which whip \r\nup an already difficult atmosphere in the region and \r\ncause immense suffering to civilians, both in Israel and \r\nin the occupied Palestinian territories.\r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n20/32 16-40731\r\nWe are also concerned about the unilateral activities \r\nof Israel aimed at creating facts on the ground. The \r\nIsraeli authorities, in spite of the stern condemnations \r\nby the international community, continue to build and \r\nexpand settlements in the occupied territories, and at a \r\nrate that will enable them to reach a point of no return \r\nin the near future. We have noted with grave concern \r\nthe reports that a draft bill is under consideration by \r\nthe Knesset that would establish a procedure for the \r\nlegalization of outlying settlements and the various \r\nfacilities that have been built on private Palestinian \r\nland. The expropriation of land in the West Bank \r\narea continues, as does the destruction of Palestinian \r\nhomes. We are convinced that all of those activities \r\nonly undermine the realization of a two-State solution \r\naimed at solving the Palestinian problem. The Israelis, \r\nthe Palestinians and the international community all \r\nagree that there is no alternative to a two-State solution.\r\nThe conflict zone will be stabilized only if there are \r\nopportunities for a renewal of substantive talks on the \r\nbasis of generally recognized international decisions. \r\nIn order to overcome the deadlock in the peace process, \r\nthe body approved by Security Council, namely, the \r\nMiddle East Quartet of international negotiators, should \r\nbe actively engaged. On 1 July the Quartet issued its \r\nreport (S/2016/595, annex) on the situation with regard \r\nto the Palestine-Israel conflict settlement process, and \r\nit has become a landmark in the context of international \r\nefforts to find a Middle East settlement. \r\nThe report not only gives a real description of \r\nPalestinian-Israeli activities, but also includes concrete \r\nrecommendations aimed at safeguarding the prospects \r\nfor a two-State solution. We are convinced that sincere \r\nimplementation by the parties of those recommendations \r\nwill contribute to taking the situation out of its current \r\ndeadlock and to overcoming mutual distrust. However, \r\nquite frankly, we must recognize that the provisions \r\ncontained in the document are not being complied with. \r\nThat is shown by our assessment of the situation in the \r\nPalestinian territories.\r\nIn the context of international efforts to find a way \r\nout of the deadlock in the Middle East peace process, \r\nRussia has been carrying out a consistent policy with \r\nall the interested parties. We support intensive contacts \r\nwith participants in the conflict and with regional \r\nStates. We reaffirm that the invitation proffered to \r\nPresident Abbas and Prime Minister Netanyahu still \r\nremains in effect. Under the auspices of the President \r\nof the Russian Federation, Vladimir Putin, a meeting is \r\nto be held in Moscow to discuss optimal ways to find a \r\nway out of the deadlock in the peace process. We note \r\nthat the Palestinian and Israeli leaders have repeatedly \r\nreaffirmed their fundamental readiness to carry out \r\nsuch an initiative.\r\nWe call for the speedy restoration of Palestinian \r\nunity, based on the Palestine Liberation Organization’s \r\npolitical platform and the Arab Peace Initiative. With \r\nthe Palestinians working together, it will be much \r\neasier to fight for the realization of their legitimate \r\naspirations to establish a sovereign, independent State, \r\nliving side by side with Israel in peace and security. \r\nWe support the Palestinian leadership’s quest to form a \r\nnational unity Government and to hold presidential and \r\nparliamentary elections.\r\nWe are seriously concerned about the situation in the \r\nGaza Strip, where the humanitarian situation continues \r\nto be very serious. There is not enough drinking water, \r\nthere are disruptions in electricity supplies and the \r\nunemployment rate is among the highest in the world. \r\nAll of that contributes to radicalization among local \r\nresidents, which is being used by extremists. We agree \r\nwith the view of the international community on the \r\nneed to lift the blockade on Gaza.\r\nBecause of the difficult humanitarian situation \r\nfaced by Palestinian refugees, the Russian Federation \r\nin November decided to provide a yearly voluntary \r\ncontribution to the budget of the United Nations Relief \r\nand Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast.\r\nNext year marks 50 years since the adoption of \r\nSecurity Council resolution 242 (1967), which is one \r\nof the main documents whose international legal basis \r\nis generally recognized for a comprehensive Middle \r\nEast settlement. Unfortunately, we have to note that, \r\nafter half a century, this outmoded, chronic conflict \r\nis still far from being resolved, and the prospects for \r\na settlement still remain vague. The relative calm of \r\nrecent times in the Arab conflict should not mislead us. \r\nThe situation remains tense and fraught with danger in \r\nthe context of the conflagrations that are taking place in \r\nthe Middle East region, which are fraught with the most \r\nserious consequences. But this anniversary of the most \r\nimportant Security Council decision on a Middle East \r\nsettlement should and must become for us a stimulus to \r\nachieve progress in that most important area of world \r\npolitics.\r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 21/32\r\nMs. Ibrahim (Maldives): On behalf of the Republic \r\nof the Maldives, I wish to express our deep appreciation \r\nto the Secretary-General for his reports under this \r\nagenda item (A/71/328, A/71/328/Add.1 and A.71/359) \r\nand his good offices, and for the continuing efforts to \r\nfind lasting solutions to the various conflicts that still \r\nplague the Middle East.\r\nThis debate is taking place at a timely juncture with \r\nregard to the situation in the Middle East, especially \r\nat a time when the world is apprehensive over the \r\ngrave humanitarian situation in Syria, particularly the \r\nescalating violence in Aleppo. The Maldives remains \r\ngravely concerned about the escalating violence and \r\nconflict in the region as a whole. The Middle East is the \r\ncradle of civilization and a centre of deep knowledge, \r\ntradition and culture, and peace in the region is crucial \r\nfor its people and for the world as a whole.\r\nPeace is both an enabler and a by-product of \r\ndevelopment, for there is no peace without development \r\nand no development without peace. The situation in the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory illustrates that reality. \r\nThe Palestinian people continue to suffer under the \r\nIsraeli occupation. With no end in sight to the conflict \r\nand the violence, basic necessities such as food, water, \r\nemployment, working institutions and systems remain \r\ncompromised. Over the past 70 years, generations \r\nhave grown up in an atmosphere of hatred, fear and \r\nviolence. Nonetheless, the occupation of the Palestinian \r\nterritories and the incessant violation of the human \r\nrights of the Palestinian people continue unchecked.\r\nThe failure to realize the right to self-determination \r\nof the Palestinian people epitomizes the inability of the \r\ninternational community to work together to bring an \r\nend to the Palestinian conflict despite countless United \r\nNations resolutions, the Madrid principles, the Oslo \r\nAccords, the Arab Peace Initiative and the Quartet road \r\nmap, which strive to overcome the Israeli occupation \r\nand apartheid system in place. The perpetual hostility \r\nand conflict in occupied Palestine have compromised \r\npeace and security in the region for decades. A solution \r\nis necessary. The Maldives reiterates its call for the \r\nfull realization of the right to self-determination of the \r\nPalestinian people. The Maldives stands with Palestine \r\nin its quest to establish its own State alongside Israel on \r\nthe basis of the pre-1967 borders, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital.\r\nThe Maldives notes with grave concern the events \r\nthat are taking place in Syria, particularly Aleppo, \r\nwhich the Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian \r\nAffairs characterized as “our generation’s shame” in \r\nhis briefing to the Security Council  (see S/PV.7795). \r\nFor years, we have watched the violence in Syria \r\nescalate and the death toll reach into the thousands. \r\nIt is now into the hundreds of thousands, with even \r\nmore people displaced and injured and nearly a million \r\npersons under siege. The Maldives is raising its voice \r\nat the United Nations, doing all it can to support the \r\nSyrian people — the Syrian men, women and children \r\nwho are suffering endlessly. We call upon all parties to \r\nset politics aside and take the side of humankind.\r\nWhile Syria is being destroyed, the conflict is \r\ncausing an unending web of violence and destabilization \r\nin the entire Middle East region. The vacuum created \r\nin many parts of the region has led to the birth of the \r\nso-called Islamic State, which uses the Islamic religion \r\nto falsely legitimize barbaric and relentless violations \r\nof humanitarian law. The Maldives condemns attempts \r\nto attribute any terrorism to any religion, culture or \r\ntradition. We condemn any such acts committed in the \r\nname of Islam. We condemn terrorism and terrorist \r\nattacks in all their forms and dimensions.\r\nIn today’s interconnected world, the effects of \r\nconflict in the region cannot be contained, nor should \r\nthey be. The international community has to step up, \r\ntake action and present a united front and a unified \r\nvoice against terrorism, against violence and against \r\noppression. We cannot stress enough the importance of \r\npolitical compromise and the productive engagement \r\nof the international community to resolve the many \r\nconflicts in the Middle East. The Maldives looks to \r\nthe United Nations and the international community to \r\nmake renewed efforts for a lasting solution in a region \r\nthat has been mired in strife for far too long.\r\nMr. Okamura (Japan): I thank the President for \r\nconvening this important meeting. I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to congratulate the people of Palestine \r\non the occasion of yesterday’s International Day of \r\nSolidarity with the Palestinian People.\r\nInstability in the Middle East has had repercussions \r\nbeyond the region, the most prominent manifestations \r\nbeing the waves of refugees and migrants and the spread \r\nof violent extremism. The international community \r\nhas dealt with those issues with mixed results at best. \r\nHowever, we must be aware that they are just symptoms \r\nof deeper issues that we should not lose sight of. \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n22/32 16-40731\r\nIn the Security Council open debate on the situation \r\nin the Middle East in July (see S/PV.7736), Japan \r\nstressed that the restoration and the strengthening of \r\ngovernance must be promoted in order to create an \r\ninclusive and tolerant society that is resilient against \r\nextremism. Those efforts cannot be completed \r\novernight, and the international community must be \r\nunited in making such efforts.\r\nWith regard to the question of Palestine, a number of \r\nresolutions will be adopted during the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly. However, we should not consider \r\nthat that represents sufficient  international effort to \r\nbring about a peaceful solution to the issue. Now more \r\nthan ever, we need actions that have a tangible impact \r\non the ground. With regard to Palestine, it seems that \r\nwe have actually moved away from achieving a two-\r\nState solution.\r\nSettlement activities by Israel continue in the West \r\nBank and East Jerusalem. Settlement activities are in \r\nviolation of international law. Japan calls upon Israel to \r\nimmediately freeze such activities. \r\nAt the same time, we continue to see violence from \r\nboth sides, with varying degrees of intensity. Cases \r\nof violence indicate that a one-State reality is not in \r\nthe interests of either party, in view of the persisting \r\nviolence and turmoil. I would like to call upon the \r\nleaders of both sides to renew their commitment to a \r\ntwo-State solution and to take concrete steps towards \r\nthe resumption of peace negotiations.\r\nJapan stands ready to cooperate with initiatives \r\nthat will have a positive impact in promoting a two-\r\nState solution. We have also continued our own efforts \r\nto create an environment more conducive to peace \r\nnegotiations. One example is the Jericho Agro-Industrial \r\nPark, the f lagship project of our Corridor for Peace and \r\nProsperity initiative. We have continuously invested in \r\nthe Park, which is a medium- to long-term project to \r\npromote the sustainability of the Palestinian economy, \r\nin cooperation with Israel, Jordan and Palestine. The \r\nproject is approaching its tenth year, and now we have \r\nthree Palestinian companies operating and creating \r\njobs. We envisage that in the coming years the products \r\nmade in the Park will be exported through Jordan to the \r\nregion and beyond. We believe that a more sustainable \r\nPalestinian economy will make the two-State solution \r\nmore viable, and cooperation among the parties through \r\nthe project enhances the spirit of coexistence.\r\nAchieving a two-State solution means achieving \r\ncoexistence between Israel and Palestine. In order to \r\nfacilitate confidence-building between the two, Japan \r\nhas been inviting future leaders in various fields \r\nfrom both sides to Japan since 1997. During their \r\nstay in Japan, they have a chance to engage in various \r\nactivities together and exchange views. We have held \r\nthat programme every year for about 20 years, and over \r\n200 people have participated so far. I had the chance to \r\nmeet with one of the participants from the Israeli side. \r\nHe appreciated his experience very much and told me \r\nthat before the programme he had never had a chance to \r\ntalk in depth with a Palestinian. We are looking forward \r\nto again welcoming five Israelis and five Palestinians \r\nnext month.\r\nThere is no easy solution to the question of \r\nPalestine, but we believe that even when the political \r\nprocess is stagnant, there is something that we can do to \r\ncreate an environment more conducive to peace. Japan \r\nstands ready to continue its efforts together with the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Middle East today is awash with issues, many \r\nof which are symptoms of deeper problems. While \r\nsymptoms themselves are often quite difficult, we must \r\nkeep in mind the necessity of embodying inclusiveness \r\nand coexistence in the region so as to achieve enduring \r\npeace. If the parties cannot share a hope for such \r\na future, it is very difficult for them to sit down and \r\nnegotiate. \r\nJapan believes that governance, inclusiveness \r\nand coexistence are the keys to bringing peace to that \r\nregion of great diversity. We will continue to engage in \r\nthe region with that perspective in mind.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in the debate on this item. \r\nBefore moving on to the voting, I would like \r\nto inform members that action on draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.8 and A/71/L.22 will be taken after we take \r\naction on draft resolutions A/71/L.18, A/71/L.19, \r\nA/71/L.20 and A/71/L.22, which were submitted under \r\nagenda item 35. \r\nThe General Assembly has thus concluded this \r\nstage of its consideration of agenda item 34.\r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 23/32\r\nAgenda item 35 (continued)\r\nQuestion of Palestine \r\nDraft resolutions (A/71/L.18, A/71/L.19, \r\nA/71/L.20 and A/71/L.21)\r\nThe Acting President: Before the Assembly takes \r\naction on the draft resolutions one by one, members are \r\nreminded that they will have an opportunity to explain \r\ntheir vote on all four draft resolutions before and after \r\naction is taken on all draft resolutions. \r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat. \r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I would like to inform \r\nthe Assembly of an oral revision of draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.18, which the the sponsors have requested \r\nthe Secretariat to announce. The document symbol \r\nin footnote 7 of this draft resolution, which reads \r\n“UNCTAD/APP/2016/1”, should read “TD/B/63/3”. \r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed to \r\nconsider draft resolutions A/71/L.18, as orally revised, \r\nA/71/L.19, A/71/L.20 and A/71/L.21. \r\nBefore giving the f loor to delegations in \r\nexplanations of vote before the voting, may I remind \r\ndelegations that explanations of vote are limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats. \r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Israel.\r\nMs. Meitzad (Israel): I would like to begin by \r\nspeaking of the deadly fires that raged in Israel for over \r\na week, which were put out in the past few days. As a \r\nconsequence of those fires, dozens of Israeli citizens \r\nhave been hospitalized and tens of thousands have been \r\nforced to evacuate their homes. Fortunately, no lives \r\nwere lost in that catastrophe, but hundreds of families \r\nwatched their homes disintegrate in front of them and \r\nsaw the places of their precious family moments go up \r\nin smoke.\r\nSadly, some, including Hamas, chose that moment \r\nof tragedy to celebrate the terrible human loss and even \r\nto encourage further deliberate acts of arson. While \r\nthe fires brought out such appalling and heartless \r\nbehaviour, the tragedy also brought out the best in \r\nhumankind. Nations from around the world came to our \r\naid when we needed them most. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to thank those that have already supplied \r\ncrucial help, namely, Cyprus, Greece, Italy, the Russian \r\nFederation, Turkey, Croatia, France, Spain, Azerbaijan, \r\nUkraine, the United States of America, the United \r\nKingdom, the Palestinian Authority and all other States \r\nthat offered their assistance. Let me add that the sight of \r\nIsraeli and Palestinian firefighters standing side by side \r\nto fight those fires is a symbol of hope for the future.\r\nOn 29 November 1947, the United Nations adopted \r\nresolution 181 (II), known as the partition resolution, \r\nwhich recommended the creation of independent Arab \r\nand Jewish States living side by side. While the State of \r\nIsrael accepted that resolution, the Arab world rejected \r\nit and launched a war against the newly established \r\nState. Sixty-nine years later, it is shameful to see \r\nhow that important date has become an annual event \r\ndedicated to bashing Israel at the United Nations, and \r\nhow some countries, many of which spoke here today \r\nand yesterday, have yet to accept the existence of Israel \r\nin the Middle East and abuse this Hall to spread baseless \r\nallegations against my country.\r\nThe Assembly is convened here today to vote on a \r\nseries of draft resolutions that serve those who prefer \r\nto promote a biased narrative that does not serve \r\neither side. The six draft resolutions that are being \r\nconsidered here today not only fail to promote dialogue \r\nor build trust, but they also create an organizational \r\ninfrastructure that abuses United Nations funding to \r\nallow anti-Israel activities to take place under United \r\nNations auspices.\r\nAt a time when the world is facing many devastating \r\nconflicts and humanitarian disasters, it is regrettable \r\nto see that the Assembly is meeting once again to \r\nadopt draft resolutions that divert precious financial \r\nresources to wasteful and politicized bodies whose \r\nonly purpose is to attack Israel. Those bodies include \r\nthe special information programme on the question \r\nof Palestine and the Division for Palestinian Rights \r\nof the Secretariat — the only Secretariat bodies that \r\nare dedicated solely to one specific conflict, or more \r\nprecisely, to the public relations activities of one side \r\nto the conflict — as well as the Committee on the \r\nExercise of the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian \r\nPeople, which is a hotbed of anti-Israel activity.\r\nThe Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People is tasked with promoting \r\nthe Palestinian political agenda at the United Nations. \r\nThe Committee organizes United Nations events and \r\ninternational conferences specializing in presenting \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n24/32 16-40731\r\nfalse facts and half-truths and in promoting an agenda \r\nclearly directed against Israel. The Committee has also \r\naccredited a number of non-governmental organizations, \r\nsome of which call for the boycott of Israel, and they do \r\nso as invited guests of the Committee at United Nations \r\nevents held on United Nations premises.\r\nThat outrageous Committee is being supported \r\nby an office in the Secretariat, namely, the Division \r\nfor Palestinian Rights, which runs the United Nations \r\nanti-Israel propaganda programme, mobilizing the \r\nresources of the Department of Political Affairs to \r\npromote their agenda. Such a division is unparalleled \r\nin this institution. There is no other office in the \r\nSecretariat that runs a propaganda programme against \r\na State Member of the United Nations, and does so \r\nusing United Nations resources.\r\nAs for the special information programme on the \r\nquestion of Palestine, that is a programme led by the \r\nDepartment of Public Information, which has offered \r\na biased and misleading narrative about our region \r\nsince its inception. Circulating prejudiced materials \r\nunder the banner of the United Nations undermines \r\nthis institution’s integrity and impartiality. Hence, it is \r\ncrucial to make sure that no United Nations platform \r\nis being abused in order to disseminate materials \r\npromoting anti-Israel messages, including social media \r\nplatforms.\r\nUnfortunately, the recent International Media \r\nSeminar on Peace in the Middle East, organized by the \r\nDepartment of Public Information, which took place \r\nin August in Pretoria, was an unfortunate reminder \r\nof the all-too-common distortion and manipulation of \r\ninformation by a United Nations body. As is evident \r\nfrom the seminar’s discussions, debates and panels, \r\nit was a completely one-sided event, presenting \r\nonly the Palestinian narrative. Shamefully, some of \r\nthe speakers expressed open sympathy with the the \r\nboycott, divestment and sanctions movement, which is \r\nconducting a global campaign of misinformation and \r\noutright slander against Israel.\r\nIn the light of that information, it is quite baffling \r\nwhy the United Nations, which faces a severe budgetary \r\ndeficit, would spend approximately $6.5 million a \r\nyear on those bodies, which are dedicated solely to \r\npromoting the Palestinian narrative. Those who vote in \r\nfavour of these resolutions should ask themselves: Why \r\nis the United Nations giving that money to promote \r\na purely anti-Israel agenda instead of allocating it to \r\nthose who are in dire need of humanitarian assistance?\r\nThese outrageous and wasteful resolutions are not \r\nonly counterproductive, but they also become more \r\ndetached from reality with each passing year. Since \r\nSeptember 2015, terror attacks against Israelis have \r\nclaimed the lives of 42 citizens and injured more than \r\n600. Yet these draft resolutions include no mention \r\nof those victims, let alone take a stand condemning \r\nthe incitement that fuelled the vile acts of terror that \r\nbrought about their terrible fates. \r\nFurthermore, the draft resolutions under discussion \r\ndo not mention the internationally recognized terror \r\norganization Hamas — not even once. That is an \r\norganization that fires rockets towards Israel and \r\nbuilds terror tunnels, in a clear threat to the safety and \r\nsecurity of both Israeli citizens and the population of \r\nGaza alike. \r\nThe list can go on and on, but the bottom line is \r\nvery clear: selective and biased resolutions will not \r\nbring the two sides together; it will only drive them \r\nfurther apart.\r\nAnother concerning element of these resolutions is \r\nthe shameful refusal to use the term “Temple Mount”. \r\nThe Temple Mount, what we call “Har Habayit” in \r\nHebrew, is the holiest site in the Jewish faith and a place \r\nsacred to all Abrahamic religions — Islam, Christianity \r\nand Judaism. Yet two of the draft resolutions that will \r\nbe voted on here today omit any reference to the Jewish \r\nor Christian connection to the Temple Mount. That \r\ndeliberate omission represents much more than just \r\nwords on paper. It is a testament to the persistent refusal \r\nof the Palestinians and their supporters to recognize the \r\nhistorical connection of the Jewish people to that holy \r\nsite and to the city of Jerusalem.\r\nThe bitter reality is that the six draft resolutions \r\noffer a one-sided account of the situation and only \r\nperpetuate a zero-sum approach to the conflict. They \r\nsend a message that the only way to support the \r\nPalestinians is by criticizing Israel. That idea is in \r\nstark contradiction to the cooperation we witnessed \r\njust recently between the two sides in a time of stress. \r\nLet no one delude themselves: supporting these draft \r\nresolutions and the inherent bias against Israel at the \r\nUnited Nations will not advance the cause of peace; it \r\nwill only make peace harder to achieve. I call on all \r\nthe Members that genuinely wish to assist in achieving \r\na durable solution for Israel and the Palestinians to \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 25/32\r\ntake a stand against these resolutions and take steps \r\nto facilitate direct negotiations, without preconditions, \r\nbetween the parties.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the only \r\nspeaker in explanation of

limited to 10 \r\nminutes and should be made by delegations from their \r\nseats.\r\nMr. Sandoval Mendiolea (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): My delegation wishes to speak in explanation \r\nof vote concerning resolution 71/21, entitled “Division \r\nfor Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat”. \r\nMexico recognizes the role that must be played \r\nby the Organization to raise awareness and support at \r\nthe international level for the rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople and the urgency of achieving a peaceful \r\nsettlement to the question of Palestine on the basis of \r\ninternational law and resolutions of the United Nations. \r\nMexico nevertheless wishes to stress the importance of \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n28/32 16-40731\r\nmaking more efficient and rational use of the resources \r\nof the Division for Palestinian Rights of the Secretariat \r\nin carrying out its functions.\r\nThe Government of Mexico reiterates its support \r\nfor the self-determination of the Palestinian people \r\nand its search for a comprehensive, just and lasting \r\nsettlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so as to \r\nrealize the two-State solution that permits both parties \r\nto live within secure and internationally recognized \r\nborders.\r\nMr. Teo (Singapore): I have the honour to speak in \r\nexplanation of vote following the adoption of resolutions \r\n71/20 through 71/23.\r\nSingapore voted in favour of resolution 71/20, \r\nentitled, “Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \r\nRights of the Palestinian People”, on the understanding \r\nthat the reference in paragraph 2 to the achievement \r\nof the two-State solution on the basis of the pre-1967 \r\nborders should be interpreted in the same manner as set \r\nout in paragraph 1 of resolution 71/23, entitled, “Peaceful \r\nsettlement of the question of Palestine”, namely, de by \r\nside in peace and security within recognized borders, \r\nbased on the pre-1967 borders.\r\nMr. Galbavý (Slovakia): I am speaking in \r\nexplanation of vote on resolution 71/23, entitled, \r\n“Peaceful settlement of the question of Palestine”. I \r\nhave the honour to speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion (EU). \r\nThe EU wishes to thank the Palestinian delegation \r\nfor the successful outcome of our negotiations on \r\na number of resolutions on which action was taken \r\nby the General Assembly. As an outcome of those \r\nnegotiations, the EU confirms its consolidated voting \r\npattern on those resolutions.\r\nAt this time, we would like to place on record that, \r\nwith regard to all resolutions that are adopted during \r\nthe seventy-first session of the General Assembly, \r\nthe European Union and its member States consider \r\nthat whenever the term “Palestinian Government” is \r\nmentioned, this refers to the Palestinian Authority. \r\nFurthermore, the use of the term “Palestine” in any of \r\nthose resolutions cannot be construed as recognition of \r\na State of Palestine, and its use is without prejudice to \r\nthe individual positions of the Member States on that \r\nissue, and hence on the question of the validity of an \r\naccession to the conventions and treaties mentioned \r\ntherein. We also point out that the European Union as \r\na whole has not expressed a legal qualification with \r\nregard to the term “forced displacement”, which is \r\nused in a number of draft resolutions submitted under \r\nagenda items 38 and 50.\r\nSome of the resolutions adopted today also refer \r\nto the holy sites in Jerusalem. The EU is concerned \r\nabout the worrying developments in that regard and the \r\nrecurrent violent clashes at the Temple Mount/Al-Haram \r\nAl-Sharif. The EU recalls the special significance of \r\nthe holy sites and calls for upholding the status quo \r\nput in place in 1976 for the Temple Mount/Al-Haram \r\nAl-Sharif in line with previous understandings and \r\nrespect to Jordan’s special role. The EU stresses the \r\nneed for language on the holy sites of Jerusalem to \r\nreflect their importance and historical significance \r\nfor the three monotheistic religions and to respect \r\nreligious and cultural sensitivities The EU recalls that \r\nthe terminology used in the resolutions does not imply \r\na change of its sense with regard to the Temple Mount/\r\nAl-Haram Al-Sharif/.\r\nMr. Sanabria de Montiel (Paraguay) (spoke \r\nin Spanish): My delegation would like to make an \r\nexplanation of vote on resolutions 71/20 and 71/21. \r\nThe Republic of Paraguay firmly believes that \r\ndialogue and direct and good-faith negotiations \r\nbetween the parties are the only path to achieve a \r\nfinal, just and lasting peace. That is why we call for \r\nthe resumption of the negotiating process and for the \r\ninternational community to support such efforts. The \r\nRepublic of Paraguay reaffirms the need to achieve \r\na just settlement to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in \r\naccordance with the Charter of the United Nations, the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council and other \r\nrelevant decisions whereby two democratic States, \r\nIsrael and Palestine, live side by side within secure and \r\ninternationally recognized borders.\r\nThe Republic of Paraguay believes that these \r\nresolutions will not contribute to the peaceful settlement \r\nof the conflict between the parties, and that is why it \r\nabstained in the voting.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 35.\r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 29/32\r\nAgenda item 34

before and after action is taken \r\non each.\r\nWe turn first to draft resolution A/71/L.8, entitled \r\n“The Syrian Golan”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of the \r\nSecretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of draft resolution A/71/L.8, \r\nthe following countries have become

delegations from their \r\nseats.\r\nMr. Vieira (Brazil) (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\nthe honour to speak on behalf of the delegations of \r\nArgentina and Brazil to explain our votes. \r\nAs we have done in previous years in regard to \r\nthe resolution concerning the Syrian Golan, which the \r\nAssembly has just adopted (resolution 71/24), Brazil \r\nand Argentina voted in favour of the resolution because \r\nwe believe that its fundamental nature is related to the \r\nunlawfulness of the acquisition of territory by force. \r\nArticle 2, paragraph 4 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations prohibits the threat or use of force against the \r\nterritorial integrity of a State. \r\nAt the same time, I would like to clarify the position \r\nof our delegations with regard to paragraph 6 of the \r\nresolution. Our vote does not prejudge the content of \r\nthat paragraph, in particular the reference to the line \r\nof 4 June 1967. Brazil and Argentina believe that it is \r\nimportant to advance in the search for a solution for the \r\nIsraeli-Syrian track of the conflict in the Middle East \r\nin order to end the occupation of the Golan Heights. \r\nTherefore, on behalf of the Governments of Brazil and \r\nArgentina, we again stress the importance of resuming \r\nnegotiations to find a definitive solution to the situation \r\nin the Syrian Golan, in accordance with Security \r\nCouncil resolutions 242 (1967) and 338 (1973) and the \r\nprinciple of land for peace.\r\nMr. Erdman (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States remains profoundly troubled by the \r\nsubmission of a disproportionate number of one-sided \r\nGeneral Assembly resolutions designed to condemn \r\nIsrael. That one-sided approach damages the prospects \r\nfor peace by undermining trust between parties and the \r\nkind of international support that is critical to achieving \r\npeace. All parties to the conflict have responsibilities \r\nfor ending it, and we are disappointed that United \r\nNations Members continually single out Israel without \r\nacknowledging the responsibilities and difficult steps \r\nthat must be taken on all sides. It is manifestly unjust \r\nthat the United Nations, an institution founded on the \r\nidea that all nations should be treated equally, is so \r\noften used by Member States to treat Israel unequally.\r\nThe United States votes against one-sided \r\nresolutions in the General Assembly, especially those \r\nthat renew the mandates of committees that use valuable \r\nUnited Nations resources, because we believe that they \r\nare counterproductive to the goal of achieving peace \r\nthat we all share. Of these annual resolutions, three \r\nUnited Nations bodies in particular reflect the bias, \r\nredundancy and unnecessary cost of such resolutions: \r\nthe Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable Rights \r\nof the Palestinian People, the Division for Palestinian \r\nRights and the Special Committee to Investigate \r\nIsraeli Practices Affecting the Human Rights of the \r\nPalestinian People and Other Arabs of the Occupied \r\n30/11/2016 A/71/PV.50\r\n16-40731 31/32\r\nTerritories. Those bodies waste limited United Nations \r\nresources, costing approximately $6.1 million in 2015, \r\nbut they do nothing to contribute to peace in the region \r\nand they perpetuate the perception of a United Nations \r\nthat unfairly focuses on Israel. \r\nThe United States remains firmly committed to \r\nadvancing a two-State solution. We continue to urge all \r\nsides to take steps to stop violence, improve conditions \r\non the ground in the West Bank and Gaza, and move \r\nthe diplomatic process forward. We strongly condemn \r\nall acts of violence and terrorism directed at unarmed \r\ncivilians, including stabbings, shootings, arson and \r\nvehicular attacks, as well as the statements glorifying \r\nthem.\r\nThe United States will support Israel’s right \r\nto defend innocent civilians against terrorism, and \r\nwe mourn any loss of innocent life. It is critical that \r\nevery possible effort be made to show restraint and to \r\nde-escalate tensions. I would like to reiterate that the \r\nUnited States has consistently opposed every effort \r\nto delegitimize Israel or to undermine its security at \r\nthe United Nations, and we will continue to do so with \r\nvigour. \r\nHowever, our continued opposition to the resolution \r\non Israeli settlements in the occupied Palestinian \r\nterritory, including Jerusalem and occupied Golan, \r\nshould not be understood to mean that we support \r\nsettlement activity. On the contrary, we view Israeli \r\nsettlement activity as illegitimate and corrosive to the \r\ncause of peace. Israeli settlement activity threatens the \r\nviability of a two-State solution. It also moves Israel \r\never closer to cementing a one-State reality of perpetual \r\noccupation, which is fundamentally inconsistent with \r\nIsrael’s future as a Jewish and democratic State. \r\nWhile the United States remains firmly opposed \r\nto Israeli settlement activity, that does not justify the \r\nrepetitive and one-sided General Assembly resolutions \r\nfacilitating the condemnation of Israel. Those \r\nresolutions set back our collective efforts to advance a \r\npeaceful resolution of the conflict between the Israelis \r\nand the Palestinians. In addition, they damage the \r\ninstitutional credibility of the United Nations, which \r\nshould be a concern for us all.\r\nSuch one-sided resolutions will not advance peace. \r\nOnly hard choices made in the context of bilateral \r\nnegotiations will do that. The cause of peace would be \r\nwell served by a more balanced approach by the General \r\nAssembly to the conflict.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote after the voting.\r\nMr.  Mounzer (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): My delegation would like to express its sincere \r\nappreciation to the General Assembly for adopting \r\nevery year since 1981, when Israel decided to annex the \r\nSyrian Golan, a resolution on the matter. We thank the \r\nAssembly for adopting resolution 71/24, as well as the \r\nother resolutions on the question of Palestine and the \r\nsituation in the Middle East. My country would like to \r\nthank all the delegations that decided to co-sponsor the \r\nresolution on the Syrian Golan, as well as those who \r\nvoted in favour of it.\r\nThe majority of States Members of the United \r\nNations have continued to support the resolutions, which \r\nreflect their commitment to the purposes and principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations, in particular the \r\nrejection of foreign occupation and support for our full \r\nright to recover all our land occupied by Israel since \r\n1967. The vote in favour of those resolutions sends a \r\nclear international message to Israel, namely, that the \r\nkillings, the expansion, the settlement activities, the \r\nimposition of a fait accompli and the annexation of land \r\nby force are all rejected. Those practices run counter \r\nto international principles, including the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the Fourth Geneva Convention \r\nof 1949. Therefore, all those practices will always be \r\nmet with rejection by every party that seeks to uphold \r\ninternational law and rejects foreign occupation and the \r\nacquisition of lands taken by force.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nobserver of the Observer State of Palestine.\r\nMs. Abdelhady-Nasser (Palestine): On behalf of \r\nthe delegation of the State of Palestine, I wish to express \r\nour sincere thanks and appreciation to all Member \r\nStates that voted in favour of the important resolutions \r\nthat the Assembly has just adopted and that adhere in \r\nword and deed to the legal, political and humanitarian \r\nprinciples and rules enshrined therein.\r\nThe General Assembly’s adoption of these \r\nresolutions, once again by an overwhelming majority, is \r\na reflection of the long-standing international consensus \r\nregarding the rights of the Palestinian people and the \r\nfundamental requirements for achieving a just, lasting, \r\ncomprehensive and peaceful solution to the question \r\nof Palestine in all its aspects, without exception. \r\nThose resolutions are also a clear reaffirmation of \r\nthe international consensus on the two-State solution, \r\nA/71/PV.50 30/11/2016\r\n32/32 16-40731\r\nbased on the 1967 borders, in accordance with the \r\nrelevant Security Council and General Assembly \r\nresolutions, the Madrid principles and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative — a solution that is now in grave peril owing \r\nto the violations, destructive actions and rejectionism \r\nof Israel, the occupying Power. Lastly, these resolutions \r\nanswer firmly, clearly and thoroughly the false \r\nassertions, distortions and negative discourse that we \r\nhave heard in this Hall from the Israeli delegation.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to express the profound \r\ngratitude of the delegation of the State of Palestine, on \r\nbehalf of the Palestinian people and their leadership, \r\nfor all of the compelling expressions of support to the \r\nPalestinian people and solidarity with them and the \r\njust cause of Palestine in recent days and during the \r\nmany long years. We experience despair at this ongoing \r\ninjustice, as we mark yet another Day of Solidarity \r\nand as we approach the painful anniversaries of the \r\ncoming year, including, inconceivably, the fiftieth \r\nyear of Israel’s illegal foreign occupation of our land \r\nand oppression of our people and denial of our rights. \r\nThe deep despair and hopelessness among our people \r\nis increasing, yet the support and solidarity of the \r\ninternational community, from countries and peoples \r\nall around the world, help us to remain hopeful that we \r\nwill indeed one day overcome the current injustice and \r\nrealize our freedom and rights in our own independent \r\nand sovereign State of Palestine, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital, and finally achieve peace and coexistence \r\nbetween Palestine and Israel, despite the fact that that \r\nprospect seems very distant at this moment. We renew \r\nour thanks and appreciation to all delegations for their \r\nprincipled support.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 34.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting Pesident: I would like to consult \r\nmembers regarding an extension for the work of the \r\nSecond Committee. \r\nMembers will recall that, at its 48th plenary \r\nmeeting, on 21 November, the General Assembly \r\nagreed to extend the work of the Second Committee \r\nto Wednesday, 30 November. However, I have been \r\ninformed by the Chair of the Second Committee that \r\nthe Committee requests an additional extension of \r\nits work to Friday, 9 December, in view of the fact \r\nthat such an extension will be needed to conclude \r\nnegotiations on the draft resolution on the quadrennial \r\ncomprehensive policy review of operational activities \r\nfor the development of the United Nations system.\r\nMay I therefore take it that the General Assembly \r\nagrees to extend the work of the Second Committee \r\nuntil Friday, 9 December 2016?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.25 p.m.\r\n"
