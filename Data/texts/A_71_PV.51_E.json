During \r\nthe session, 118 delegations made statements within \r\nthe general debate segment, while an impressive 302 \r\ninterventions were made during the thematic discussion \r\nsegment. That can be compared with 112 delegations \r\nand 273 statements in 2015. During the action phase, \r\nthe Committee adopted 69 draft resolutions and \r\ndecisions, 35 of which were adopted by recorded vote \r\nwith 29 separate votes requested. That can be compared \r\nwith 57 draft resolutions and decisions in 2015.\r\nThe first report, submitted under agenda item 89, \r\nentitled “Reduction of military budgets”, is contained \r\nin document A/71/441 and, as indicated, no proposal \r\nwas put forward in the Committee.\r\nThe proposals considered under agenda items 90, \r\n91, 92, 94, 97, 100, 102, 103 and 105 were all adopted \r\nwithout a vote. Oral statements by the Secretariat \r\nwere made prior to the adoption of draft resolution \r\nA/C.1/71/L.4, entitled “Convention on Prohibitions \r\nor Restrictions on the Use of Certain Conventional \r\nWeapons Which May Be Deemed to Be Excessively \r\nInjurious or to Have Indiscriminate Effects”, \r\nsubmitted under agenda item 102; and draft resolution \r\nA/C.1/71/L.56, entitled “Convention on the Prohibition \r\nof the Development, Production and Stockpiling of \r\nBacteriological (Biological) and Toxin Weapons and on \r\nTheir Destruction”, under agenda item 105.\r\nOf the eight proposals considered under agenda \r\nitem 99, “Review and implementation of the Concluding \r\nDocument of the Twelfth Special Session of the General \r\nAssembly”, seven were adopted without a vote, and \r\noral statements by the Secretariat were made prior \r\nto the adoption of draft resolution A/C.1/71/L.50, \r\nentitled “United Nations Regional Centre for Peace \r\nand Disarmament in Africa”, and draft resolution \r\nA/C.1/71/L.62, entitled “United Nations regional \r\ncentres for peace and disarmament”.\r\nThe First Committee voted on 35 proposals \r\nsubmitted under seven agenda items, namely, 93, 95, \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org).

Since the issuance of the \r\nreport of the First Committee on agenda item 101, \r\nentitled “The risk of nuclear proliferation in the Middle \r\nEast” (A/71/453), the Secretariat has been informed \r\nthat the Comoros had intended to vote in favour of draft \r\nresolution A/C.1/71/L.2/Rev.1 as a whole.\r\nAgenda item 98, entitled “General and complete \r\ndisarmament”, accounted for 25 of the 29 separate \r\nvotes, 6 of the 11 oral statements made by the Secretariat \r\nand the two programme-budget implications issued for \r\nthe session.\r\nWith regard to item 121, “Revitalization of the work \r\nof the General Assembly”, the draft decision containing \r\nthe provisional programme of work and timetable of \r\nthe First Committee for 2017 is contained in document \r\nA/71/458.\r\nAs indicated in the report of the Committee in \r\ndocument A/71/459, the need did not arise for the \r\nCommittee to take up item 135, “Programme planning”.\r\nI have the honour to submit to the General Assembly \r\nfor its consideration and adoption the draft resolutions \r\nand draft decisions recommended by the Disarmament \r\nand International Security Committee in its reports \r\ncontained in documents A/71/441 to A/71/459.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to recall the high \r\nlevel of cooperation prevailing in the First Committee. \r\nThe Committee was able to fulfil the mandate entrusted \r\nto it by the Assembly and to complete its work within the \r\ntime allotted by the Assembly. I should like to express, \r\non behalf of the Bureau of the Committee, our sincere \r\nappreciation to all delegations for their constructive \r\nparticipation during the session. In that regard, I would \r\nlike to note in particular the positive manner in which \r\nthe new e-delegate and e-cosponsorship tools were \r\nembraced by delegations.\r\nI should like to pay particular tribute here to \r\nthe Chair of the First Committee, His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Boukadoum of Algeria, whose knowledge \r\nand experience in multilateral forums, enhanced by his \r\nconsummate diplomatic skills, enabled the Committee \r\nto consider in depth all of the agenda items allocated to \r\nit. The other members of the Bureau, Mr. Rene Zeleny \r\nof the Czech Republic, Ms. María Soledad Urruela \r\nArenales of Guatemala, and Mr. Kamapradipta Isnomo \r\nof Indonesia, with whom I had the pleasure of working, \r\nalso contributed greatly to the successful conclusion of \r\nthe work of the Committee.\r\nFinally, I would like to recognize the dedicated \r\nsupport of Mr. Kim Won-soo, High Representative for \r\nDisarmament Affairs, and the staff of the Office of \r\nDisarmament Affairs, as well as the Secretary of the \r\nCommittee, Ms. Sonia Elliott, and her team: conference \r\nofficers, interpreters, record keepers, press officers, \r\ndocuments officers, sound technicians and information \r\ntechnology staff.\r\nThe Acting President: If there is no proposal under \r\nrule 66 of the rules of procedure, I shall take it that the \r\nGeneral Assembly decides not to discuss the reports of \r\nthe First Committee that are before the Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Statements will therefore \r\nbe limited to explanations of vote.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the \r\nrecommendations of the First Committee have been \r\nmade clear in the Committee and are reflected in the \r\nrelevant official documents.\r\nMay I remind members that, in accordance with \r\nGeneral Assembly decision 34/401, a delegation should, \r\nas far as possible, explain its vote only once, that is, \r\neither in the Committee or in plenary meeting, unless \r\nthat delegation’s vote in the plenary meeting is different \r\nfrom its vote in the Committee, and that the explanations \r\nof vote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the First \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to proceed to take decisions in the same \r\nmanner as was done in the Committee, unless notified \r\notherwise in advance. That means that where separate \r\nor recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I \r\nalso hope that we may proceed to adopt without a vote \r\nthose recommendations that were adopted without a \r\nvote in the First Committee.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I would like to draw the \r\nattention of Member States to a note by the Secretariat, \r\nin English only, entitled “Situation reports of the First \r\nCommittee on agenda items 89 to 105, 121 and 135”, \r\nwhich has been circulated as document A/C.1/71/INF/3. \r\nThe note has been distributed desk to desk in the Hall \r\nto be held as a reference guide for action on the draft \r\nresolutions and the decisions recommended by the First \r\nCommittee in its reports. In that connection, members \r\nwill find in the second column of the note the symbols \r\n05/12/2016 A/71/PV.51\r\n16-41339 3/48\r\nof the draft resolutions and decisions of the First \r\nCommittee, with the corresponding symbols of the \r\nreport for action in the plenary in the fourth column. \r\nFor reports containing multiple recommendations, the \r\ndraft resolution or decision number is contained in the \r\nfifth column of the note.\r\nFurthermore, members are reminded that additional \r\nsponsors are no longer accepted now that the draft \r\nresolutions and decisions have been adopted by the \r\nCommittee. Any clarification about sponsorship in the \r\nCommittee reports should be addressed to the Secretary \r\nof the Committee.\r\nMoreover, Member States are reminded that any \r\ncorrections to the voting intentions of delegations, after \r\nthe voting has concluded on the proposal, should be made \r\ndirectly to the Secretariat after the meeting in writing. \r\nIn that regard, I would seek members’ cooperation in \r\navoiding any interruptions to our proceedings.\r\nAgenda item 89\r\nReduction of military budgets\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/71/441)\r\nThe Acting President: May I take that the General \r\nAssembly wishes to take note of the report of the \r\nFirst Committee?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is \r\nthe wish of the General Assembly to conclude its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 89?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nAgenda item 90\r\nAfrican Nuclear-Weapon-Free Zone Treaty\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/71/442)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before it \r\na draft resolution recommended by the First Committee \r\nin paragraph 7 of its report.

We have expressed our \r\nopinion on it many times, because the use of chemical \r\nweapons is a violation of international law. However, in \r\nview of the wording of the resolution — particularly with \r\nregard to the crisis in Syria and especially in paragraph \r\n2 — and based on our policy of distancing ourselves \r\nfrom any intervention in that crisis, we abstained in the \r\nvoting, despite our support for the resolution’s aims and \r\nour commitment and conviction that the Convention \r\nshould be fully implemented and that we should \r\ncooperate internationally in its framework.\r\nMr. Ammar (Pakistan): I am taking the f loor \r\nto explain my delegation’s vote on resolution 71/67, \r\n“Nuclear disarmament verification”. Pakistan remains \r\ncommitted to achieving a nuclear-weapon-free world \r\nthrough the conclusion of a universal, verifiable and \r\nnon-discriminatory comprehensive convention on \r\nnuclear weapons. We support the commencement \r\nof negotiations to that end in the Conference on \r\nDisarmament.\r\nWe recognize that the process of multilateral \r\nnuclear disarmament involving the reduction and \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons would be a complex \r\nundertaking, and that verification would be an essential \r\nand key component of such a process, the credibility \r\nof which would rest to a large degree on an effective \r\nand independent verification mechanism, to be agreed \r\non during the negotiations. The negotiations for a \r\ncomprehensive nuclear-weapon convention should \r\nbe undertaken holistically, not pursued piecemeal. \r\nNonetheless, we see the value in doing some expert \r\nwork on the issue of verification in a representative \r\nforum that includes all the relevant stakeholders.\r\nIn our view, the most suitable forum for that work \r\nwould be the Conference on Disarmament. Its rules \r\nof procedure and past precedent would enable the \r\ncreation of a subsidiary body for this purpose. We \r\ngave the sponsors of resolution 71/67 an amendment to \r\nthat effect; however, they chose to task a 25-member \r\ngroup of governmental experts, not the Conference on \r\nDisarmament, to do the work. In a demonstration of our \r\nf lexibility and desire to contribute to the process, my \r\ndelegation decided to vote in favour of the resolution. \r\nWe did so in a spirit of constructive engagement that we \r\nhope will help to make a practical contribution to the \r\ncause of nuclear disarmament. In that context, we hope \r\nto be part of the group of governmental experts to be \r\nestablished pursuant to the resolution.\r\nMr. Mahfouz (Egypt): Egypt is taking the f loor \r\nto explain its vote on resolution 71/50, on the Arms \r\nTrade Treaty.\r\nAs a matter of fundamental policy, Egypt is \r\nwell aware of the facts of the illicit trafficking in \r\nweapons. We are fully committed to exerting every \r\neffort to combat and eradicate the illicit trade in arms. \r\nNevertheless, Egypt abstained in the voting on the draft \r\nresolution entitled “The Arms Trade Treaty”, for we \r\nare of the view that the Treaty cannot be considered \r\nuniversal or inclusive. We therefore do not accept the \r\ntext contained in paragraph 3, on which we already \r\nvoiced reservations in consultations. In fact, the United \r\nNations Conference on the Arms Trade Treaty was \r\nunable to achieve consensus. Egypt regrets that the \r\nfinal Conference was unable to reach agreement on a \r\nbalanced and robust text acceptable to all States.\r\nEgypt expresses its reservation on the principle \r\nof adopting an important international disarmament \r\ninstrument through a vote. Neglecting the consensus \r\nA/71/PV.51 05/12/2016\r\n40/48 16-41339\r\nprinciple is a negative precedent that undermines the \r\nbasis upon which most international agreements on \r\ndisarmament have been developed. In that context, \r\nEgypt shares the following concerns.\r\nFirst, with regard to the lack of definitions of \r\nimportant terms and concepts that are essential for \r\nimplementing the Treaty, including “end use” and “end \r\nuser”, we stress that providing information regarding \r\n“end use’ and “end user” should be consistent with \r\nthe laws and national security requirements of the \r\nreceiving party.\r\nSecondly, another important missing element \r\nconcerns the criteria by which an exporter would \r\ndetermine the application of the Treaty. In that \r\nconnection, we believe that the international community \r\nis meant to rely chiefly on the Register of Conventional \r\nArms, which includes only seven categories of weapons, \r\nexcluding small arms and light weapons.\r\nThirdly, the inclusion of a clear reference to the \r\ncrimes of aggression and foreign occupation as part of \r\nthe assessment would have clarified the implementation \r\nprocess and resulted in the essence of the Treaty being \r\non regulating the arms trade, not restricting it.\r\nFourthly, Egypt believes that all countries should be \r\nequally accountable to common benchmarks. Without \r\nagreed definitions or clear criteria, the implementation \r\nof the Treaty runs the risk of being subjective. It would \r\ndepend upon the national political considerations of \r\nexporting States.\r\nThe efforts of the international community should \r\ncontinue to focus on filling in the remaining gaps that \r\nthe Arms Trade Treaty has left untouched. We continue \r\nto call for addressing the elements of overproduction \r\nand the ever-increasing stockpiles of conventional \r\nweapons within the territories of major arms exporters \r\nand producers. We still believe that every effort must \r\nbe exerted to bring production and stockpiles in major \r\narms-producing States under international scrutiny. \r\nInternational accountability is the only guarantee \r\nagainst the possible abuse of the existing imbalance \r\nbetween major arms producers and the rest of the world.\r\nWe will be following closely the further \r\ndevelopments regarding the implementation of the \r\nTreaty, in order to determine our further position.\r\nMr. Toro-Carnevali (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We abstained in the \r\nvoting on resolution 71/69, entitled “Implementation of \r\nthe Convention on the Prohibition of the Development, \r\nProduction, Stockpiling and Use of Chemical Weapons \r\nand on Their Destruction”, as well as against the \r\nthird and fourth preambular paragraphs and operative \r\nparagraphs 2 and 3, for the following reasons.\r\nDuring the past three years, the resolution on the \r\nChemical Weapons Convention has evolved in a negative \r\nmanner, focusing in a partial way on certain countries.\r\nThat has caused this resolution to lose the consensus \r\nbacking it enjoyed for two decades. That situation \r\nbenefits no one; on the contrary, it affects us all. My \r\ndelegation has always publicly declared the importance \r\nVenezuela attaches to the Chemical Weapons \r\nConvention. As a State party to the Convention, we \r\nactively participate in the work of the organization, and \r\nwe condemn the development, production, stockpiling \r\nand use of chemical weapons by whomever, wherever \r\nand under any circumstance.\r\nAt the same time, we believe that the full \r\nimplementation of all of the provisions of the Convention \r\nrequires joint efforts on the part of all States parties. \r\nWe have been emphatic in pointing out that the General \r\nAssembly is not the forum in which to repeat speeches \r\nand discussions that should take place at The Hague in \r\nthe framework of the Organization for the Prohibition \r\nof Chemical Weapons. On the contrary, the General \r\nAssembly is the forum in which we should promote \r\nand consolidate the unity of us all in supporting the \r\nConvention.\r\nPolitical manipulation in this text against a particular \r\ncountry does not have any link to the key objective of \r\nthis First Committee resolution, whose raison d’être is \r\nto promote and strengthen the unity of everyone behind \r\nthe Convention. In previous years, Venezuela has called \r\nupon the sponsors of the resolution to reconsider the way \r\nthey have been managing the resolution. Unfortunately, \r\nfor the third time in the long history of this important \r\nresolution, confrontation and politicization prevail, \r\ninstead of the spirit of cooperation and unity. We call \r\non the sponsors to reconsider once more the position \r\nthey have been taking.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 98.\r\n05/12/2016 A/71/PV.51\r\n16-41339 41/48\r\nAgenda item 99\r\nReview and implementation of the Concluding \r\nDocument of the Twelfth Special Session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nReport of the First Committee (A/71/451)\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly has before \r\nit eight draft resolutions recommended by the First \r\nCommittee in paragraph 23 of its report. Before \r\nproceeding further, I wish to inform delegations that \r\naction will proceed based on the roman numerical order \r\nof the draft resolutions in the report of the Committee.\r\nWe will now take a decision on draft resolutions \r\nI through VIII one by one. After all the decisions \r\nhave been taken, representatives will again have an \r\nopportunity to explain their vote or position on any or \r\nall of the draft resolutions.\r\nDraft resolution I is entitled “United Nations \r\ndisarmament fellowship, training and advisory \r\nservices”. The First Committee adopted it without a \r\nvote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes to do the \r\nsame?\r\nDraft resolution I was adopted (resolution 71/73).\r\nThe Acting President: Draft resolution II is \r\nentitled “United Nations Disarmament Information \r\nProgramme”.

Nuclear disarmament has been \r\na top priority of Egyptian foreign policy, in the firm \r\nbelief that nuclear weapons constitute a grave danger to \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nMy delegation will abstain in the voting on the \r\nfourth preambular paragraph of the draft resolution \r\nto express our strong objection to the reference within \r\nthat paragraph to the controversial Security Council \r\nresolution 2310 (2016), given that, substantively, it not \r\nonly falls outside the purview of the Security Council, \r\nbut it is also legally and technically f lawed in its relation \r\nto the nuclear disarmament regime. We regret that such \r\na resolution was adopted by the Security Council. \r\nWe have six specific reservations with regard to \r\nSecurity Council resolution 2310 (2016).\r\nFirst, the Security Council is not the appropriate \r\nforum to deal with the Treaty, since the preparatory \r\ncommittee for the Comprehensive Nuclear Test-Ban \r\nTreaty Organization and its Provisional Technical \r\nSecretariat in Vienna have fully played that role to date. \r\nInvolving the Security Council in the technical aspects \r\nof the Convention creates unnecessary duplication, a \r\nparallel track and an unfavourable environment that is \r\nnot universal. \r\nSecondly, the draft resolution clearly fails \r\nto highlight the centrality of Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons with regard to \r\nthe nuclear disarmament regime. Surprisingly, it does \r\nnot refer at all to the need of achieving the univerality \r\nof the Non-Proliferation Treaty.\r\nThirdly, it would have been logical to treat not \r\nonly the symptoms, but the disease itself. Addressing \r\nnuclear tests exclusively in that resolution, without \r\nmentioning the need for nuclear disarmament and to \r\nfree the world of those immoral and inhuman weapons \r\nof mass destruction, in accordance with article VI \r\nof the Non-Proliferation Treaty, not only allows the \r\nacquisition of those weapons but also prolongs their \r\nacquisition by the nuclear-weapon States, thereby \r\ncreating a situation that threatens international peace \r\nand security.\r\nFourthly, Security Council resolution 2310 (2016) \r\nis unacceptable and unfair. It places the nuclear-weapon \r\nStates on an equal footing with the non-nuclear-weapon \r\nStates with regard to the question of accession. The \r\nnuclear States and those that are not party to the Treaty \r\nshould always assume a special responsibility. \r\nFifthly, the resolution in its current form and \r\nlanguage — I refer here to Security Council resolution \r\n2310 (2016) — represents interference in the work \r\nof the preparatory committee Provisional Technical \r\nSecretariat of the CTBT in Vienna. Thus, it will not \r\nonly have a counterproductive impact on the work in \r\nVienna, but also completely undermine its role if the \r\nSecurity Council continues to be involved with the \r\ntechnical dossier.\r\nSixthly and lastly, Security Council resolution 2310 \r\n(2016) reflects a puzzling dilemma, as it feverishly \r\nsupports the completion of the verification regime, \r\nwhile many major Powers shirk their obligations in \r\nthis context and do not assume their responsibilities \r\nin ratifying the CTBT on the pretext of their domestic \r\npolicies and legislation.\r\nThe Acting President: We will now take a decision \r\non the draft resolution.\r\nSeparate, recorded votes have been requested on \r\nthe fourth and seventh preambular paragraphs of the \r\ndraft resolution.\r\nI shall first put to the vote the fourth preambular \r\nparagraph.\r\nA recorded vote was taken.\r\nIn favour:\r\nAfghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Andorra, Angola, \r\nAntigua and
