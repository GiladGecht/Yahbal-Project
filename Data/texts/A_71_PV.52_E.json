"United Nations A/71/PV.52\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n52nd plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 6 December 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.10 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 11\r\nSport for development and peace\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/179)\r\nThe President: The history of sport traces back \r\nto ancient civilizations. Our ancestors played sport \r\nto impress the gods. They played to mark the arrival \r\nof seasons and to celebrate peace after conflict. By \r\nengaging in healthy competition, they built physical \r\nstrength and fostered community spirit. Indeed, \r\nthe ancient Greek tradition of the Olympic Truce, a \r\ntemporary ceasefire to enable athletes and spectators \r\nto travel and compete safely at games, was premised on \r\nthe recognition of the importance of sport in building \r\npeace and goodwill.\r\nAcross the world, sport has been used time and \r\nagain to advance peace and reconciliation. Who can \r\nforget the iconic image of Nelson Mandela holding \r\nup the 1995 Rugby World Cup and using that moment \r\nto unite the people of South Africa in the wake of \r\napartheid? To this day — whether we are watching \r\nchildren kicking around homemade footballs, or our \r\nathletic heroes breaking records or the determined look \r\nof Paralympians competing or the refugee Olympic \r\nteam entering the Rio de Janeiro stadium — sports have \r\nthe power to transcend borders and inspire us all.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nrecognizes the importance of sport as an enabler of \r\nsustainable development in peace through its promotion \r\nof tolerance and respect, the empowerment of women and \r\nyoung people, and its contribution to health, education \r\nand social inclusion. Sport is a tool for driving forward \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nWe see its application in the Goals related to the health \r\nand well-being and the empowerment of women and \r\ngirls and the achievement of peaceful and inclusive \r\nsocieties. We see it in helping to build the confidence, \r\nstrength and capacities of young persons, persons with \r\ndisabilities and minority communities.\r\nThe General Assembly’s 2013 decision to declare \r\n6 April the annual International Day of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace elevated global awareness of the \r\nrole of sport in peace and development. I congratulate \r\nthe Group of Friends of Sport for Development and \r\nPeace for its work in that regard, and for promoting \r\nthe importance of sport more broadly. I also commend \r\nthe United Nations Office on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace for its work to promote sport as a means for \r\nfurthering the goals of the United Nations, including \r\nthrough the United Nations Action Plan on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace.\r\nThe Office’s priority areas of conflict resolution, \r\ngender equality, the development of Africa and the \r\ninclusion of persons with disabilities and youth \r\ndevelopment are particularly important. Nelson \r\nMandela said,\r\n“Sport can create hope, where once there was only \r\ndespair. It is more powerful than Governments in \r\nbreaking down racial barriers. It laughs in the face \r\nof all types of discrimination.”\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

As pride gave way \r\nto disarray and celebration gave way to sorrow, the \r\nexpressions of solidarity and sympathy that came from \r\nall continents are symbolic of the most noble sentiments \r\nthat sport can foster, and of our commitment to the \r\nuniversal language of sport and our gratitude to those \r\nwho promote its values. The gesture of awarding that \r\ndevastated team the cup is symbolic of the generosity \r\nof sport. We offer our Brazilian friends, who hosted the \r\nthirty-first Olympic games and the fifteenth Paralympic \r\nGames in Rio de Janeiro in August and September, our \r\ncondolences during this terrible ordeal.\r\nAfter the adoption of resolution 69/6, in 2014, \r\non sport as a means to promote education, health, \r\ndevelopment and peace, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, adopted last year, designated sport as \r\nan important element of sustainable development. \r\nThe political declaration that prefaced the 2030 \r\nAgenda recognized the growing contribution of sport \r\nto development and peace through the tolerance and \r\nrespect it advocates, to the empowerment of women and \r\ngirls, individuals and groups, and to the attainment of \r\nhealth, education and social inclusion objectives.\r\nThe values that sport upholds can be seen in all \r\naspects of our lives through all of the benefits that it \r\nprovides individuals and communities. Our collective \r\nefforts to promote sport in the Organization have been \r\nsuccessful. In a world full of danger and violence, any \r\ninitiative that calls for unity and social cohesion is \r\nprecious. We must harness the full potential of sport for \r\nthe three pillars of sustainable development.\r\nSince 2008, the Special Adviser to the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nMr. Wilfried Lemke, has consistently revitalized and \r\nstrengthened the role of sport in the Organization’s \r\nagenda. As his mandate comes to an end, we \r\nwholeheartedly thank him, along with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, for his personal commitment to this issue \r\nand for having promoted the culture of sport at the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nPromoting sport for development and peace, as we \r\nhave been doing since 2010 as one of the co-Chairs of \r\nthe Group of Friends of Sport for Development and \r\nPeace, has convinced me of the extraordinary potential \r\nof sport to bring people together, narrow differences \r\nand foster a culture of peace among the youth — which \r\nis so important to Mr. Lemke. I would also like to \r\nthank him for his generosity, his spontaneity and his \r\nperseverance. He embodies the values of sport and has \r\nmade youth his priority. He successfully established \r\nYouth Leadership Camps. In those camps, the Special \r\nAdviser has prioritized equality among young boys and \r\ngirls and restored dignity to persons with disabilities. \r\nWe are therefore extremely grateful to the Special \r\nAdviser to the Secretary-General. In this tribute, \r\nwe join all of those who have worked by his side in \r\nthe United Nations Office on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace.\r\nThe draft resolution that is to be introduced at a \r\nlater date (A/71/L.38) calls for renewing the mandate \r\nof the Special Adviser to ensure that sport contributes \r\nto achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and preserving the legacy of more than \r\n10 years of work.\r\nWithout question, the role of sport in the United \r\nNations agenda has benefited fully from the support \r\nof the International Olympic Committee (IOC), even \r\nbefore it was granted observer status by the General \r\nAssembly, in 2009. While the resolution on the Olympic \r\nDay (resolution 49/29), which dates from the forty-\r\nninth session of the General Assembly, strengthened \r\nthe links between the IOC and the United Nations, its \r\nformalization is due to the leadership of Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, IOC President Thomas Bach \r\nand, before him, IOC President Rogge. We welcome the \r\npartnership and are grateful for its efforts.\r\nAgenda 2030 is our road map. Monaco has teamed up \r\nwith an innovative project centred on sport through the \r\nSustainable Development Goals Fund in an inter-agency \r\nmechanism. The project will be launched in 2017 and \r\nwill involve athletes, teams and sports institutions in \r\ncollaboration with United Nations agencies. We hope \r\nthat other partners will join that promising initiative. \r\nThe Fund aims to convey the values of sport, namely, \r\nteam spirit, a sense of community, tolerance, respect, \r\ncommitment and the importance of a healthy lifestyle. \r\n06/12/2016 A/71/PV.52\r\n16-41516 3/13\r\nIt will work on school absenteeism, exclusion and \r\nreducing juvenile delinquency, while addressing sport \r\nand education holistically.\r\nAs is well known, sport is deeply rooted in \r\nMonegasque culture. Local and global sporting events \r\naimed at the youth of the Principality and the greatest \r\nworld champions are organized in Monaco throughout \r\nthe year. As such, sport forms a major part of the \r\nPrince’s governmental policy.\r\nAs it does every year on the occasion of Universal \r\nChildren’s Day, on 20 November, the non-governmental \r\norganization Children \u0026 Future organized the no-finish-\r\nline solidarity race where participants covered the \r\ndistance from the Earth to the Moon, by walking or \r\nrunning, day and night for eight days. It is a symbolic \r\ndistance that was not only achieved, but surpassed, \r\nby the participants. Through their participation in \r\nthe eight-day race, participants raised €400,000 for \r\nMonaco’s international cooperation and development \r\nprogrammes.\r\nFurthermore, the ninth Peace and Sport Forum took \r\nplace in Monaco a few days ago, with 600 participants \r\nfrom 70 countries. A march for peace preceded \r\nthe opening of the Forum, which brought together \r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert II and Founder \r\nPresident Joël Bouzou, three 2015 Nobel Peace Prize \r\nlaureates from Tunisia, decision-makers in the field \r\nof sport and the Forum’s Champions of Peace, who \r\npromote peace through sport and the public. The theme \r\nof the ninth edition was “Peace in action: changing the \r\nworld through sport”. One of the five plenary meetings \r\nwas devoted to the theme “Diplomacy through sport: \r\nbreaking down barriers”, which is what we must do \r\nhere each day.\r\nWhile highlighting the necessary cooperation among \r\ndiplomatic representations and intergovernmental \r\norganizations involved in the movement for peace \r\nthrough sport, the Forum provided a framework for \r\ntwo meetings: the Council of Europe held an official \r\nseminar on its Convention on the Manipulation of \r\nSports Competitions, and UNESCO held a preparatory \r\nmeeting for the tenth International Conference of \r\nMinisters and Senior Officials responsible for Physical \r\nEducation and Sport, to be held from 5 to 7 July 2017 in \r\nKazan, Russian Federation.\r\nIn addition to its social network campaign “White \r\ncard for peace”, the Peace and Sport Forum developed \r\na handbook of appropriate practices for outdoor sports \r\nsome years ago. The aim of that manual is to make sport \r\navailable to all, especially children who lack access to \r\nsports facilities. What we must keep in mind, above \r\nand beyond the extraordinary images transmitted to us \r\nfrom global events such as the Olympic Games and the \r\nmany World Cups, including rugby and football, is the \r\nfact that a nice stadium is not necessary for practicing \r\nsport. Furthermore, we intend to share some innovative \r\npractices by inviting the Peace and Sport Forum and \r\nthe United Nations next year to celebrate the upcoming \r\nInternational Day of Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nin April 2017.\r\nIn conclusion, it is unfortunate that the biennial draft \r\nresolution will not be adopted today, but I am confident \r\nthat, with the participants’ goodwill in the negotiations, \r\nthe draft resolution will soon be adopted by consensus \r\nby the General Assembly — which I welcome. It is \r\nsomething that we must not fail to achieve.\r\nMr. Churkin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): Russia highly values the role of the United \r\nNations in strengthening international cooperation in \r\nsport, as that contributes to overcoming inter-ethnic \r\nand interreligious strife, while strengthening mutual \r\nunderstanding among nations and achieving harmony \r\namong civilizations.\r\nSport has an enormous potential to unite. In today’s \r\ndifficult environment, it is more important than ever \r\nto maintain efforts to transform sport into a tool for \r\nachieving tolerance, solidarity and multiculturalism \r\nand a driving force for comprehensive socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment. Our country has always attached the \r\nhighest importance to those issues.\r\nWe have extensive experience in holding large-scale \r\ninternational sports competitions. In preparing for the \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Games in Sochi in 2014, Russia \r\nbuilt unique sports facilities and created a modern \r\ntransportation and resort infrastructure. In addition to \r\npowerful socioeconomic effects, those Games became \r\na major impulse for the further development of mass \r\nsports in our country. In recent years, the number of \r\nthose who regularly participate in athletic activities \r\nincreased by nearly 35 per cent.\r\nToday Russia faces an equally ambitious challenge \r\nin preparing for and hosting the football World Cup \r\nin 2018. We fought openly for the right to hold that \r\nmajor competition, with the desire to promote that \r\nmost popular sport. We are doing everything to ensure \r\nthat the championship will be held at the highest level \r\nA/71/PV.52 06/12/2016\r\n4/13 16-41516\r\npossible. The scale of the task before us is greater than \r\nany other project ever carried out on Russian territory. \r\nA comprehensive programme is in place to prepare \r\nfor the championship, which currently includes the \r\nconstruction of 269 sites. In addition to 122 sports \r\nfacilities, such as stadiums and training fields, that \r\nalso includes transportation facilities and aviation, \r\nhousing and energy infrastructure and hotel and health-\r\ncare infrastructure.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed a dangerous \r\ntrend of politics interfering in sports, turning it into an \r\ninstrument for creating negative images of countries \r\nand peoples. Great political pressure has been put on \r\nthe International Olympic Committee and international \r\nathletic federations. In essence, that is an attack on \r\nthe fundamental principles of the international sport \r\nmovement, as well as its independence and integrity. \r\nFor instance, in the run-up to the Games in Sochi, \r\nwe experienced the full force of the anti-Russian \r\npropaganda machine, which resulted not only in \r\nbaseless accusations, but in falsified information.\r\nThe unprecedented decision to ban the entire \r\nRussian Paralympic team from the Paralympic Games \r\nin Rio de Janeiro in 2016 was also extremely politicized \r\nand cynical. The targeted campaign against our \r\nathletes was the embodiment of double standards and \r\nthe principle of collective responsibility. No specific \r\nevidence-based charges were ever advanced against our \r\nathletes. They were banned simply because they were \r\npart of the Russian team. As a result, they were not the \r\nonly ones who suffered, but it was in essence a blow to \r\nthe prestige of world sport in general, as well as to the \r\nOlympic and Paralympic Movements.\r\nRussia is open to cooperation in combating \r\ndoping. We have been conducting the appropriate \r\ninvestigations into the relevant allegations and intend \r\nto ensure that our national anti-doping system achieves \r\nmaximum effectiveness. We currently have in place a \r\nnational anti-doping plan, which includes tightening \r\nlegislation that entails responsibility, including \r\ncriminal responsibility, for the use and distribution of \r\ndoping drugs, as well as for putting pressure on athletes \r\nto use such drugs. We also have an independent public \r\nanti-doping commission. In order to ensure the full \r\nindependence of our anti-doping structures, we are \r\nmaking relevant changes to the Russian anti-doping \r\nagency, including increasing its financing. That work is \r\nbeing carried out in active cooperation with the relevant \r\ninternational organizations and the International \r\nOlympic Committee. We are also instilling a public \r\nculture promoting the total rejection of doping in our \r\ncountry. Those major efforts will continue in Russia.\r\nHowever, there is also obviously a pressing need \r\nto establish whether or not everything is indeed so \r\nrosy outside Russia. In that regard, it is unacceptable \r\nto continue to ignore the information that has become \r\npublic knowledge in the sport world that anti-doping \r\nbodies tacitly approved the use of powerful drugs \r\nby athletes who, over many years, have won major \r\ninternational championships and made tens of millions \r\nof dollars. The claims that they were suffering from \r\nserious illnesses contradicts common sense. All of that \r\nappears particularly hypocritical against the backdrop \r\nof the ban on our paralympic athletes simply based on \r\nsuspicions. That can hardly be seen as being in line \r\nwith the principles of equality and fair play. We intend \r\nto discuss the matter further in United Nations forums. \r\nThe international anti-doping system must become \r\ntransparent and ensure the unconditional equality of all \r\nathletes. Overall, there is a need to develop common \r\ninternational doping-control criteria. Not just athletes, \r\nbut the public must have access to information related \r\nto doping testing.\r\nSport has been rightly called the universal language \r\nof human communication. We must do everything to \r\nensure clean sport and make it completely open and \r\nremoved from politics, so that sport ideals and values \r\ncan bring countries and peoples together.\r\nMrs. Sánchez Rodríguez (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): We would like to express our gratitude for the \r\nreport (A/71/179) submitted by the Secretary-General, \r\nwhich reviews the actions carried out during a two-year \r\nperiod in the United Nations system for the promotion \r\nof sport for the benefit of sustainable development \r\nand peace. We believe that the initiatives carried out \r\nhave been positive and again reflect the fact that sport \r\nconstitutes an excellent tool for promoting integration, \r\nsocial inclusion and development.\r\nCuba has given popular sport development a place \r\nin the quality of life of the population; its practice is free \r\nfor all citizens. Guaranteeing the enjoyment of sport as \r\na constitutional right for all Cubans is one of the most \r\nrelevant achievements of the Cuban revolution in the \r\narea of human rights. Since the triumph of the Cuban \r\nrevolution, in 1959, and under the leadership of Fidel \r\nCastro Ruz, sport in our country stopped being exclusive \r\nand became a right for all people. For the realization \r\n06/12/2016 A/71/PV.52\r\n16-41516 5/13\r\nof that right, we have established a pedagogical system \r\nthat incorporates physical education as an integral part \r\nof a person’s education at all its stages. We are working \r\nto achieve sport preparation from early childhood, \r\nwhich allows us to foster the talents of those who stand \r\nout as future athletes, which enhances and elevates \r\nthe levels achieved by our country in the international \r\nsport arena.\r\nFor years, the Cuban sporting movement, headed \r\nby the Cuban Olympic Committee and the National \r\nInstitution of Sport, Physical Education and Recreation, \r\nhas volunteered its impartial collaboration with various \r\ncountries of the South through the exchange of coaches, \r\ninstructors and trainers, so that, in their modest way \r\nand within the framework of bilateral agreements, \r\nit could transfer innovative sport-training methods, \r\nthereby contributing to improving sporting results and \r\nthe popular practice of sport, as well as developing great \r\nbonds of brotherhood and friendship among peoples.\r\nWe have also strengthened international cooperation \r\nby establishing for the countries of the South the Institute \r\nof Sport Medicine and the Anti-Doping Laboratory, \r\nwith the goal of contributing to the fight against the \r\nscourge of drugs, as well as the education and culture \r\nof athletes and trainers. Furthermore, Cuba founded the \r\nInternational School for Physical Education and Sport, \r\nwhich is dedicated to training professionals, whose key \r\nvalue is solidarity, which is capable of transforming \r\nphysical education and sport in their countries.\r\nCuba reiterates its decisions to continue sharing \r\nour principal richness: the human capital created by \r\nthe Cuban revolution and the best experiences that we \r\nhave. The presence of Cuban solidarity in the world, \r\nwith coaches and physical education teachers, sustains \r\nthe prestige of Cuban sport. Cuba has supported the \r\nsporting achievements of many countries and will \r\ncontinue doing so to the greatest extent possible.\r\nAll of those goals, which have been achieved at the \r\nnational level through cooperation, have been possible \r\nthanks to the will of the Government and the citizens \r\nof Cuba. Notwithstanding the efforts aimed at the full \r\nrealization of that right, various obstacles have hampered \r\nprogress during the more than 50 years of the genocidal \r\npolicy of the economic, financial and commercial \r\nblockade imposed on Cuba, because of which Cuban \r\nsporting institutions have been prevented from gaining \r\naccess to United States market installations, equipment \r\nand sportswear.\r\nAt the same time, we oppose athletic activity \r\nbeing undertaken solely as a means to make money \r\nand, as a consequence, we denounce the theft of \r\nsporting talents, of which developing countries are the \r\nvictims. In that regard, we appeal for the fostering of \r\ninternational cooperation and solidarity. We are also \r\npromoting projects in the areas of education, culture, \r\nsport and health, instead of spending billions of dollars \r\non armaments. That money could do a lot for the right \r\nto development of billions of people in the world with \r\nrelatively few resources; it simply requires sincere \r\npolitical will.\r\nFinally, Cuba reaffirms its commitment to the \r\npromotion of sport, both for the Cuban people and \r\nfor those brotherly nations that need our modest \r\ncontribution and experience in that area.\r\nMr. Stone (Australia): Australia is committed to \r\nthe principles of sport for development and peace and to \r\nthe role that the United Nations can play in furthering \r\nthose principles.\r\nWe would like to thank Monaco and Tunisia \r\nfor co-chairing the Group of Friends of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace and for their facilitation of \r\nthe related biennial draft resolution (A/71/L.38), which \r\nAustralia is pleased to co-sponsor. We would also like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank the Special Adviser \r\nto the Secretary-General on Sport for Development \r\nand Peace, Mr. Wilfried Lemke, for all that he has \r\ndone to promote the United Nations work on sport for \r\ndevelopment and peace over the past eight years.\r\nSport’s popularity, its capacity as a communication \r\nplatform and its ability to connect people, both within \r\nand between communities, make it a tool that can \r\nbe used to meet a range of development challenges, \r\nincluding the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nAustralia is committed to delivering an effective sport-\r\nfor-development programme, one of four goals outlined \r\nin the Australian sport-diplomacy strategy launched in \r\nJune 2015. During the past five years, the Australian \r\nGovernment has committed more than $50 million \r\nto sport for development programmes in the Asia-\r\nPacific region.\r\nAustralia’s sport-for-development programmes \r\nsupport communities at the grass-roots level through \r\ncollaboration between Australian sport organizations \r\nand their Asia-Pacific counterparts. The sport-\r\nfor-development programmes focus on achieving \r\npositive development outcomes by addressing risk \r\nA/71/PV.52 06/12/2016\r\n6/13 16-41516\r\nfactors associated with non-communicable diseases, \r\nparticularly physical inactivity; supporting people with \r\ndisabilities through inclusion in sport by challenging \r\ncommunity perceptions; fostering the equality of \r\nwomen and girls by showcasing achievement and \r\nchallenging gender norms; and improving social \r\ncohesion by bringing people together.\r\nThe Pacific Sports Partnership programme works \r\nwith 11 Australian sporting organizations across nine \r\nPacific countries. In 2015-2016 the Pacific programmes \r\nengaged more than 350,000 people, almost half of \r\nthem women and girls and more than 3,000 of them \r\nhaving a disability. The new Asia Sports Partnership \r\nprogramme works with 18 countries, and strong \r\nparticipation is also expected. Australian sport-for-\r\ndevelopment programmes can contribute to improving \r\nhealth-related behaviour. One such example is the One \r\nNetball Pacific programme in Tonga and Samoa, where \r\nadult sports participants, sports-development officers \r\nand community members are working to increase their \r\nexercise levels and improve their diets. Our sport-\r\nfor-development programmes are also contributing \r\nto attitudinal change for, and about, people living \r\nwith disabilities, with sporting participants reporting \r\nthat they receive increased respect and support from \r\ncommunities and families.\r\nAustralia’s table tennis programme has smashed \r\ndown barriers and assists more than 200 patients in \r\nKiribati’s only mental facility by promoting motivation, \r\nwell-being and fitness through sport. Australian-funded \r\nactivities are also a platform for harnessing community \r\nsupport around gender-equality issues, such as violence \r\nagainst women. The Asia and Pacific programmes \r\nhighlight women’s abilities and achievements and \r\nnormalize young people’s experience of women in \r\npositions of power. Since June 2014, Australia’s sport-\r\nfor-development programmes have also increased their \r\nfocus on social cohesion and peacebuilding, including \r\nin the aftermath of natural disasters, such as Cyclone \r\nPam in Vanuatu and Cyclone Winston in Fiji. Australia \r\nhelped to launch the Just Play Emergency programme in \r\nFiji, bringing vital information to children about water \r\nand sanitation and allowing them to feel safe through the \r\nsimple act of playing football together. Building on that \r\nsuccess, new programmes in Asia support resilience in \r\nSri Lanka through netball, access to quality inclusive \r\nsport in Afghanistan through cricket and community \r\nrecovery through badminton in Nepal.\r\nBeyond the primary goals related to health, \r\ndisability, gender and peace, Australian sport-for-\r\ndevelopment programmes make a strong contribution \r\nto related sectors, such as education, leadership and \r\neconomic empowerment. Australia will continue to use \r\nits expertise in delivering inclusive community sports \r\nto make a positive impact in the region.\r\nMr. Amer (Israel): Israel is proud to be one of the \r\nsponsors of draft resolution A/71/L.38, which focuses \r\non the transformative and unifying power of sport. \r\nSport can help build more inclusive societies, promote \r\ndevelopment and foster a future of peaceful coexistence. \r\nSport also serves as a powerful tool to advance gender \r\nequality and empower women and girls.\r\nAs the report (A/71/179) of the Secretary-General \r\nshows, sport initiatives have a positive social impact \r\nand can raise awareness of environmental issues \r\nand disease prevention, promote inclusiveness for \r\npeople with disabilities and improve education levels \r\nin schools.\r\nThis year we will mark the 120th anniversary of the \r\nrevival of the Olympic Games. The goal of the Olympic \r\nMovement is to contribute to building a peaceful and \r\nbetter world. Sadly, that has not always been the case. \r\nDuring the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich, on the \r\nnight of 5 September, eight armed terrorists from the \r\nPalestinian terrorist group Black September murdered \r\n11 members of the Israeli delegation. This year, after 44 \r\nyears, the International Olympic Committee held the \r\nfirst memorial service for the victims of the Munich \r\nmassacre. During the memorial, the President of the \r\nInternational Olympic Committee, Thomas Bach, said:\r\n“We commemorate them because this was an attack \r\nnot only on our fellow Olympians, but also an assault \r\non the values that the Olympic Village stands for. \r\nIt was an attack on the universal power of sport to \r\nunite all of humanity in peace and solidarity”.\r\nThat tragic event is a warning for posterity that \r\nsport should not be used as a vehicle for incitement \r\nand hatred. We have a shared responsibility to keep the \r\nmemory of the Munich massacre alive and to protect \r\nthe peaceful message and sanctity of sports.\r\nNowhere is the unifying power of sport more \r\nevident than on Israel’s national sports teams, where \r\nMuslims, Jews and Christians all wear the same \r\nuniform. Whether they win together or lose together, \r\nthey always keep the team spirit. One sport initiative \r\n06/12/2016 A/71/PV.52\r\n16-41516 7/13\r\nthat has made a lasting social impact is Mamanet, \r\nthe Israeli Mothers’ Cachibol League. Founded by \r\nan Israeli mother, Mamanet brings together mothers \r\nfrom all ages, religions and backgrounds to play ball. \r\nMamanet leaves no mother behind. It is not about \r\nwho can score the most points or who is the fastest, \r\nbut rather about empowering women by giving them \r\na sense of belonging to a unique community with \r\nshared goals. Mamanet shows how mothers can serve \r\nas powerful role models within their families and \r\ncommunities by promoting good sportsmanship, team \r\nwork and commitment to physical health. Mamanet is \r\nmore than just a sport league; it is also a platform for \r\nadvancing social causes and community initiatives. Its \r\nunique model is quickly spreading, and Austria, Italy, \r\nGreece, Cyprus and the United States of America have \r\nalready adopted it.\r\nA unique sports project, headed by the Shimon Peres \r\nPeace Centre in Israel, is another example of how sport \r\ncan act as a catalyst for peaceful coexistence. Every \r\nyear, the Twinned Peace Sport School project brings \r\ntogether about 2,000 Israeli and Palestinian children \r\nto play sport in mixed teams. Those sport programmes \r\nnot only develop the children’s physical fitness, but also \r\nfoster mutual understanding and teach them tolerance, \r\nsportsmanship and teamwork. In the process, they can \r\nheal wounds, mend fences and overcome differences. \r\nThe founder of that programme, Israel’s late President \r\nShimon Peres, once said,\r\n“I think peace should be done not only among \r\nGovernments but among people”.\r\nBy protecting and promoting the fundamental \r\nvalues of equality and mutual respect and by overcoming \r\nadversity through sport, we can create a more peaceful \r\nand inclusive future for generations to come.\r\nMs. Al-Saleh (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to extend the condolences of Qatar \r\nto the Government of Brazil over the tragic air crash \r\ninvolving Brazilian athletes.\r\nI thank the President of the General Assembly \r\nfor his efforts and for the holding of this meeting to \r\ndiscuss agenda item 11, entitled “Sport for development \r\nand peace”. I also thank Mr. Lemke, United Nations \r\nSpecial Adviser to the Secretary-General on Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace, for his strenuous efforts in \r\nsupporting sport as a means of development and peace.\r\nNumerous General Assembly resolutions have \r\ntouched on building a better, more peaceful world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideals. The importance \r\nof sport has been acknowledged as a means to foster \r\neducation, health, development and peace. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to shed light on my country’s \r\nexperience, which reflects our firm belief in the \r\nimportant role of sport in fostering dialogue among \r\ncultures and in promoting peace and development.\r\nQatar’s Ministry for Youth and Sport deepens the \r\nconcepts of health, education and peace through sport-\r\noriented youth centres, sport unions and clubs, and the \r\nOlympic Committee helps pupils to undertake physical \r\nactivities. The State of Qatar is a member of the Group \r\nof Friends of Sport for Peace and Development. It \r\nco-chaired that Group with Costa Rica in Geneva \r\nin 2013. As part of the Qatar National Vision 2030, \r\nand in order to carry out the initiative to create a \r\npsychologically and physically active society, in 2012 \r\nwe designated 2 February as our annual Sports Day. \r\nThat day is an official holiday in the State of Qatar and a \r\npart of a pioneering and unique international initiative. \r\nThe purpose of that initiative was to consecrate the \r\nconcept of societal sport and increase participation in \r\nvarious activities. That day is the best way to increase \r\nsociety’s participation in sports, enabling all members \r\nof our society to engage in activities that make them \r\nhappier, strengthen public health and promote sports \r\nculture.\r\nThe document entitled “Transforming our world: \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development” states \r\nthat sport is an important empowering element of \r\nsustainable development and peace. It encourages \r\ntolerance and respect and helps women and young \r\npeople to participate in society and achieve their goals \r\nin the fields of health, education and social integration. \r\nIn the light of our interest in sport at the regional and \r\ninternational levels, we have hosted major sporting \r\nevents, such as the 2006 Asian Games, as well as \r\nthe world athletic championships for persons with \r\ndisabilities. Qatar has become an important centre \r\nfor hosting various regional and international athletic \r\nevents and tournaments, because it believes in the \r\nimportant role played by sport in building bridges \r\nand integrating societies in their quest to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe High Commission on Heritage plays a \r\nsignificant role in preparing for the 2022 Football \r\nWorld Cup, so that that occasion will be one of the most \r\nA/71/PV.52 06/12/2016\r\n8/13 16-41516\r\nsalient and successful in promoting the values of peace, \r\ndevelopment and understanding among our peoples. It \r\nwill be the first time that the championship is hosted in \r\nthe Middle East region. That will assist in promoting \r\ngrowth in the region by encouraging capacity-building \r\nand the participation of young people and will be an \r\nimportant forum for fostering understanding and \r\ndialogue among cultures. With a view to promoting \r\nthe hosting of major sporting events, Qatar, along with \r\nthe Permanent Missions of Germany, the Republic of \r\nKorea, the Russian Federation and Tunisia to the United \r\nNations, and the United Nations Office on Sport, \r\nDevelopment and Peace, organized a high-level event \r\nat United Nations Headquarters on 16 February to shed \r\nlight on the importance of hosting major sporting events \r\nas a means of fostering socioeconomic, environmental \r\nand sustainable development.\r\nParticipants focused on the socioeconomic and \r\ndevelopmental role of hosting major sporting events \r\nand on lessons learned, as well as on the constructive \r\nimpact on local communities, which benefit from the \r\nopportunities such events offer. Participants emphasized \r\nthe constructive role played by major sporting events \r\nin developing the capacity of young people, women \r\nand persons with disabilities with different languages, \r\nreligions and cultures. The State of Qatar reiterates its \r\ndetermination to continue its efforts to invest in sport \r\nso as to pave the way for an environment conducive \r\nto understanding and to strengthen cooperation, \r\nsolidarity and peace at the national, regional and \r\ninternational levels.\r\nMr. Pong (Singapore): Before I begin my statement, \r\nmy delegation would like to extend our deepest \r\nsympathy to our Brazilian colleagues, families and \r\nsupporters of and others involved with the Chapecoense \r\nFootball Club. Please accept our condolences.\r\nSingapore looks forward to the adoption of the \r\ndraft resolution entitled “Sport as a means to promote \r\neducation, health, development and peace” (A/71/L.38). \r\nWe welcome the ideals represented in the draft \r\nresolution, and we would like to thank Monaco and \r\nTunisia for facilitating the text.\r\nSport is a potent force for positive change in society. \r\nIt brings people together and inspires the human spirit. \r\nIt transcends differences in cultures, nationalities \r\nand socioeconomic backgrounds, and it contributes \r\nsignificantly to peace and sustainable development. The \r\nOlympic Truce — first established in the eighth century \r\nB.C.E. — has demonstrated time and again how sport \r\ncan bridge divided communities, support reconciliation \r\nand foster peace. More recently, the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development recognizes the growing \r\ncontribution of sport to the achievement of development \r\nand peace in its promotion of tolerance and respect \r\nand the empowerment of women and young people, \r\nindividuals and communities, as well as its contribution \r\nto health, education and social-inclusion objectives.\r\nIn Singapore we hope to engender greater \r\ninclusiveness, acceptance and understanding of persons \r\nwith disabilities through sport. We launched a disability \r\nsports master plan last year to ensure a more inclusive, \r\nsporting Singapore, where everyone, regardless of \r\nability, can take part and even excel in sport. The master \r\nplan will harness the potential of sport by making it \r\neasier for those with disabilities to lead an active \r\nlifestyle. It seeks to improve access and opportunities \r\nfor persons with disabilities to participate in sport and \r\nto develop and grow the pool of sports professionals \r\nand educators with expertise in disability sports and \r\nincrease public awareness and support for our athletes. \r\nIt is a concrete step that Singapore is taking towards \r\nbuilding a more inclusive society. The master plan is \r\nalready yielding some results.\r\nAt the recent Rio Paralympic Games, Singapore was \r\nrepresented by 13 athletes across six sports, our largest-\r\never contingent. Our athletes also achieved our best-\r\never result of two gold and one bronze medals. Swimmer \r\nYip Pin Xiu won her second and third Paralympic \r\ngold medals in Rio, breaking two world records in the \r\nprocess. Fellow swimmer Theresa Goh won her first-\r\never Paralympic medal after four Paralympic Games. \r\nLike Joseph Schooling, who won Singapore’s first-ever \r\nOlympic gold medal at the Rio Olympic Games, their \r\nstories of perseverance and striving for excellence have \r\nmade them sporting heroes among many Singaporeans, \r\nand these extraordinary individuals will inspire a new \r\ngeneration of budding athletes to fulfil their aspirations \r\non a major sporting stage.\r\nMr. El Haycen (Mauritania), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAs part of our contribution to promoting a culture \r\nof sport in the region, Singapore hosted the eighth \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Para \r\nGames last December. That was the first time that \r\nSingapore hosted the Games, which included about \r\n1,400 athletes from 11 countries competing in 336 events \r\n06/12/2016 A/71/PV.52\r\n16-41516 9/13\r\nin 15 sports. The ASEAN Para Games celebrate the \r\ntriumph of the human spirit over all odds and exemplify \r\nthe Paralympic values of determination, inspiration, \r\ncourage and equality. That was also reflected in the \r\ntheme of the Games, “Celebrate the Extraordinary”, \r\nthat is, to celebrate the tremendous courage and spirit of \r\nthe para athletes, who have overcome great challenges, \r\nnot just in leading active lives but in excelling in their \r\nrespective sports.\r\nAs we continue to uphold the spirit of the Olympic \r\nTruce and implement the 2030 Agenda, Singapore \r\nfirmly believes that sport is an enduring source of \r\ninspiration for us to aim higher and do better in our \r\nefforts to build a more inclusive, sustainable and \r\nprosperous future for our people.\r\nMr. Prasad (India): India welcomed resolution \r\n70/4, entitled “Building a peaceful and better world \r\nthrough sport and the Olympic ideal” and adopted by \r\nthe General Assembly on 26 October 2015. We also \r\nwelcome the designation of 6 April as the International \r\nDay of Sport for Development and Peace.\r\nThe valuable contribution of sport in promoting \r\neducation, sustainable development, peace, cooperation, \r\nsolidarity, fairness, social inclusion and health at the \r\nlocal, regional and international levels is undeniable. \r\nIn that context, the ancient Greek tradition of the \r\nOlympic Truce underlines the recognition that sport is \r\na valuable tool for consolidating peace and solidarity, \r\nas well as tolerance and understanding among peoples \r\nand nations.\r\nWhile sporting events have on occasion been used \r\nfor political ends, including for propaganda, boycott \r\nand the like, on the whole sporting competitions have \r\noverwhelmingly served to bring people and nations \r\ntogether and uplift the human spirit collectively.\r\nIn a country such as India, our national teams \r\nin popular sports such as cricket and hockey reflect \r\nthe diversity of our population, with players who \r\nspeak different languages, profess different faiths \r\nand come from different urban or rural backgrounds \r\nplaying together as one. India’s sports policy focuses \r\non the broad-basing of sports and on upgrading and \r\ndeveloping sports infrastructure, supporting national \r\nsport federations, creating incentives to promote sport \r\nand enhance the participation of women, ethnic groups \r\nand rural youth, and promoting sport-mindedness \r\namong the public at large. That focus aims to draw \r\nmore and more youth from both cities and rural areas \r\ntowards sports and thereby provide a platform for their \r\npotential to advance social and developmental goals.\r\nA number of non-governmental organizations \r\n(NGOs), in association with local Government bodies, \r\nhave launched a series of innovative programmes aimed \r\nat social development through sports. Those initiatives, \r\na few of which we have profiled, have focused on specific \r\nareas, including education and poverty eradication. \r\nOne example is the Mumbai-based NGO Magic \r\nBus, which has been running a series of adolescent-\r\nmentoring programmes to help young persons from \r\nweak socioeconomic backgrounds to break out of the \r\ncycle of poverty. The programme has used sports in its \r\nweekly curriculum to change behaviours in the fields of \r\neducation, health and gender. Magic Bus has been able \r\nto reach more than 370,000 children across four Indian \r\nstates since its inception in the year 2000.\r\nAnother example is the NGO India Ability \r\nFoundation, which has chosen to work in the area of \r\nyouth with physical disabilities in the Indian state of \r\nRajasthan. The Foundation’s IMAGE programme \r\nbegan in 2005 and aims to drive home the importance \r\nof education and health for disabled children. In the \r\nfirst phase, the programme focused on developing \r\ncooperation and friendship among both disabled \r\nand non-disabled children by setting up common \r\nsports clubs. In the second phase of the programme, \r\nthe Foundation has trained a combined group of \r\nsuch youngsters to deliver social impact messages \r\non the importance of education and health through a \r\ncurriculum based on sports and games.\r\nIn that context, we welcome the Olympic \r\nMovement and the significant impetus that the \r\nSummer, Winter, Youth and Paralympic Games give \r\nto the task of involving youth in the development of \r\ntheir physical and mental energies and building bridges \r\nacross the world. We congratulate Brazil for hosting \r\nthe Rio Olympic Games and the Paralympics, which \r\ntook the Games to a new continent for the first time \r\nand advanced the Olympic Movement. By providing a \r\nnumber of examples of competitors helping each other \r\nand rising above the competition, the Games reiterated \r\nthat sportsmanship can build bridges among people of \r\ndifferent nationalities, religions, ethnicities, languages \r\nand cultures.\r\nWhile India is still working to improve its \r\nperformance in many of the Olympic disciplines, the \r\nrecent Rio Olympics provided a fresh crop of young \r\nA/71/PV.52 06/12/2016\r\n10/13 16-41516\r\nathletes, many of them women, who endeared themselves \r\nwith their courageous performance on the world stage, \r\ndespite the odds that they have had to face in life. From \r\nIndia’s perspective, the two biggest stars of the recently \r\nconcluded Rio Olympics of 2016 were two young sports \r\nwomen: wrestler Sakshi Malik, who won a bronze in \r\nher weight category, and Dipa Karmakar, who became \r\nthe first Indian gymnast to enter the Olympics finals. \r\nEach in her own way conveyed the exciting story of \r\nwomen’s empowerment in India.\r\nSakshi Malik, who hails from the northern state of \r\nHaryana, embodies the determination of women from \r\nthe rural areas of the state to pursue their dreams, while \r\novercoming a deeply conservative and patriarchal \r\nrural society. Sport is seen by women in that state, \r\nwhich has one of India’s most negative sex ratios, as \r\na vehicle to rewrite social norms, and Sakshi Malik is \r\na representative of that effort. Similarly, the triumph \r\nof the young gymnast Dipa Karmakar, from the border \r\nstate of Tripura, highlights the determination of young \r\nwomen from rural pockets of India to participate in \r\nsport despite the lack of opportunities and facilities for \r\nwomen, as well as the ingrained conservative social \r\nvalues. Their exploits, along with the march of India’s \r\nwomen’s badminton star Pusarla Venkata Sindhu to \r\nthe finals of the women’s badminton competition, were \r\nthe principal highlights of India’s participation in the \r\nOlympics. Their stories and exploits in the Olympics \r\nhave resonated across India, making the Rio Olympics \r\nboth a stage and a booster for women’s empowerment \r\nin India.\r\nSport is a reflection of society. The degeneration of \r\nvalues in society — violence, corruption, hooliganism, \r\ndeception and drug abuse — have also been noticed \r\nin sport. Concerted vigilance and resolute action are \r\nneeded to prevent the intrusion of those ills and to \r\nprotect the noble ideals and spirit behind the Olympic \r\nGames and other sports.\r\nSport promotes happiness and joy and, at the same \r\ntime, teaches the qualities of self-discipline, patience, \r\ntraining, skills development, cooperation, excellence \r\nand respect for one’s opponents among the players, \r\nas well as among those who follow sports. A wider \r\npursuit of sporting activities in society helps the cause \r\nof peace and development. It must be our endeavour to \r\npromote sports and a culture of sport in our countries as \r\na means of building peace, friendship, cooperation and \r\nunderstanding among peoples.\r\nMr. Tuy (Cambodia): I appreciate the comprehensive \r\nreport (A/71/179) submitted by the Secretary-General. \r\nCambodia welcomes the recognition of sport as a \r\nmomentous tool for development and peace. The \r\nimportance of sport was reaffirmed in the 2005 World \r\nSummit outcome document and in the 2010 Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals, particularly in the recognition \r\nof 6 April as the International Day of Sport for \r\nDevelopment and Peace.\r\nFrom a multidimensional perspective, Cambodia \r\nfinds that sport plays a simple and straightforward \r\nrole towards a solution for the achievement of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. The international \r\ncommunity can see that the relevance of sport in each \r\nof the 17 Sustainable Devlopment Goals (SDGs) can \r\nbe shown in areas such as lessons learned and best \r\npractices in sport for development and peace.\r\nOf the several roles that it plays in the promotion \r\nof education, health and development, sport can play \r\nan even bigger role in bringing peace to conflicting \r\ncommunities and peoples, and possibly between \r\ncountries in conflict. That is because of its universal \r\nlanguage, which can bring together and bond peoples \r\nand countries, regardless of their cultural and political \r\ndifferences, economic status or religious belief.\r\nThe growing contribution of sport has produced \r\ngood results in various countries with aboriginal peoples \r\nor young people with disabilities, as well as in conflict \r\nand post-conflict areas, and even in specific cases, \r\nsuch as preventing teenage pregnancy. Almost all the \r\nSustainable Development Goals can be reached if our \r\nwholehearted efforts and support for mainstreaming \r\nsport for development and peace could be linked to the \r\nSDGs. The Secretary-General’s report clearly spells \r\nout these initial steps, policies and programmes.\r\nThe 1960s were considered a golden era for sport \r\nin Cambodia. Unfortunately, almost three decades of \r\ncivil war and internal conflict reduced the country to \r\nruin, including in the domain of sports. Since 1998, \r\nhowever, thanks to the win-win policy introduced by \r\nPrime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen, peace has \r\nbeen fully restored throughout the country, the Royal \r\nGovernment of Cambodia has done its utmost to foster \r\nthe country’s development in every area, and sport \r\nhas started to re-emerge. Our Ministry of Education, \r\nYouth and Sports and our National Olympic Committee \r\nhave strengthened and expanded sports infrastructure \r\nat every level. Sport has been introduced into primary \r\n06/12/2016 A/71/PV.52\r\n16-41516 11/13\r\nand secondary schools, while playing fields have been \r\nrenovated and upgraded, instructors trained, sports \r\nclubs equipped and federation, school and community \r\nclubs developed.\r\nCambodia has also hosted many regional \r\ncompetitions, such as the football and taekwondo \r\nchampionships of the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations, to name only two. We also had the honour this \r\nyear of hosting the 2016 Angkor Wat international half \r\nmarathon charity race, which was held for the twenty-\r\nfirst time on 4 December at the Angkor Wat temple \r\ncomplex in Siem Reap province. Runners from all over \r\nthe world, including some with disabilities, participated \r\nin support of a ban on the manufacture and inhumane \r\nuse of anti-personnel mines.\r\nTaking a step further in the area of sports, Cambodia \r\nwill host the biennial Southeast Asian Games in 2023, \r\nand we are building the multi-million-dollar Morodok \r\nTecho national sports complex for them. In October and \r\nNovember of this year, in preparation for the Southeast \r\nAsian Games, Cambodia hosted its first national \r\nGames, bringing together thousands of athletes from \r\nacross the country. Cambodia has taken part in various \r\nregional and international competitions, including the \r\nSoutheast Asian Games and the Asian Summer, Winter, \r\nIndoor and Beach Games. Furthermore, this year \r\nthe National Olympic Committee of Cambodia sent \r\nathletes to participate in the 2016 Summer Olympics \r\nin Rio de Janeiro from 5 to 21 August, marking our \r\nsixth consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics, \r\nalthough as Kampuchea we also took part in the Games \r\nin 1956, 1964 and 1972.\r\nIn conclusion, Cambodia stands ready to cooperate \r\nwith individual countries, regional groups and \r\nstakeholders and international organizations in order to \r\nmaximize the potential of sport in relation to the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nMr. Araújo Prado (Brazil): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Brazil, who are also \r\nrepresented here by Senators Gladson Cameli, Sérgio \r\nPetecão and José Medeiros, I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to express our gratitude for the wave of \r\nsolidarity across the globe in the wake of the tragic \r\naccident that recently befell the Chapecoense team \r\nmembers, journalists and others. The demonstrations \r\nof support have helped greatly to easing the grief of the \r\nvictims’ family members and the country as a whole. \r\nThis solidarity, and the success of the Olympic and \r\nParalympic Games held this year in Rio, have once again \r\nillustrated sport’s potential for promoting empathy, \r\npeace and development. We thank all Member States \r\nand the United Nations system for their condolences \r\nand support, which is much appreciated.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): In \r\naccordance with resolution 64/3, of 19 October 2009, I \r\nnow give the f loor to the observer of the International \r\nOlympic Committee.\r\nMr. Pescante (International Olympic Committee): \r\nOn behalf of the International Olympic Committee \r\n(IOC), I would first like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive biennial report (A/71/179), \r\nwhich outlines the many ways that sport is contributing \r\nto sustainable development. We would also like \r\nto pay special tribute to Mr. Wilfried Lemke, his \r\nSpecial Adviser on Sport for Development and Peace, \r\nwhose efforts have been central to our shared tasks. \r\nThe recognition of sport as an important enabler in \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals has been \r\na milestone in our common path. The sports world is \r\nready to be a key partner in the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nOnly a few months ago, the Olympic Games in Rio \r\ndemonstrated the power of sport when a country that is \r\ndeeply divided, socially, economically and politically, \r\ncame together in a splendid moment of unity. The \r\nGames in Rio also sent a message of society’s potential \r\nfor achieving peace, tolerance and respect. The athletes \r\nof the first-ever refugee Olympic team represented \r\nsolidarity and hope for the millions of refugees around \r\nthe world. They showed the world that, even after \r\nfacing unimaginable tragedies and suffering, anyone \r\ncan contribute to society through talent, skill and, \r\nmost important, the strength of the human spirit. The \r\nGames sent a signal to the international community \r\nthat refugees can enrich society just as they do our \r\nOlympic family. The Assembly should rest assured that \r\nthe IOC’s support to the refugees remains ongoing.\r\nSport can also be a powerful tool for promoting \r\ngender equality. In that regard, while we must still \r\ncontinue to strive for progress, we are moving closer to \r\n50 per cent female participation in the Olympic Games. \r\nIn Rio de Janeiro we saw more women compete than \r\never before, accounting for 45 per cent of the athletes. \r\nOf course, gender parity at the Olympic Games alone is \r\nnot enough. Therefore, one of the legacies of the recent \r\nGames is our joint initiative with the United Nations to \r\nA/71/PV.52 06/12/2016\r\n12/13 16-41516\r\nsupport 2,500 girls across Rio de Janeiro state by using \r\nsports programmes to empower them to become future \r\nleaders in their communities.\r\nA year ago in Paris, before 1,000 mayors from around \r\nthe globe, the President of the IOC emphasized that the \r\nOlympic Games could be a catalyst for the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of cities. Beyond sustainability, in our \r\nhost-city contracts, we have made a clear commitment \r\nto increasing the protection of several aspects of human \r\nrights in the organization of the Games.\r\nMaking sport accessible to all also remains a major \r\npriority for us and is the basis of our new programme \r\nfor building safe spaces for sport around the world. This \r\ninitiative is designed to provide children with equal \r\nopportunities for playing sports in a safe environment \r\nand to place sport at the core of public policy.\r\nWith regard to the importance of sport for \r\npeacebuilding, I would like to thank the General \r\nAssembly for its work and for its adoption last year of \r\nresolution 70/4, the Olympic Truce resolution, ahead \r\nof the Rio Games. A new consultation process for an \r\nOlympic Truce draft resolution in the context of the 2018 \r\nWinter Olympic Games, to be held in Pyeongchang, \r\nwill start in the coming months, and we hope that the \r\nAssembly will support it once again.\r\nHowever, sport can succeed only if its autonomy \r\nand neutrality are respected and if there is harmonious \r\ncollaboration, synergy and mutual respect among \r\ninternational institutions, public authorities and sports \r\norganizations. At the same time, we are ready to address \r\nsome of the many challenges we face, which also means \r\ncombating doping, complying with the basic principles \r\nof good governance and increasing transparency.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to express special thanks \r\nto all the members and co-Chairs of the Group of Friends \r\nof Sport for their important support. Lastly, I would \r\nlike to reiterate to all of the countries represented here \r\nin the Assembly the IOC’s commitment to cooperation, \r\nand our determination to ensure, through all possible \r\nmeans, that the draft resolution to be adopted during \r\nthis session (A/71/L.35) will bring positive results and \r\ngenerate increased synergies and further recognition \r\nfor sport in the service of human beings.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on this item. The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 11.\r\nAgenda item 130\r\nInvestigation into the conditions and circumstances \r\nresulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjöld \r\nand of the members of the party accompanying him\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.25)\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I should \r\nlike to inform members that action on draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.25 will be postponed to a later date to allow \r\ntime for a review of its programme budget implications \r\nby the Fifth Committee.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Sweden \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/71/L.25.\r\nMr. Skoog (Sweden): I am proud to introduce today, \r\non behalf of all of the sponsors, the draft resolution \r\ncontained in document A/71/L.25, concerning the \r\ninvestigation into the conditions and circumstances \r\nresulting in the tragic death of Dag Hammarskjöld and \r\nof the members of the party accompanying him. We \r\nare very grateful to all the delegations that have joined \r\nus in that endeavour, and I would like to thank all the \r\nsponsors for their support.\r\nIn these turbulent times, our need for moral and \r\npolitical leadership is greater than ever. The role and \r\nfunction of the Secretary-General provide a unique \r\nplatform from which to exercise such authority. Dag \r\nHammarskjöld, the second Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, understood how to use that platform \r\nfor better ends. More than ever, we need to recall the \r\ndedication with which he fought for the independence \r\nof his Office, tirelessly defended the ideals of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and loyally promoted the \r\nintegrity of the Organization.\r\nMore than 50 years later, we still do not know the \r\nexact circumstances surrounding Mr. Hammarskjöld’s \r\ndeath, in Ndola on 17 September 1961. Last year, the \r\nGeneral Assembly, by consensus, adopted resolution \r\n70/11, asking the Secretary-General to pursue \r\nthe pending requests for information made by the \r\nIndependent Panel of Experts established pursuant \r\nto resolution 69/246. This summer, as a result of the \r\nSecretary-General’s efforts and the cooperation of \r\nMember States, new documents came to light regarding \r\nthe circumstances of Mr. Hammarskjöld’s death. The \r\nauthenticity of the documents still has to be determined, \r\nas does their relevance to any further investigations. \r\nSince it is our shared responsibility to pursue the full \r\n06/12/2016 A/71/PV.52\r\n16-41516 13/13\r\ntruth in this matter, it is clear that the need for additional \r\nfollow-up remains.\r\nIn the light of what I have just said, and in firm \r\nsupport of the Secretary-General’s recommendations \r\non the way forward, Sweden, together with its partners, \r\nintroduces draft resolution A/71/L.25 before the \r\nAssembly today. It has six operational elements, the most \r\nimportant of which is contained in paragraph 1. It asks \r\nthe Secretary-General to appoint an eminent person to \r\nreview the potential new information — including any \r\nthat may be available from Member States — in order \r\nto assess its probative value, determine the scope that \r\nany further inquiry or investigation should take and, \r\nif possible, draw conclusions from the investigations \r\nalready conducted. Because the draft resolution \r\nincludes a small programme budget implication, \r\nwe will take action on it once the Fifth Committee \r\nhas considered the matter, later in December. In the \r\nmeantime, the list of sponsors will remain open, and we \r\nencourage all Member States to join us and our partners \r\nin this endeavour.\r\nTime is of the essence, since with every passing \r\nyear the door is closing further on finding the truth. But \r\nour efforts must continue. We owe it to the families of \r\nthose who perished that night, to the United Nations as \r\nan Organization and to all here who strive to continue \r\nto work in Mr. Hammarskjöld’s spirit.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): The \r\nGeneral Assembly has thus concluded this stage of its \r\nconsideration of agenda item 130.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1.30 p.m.\r\n"
