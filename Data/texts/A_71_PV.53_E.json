The Committee was briefed by \r\nthe Under-Secretary-General for Communications and \r\nPublic Information concerning the measures taken by \r\nthe Department of Public Information to disseminate \r\nthe message of the United Nations around the world. \r\nThe Committee also considered a written statement of \r\nthe Joint Inspection Unit and heard a statement by the \r\nSenior Adviser on Information Management and Policy \r\nCoordination of the Secretariat of the United Nations \r\nSystem Chief Executives Board for Coordination. \r\nThe Fourth Committee adopted draft resolution \r\nA, entitled “Information in the service of humanity” \r\nwithout a vote. Operative paragraph 23 of draft resolution \r\nB, entitled “United Nations public information policies \r\nand activities” was adopted by a recorded vote, while \r\nthe draft resolution as a whole was adopted without a \r\nvote. Both draft resolutions are contained in paragraph \r\n14 of the report.\r\nWith regard to the cluster of items on the non-self-\r\ngoverning territories and the Declaration on the \r\nGranting of Independence to Colonial Countries \r\nand Peoples — agenda items 54 to 58 — the Fourth \r\nCommittee considered those five items together. The \r\nCommittee held a general debate on those issues \r\nand heard 102 petitioners on the various non-self-\r\ngoverning territories, as well as the President of French \r\nPolynesia, the Chief Minister of Gibraltar and the Vice \r\nPresident of the Government of New Caledonia. For the \r\nconsideration of those items, the General Assembly has \r\nbefore it the following five reports.\r\nWith regard to the report submitted under agenda \r\nitem 54, entitled “Information from Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories transmitted under paragraph \r\nArticle 73 e of the Charter of the United Nations”, \r\ncontained in document A/71/498; the report submitted \r\nunder agenda item 55, entitled “Economic and other \r\nactivities which affect the interests of the peoples of \r\nthe Non-Self-Governing Territories”, contained in \r\ndocument A/71/499; the report submitted under agenda \r\nitem 56, entitled “Implementation of the Declaration \r\non the Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries \r\nand Peoples by the specialized agencies and the \r\ninternational institutions associated with the United \r\n06/12/2016 A/71/PV.53\r\n16-41522 3/17\r\nNations”, contained in document A/71/500; and the \r\nreport submitted under agenda item 57, entitled “Offers \r\nby Member States of study and training facilities \r\nfor inhabitants of Non-Self-Governing Territories”, \r\ncontained in document A/71/501, the corresponding \r\ndraft resolutions are contained in paragraph 7 of each of \r\nthe relevant reports. The report submitted under agenda \r\nitem 58, entitled “Implementation of the Declaration on \r\nthe Granting of Independence to Colonial Countries and \r\nPeoples” is contained in document A/71/502. Under that \r\nitem, the Fourth Committee adopted seventeen draft \r\nresolutions and a draft decision on issues relating to the \r\nimplementation of the Declaration and the Non-Self-\r\nGoverning Territories, as contained in paragraphs 41 \r\nand 42 of the report.\r\nWith regard to item 121, “Revitalization of the \r\nwork of the General Assembly”, the report containing \r\nthe proposed programme of work and timetable for the \r\nFourth Committee for the Assembly’s seventy-second \r\nsession is contained in document A/71/503. The Fourth \r\nCommittee recommends the draft decision contained in \r\nparagraph 5 to the General Assembly for adoption.\r\nThe need did not arise for the Fourth Committee to \r\ntake up item 135, “Programme planning”, at this stage, \r\nas indicated in the report of the Fourth Committee \r\ncontained in document A/71/504.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to recall the high \r\nlevel of cooperation prevailing in the Special Political \r\nand Decolonization Committee. The Committee was \r\nable to fulfill the mandate entrusted to it by the the \r\nGeneral Assembly and completed its work effectively \r\nand constructively within the time allotted by the \r\nAssembly. On behalf of the Bureau of the Committee, \r\nI would like to express our sincere appreciation to \r\nall delegations for their constructive participation \r\nin this session. I should like to pay particular tribute \r\nto the Chair of the Fourth Committee, Mr. Vladimir \r\nDrobnjak of Croatia, whose knowledge and experience \r\nin multilateral forums, enhanced by his consummate \r\ndiplomatic skills, enabled the Fourth Committee to \r\nconsider in depth all the agenda items allocated to it.\r\nThe other members of the Bureau of the \r\nFourth Committee with whom I had the pleasure \r\nof working — Mr. Hossein Maleki of the Islamic \r\nRepublic of Iran, Mr. Wouter Poels of Belgium and \r\nMr. Juan Antonio Benard Estrada of Guatemala — also \r\ncontributed greatly to the successful conclusion of the \r\nwork of the Fourth Committee. I would also like to put \r\non record our appreciation for the able and effective \r\nassistance provided by Ms. Christa Giles, the Secretary \r\nof the Committee, and her team from the Department \r\nfor General Assembly and Conference Management.\r\nI now have the honour to submit to the General \r\nAssembly for its consideration and adoption the draft \r\nresolutions and draft decisions recommended by the \r\nSpecial Political and Decolonization Committee in its \r\nreport in documents A/71/491 to A/71/504.\r\nThe President: I thank the Rapporteur of the \r\nSpecial Political and Decolonization Committee \r\n(Fourth Committee) for his introduction of the \r\nCommittee’s reports.\r\nIf there is no proposal under rule 66 of the rules \r\nof procedure, I shall take it that the General Assembly \r\ndecides not to discuss the reports of the Special Political \r\nand Decolonization Committee, which are before the \r\nGeneral Assembly today.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Statements will therefore be limited \r\nto explanations of vote.\r\nBefore proceeding further, I wish to consult \r\nmembers about how I intend to proceed to refer to the \r\nreports of the Committee. In order to save time, and \r\ngiven that this afternoon the Assembly is taking up only \r\nthe reports of the Special Political and Decolonization \r\nCommittee (Fourth Committee), I will only mention \r\nthe term “the Committee” on the understanding that \r\nthe formal name of the Committee, the Special Political \r\nand Decolonization Committee, will be reflected in the \r\nofficial records.\r\nAs I hear no objection, we shall proceed accordingly.\r\nThe positions of delegations regarding the \r\nrecommendations of the Fourth Committee have been \r\nmade clear in the Fourth Committee and are reflected \r\nin the relevant official records.\r\nMay I remind members that in accordance with \r\nparagraph 7 of decision 34/401, the General Assembly \r\nagreed that when the same draft resolution is considered \r\nin a Main Committee and in plenary meeting, a \r\ndelegation should, as far as possible, explain its vote \r\nonly once, that is, either in the Committee or in the \r\nplenary meeting, unless that delegation’s vote in plenary \r\nmeeting is different from its vote in the Committee.\r\nA/71/PV.53 06/12/2016\r\n4/17 16-41522\r\nMay I further remind delegations that, also in \r\naccordance with decision 34/401, explanations of \r\nvote are limited to 10 minutes and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nBefore we begin to take action on the \r\nrecommendations contained in the reports of the Fourth \r\nCommittee, I should like to advise representatives that \r\nwe are going to take decisions in the same manner as \r\nwas done in the Fourth Committee unless the secretariat \r\nis notified to the contrary in advance. That means that, \r\nwhere recorded votes were taken, we will do the same. I \r\nshould also hope that we will proceed to adopt without a \r\nvote those recommendations that were adopted without \r\na vote in the Fourth Committee.\r\nI would like to draw the attention of members to a \r\nnote by the Secretariat, entitled “Checklist of reports \r\nof the Special Political and Decolonization Committee \r\n(Fourth Committee) to the General Assembly on \r\nagenda items 47 to 58, 121 to 135”, which has been \r\ncirculated, in English only, as document A/C.4/71/\r\nINF/3. The note has been distributed desk to desk in the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall as a reference guide for action \r\non draft resolutions and decisions recommended by the \r\nCommittee in its reports. In that connection, members \r\nwill find, in column 4 of the note, the symbols of the \r\ndraft resolutions and decisions of the Committee, with \r\nthe corresponding symbols of the reports for action \r\nin the plenary meeting in column 2 of the same note. \r\nFor reports containing multiple recommendations, the \r\ndraft resolution or decision number is contained in \r\ncolumn 3 of the note. For reports containing multiple \r\nrecommendations, the draft resolution or decision \r\nnumber is contained in column 3 of the note.\r\nFurthermore, members are reminded that additional \r\nsponsors are no longer accepted now that the draft \r\nresolutions and decisions have been adopted by the \r\nCommittee. Any clarification about sponsorship should \r\nbe addressed to the Secretary of the Committee. I \r\nwould also like to remind members that any corrections \r\nto the voting intention of delegations after the voting \r\nhas concluded on a proposal should be made directly \r\nto the secretariat at the end of the meeting. I seek the \r\ncooperation of members in avoiding any interruptions \r\nto our proceedings in that regard.\r\nAgenda item 47\r\nEffects of atomic radiation\r\nReport of the Special Political and Decolonization \r\nCommittee (Fourth Committee) (A/71/491)\r\nThe President: The Assembly has before it a draft \r\nresolution recommended by the Fourth Committee in \r\nparagraph 8 of its report. The Committee adopted it \r\nwithout a vote. May I take it that the Assembly wishes \r\nto do the same?\r\nThe draft resolution was adopted (resolution 71/89).\r\nThe President: The General Assembly has thus \r\nconcluded its consideration of agenda item 47.\r\nAgenda item 48\r\nInternational cooperation in the peaceful uses of \r\nouter space\r\nReport of the Special Political and Decolonization \r\nCommittee (Fourth Committee) (A/71/492)\r\nThe President: The Assembly has before it a draft \r\nresolution recommended by the Fourth Committee in \r\nparagraph 9 of its report.
