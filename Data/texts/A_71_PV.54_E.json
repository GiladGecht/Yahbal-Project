"United Nations A/71/PV.54\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n54th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 7 December 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 73\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.27)\r\n(a) Oceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/71/74 and \r\nA/71/74/Add.1)\r\nReport on the work of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup of the Whole on the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting and Assessment of the \r\nState of the Marine Environment, including \r\nSocioeconomic Aspects (A/71/362)\r\nReport on the work of the United Nations Open-\r\nended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans \r\nand the Law of the Sea at its seventeenth \r\nmeeting (A/71/204)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.26)\r\n(b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the \r\n1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the \r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating \r\nto the Conservation and Management of \r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory \r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/351)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.24)\r\nThe President: I should like to inform members \r\nthat action on draft resolution A/71/L.26, entitled \r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”, has been postponed to a \r\nlater date to allow time for the review of its programme \r\nbudget implications by the Fifth Committee.\r\nI shall now make a brief statement.\r\nThe ocean is the lifeblood of our planet. It is a vital \r\nand complex ecosystem that billions of people depend \r\non for their livelihoods, food security, cultural identity \r\nand traditions. We are all united by the ocean with its \r\nboundless energy, indispensable trade routes and its \r\nmarine resources that feed our communities. As we \r\nmeet, however, our beloved ocean is in peril and the \r\nstate of its health has begun to threaten humankind’s \r\nsustainable place on this planet. The overexploitation \r\nof fish stocks and pollution from fertilizers, plastics \r\nand waste are diminishing its resources, while climate \r\nchange is exerting enormous pressure on the ocean, \r\ncoasts and marine ecosystems. Rising sea levels, \r\nocean acidification, increasing deoxygenization and \r\nreduced mixing of ocean waters are exacerbating those \r\nchallenges, while the changing interaction between \r\nthe ocean and the atmosphere is affecting our climate, \r\nweather and air quality.\r\nThe importance of the ocean to humankind and \r\nto the planet was acknowledged by world leaders \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The 2030 Agenda critically \r\nincluded Sustainable Development Goal 14, which \r\naims to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas \r\nand marine resources for sustainable development. It \r\npursues urgent action to reverse the cycle of decline in \r\nwhich our ocean is currently caught.\r\nThe General Assembly has a central role to play in \r\nprotecting the ocean and its resources. The resolutions \r\nthat have been considered and adopted under the oceans \r\nagenda are essential to those efforts. I would like to \r\nhighlight the following key observations about the draft \r\nresolutions before us. The annual oceans omnibus draft \r\nresolution (A/71/L.26) reflects the critical importance \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. I \r\nwelcome its focus on important broad-ranging issues \r\nrelating to the ocean and the law of the sea and the \r\ncentral importance that it gives to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. That includes \r\ncapacity-building, the peaceful settlement of disputes, \r\nthe work of the International Seabed Authority, \r\nmaritime safety and security, marine environment and \r\nresources, the protection of refugees and migrants at \r\nsea, and the safety of fishers and vessels.\r\nThe decision to focus the annual Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the \r\nLaw of the Sea on climate change and oceans in 2017 \r\nand on anthropogenic underwater noise in 2018 is \r\nwelcome. Also welcome is the importance placed on \r\nthe First Global Integrated Marine Assessment for the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda, and the work on \r\nthe second cycle of the Regular Process for Global \r\nReporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine \r\nEnvironment, including Socioeconomic Aspects.\r\nI also join in encouraging delegations to continue \r\nthe high levels of good will and momentum for the first \r\nand second sessions of the Preparatory Committee for \r\nthe development of an international legally binding \r\ninstrument under the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biological diversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdictions. The annual sustainable fisheries \r\ndraft resolution (A/71/L.24) highlights the nexus \r\nbetween that issue and food security, prosperity and \r\npoverty reduction for current and future generations. \r\nI share delegations’ concerns, as expressed in the draft \r\nresolution, that illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing constitutes a serious threat to fish stocks, \r\nmarine habitats and ecosystems, and that efforts \r\nto deter and combat such fishing must be renewed. \r\nThe draft resolution that will be adopted later today, \r\ndeclares 2 May annual World Tuna Day and is therefore \r\nan important step in recognizing the critical role of tuna \r\nto sustainable development, food security, economic \r\nopportunity and the livelihoods of so many around \r\nour planet.\r\nThe high-level United Nations Conference to \r\nSupport the Implementation of Sustainable Development \r\nGoal (SDG) 14, to be held here in New York from \r\n5 to 9 June 2017, is the next milestone in our collective \r\nefforts to save the ocean. The Conference will bring \r\ntogether all stakeholders, Governments, civil society, \r\nscientific and academic experts and local communities \r\nin our collective endeavour. I am confident that, under \r\nthe able leadership of Sweden and Fiji, as co-presidents \r\nof the Conference, and of Portugal and Singapore, as \r\nco-facilitators of the call to action, the Conference \r\non Oceans and Seas will indeed be a game changer \r\nin securing the political and voluntary commitments, \r\nthe launching of the strategic multi-stakeholder \r\npartnerships and the mobilization of the global ocean \r\ncommunity to drive action to effectively implement \r\nSDG 14 by 2030. I encourage everyone to participate \r\nin the preparatory meetings for the Conference, \r\nwhich will be held on 15-16 February. I encourage all \r\nGovernments to participate in the Conference itself in \r\nJune at the highest level. During that week, we will also \r\nbe celebrating World Environment Day on 5 June and \r\nWorld Oceans Day on 8 June.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to acknowledge and \r\nthank the co-chairs, who have led the processes under \r\nthis agenda item, including Barbados, New Zealand, \r\nCyprus, Peru and Trinidad and Tobago. I would also like \r\nto thank Norway, South Africa and Nauru, on behalf of \r\nthe Pacific island developing States, for their work and \r\ndedication as coordinators of the draft resolutions.\r\nI now give the f loor to the representative of Norway \r\nto introduce draft resolution A/71/L.24.\r\nMr. Kravik (Norway): Norway had the honour \r\nto coordinate the informal consultations on draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.24, on sustainable fisheries, and \r\nis pleased to introduce that text on behalf of all its \r\nsponsors. This year’s text is a further step forward in \r\nthe conservation and management of fisheries, which \r\nare an essential resource for sustainable development.\r\nMy delegation is also pleased to join many others in \r\nsponsoring draft resolution A/71/L.26, entitled “Oceans \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 3/29\r\nand the law of the sea”, to be introduced by Thembile \r\nJoyini of South Africa. We compliment Mr. Joyini on \r\nhis careful stewardship of that draft.\r\nThe fisheries draft resolution addresses important \r\nissues such as achieving sustainable fisheries, \r\ncombating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing, \r\naddressing fishing overcapacity and improving \r\nsubregional and regional cooperation so as to achieve \r\nsustainable fisheries management. It also addresses \r\nissues undertaken in other United Nations forums, such \r\nas the workshop on bottom fisheries in August and \r\nthe resumed Review Conference in May on the 1995 \r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation \r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \r\nMigratory Fish Stocks. Key outcomes from other \r\nforums, both regional and global, are also considered \r\nin the draft resolution.\r\nThis year’s informal consultations also considered \r\nthe impact of bottom fishing on vulnerable marine \r\necosystems and the long-term sustainability of deep-sea \r\nfish stocks, as mandated in paragraph 162 of resolution \r\n69/109. The review was undertaken with a view to \r\nensuring the effective implementation of the measures \r\ntherein and to make further recommendations, where \r\nnecessary. Delegations agreed on new provisions to \r\nenhance the regulations of bottom-fishing activities. \r\nNotably, the draft further highlights the importance \r\nof adequate conservation and management measures \r\nto prevent significant adverse impacts from bottom \r\nfishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems. The draft \r\ntext articulates urgent actions that States and regional \r\nfisheries-management organizations have to take in \r\nthat regard.\r\nFurthermore, this year’s draft resolution encourages \r\nnecessary measures, where appropriate, consistent with \r\ninternational law, in order to prevent and deter vessels \r\nwithout nationality from engaging in or supporting \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. Such \r\nvessels operate on the high seas without governance or \r\noversight. That reflects the international community’s \r\nongoing concern over the negative impact of illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing on the sustainable \r\nmanagement of fish stocks and its recognition that \r\nthere is a shared responsibility to address that issue. \r\nThe draft resolution also emphasizes the central \r\nimportance of providing a safe working environment \r\nfor those engaged both in fishing activities and in \r\nmonitoring compliance.\r\nThe draft resolution also urges States parties to \r\nthe United Nations Fish Stocks Agreement to take \r\ninto account the special requirements of developing \r\nStates, including small island developing States, when \r\ncooperating to establish conservation and management \r\nmeasures for straddling fish stocks and highly \r\nmigratory fish stocks.\r\nNorway is of the firm view that the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea provides the universal \r\nand unified framework for the peaceful, responsible \r\nand predictable management of the oceans and seas. \r\nAll activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out \r\nwithin that framework. In ever-changing conditions, \r\nthe Convention provides clarity with regard to both the \r\nobligations and the rights of States.\r\nClear maritime boundaries are essential for \r\nidentifying which State has rights and obligations in \r\nwhich areas under the law of the sea. The establishment \r\nof the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 \r\nnautical miles is of key importance in that regard. The \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf also \r\nplays a significant role in that work.\r\nThis year, Norway is pleased to be able to make a \r\ncontribution to the voluntary trust fund for the purpose \r\nof defraying the cost of participation of the members \r\nof the Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf from developing States in the meetings of the \r\nCommission. We encourage other States to also \r\nconsider contributing to that fund.\r\nAs coordinator, I would like to personally thank \r\nDirector Gabriele Goettsche-Wanli and the staff of the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for \r\ntheir expertise, professionalism and invaluable support \r\non both draft resolutions. And we again thank Thembile \r\nJoyini of South Africa for his expert coordination of the \r\ndraft resolution on oceans and the law of the sea. Let me \r\nalso thank Alice Revell of New Zealand for her work in \r\nsuccessfully coordinating the fisheries resolution over \r\nthe past four years.\r\nFinally, let me conclude by conveying Norway’s \r\nappreciation for the hard work and cooperation of \r\ndelegations in crafting both draft resolutions. It is \r\nour hope that that constructive and collaborative \r\nengagement will be maintained as we continue to \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n4/29 16-41791\r\naddress the numerous and complex issues that face our \r\noceans and fisheries.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to the \r\nrepresentative of South Africa to introduce draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.26.\r\nMr. Joyini (South Africa): As the Assembly is \r\naware, South Africa has the honour to coordinate the \r\ninformal consultations on draft resolution A/71/L.26, \r\nentitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”, and is now \r\npleased to introduce the draft resolution on behalf of all \r\nits sponsors and other delegations in general.\r\nThis important exercise on the General Assembly’s \r\nagenda would not have been possible without the \r\nsupport of all delegations, which have demonstrated \r\ntremendous cooperation and f lexibility as they pursued \r\nand defended their national interests during the two \r\nrounds of negotiations of five days each, which ended \r\non 22 November. As the coordinator, I would be remiss \r\nif I did not also acknowledge the support provided \r\nto me during the negotiations and the intersessional \r\nperiod by the Director and the staff of the Division for \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, which provided \r\nsecretariat services and advice to the coordinator \r\nthroughout the process.\r\nSouth Africa is also pleased to be one of the countries \r\nthat has sponsored the draft resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/71/L.24), which was just introduced this \r\nmorning by my friend Mr. Andreas Kravik of Norway. \r\nMy delegation extends its compliments to him on his \r\ncareful stewardship of the informal consultations on \r\nthe draft resolution on sustainable fisheries. It was \r\nwell done.\r\nReturning to the omnibus draft resolution on \r\noceans and the law of the sea, draft resolution A/71/L.26 \r\nbefore us recognizes the important contribution of \r\nthe sustainable development and management of \r\nthe resources and uses of the oceans and seas to the \r\nachievement of international development goals, in \r\nparticular those contained in the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. As such, it calls upon \r\nStates to implement the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals outlined in the outcome document of the United \r\nNations summit leading to the adoption of the post-\r\n2015 development agenda, entitled “Transforming our \r\nworld: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development”, \r\nas adopted by the General Assembly in resolution \r\n70/1, of 25 September 2015, which includes Goal 14 \r\non the conservation and sustainable use the oceans, \r\nseas and marine resources for sustainable development \r\nand recalls that the Goals and targets are integrated \r\nand indivisible.\r\nIt welcomes the outcomes of the second session \r\nof the United Nations Environment Assembly, held \r\nin September 2016, especially the resolutions on the \r\n“Oceans and seas” (UNEA-2/10), “Marine plastic \r\nlitter and micro-plastics” (UNEA-2/11), “Sustainable \r\ncoral reefs management” (UNEA-2/12) and the “Role, \r\nfunctions and modalities for the United Nations \r\nEnvironment Programme implementation of the \r\nSAMOA Pathway as a means of facilitating achievement \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals” (UNEA-2/4).\r\nIt recalls the annual General Assembly resolutions \r\non the law of the sea and on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea, including resolution 69/292, of 19 June 2015, on \r\nthe development of an internationally legally binding \r\ninstrument under the Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine \r\nbiological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, \r\nand its decision to convene the high-level United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation \r\nof Sustainable Development Goal 14: Conserve and \r\nsustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources \r\nfor sustainable development, to be held from 5 to 9 June \r\n2017, coinciding with the World Oceans Day on 8 June \r\nin order to support the implementation of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14, as well as its resolution 70/303 on \r\nthe modalities for that Conference. It also acknowledges \r\nthe rich discussions and exchanges of views at the first \r\nand second sessions of the Preparatory Committee, \r\nestablished by resolution 69/292, held from 28 March to \r\n8 April and from 26 August to 9 September, and notes, \r\nin that regard, that the third and fourth sessions of the \r\nPreparatory Committee are scheduled to take place \r\nin 2017.\r\nThe draft resolution before us welcomes the progress \r\nof the work of the International Seabed Authority \r\non the exploitation regulations, in particular the \r\ndelivery of the initial working draft of the exploitation \r\nregulations during the twenty-second session of the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority, while taking note \r\nthat all State parties and other stakeholders have been \r\ninvited to provide input into the draft and encourages \r\nthe Authority to continue its work on the exploitation \r\nregulations as a matter of priority and in accordance \r\nwith the list of priority deliverables endorsed by the \r\nCouncil of the International Seabed Authority.\r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 5/29\r\nIt also welcomes with satisfaction the fact that \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea \r\nis commemorating the twentieth anniversary of its \r\nestablishment and welcomes the commemorative events, \r\nincluding the twentieth anniversary commemorative \r\nceremony and the twentieth anniversary seminar, held \r\nin Hamburg from 5 to 7 October, and expresses its \r\nappreciation to those who have contributed. It further \r\nnotes with satisfaction the progress in the work of the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nand the fact that it is currently giving consideration to \r\na number of submissions regarding the establishment \r\nof the outer limits of the continental shelf beyond 200 \r\nnautical miles.\r\nThe draft resolution recalls the responsibilities \r\nand functions entrusted to the Secretary-General by \r\nthe Convention and the related General Assembly \r\nresolutions, including resolutions 49/28 and 52/26, and \r\nnotes the increased number of requests to the Division \r\nfor the additional output and service of meetings, \r\npursuant to resolution 69/292 and in relation to the \r\nsupport to be provided by the Division as the secretariat \r\nof the Regular Process for Global Reporting and \r\nAssessment of the State of the Marine Environment, \r\nIncluding Socioeconomic Aspects, during the second \r\ncycle of the Regular Process and to ensure the \r\nallocation of appropriate resources to the Division for \r\nthe performance of its activities, under the approved \r\nbudget of the Organization.\r\nIt also recognizes the importance of the trust funds \r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 55/7 to facilitate the \r\nparticipation of members of the Commission on the \r\nLimitations of the Continental Shelf from developing \r\nStates in the meetings of the Commission and in \r\nfulfilling the requirements of article 6 of annex II to \r\nthe Convention, noting with appreciation the recent \r\ncontributions made to them, while observing with \r\nconcern that the lack of funds in the voluntary trust fund \r\nfor the purpose of defraying the cost of the participation \r\nof the members of the Commission on the Limits of \r\nContinental Shelf from developing States in the meetings \r\nof the Commission may prevent the Commission from \r\nimplementing the decision of the twenty-sixth meeting \r\nof State parties that requested the Commission to meet \r\nfor up to 26 weeks and may preclude the Commission \r\nfrom advancing its work as a result of the potential \r\nlack of a quorum at the 2017 session. In that regard, \r\nwe urge States, international financial institutions, \r\ndonor agencies, intergovernmental organizations, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and natural and \r\njuridical persons to contribute to the aforementioned \r\ntrust fund. We express our appreciation to those who \r\nhave contributed.\r\nIn conclusion, following 10 days of intensive \r\nnegotiations, including a series of small-group and \r\nbilateral meetings, delegations were able to reach \r\nconsensus on each paragraph of the draft resolution, \r\nwhich seeks to assist Member States and other entities \r\nin implementing the obligations geared towards, inter \r\nalia, the sustainable use of our oceans and seas. I am \r\ntherefore pleased to commit the draft resolution to \r\nthe Assembly for its consideration. It is my hope that \r\nthe same spirit of cooperation and understanding that \r\ncharacterized the negotiations will be demonstrated \r\nby delegations and that draft resolution A/71/L.26 will \r\nbe adopted by consensus when the time for adoption \r\ncomes.\r\nMr. Otto (Palau): I have the honour to deliver this \r\nstatement on behalf of the 12 members of the Pacific \r\nsmall island developing States, namely, the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New \r\nGuinea, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Solomon Islands, \r\nTonga, Tuvalu, Vanuatu and my own country, Palau, to \r\nintroduce the draft resolution contained in document \r\nA/71/L.27, entitled “World Tuna Day” under agenda \r\nitem 73 on the oceans and the law of the sea, and to \r\nmove it to action. Owing to time constraints, a longer \r\nversion of my statement will be circulated to the wider \r\nmembership.\r\nWe are pleased that currently 93 countries from \r\nall regions of the world have joined us in sponsoring \r\nthe draft resolution to declare 2 May as World Tuna \r\nDay. We would therefore like to express our profound \r\nappreciation to all the delegations that have sponsored \r\nthe draft resolution. We humbly invite other delegations \r\nto join in sponsorship before adoption today.\r\nThe draft resolution for World Tuna Day, under \r\nconsideration today, underscores the critical importance \r\nof tuna for the social and economic welfare of many \r\nStates, as those fish support some of the world’s largest \r\nand most valuable fisheries, as well as of the many people \r\nwho rely on them for their livelihoods. World Tuna Day \r\nis intended to create global awareness regarding the \r\nvalue and importance of tuna to the multitude of lives \r\nand livelihoods around the world and its contribution to \r\nthe attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nunder the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n6/29 16-41791\r\nas well as the critical role that tuna plays in marine \r\necosystems.\r\nThe global economic activity that tuna fisheries can \r\ndirectly and indirectly generate is remarkable. Every \r\nyear, at least 2.5 million tons of global tuna catch is \r\ndestined for the canning industry and globally around \r\n256 million cases are consumed, valued at $7.5 billion. \r\nTherefore, ensuring the long-term sustainability of \r\nthe world’s tuna and billfish fisheries is intrinsically \r\nlinked with providing food security, vital livelihoods \r\nand economic benefits in many regions of the world. \r\nIn my own region, tuna has for centuries provided \r\nan important source of food for Pacific Islanders and \r\nemployment, as well as much intangible cultural and \r\ntraditional value to our peoples.\r\nToday, tuna fishing is also an important source \r\nof income, and for some of our members, the tuna \r\nresources within their 200-mile exclusive economic \r\nzones represent their only significant renewable \r\nresource and their best opportunity for sustainable \r\neconomic development. In addition to the critical \r\neconomic value of tuna, it plays an important role in the \r\nmarine ecosystem. The declining tuna population and \r\nchanges in their food-web dynamics may impair the \r\noceans’ capacity to generate basic ecosystem services, \r\nwhich are vital to human health, welfare and economic \r\nactivities.\r\nDespite their importance, tuna face serious \r\nchallenges to their long-term sustainability. There are \r\nmore hooks and nets set in the oceans for tuna than any \r\nother group of fish. And as we have noted at the United \r\nNations and in other forums, the issues surrounding tuna \r\ninclude the overcapacity of fishing f leets, the equitable \r\nallocation of fishing rights among fishing nations, the \r\nimplementation of the precautionary approach and the \r\necosystem approach, and efforts to combat illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. In order to \r\nhave healthy populations of tuna in the future, we need \r\nto strengthen our efforts to end overfishing and IUU \r\nfishing, and also to ensure that the gear used in tuna \r\nfishing does not endanger other ocean life.\r\nThose issues, among others, were the drivers for the \r\nparties to narrow the tuna fishing agreements in 2011 \r\nand to designate 2 May as World Tuna Day. We were \r\npleased to celebrate it with friends here at the United \r\nNations for the first time earlier this year. Given the \r\nwork that is being undertaken on the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, especially Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 14 — to conserve and sustainably use the \r\noceans and seas and marine resources for sustainable \r\ndevelopment — it is an opportune time to underscore \r\nthe centrality of tuna for global food-security and \r\nsustainable-development aspirations, as well as to take \r\nthe opportunity to showcase and share best practices \r\non sustainable tuna conservation, use and management. \r\nAnd we are pleased that such a day will now be marked \r\nby the world as well. World Tuna Day is therefore \r\nnecessary so as to protect such a magnificent species \r\nand protect our oceans and seas and the millions of \r\npeople who rely on them. We celebrate tuna now and \r\nlook forward to doing so well into the future. We look \r\nforward to adopting the draft resolution by consensus \r\ntoday.\r\nAllow me to continue with general remarks on \r\nagenda item 73, entitled “Oceans and the law of the sea”. \r\nAt the outset, we, the Pacific small island developing \r\nStates, would like to thank Mr. Thembile Joyini of \r\nSouth Africa and Mr. Andreas Kravik of Norway for \r\ntheir able leadership in bringing the negotiations on \r\nthe draft resolutions to their successful conclusion, \r\nand we are pleased to support the adoption of the draft \r\nresolutions on oceans and the law of the sea, sustainable \r\nfisheries and World Tuna Day.\r\nWe attach particular importance to this agenda \r\nitem. We consider the ocean to be the lifeblood of our \r\neconomies and societies. We are therefore keenly aware \r\nof the increasing negative impacts on the health of \r\noceans, which is driven by human activity. Overfishing \r\nand illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing; marine \r\npollution, including from microplastics, the destruction \r\nof marine habitats and other threats to marine \r\nbiodiversity, as well as climate-change-driven impacts, \r\nsuch as ocean acidification, are among a number of \r\nserious threats to the health and resilience of our shared \r\nocean.\r\nThose serious and increasing impacts are not \r\nmerely threats to our oceans, but constitute a serious \r\nchallenge to our sustainable development and our \r\nability to meet the aspirations encompassed in the 2030 \r\nAgenda. Healthy, productive and resilient oceans and \r\nseas are critical for, inter alia, poverty eradication, \r\naccess to sufficient, safe and nutritious food, economic \r\ndevelopment and essential ecosystem services.\r\nThe Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) \r\nwere at the forefront of those advocating for the \r\ninclusion in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 7/29\r\nof a stand-alone Goal dedicated to the conservation \r\nand the sustainable use of our oceans and seas. We \r\ntherefore welcome the inclusion of SDG 14 in the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. We look forward \r\nto beginning the critical work of implementing that \r\nGoal in order to meet the targets on protecting marine \r\necosystems, addressing acidification, ending illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing and increasing \r\nbenefits to SIDS and the least-developed-countries \r\n(LDCs). In that regard, we welcome the follow-up to \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, including the first high-level United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14. We congratulate \r\nthe co-facilitators of that process, the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Portugal and Singapore, and we look \r\nforward to working closely with them so as to ensure a \r\nstrong and successful conference.\r\nWe were not alone in reacting with deep concern to \r\nrecent reports that marine biodiversity has undergone \r\nconsiderable decline over the past 40 years. Populations \r\nof marine vertebrates have been declining at a rate of \r\n49 per cent, with some declining at rates near 75 per \r\ncent. Given the critical role that oceans and the health \r\nof the oceans play in our societies and our development, \r\nthat news is stark indeed. That is especially true when \r\nit is coupled with the increasing adverse impacts \r\nthat climate change and carbon-dioxide emissions \r\nare having on our oceans and seas. We are therefore \r\npleased that, in next year’s United Nations Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea, we will bring focused attention to the issue \r\nof climate change and oceans.\r\nIn a similar vein, we note that reports addressed \r\nto the United Nations World Ocean Assessment lend \r\nurgency to the work undertaken by the Preparatory \r\nCommittee to develop a legally binding instrument \r\nunder the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea on the conservation and sustainable use of marine \r\nbiodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. We \r\nbelieve that progress is being made in that work, and \r\nwe look forward to concluding a successful Preparatory \r\nCommittee with the two sessions that we have scheduled \r\nfor 2017.\r\nAs we continue to acknowledge the contributions \r\nfrom the International Seabed Authority to the ongoing \r\ncapacity-building initiatives targeting developing \r\ncountries and look forward to further progress on the \r\ndevelopment of a comprehensive set of rules governing \r\nseabed mining so as to ensure the effective protection \r\nof the marine environment from harmful effects that \r\nmight arise from the activities in the area. We have \r\nstated on numerous occasions how important the work \r\nof the Authority is to the Pacific SIDS, as our exclusive \r\neconomic zones amount to more than 30 million square \r\nkilometres and directly adjoin the lucrative Clipperton \r\nFracture Zone. We also acknowledge the important \r\ncontribution of the Commission on the Limits of the \r\nContinental Shelf. We therefore welcome the steps taken \r\nto ensure that developing States, especially LDCs and \r\nSIDS, are able to fully participate in the deliberations \r\nof subcommissions if they wish.\r\nThe importance of healthy fisheries to our \r\neconomies and livelihoods cannot be overstated. The \r\nPacific has been a site of global leadership in investing \r\nin the management of fisheries and in the monitoring \r\nof control and surveillance activities. Nonetheless, that \r\nwork does not take place in a vacuum. We reiterate \r\nour call regarding the need to provide accurate, \r\ncomplete and reliable data in order to support scientific \r\nstock assessment and ecosystem approaches to the \r\nmanagement of fisheries. We also emphasize, as we \r\ndid at the Review Conference, that the need for target \r\nreference points in the management of fish stocks will \r\nhelp enable the long-term sustainable exploitation of \r\nsuch stocks and that the obligation to ensure that a \r\ndisproportionate burden of conservation action is not \r\ntransferred to developing countries, including SIDS. \r\nWe would like to thank the Office for Ocean Affairs \r\nand the Law of the Sea for their ongoing hard work and \r\nsupport, especially relating to capacity-building, and \r\ntheir technical support and legal advice.\r\nThe President: I give the f loor to the observer of \r\nthe European Union.\r\nMs. Adamson (European Union): I am speaking \r\non behalf of the European Union (EU) and its \r\nmember States. The candidate countries, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia \r\nand Albania, the country of the Stabilization and \r\nAssociation Process and potential candidate Bosnia and \r\nHerzegovina, as well as the Republic of Moldova, align \r\nthemselves with this statement.\r\nWe are meeting here to adopt two important \r\ndraft resolutions: one on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea (A/71/L.26) and the other on sustainable fisheries \r\n(A/71/L.24). The EU and its member States have \r\nparticipated actively in the consultations preparing \r\nthose draft resolutions as committed parties to the \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n8/29 16-41791\r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and its \r\nimplementing agreements, including the Agreement for \r\nthe Implementation of the Law of the Sea Convention \r\nrelating to the Conservation and Management of \r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks. We believe that the draft resolutions serve \r\nto focus the attention of the General Assembly and \r\nthe general public on important issues in the marine \r\ndomain, including fisheries.\r\nWe would like to express our appreciation for \r\nthe excellent stewardship demonstrated by both \r\ncoordinators. We would also like to thank all of the \r\nco-Chairs and facilitators of the various meetings \r\nthat fed into the draft resolution preparation process \r\nand whose work facilitates the work of delegations. \r\nWe also recognize the constructive participation of \r\nother delegations in the negotiations, which ensured a \r\npositive outcome in both cases, with the inclusion of \r\nnumerous important and topical issues.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea, with its 168 parties, including the EU, is rightly \r\nconsidered, including by the EU and its member \r\nStates, as the constitution of the oceans, reflecting \r\nalso customary international law and establishing the \r\noverarching legal framework within which all activities \r\nin the oceans and seas must be carried out. We sincerely \r\nhope that the goal of universal participation in the \r\nConvention will one day be met. In that respect, we \r\nwelcome the accession of Azerbaijan to the Convention \r\nearlier this year.\r\nThe EU and its member States also support the \r\nneed to enhance ocean governance as a fundamental \r\ncornerstrone for preserving and protecting the marine \r\nenvironment and biodiversity, and ensuring sustainable \r\ndevelopment, as well as peaceful relations between \r\nStates. We continue to subscribe to the vital importance \r\nof preserving the integrity of the Convention. \r\nNevertheless, we acknowledge the necessity of ensuring \r\nthat the Convention remains relevant and is able to \r\nmeet today’s challenges, as well as those of the future. \r\nThat can be achieved through the development of new \r\nimplementing agreements.\r\nConsequently, the EU and its member States \r\nare happy to acknowledge the progress achieved in \r\nthe first two sessions of the Preparatory Committee \r\nin preparing recommendations on an international, \r\nlegally binding instrument under the Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea on the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof marine biological diversity of areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction. That has enabled significant unpacking of \r\nthe issues at stake. We would like to thank the Chair \r\nof the process, Ambassador Eden Charles of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, for his sterling stewardship, as well as the \r\nother four facilitators of the various informal groups.\r\nThe importance of oceans and their resources in \r\nthe context of sustainable development was recognized \r\nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We \r\nsubscribe to the view that responsible decision-making \r\nat all levels aimed at conserving and sustainably using \r\nthe oceans, seas and marine resources is crucial for \r\nachieving sustainable development. Consequently, we \r\nlook forward to the conference that will be held next \r\nJune to support the implementation of Goal 14 on oceans, \r\nand we will participate actively in the work needed to \r\nprepare it. We consider that the proper implementation \r\nof that Goal is necessary in order to counter the \r\nmajor threats that the marine environment continues \r\nto face, including climate change, marine debris, \r\nincluding plastics and micro-plastics, invasive alien \r\nspecies, eutrophication and dead zones, anthropogenic \r\nunderwater noise, overfishing and illegal, unreported \r\nand unregulated fishing — all of which contribute to \r\nthe declining health of the marine environment and the \r\ncontinued loss of marine biodiversity.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nrecognize that climate change will have significant \r\nadverse impacts on oceans and their ecosystems, \r\nwhich will have social and economic consequences, \r\nparticularly for developing countries. As signatories to \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we reiterate \r\nthe call for parties to implement their obligations under \r\nthat Agreement and further call on those States that are \r\nnot yet party to the Agreement to become so, with a view \r\nto working together, in a coordinated manner, in order \r\nto tackle one of the major threats to oceans and life on \r\nEarth. Thus, we welcome that the eighteenth meeting, \r\nnext year, of the Informal Consultative Process will \r\ndeal with the effects of climate change on oceans.\r\nThe European Union and its member States also \r\ncontinue to be firmly committed to the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of \r\nthe Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic \r\nAspects. We consider that the coming second cycle \r\nshould enhance the scientific information available \r\nto managers and policymakers so as to improve the \r\nquality of decision-making. We would like to thank all \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 9/29\r\nthe scientists and other colleagues who have offered to \r\nwork voluntarily on that important process.\r\nLastly, on draft resolution A/71/L.26, entitled \r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”, the European Union \r\nand its member States regret that the oral statement \r\non the programme budget implication before us \r\nwas submitted so late in the process. That statement \r\nshould have been issued in a timely manner, so as to \r\nallow Member States to consider it thoroughly before \r\ntaking action. We would like to insist that agreement \r\non the draft resolution on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea is without prejudice to the discussion in the Fifth \r\nCommittee on the revised estimates presented to us.\r\nTurning now to draft resolution A/71/L.24 on \r\nsustainable fisheries, the European Union is a strong \r\nsupporter of the United Nations Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks, which sets out principles for the conservation \r\nand management of highly migratory and straddling fish \r\nstocks and elaborates on the Convention’s fundamental \r\nprinciple of cooperation in order to ensure conservation \r\nand promote the objective of the optimum utilization \r\nof fisheries resources — both within and beyond the \r\nexclusive economic zone. Consequently, we consider \r\nthat the resumed Review Conference, which took place \r\nin May, can be seen as an important tool to improve the \r\neffective implementation of that Agreement.\r\nWe would like to register our satisfaction that it \r\nwas possible to agree on recommendations covering \r\na number of important issues, such as f lag State \r\nresponsibility and due diligence, illegal, unreported \r\nand unregulated fishing, vessels without nationality, \r\nstrengthening the role and effectiveness of regional \r\nfisheries-management bodies, and working conditions \r\naboard fishing vessels. We thank Professor Fábio \r\nHazin of Brazil for his able chairing of the Conference. \r\nWe also welcome the entry into force of the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \r\nAgreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter \r\nand Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated \r\nFishing on 5 June, as we consider it to be an important \r\ntool for preventing, deterring and eliminating illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nThe European Union is also satisfied with the \r\noutcomes of the review of bottom-fishing measures, \r\nincluding the useful workshop that was held in the \r\ncontext of the draft resolution on sustainable fisheries. \r\nWe recognize that States, individually and through \r\nregional fisheries bodies, have undertaken necessary \r\nmeasures to implement the provisions of previous \r\nresolutions. However, we also note that implementation \r\nhas not been sufficient in all cases and areas. We \r\nbelieve that more and better science, as well as more \r\nstringent implementation of measures, is necessary, if \r\nvulnerable marine ecosystems — including deep-sea \r\nfish stocks — are to be protected from such bottom-\r\nfishing activities.\r\nLastly, the European Union and its member States \r\nwould like to express their gratitude to the Secretariat \r\nand to the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of \r\nthe Sea for their work and constant support throughout \r\nthe year.\r\nMr. Katota (Zambia): I am pleased to deliver a \r\nstatement on behalf of the 32 landlocked developing \r\ncountries (LLDCs) on agenda item 73 (a), entitled, \r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea”, with particular focus \r\non draft resolution A/71/L.26, which was coordinated \r\nby Mr. Ndembile of South Africa.\r\nOceans, coastal areas and seas are an essential \r\ncomponent of the Earth’s ecosystem and a primary \r\nprovider of economic and social services to humankind. \r\nTherefore, the importance of the sustained protection \r\nand conservation of the seas and oceans, including \r\ntheir resources, for the survival of humankind cannot \r\nbe overstated. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment recognizes the importance of those \r\nresources for the attainment of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) and, thus, emphasizes their \r\nconservation and their sustainable use.\r\nIt is in that regard that we welcome all initiatives \r\ntaken at all levels — including at the national, regional \r\nand international levels — to protect those resources in \r\norder to ensure their sustainability. As noted in draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.26, the early entry into force of the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change on 4 November \r\n2016 is a welcome development and its implementation \r\nis even more important for efforts to achieve \r\nsustainable development.\r\nThe United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea (UNCLOS) gives rights to landlocked States to \r\nutilize the oceans, seas and marine resources, and more \r\nthan half of the 32 landlocked developing countries \r\nare currently State parties to UNCLOS. According to \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n10/29 16-41791\r\narticle 69 of the Convention, landlocked States have \r\nthe right to participate, on an equitable basis, in the \r\nexploitation of an appropriate part of the surplus of the \r\nliving resources of the exclusive economic zones of \r\ncoastal States of the same subregion or region, taking \r\ninto account the relevant economic and geographical \r\ncircumstances of all the States concerned. In addition, \r\nlandlocked States also have a right to the high seas, \r\nto lay submarine cables and pipelines, to construct \r\nartificial islands and other installations permitted \r\nunder international law, to fish, to conduct scientific \r\nresearch and to navigate the high seas, as stated in \r\narticles 87 and 90 of UNCLOS. Landlocked States have \r\nthe right to sail ships f lying their f lag on the high seas, \r\nas indicated in articles 90 and 91.\r\nHowever, while LLDCs have those rights, their \r\nutilization of those provisions remains quite minimal. \r\nTheir limited participation is particularly due to \r\nfinancial and technical resource constraints, lack of \r\nawareness and ratification, limited technologies, as \r\nwell as limited access to the sea. Let me highlight some \r\nof the needs of those countries, which are also well \r\ncaptured in the draft resolution being adopted today.\r\nFirst of all, there is a need for capacity-building. \r\nThe landlocked developing countries require capacity-\r\nbuilding so as to be able to understand the rights and \r\nobligations in the Convention and to fully implement it, \r\nthereby enabling them to benefit from the sustainable \r\nuse of the oceans and seas, and to fully participate \r\nin the protection of the marine environment and its \r\nconservation. They need technical support so as to be \r\nable to participate fully in global and regional forums \r\non ocean affairs and the law of the sea. Secondly, the \r\ntransfer of technology is essential in particular to build \r\ncapacity in marine science research in order to enable \r\nthe LLDCs to participate. Thirdly, financial support \r\nis necessary to support the participation of LLDCs in \r\nactivities related to the implementation of UNCLOS.\r\nThe LLDCS therefore call on partner regional \r\nand international organizations to be cognizant of \r\nthe challenges faced by the LLDCs in implementing \r\nUNCLOS and other regional and international \r\nagreements related to the use and conservation of the \r\noceans and seas and in safeguarding their legitimate \r\nrights and interests, and to ensure balance in norm-\r\nsetting.\r\nWe welcome the call made in resolution A/71/L.26 \r\nfor the Secretary-General to convene the twenty-\r\nseventh Meeting of States Parties to the Convention in \r\nJune 2017. As I mentioned earlier, the participation of \r\nthe LLDCs is limited owing to the specific challenges \r\nthat they face. It is nevertheless important that the \r\nMeeting address the specific challenges of LLDCs \r\nand allocate time to discuss their issues and identify \r\nrecommendations on how to foster their participation \r\nin the utilization and protection of the oceans and \r\nseas in order for them to contribute to the successful \r\nimplementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14.\r\nMrs. Chigiyal (Micronesia): I have the honour to \r\ndeliver this statement on behalf of the States members \r\nof the Pacific Islands Forum. We would like to thank \r\nMr. Joyini of South Africa, Mr. Kravik of Norway and \r\nMrs. Deiye of Nauru for bringing negotiations on the \r\nrespective resolutions to their successful conclusion. \r\nWe look forward to their adoption.\r\nWe welcome the continued emphasis on the \r\nuniversal and unified character of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). UNCLOS \r\nremains of vital strategic importance as the basis for \r\nnational, regional and global action and cooperation in \r\nthe marine sector and it should continue to be reflected \r\nas such in the oceans omnibus resolution (A/71/L.26). \r\nIt connects to a number of important events that have \r\nhappened this year, and I would like to highlight them \r\nand their interlinkages.\r\nIn late March and early April, we had the first \r\nsession of the Preparatory Committee established \r\nby General Assembly resolution 69/292 for the \r\ndevelopment of an internationally legally binding \r\ninstrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity in areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction. It was followed by the \r\nsecond session during the summer. Our discussions \r\nwere productive and we made good progress thanks to \r\nthe skilful leadership of Ambassador Eden Charles of \r\nTrinidad and Tobago in steering our discussions.\r\nWe are, however, dismayed at the lack of progress \r\nachieved so far in the context of the oceans omnibus \r\nresolution, which would clearly have been an effectual \r\nstatement. As many of us have been racing to meet the \r\ndeadline to submit inputs by Monday, we will now need \r\nto study this wealth of information in order to prepare \r\nourselves for the next session of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee, which will start in March 2017. We \r\ncertainly hope to continue to make good progress as we \r\nare now at the halfway point in the preparatory process.\r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 11/29\r\nOn 2 May, the Pacific countries celebrated World \r\nTuna Day here at the United Nations. Tuna is an \r\nimportant part of our life in the Pacific. It provides \r\nemployment, food security and many other benefits. \r\nIn fact, many people in our region have a spiritual \r\nconnection to tuna. It is therefore only logical that \r\nthe United Nations would recognize the importance \r\nof the Day, and we are looking forward to adopting \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.27 later today. So far, over 90 \r\ncountries have sponsored the draft. We thank them for \r\ntheir support, and we invite everyone else that has not \r\nyet done so to join us.\r\nIn June, the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea \r\nexamined marine debris, plastics and microplastics. The \r\ndiscussion was both timely and comprehensive; it looked \r\nat the scale of the problem and also at a comprehensive \r\nset of solutions, from prevention to removal. We \r\nwelcome the report of the Chairs (A/71/204) on the \r\nwork of the Informal Consultative Process and its place \r\nwithin this year’s omnibus resolution. We also welcome \r\nthe renewal of its mandate and that it will focus on the \r\ninteraction of oceans and climate change next year.\r\nIn August, we stressed the importance of the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the second cycle of the \r\nRegular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment \r\nof the State of the Marine Environment, including \r\nSocioeconomic Aspects. It is essential that science \r\nunderpin policymaking on oceans and fisheries issues. \r\nThe process here at the United Nations for obtaining the \r\nbest available science is the development of the World \r\nOcean Assessment. We welcome the decisions taken on \r\nthe scope and duration of the second cycle.\r\nIn September, we finished the modalities for \r\nthe United Nations Conference to Support the \r\nImplementation of Sustainable Development Goal \r\n14, which will be co-hosted by Fiji and Sweden in \r\nNew York during the week of World Oceans Day next \r\nyear. We welcome the appointment of the Permanent \r\nRepresentatives of Portugal and Singapore to facilitate \r\nthe preparations, and we look forward to working closely \r\nwith them. The planned concise outcome document in \r\nthe form of a call for action will set the tone of our work, \r\nbut the real success of the Conference will depend on \r\nthe partnership dialogues. All stakeholders, States, \r\nintergovernmental organizations, the private sector \r\nand civil society are asked to contribute to this success \r\nand to further the agenda by committing themselves to \r\nfully implementing Goal 14.\r\nWe will all need to strengthen and accelerate the \r\nimplementation of the commitments we have already \r\nundertaken and put new ones on the table. Healthy, \r\nproductive and resilient oceans are the key to the future \r\nof our blue planet. Given the vastness of the Pacific \r\nOcean, we have always seen ourselves as custodians in \r\nprotecting and sustainably using our oceans.\r\nAt the forty-seventh Pacific Islands Forum held \r\nearlier this year in my country, our leaders adopted the \r\nPohnpei Ocean Statement: A Course to Sustainability. \r\nThe theme reinforces the inseparable link between our \r\noceans, seas and the Pacific Island peoples and their \r\nvalues, traditional practices and spiritual connections. \r\nIn this regard, the Pacific Islands Forum will continue \r\nto advocate for healthy, productive and resilient oceans \r\nhere at the United Nations. We see this as a contribution \r\nto our efforts to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment.\r\nIn closing, I want to thank all who have contributed \r\nto and supported these processes.\r\nMs. Wilson (Australia): It gives me great pleasure \r\nto reflect on what has been a very busy year for oceans \r\nand law of the sea. As we have just heard from the Chair \r\nof the Pacific Islands Forum, the range of key meetings \r\nand events that she outlined represents just a summary \r\nof what we have achieved over the year.\r\nCollectively, we made positive progress in \r\ndiscussions on a legally binding instrument on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction under the skilful guidance \r\nof Ambassador Eden Charles of Trinidad and Tobago, \r\nwhich has been acknowledged by others. The Informal \r\nConsultative Process discussed the extent of the \r\nchallenges posed by marine debris, plastics and \r\nmicroplastics, but also, what was more important, it \r\nexplored options for working together at all levels to \r\naddress these challenges.\r\nIn fisheries, we considered progress in the \r\nimplementation of the United Nations Fish Stocks \r\nAgreement through the Review Conference and \r\nimplementation of the General Assembly bottom-\r\nfishing measures, as set out in resolution 64/72 and \r\nresolution 66/68. The annual oceans omnibus draft \r\nresolution (A/71/L.26) and the sustainable fisheries \r\ndraft resolution (A/71/L.24) provided vehicles to reflect \r\non all these issues and on other developments in the law \r\nof the sea. We found the relevant discussions rich and \r\nproductive, chaired, respectively, by the very capable \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n12/29 16-41791\r\nMr. Thembile Joyini of South Africa and Mr. Andreas \r\nMotzfeldt Kravik of Norway.\r\nAustralia is pleased to co-sponsor both draft \r\nresolutions, given our particular interest as an island \r\nnation in the protection and sustainable use of the ocean \r\nand its resources. It welcomes the continued recognition \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS) as setting out the legal framework within \r\nwhich all activities in the oceans and seas must be \r\ncarried out. UNCLOS is of central strategic importance \r\nas the basis for national, regional and global action and \r\ncooperation in the marine sector. In turn, it underpins \r\ntrade between nations and supports economic growth. \r\nWith over 160 States parties, UNCLOS is one of the most \r\nwidely subscribed agreements in modern international \r\nlegal and diplomatic history. It is vital that the integrity \r\nof the Convention be preserved, and it is appropriate \r\nthat the oceans omnibus resolution should continue to \r\nreflect the universal and unified character of UNCLOS.\r\nSeparately, we thank States for supporting the text \r\nproposed by Australia on illicit wildlife trafficking \r\nin the context of the oceans omnibus resolution. This \r\ntext provides further recognition of the serious and \r\ngrowing problem of illicit wildlife trafficking, and of \r\nthe need for enhanced regional and global cooperation \r\nand coordination of the response. An effective response \r\nrequires coordinated international action, and we are \r\npleased that the oceans draft resolution highlights, \r\nin this regard, the relevance of the United Nations \r\nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime, \r\nthe United Nations Convention against Corruption and \r\nthe Convention on International Trade in Endangered \r\nSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora.\r\nWe are also pleased that this year’s ocean’s draft \r\nresolution includes a reference to the vital role played \r\nby coastal blue carbon ecosystems in climate adaptation \r\nand mitigation. Blue carbon ecosystems are some of the \r\nmost threatened in the world, and there is an urgent \r\nneed to work together to both protect and restore them. \r\nTo this end, Australia announced at the Paris Climate \r\nChange Conference in 2015 that we were establishing \r\nan International Partnership for Blue Carbon. In recent \r\nmonths, we have been delighted to welcome new \r\nmembers: France, the United States, the United Arab \r\nEmirates, Sierra Leone and the Nature Conservancy.\r\nAt the recent Climate Change Conference in \r\nMarrakech, Morocco, Australia announced, with \r\nFrance, a new plan of action for the International Coral \r\nReef Initiative (ICRI). Recognizing the impact of the \r\nrecent global bleaching event on the world’s coral \r\nreefs, including Australia’s own Great Barrier Reef, the \r\nplan gives ICRI an enhanced focus on climate change, \r\nincluding the role that coral reefs and related coastal \r\nblue carbon ecosystems can play in climate adaptation \r\nand mitigation.\r\nWe look forward to continuing to work together \r\nto ensure the health, sustainability and security of \r\nour oceans.\r\nMr. Zahir (Maldives): As a low-lying series of \r\natolls that are both reliant on the ocean and directly \r\nthreatened by changes to the marine environment, my \r\ncountry, the Maldives, views matters relating to the \r\noceans and seas as critically important. We therefore \r\ngreatly appreciate the attention and time being paid to \r\nthe significant challenges faced by the world’s oceans \r\nand seas and welcome the adoption of the annual \r\nresolutions under this agenda item. My delegation \r\nfurther welcomes the Secretary-General’s reports under \r\nthis item (A/71/74 and A/71/351), which serve as an \r\nimportant catalogue of the debate and negotiations on \r\nthis issue. We also recognize and thank the coordinators \r\nof draft resolution A/71/L.27 for their commitment in \r\nleading the informal discussions.\r\nThe ocean has sustained life on earth for billions of \r\nyears and serves to balance all the delicate ecosystems \r\non our planet. It is nature’s source of immeasurable \r\nwealth, which we as humans have only just begun to \r\nexplore. It is not only an asset, but a necessity to the \r\ncontinuation of life as we know it. This is precisely \r\nwhy we need to ensure that the oceans remain a source \r\nof life for future generations, instead of evolving \r\ninto a threat to their existence as a result of our own \r\nthoughtless actions.\r\nGiven the interconnected nature of our oceans, \r\nhuman actions that adversely impact the oceans \r\ndirectly or indirectly affect us all, including those of us \r\nwho do not cause or even contribute to these problems. \r\nSmall island States, the major part of whose geography \r\nconsists of ocean, are the most susceptible to falling \r\nvictim to these adverse impacts.\r\nAs one of the biggest threats facing our generation, \r\nthe wide-ranging and often irreversible impacts of \r\nclimate change, are not only altering our atmosphere, \r\nbut ravaging our oceans as well. With the aggregate \r\nincrease in ocean temperatures throughout the world, \r\nthermal stress caused by events such as El Niño has \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 13/29\r\namplified, causing severe coral bleaching across \r\nMaldivian reefs, compromising marine ecosystems \r\nand posing challenges to bait fisheries. Similarly, with \r\nthe increase in surface temperatures, the thermocline \r\nlayer has regressed, leading to the decline of surface \r\nskipjack tuna catches. Ocean acidification, also directly \r\nlinked with greenhouse-gas emissions, has chemically \r\nchanged marine environments, resulting in detrimental \r\nimpacts on the ecosystems, whose extent remains to \r\nbe discovered.\r\nThe increase in water temperatures, coral bleaching \r\nand ocean acidification and the deterioration of the \r\nmarine environment have impacted not only fisheries, \r\nbut tourism as well, with adverse consequences for the \r\ntwo largest economic industries in the Maldives. The \r\nworld at large needs to enhance efforts to mitigate \r\nthe adverse impacts of climate change and global \r\nwarming, in the interest of intragenerational and \r\nintergenerational equity.\r\nAnother significant cross-border issue plaguing \r\nour oceans is abandoned, lost or otherwise discarded \r\nfishing gear. It is estimated that there are over 640,000 \r\ntons of abandoned fishing gear throughout the world’s \r\noceans and that they will take hundreds of years to \r\ndisintegrate. During monsoon seasons, abandoned \r\nfish-aggregating devices and ghost nets drift into \r\nMaldivian waters, destroying reefs and entangling \r\ncetaceans and other marine life. This poses a risk not \r\nonly to the marine environment, but to humans as \r\nwell, owing to the introduction of microplastics into \r\nthe food chain. In addition to mitigating the risks to \r\nhuman and environmental health, there is also an \r\neconomic incentive for us to address this issue. A cost-\r\nbenefit analysis has demonstrated that the expense of \r\nretrieving such gear is minute compared with the loss \r\nof revenue incurred by failing to do so. We need to take \r\ncollective action to stop contributing to this problem, \r\nwhich impacts the world at large, and to start reversing \r\nthe damage that has been done already.\r\nOcean plastic pollution and marine littering as \r\na result of incompetent waste management create \r\nequally harmful risks for the global oceans and marine \r\nwildlife. On a global scale, we need to reduce both \r\nthe production and the consumption of plastic, and at \r\nthe same time, ensure that waste management plans \r\nare improved to intercept plastic waste and utilize \r\nthe potential economic benefits that are to be reaped \r\nfrom recycling. In this regard, we in the Maldives \r\nhave already begun to address ocean plastic pollution \r\nthrough a partnership between Parley for the Oceans \r\nand a local non-governmental organization (NGO), \r\nBiodiversity Education and Awareness Maldives.\r\nThe value and significance of the oceans is \r\nrecognized best by small island States, as our relationship \r\nwith the oceans transcends economic value. The strong \r\nsocial and cultural ties we have with the oceans form a \r\npart of our unique identity. Therefore, we Maldivians \r\nhave embraced our role as custodian of the oceans and \r\nhave undertaken numerous measures to conserve and \r\nsustainably use our oceans.\r\nIn line with target 14.5 of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal, on conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of oceans and seas, the Maldives has designated \r\n42 marine protected areas throughout its national \r\nwaters, totalling more than 24,494 hectares of reef \r\narea. Furthermore, the Environmental Protection \r\nAgency has identified 274 environmentally sensitive \r\nareas based on their biodiversity, uniqueness and the \r\neconomic benefits of preservation. However, to attain \r\nthe goal of conserving 10 per cent of coastal and marine \r\nareas by 2020, we call upon other countries to enhance \r\nconservation efforts in their jurisdictions as well. \r\nThe UNESCO biosphere reserve in Baa Atoll in the \r\nMaldives is an illustration of how the economic benefits \r\nof marine protected areas outweigh the restrictions in \r\ndevelopment activities.\r\nSimilarly, with regard to protecting the unique \r\nbiodiversity contained within coral reef ecosystems, \r\nthe Maldives has undertaken extensive efforts \r\nto restore coral reefs through coral propagation. \r\nThis methodology is being successfully utilized \r\nby tourist resorts and NGOs. Additionally, a coral \r\nreef monitoring framework, involving civilians and \r\nscientific researchers, has been established to support \r\nthe national coral reef monitoring programme and to \r\nkeep closer track of what is happening in our reefs. Not \r\nonly do coral reefs present diverse ecological value, but \r\nour main industries — tourism and fisheries — rely \r\non them.\r\nThe Maldives is recognized as a global leader in \r\nsustainable fisheries. It utilizes sustainable fishing \r\nmethods, such as the pole and line fishing and \r\nhandline fishing, and educates the industry through the \r\ndevelopment of a fisheries’ curriculum, and reducing \r\nthe exploitation of live bait species through a live \r\nbait fishery management plan. We have established a \r\nfisheries information system, which ensures traceability \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n14/29 16-41791\r\nthroughout the value chain and is among one of the \r\nbest traceability systems in the world. Strong policies \r\nhave also been developed to introduce mariculture in \r\nthe Maldives with the goal of diversifying the fisheries \r\nsector and reducing stress on existing fish stocks.\r\nHowever, because we lack the capacity and \r\nresources to monitor our territorial waters adequately, \r\nthe Maldives continues to fall victim to illegal fishing \r\nthroughout our exclusive economic zone. This has \r\nresulted in economic losses greater than $600 million \r\nand is a major setback in our efforts to protect fish stocks \r\nand marine environments. It is becoming abundantly \r\nclear that we, as small island States, with our inherent \r\nconstraints in capacity and resources, cannot bear the \r\nburden of protecting the oceans alone. As the ocean is \r\na resource that connects us all, this is a global issue \r\nfor which the responsibility should be shared by the \r\nworld. We all need to become the guardians of our \r\nEarth’s oceans.\r\nIn this regard, the Maldives welcomes the United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14, on conservation and \r\nsustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources, \r\nwhich will be convened in New York next year. We \r\nbelieve it will be a useful platform, which will bring \r\nall countries together to discuss how to implement the \r\nGoal, build partnerships and share mutually beneficial \r\nexperiences and best practices. We hope that it will \r\ndeliver a strong call for action as an outcome.\r\nWhile we at the United Nations are engaged on \r\nmany oceans issues, including such varied processes as \r\ngovernance, fisheries and the conservation of species, \r\nwe need to rethink our systems of engagement. The \r\noceans and their resources form an interconnected \r\nsystem, and our approaches towards their preservation \r\nmust reflect that reality. We need to stop working \r\nin silos and urgently adopt a more coordinated and \r\ncomprehensive response.\r\nThe establishment of a Preparatory Committee \r\non an international legally binding instrument on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction presents \r\nus with a unique opportunity to address gaps in \r\nocean governance and protection. We must utilize \r\nthis opportunity and work together constructively. \r\nIndeed, the process of establishing such an instrument \r\non biological diversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction may, over the years to come, lead to one \r\nof the most important legal regimes in this context. It \r\nis our sincere hope that it will result globally in the \r\nlarge-scale change that is required to give our oceans a \r\nfighting chance.\r\nWe need to stop poisoning the waters on which \r\nwe rely on for food. We need to stop exploiting the \r\nocean’s resources without regard for the long-term \r\nconsequences, especially when it is being done illegally. \r\nWe need to stop wiping out entire species which have \r\nthrived for millions of years. We need to stop polluting \r\nthe Earth’s atmosphere in a way that could change the \r\nnature of the ocean and we need to preserve the wealth \r\nof our oceans for our future generations.\r\nMs. Picco (Monaco) (spoke in French): Healthy \r\nand productive oceans for our present and future are \r\nindispensable for the achievement of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Sustainable Development Goal \r\n14 — to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and \r\nmarine resources for sustainable development — further \r\nstrengthens the responsibility of the General Assembly \r\nto ensure the effective implementation of commitments \r\nmade for oceans and law of the sea.\r\nThe United Nations Conference to Support the \r\nImplementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, to \r\nbe held next June, provides us an opportunity to address \r\nthe challenges facing the world’s oceans. Monaco, which \r\nsupported the initiative of Fiji and Sweden, intends to \r\nsubstantially contribute to preparations therefor and to \r\nthe Conference itself, in particular by sharing expertise \r\non issues relating to ocean acidification, which is a \r\nconsequence of climate change and affects marine life.\r\nOcean acidification is indeed a phenomenon that \r\nundermines the health of our oceans and especially \r\naffects coastal areas. Since 2010, the Scientific Centre \r\nof Monaco and the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency’s Environment Laboratories, which are based \r\nin Monaco, have organized with several partners, three \r\nworkshops focusing on the socioeconomic impacts \r\nof ocean acidification. These impacts are especially \r\nsignificant on fishing, aquaculture, tourism, the \r\nculture and adaptation to climate change of coastal \r\ncommunities. The fourth workshop will be held in the \r\nPrincipality of Monaco from 15 to 17 October 2017.\r\nHis Serene Highness Prince Albert II is a dedicated \r\nadvocate for the oceans and their resources. He has \r\nbeen unrelenting in his personal commitment to \r\nensuring that the oceans find their rightful place in \r\nthe climate negotiations, as, until now, the oceans have \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 15/29\r\noccupied a relatively marginal place in international \r\nclimate negotiations, which have focused on land-based \r\ncarbon dioxide emissions by man, on the role of carbon \r\ndioxide capture by forests and the adaptation measures \r\nthat are necessary for climate change. This changed \r\nwith the launch of the Ocean and Climate Platform of \r\nUNESCO’s International Oceanographic Commission \r\nin 2015. The Platform has contributed to the integration \r\nof the major role of oceans in the climate regulation \r\nwithin the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.\r\nThe role of oceans in climate regulation also \r\nmotivated Monaco to join the High Ambition Coalition. \r\nThe Coalition enables our efforts to be further mobilized, \r\nnot just during the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, but also within all the relevant frameworks, \r\nas was recently seen successfully at the International \r\nMaritime Organization and the International Civil \r\nAviation Organization.\r\nI would also like to point out that Monaco is \r\ncurrently hosting a scoping meeting for the special \r\nreport on climate change and oceans and the cryosphere \r\nof the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \r\nwhich brings together 103 experts from 40 countries. \r\nThe drafting of this special report, which Monaco was \r\nhighly involved in, is a critical stage in the consideration \r\nof the oceans in the face of climate change. This report \r\nis expected to be completed by 2019.\r\nPlastic waste in our oceans is another significant \r\nproblem whose magnitude demands that action be taken \r\nurgently. It is terrifying to imagine the consequences \r\nof oceans harbouring more tons of plastic waste than \r\nfisheries resources. This looming disaster prompted \r\nPrince Albert II to sign the statement of intent to launch \r\nthe international coalition to reduce plastic wastes in \r\nthe sea during the United Nations Climate Conference \r\nheld in Marrakech, Morocco. The quantity of plastic \r\nwaste in the Mediterranean, which is, unfortunately, \r\none of the most polluted bodies of water, is estimated at \r\n$250 billion. To contribute to this awareness-raising, at \r\nthe beginning of the year, Morocco banned single-use \r\nplastic bags. By 2020 disposable plastic utensils will \r\nalso be banned.\r\nMr. Doualeh (Djibouti), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAs was announced during the Our Ocean \r\nconference, held in Washington, D.C., in September, \r\nMonaco will provide a financial contribution over \r\nthree years to microinitiatives aimed at reducing plastic \r\nwaste in the Mediterranean. However, our efforts \r\nwill be in vain without the support of the industrial \r\nsector. Consumers have a decisive role to play, the \r\nchoice being either to reduce dependence on plastic, \r\nwhich is becoming ever thinner and more resistant, \r\nor to consume fish with plastic. We work closely in \r\nthis area with numerous international institutions and \r\nnon-governmental institutions. Earlier this year, Prince \r\nAlbert II led a delegation to the World Congress of the \r\nInternational Union of the Conservation of Nature, \r\nwhere over 100 motions were adopted, including on \r\nmarine protected areas, biodiversity, management of \r\noceans and ecotourism.\r\nThis year, the Preparatory Committee established \r\nto develop a legally binding instrument on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction began \r\nits work. Jointly with Costa Rica, Monaco submitted \r\na written contribution, prior to the second session, on \r\nthe process of establishing area-based management \r\ntools, including marine protected areas. We firmly \r\nbelieve that marine protected areas are a lasting, \r\nviable, ecologically responsible and financially tailored \r\nsolution to conserve fragile marine environments and \r\nto achieve our conservation goals.\r\nWithin the Mediterranean framework, beginning \r\nin 2013, Monaco committed, together with France and \r\nTunisia, to an initiative which is aimed at supporting \r\nthe establishment and management of marine protected \r\nareas by establishing an innovative trust fund. Morocco \r\nand Albania have since joined us, and the Union for the \r\nMediterranean has extended its political support. The \r\ntrust fund is sustained by contributions from public \r\nand private donors, including international donors, and \r\nby foundations, businesses and sponsors. The aim is to \r\nextend long-term support and additional funding for \r\nspecific projects. This year the Principality provided \r\n€500,000.\r\nThat initiative reflects the commitments under \r\nthe Barcelona Convention for the Protection of the \r\nMarine Environment and the Coastal Region of the \r\nMediterranean and the Aichi goal No. 11. Initiatives \r\nlaunched by this trust fund should allow the \r\nestablishment of a network of marine protected areas \r\nthat are ecologically representative and effectively \r\nmanaged. To do so, the funds will be leveraged to \r\nimprove already existing marine protected areas and to \r\nfoster the creation of new ones. The provision of seed \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n16/29 16-41791\r\ncapital to Morocco and Tunisia was announced during \r\nthe Second Forum of Marine Protected Areas in the \r\nMediterranean, which was recently held in Tangier.\r\nMonaco is the headquarters of the Agreement \r\non the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, \r\nMediterranean Sea and Neighbouring Atlantic Area, \r\nan international organization that recently marked its \r\ntwentieth anniversary. The Agreement recently signed \r\na memorandum of cooperation with the United Nations \r\nEnvironmental Programme, the aim of which is to \r\nestablish a regular dialogue with the secretariat of the \r\nConvention for Protection of the Mediterranean Sea \r\nagainst Pollution. Political cooperation and contacts \r\nwith fisheries and human activities which generate \r\nthreats to cetaceans will also be strengthened. The \r\nAgreement is also confirmed in its pilot role under \r\nthe ecosystem-based approach within the Barcelona \r\nConvention as regards cetacean populations and noise \r\npollution, which have become major concerns for the \r\nconservation of living marine resources.\r\nWe are also host to the International Hydrographic \r\nOrganization (IHO), which was set up in 1921 in \r\nMonaco. As such, I would like to draw the attention \r\nof the General Assembly to the priorities of that \r\ninternational organization. Unfortunately, it remains \r\nlargely unknown to the wider public. Since 2001, IHO \r\nhas enjoyed observer status in the General Assembly. \r\nThe promotion of safe navigation and the protection \r\nof the marine environment are two priorities for IHO, \r\nand its representatives regular participate in meetings \r\nin New York. The benefits of hydrography, bathymetry \r\nand seabed mapping are critical for trade and tourism, \r\nbut this has not been sufficiently underscored. \r\nImagine, 85 per cent of the seabed has not yet been \r\ndirectly measured. That means that the surface of the \r\nplanet Mars has been mapped to a greater extent than \r\nour oceans.\r\nTherefore, our delegation has plans to improve the \r\ndrafting of the appropriate paragraphs in the omnibus \r\nresolution on the oceans and law of the sea at the next \r\nsession. As the 2005 Protocol that aims to strengthen \r\nthe IHO Convention entered into force on 8 November, \r\nany State requesting to join IHO will no longer have \r\nto secure the approval of two thirds of the existing \r\nmembers and, if in practice no State’s request is denied, \r\nthat means that the time required for accession to \r\nmembership will be reduced. Until now, it has taken \r\ntwo to three years.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to warmly thank the \r\nfacilitators of the two draft resolutions under discussion, \r\nwhich we are co-sponsoring. I would also like to thank \r\nthe States which submitted draft resolution A/71/L.27, \r\non World Tuna Day, which we are also co-sponsoring. \r\nThe small island developing States, with which we work \r\nclosely, invite Member States to respect a fair balance \r\nbetween conservation and sustainable use of our very \r\nvaluable marine resources.\r\nMr. Meza-Cuadra (Peru) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nMy delegation would like to begin this statement \r\nby welcoming the various reports of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral both on the oceans and the law of the sea and \r\non sustainable fisheries.\r\nToday, as the General Assembly considers the \r\ndraft resolutions relating to oceans and the law of the \r\nsea, Peru reaffirms its historic commitment to the \r\nprotection of the oceans and the conservation of fishery \r\nresources and other marine living resources. Peru is an \r\nextremely diverse country, and we recognize the great \r\npotential that this has for its sustainable development, \r\nfor the maintenance of our ecosystems and for the well-\r\nbeing of our population, as can be seen in the high \r\npriority that my country attaches to the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in \r\nparticular Goal 14, “Conserve and sustainably use the \r\noceans, seas and marine resources”.\r\nMy country welcomes the current preparatory \r\nprocess for the United Nations Conferences to Support \r\nthe Implementation of Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 14, and we reiterate our full support for all the \r\nGeneral Assembly processes relating to oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea. We also express our recognition for \r\nthe priority given to this issue by the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIn that regard, my delegation had the honour \r\nto co-chair the seventeenth meeting of the United \r\nNations Open-ended Informal Consultative Process \r\non Oceans and the Law of the Sea, at which the areas \r\nof concentration were marine debris, plastics and \r\nmicroplastics. On that occasion, we were able to see that, \r\nin order to solve this problem, we need a comprehensive \r\nmultisectoral approach that does not just include the \r\nparticipation of Governments at various levels, but also \r\nthat of international organizations, civil society and \r\nindustry. Peru is pleased to see that draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.26, ”Oceans and the law of the sea”, decides \r\nthat the Informal Consultative Process will focus its \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 17/29\r\ndiscussions at its eighteenth meeting on the theme “The \r\neffects of climate change on oceans”. We believe that, \r\nwith the recent entry into force of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, which Peru has signed and ratified, \r\nit is vital that the General Assembly address that issue.\r\nPeruvian waters are some of the most productive on \r\nthe planet, providing 20 per cent of pelagic production \r\nworldwide, and in that way we contribute to global food \r\nsecurity. We recognize, however, the fragile nature \r\nof the oceans and the various factors which threaten \r\nthem. That is why Peru was one of the first countries \r\nto declare the need to protect fishery resources and \r\nother marine living resources. In that regard, my \r\ndelegation, together with others, actively promotes in \r\nvarious forums the establishment of rules to eliminate \r\nfisheries subsidies, which contribute to overfishing \r\nand overexploitation. They have negative effects on the \r\nsustainability of marine resources, trade, food security \r\nand in general on sustainable development. At the same \r\ntime, the stated objective is consistent with target 14.6 \r\nof the 2030 Agenda.\r\nIn view of the former, my delegation wishes \r\nto conclude this statement by reiterating its strong \r\ncommitment to all General Assembly processes that \r\nrelate to oceans and the law of the sea, in conformity \r\nwith our historic concern about the protection of the \r\noceans and our position as a biologically extremely \r\ndiverse country that recognizes the great potential \r\nthat such diversity represents for future generations. \r\nIn that regard, we express our support for the draft \r\nresolutions on oceans and the law of the sea (A/71/L.26) \r\nand on sustainable fisheries (A/71/L.24), and we \r\nare co-sponsoring draft resolution A/71/L.27, which \r\ndesignates World Tuna Day.\r\nMr. Rattray (Jamaica): My delegation welcomes \r\nthe opportunity to participate in the debate on agenda \r\nitem 73, “Oceans and the law of the sea”, including \r\nsub-item (b) on sustainable fisheries. We thank the \r\nSecretary-General for his annual comprehensive report \r\n(A/71/74) on developments and issues related to ocean \r\naffairs and the law of the sea.\r\nAs an island State, our fortunes and existence \r\nare inextricably tied to the oceans, and we therefore \r\nvalue and hold dear efforts aimed at their preservation \r\nand protection. For that reason, we had hoped to see \r\neven stronger language in the draft resolution on the \r\noceans and the law of the sea (A/71/L,26), in keeping \r\nwith the collective commitment to which we are all \r\nheld accountable. It is our view that the adoption of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development provides an \r\nessential framework for us to advance our work in that \r\nregard. Through a dedicated focus on Goal 14 and its \r\ncorresponding targets, we are provided an opportunity \r\nto ensure effective management and conservation of \r\nour maritime resources for sustainable development.\r\nJamaica is pleased to note the steady progress that \r\nis being made in various forums devoted to oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea. We applaud the many efforts that have \r\nbeen made at the bilateral, regional and multilateral \r\nlevels with the convening of numerous workshops and \r\nmeetings, and other initiatives, all of which have the \r\ncommon objective of ensuring that we remain faithful \r\nto our obligations in this critical field.\r\nAs host of the International Seabed Authority, we \r\nare committed to the work that is being undertaken to \r\nsecure the resources in the Area for the benefit of all, \r\nas well as to preserve and protect the environmental \r\nintegrity of the deep seabed. We take this opportunity \r\nto reiterate our congratulations to Mr. Michael \r\nLodge on his election as the Secretary-General of the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority, during the twenty-\r\nsecond session of the Authority, held earlier this year.\r\nJamaica has consistently underscored the need for \r\ncooperation and collaboration to ensure that developing \r\ncountries, such as ours, are able to claim their share of \r\nthe global commons. That is a fundamental principle \r\nenshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea (UNCLOS). The inviolable and non-derogable \r\nnature of this principle is a fundamental underpinning \r\nof our continuing discourse on oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea.\r\nOur long association with this process, dating back \r\nto the adoption of UNCLOS, continues to inspire our \r\nbelief that there is tremendous scope for even greater \r\ncooperation on issues relating to our seas and oceans. \r\nFor that reason, we are heartened by the very positive \r\nand congenial atmosphere that characterizes our \r\ndiscussions on biodiversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction. We remain convinced that the successful \r\nconclusion of a new instrument on the protection and \r\nconservation of the marine resources in areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction is a necessary and important \r\ncomplement to ensure effective ocean governance.\r\nGiven the significant technological and scientific \r\nadvances that have been made since the adoption \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n18/29 16-41791\r\nof UNCLOS, it is imperative that we examine and \r\nestablish the requisite framework to effectively govern \r\nthe management and sustainable use of our marine \r\nresources. Moreover, we believe that this should \r\nbe done in a fair and equitable manner. We regard \r\nthe International Seabed Authority as an essential \r\ninstitution that should feature in any regime going \r\nforward. What the discussion on biodiversity beyond \r\nareas of national jurisdiction strives to accomplish \r\nis best addressed within the context of what the \r\nAuthority currently provides. Its work to date, as well \r\nas its strategic value as an organization that brings \r\ntogether so many member States, makes the Authority \r\nthe most suitable institution to ensure that the new \r\ninstrument for the biodiversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction is provided with the structure required for \r\neffective implementation. For my delegation, therefore, \r\nit is of vital importance that we make use of existing \r\nmechanisms as opposed to creating new ones.\r\nThe participation of developing countries in \r\nthe deliberations on oceans and the law of the sea is \r\ncentral to any meaningful consideration of the issue. \r\nWhile we all have a vested interest and stake in this \r\nimportant matter, many of our countries are heavily \r\ndependent on the oceans and their resources for their \r\nvery survival. Much of our way of life in Jamaica, \r\nincluding our food and nutrition, the tourism industry \r\nand our recreational activities, hinge on ensuring that \r\nour maritime space is adequately protected and its \r\nresources are sustainably used. It is worth noting that \r\nfish is the second most important protein in our diet, \r\nnext only to poultry. In addition, the contribution of \r\ntourism to Jamaica’s economy represents 30 per cent of \r\nour gross domestic product.\r\nConsequently, threats to our marine environment, \r\nwhich include overfishing, pollution and the impact of \r\nclimate change, represent a real danger to our economic \r\nviability. According to the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations 2016 report, \r\nThe State of the World’s Fisheries and Aquaculture, \r\nglobal total capture fishery production in 2014 was \r\n93.4 million tonnes, of which 81.5 million tonnes were \r\nfrom marine waters. The report notes that the world’s \r\nmarine fish stocks have not improved overall, despite \r\nnotable progress in some areas, and that biologically \r\nsustainable levels of fish stocks have decreased from \r\n90 per cent in 1974 to 68.6 per cent in 2013.\r\nWe wish to place on record our deep appreciation \r\nfor the invaluable work done by the Division for Ocean \r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea, the tireless efforts and \r\nunswerving commitment of which has been central \r\nto our achievements to date. The Division merits \r\nour continued support and requires commensurate \r\nresources to enable it to continue to function effectively.\r\nThe need for resources is also critical in the case of \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. \r\nMy delegation is concerned that the lack of adequate \r\nresources has limited the participation of members \r\nfrom developing countries who were elected to serve \r\non that body. Without broad-based representation, can \r\nwe truly say that the Commission has indeed fulfilled \r\nits mandate? We therefore urge countries that are in \r\na position to do so, to make the necessary resources \r\navailable to the Commission. We welcome the support \r\nthat has been provided by donor countries to the \r\nvoluntary trust fund established for the purpose of \r\nfacilitating the participation of experts from developing \r\ncountries. However, as overall funding levels are still \r\nfar from satisfactory, we encourage others to consider \r\nmaking contributions in that regard.\r\nIn many respects, oceans remain largely uncharted, \r\nwith vast numbers of species yet to be discovered. We \r\ntherefore have an obligation to ensure that our focus is \r\nnot just on how we can increase our knowledge about \r\nwhat lies beneath the surface of the sea, but also about \r\nhow to increase our resolve to conserve and sustainably \r\nuse those resources. For my delegation, therefore, the \r\nhigh-level United Nations Conference to Support the \r\nImplementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14, to \r\nbe held in June 2017, assumes even greater significance, \r\nas it will afford us the opportunity to collectively and \r\nunreservedly address issues critical to the protection of \r\nour oceans.\r\nWe are at a vital point in our efforts to conserve and \r\npreserve our oceans and seas but can do so only if we \r\nremain steadfast in our commitment to work together \r\nand support one another. We must not resile from that \r\nresponsibility but confront it with the seriousness and \r\nurgency that it requires. Rest assured that Jamaica \r\nstands ready to play its part in that regard.\r\nMr. Gafoor (Singapore): Singapore regards the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS) as one of the most important international \r\nconventions in existence. It provides the overarching \r\nframework for governance of the world’s oceans. \r\nAmbassador Tommy Koh of Singapore, who was the \r\nPresident of the third United Nations Conference on the \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 19/29\r\nLaw of the Sea, from 1980 to 1982, rightly described \r\nthe Convention as a constitution for the oceans. Over \r\nthe past two decades, UNCLOS has provided the legal \r\nframework for all activities in the oceans and seas, \r\nincluding international cooperation. In that regard, \r\nwe welcome Azerbaijan’s accession to UNCLOS. We \r\nurge those countries that have yet become parties to \r\nUNCLOS to do so as soon as possible.\r\nThe omnibus draft resolution (A/71/L.26) before \r\nus addresses a wide spectrum of activities that are \r\ncarried out in the oceans and seas and impact the entire \r\ninternational community. The various initiatives and \r\nmeetings relating to the Oceans and the Law of the Sea \r\nmade for a full agenda for this calendar year. Those \r\nmeetings were held independently of each other, but \r\nit is critical to underline the interlinkages between \r\nthem. In our view, it is important to achieve and sustain \r\ncoherence within and across the different processes, \r\nincluding by recognizing the place of UNCLOS at \r\ntheir core. In that regard, my delegation wishes to \r\nmake a few comments on biological diversity beyond \r\nareas of national jurisdiction; the International Seabed \r\nAuthority (ISA); the United Nations Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process; and the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting.\r\nWith regard to biodiversity beyond areas of \r\nnational jurisdiction, the Preparatory Committee \r\nhad two fruitful sessions, in which my delegation \r\nactively participated. We welcome the opportunity for \r\nMrs. Rena Lee, a member of the Singapore delegation, \r\nto contribute as the facilitator for the informal working \r\ngroup on capacity-building and the transfer of marine \r\ntechnology. UNCLOS enshrines a delicate balance of \r\ninterests. The discussions on biodiversity beyond areas \r\nof national jurisdiction need to recognize and respect \r\nthat balance. We trust that the constructive attitudes of \r\ndelegations will continue. Singapore will continue to \r\nmove forward and work closely with other parties to \r\nensure that we can collectively make progress on the \r\nbasis of consensus.\r\nWith regard to the ISA, Singapore has continued \r\nto participate actively in the work of the International \r\nSeabed Authority, including as a member of the ISA \r\nCouncil. Mrs. Rena Lee of Singapore was elected this \r\nyear to serve on the Legal and Technical Commission \r\nof the ISA for the period 2017-2020. That is a great \r\nhonour for Singapore. It underscores our commitment \r\nto contribute constructively to the work of the ISA \r\nin safeguarding the common heritage of humankind. \r\nWe also welcome the continued progress of the ISA \r\nin establishing rules, regulations and procedures for \r\nactivities in the Area under Part XI of UNCLOS.\r\nSingapore welcomes the submission of the initial \r\nworking draft of the regulations for exploitation at the \r\ntwenty-second session of the ISA. We have submitted \r\nour comments on the draft. The completion of that \r\nwork is a matter of priority. We also note the progress \r\nbeing made on the general and systematic review of the \r\nmanner in which the international regime of the Area \r\nhas operated. We look forward to the submission of the \r\nfinal report on the review by 15 April 2017. We thank \r\nISA Secretary-General Nii Odunton for his leadership \r\nover the years, and we look forward to working with the \r\nincoming Secretary-General, Mr. Michael Lodge.\r\nMy delegation also participated in the seventeenth \r\nmeeting of the United Nations Open-ended Informal \r\nConsultative Process on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, \r\nestablished by the General Assembly, which addressed \r\nthe topic of marine debris, plastics and microplastics. We \r\nwelcome the opportunity to reflect on the science and \r\nthe challenge posed by microplastics, the importance \r\nof prioritizing prevention, and the importance of an \r\nintegrated approach to the management of activities, \r\nincluding coordinated action among various competent \r\nsectoral authorities. Next year, the Informal Consultative \r\nProcess will focus on another pertinent topic: the effects \r\nof climate change on oceans. Singapore ratified the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change three months ago. \r\nWe welcomed its entry into force on 4 November this \r\nyear. Climate change continues to pose a significant \r\nrisk to many countries, especially to small island \r\ndeveloping States like Singapore. We look forward to \r\nthe exchange of views that will take place at next year’s \r\nInformal Consultative Process.\r\nWith regard to the Regular Process, Singapore \r\nbelieves that its work on issues pertaining to oceans \r\nmust continue to be informed by research into and \r\ninformation on the oceans and related human activities. \r\nUNCLOS establishes the legal framework within which \r\nall activities in the oceans and seas must be carried out. \r\nHowever, stakeholders often have a limited view of the \r\nocean that is focused on their own sectoral interests. \r\nWe therefore appreciate the Regular Process for Global \r\nReporting and Assessment of the State of the Marine \r\nEnvironment, including Socioeconomic Aspects. It has \r\nan important role to play in aiding our understanding \r\nof the marine environment, including its economic and \r\nsocial aspects. The first cycle of the Regular Process \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n20/29 16-41791\r\nhas been successfully completed. The first cycle \r\nresulted in the ground-breaking First Global Integrated \r\nMarine Assessment. The Assessment gave us very \r\nvaluable insights. We must now build upon them for the \r\nsecond cycle of the Regular Process from 2016 to 2020 \r\nand keep the momentum going.\r\nAnother area in which we will need to keep \r\nthe momentum going is with regard to Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal (SDG) 14 on the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of the oceans, seas and marine resources \r\nfor sustainable development. In that regard, I wish to \r\ncommend the President for his personal commitment \r\nand his leadership in supporting the United Nations \r\nConference on Oceans and Seas to Support the \r\nImplementation of Sustainable Development Goal 14. \r\nWe in Singapore share and support his vision that the \r\nConference will serve as a platform for all stakeholders \r\nto come together and galvanize the international \r\ncommunity into action to support the implementation \r\nof SDG 14. The outcome document, the partnership \r\ndialogues and the voluntary commitments to be \r\nannounced at the Conference in June 2017 will make \r\nan important contribution to the implementation of \r\nSDG 14. Singapore attaches the greatest importance to \r\nthe Conference. We regard it as an important priority \r\nnot only for Singapore but for the entire international \r\ncommunity. We look forward to actively participating in \r\nthe Conference and to working with the two co-Chairs, \r\nFiji and Sweden, as well as to working closely with all \r\nmembers of the international community to achieve a \r\nsuccessful outcome.\r\nMy delegation would like to take this opportunity \r\nto thank the Secretary-General for his comprehensive \r\nreport (A/71/74) on this agenda item. We also thank \r\nMr. Thembile Joyini of South Africa and Mr. Andreas \r\nKravik of Norway for their work in coordinating the \r\ninformal consultations on the omnibus draft resolution \r\n(A/71/L.26) and the draft resolution on sustainable \r\nfisheries (A/71/L.24), respectively. We would also like \r\nto express our thanks to the Director and staff of the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for \r\ntheir invaluable support to Member States during the \r\ninformal consultations.\r\nMr. Dinger (United States of America): My \r\ndelegation is pleased to co-sponsor draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.26 and A/71/L.24, entitled, respectively, \r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea” and “Sustainable \r\nfisheries, including through the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks, and related instruments”.\r\nAs many of those present know, Secretary of State \r\nJohn Kerry is a passionate advocate for the ocean \r\nbecause he recognizes that life on the planet depends on \r\na healthy ocean. The ocean provides food and income \r\nfor billions of people. It regulates our weather and \r\nclimate. It generates over half the oxygen we breathe \r\nand it absorbs much of our excess carbon dioxide, \r\nhelping to slow down the impacts of climate change.\r\nBut the ocean is in trouble. Over 30 per cent of \r\nthe world’s assessed fish stocks are overfished, and \r\nalmost 60 per cent more are already being harvested \r\nat the maximum sustainable level. We add millions of \r\ntons of plastic into the ocean every year. The acidity of \r\nmarine waters has risen 30 per cent since the industrial \r\nrevolution, weakening the shells of some sea creatures, \r\nand the ocean has absorbed over 90 per cent of the \r\nEarth’s additional heat since the 1970s, driving up \r\nocean temperature and sea levels.\r\nSecretary Kerry hosted the third Our Ocean \r\nconference in Washington, D.C., last September to \r\nfocus the world’s attention, once again, on the key ocean \r\nissues of our time — sustainable fisheries, marine \r\npollution, climate-related impacts on the ocean and \r\nmarine-protected areas — building on the commitments \r\nof the first Our Ocean conference in Washington in \r\n2014 and the second in Valparaiso, Chile, in October \r\n2015. Participants at the third Our Ocean conference \r\nannounced new commitments to protecting the ocean, \r\nvalued at over $5.2 billion, and pledging to safeguard \r\nalmost 4 million square kilometres of the ocean.\r\nTo date, participants from the three Our Ocean \r\nconferences have committed $9.2 billion in initiatives \r\nto protect the ocean and pledged to safeguard nearly \r\n9.9 million square kilometres of ocean. By adding the \r\nnew Ross Sea region marine-protected area, the total \r\nprotected area now comprises some 11.5 million square \r\nkilometres, an area roughly equal to the size of the \r\ncontinent of Africa or about 20 per cent of the Earth’s \r\nland area.\r\nWe look forward to building on those successes at \r\nthe next Our Ocean conference in Malta, in October \r\n2017, to be hosted by the European Union, as well as \r\nthe conferences to be hosted by Indonesia in 2018 and \r\nNorway in 2019. We are also pleased that the 2017 \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 21/29\r\nmeeting of the Open-ended Informal Consultative \r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea will address \r\nthe effects of climate change on oceans.\r\nThe ocean and our climate are inextricably linked. \r\nThe ocean absorbs much of our excess carbon dioxide \r\nand heat, but the damage caused by this phenomenon \r\nis already undermining marine ecosystems and coastal \r\ncommunities. Without additional action to limit \r\nemissions of greenhouse gases and rising temperatures, \r\nseas could rise up to 2 to 3 feet by the end of the century. \r\nEven modest temperature rises could affect more than \r\none billion people living in areas exposed to regular \r\ncoastal f looding and lead to more intense coastal \r\nstorms. Many fish species are moving toward the poles \r\nin search of cooler waters, putting fishing economies \r\nat risk and endangering the more than 3 billion people \r\naround the world who rely on seafood for protein. \r\nOur coral reefs are showing signs of devastation as \r\ncoral previously thought to be pristine and thriving is \r\nbleaching and dying.\r\nThat is why the ambitious goals and actions that \r\ncountries agreed to in Paris last year are imperative \r\nand provide us with a hopeful path forward. Next year’s \r\nInformal Consultative Process meeting will give us \r\nan opportunity to examine and raise awareness about \r\nthe impacts of climate change on the ocean, marine \r\necosystems and coastal communities, and strengthen \r\nour resolve to fully implement the Paris Agreement.\r\nWe are also pleased that this year’s draft resolution \r\non sustainable fisheries has strengthened the call to \r\nMember States, both individually and collectively, \r\nto conserve and sustainably use fish stocks, in line \r\nwith our broader efforts to promote healthy marine \r\necosystems. It has been a productive year at the United \r\nNations for sustainable fisheries. We are glad that \r\nthe new draft resolution acknowledges the important \r\noutcome of the resumed Review Conference of the \r\nUnited Nations on the Fish Stocks Agreement, at which \r\ndelegations consolidated and strengthened numerous \r\nrecommendations, including on issues related to the \r\nconservation and management of stocks and improving \r\nmonitoring, control, surveillance and enforcement.\r\nWe also appreciate the discussion on the \r\nimplementation of previous resolution language \r\nconcerning bottom fishing on vulnerable marine \r\necosystems and the long-term sustainability of deep-\r\nsea fish stocks. There is widespread recognition that \r\nconsiderable progress has been made in managing \r\nbottom fishing and preventing significant adverse \r\nimpacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems over the \r\npast decade, including the establishment of new \r\nregional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) \r\nand binding conservation measures. The United \r\nNations reviews and recommendations were essential \r\nelements of that effort. However, the draft resolution \r\nalso emphasizes that such progress remains uneven. \r\nImplementation urgently needs to be strengthened by \r\nStates and RFMOs.\r\nThis year’s draft resolution on sustainable fisheries \r\nalso contains important new or revised language in \r\nother priority areas. For example, delegations agreed \r\nto revise certain references to the Doha and Hong Kong \r\nministerial mandates in the draft resolution that have \r\nbecome outdated in order to reflect that members of \r\nthe World Trade Organization (WTO) are no longer \r\nnegotiating under the Doha Development Agenda \r\n(DDA) framework. While the draft resolution on \r\nsustainable fisheries quotes paragraph 173 of resolution \r\n66/288, “The future we want”, including its references \r\nto the DDA and the Doha and Hong Kong ministerial \r\nmandates, these references have been included in the \r\nfisheries resolution since 2012 and are maintained for \r\nhistorical accuracy only.\r\nThose references in no way override or supersede \r\nthe WTO Nairobi Ministerial Declaration, which was \r\nagreed by all members of the WTO in December 2015. \r\nAt the WTO Ministerial Conference, WTO members \r\ncould not agree to reaffirm the DDA. As a result, \r\nWTO members are no longer negotiating under the \r\nDDA framework. Therefore, the United States firmly \r\nconsiders that the remaining historical references to the \r\nDDA and Doha and Hong Kong ministerial mandates \r\nin the draft resolution on sustainable fisheries have \r\nno standing and do not serve as precedent for future \r\nnegotiated documents. The draft resolution on \r\nsustainable fisheries also welcomes the entry into \r\nforce of the Port State Measures Agreement, a key \r\naccomplishment of the international community that \r\nwill help strengthen our efforts to combat illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing.\r\nConsistent with the emphasis on climate and the \r\ndraft resolution on oceans, the draft resolution on \r\nsustainable fisheries includes important language, \r\ncalling upon States and RFMOs to appropriately \r\nconsider climate change and ocean acidification when \r\nestablishing conservation and management measures, \r\nas well as strengthening cooperation to exchange \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n22/29 16-41791\r\nrelated scientific information and best practices. The \r\ndraft resolution also recognizes the importance of work \r\nto rebuild stocks, combat IUU fishing and address ghost \r\nfishing by abandoning lost or discarded fishing gear.\r\nBoth the draft resolution on sustainable fisheries \r\nand the draft resolution on oceans this year recall the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s decision to convene the United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation \r\nof Sustainable Development Goal 14, to be held in \r\nNew York in June 2017. We thank Fiji and Sweden \r\nfor co-hosting the Conference and welcome it as an \r\nopportunity for the global community to identify \r\nfurther cooperation and efforts needed to implement the \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14 targets to conserve \r\nand sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine \r\nresources for sustainable development.\r\nThe United States would like to thank Director \r\nGabriele Goettsche-Wanli and the staff of the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for their \r\nexpertise and support on both draft resolutions. We \r\nwould also like to thank Mr. Thembile Joyini of South \r\nAfrica for his coordination of the draft resolution on \r\noceans and Mr. Andreas Kravik of Norway for his \r\ncoordination of the draft resolution on fisheries. Both \r\ndid an outstanding job.\r\nFinally, we would like to express our appreciation \r\nfor the delegation’s hard work and cooperation in \r\ncrafting both draft resolutions. It is our hope that this \r\nspirit of cooperation will characterize our efforts to \r\naddress the numerous and complex issues that lie ahead \r\nfor the ocean.\r\nMr. Morales López (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe delegation of Colombia would like to respectfully \r\nbegin our statement by expressing our sincere thanks \r\nto Mr. Thembile Elphus Joyini of South Africa and \r\nMr. Andreas Motzfeldt Kravik of Norway for their \r\ntireless efforts as coordinators of the draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.26 and A/71/L.24, entitled, respectively, \r\n“Oceans and the law of the sea” and “Sustainable \r\nfisheries, including through the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks, and related instruments”, by conducting the \r\ndiscussions with skill, transparency and a constructive \r\nspirit, which reflected the diversity that was present \r\nduring consultations on the part of all States that \r\nparticipated in them.\r\nColombia is a nation with enormous marine \r\ndiversity. Thanks to its biogeographic conditions, with \r\ncoasts on both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, it is \r\nconsidered to be a privileged country with an enormous \r\nvariety of marine and coastal ecosystems, whose health \r\ndepends not only on coherent and responsible national \r\nmanagement but also on that of other countries abutting \r\nthose oceans.\r\nAs a highly diverse country, Colombia is committed \r\nto conserving, protecting and sustainably developing \r\nthose oceans by implementing policies, plans and \r\nprogrammes that emphasize the issue’s national, \r\nregional and global importance. The country also has a \r\nsolid institutional framework in the coastal and marine \r\nareas, which is guided by a comprehensive vision in \r\nwhich seas, coasts and their resources become key \r\nelements of the country’s activities.\r\nFor that reason, Colombia acknowledges the \r\nvaluable contribution that the draft resolution on \r\noceans and the law of the sea represents. However, the \r\ndraft resolution is based on the 1982 United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), a judicial \r\ninstrument that Colombia has not ratified. Therefore, \r\nthe tenets of the draft resolution are not obligatory or \r\nenforceable in my country, except for those towards \r\nwhich it has expressly shown its acceptance. Similarly, \r\nmy country does not believe that the Convention is the \r\nonly legal framework to regulate activities carried out in \r\noceans. My delegation wishes to reiterate that Colombia \r\nis developing its activity in the marine environment in \r\nstrict adherence to the international commitments that \r\nis has expressly adopted or accepted.\r\nFinally, as we have already expressed on various \r\noccasions, the draft resolution and our participation \r\nin its adoption should not be seen or interpreted \r\nas implying our express or tacit acceptance of the \r\nprovisions of UNCLOS. The constructive spirit that \r\nguides our country with respect to the oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea is founded on the firm conviction that all \r\nnations have a commitment to protect the sea and its \r\nresources, based on the fact that a sustainable future for \r\nthe world largely depends on them. Colombia is ready \r\nto cooperate with other nations in working to tackle the \r\nchallenges of protecting the health of oceans.\r\nMr. Estreme (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): First \r\nof all, allow me to thank the two coordinators for \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 23/29\r\nhaving conducted the negotiations on draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.26 and A/71/L.24, before the General \r\nAssembly today.\r\nMy delegation reiterates that the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea is one of the \r\ninternational instruments with major economic, \r\nstrategic and political implications. Its provisions \r\nconstitute a delicate balance of the rights and obligations \r\nof States, which must be respected by all Member \r\nStates. This delicate balance should be preserved, \r\nincluding when addressing new challenges pertaining \r\nto the law of the sea and in processes established within \r\nthe framework of the General Assembly, particularly \r\nthose pertaining to marine biodiversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction and the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nThe General Assembly decided to initiate a process \r\nto establish the legal framework for the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction, which contemplates \r\nthe possibility of formulating a multilateral agreement \r\nunder the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea. The Preparatory Committee convened \r\nunder resolution 69/292 should jointly and as a whole \r\naddress the conservation and sustainable use of the \r\nmarine biological diversity of areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction, in particular marine genetic resources, \r\nincluding benefit-sharing, conservation measures, \r\ncapacity-building and technology transfer, with a view \r\nto making recommendations to the General Assembly. \r\nArgentina believes that it is necessary to agree by \r\nconsensus on the scope and parameters of a possible \r\nfuture agreement as an essential step before initiating a \r\nnegotiation process.\r\nWith regard to the substance of the matter, my \r\ndelegation would like to reiterate that due consideration \r\nmust be given to what is at stake, namely, the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of biological resources of areas \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction, and that the Convention \r\nsolemnly declared that the area of the seabed and \r\nocean f loor and their subsoil beyond the limits of \r\nnational jurisdiction, as well as their resources, were \r\nthe common heritage of humankind, the exploration \r\nand exploitation of which should be carried out for the \r\nbenefit of humankind. For Argentina, that principle is \r\nthe basis for considering the issue and must be included \r\nin any future agreement.\r\nArgentina is convinced that the illicit trade in \r\nendangered species of wild f lora and fauna, including \r\nby sea, requires compliance with the rules of the \r\nConvention on International Trade in Endangered \r\nSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora and the cooperation \r\nof States to suppress such illicit trade. At the same \r\ntime, it must also be consistent with the language \r\nof the Convention so as to avoid confusion among \r\nlegal institutions and the applicable remedies under \r\ninternational law.\r\nArgentina would like to thank the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf for its arduous \r\nand ongoing work. With more extended sessions, some \r\nchallenges have arisen. The draft resolution that we will \r\nadopt again provides for some provisional measures, \r\nto address, in particular, the issues of workspace and \r\nmedical coverage. However, it is still necessary to \r\nwork towards ensuring a permanent solution to the \r\nissues raised.\r\nThe function of the Commission is very important \r\nfor Member States. We must therefore ensure that \r\nit be provided with adequate resources and needed \r\nconditions of service. We hope that, in the framework \r\nof the open-ended working group on the conditions of \r\nservice of the members of the Commission, Member \r\nStates will continue to make efforts so that emerging \r\nchallenges are addressed effectively and expeditiously. \r\nIn this regard, the continued assistance of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is highly relevant.\r\nIn addition, I would like to recall that the \r\nCommission’s work pertains to demarcating the limit \r\nalready established in article 76, and not to the rights \r\nof coastal States. Paragraph 3, article 77, part VI, of the \r\nConvention provides that\r\n“[t]he rights of the coastal State over the \r\ncontinental shelf do not depend on occupation, \r\neffective or notional, or on any express proclamation.”\r\nThat is reflected in paragraph 80 of draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.26, on oceans and the law of the sea.\r\nArgentina welcomes this year as the twentieth \r\nanniversary of the International Tribunal for the Law of \r\nthe Sea and wishes to acknowledge the contributions to \r\nthe development of international law, and of the law of \r\nthe sea in particular, as well as the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes. The Tribunal has a highly relevant job, as \r\nthe judicial authority created by the Convention, to \r\nwork to resolve cases relating to different aspects of the \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n24/29 16-41791\r\nlaw of the sea. Argentina has supported the work of the \r\nTribunal since its establishment and is one of the State \r\nparties that have accepted its jurisdiction, to which we \r\nwelcome the fact that it has been established as the \r\nspecialized Tribunal on the law of the sea.\r\nTurning to draft resolution A/71/L.24, on \r\nsustainable fisheries, my delegation must reiterate the \r\nneed to avoid diverging from the rule with regard to any \r\nnegotiation on the law of the sea originating from the \r\nConvention and move forward by consensus.\r\nWith regard to the protection of vulnerable marine \r\necosystems, it must be recalled that, in accordance with \r\narticle 77 of the Convention, the sedentary resources of \r\nthe continental shelf are subject to the sovereignty rights \r\nof the coastal States for the full extent of that maritime \r\narea. Therefore, the conservation and management of \r\nsuch resources is under the exclusive powers of coastal \r\nStates, which have the responsibility to adopt the \r\nnecessary measures regarding such resources and their \r\nassociated ecosystems that could be affected by fishing \r\npractices having a destructive impact, including bottom \r\nfishing in the high seas. In that regard, Argentina has \r\nadopted measures for the conservation of the sedentary \r\nresources and vulnerable marine ecosystems along the \r\nfull extent of its continental shelf.\r\nMy country wishes to reiterate its concern about the \r\ntrend towards attempts to legitimize through General \r\nAssembly resolutions efforts by regional fisheries \r\nmanagement organizations to adopt measures beyond \r\ntheir spatial, material and personal scope of application. \r\nArgentina objects to such interpretations of General \r\nAssembly resolutions. Argentina also expresses its \r\nconcern about the attempts to legitimize, through \r\npronouncements of the Assembly, actions of groups of \r\nStates that seek to regulate matters pertaining to the \r\nmarine biological diversity of zones beyond national \r\njurisdiction, when there is no universally agreed legal \r\nframework allowing for such actions.\r\nFinally, Argentina expresses its acknowledgement \r\nand thanks to all the staff of the Division of Ocean \r\nAffairs and the Law of the Sea for their professionalism \r\nand hopes that the measures to strengthen the resources \r\nto the Division provided for in the draft resolution on \r\noceans and the law of the sea will be approved within the \r\nframework of the Fifth Committee in a timely manner.\r\nMr. Akahori (Japan): Japan is a country \r\nsurrounded entirely by the sea. Every year, on the third \r\nMonday in July, the Japanese celebrate Marine Day, a \r\nnational holiday, to express gratitude to the blessings \r\nof the sea and pray for prosperity as a maritime nation. \r\nSince ancient times, the sea has blessed us with food \r\nand continues to provide trade routes with all countries. \r\nJapan’s activities on matters related to the ocean and \r\nthe law of the sea are based on this sense of gratitude.\r\nJapan is happy to co-sponsor draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.26, on the oceans and the law of the sea, along \r\nwith more than 30 Member States. Open and stable \r\nseas are essential for the peace and prosperity of the \r\ninternational community as a whole, and it is necessary \r\nto maintain and promote them. The promotion of the \r\nrule of law at sea is therefore extremely important. \r\nThat is why Prime Minister Abe has emphasized the \r\nfollowing three principles on the rule of law at sea.\r\nFirst, States should make and clarify their claims \r\nbased on international law. Secondly, States should \r\nnot use force or coercion in trying to advance their \r\nclaims. Thirdly, States should seek to settle disputes by \r\npeaceful means. The draft resolution includes the spirit \r\nof all these principles. By adopting the draft resolution, \r\nMember States can express their collective will to \r\nuphold these principles.\r\nJapan welcomes the increasingly important role \r\nof the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea \r\nin the peaceful resolution of maritime disputes. We \r\ncongratulate the Tribunal on its twentieth anniversary. \r\nWe sincerely hope that the Tribunal will contribute \r\nto strengthening the rule of law at sea through the \r\naccumulation of important judgments. Japan’s support \r\nfor the Tribunal’s twentieth anniversary symposium \r\nin Hamburg this past October is a symbol of our high \r\nregard for it and its continued role. Japan is the largest \r\nassessed contributor to the Tribunal and will continue \r\nto support its activities by providing highly qualified \r\nlegal professionals.\r\nJapan appreciates the International Seabed \r\nAuthority’s steady implementation of its mandate \r\nto build a maritime legal order concerning the \r\ninternational seabed area. A balanced approach \r\nto the exploitation of the deep seabed which takes \r\nenvironmental conservation into account is needed. \r\nJapan will continue to contribute to constructive \r\ndiscussions on formulating an exploitation code that \r\nstrikes a reasonable balance between exploitation \r\nand the environment. Japan will also continue to be \r\nactively engaged with the work of the Authority, whose \r\nimportance is ever increasing in terms of human and \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 25/29\r\nfinancial resources. We are committed to proactively \r\ncontributing to the development of a legal order for the \r\ndeep seabed through the Authority.\r\nJapan recognizes the important role played by the \r\nCommission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nand has consistently contributed human and financial \r\nresources to support its activities. We decided to \r\nnominate Professor Toshitsugu Yamazaki of the \r\nUniversity of Tokyo as a candidate for next year’s \r\nelections to the Commission. Professor Yamazaki is one \r\nof Japan’s most prominent marine geologists. We are \r\nconfident that he will continue the tradition of Japanese \r\nmembers of the Commission, including current member \r\nProfessor Urabe, of making a strong contribution to the \r\nCommission’s work.\r\nWe are contributing to enable the participation of \r\nmembers of the Commission from developing countries. \r\nFor that purpose, as part of our financial support to \r\nthe Commission, we have contributed approximately \r\n$56,000 this year to the Trust Fund. We are looking \r\ninto further increasing that contribution next year. We \r\nhope that our contributions, together with those of all \r\nother Member States, will lead to the continued and \r\nrapid progress of the work of the Commission.\r\nThe world unfortunately continues to confront \r\na wide range of non-traditional maritime-security \r\nchallenges. As a country that benefits from maritime \r\ntrade, Japan believes that it is vital to respond to piracy \r\nand armed robbery, which endanger sea lanes. We are \r\na proud contributor to international anti-piracy efforts \r\non this front.\r\nJapan has continuously deployed its Self-Defense \r\nForces in anti-piracy operations off the coast of Somalia \r\nand in the Gulf of Aden since 2009. Further, in Asia, we \r\nhave contributed human and financial resources to the \r\nactivities of the Regional Cooperation Agreement on \r\nCombating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships \r\nin Asia, which celebrated its tenth anniversary this \r\nyear. Japan has provided seamless support to coastal \r\nStates seeking to increase their capacity to strengthen \r\nmaritime-law enforcement. This support includes \r\nofficial development assistance, defence-equipment \r\ncooperation and capacity-building assistance with the \r\ngoal of securing the rule of law. We hope to further \r\nenhance this assistance going forward.\r\nLast year, resolution 69/292 launched the \r\nconsultative process to develop an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction. Japan welcomes \r\nthe two sessions of the Preparatory Committee that were \r\nheld this year for that purpose. Japan recognizes the \r\ngreat importance of the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biological diversity beyond areas of \r\nnational jurisdiction, and will continue to actively \r\nsupport the Preparatory Committee’s work to develop a \r\nwell-balanced, international legally binding instrument \r\nthat benefits the entire international community.\r\nFinally, with regard to the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) that pertain to the ocean, we welcome the \r\nplans to hold the high-level United Nations Conference \r\nto Support the Implementation of SDG 14 in New York \r\nnext year.\r\nBefore concluding, Japan would like to thank the \r\ndelegation of South Africa for its important role in \r\nfacilitating draft resolution A/71/L.26. We are also \r\ngrateful to all Member States and the Secretariat for \r\ntheir support during the informal consultations. Japan \r\nis confident that this same spirit of cooperation will \r\ncontinue after the draft resolution’s adoption in the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMrs. Nguyen Phuong Nga (Viet Nam): At the \r\noutset, I would like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor the comprehensive reports contained in documents \r\nA/71/74 and A/71/74/Add.1, which provide information \r\non recent developments relating to oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea and emphasize the importance of the \r\nsustainable development of oceans and seas.\r\nWe would also like to express our appreciation \r\nfor the enormous efforts of the General Assembly and \r\nits subsidiary organs, especially the outcomes of the \r\nseventeenth meeting of United Nations Open-ended \r\nInformal Consultative Process on Oceans and the Law \r\nof the Sea and the twenty-sixth Meeting of States Parties \r\nto the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea. We encourage the General Assembly to take into \r\naccount and support the recommendations contained in \r\nthe reports of those meetings.\r\nWe welcome the outcomes of various meetings of the \r\nAd Hoc Open-ended Informal Working Group to study \r\nissues relating to the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof marine biological diversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction as further steps towards an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Viet \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n26/29 16-41791\r\nNam appreciates the successful activities of the organs \r\nestablished by the Convention, including the twenty-\r\nsecond session of the International Seabed Authority, \r\nand the collaborative efforts of the Commission on \r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf to consider the \r\nsubmissions made by States parties. We especially \r\nvalue the role, contribution and jurisdiction of the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea and other \r\ndispute-settlement mechanisms in the interpretation \r\nand application of UNCLOS.\r\nAfter more than 30 years since its creation and \r\nmore than 20 years since its entry into force, UNCLOS \r\nhas been the most important legal document regulating \r\nall activities in the oceans and seas, contributing \r\nto peace and security and ensuring safety, security \r\nand freedom of navigation and overflight at sea. \r\nUNCLOS provides a comprehensive legal framework \r\nfor the peaceful, equitable, sustainable and efficient \r\nmanagement and use of marine resources for the \r\nprosperity of humankind. It obliges the States parties, \r\nwhether big or small, to fully implement its provisions \r\nin good faith and in a responsible manner so that the \r\nsovereignty, legitimate rights and interests of all States \r\nare respected. Moreover, the Convention has provided a \r\ncomprehensive and efficient framework for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nAs a State party to the Convention and a coastal \r\nState on the East Sea, Viet Nam attaches great \r\nimportance to the peace, stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the oceans and seas. Viet Nam was \r\namong the first countries to sign and ratify the \r\nConvention and has always adhered to its provisions, \r\nrespected the legitimate rights and interests of other \r\nnations and actively participated in activities within the \r\nframework of the Convention. Viet Nam encourages the \r\nGeneral Assembly to pay due attention to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and conservation of marine diversity. \r\nViet Nam urges all nations to respect and fulfil their \r\nobligations to ensure peace, stability and sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the oceans, according to the Convention \r\nand international law.\r\nThe ocean is an invaluable gift of nature to \r\nhumankind, and it is our responsibility to preserve it \r\nfor present and future generations. However, recent \r\ncomplicated developments in some parts of the world, \r\nincluding the East Sea, are posing a threat to international \r\npeace, security and sustainable development. We \r\ntherefore call upon all parties concerned to exercise \r\nself-restraint, solve disputes by peaceful means in \r\naccordance with international law, including UNCLOS, \r\nfully respect diplomatic and legal processes, implement \r\nthe Declaration on the Conduct of Parties in the South \r\nChina Sea and expedite the completion of the code of \r\nconduct for the South China Sea.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reaffirm Viet \r\nNam’s commitment to the objectives and purposes of \r\nUNCLOS. We look forward to the high-level United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals 14: Conserve and \r\nsustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources \r\nfor sustainable development, to be held in June 2017, \r\nand will work closely with Member States to make the \r\nConference a great success.\r\nMr. Yelchenko (Ukraine): More than 25 years ago, \r\nas a young diplomat I spoke for the first time from this \r\nvery rostrum on this agenda item. Today, I would like \r\nto express our gratitude to the Secretariat and to the \r\nDivision for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea for \r\nthe work done during the intervening years, including \r\nthe preparation of this year’s annual report on oceans \r\nand the law of the sea and its addendum (A/71/74).\r\nThe issue of the marine environment continues \r\nto be a matter of most serious concern due to climate \r\nchange, marine debris, overfishing and illegal fishing. \r\nIt is therefore important to keep working to fulfil our \r\ncommitments under the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, Goal 14 of which recognizes the importance of \r\noceans and their resources. We welcome the sustainable \r\nfisheries draft resolution (A/71/L.24), which addresses \r\nthe problem of illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfisheries, which constitute a major threat to marine \r\nbiodiversity and ecosystems.\r\nUkraine is strongly committed to the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Seas (UNCLOS), \r\nthe constitution of the oceans, which reflects customary \r\ninternational law and establishes the overarching \r\nlegal framework for all activities in oceans and seas. \r\nThe States parties to UNCLOS have recognized the \r\ndesirability of establishing, through the Convention, \r\nwith due regard for the sovereignty of all States, a \r\nlegal order for oceans and seas that will facilitate \r\ninternational communication and promote the peaceful \r\nuse of oceans and seas, the equitable and efficient \r\nutilization of their resources, the conservation of living \r\nresources and the study, protection and preservation of \r\nthe marine environment.\r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 27/29\r\nUnfortunately, today this universally recognized \r\nlegal order faces great challenges in Ukraine and its \r\nadjoining maritime areas. In view of the occupation \r\nof the Autonomous Republic of Crimea and the city \r\nof Sevastopol, Ukraine’s rights as a coastal State in \r\nmaritime zones adjacent to Crimea in the Black Sea and \r\nthe Kerch Strait have been interfered with and usurped \r\nby the aggressor State. Ukraine is unable to carry out \r\nits international obligations under the relevant treaties \r\nand conventional instruments in the maritime areas \r\nappertaining to the Crimean peninsula, including the \r\nprovision of the safety and security of navigation, the \r\nregulation of maritime traffic, the protection of the \r\nmarine environment and search and rescue.\r\nAs a result, the north-eastern part of the Black \r\nSea has literally become a grey area for international \r\nshipping, which is evidenced by the increased number \r\nof marine casualties and incidents. In this regard, \r\nit is worth mentioning that at the recent, ninety-\r\nseventh session of the Maritime Safety Committee \r\nof the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a \r\ndocument entitled “Safety and security of navigation \r\nin the north-eastern part of the Black Sea”, submitted \r\nby Ukraine and Georgia, was considered, and it was \r\nagreed that monitoring of the security and safety of \r\nnavigation in that part of the Black Sea should begin. \r\nMoreover, in September, Ukraine officially served the \r\nRussian Federation with a notification of arbitration \r\nand a statement of claim instituting ad hoc arbitral \r\nproceedings under UNCLOS to vindicate its rights as \r\na coastal State in maritime zones adjacent to Crimea \r\nin the Black Sea, the Sea of Azov and the Kerch Strait.\r\nWe would like to echo the latest report of the \r\nSecretary-General on oceans and the law of the sea, \r\nwhich emphasizes that the ability of States to maximize \r\nbenefits from oceans and seas and develop a sustainable \r\nocean-based economy depends on maintaining and \r\nenhancing the security of maritime spaces. Given that, \r\nwe condemn the incidents of piracy and armed robbery \r\nat sea, transnational organized crime and terrorism in \r\nthe maritime domain, trafficking in persons, smuggling \r\nof migrants, illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing, and other maritime activities that threaten \r\nglobal stability, security and prosperity.\r\nAlthough we are encouraged by the achievements \r\nof the international community in countering maritime \r\npiracy, Ukraine wishes to underscore that no sustainable \r\nresults are possible without dealing with the root causes \r\nof piracy and robbery at sea and bringing to justice \r\nthe perpetrators of such acts and their organizers and \r\nfacilitators on land. We express our growing concern \r\nover the high number of incidents of piracy and armed \r\nrobbery at sea in the Gulf of Guinea. At the same \r\ntime, we are glad to see that the number of the same \r\nincidents at sea off the Somalian coast has fallen to \r\nits lowest level since 1995. We are proud that Ukraine \r\nactively contributed to this positive dynamic, including \r\nthroughout the first half of our elected term in the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn conclusion, Ukraine urges coastal States, f lag \r\nStates and industry to do everything possible to ensure \r\nthe safety and security of maritime shipping, especially \r\nin high-risk regions. Ukraine stands ready to further \r\ncooperate with the States Members of the United \r\nNations, the IMO and other relevant actors, with a view \r\nto achieving the aforementioned goal, in accordance \r\nwith existing international obligations.\r\nMr. Madimi (India): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to thank Mr. Thembile Joyini of South Africa, \r\nMr. Andreas Kravik of Norway and Mrs. Margo Deiye \r\nof Nauru for coordinating this year’s draft resolutions \r\nA/7/L.26, A/71/L.24 and A/71/L.27, on oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea, sustainable fisheries, and World \r\nTuna Day, respectively, under sub-items (a) and (b) \r\nof agenda item 73. We are in fact one of the sponsors \r\nof the draft resolution on World Tuna Day, and we \r\nsupport the adoption of all three resolutions by the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nIndia has a long maritime history. We have a long \r\ncoastline — more than 7,500 kilometres — and we are \r\nlocated on the world’s major maritime trading routes. \r\nFurther, India has long been dedicated to multilateralism \r\nin the conduct of global affairs. We were one of the \r\nfirst signatories to the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), in 1982, having actively \r\nparticipated in the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nleading up to the finalization of the Convention.\r\nUNCLOS, together with related agreements, \r\nrepresents a major achievement in the codification \r\nand progressive development of international law. It \r\nenjoys the wide acceptance of 167 States parties and the \r\nEuropean Union. The Convention, which is described \r\nas the constitution of the oceans and seas, provides the \r\nlegal framework for the use of oceans and seas and their \r\nresources by establishing a delicate balance between the \r\nneed for economic and social development, on the one \r\nhand, and the need to protect and preserve the marine \r\nA/71/PV.54 07/12/2016\r\n28/29 16-41791\r\nenvironment and conserve and manage its resources, \r\non the other.\r\nThe oceans cover almost three quarters of the \r\nEarth. The States look to oceanic resources as a means \r\nto economic growth and social advancement; and \r\ndevelopment of an ocean-based economy is attracting \r\nmore attention today. It is in this context that India, \r\nin its interactions with other States, especially the \r\nlittoral States of the Indian Ocean, is underscoring the \r\nimportance of cooperation in the blue economy.\r\nIn over two decades of its operation, the Convention \r\nhas contributed pre-eminently to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the oceans and seas and to the promotion \r\nof the economic and social advancement of all peoples \r\nof the world. This is reflected in the document entitled \r\n“The future we want” (resolution 66/288, annex) \r\nechoing the Millennium Development Goals adopted in \r\n2000 and in “Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development”, the outcome document \r\nof the 2015 United Nations Sustainable Development \r\nSummit (resolution 70/1).\r\nSustainable Development Goal 14, which contains \r\nsome 10 targets, recognizes the importance and \r\ncritical role of the oceans and seas in the achievement \r\nof the post-2015 development agenda. In this regard, \r\nwe appreciate the initiative of Fiji and Sweden to \r\norganize the United Nations Conference to Support the \r\nImplementation of the Goal 14, in June 2017, coinciding \r\nwith World Oceans Day.\r\nWe must however be cognizant of the fact that \r\nrealizing the full potential of the oceans and seas \r\ndepends on carrying out ocean-based activities in a \r\nsustainable manner, in accordance with internationally \r\nagreed principles, in particular the principles contained \r\nin the Convention. Our oceans face huge challenges, \r\nincluding the deterioration of the marine environment, \r\nbiodiversity loss, climate change, illegal fishing \r\npractices and issues relating to maritime safety and \r\nsecurity, including the acts of piracy and armed \r\nrobbery at sea. We are happy to have actively engaged \r\nwith the work of the Contact Group on Piracy off the \r\nCoast of Somalia, which has significantly contributed \r\nin controlling piracy in the western Indian Ocean.\r\nWe thank the Secretary-General for his report and \r\nits addendum on issues concerning oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea (A/71/74 and A/71/74/Add.1). We note \r\nthat the report outlines the contribution of oceans to \r\nthe environmental, social and economic dimensions of \r\nsustainable development, the manner in which UNCLOS \r\naddresses those dimensions, and the opportunities for, \r\nand challenges to, the enhanced integration of the three \r\ndimensions of sustainable development in relation \r\nto oceans.\r\nWe welcome the report of the seventeenth meeting of \r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative \r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea (A/71/204), in \r\nwhich the deliberations focused on the topic of marine \r\ndebris, plastics and microplastics. We support the \r\ncontinuation of the Process for the next two years, since \r\nit is a unique forum for comprehensive discussion by all \r\nthe stakeholders on the topics of interest to the world, \r\nwithin the framework of the UNCLOS and chapter 17 \r\nof the Agenda 21. We look forward to contributing to \r\nthe discussion of the topics of the effects of climate \r\nchange on oceans and anthropogenic underwater noise.\r\nWe also welcome the report of the seventh meeting \r\nof the Ad Hoc Working Group of the Whole on the \r\nRegular Process for Global Reporting and Assessment \r\nof the State of the Marine Environment, including \r\nSocioeconomic Aspects (A/71/362). Further, we \r\nwelcome the launching of the second cycle of the regular \r\nprocess of the global integrated marine assessment to \r\nevaluate trends and identify gaps in the oceans’ health, \r\nand establish a programme of work for the period 2017-\r\n2020.\r\nAnother area of significant interest and importance \r\nto my delegation and to the international community is \r\nconservation and the sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity beyond areas of national jurisdiction. We \r\nappreciate the rich discussion and exchange of views \r\nat the first and second sessions of the Preparatory \r\nCommittee on an international legally binding \r\ninstrument on the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biological diversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction, established by the General Assembly in \r\nresolution 69/292. We look forward to the two sessions \r\nthat will be held next year in which the Preparatory \r\nCommittee will make substantive recommendations to \r\nthe General Assembly on the elements of a draft text for \r\nan international legally binding instrument under the \r\nUNCLOS. We appreciate the leadership of Mr. Eden \r\nCharles of Trinidad and Tobago and thank him for \r\nchairing and steering the Preparatory Committee \r\nproceedings in a very able manner.\r\nThe smooth functioning of the institutions \r\nestablished under the Convention, namely, the \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.54\r\n16-41791 29/29\r\nInternational Seabed Authority, the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea and the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf, hold the key \r\nto the proper implementation of the provisions of the \r\nConvention and to the realization of the desired benefits \r\nresulting from the use of the seas. We therefore support \r\nall efforts towards ensuring these institutions’ efficient \r\nand effective functioning and note with satisfaction the \r\nprogress made by them in their respective areas.\r\nFinally, India, as a responsible partner of the \r\ninternational community and as a country with a vast \r\ncoastline and numerous islands, has a long-standing \r\nand abiding interest in maritime and ocean affairs and \r\nassures its full cooperation in efforts aimed at ensuring \r\nthe proper management and sustainable use of the \r\noceans and seas.\r\nThe meeting rose at 1 p.m.\r\n"
