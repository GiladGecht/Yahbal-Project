"United Nations A/71/PV.55\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n55th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 7 December 2016, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Bouah-Kamon \r\n(Côte d’Ivoire), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 73 (continued)\r\nOceans and the law of the sea\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.27)\r\n(a) Oceans and the law of the sea\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/71/74 and \r\nA/71/74/Add.1)\r\nReport on the work of the Ad Hoc Working \r\nGroup of the Whole on the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting and Assessment of the \r\nState of the Marine Environment, including \r\nSocioeconomic Aspects (A/71/362)\r\nReport on the work of the United Nations Open-\r\nended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans \r\nand the Law of the Sea at its seventeenth \r\nmeeting (A/71/204)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.26)\r\n(b) Sustainable fisheries, including through the \r\n1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the \r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating \r\nto the Conservation and Management of \r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory \r\nFish Stocks, and related instruments\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/351)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.24)\r\nMs. Yparraguirre (Philippines): The Philippines \r\nextends its thanks and appreciation to South Africa and \r\nNorway for coordinating our annual draft resolutions \r\non oceans and the law of the sea (A/71/L.26) and \r\nsustainable fisheries (A/71/L.24) and to Palau for \r\nits work on the draft resolution on World Tuna Day \r\n(A/71/L.27).\r\nAs another year draws to a close, it comes as no \r\nsurprise that we will adopt the first two annual draft \r\nresolutions on the most massive and comprehensive \r\nsubject that we consider every year. After all, water \r\ncovers more than two thirds of the Earth’s surface, \r\nand one half of that surface comprises the high seas, \r\nwhich are beyond the jurisdiction of any State. Our \r\nsustained global cooperation is therefore paramount. \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14 of our 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development binds us to conserve and \r\nsustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources. \r\nThey form an integral and essential component of \r\nthe planet’s ecosystem and are therefore critical to \r\nsustaining it.\r\nThe Philippines is a State party to the 1995 \r\nAgreement for the Implementation of the Provisions \r\nof the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea of 10 December 1982 relating to the Conservation \r\nand Management of Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-42334 (E)\r\n*1642334*\r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n2/20 16-42334\r\nMigratory Fish Stocks, and related instruments. We are \r\ncommitted to the conservation and optimum utilization \r\nof straddling and highly migratory fish stocks, both \r\nwithin and beyond the exclusive economic zone, and the \r\nmanagement of those stocks based on a precautionary \r\napproach and the best available scientific information. \r\nThe Philippines is also committed through the United \r\nNations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\n(Rio+20) to eliminating illegal, unreported and \r\nunregulated fishing, and subsidies that contribute \r\nto such fishing and overcapacity, and to enhancing \r\nactions to protect vulnerable marine ecosystems from \r\nsignificant adverse impacts.\r\nThe draft resolution on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea before us articulates our deepening concern over \r\nthe continued threat of human activity on marine \r\nenvironments and biodiversity. It reaffirms our Rio+20 \r\ncommitments to improve our understanding of the \r\nadverse impact of climate change on oceans and seas. \r\nWe look forward to the next Informal Consultative \r\nProcess next May on the effects of climate change on \r\nthe oceans. We will also follow the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of \r\nthe Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic \r\nAspects, which has entered its second cycle. Consistent \r\nwith the Manila Declaration on Furthering the \r\nImplementation of the Global Programme of Action \r\nfor the Protection of the Marine Environment from \r\nLand-based Activities, we must enhance our action \r\nto address marine pollution, including marine debris, \r\nwhich compromises the health of the oceans and marine \r\nbiodiversity. We need to neutralize, if not reverse, the \r\nadverse economic, social and environmental impacts \r\nof the physical alteration and destruction of marine \r\nhabitats that might result from land-based and coastal \r\ndevelopment activities.\r\nMoreover, in remaining consistent with the 2010 \r\nManila amendments to the International Convention on \r\nStandards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping \r\nfor Seafarers, we must enhance maritime safety and \r\nsecurity, and combat piracy. The Philippines once again \r\ncalls on all States that have not yet done so to ratify \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS), our constitution for the oceans and seas, \r\nand contribute to its universality. UNCLOS has become \r\nthe key to ensuring global and regional peace in our \r\njust and sustainable use of the world’s oceans and their \r\nresources, representing a delicate and careful balance of \r\nthe rights and obligations of all States parties, whether \r\nbig or small, rich or poor, or coastal or landlocked.\r\nOur commitment to the rule of law and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes extends to the 12 July \r\naward rendered by the arbitral tribunal constituted \r\nunder annex VII of UNCLOS for the settlement of \r\ndisputes. In clarifying the maritime entitlements of the \r\nrelevant parties, that decision has upheld the primacy \r\nof international law as the cornerstone for a rules-\r\nbased regional and international order. It is final and \r\nbinding on the parties and is now part of international \r\njurisprudence in the maritime domain.\r\nIn that spirit, the Philippines reaffirms its support \r\nfor the treaty bodies. We continue to follow the judicial \r\nwork of the International Tribunal for the Law of the \r\nSea, and we join in the commemoration of its twentieth \r\nanniversary this year. We also attach great importance \r\nto the work of the International Seabed Authority, \r\nwhich seeks to more equitably and more sustainably \r\nmanage the mineral-related activities in the Area and \r\nour common heritage and its contribution to capacity-\r\nbuilding and marine scientific research. We also \r\napplaud the progress in the work of the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf in considering \r\nsubmissions on the establishment of the outer limits \r\nof the continental shelf beyond 200 nautical miles, in \r\nconformity with article 76 of UNCLOS.\r\nThe Philippines looks forward to another important \r\nyear next year, when we will discuss the specifics of \r\na future international legally binding instrument \r\nunder UNCLOS on the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of marine biological diversity of areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction. We will also dissect Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14 at a conference meant to address \r\nhow to best conserve and sustainably use the oceans, \r\nseas and marine resources for sustainable development.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): The past \r\nyear witnessed remarkable achievements in the work \r\nof the three institutions that are based on the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea, namely, the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority (ISA), the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf (CLCS) and the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. In that \r\nconnection, I wish to express my congratulations on \r\ntheir achievements.\r\nI also wish to thank the Division for Ocean Affairs \r\nand the Law of the Sea for its diligent work as the \r\nsecretariat that has ensured the smooth conduct of the \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 3/20\r\nnecessary work. Draft resolutions A/71/L.26, entitled \r\n“Oceans, the law of the sea”, and A/71/L.24, on \r\nsustainable fisheries, take stock of overall developments \r\nin international oceans and the law of the sea over the \r\npast year. Draft resolution A/71/L.27, on World Tuna \r\nDay, is of great significance, as it demonstrates our \r\ncommitment to the protection of marine biological \r\nresources. The Chinese delegation has played an \r\nactive and constructive part in the consultations on the \r\naforementioned resolutions. I would also like to express \r\nmy appreciation to the facilitators for their efforts and \r\ncontributions. While much progress has been made in \r\nthe area of the oceans and the law of the sea, many new \r\nissues and challenges have also emerged. In that regard, \r\nI wish to take this opportunity to share the Chinese \r\nposition and ideas.\r\nFirst of all, we should strengthen international \r\ncooperation so as to realize the sustainable development \r\nof the oceans and seas, which are the home of all \r\nhumankind and a valuable space for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment sets a higher bar for us in the protection \r\nand sustainable use of the oceans and seas. We must \r\nfoster the awareness of a community of humankind \r\nwith a shared future and engaged in close cooperation. \r\nWe must join hands in tackling various challenges \r\nrelating to the oceans and seas. China has put forward \r\ninitiatives for developing the blue economy and building \r\nthe 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which we believe \r\nwould greatly promote international cooperation on \r\nmaritime affairs. China hopes that the international \r\ncommunity will jointly promote the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development to \r\nrealize sustainable marine development.\r\nSecondly, we must promote the rule of law on \r\nthe oceans and seas and establish and maintain a fair \r\nand reasonable maritime order. The United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea has provided a \r\ncomprehensive legal framework and the foundation \r\nfor the maritime activities of States parties. It has \r\nset forth balanced provisions regarding the rights \r\nand obligations of States parties with regard to the \r\npeaceful use and conservation of the oceans and seas. \r\nAll parties must uphold the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Convention and interpret and apply the Convention \r\nand its dispute-settlement mechanism with goodwill \r\nand in an accurate and comprehensive manner, and \r\nmust avoid abusing its provisions. In that respect, the \r\nTribunal can play a more positive role. This year marks \r\nthe twentieth anniversary of the Tribunal, and China \r\nwishes to congratulate it on its achievements over the \r\npast 20 years. We hope the Tribunal will continue to \r\nmake efforts to effectively safeguard the authority and \r\nintegrity of the Convention.\r\nChina appreciates the positive contribution made \r\nby the Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf to maintaining the balance of the legitimate rights \r\nand interests of coastal States, on the one hand, and \r\nthe overall interests of the international community, \r\non the other. The Commission also seeks to promote \r\nthe stability of the international maritime order. We \r\nsupport the Commission in its efforts to continue to \r\nfulfil its responsibilities, in strict compliance with the \r\nConvention and its own rules of procedure. \r\nThirdly, we must fully coordinate our positions and \r\nsteadily advance international maritime governance. \r\nRight now, the attention of the international community \r\nis focused on the negotiation of an international \r\nagreement on the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof marine biological diversity beyond the areas of \r\nnational jurisdiction. Parties should engage in thorough \r\nexchanges and consultations during the negotiations, \r\nand fully consider the legitimate need of countries, \r\ndeveloping countries in particular, to use marine \r\nbiological resources. Parties should also advance the \r\nnegotiation process steadily. It is undesirable to seek a \r\nresult in haste. The new agreement must not compromise \r\nthe rights of navigation, scientific research, fishing and \r\nmining that countries enjoy under the Convention.\r\nThe priority of the work of the International Seabed \r\nAuthority is to formulate regulations governing the \r\nexploitation of seabed resources. As such regulations \r\nbear most directly on the exploitation of the \r\ninternational seabed mineral resources, the Authority \r\nneeds to hear the views and ideas of all sides, take a \r\nprudent approach in its considerations and conduct its \r\nwork in a progressive manner and on a sound scientific \r\nand factual basis.\r\nThe Chinese Government attaches great \r\nimportance to and actively supports international \r\nendeavours in the areas of  oceans affairs and the law \r\nof the sea, and has made donations, within its capacity, \r\nto ISA and CLCS in support of their work. China is in \r\nfavour of the provisions in this year’s draft resolution \r\non oceans and the law of the sea that seek to include the \r\nlandlocked developing countries and middle-income \r\ncountries in difficult circumstances in the scope of \r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n4/20 16-42334\r\ncapacity-building assistance and technical assistance. \r\nWe believe that this is conducive to promoting a greater \r\ncontribution of developing countries to the oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea affairs and will be helpful to the \r\ncommon development of all countries.\r\nChina highly values peace and stability in the \r\nSouth China Sea. We have always taken a constructive \r\nand responsible approach in addressing the issue of the \r\nSouth China Sea. Currently, thanks to the joint efforts of \r\nChina and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, \r\nthe situation in the South China Sea is developing in a \r\npositive direction. The issue is back on the right track of \r\ndialogue and consultations. We hope that all countries \r\nconcerned will work with us to seek a solution to the \r\ndispute through negotiations and consultations in a \r\njoint effort to maintain peace and stability in the South \r\nChina Sea. The so-called arbitration on the South China \r\nSea is, however, null and void and is absolutely not \r\nbinding. China does not accept it, has not participated \r\nin it and does not recognize it. In the interest of the \r\ninternational rule of law, the page has been turned on \r\nthe so-calledarbitration.\r\nChina will always act as a defender of the \r\ninternational maritime rule of law, a builder of \r\na harmonious maritime order and a promoter of \r\nsustainable marine development. We look forward to \r\ncontinued efforts to strengthen cooperation with all \r\ncountries so as to further promote the protection and \r\nsustainable use of oceans and seas.\r\nMr. Drobnjak (Croatia): Croatia aligns itself \r\nwith the statement delivered earlier by the observer \r\nof the European Union (see A/71/PV.54). I will make \r\nseveral brief remarks and limit them to draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.27, on the proclamation of World Tuna Day.\r\nAs a country with more than 6,000 kilometres of \r\ncoastline along our mainland and islands combined, \r\nCroatia is proud to be one of the sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolution. The fact that it has attracted almost \r\n60 sponsors from all regions of the world confirms \r\nthe awareness of global communities of the need to \r\nsafeguard tuna, and through it, protect the value of \r\nworld oceans and seas and their resources. In particular, \r\nCroatia would like to express its gratitude to the Republic \r\nof Nauru and the other countries of the Pacific small \r\nisland developing States group for their engagement in \r\npresenting draft resolution A/71/L.27, which serves as \r\na testament to the high level of the world’s awareness \r\nof the efforts to protect and safeguard the tuna species.\r\nTuna fishing has had a long tradition in Croatia \r\nsince the fifteenth century, and that highly valuable \r\nand nutritious fish species has proven to be a precious \r\ncommodity and food source for generations of \r\nCroatians. With the aim of honouring the tuna, once \r\nCroatia had gained independence and started minting \r\nits own coins, our country paid tribute to the tuna fish \r\nin 1994 by putting it on its two-kuna coin. Croatia thus \r\nstands proud as the only country in the world with the \r\ntuna fish featured on its official currency.\r\nTuna fishing and farming form an important part \r\nof the local economy of Croatia’s coastal regions. The \r\nAtlantic bluefin tuna is the most widespread species in the \r\nAdriatic Sea and an important export product of Croatia \r\nthat is sold worldwide. Needless to say, tuna stocks \r\nare not infinite. In fact, the species is classified today \r\nas “endangered” by the Convention on International \r\nTrade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. \r\nTherefore, every national and international effort to \r\nprotect and conserve the species is as important as it is \r\nnecessary, whether on the part of national authorities or \r\non the part of international organizations.\r\nIn closing, Croatia is looking forward to further \r\ncooperation with all like-minded countries in \r\nprotecting the tuna species. Let us hope that the newly \r\nproclaimed World Tuna Day will send a strong and \r\npositive message aimed at raising awareness of the \r\nimportance and vulnerability of the species. By doing \r\nso, the world community will help in preserving tuna \r\nas a food resource as well as a driver of economic \r\ndevelopment and employment for coastal communities. \r\nMoreover, it will serve as another small but important \r\npositive contribution towards the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nMs. Sigurðardóttir (Iceland): The oceans are of \r\nfundamental importance to all life on earth. They are \r\nimportant in food security, as routes for international \r\ntransportation and communication, and as factors in the \r\nworld’s weather and climate systems. It is imperative \r\nfor all of us, individually and collectively, to keep our \r\noceans clean and the marine environment healthy.\r\nThe many yearly activities related to oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea at the United Nations are a testament to \r\nthe importance of that field. The United Nations Open-\r\nended Informal Consultative Process on Oceans and \r\nthe Law of the Sea, the Regular Process and the annual \r\nnegotiations on the two landmark draft resolutions \r\nthat we are discussing today are a few examples of the \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 5/20\r\nnumerous oceans-related processes. Additionally, this \r\nyear we undertook reviews of the 1995 United Nations \r\nFish Stocks Agreement and the impacts of bottom \r\nfishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems.\r\nThe entry into force of the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations Agreement on \r\nPort State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate \r\nIllegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing in June is \r\nwelcomed by Iceland, as it provides an important tool \r\nto prevent, deter and eliminate illegal, unreported and \r\nunregulated fishing.\r\nThe importance of oceans is further confirmed by \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14, which addresses the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and \r\nmarine resources. Seas and oceans have great potential \r\nfor innovation and growth in a number of sectors and \r\nin contributing to poverty eradication and sustained \r\neconomic growth. \r\nThe sustainable management of the oceans will \r\nbe in focus next year at both the High-level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development and the Conference \r\nto Support the Implementation of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14, which is meant to underpin \r\nexisting processes and encourage wider partnerships \r\nin that field. Iceland will participate actively in those \r\nevents, sharing experiences and working with other \r\nstakeholders to mark the way towards achieving our \r\ncommon goal of healthy oceans and the sustainable use \r\nof marine resources.\r\nIceland stresses the importance of including \r\noceans-related considerations in the implementation of \r\nclimate policies. According to scientific information, \r\nthe period from 2011 to 2015 was the warmest five-year \r\nperiod on record globally, with 2015 the warmest year \r\non record to date. Arctic sea ice continued its rapid \r\ndecline in the same period, reaching the lowest winter \r\nmaximum on record in 2016 for the second year in a \r\nrow. In Iceland, we are also witnessing the accelerating \r\nrecession of our glaciers and record high temperatures \r\nin recent years.\r\nThat development has direct consequences for the \r\noceans. Global sea levels have continued to rise in recent \r\nyears, fish stocks are changing distribution owing to \r\nchanging temperatures in the oceans, and within a few \r\ndecades we may even see an ice-free Arctic during the \r\nsummer. Orchestrated action in that field by the global \r\ncommunity has never been more urgent. We therefore \r\nwelcome the decision by the Assembly to focus the \r\ndiscussions at the next Informal Consultative Process \r\non the theme of the effects of climate change on oceans.\r\nInternational cooperation, coordinated solutions \r\nand a common legal framework are needed to address \r\nthe challenges facing the oceans and the marine \r\nenvironment. The core international legal instrument \r\nin that field is the 1982 United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), which establishes the \r\noverarching legal framework within which all activities \r\non the oceans and seas must be carried out.\r\nTwo implementing agreements under UNCLOS are \r\nalready in force, and the General Assembly decided in \r\nresolution 69/292 to commence development of a third \r\none. A Preparatory Committee was established by that \r\nresolution to develop an international legally binding \r\ninstrument under UNCLOS on the conservation and \r\nsustainable use of marine biological diversity of \r\nareas beyond national jurisdiction, and it has worked \r\ndiligently this past year under the able chairmanship of \r\nHis Excellency Ambassador Eden Charles of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago. By the end of next year, the Committee \r\nwill make substantive recommendations to the \r\nGeneral Assembly on the elements of a draft text of an \r\ninternational, legally binding instrument on that issue.\r\nIceland participates actively in that work and \r\nhas consistently emphasized the importance of the \r\nmandate of resolution 69/292. Issues already subject \r\nto an adequate international legal regime should not \r\nbe reopened, and, as prescribed in paragraph 3 of that \r\nresolution, the work \r\n“should not undermine existing relevant legal \r\ninstruments and frameworks and relevant global, \r\nregional and sectoral bodies”.\r\nA good example of that is high-seas fisheries, which \r\nare subject to the legal regime of the Law of the Sea \r\nConvention, which is complemented by the 1995 United \r\nNations Fish Stocks Agreement. The future instrument \r\ngoverning areas beyond national jurisdiction must, \r\naccordingly, adapt to those and other existing legal \r\ninstruments. \r\nIn Iceland’s view, the greatest challenge for the \r\nnegotiations on the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof marine biological diversity beyond areas of national \r\njurisdiction will be finding a solution to how this can \r\nbest be done. We look forward to the constructive \r\nwork of the Preparatory Committee in 2017 and to its \r\nconsensus-based outcome before the end of next year.\r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n6/20 16-42334\r\nIceland attaches great importance to the work of \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf. \r\nWe take note of the serious concern expressed in draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.26 on the oceans and the law of the \r\nsea with respect to the critical lack of funds in the \r\nvoluntary trust fund for the purpose of defraying the \r\ncost of participation of developing States members of \r\nthe Commission in the meetings of the Commission. \r\nWe will continue to make contributions to the trust fund \r\nand encourage other Member States to do the same.\r\nThis year, we celebrate the twentieth anniversary of \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Iceland \r\npays tribute to the Tribunal’s important contribution \r\nto the peaceful settlement of disputes concerning the \r\nlaw of the sea. As we approach the election of judges \r\nnext year, we are encouraged by nominations of female \r\ncandidates and hope for a better gender balance in the \r\nvery near future.\r\nIceland highly appreciates the valuable assistance \r\nStates enjoy in their work in the field of oceans and the \r\nlaw of the sea. We are particularly grateful to all the \r\nable staff at the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law \r\nof the Sea for their unflagging support and outstanding \r\nwork. We also want to commend the facilitator of the \r\ndraft resolution on sustainable fisheries (A/71/L.24), \r\nMr. Andreas Kravik of Norway, and the facilitator \r\nof the draft resolution on oceans and law of the sea \r\n(A/71/L.26), Mr. Thembile Joyini of South Africa, \r\nfor their professional work and able stewardship in \r\nthe negotiations of these draft resolutions. Finally, \r\nwe would like to thank their predecessors, Ms. Alice \r\nRevell of New Zealand and Ambassador Eden Charles \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago, for their excellent work in \r\nrecent years.\r\nIceland is heavily dependent on the sustainable use \r\nof living marine resources. Healthy oceans and robust \r\nmarine ecosystems remain a constant concern for our \r\nnation of seafarers and fishermen, and international \r\ncooperation towards that aim is a long-standing priority \r\nfor us. We therefore welcome the adoption of the two \r\nannual landmark resolutions in this field, as well as \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.27 on World Tuna Day under \r\ndiscussion here today. Iceland stands ready for another \r\nactive year of ocean affairs in 2017.\r\nMr. Daunivalu (Fiji): I would like to begin by \r\nthanking the President of the General Assembly for \r\nconvening today’s debate under  sub-items (a) and (b) \r\nof agenda item 73, on oceans and the law of the sea and \r\nsustainable fisheries, respectively. These are of course \r\nissues of great importance to Fiji and the Pacific. The \r\ngrowing prominence of oceans issues at the United \r\nNations in 2016, and, naturally, in the coming year, is \r\nindeed gratifying for us and indicative of the President’s \r\nstrong commitment to the oceans.\r\nFiji aligns itself with the statements made by \r\nthe Permanent Representative of Palau on behalf of \r\nthe Pacific small island developing States and the \r\nPermanent Representative of Micronesia on behalf of \r\nthe Pacific Islands Forum (see A/71/PV.54).\r\nWe join other delegations in commending the \r\nwork done by Mr. Thembile Joyini of South Africa, \r\nMr. Andreas Kravik of Norway and Mrs. Margo Deiye \r\nof Nauru in coordinating, under the current agenda \r\nitem, the draft resolutions on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea (A/71/L.26), sustainable fisheries (A/71/L.24) and \r\nWorld Tuna Day (A/71/L.27), respectively.\r\nFiji attaches great importance to the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). \r\nIt is a monumental achievement of the international \r\ncommunity of the United Nations, which has provided \r\nthe very foundation that gives life to the governance of \r\nour oceans and the law of the sea. Our commitment to \r\nUNCLOS is reflected by the fact that Fiji was the first \r\ncountry to ratify the Convention in 1982.\r\nFor Fiji, a large-ocean State, the ocean is the \r\nlifeblood of its economy and its people. The ocean \r\nprovides us with one of our key sources of income and \r\ntherefore of economic growth and development, which \r\nspeaks volumes for our active involvement in oceans-\r\nrelated issues at the United Nations. We very much \r\nwelcome the adoption of the draft resolution on World \r\nTuna Day, the adoption of which will certainly help raise \r\nawareness annually on the critical challenges facing \r\nour world fisheries today, including, inter alia, illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing and overfishing. In \r\nthe same vein, we look forward to the adoption of the \r\ndraft resolutions on oceans and the law of the sea and \r\non sustainable fisheries, which have been strengthened \r\nthis year by the convening of the Fish Stocks Agreement \r\nReview Conference held in May 2016.\r\nWe emphasize the vulnerability of Fiji and other \r\ncountries in our region in face of such threats as \r\nrising sea levels, climate change, ocean acidification, \r\nmarine pollution, depletion of fish stocks and the \r\nunpredictability of weather patterns, to name but a few. \r\nThese are long-standing issues that have been raised \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 7/20\r\ntime and again at the United Nations. Addressing them \r\nwill certainly require us to move beyond the business-\r\nas-usual approach. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, with the stand-alone \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14, on oceans, is a step \r\nin the right direction and reflects the diverse approaches \r\ntaken to address oceans issues.\r\nThe year 2017 marks a very important year for \r\noceans, when the global community will come together \r\nin New York from 5 to 9 June for the high-level United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14. Fiji, together with \r\nSweden, as hosts of the Conference, would like to \r\nencourage all Member States to participate at a high \r\nlevel. The June 2017 Conference will be a moment of \r\ntruth as far as the oceans are concerned. It will provide \r\nan opportunity for all stakeholders to come together to \r\nlearn more about the truth of the current state of the \r\noceans and what needs to be done to ensure we reverse \r\nthe decline in their health.\r\nThe Conference is expected to be the game-changer \r\nthat the ocean desperately needs to galvanize support \r\nand resolve once and for all for taking affirmative \r\nsteps towards saving the oceans. At the Conference, \r\nwe encourage all Governments to come forward and \r\ndevise an ambitious call to action to set a positive \r\ntone. More importantly, however, we encourage all \r\nother stakeholders to participate at the partnership \r\ndialogues and build successful partnerships with a \r\nview to advancing the implementation of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14.\r\nMrs. Rolón Candia (Paraguay) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAt the outset, my delegation aligns itself with the \r\nstatement made by the representative of Zambia on \r\nbehalf of the group of landlocked developing countries \r\n(see A/71/PV.54). In our national capacity, we wish to \r\nmake a few comments.\r\nWe too thank the Secretary-General for his report \r\non oceans and the law of the sea (A/71/74) and for the \r\nother documents related to the topic. We also wish to \r\ntake this occasion to express the high value we attach to \r\nthe work of the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law \r\nof the Sea, within the Office of Legal Affairs.\r\nThis is the first time that Paraguay is co-sponsoring \r\nthe annual draft resolution on oceans and the law of \r\nthe sea (A/71/L.26), which will be submitted to the \r\nGeneral Assembly for adoption in the next several days. \r\nWe welcome the fact that the text includes references \r\nto landlocked developing countries and, in particular, \r\nreferences to capacity-building. For Paraguay, \r\nthe inclusion of countries with our geographical \r\ncharacteristics represents progress because the \r\nchallenge of sustainably using marine resources is \r\nglobal and involves all humankind. We are aware that \r\nany action taken in the marine environment entails \r\nconsequences that will eventually affect all countries, \r\nnot just coastal States.\r\nThe value of the oceans and seas is incalculable for \r\nhumankind. My delegation recalls the commitment of \r\nthe entire international community to the conservation \r\nand appropriate use of the marine environment. We \r\nbelieve that a large share of our efforts must be directed \r\ntowards that end. Accordingly, members should pay \r\nheed to the conclusions of the report of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral with regard to the negative effects that will \r\nimpact the oceans unless urgent measures are taken on \r\na global scale to guide human behaviour and activities \r\ntowards a more sustainable use of the oceans. \r\nWith the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the signing of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nwe have made progress in establishing frameworks \r\nfor action for the years to come. The challenge lies \r\nin implementation. We emphasize that our work must \r\nbe general and collective, with a view to carrying out \r\neffective actions that encourage the use of resources \r\nin a responsible manner. We understand, therefore, \r\nthe necessity of our participation in international and \r\nregional forums on matters pertaining to the oceans and \r\nseas in order to transofrm our invaluable experiences \r\ninto policies that should contribute to the sustainability \r\nof resources.\r\nWe remind the General Assembly that landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries represent 12.5 per cent of the \r\nEarth’s surface, approximately 4 per cent of the world’s \r\npopulation and, at the United Nations, slightly more \r\nthan 16 per cent of its membership. Most global trade \r\nis facilitated through the oceans and seas. That is an \r\ninescapable reality for my country. The sustained \r\ngrowth of our economy has led to an increase in \r\ntrade leading to a greater demand for the transport \r\nof exported and imported goods — a demand that, in \r\nturn, has favoured the development of transportation \r\nservices. Today, Paraguay has the third largest f leet of \r\ninland navigation vessels in the world, which transport \r\ngoods along rivers and connect to high-seas vessels. In \r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n8/20 16-42334\r\nthat context, Paraguay reaffirms that landlocked States \r\nmust enjoy the freedom of transit through the territory \r\nof transit States by all means of transport under articles \r\n87, 91 and 125 of the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and in accordance \r\nwith the Vienna Programme of Action for Landlocked \r\nDeveloping (resolution 69/137).\r\nParaguay participated in the negotiations on \r\nUNCLOS, one of the most important multilaterally \r\nagreed instruments in history. It represents a concrete \r\nexample of humankind’s collective efforts in the \r\ndrafting of an instrument that regulates the use of \r\none of the vital resources of the planet, and its scope \r\nencompasses the political, economic and strategic \r\nspheres. The Convention has been in force for more \r\nthan two decades and is no stranger to the challenges \r\nthat globalization and growth in trade represent. My \r\ndelegation understands that it is possible to improve the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of ocean resources in \r\naccordance with international law, which means that it \r\nis necessary to continue to strengthen the institutions \r\ncreated under the Convention.\r\nFinally, in that regard, the delegation of Paraguay, \r\nnow more than ever, encourages all States to consider \r\nthe consequences of pressures placed on the seas \r\nand oceans that can seriously affect the lives of \r\nfuture generations.\r\nMr. Arrocha Olabuenaga (Mexico) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): At the outset, my delegation would like \r\nto thank Mr. Thembile Joyini of South Africa and \r\nMr. Andreas Kravik of Norway for having facilitated \r\nthe omnibus draft resolution A/71/L.26, on oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea, and draft resolution A/71/L.24, on \r\nsustainable fisheries, respectively, and for their work \r\nduring the intensive rounds of negotiations that were \r\nheld. Similarly, we express our appreciation to the \r\ndelegation of Nauru for its work on draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.27,\r\n on establishing World Tuna Day.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to highlight in \r\ngreater detail three aspects in connection with oceans \r\nand the law of the sea that are of particular relevance \r\nto my delegation. First, with respect to an international \r\nlegally binding instrument under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction, Mexico notes with \r\nsatisfaction the work carried out by the Preparatory \r\nCommittee during the two meetings that were held \r\nin 2016 with a view to drafting a legally binding \r\ninstrument. In that vein, we commend Ambassador \r\nEden Charles of Trinidad and Tobago for his work.\r\nWe welcome the progress that has been made, \r\nparticularly with regard to the guiding principles \r\nfor that instrument, the necessity to subordinate the \r\nagreement to the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea (UNCLOS) and the need to respect the \r\nsovereignty of States over their continental shelf. We \r\nexpect that our work will continue in a positive manner \r\nto develop a future agreement during the two meetings \r\nto be held in 2017. \r\nSimilarly, we underscore the work under way at the \r\nthirteenth Conference of the Parties to the Convention \r\non Biological Diversity, now being held in Mexico, \r\nparticularly in connection with that subject. We \r\nhope that, within the framework of the Conference, \r\ndecisions will be taken to step up the protection of \r\nbiological diversity in oceans and seas. We also support \r\nthe idea that the new agreement on the areas beyond \r\nnational jurisdiction should be circumscribed by \r\nUNCLOS, while providing sufficient and appropriate \r\ncomplementary elements to ensure the protection of \r\nthe areas beyond national jurisdiction, specifically in \r\nmatters relating to marine protection.\r\nSecondly, concerning the pollution of oceans \r\nand seas caused by plastic and microplastics, Mexico \r\nwelcomes the outcome of the seventeenth meeting of \r\nthe United Nations Open-ended Informal Consultative \r\nProcess on Oceans and the Law of the Sea, held this \r\npast June. In that regard, we emphasize the need to \r\ncontinue working in that area so as to better understand \r\nthe effects of such debris on marine ecosystems. My \r\ndelegation is concerned about the lack of knowledge \r\nconcerning the impact of marine debris on marine \r\necosystems and species and on human health. We call \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 9/20\r\nfor cooperation among States to confront the problem \r\nand to raise public awareness on the issue.\r\nFinally, I will mention illegal trafficking at sea and \r\nthe illegal trafficking in wildlife. Mexico notes with \r\nsatisfaction the addition of references to combating \r\nillegal maritime trade, including wildlife, in various \r\nparagraphs of the omnibus draft resolution. This is one \r\nof the priority areas in the current law of the sea agenda. \r\nWe further wish to emphasize the usefulness of \r\nvarious international conventions in place to fight \r\nillegal trafficking in protected species. Their various \r\nprovisions already constitute an effective means of \r\ntaking action. Mexico is party to those conventions, \r\nand we hereby reiterate our commitment to fighting \r\nsuch illicit trafficking in maritime areas under our \r\njurisdiction. \r\nIn conclusion, Mexico calls upon all States to \r\ncooperate and continue working to reduce instances \r\nof illicit trafficking within the framework of relevant \r\ninternational conventions. \r\nMr. Zagaynov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): For our country, a major maritime Power, \r\nimproving international cooperation in the global \r\noceans is of special importance. We are grateful to the \r\nSecretary-General for the preparation of detailed and \r\nvery informative reports on this issue. \r\nWe take note of the work carried out by the bodies \r\ncreated pursuant to the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea. We would like to congratulate the \r\nInternational Tribunal for the Law of the Sea on the \r\ntwentieth anniversary of its founding and on the success \r\nof the events that have been held to celebrate that \r\nmilestone. The Tribunal approached this anniversary \r\nwith substantial successes. \r\nNext year will mark the thity-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe establishment of the Commission on the Limits of \r\nthe Continental Shelf. Its burden of work grows from \r\nyear to year. We would like to draw the attention of the \r\nmembers of the Assembly to the necessity of ensuring \r\nappropriate conditions of service for the members of \r\nthe Commission, including the long-standing problem \r\nof their medical insurance coverage while in New \r\nYork. Important and technically complex tasks face the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority. \r\nWe are convinced that measures to conserve and \r\nsustainably use the global oceans’ resources must be \r\ncrafted on solid scientific foundations. That is why our \r\ndelegation has consistently championed the regular \r\nprocess of the Global Assessment of the State of the \r\nMarine Environment. The painstaking work of experts \r\nwithin the framework of the first assessment cycle \r\nenabled us to gather and organize a great deal of very \r\nuseful information. We welcome the preparations for \r\nthe second cycle of Global Assessment and expect it to \r\nbe successful. \r\nWe note the rich discussion during the seventeenth \r\nsession of the Informal Consultative Process on the issue \r\nof maritime debris, plastics and microplastics. We view \r\nthis forum as an important platform for the exchange \r\nof views on a broad gamut of issues. It should continue \r\nto be held regularly. Special attention must be devoted \r\nto the issues of the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nmarine biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions. \r\nThe Russian delegation actively participates \r\nin the work of the relevant Preparatory Committee \r\nestablished by the General Assembly. Unfortunately, the \r\nCommittee’s past two sessions have not thus far led to \r\na convergence on positions on key issues, in particular \r\nthe scope and purpose of the future agreement and \r\nthe profit-sharing procedures from the use of marine \r\nbiodiversity. Our priorities here were spelled out in \r\ndetail during the work of the Committee. We would like \r\nto very briefly state the following.\r\nOn the whole, we believe that marine activity should \r\nnot be restricted, unless based on solid scientific and \r\ninternational legal reasons. A possible new document \r\non marine biodiversity should not, in our view, \r\nduplicate or substitute existing mechanisms, including \r\nthe 1995 Agreement on Straddling Fish Stocks and the \r\nsystem of regional fisheries management organizations \r\n(RFMOs) created pursuant to it. The 1995 Agreement is \r\nof great importance for the conservation of fish stocks \r\nand for providing for a genuinely sustainable industry. \r\nWe back further improvement of measures to combat \r\nillegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. It is with \r\nsatisfaction that we note the activity of the International \r\nMaritime Organization in that field, inter alia, in the \r\narea of strengthening real links between f lag States and \r\nits vessels. We urge States to cooperate to create new \r\nRFMOs and enhance the effectiveness of existing ones.\r\nOur delegation backs the adoption by the General \r\nAssembly of draft resolutions A/71/L.26 and A/71/L.24, \r\non oceans and the law of the sea and on sustainable \r\nfishing, respectively. We convey our gratitude to those \r\nthat have worked for draft resolution A/71/L.27, on World \r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n10/20 16-42334\r\nTuna Day. We would like to thank the coordinators of \r\nthe informal consultations and the staff of the Division \r\nof Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, who have so \r\nunswervingly provided expert assistance to delegations \r\nin their work on the aforementioned documents. \r\nIn conclusion, we would like to very briefly respond \r\nto the statement made by the Ukrainian delegation, \r\nwhich has again misused the rostrum of the General \r\nAssembly. We again heard a number of unsubstantiated \r\nclaims that bear no relation to the agenda item being \r\nconsidered. Nevertheless, since we are talking about it \r\nnow, we will clarify and explain yet again that Crimea \r\nis now part of the Russian Federation as a result of \r\nthe expression of free will of the population of the \r\npeninsula. Russia, as a coastal State, has its sovereignty \r\nand rights and exerts its jurisdiction over maritime \r\nareas in accordance with international law. In good \r\nfaith, our country has fulfilled all its obligations under \r\ninternational maritime law when it comes to maritime \r\nareas, which its sovereignty and jurisdiction cover, \r\nincluding off the coast of Crimea.\r\nMrs. Diéguez La O (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nCuba attaches crucial importance to the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea for the maintenance \r\nand strengthening of peace, order and the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of oceans and seas. The Convention is a \r\ntrue milestone in the codification of the international \r\nlaw of the sea and has been ratified by the overwhelming \r\nmajority of Member States. The Convention establishes \r\nan appropriate legal framework, which is universally \r\nrecognized, within which all activities in the oceans and \r\nthe seas should be carried out. It is important that the \r\nintegrity of the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea be preserved and that all of its provisions be \r\nimplemented as a whole. Oceans and the law of the sea \r\naffairs should fall under the supervision of the General \r\nAssembly to guarantee greater coherence in efforts to \r\naddress those issues and to equally equal benefit all \r\nMember States. \r\nCuba has made and continues to make significant \r\nefforts to implement national strategies for the \r\nsustainable development and protection of the marine \r\nenvironment with a view to ensuring coherent, \r\nprogressive and effective implementation of the \r\nConvention’s provisions. The Cuban State has a solid \r\ninstitutional framework and national legislation related \r\nto the law of the sea, and the Government of Cuba is \r\ntaking all steps it can to successfully address crimes \r\nat sea, for example, illicit trafficking in narcotics and \r\npsychotropic substances, illegal human trafficking and \r\npiracy. \r\nCuba reiterates the importance of bolstering \r\ninternational cooperation in the management of marine \r\nresources and in the protection of the oceans and their \r\nbiodiversity, in accordance with the principles of \r\ninternational law, and of safeguarding the due respect \r\nfor the jurisdiction of sovereign States over their \r\nterritorial sea and in the management of resources in \r\nthe exclusive economic zone and on their continental \r\nshelf. We firmly support the commendable work of \r\nthe Commission on the Limits of the Continental Shelf \r\nand urge all Member States to provide their support, \r\nso that the Commission can carry out its work with the \r\nnecessary resources. The Commission must be able to \r\ncarry out its work quickly and effectively, and, at the \r\nsame time, fulfil its established legal requirements. \r\nIt is vitally important to preserve marine \r\nbiodiversity resources for future generations. The \r\nregime by which those resources are exploited will \r\nhave a direct impact on many developing countries, the \r\nmajority of which are small island States. Cuba supports \r\nefforts to achieve a convention on marine biodiversity \r\nbeyond the areas of national jurisdiction. We urge \r\nall members of the international community to work \r\ntogether in the meetings of the Preparatory Committee \r\non that topic, so that we can achieve concrete results by \r\nthe end of next year and so that we can have a binding \r\ninternational instrument on that important issue. \r\nThe continuing rise in sea levels and the increase in \r\nthe effects of climate change in recent decades, given \r\nhumankind’s predatory actions towards nature, threaten \r\nthe territorial integrity of many States, especially small \r\nisland States, some of which are doomed to disappear if \r\nimmediate measures are not taken. The interconnection \r\nof oceanic systems and their close relationship with the \r\ndramatic climate change affecting humankind oblige us \r\nto comply urgently with the established commitments \r\nin both areas. Cuba reiterates its commitment to protect \r\nthe environment and the law of the sea. \r\nWe cannot conclude this statement without \r\nexpressing our appreciation for the work carried out \r\nby the Division for Ocean Affairs and the Law of the \r\nSea for its dedicated work in promoting the law of the \r\nsea and the issues related to oceans. We would also \r\nlike to thank the two coordinators of draft resolutions \r\nA/71/L.24 and A/71/L.26, which we are considering \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 11/20\r\ntoday and which will be adopted with the support of \r\nour delegation. \r\nMr. Sobral Duarte (Brazil): Brazil continues \r\nto attach great importance to the annual debates on \r\noceans and the law of the sea. Those debates reflect \r\nour awareness that the problems of the ocean space \r\nare closely interrelated and need to be considered as \r\na whole and with the broadest possible participation. \r\nThey also attest to the historical significance of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea as \r\nan important contribution to the maintenance of peace, \r\njustice and progress for all of the peoples of the world.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to express our thanks \r\nfor the reports prepared by the Secretary-General \r\n(A/71/74 and A/71/74/Add.1) and the work carried out \r\nby Director Gabriele Goettsche-Wanli and the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, which greatly \r\nhelp to inform and facilitate our debates. Let me also \r\nexpress appreciation for the spirit of cooperation that \r\ncontinues to prevail in the crafting of both of the draft \r\nresolutions before us on oceans and the law of the sea \r\n(A/71/L.26) and sustainable fisheries (A/71/L.24). In \r\nthat regard, we would also like to thank Mr. Thembile \r\nJoyini of South Africa and Mr. Andreas Kravik of \r\nNorway for facilitating the informal consultations on \r\nthose draft resolutions.\r\nThis year’s draft resolution on sustainable fisheries \r\ncontains provisions that address critical issues, such as \r\ncombating illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing \r\nand ghost fishing and the importance of rebuilding \r\nstocks. We welcome the inclusion in the text of several of \r\nthe recommendations made by the Review Conference \r\non the Fish Stocks Agreement, which was chaired by \r\nProfessor Fábio Hazin from Brazil.\r\nBrazil is also a sponsor of the draft resolution \r\non World Tuna Day (A/71/L.27), and we appreciate \r\nthe efforts carried out by Nauru to facilitate the \r\nnegotiations on that text. We reiterate the need for \r\nenhanced cooperation in ensuring the sustainable use of \r\nsuch fisheries and the importance of strengthening the \r\nwork carried out by the Joint Meeting of Tuna Regional \r\nFisheries Management Organizations, in particular \r\nthrough the updating of their legal frameworks and \r\nthe adoption of management measures in line with \r\nscientific advice.\r\nCooperation is also instrumental in the Preparatory \r\nCommittee process dealing with fisheries beyond the \r\nareass of national jurisdition. The engagement of all \r\ndelegations in the debates held during the first and \r\nsecond meetings of the Preparatory Committee are \r\nkey to advancing towards the drafting of substantial \r\nrecommendations to the General Assembly. For Brazil, \r\naccessing and sharing benefits, capacity-building and \r\nthe transfer of marine technology should be at the core \r\nof the envisaged instrument. Those elements are crucial \r\nto realizing one of the main purposes of the Convention, \r\nnamely, that particular attention should be given to the \r\nspecial interests and needs of developing countries.\r\nIn our view, the fair and equitable sharing of the \r\nbenefits that arise from the use of marine genetic \r\nresources beyond national jurisdiction must, therefore, \r\nbe ensured. Due consideration must be given not only \r\nto the development of a mechanism for such sharing \r\nof benefits, but also to accessing those resources. \r\nPromoting and facilitating access, in the natural \r\nenvironment or through data samples, will contribute \r\nto creating sustainable and long-term benefits.\r\nWe continue to strongly support the Regular Process \r\nfor Global Reporting and Assessment of the State of \r\nthe Marine Environment, including Socioeconomic \r\nAspects, which is key to enhancing the scientific \r\nunderstanding of the oceans so as to better protect \r\nthe marine environment. We thank all of the experts \r\nwho have devoted their time to the fulfilment of that \r\nimportant task. We also welcome the discussions held \r\nto improve the process in its second phase and stress \r\nthe importance of ensuring proper funding to achieve \r\nthe goals of the process.\r\nThe Commission on the Limits of the Continental \r\nShelf continues to be faced with several challenges. In \r\naddition to a heavy workload, it now faces the challenge \r\nof ensuring the proper participation of members from \r\ndeveloping countries in the context of the limited \r\nresources in the trust fund.\r\nLast year marked a turning point with respect to \r\nthe oceans, in view of the adoption of Goal 14 of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Brazil \r\nreaffirms its commitment to the full implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda and looks forward to contributing to \r\nthe success of the Fiji Conference to be held next year.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with resolution \r\n51/6, of 24 October 1996, I call on the Secretary-General \r\nof the International Seabed Authority.\r\nMr. Odunton (International Seabed Authority): \r\nThe International Seabed Authority is making its first \r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n12/20 16-42334\r\nintervention at the seventy-first session of the United \r\nNations General Assembly today. In that connection, I \r\nwish to express the Authority’s warmest congratulations \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson on his election as \r\nPresident of this organ. \r\nWith reference to the draft resolutions on the \r\noceans and the law of the sea matters before the General \r\nAssembly, I express my appreciation to Member States \r\nfor deeming it appropriate once again to highlight in the \r\ncontent of those draft resolutions some of the important \r\nand latest work of the International Seabed Authority. I \r\nexpress my thanks and gratitude for the detailed reports \r\nof the Secretary-General (A/71/74 and A/71/74/Add.1), \r\nwhich once again provide comprehensive background \r\ninformation on oceans and law of the sea matters for \r\nour review. The efforts and hard work of the dedicated \r\nDirector and staff of the Division for Ocean Affairs \r\nand the Law of the Sea are much appreciated, and their \r\ncontinued excellent cooperation with the secretariat \r\nof the International Seabed Authority must again \r\nbe commended.\r\nThe draft resolution on oceans and the law of the \r\nsea (A/71/L.26) notes that 28 work plans for exploration \r\nfor the three mineral resources presently identified \r\nby the Authority have been approved by the Council \r\nof the Authority. The Authority has signed three new \r\nexploration contracts so far this year. Two are for \r\npolymetallic nodules, signed with United Kingdom \r\nSeabed Resources Limited on 29 March and with the \r\nCook Islands Investment Corporation on 15 July. The \r\nthird plan of work is for polymetallic sulphides and was \r\nsigned by the Government of India on 26 September.\r\nIt is anticipated that the signing of the two \r\nremaining approved plans of work — submitted by \r\nChina MinMetals Corporation for polymetallic nodules \r\nand by the Government of the Republic of Korea for \r\npolymetallic sulphides — will be signed prior to the \r\ntwenty-third session of the Authority in July 2017. \r\nFollowing the signing of those two contracts, the \r\nnumber of exploration contracts will reach 28, that \r\nis, 17 for polymetallic nodules, six for polymetallic \r\nsulphides and five for cobalt-rich ferromanganese \r\ncrusts. On behalf of the Authority, I express my thanks \r\nand appreciation to those entities and their sponsoring \r\nStates for their commitment to the concept of the \r\ncommon heritage of humankind and their confidence \r\nin the work of the Authority.\r\nThe Council, based on the recommendations of \r\nthe Legal and Technical Commission, approved six \r\napplications for the extension of contracts for exploration \r\nfor polymetallic nodules for another term of five years. \r\nThe concerned contractors were Interoceanmetal Joint \r\nOrganization, Yuzhmorgeologiya, the Government of \r\nthe Republic of Korea, China Ocean Mineral Resources \r\nResearch and Development Association, Deep Ocean \r\nResources Development Co. Ltd. and the French \r\nResearch Institute for the Exploitation of the Sea. An \r\nadditional application for extension was received in \r\nSeptember from the Government of India, which will \r\nbe considered by the Commission at its next meeting, in \r\nFebruary 2017. I would like to encourage contractors to \r\ntake advantage of the extension period of the contracts \r\nto strengthen cooperation in the development of mining \r\ntechnology and pilot tests of deep-sea mining.\r\nMarine environmental protection is an equally \r\nimportant mandate of the Authority, and we have \r\ncontinued to request all contractors to make their \r\nenvironmental data readily and publicly available. The \r\nAuthority will shortly convene three workshops relating \r\nto that environmental work: a workshop to review the \r\nimplementation of an environmental management plan \r\nfor an area of the Pacific Ocean where we have the most \r\nnodule contracts, a scientific workshop together with \r\nmarine-reserve management specialists to determine \r\nthe suitability or need for amendment of the areas of \r\nparticular environmental interest, and a workshop on \r\nimpact reference zones and preservation reference \r\nzones. \r\nI call for the broadest participation of all \r\nconcerned States parties, observers and stakeholders \r\nin those workshops. References to and support for the \r\nAuthority’s role in the promotion of marine scientific \r\nresearch and the protection of the marine environment \r\nin the Area are commended.\r\nFollowing the Authority’s workshops on the \r\ntaxonomic standardization of the macro, micro and \r\nmeiofauna associated with polymetallic nodules in the \r\nArea, I am pleased to report that the contractors with \r\nthe authority to explore for polymetallic nodules in the \r\nArea have begun to utilize those standards in reporting \r\non the fauna in their exploration areas. To my mind, that \r\nis extremely important, since it enables the Authority \r\nto obtain the necessary information to protect the \r\nmarine environment. Such taxonomic standardization \r\nworkshops will be needed for polymetallic sulphides \r\nand cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts as well.\r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 13/20\r\nAt its last session, the Authority took decisive \r\nsteps to adopt its budget, elect members of the Finance \r\nCommittee and elect members of the Legal and \r\nTechnical Commission and members of the Council. \r\nThe Assembly also elected Mr. Michael Lodge of the \r\nUnited Kingdom as the next Secretary-General of the \r\nAuthority. The Assembly also continued its work on the \r\narticle 154 periodic review of the regime of the Area, \r\nan exercise to be completed during the twenty-third \r\nsession, in 2017.\r\nAs part of the Authority’s continued work on \r\nthe formulation of the exploitation framework of \r\nminerals in the Area, I am happy to report that by the \r\ndue date, a total of 45 submissions were received on \r\nthe zero draft of the Exploitation Regulation. Among \r\nthem, eight were submitted by Governments — seven \r\nmembers and one observer — 10 by contractors, one \r\nby an international organization and 19 by institutions \r\nand non-governmental organizations. I was concerned \r\nthat no comments had been received from the African \r\nGroup, the Eastern European Group or the Group of \r\nLatin American and Caribbean States. I would like \r\nto urge developing States to get more involved in the \r\nformulation of the exploitation code, which would \r\nlead to the implementation of the principle of the \r\ncommon heritage of mankind, which promises to bring \r\nsubstantial economic interests to developing States.\r\nEchoing the words of the draft resolution, I wish \r\nto convey the Authority’s appreciation to those who \r\nhave made contributions to the Authority’s Endowment \r\nFund and its Voluntary Trust Fund. The Authority’s \r\nEndowment Fund promotes and encourages the conduct \r\nof collaborative marine scientific research in the \r\ninternational seabed area for the benefit of humankind.\r\nThe General Assembly, as can be gathered from the \r\ntext of the draft resolution, attaches great importance to \r\ncapacity-building. Despite their not being specifically \r\nmentioned, I wish to refer the Assembly to the \r\napproximately 200 training opportunities that will \r\narise in the next five years as a result of contracts for \r\nexploration that have been issued or extended by the \r\nAuthority since 2011. These opportunities include at-sea \r\ntraining, doctorate and master’s degree programmes, \r\nworkshop internships, fellowships and engineering \r\nprogrammes. I have no doubt that those opportunities \r\nwill enhance the building of the capacities of developing \r\nStates in marine science and technology development \r\nand utilization, as well as in the law of the sea and \r\nthe deep-sea mining regime. I urge Member States to \r\nrealize the value of those training opportunities and to \r\nnominate qualified candidates for those forthcoming \r\ntraining places.\r\nIn conclusion, the Authority has continued its full \r\nefforts, within its resources, towards the realization \r\nof the unique regime of the common heritage of \r\nhumankind. Since this is the last time that I address \r\nthis body in my capacity as Secretary-General of the \r\nInternational Seabed Authority, I wish to recall a few \r\nmatters that require our attention. I wish to point out, \r\ninter alia, the need for pilot mining collector tests as \r\nour work progresses in establishing a regime for deep-\r\nseabed mining. Such tests will enable us to ascertain the \r\nfeasibility of mining and, at the same time, provide us \r\nwith the necessary data and information to determine \r\nthe environmental impact of the collectors, which will \r\nbe used by all contractors on the seabed and in the \r\nmarine environment. \r\nThe last time such an effort was undertaken was \r\nin 1981 — it is now 2016 — and while the urgency \r\nof exploitation is frequently mentioned, we have yet \r\nto establish the feasibility of deep-seabed mining. At \r\nsuch a critical juncture, I will once again iterate that it \r\nis essential for all members of the Authority to attend \r\nmeetings, in particular the annual regular sessions of \r\nthe Authority.\r\nAs Secretary-General of the Authority, I have \r\npreviously addressed the General Assembly on this \r\nagenda item seven times. This is my eighth time, \r\nand, as I mentioned before, it will be my last. I wish \r\nto express my thanks to each and every Member State \r\nand observer, contractors and the secretariat of the \r\nAuthority for the support given to me during my term as \r\nleader of the organization. I have always been reassured \r\nby the support of the General Assembly, encouraged \r\nby its cooperation and blessed by its understanding. I \r\nwish the incoming Secretary-General all the very best. \r\nFinally, to the Government and the people of Jamaica, \r\nthe host country for the Authority, I say “big up”.\r\nI wish everyone here a merry Christmas and a \r\nhappy new year. I also support the adoption of the draft \r\nresolutions on this agenda item.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): In \r\naccordance with resolution 51/204, of 17 December \r\n1996, I now call on Mr. Vladimir Golitsyn, President of \r\nthe International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. \r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n14/20 16-42334\r\nMr. Golitsyn (International Tribunal for the \r\nLaw of the Sea): It is an honour for me to address \r\nthe General Assembly on behalf of the International \r\nTribunal for the Law of the Sea during the Assembly’s \r\nconsideration this year of agenda item 73, “Oceans and \r\nthe law of the sea”. Before I begin my statement, let me \r\nfirst convey to the President of the General Assembly \r\nmy congratulations on his election and wish him every \r\nsuccess in the discharge of his responsibilities.\r\nIn my statement, I will first address matters \r\nconcerning the organization of the Tribunal and then \r\nrefer to the Tribunal’s recent judicial work.\r\nFirst of all, I wish to pay tribute to Judge Antonio \r\nCachapuz de Medeiros of Brazil, who passed away on \r\n15 September 2016. Judge Cachapuz de Medeiros had \r\nbecome a Member of the Tribunal on 15 January and, \r\nhad he not died, his term of office would have ended \r\non 30 September 2017. I should like to inform the \r\nAssembly that the election to fill the seat that became \r\nvacant after the death of Judge Cachapuz de Medeiros \r\nwill be held in June 2017, at the next triennial election \r\nof seven members of the Tribunal whose terms of office \r\nwill expire on 30 September 2017. In this regard, a note \r\nverbale was sent by the Registrar of the Tribunal to all \r\nStates parties to the Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\non 4 November 2016. In the coming days, States parties \r\nwill also receive a note verbale calling for nominations \r\nfor the triennial election of judges of the Tribunal.\r\nWith regard to organizational matters, I also wish \r\nto inform the Assembly that on 9 March, the Tribunal \r\nre-elected Mr. Philippe Gautier as Registrar of the \r\nTribunal for a term of office of five years.\r\nAs we are aware, 2016 is a very special year for \r\nthe Tribunal because it commemorates the twentieth \r\nanniversary of its establishment. A number of events \r\nwere organized to mark the occasion. We are particularly \r\ngrateful that the Secretary-General, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, \r\nhonoured the Tribunal by visiting our premises on \r\n7 October 2016 and by meeting the members of the \r\nTribunal and the staff of the Registry.\r\nThe Secretary-General was one of the speakers at a \r\nceremony that took place on that day at the City Hall of \r\nHamburg, Germany. On that occasion, statements were \r\nalso made by the President of the Federal Republic of \r\nGermany, the First Mayor of the Free and Hanseatic \r\nCity of Hamburg and myself. More than 500 guests \r\nattended the event, which was organized with the \r\nsupport of the Federal Republic of Germany and the \r\nFree and Hanseatic Hamburg. To both, I wish to express \r\nour gratitude for their generosity.\r\nThe ceremony was preceded by a two-day \r\ninternational symposium dedicated to the contribution \r\nof the Tribunal to the rule of law. This symposium was \r\nattended by over 150 participants, among them judges \r\nof the Tribunal, the International Court of Justice and \r\nother judicial institutions, academics, lawyers and \r\ncounsel who have appeared before international courts \r\nand tribunals. The symposium was made possible by \r\nthe financial support of the Government of Japan, to \r\nwhich I would like to express my appreciation for its \r\ngenerous contribution.\r\nEarlier this year, the Tribunal arranged another event \r\nin connection with its twentieth anniversary, namely, a \r\nround-table discussion on the role of the Tribunal in the \r\nsettlement of law of the sea disputes. This event was \r\nheld in New York on 23 June 2016, during the Meeting \r\nof States Parties to the United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea, and was well attended. It was \r\norganized with the financial contribution of the Korea \r\nMaritime Institute (KMI), for whose generosity I also \r\nwish to express our gratitude.\r\nLet me now turn to the judicial activity of the \r\nTribunal in the past year. \r\nA few days after 17 December 2015, date of my \r\nlast statement before the General Assembly (see A/70/\r\nPV.69), a new case was submitted to the Tribunal: \r\nPanama v. Italy, also known as the M/V “Norstar” \r\ncase. According to Panama’s application, the dispute \r\nconcerned the arrest and detention of the M/V \r\n“Norstar”, a Panamanian-flagged oil tanker. From \r\n1994 to 1998, the vessel was engaged in supplying \r\ngasoline to mega-yachts in an area described by Panama \r\nas “international waters beyond the territorial sea of \r\nItaly, France and Spain” and described by Italy as “off \r\nthe coasts of France, Italy and Spain”. In 1998, in the \r\ncontext of criminal proceedings, the Public Prosecutor \r\nat the Court of Savona, Italy, issued a Decree of Seizure \r\nagainst the M/V “Norstar” and requested the assistance \r\nof the Spanish authorities for its execution. The vessel \r\nwas then seized by Spanish authorities when it was \r\nanchored in the bay of Palma de Mallorca, Spain.\r\nOn 11 March 2016, Italy raised preliminary \r\nobjections to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and the \r\nadmissibility of the application. Pursuant to the Rules \r\nof the Tribunal, proceedings on the merits of the case \r\nwere suspended, submissions were filed and oral \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 15/20\r\nproceedings took place on the preliminary objections \r\nraised by Italy. On 4 November 2016, the Tribunal \r\ndelivered its judgment on the preliminary objections.\r\nIn support of its claim that the Tribunal had no \r\njurisdiction, Italy invoked the “non-existence of a \r\ndispute concerning the interpretation or application \r\nof the Convention”, the “lack of jurisdiction ratione \r\npersonae” and “the failure by Panama to fulfil its \r\nobligations regarding an exchange of views under \r\narticle 283 of the Convention”. The Tribunal rejected \r\neach of those objections.\r\nIn addressing Italy’s objection based on the \r\nnon-existence of a dispute, the Tribunal examined the \r\ncommunications sent to Italy concerning the detention \r\nof the M/V “Norstar”. It noted that Panama, as the \r\nf lag State of the M/V “Norstar” contested the legality \r\nof the detention under the Convention. It also noted \r\nthat, except for one response issued by Italy, all other \r\ncommunications from Panama remained unanswered. \r\nThe Tribunal then took the view that a communication \r\nsent to Italy and the absence of a response from Italy \r\nindicate that there is a disagreement between the parties \r\non points of law and fact, and concluded that a dispute \r\nexisted between the parties at the time of the filing of \r\nthe application. Examining the question as to whether \r\nthe dispute concerned the interpretation or application \r\nof the Convention, the Tribunal found that among the \r\narticles of the Convention invoked by Panama in its \r\napplication, article 87, on the freedom of the high seas, \r\nand article 300, on good faith and abuse of rights are \r\nrelevant to the case.\r\nWith respect to Italy’s objection based on lack of \r\njurisdiction ratione personae, the Tribunal found that \r\nthe dispute before it concerns the rights and obligations \r\nof Italy and that therefore Italy is the proper respondent \r\nto the claim made by Panama in these proceedings. As \r\nregards Italy’s objection, based on the failure by Panama \r\nto fulfil its obligations regarding an exchange of views \r\nunder article 283 of the Convention, the Tribunal found \r\nthat Panama was justified in assuming that continuing \r\nto attempt to exchange views could not have yielded a \r\npositive result and that it had thus fulfilled its obligation \r\nunder article 283 of the Convention.\r\nThe Tribunal then turned to Italy’s objections \r\nto the admissibility of Panama’s application. Those \r\nobjections, also rejected by the Tribunal, were based on \r\nthe nationality of claims, the non-exhaustion of local \r\nremedies, and on acquiescence, estoppel and extinctive \r\nprescription. With respect to the objection based on \r\nthe nationality of claims, the Tribunal, relying on its \r\nprevious jurisprudence, found that the M/V “Norstar”, \r\nf lying the f lag of Panama, is to be considered a unit, so \r\nthe vessel, its crew and cargo on board, its owner and \r\nevery person involved or interested in its operations are \r\nto be treated as an single entity linked to the f lag State, \r\nirrespective of their nationalities.\r\nWith respect to the objection of Italy based on the \r\nnon-exhaustion of local remedies, the Tribunal noted \r\nthat the right of Panama to enjoy freedom of navigation \r\non the high seas is a right that belongs to Panama under \r\narticle 87 of the Convention, and that a violation of that \r\nright would amount to a direct injury to that country. \r\nThe Tribunal concluded that the claim for damage to \r\nthe persons or entities with an interest in the ship and \r\nits cargo arises from the alleged injury to Panama and \r\nconcluded, accordingly, that the claims in respect of \r\nsuch damages are not subject to the rule of exhaustion \r\nof local remedies.\r\nRegarding acquiescence, the Tribunal held that at \r\nno stage has the conduct of Panama given scope to infer \r\nthat it has abandoned its claim or acquiesced in the lapse \r\nof its claim. As to estoppel, the Tribunal considered that \r\nthe main elements of estoppel have not been fulfilled in \r\nthis case, and, with respect to extinctive prescription, \r\nit found that Panama has not failed to pursue its claim \r\nsince the time when it first made it, so as to render the \r\napplication inadmissible.\r\nHaving rejected all of Italy’s objections to the \r\njurisdiction of the Tribunal and the admissibility of \r\nthe application, the Tribunal, in its judgment, found \r\nthat it had jurisdiction to adjudicate the dispute and \r\ndecided that Panama’s application was admissible. The \r\njudgment of the Tribunal completes the preliminary \r\nobjections stage of proceedings in the M/V “Norstar” \r\ncase. Proceedings on the merits have resumed, and an \r\norder was issued by the President of the Tribunal on \r\n29 November 2016 to fix the time limits for the filing \r\nof the memorial of Panama and the counter-memorial \r\nof Italy.\r\nLet me briefly recall another case that is currently \r\non the Tribunal’s docket, namely, Dispute Concerning \r\nDelimitation of the Maritime Boundary between Ghana \r\nand Côte d’Ivoire in the Atlantic Ocean (Ghana/Côte \r\nd’Ivoire). This case is pending before a Special Chamber \r\nof the Tribunal formed to deal with this dispute. Oral \r\nproceedings in this case will be held in February 2017.\r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n16/20 16-42334\r\nThose two cases, with their different subject \r\nmatter, are a good illustration of the development \r\nthat the Tribunal has seen over the years, specifically, \r\nthat its case law has not only increased but has also \r\ndiversified. In fact, the Tribunal has received a number \r\nof cases dealing with a wide range of matters under the \r\nConvention. The scope of those cases covers maritime \r\ndelimitation, requests for the release of detained vessels, \r\nclaims for damages arising out of the alleged unlawful \r\narrest of vessels, issues concerning responsibilities and \r\nliabilities of States in respect of deep seabed mining as \r\nwell as illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing.\r\nMuch progress has been achieved in this respect \r\nsince the Tribunal’s establishment in 1996. In \r\nparticular, in recent years, cases have been brought \r\nbefore the Tribunal, enabling it to broaden and deepen \r\nits jurisprudence from the viewpoint of both substantial \r\nand procedural law. Therefore, the Tribunal has been \r\nable to further establish itself as a key player in the \r\ndispute-settlement system under the Convention and \r\nto consolidate its position as the central forum for the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes in the field of the law \r\nof the sea.\r\nI also wish to take this opportunity to briefly \r\nupdate the Assembly on the Tribunal’s training \r\nactivities, in particular, the internship programme \r\nand the Nippon fellowship programme. The Tribunal’s \r\ninternship programme is aimed at university students, \r\nand approximately 15 internships of a duration of three \r\nmonths are available each year. Since the establishment \r\nof the programme in 1997, 326 interns from 94 States \r\nhave benefited from this opportunity. \r\nI wish to highlight that the Tribunal’s internship \r\nprogramme also offers scholarships to participants \r\nfrom developing countries in order to support them \r\nfinancially during their stay in Hamburg. For that \r\npurpose, the Tribunal has set up a trust fund. In the \r\npast, grants have been made to this fund by the \r\nKorea Maritime Institute and the China Institute of \r\nInternational Studies. In 2016, a further grant was made \r\nby KMI, and I wish to express our sincere appreciation \r\nfor the Institute’s valued support.\r\nThe Nippon fellowship programme is a capacity-\r\nbuilding and training programme designed to provide \r\njunior to mid-level Government officials and researchers \r\nwith advanced legal training in international dispute \r\nsettlement in the law of the sea. In 2016, the participants \r\ncame from Cameroon, Cambodia, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo, Portugal and Thailand. To \r\nsum up, since the establishment of the programme in \r\n2007, 65 fellows from 54 countries have participated in \r\nthis programme. I should like to express my gratitude \r\nto the Nippon Foundation for its generous funding of \r\nthe programme.\r\nI should also like to take this opportunity to reiterate \r\nthe concluding part of the statement that I made at the \r\nceremony marking the twentieth anniversary of the \r\nTribunal: \r\n“Building on the experience of the last 20 years, \r\nthe Tribunal stands ready to meet the challenges \r\nof the future. We, the Judges of the Tribunal, are \r\nready to serve the international community and the \r\nStates parties to the Convention for the settlement \r\nof their disputes related to the implementation and \r\napplication of the Convention”. \r\nLet me also express my appreciation to the Division \r\nfor Ocean Affairs and the Law of the Sea of the Office of \r\nLegal Affairs for its continued cooperation and support \r\nfor the Tribunal. I wish the General Assembly every \r\nsuccess in its important deliberations at the seventy-\r\nfirst session.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker in the debate on agenda item 73 \r\nand its sub-items (a) and (b).\r\nBefore proceeding further, I would like to remind \r\nmembers that action on draft resolution A/71/L.26 is \r\npostponed to a later date to allow time for the review \r\nof its programme budget implications by the Fifth \r\nCommittee. \r\nThe Assembly will take action on the draft \r\nresolution as soon as the report of the Fifth Committee \r\non its programme budget implications is available.\r\nThe Assembly will now take action on draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.24, entitled “Sustainable fisheries, \r\nincluding through the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks, and related instruments”. \r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMs. Ochalik (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 17/20\r\nthat since the submission of the draft resolution and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in the draft \r\ndocument, the following countries have become \r\nsponsors of A/71/L.24: the Bahamas, Canada, the \r\nCzech Republic, Greece, Indonesia, Jamaica, Latvia, \r\nLuxembourg, Maldives, Monaco, Nauru, Poland, \r\nPortugal, Spain, Sweden, Ukraine and the United \r\nStates of America.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nadopt draft resolution A/71/L.24?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.24 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/123).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now take action on draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.27, entitled “World Tuna Day”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMs. Ochalik (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to \r\nannounce that since the submission of the draft \r\nresolution and in addition to those delegations listed \r\nin the draft document, the following countries have \r\nbecome sponsors of A/71/L.27: Argentina, Bhutan, \r\nBosnia and Herzegovina, Dominica, Ecuador, Greece, \r\nGuatemala, Kazakhstan, Madagascar, Mauritius, \r\nMexico, Mongolia, Portugal, the Russian Federation, \r\nSaint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nTajikistan and Viet Nam.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): May I \r\ntake it that it is the wish of the General Assembly to \r\nadopt draft resolution A/71/L.27?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.27 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/124).\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): Before \r\ngiving the f loor to delegations that wish to explain their \r\nposition on the resolutions just adopted, may I remind \r\nAssembly members that explanations of position are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes and should be made by delegations \r\nfrom their seats.\r\nMr. Medina Mejías (Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela) (spoke in Spanish): We take this opportunity \r\nto extend our sincere thanks to the representative of \r\nthe Norwegian delegation, Mr. Andreas Motzfeldt \r\nKravik, for having facilitated the negotiation process \r\non the text of resolution 71/123, entitled “Sustainable \r\nfisheries, including through the 1995 Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish \r\nStocks, and related instruments”. \r\nWe also thank the Director of the Division of \r\nOcean Affairs and the Law of the Sea, Ms. Gabriele \r\nGoettsche-Wanli, and her team, and United Nations \r\nLegal Counsel Mr. Miguel de Serpa Soares for \r\nsupporting the delegations through the Office of \r\nLegal Affairs.\r\nThe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela reiterates \r\nits commitment to sustainable fishing, as evidenced \r\nby its implementation of the principles of the Code of \r\nConduct for Responsible Fisheries, issued by the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, \r\nand chapter 17 of Agenda 21, approved by the United \r\nNations Conference on Environment and Development \r\nin 1992. My country is also party to several \r\ninternational instruments that call for the preservation \r\nand management of fishing. \r\nIt has been Venezuela’s consistent position in \r\nvarious international forums that the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) should not \r\nbe considered the only legal framework that governs all \r\nactivities carried out in the seas and oceans, as there are \r\nother applicable international instruments — including \r\nthe Geneva Conventions — that together with UNCLOS \r\nmake up the body of law known as the law of the sea. In \r\nthat regard, it has been our consistent and long-standing \r\nposition to object to the possibility of the Convention \r\nbeing invoked as conventional law or customary \r\ninternational law unless the Bolivarian Republic of \r\nVenezuela expressly recognizes it as such, in future, \r\nthrough its incorporation into its national legislation.\r\nThe Venezuelan delegation has stated on numerous \r\noccasions that, in the view of the Venezuelan State, \r\nUNCLOS does not, despite its universal nature, enjoy \r\nuniversal participation. To date, UNCLOS has only \r\n164 States parties, unlike many other multilateral \r\ninstruments, such as the Convention on Biological \r\nDiversity, which currently has 193 States parties.\r\nVenezuela is not party to the the Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management of \r\nStraddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks, \r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n18/20 16-42334\r\nnor are the norms of those international instruments \r\napplicable to Venezuela under customary international \r\nlaw, unless it has been explicitly otherwise indicated \r\nby Venezuela. They may be recognized in future \r\nthrough their incorporation into domestic legislation. \r\nThe reasons that have prevented our ratification of \r\nthose instruments, UNCLOS in particular, continue to \r\nbe pertinent today.\r\nAlthough our country is not party to the 1995 \r\nAgreement on Sustainable Fisheries, the fisheries \r\nand agriculture sectors are a priority in our national \r\ndevelopment plans. That is evident in our Programa de la \r\nPatria for 2013-2019. That national programme includes \r\nobjectives such as promoting fisheries development \r\nby modernizing our fishing f leets and our maritime \r\nand river fisheries infrastructures. That national \r\ndevelopment plan is complemented by a broad set of \r\nregulations through which we have been able to set up \r\nprogrammes focusing on the conservation, protection \r\nand management of marine biological resources and on \r\npromoting responsible and sustainable management.\r\nWe have focused on relevant biological and \r\neconomic aspects, as well as on food security and the \r\nrelevant social, cultural, environmental and commercial \r\nissues. The Venezuelan law on fisheries prohibits \r\nbottom trawling and establishes a sanctions regime for \r\nthe failure to respect conservation and management \r\nmeasures applicable to fisheries. It includes oversight \r\nmeasures for those vessels f lying the national f lag that \r\nengage in fisheries activities, as well an inspection \r\nand monitoring system for operations on the high seas, \r\nwhich submits the relevant information to the body \r\ntasked with fisheries management. That allows us to \r\nknow exactly in which geographical area a fisheries \r\noperation is being carried out and to ensure compliance \r\nwith the regulations on the management of resources \r\nestablished in the law.\r\nIt is also important to highlight that Venezuela is \r\nmaking national contributions to designing a legally \r\nbinding instrument on port State control that focuses \r\non the prevention, deterrence and elimination of illegal, \r\nunreported and unregulated fishing. We made those \r\ncontributions during technical consultations held in the \r\nframework of the Food and Agriculture Organization of \r\nthe United Nations.\r\nIn the interest of consensus, my delegation did not \r\nstand in the way of the adoption of resolution 71/123, on \r\nsustainable fisheries. Nevertheless, Venezuela wishes \r\nto make explicit its reservations with regard to the \r\ncontent of the resolution, given the fact that it is not a \r\nState party to UNCLOS nor to the Agreement for the \r\nImplementation of the Provisions of the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea of 10 December \r\n1982 relating to the Conservation and Management \r\nof Straddling Fish Stocks and Highly Migratory \r\nFish Stocks.\r\nAlthough the text of the resolution contains some \r\npositive aspects, we would caution that the text also \r\ncontains elements that caused Venezuela in the past to \r\nexpress reservations to the outcome document of the \r\nUnited Nations Conference on Sustainable Development \r\nin resolution 66/288. Those reservations were in relation \r\nto issues regarding marine biodiversity. In addition, our \r\ncountry, for the same reasons, expressed reservations \r\nto target 14C of the Sustainable Development Goals in \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nWe believe that future updates to the terms of \r\nUNCLOS should be considered, given that there are new \r\nsituations for which the current approach is inadequate \r\nand, in some cases, counterproductive, which therefore \r\nprevents the universal application of the Convention. \r\nThat situation has been affecting the development of \r\na regime that should be addressing the most important \r\ncontemporary issues regarding the oceans and seas in a \r\nbalanced, equitable and inclusive manner. The reasons \r\nthat prevented the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela \r\nfrom becoming party to such instruments in the past \r\nstill persist today.\r\nMr. Erciyes (Turkey): Turkey joined the consensus \r\non resolution 71/123, on sustainable fisheries, as Turkey \r\nis fully committed to the conservation, management and \r\nsustainable use of marine living resources and attaches \r\ngreat importance to regional cooperation to that end. \r\nHowever, Turkey disassociates itself from the references \r\nmade in the resolution to international instruments to \r\nwhich it is not party. Those references should therefore \r\nnot be interpreted as a change in the legal position of \r\nTurkey with regards to those instruments.\r\nMr. Cuéllar Torres (Colombia) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nThe Colombian delegation expresses its sincere thanks \r\nto Mr. Andreas Kravik of Norway for his tireless work \r\nas the coordinator of resolution 71/123, on sustainable \r\nfisheries, in conducting in-depth and transparent \r\ndiscussions in a constructive spirit that reflected \r\nthe diversity of all the States that participated in \r\nthe consultations.\r\n07/12/2016 A/71/PV.55\r\n16-42334 19/20\r\nColombia recognizes the valuable contribution \r\nmade by the resolutions on sustainable fisheries. The \r\nconstructive spirit that guides Colombia, given the \r\nneed to ensure sustainable fishing, is based on its firm \r\nconviction that all nations have a commitment to the \r\nprotection of the sea and its resource in the interest of \r\nensuring a sustainable future, for the world depends on \r\nit. Colombia attaches great institutional significance \r\nto marine-coastal matters and has a unifying vision \r\nin which the sea, the coast and its resources are \r\nfundamental elements of the country’s governance.\r\nColombia reaffirms its commitment to the \r\ndevelopment and sustainable management of fishery \r\nresources in the interest of constructing not only a \r\nsustainable country but also sustainable fisheries on a \r\nglobal scale and ensuring access to fishing resources \r\nfor future generations. It is in fulfilment of those \r\ncommitments that Colombia supported the resolution \r\nwith determination and joined the consensus for \r\nits adoption.\r\nHowever, Colombia wishes respectfully to state \r\nthat the resolution was formulated on the basis of the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea of \r\nDecember 10, 1982, and to remind the Assembly that \r\nColombia has not ratified that legal instrument, and its \r\nprovisions should therefore not apply to, and cannot \r\nbe enforced in, Colombia, with the exception of those \r\nprovisions that Colombia has expressly accepted.\r\nThe Republic of Colombia wishes therefore to state \r\nthat the resolution, along with Colombia’s participation \r\nin the process of its adoption, should not be considered \r\nor interpreted in a way that implies the express or tacit \r\nacceptance by the Colombian State of the provisions \r\ncontained in the United Nations Convention on the Law \r\nof the Sea. Colombia does not consider the Convention \r\nto be the only standard framework for regulating \r\nactivities in the oceans. My delegation would like to \r\nreiterate that Colombia carries out activities in the \r\nmarine environment in strict compliance with the \r\ninternational commitments that it has expressly adopted \r\nor accepted. For those reasons, Colombia expresses its \r\nreservation regarding any mention of the Convention \r\nwithin the resolution, as we are not considered parties \r\nto the Convention nor are we bound by its contents. I \r\nrequest that this explanation of our position be included \r\nin the record of this meeting.\r\nMs. Gandini (Argentina) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nArgentina joined in the General Assembly’s consensus \r\nin favour of resolution 71/123, on sustainable fisheries. \r\nHowever, we wish to inform the Assembly once again \r\nthat none of the recommendations included in the \r\nresolution can be interpreted to mean that the provisions \r\nof the 1995 Agreement for the Implementation of the \r\nProvisions of the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea of 10 December 1982 relating to the \r\nConservation and Management of Straddling Fish \r\nStocks and Highly Migratory Fish Stocks and related \r\ninstruments can be considered to be binding on \r\nStates that have not clearly expressed their consent or \r\ncommitment to that Agreement.\r\nThe resolution that we have just adopted contains \r\nparagraphs concerning the implementation of the \r\nrecommendations of the Review Conference on \r\nthe Agreement. Argentina reiterates that those \r\nrecommendations must be not considered enforceable, \r\nbut rather as mere recommendations to States non-parties \r\nto the Agreement. At the same time, Argentina wishes \r\nto note that current international law does not authorize \r\nregional management organizations and arrangements \r\non fisheries or their member States to take any measure \r\nwith respect to vessels whose f lag State is not a member \r\nof such an organization or arrangement or that have not \r\nexplicitly consented to the application of such measures \r\nto vessels f lying the f lags of non-members. Nothing in \r\nthe resolutions of the General Assembly, including the \r\none that we have just adopted, can be interpreted to be \r\ncontrary to that conclusion.\r\nMoreover, I recall once again that, in the \r\nimplementation of conservation measures, the conduct \r\nof scientific research or the undertaking of any other \r\nactivity recommended in resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly, particularly resolution 61/105 and other \r\nrelevant resolutions, and the legal framework provided \r\nby the International Law of the Sea as reflected in the \r\nConvention, including in paragraph 13 of article 77, \r\nmust be strictly respected. The implementation of the \r\nresolutions cannot, therefore, be used as a precondition \r\nor justification for ignoring or violating the rights \r\nestablished by the Convention. Nothing in resolution \r\n61/105 or other related resolutions of the General \r\nAssembly prejudices the sovereign rights of coastal \r\nStates over their continental shelf or the exercise of \r\nthe jurisdiction of coastal States with respect to their \r\ncontinental shelf under international law.\r\nParagraph 176 of the resolution adopted today \r\ncontains a pertinent reminder of that concept, which \r\nhas already been reflected in resolution 64/72 and \r\nsubsequent resolutions. In that same vein, paragraph \r\n177 recognizes the adoption by coastal States, including \r\nA/71/PV.55 07/12/2016\r\n20/20 16-42334\r\nArgentina, of measures to recognize the impact of \r\nbottom fishing on vulnerable marine ecosystems on the \r\nentirety of their continental shelves. It also recognizes \r\ntheir efforts to ensure compliance with those measures. \r\nI would like to request that Argentina’s explanation of \r\nits position be reflected in the record of this meeting.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): May \r\nI take it that the Assembly wishes to conclude its \r\nconsideration of sub-item (b) of agenda item 73?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe meeting rose at 5.05 p.m.\r\n"
