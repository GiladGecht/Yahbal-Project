"United Nations A/71/PV.56\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n56th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 8 December 2016, 10 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 10.15 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 69\r\nStrengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nand disaster relief assistance of the United Nations, \r\nincluding special economic assistance\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/395)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.34)\r\nDraft amendments (A/71/L.36 and A/71/L.37)\r\n(a) Strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations\r\nReports of the Secretary-General (A/71/82, \r\nA/71/329, A/71/336 and A/71/353)\r\nDraft resolutions (A/71/L.32 and A/71/L.33)\r\n(b) Assistance to the Palestinian people\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/87)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.31)\r\n(c) Special economic assistance to individual \r\ncountries or regions\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/620)\r\n(d) Strengthening of international cooperation \r\nand coordination of efforts to study, mitigate \r\nand minimize the consequences of the \r\nChernobyl disaster\r\nReport of the Secretary-General (A/71/411)\r\nDraft resolution (A/71/L.28)\r\nThe President: This year marks the twenty-fifth \r\nanniversary of the adoption of resolution 46/182, entitled \r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of humanitarian \r\nemergency assistance of the United Nations”. Its adoption \r\nwas a landmark development for the United Nations in \r\nestablishing guiding principles for the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian assistance and in establishing the United \r\nNations humanitarian architecture.\r\nWhile this is a moment for commemoration, \r\nit regrettably takes place at a time of escalating \r\nhumanitarian emergencies and needs. Ongoing conflicts \r\nand the devastating impacts of climate change, extreme \r\nweather and natural disasters are compounding and \r\nleading to the suffering of millions of people. The loss \r\nof life, homes, infrastructure, livelihoods and food \r\nsecurity are having devastating consequences. Across \r\nour world, 128.6 million people are affected by conflict, \r\nviolence and disaster, with almost 93 million people in \r\nneed of protection and humanitarian assistance. Indeed, \r\nas we meet, the United Nations and its partners are \r\nlaunching the largest appeal in history for humanitarian \r\nfunding, seeking $22.2 billion in 2017 to meet the urgent \r\nhumanitarian needs of people across the globe. I would \r\nurge all Member States to contribute to that appeal.\r\nAs we look to address the enormous scale of the \r\nchallenge facing us, we must strive to find new ways to \r\nsustain peace, resolve conflicts, combat climate change, \r\nbetter manage migrant and refugee f lows and respond \r\nto escalating humanitarian needs. In that context, it \r\nis critical that the international community engage in \r\nmulti-year planning, enhance coordination between the \r\nUnited Nations and other humanitarian actors on the \r\nground, and make the best use of all available tools and \r\nresources at its disposal.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-42340 (E)\r\n*1642340*\r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n2/26 16-42340\r\nFundamental to that effort is the recognition of the \r\ninterlinkages between sustainable development, peace \r\nand security, human rights and humanitarian action, as \r\nwell as finding new ways to bring these strands together \r\nand develop solutions. To that end, I will convene a \r\nhigh-level dialogue, entitled “Building Sustainable \r\nPeace for All: Synergies between the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and Sustaining Peace”. That \r\nmeeting will be held on 24 January 2017.\r\nThe implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change and the Sendai Framework for \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 must, of course, be \r\nprioritized for urgent action. At the same time, the New \r\nYork Declaration for Refugees and Migrants and the \r\ncommitments made at the World Humanitarian Summit \r\nmust be seen as complementary to the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) and implemented without \r\ndelay. Long-term solutions are needed to break the \r\ncycles of recurrent crises and conflicts that the world \r\nis currently caught in. If the SDGs are implemented \r\nurgently, effectively and at scale, they will eradicate \r\nextreme poverty, advance gender equality and protect \r\nour natural environment. Their implementation will \r\nmeet humanitarian needs, as they will build peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies and combat climate change.\r\nAt present, more than 65 million people have been \r\nforcibly displaced as a result of armed conflict and \r\npersecution. Flagrant attacks against civilians, schools, \r\nhospitals and humanitarian and medical personnel \r\ncontinue, in violation of international human rights and \r\nhumanitarian law. I strongly condemn such attacks. \r\nPolitical solutions for those crises must urgently \r\nbe found.\r\nWe must also ramp up our action to address \r\nclimate change. The science on climate change is \r\nunequivocal. We are currently on a pathway to a 3°C \r\nto 4°C increase, and the adverse impacts of that reality \r\nare undermining the ability of countries to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. The consequences \r\nfor humankind will be catastrophic if the current \r\ntrajectory is not radically altered. As we all know, \r\nclimate change is increasing the frequency and severity \r\nof natural disasters, including droughts, storms and \r\nf loods with devastating consequences. Developing \r\ncountries, particularly the least developed countries \r\nand the small island developing countries, are acutely \r\nvulnerable to the resulting human and economic \r\nloss. It is estimated that in 2015, 19.2 million people \r\nwere displaced by disasters associated with natural \r\nhazards. To put it simply, combating climate change is \r\na humanitarian imperative.\r\nIt is only by working together that we will be able \r\nto improve humanitarian responses, reduce underlying \r\ncauses, build resilience and ensure that development \r\ngains reach our most vulnerable people — the millions \r\nof people relying on us for humanitarian assistance. \r\nCollective responsibility and action are needed. I count \r\non all member States to support those efforts.\r\nI now give the f loor to the Deputy Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of Belarus, who will introduce draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.28.\r\nMr. Rybakov (Belarus) (spoke in Russian): It \r\nis a great honour for me to present draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.28, entitled the “Persistent legacy of the \r\nChernobyl disaster”. I should like, from the very bottom \r\nof my heart, to thank all delegations that have actively \r\nand constructively contributed to the consultations on \r\nthe text of the draft resolution. I am pleased to note \r\nthe positive nature of the draft resolution, reflecting the \r\nmany well-wishers. We would particularly like to thank \r\nthose countries sponsoring the draft resolution for their \r\nvaluable support.\r\nIn introducing the draft resolution, we confirm the \r\nimportance of international cooperation on Chernobyl \r\nunder United Nations auspices, the aim of which is to \r\nsurmount the long-term repercussions of the disaster. \r\nWe also reaffirm the unique and leading role played \r\nby the United Nations in the coordination of efforts to \r\nmeet the needs of the people in the territories affected. \r\nIt has been 30 years since that enormous nuclear \r\ndisaster occurred in the Chernobyl nuclear-power plant. \r\nHowever, millions of people in the affected regions of \r\nBelarus, Ukraine and Russia continue to reside in the \r\ncontaminated areas. The area of radioactive fallout \r\ncovers nearly one quarter of the territory of Belarus, \r\nwhere 20 per cent of our population resides.\r\nSurmounting the repercussions of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster has become a top priority for our Government \r\nin Belarus. Notwithstanding the great progress in \r\nrecovering affected regions, much remains to be done. \r\nThe legacy of Chernobyl will remain relevant for the \r\naffected regions in the long term. This year, we have \r\ndrafted a focused and more concise document, as \r\ncompared with previous resolutions on the topic.\r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 3/26\r\nThe thirtieth anniversary of the Chernobyl disaster \r\ncoincided with the completion of the implementation of \r\nthe United Nations action plan on Chernobyl to 2016. \r\nTherefore, our draft resolution emphasizes the need \r\nto continue Chernobyl-oriented cooperation under \r\nUnited Nations auspices after 2016, so as to achieve \r\nsustainable development in the regions affected through \r\npartnerships, innovation and investment.\r\nThe current draft resolution builds upon resolution \r\n68/99 and the Minsk agreements, adopted at the \r\ninternational conference entitled “Chernobyl 30 years \r\nlater: from an emergency to a revival and sustainable \r\nsocial and economic development of affected territories”, \r\nheld on 25 April in Minsk. We note with gratitude the \r\ncontribution of the international community, including \r\nthe United Nations, to the recovery and development \r\nof the affected regions. A major role has, of course, \r\nbeen played by the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, which serves as the coordinator for all \r\nUnited Nations bodies and organizations engaged in the \r\nChernobyl efforts.\r\nGiven the completion of the 2006-2016 Decade of \r\nRecovery and Sustainable Development of the Affected \r\nRegions, as proclaimed by the General Assembly \r\n(resolution 62/9), draft resolution A/71/L.28 calls on \r\nthe United Nations Development Programme and the \r\nInter-Agency Task Force on Chernobyl to continue to \r\njoin the countries affected, in consultation with Member \r\nStates, in drafting clear parameters for United Nations \r\nengagement in efforts for the recovery of the affected \r\nterritories. The draft resolution underscores the need \r\nto monitor the situation in such regions. In order to \r\nassess the effectiveness of international assistance, \r\nthe draft resolution acknowledges the need to enhance \r\nnetworking among specialized national scientific \r\ninstitutions aimed at studying the long-term medical, \r\nradiological, radiobiological and other consequences of \r\nthe Chernobyl disaster.\r\nBelarus has amassed unique experience in the work \r\ndirected towards the recovery of the affected regions \r\nand the revival of socioeconomic activity with a view to \r\nsetting the stage for ensuring safe residences for people \r\nin the affected regions. We should like to stress that \r\nwe stand ready to safeguard and share the experience \r\nthat we have gained in surmounting the repercussions \r\nof that man-made disaster, so as to ensure subsequent \r\nsustainable development.\r\nA key symbolic component of the draft resolution is \r\nthe proclamation of 26 April as International Chernobyl \r\nDisaster Remembrance Day. I hope that the Assembly \r\nrecalls the fact that, during the commemorative \r\nmeeting of the General Assembly marking the thirtieth \r\nanniversary of the Chernobyl disaster, Adi Roche, \r\nthe well-known Irish political and social activist \r\nfor Chernobyl children, spoke from this rostrum on \r\nbehalf of the Belarus delegation (see A/70/PV.92). She \r\ndedicated 30 years of her life to helping children in \r\ncountries far from her own. The credit for such a noble \r\nidea lies with her — the idea of proclaiming 26 April \r\nInternational Chernobyl Remembrance Day. We are \r\nvery pleased that the idea secured support in the hearts \r\nof our partners.\r\nWe view the adoption by the General Assembly of \r\nthe draft resolution on Chernobyl as a confirmation of \r\nthe steadfast solidarity of the international community \r\nwith the efforts of the countries affected, as well as \r\na willingness to continue to ensure that the issue of \r\nChernobyl receives due attention. We fully believe \r\nthat such an important draft resolution will again be \r\nadopted by consensus.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of \r\nSlovakia to introduce draft resolution A/71/L.34.\r\nMr. Ružička (Slovakia): I have the honour to \r\nintroduce, on behalf of the European Union and its \r\nmember States, the draft resolution entitled “Safety \r\nand security of humanitarian personnel and protection \r\nof United Nations personnel”, contained in document \r\nA/71/L.34.\r\nIn 2015, 109 aid workers were killed, 110 injured \r\nand 68 kidnapped in the exercise of their humanitarian \r\nwork. While those figures are somewhat lower than the \r\nall-time high reached in 2013, they are still unacceptably \r\nhigh. The operating environment for humanitarian \r\npersonnel and United Nations personnel has become \r\nsignificantly more dangerous, as demonstrated by the \r\nthreefold increase in the number of direct attacks against \r\nUnited Nations premises and vehicles. However, the \r\nfortunately diminished impact of such attacks against \r\nthe United Nations also illustrates the progress made in \r\nthe security management system of the United Nations.\r\nIn this year’s draft resolution, we continue to \r\nrecognize the diverse and multifaceted threats and \r\ndifferent exposure that female and male humanitarian \r\npersonnel, including non-governmental organizations, \r\nmedical personnel and United Nations and associated \r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n4/26 16-42340\r\npersonnel, face in the overall deteriorating global \r\nsecurity environment, and commend their courage \r\nfor continuing to operate in such environments, often \r\nat great personal risk. We also strongly reaffirm that \r\nall deliberate attacks against civilians, including \r\nhumanitarian or United Nations personnel, as well as \r\nattacks or repressions inflicted on medical personnel \r\nor their facilities, are clear violations of international \r\nhumanitarian law, and that the perpetrators must be \r\nheld accountable. This year’s draft resolution notably \r\nemphasizes the need to promptly, fully and effectively \r\ninvestigate such attacks.\r\nLast but not least, through the draft resolution, we \r\ncommend and encourage the continued improvements \r\nin and professionalization of the United Nations \r\nsecurity management system. We commend the work \r\nof the United Nations Department for Safety and \r\nSecurity under the guidance of Under-Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Peter Drennan, and welcome the \r\nintegration of all security personnel of the Secretariat \r\nunder his leadership. The draft resolution reiterates \r\nthe strong mandate and additional guidance from the \r\nGeneral Assembly for the essential work performed \r\nby Department for Safety and Security and the United \r\nNations Security Management System more broadly.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nfirmly believe that it is our duty to acknowledge the \r\ncommitment of humanitarian and United Nations and \r\nassociated personnel and to support their work and do \r\neverything in our power to further enhance their safety \r\nand security.\r\nI wish to warmly thank the many delegations \r\nthat took part in the consultations, particularly those \r\nsponsoring the draft resolution, for their constructive \r\nengagement with a view to agreeing on a text that \r\ndemonstrates our shared concern regarding the safety \r\nand security of humanitarian and United Nations \r\npersonnel. I would also like to thank the valuable \r\nsupport of the Department of Safety and Security and \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, \r\nwhich informed our discussions.\r\nThe humanitarian draft resolution has been and \r\nshould remain genuinely consensual as a testimony to \r\nour shared humanity. We owe that to the people risking \r\ntheir lives on a daily basis in order to save the lives \r\nof others. They need the collective, unequivocal and \r\nunqualified support of the entire General Assembly.\r\nThe President: I call on the representative of \r\nSweden to introduce draft resolution A/71/L.32.\r\nMr. Skoog (Sweden): It is my great pleasure \r\nto introduce to the General Assembly the draft \r\nresolution entitled “Strengthening of the coordination \r\nof emergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations”, contained in document A/71/L.32.\r\nThis year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of \r\nthe landmark resolution 46/182. Sweden has facilitated \r\nthe negotiations on later versions of that resolution ever \r\nsince its adoption. When the original resolution was \r\nadopted 25 years ago ,at 1.30 a.m. on 19 December 1991, \r\nspontaneous applause broke out in the Hall. People \r\nwere seized by a sense of solidarity and of embarking \r\non a new, common endeavour for the greater good of \r\nthe world’s most vulnerable. Such is the power and \r\npotential of the United Nations at its best.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of an unprecedented global \r\nhumanitarian crisis, we should try to re-enact the same \r\nkind of urgency today as we present an updated and \r\nimproved incarnation of resolution 46/182. Right now \r\nis also the time to remember that the goal of our efforts \r\nremains the same as it was on that day 25 years ago, \r\nnamelt, to effectively come to the aid of desperate fellow \r\nmen and women affected by crisis. That is why the \r\nconcept of consensus and of a collaborative approach \r\nthat goes above and beyond narrow national interests is \r\nso critical when it comes to humanitarian affairs.\r\nThe annual adoption by the General Assembly of \r\nthe omnibus humanitarian resolution reaffirms the \r\nunique leadership role played by the United Nations in \r\ncoordinating and responding to global humanitarian \r\nneeds. Its adoption by consensus sends an important \r\nmessage of our collective dedication to respond \r\nto humanitarian needs and uphold international \r\nhumanitarian law. This year’s draft resolution has a \r\nnumber of significant improvements, reinforcements \r\nand adaptations to the humanitarian realities of today. \r\nThe end result is an ever-improved policy platform \r\nfor global humanitarian action and assistance. Let me \r\nmention three significant developments.\r\nFirst, this year’s draft resolution highlights the \r\ndifficult situation faced by the record number of people \r\nwho have been forcibly displaced by conflict and \r\ndisasters and the urgent need to ensure protection and \r\ndurable solutions for such populations.\r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 5/26\r\nSecondly, we have further strengthened the \r\nframework to prevent, respond to and prosecute acts \r\nof sexual and gender-based violence in humanitarian \r\nemergencies. We have also reinforced the role of women \r\nin humanitarian action, highlighting the importance \r\nof including women in decision-making processes at \r\nall levels.\r\nThirdly, this year’s draft resolution provides a \r\nstronger platform for humanitarian reform, humanitarian \r\nfinancing and collaborative efficiencies, highlighting \r\nthe responsibilities of both donors and humanitarian \r\nactors. This year’s draft resolution also reflects the \r\ninterdependency and criticality of partnerships among \r\nthe various aspects of humanitarian aid. It highlights \r\nthe importance of local actors, national efforts and \r\nlinkages with the development sector aimed at meeting \r\nlong-term humanitarian needs.\r\nBy these and other improvements we have taken \r\na collective step towards a stronger, more effective \r\nand more inclusive humanitarian response system. \r\nWe now count on the United Nations and its Member \r\nStates — that is us — to implement those important \r\nchanges. I am pleased to note that the number of \r\nsponsors has increased significantly compared with \r\nprevious years, with strong cross-regional support \r\nfor the important issues and objectives that we have \r\noutlined in the omnibus draft resolution.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to warmly \r\nthank and congratulate delegations for their active \r\nand constructive engagement with this year’s \r\ndraft resolution and for supporting it through their \r\nsponsorship. I want to express special thanks to all of \r\nthe humanitarian experts in the Hall for their excellent \r\nwork, and I address a special word of gratitude to my \r\nown expert, Counsellor Ola Sohlström, for his excellent \r\ncoordination of this draft resolution. We look forward \r\nto its formal adoption by consensus later on.\r\nThe strengthened draft resolution that I am proud to \r\npresent here today is a result of the common dedication \r\nof many active Member States, small and large, of \r\ncountries providing humanitarian assistance and those \r\nreceiving it, of countries prone to disasters and those \r\nwith lessons on how to avoid them, of countries that \r\nhave suffered crises that have forced parts of their \r\npopulation to f lee and countries generously hosting \r\nthose who need shelter.\r\nSuch broad and diverse ownership demonstrates \r\nthe truly global nature of humanitarian solidarity. It is \r\nthrough our collective action and continued support for \r\nthose reforms that we will succeed in improving the \r\nglobal humanitarian system and ultimately provide \r\nrelief to those who need it the most.\r\nThe President: I now call on the representative of \r\nThailand to introduce draft resolution A/71/L.33.\r\nMs. Jariyadham (Thailand): On behalf of the \r\nGroup of 77 and China, I have the distinct honour to \r\nintroduce to the General Assembly the draft resolution \r\nentitled “International cooperation on humanitarian \r\nassistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief \r\nto development”, as contained in document A/71/L.33.\r\nAs we introduce the draft resolution again this \r\nyear, the Group of 77 and China continue to reaffirm \r\nthe importance of international cooperation in \r\nproviding assistance to countries and peoples affected \r\nby natural disasters, in accordance with resolution \r\n46/182 and the guiding principles for the strengthening \r\nof the coordination of the emergency humanitarian \r\nassistance provided by the United Nations system, \r\nwhile also recognizing that the States affected have the \r\nprimary responsibility for the initiation, organization, \r\ncoordination and implementation of humanitarian \r\nassistance within their territories.\r\nNew elements have been added to this year’s \r\ntext so as to reinforce the essence of the draft \r\nresolution, in particular to seek strengthened support \r\nfor capacity- and resilience-building in the affected \r\nStates and communities, as well as the accelerated \r\nimplementation of the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030. It also seeks to promote \r\ninclusive participation and non-discrimination, and \r\nto enhance the leadership of those in vulnerable \r\nsituations, in particular women and persons with \r\ndisabilities, taking into account the fact that they \r\noften are disproportionately affected in humanitarian \r\nsettings and have less access to humanitarian assistance \r\nin response to their differing needs.\r\nIn closing, the Group of 77 and China would like \r\nto thank the representative of Morocco for successfully \r\ncoordinating the negotiations on this draft resolution. \r\nWe also appreciate the constructive spirit and invaluable \r\nsupport shown by all Member States in the interest of \r\narriving at this final text. It is our hope that the draft \r\nresolution will be adopted by consensus once again at \r\nthis seventy-first session of the General Assembly.\r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n6/26 16-42340\r\nMr. Puchkov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): The topic of my statement is the growing \r\nrole played by Russia in the international system \r\nof emergency and humanitarian response and the \r\nprospects for its development at the present stage.\r\nHumankind in the twenty-first century is \r\nencountering major threats of a global nature. The \r\nnumber and scale of natural disasters, earthquakes, \r\nf loods, tsunamis, volcanic eruptions, hurricanes, \r\ndroughts, wildfire and other disasters are growing. \r\nClimate change worldwide, ecological problems, \r\nurbanization and ageing infrastructure exacerbate \r\nthose negative trends, which, in turn, heightens the \r\nscale of the losses and undermines the livelihoods \r\nof people in vast swathes of territory. Growing man-\r\nmade risks cause grave accidents. The introduction of \r\ndigital technology and modern-day communications \r\ninto our lives poses additional dangers. The global \r\nterrorist threat is gripping more and more regions; \r\narmed conflicts are escalating; and extremism is being \r\nfuelled. That leads to large f lows of migrants and grave \r\nhumanitarian crises.\r\nPractical experience demonstrates the fact that \r\nthe repercussions of major disasters could be of such \r\nmagnitude that even the most developed State would \r\nfind it difficult to effectively and promptly deal with \r\nthem alone, hence the issues involved in fine-tuning \r\nthe international system of emergency humanitarian \r\nresponse take on particular significance. The Russian \r\nFederation is open to the world. We are willing to build \r\nrelations with other States on the basis of trust, respect, \r\nequitable partnership and mutual assistance.\r\nRussia acknowledges the need to build a fair \r\ninternational system, namely, a system based upon \r\ncollective foundations for tackling international issues \r\nin line with the norms of international law, with a \r\ngrowing central coordinating role to be played by \r\nthe United Nations. International cooperation aimed \r\nat preventing and overcoming emergencies, fires \r\nand disasters in present-day conditions fosters the \r\nbringing together of peoples and helps to normalize \r\nand harmonize relations among countries. That helps \r\nto build good-neighbourly relations and promotes the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nCurrently, in Russia, under the guidance of our \r\nPresident, Vladimir Vladimirovich Putin, there is \r\nactive capacity-building of a unified State system for \r\npreventing and overcoming emergencies. Our Ministry \r\nfor Emergency Situations is at the head of that system \r\nand also deals with the crafting and implementing \r\nof State policy aimed at protecting secure and safe \r\nlivelihoods at the federal, regional and local levels.\r\nOur Ministry for Emergency Situations has, on a \r\nstandby footing, a multidimensional, multi-purpose \r\nfire rescue department as well as others. They can \r\nwork independently over lengthy periods of time, and \r\nthey can tackle a host of issues, including rescuing \r\npeople, extinguishing fires, addressing emergencies \r\nand providing assistance to victims. Our Ministry has \r\nits own multipurpose aircraft forces that can quickly \r\ndeliver rescuers, doctors, equipment and humanitarian \r\nsupplies, not only to all regions throughout the vastness \r\nof Russia, but to any part of the world. This enables \r\nwildfires to be successfully addressed and for the most \r\ncomplex emergency tasks to be tackled.\r\nAt the moment, only the units belonging to \r\nRussia’s Ministry for Emergency Situations have been \r\naccredited all over the world by the United Nations \r\nInternational Search and Rescue Advisory Group \r\n(INSARAG) as search-and-rescue teams that meet the \r\nhighest international standards. We have also received \r\naccreditation from the World Health Organization for \r\nour international response through field hospitals and \r\nemergency medical brigades.\r\nIn recent years, Russian rescuers have carried out \r\nmore than 450 international operations, including some \r\n300 major, significant initiatives that met the needs \r\nof the international humanitarian community. During \r\nthose operations we worked with rescuers and with \r\nspecialists in crisis management from almost every \r\ncountry in the world. Millions of people in disaster zones \r\nreceived practical assistance from Russian rescuers. \r\nThis year alone, the Russian Ministry for Emergency \r\nSituations has implemented more than 40 international \r\nhumanitarian operations, helping over 10 countries \r\nin different parts of the world, and millions of people \r\nwho suffered different forms of disasters received \r\nemergency assistance. In recent years, our Ministry \r\nhas carried out humanitarian and rescue operations in \r\nAfghanistan, Israel, Italy, India, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq, \r\nYemen, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nLebanon, Macedonia, Nepal, Pakistan, Portugal and \r\nmany other countries around the world.\r\nRussia accepts international assistance to \r\neliminate the consequences of devastating earthquakes \r\nand catastrophic f loods and to fight forest fires on \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 7/26\r\nits territory. This has enabled us to gain valuable \r\nexperience, draw the necessary conclusions, modernize \r\nthe Russian rescue forces and adopt their development \r\nplan for up to 2020 and beyond.\r\nFurthermore, Russia is a reliable donor to the \r\nUnited Nations Central Emergency Response Fund. \r\nOur total annual contribution reaches over $10 million. \r\nWe provide experts to the United Nations Disaster \r\nAssessment and Coordination Team. We sponsor the \r\npreparation and participation of experts from developing \r\ncountries in field missions. Our Ministry for Emergency \r\nSituations actively promotes the methodology \r\nof INSARAG throughout the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States. We implement capacity-building \r\nprojects of the World Health Organization in the field \r\nof emergency preparedness.\r\nThe Russian Federation is becoming one of the \r\nlargest donors to the United Nations World Food \r\nProgramme, to the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme and to the United Nations Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs. We are robustly \r\nengaged with the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees as well.\r\nOur Ministry for Emergency Situations is a \r\nstrategic partner of the International Civil Defence \r\nOrganization and we play a key role in its strengthening \r\nand development. In the last three years alone, Russia, \r\nthrough international organizations, funnelled more \r\nthan $250 million to address the repercussions of \r\nhumanitarian crises and to provide emergency food and \r\nmedical and other aid to victims. We plan to continue \r\nthis work. The Ministry actively shares best practices \r\nin addressing emergency management and prevention \r\nwith our partners in the Shanghai Cooperation \r\nOrganization, the BRICS nations, and the Asia-Pacific \r\nEconomic Cooperation, inter alia.\r\nWe support the adoption by the General Assembly \r\nof the draft resolution entitled “Persistent legacy of the \r\nChernobyl disaster.” Russia will continue its efforts to \r\nachieve socioeconomic development in areas affected \r\nby radioactive fallout. We shall continue to lend \r\npractical assistance to the victims and to share best \r\npractices in the elimination of the repercussions of \r\nsimilar man-made disasters.\r\nPresident Vladimir Putin, speaking from this \r\nrostrum in September 2015, noted the need for the \r\ninternational community to provide comprehensive \r\nsupport for “countries in difficulties” (A/70/PV.13, p. \r\n26). But he stressed that any assistance to sovereign \r\nStates must not be imposed, it “must be offered rather \r\nthan imposed, and only in accordance with the Charter \r\nof the United Nations” (ibid.). He said that “Russia \r\nbelieves in the huge potential of the United Nations” \r\n(ibid., p. 27) and called for leadership by shared values \r\nand for efforts to be pooled to tackle the problems \r\nwe face.\r\nThe Russian Federation is willing to actively \r\nparticipate in the efforts to develop an international \r\nsystem of emergency humanitarian response under \r\nthe auspices of the United Nations. In that regard, we \r\npropose that the following areas be addressed.\r\nFirst, Russia supports the idea of strengthening and \r\nenlarging the central coordinating role of the United \r\nNations in international humanitarian activities. At \r\nthe same time, we must safeguard the core principles \r\nof humanity, neutrality, impartiality, independence, \r\nrespect for sovereignty and the consent of recipient \r\nStates. Those are universal ideals and bring together \r\nall countries worldwide. We believe that the consistent \r\nimplementation of Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030 should be a key element for \r\nbolstering the international humanitarian system.\r\nSecondly, the Russian Federation proposes the \r\nconstruction of a new economic model for the provision \r\nof international humanitarian assistance. We believe \r\nthat the basis for the model must be that the countries \r\nthat stoke conflicts must bear the main responsibility, \r\nincluding financial responsibility, for assisting refugees \r\nand forcibly displaced persons and for helping all social \r\ninstitutions to resume their operations.\r\nWe must also reduce administrative expenditures. \r\nRight now the share of these budgetary costs for \r\nhumanitarian projects of international organizations \r\ncould reach up to 70 per cent. It turns out that the \r\ninternational donor community largely feeds not \r\nstarving populations, but rather individual charitable \r\norganizations. The need for international humanitarian \r\naid has increased more than sixfold over the past decade. \r\nExpenditures to address natural disasters constitute not \r\nmore than 5 per cent of the international humanitarian \r\nbudget. All the other needs relate to conflicts and \r\nprotracted crises, which have fuelled the rise in \r\nterrorism and extremism and caused major migration \r\nf lows. We think that the settlement and prevention of \r\nconflicts at an early stage are the main way to reduce \r\nthe burden on the international humanitarian system.\r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n8/26 16-42340\r\nThirdly, the Russian Ministry for Emergency \r\nSituations proposes that additional measures are taken \r\nto improve the quality of international assistance. \r\nWe must provide targeted assistance and speed up \r\nour response, since this directly determines the \r\neffectiveness of the assistance. We must ensure the \r\nmaximum autonomy of the international community’s \r\nresponse units so as to reduce the burden on affected \r\nStates, which need to integrate international assistance \r\ninto national efforts to deal with the repercussions of \r\ndisasters. We must be willing to solve a wide range of \r\nhumanitarian challenges and to achieve the ultimate \r\ngoal, which includes saving human lives, rebuilding \r\nlivelihoods and alleviating human suffering. In that \r\nregard, the Ministry deems that work to set uniform \r\nminimum standards and international accreditation \r\nfor response units, beginning with INSARAG and the \r\nWorld Health Organization, is of growing importance. \r\nAnd there are good prospects here.\r\nThis year, Russia accredited yet another Siberian \r\nsearch-and-rescue unit and two field hospitals. We plan \r\nto persevere in this work in the Far East under United \r\nNations auspices, including by lending assistance in the \r\npreparation and conduct of international certification \r\nfor rescue and medical units of other countries. Our \r\nrescuer colleagues are called upon to actively engage \r\nin that work.\r\nWe must address the growing social demand to \r\nmeet the basic needs of affected populations. Refugees \r\nand internally displaced persons need to be provided \r\nwith adequate accommodation, including water supply, \r\nsanitation and disposal of household waste, and other \r\nassistance to meet the needs of people, especially \r\nchildren, women and the elderly. Such approaches will \r\nenable the building over the long term, under United \r\nNations auspices, of a sound capacity for an effective \r\ninternational response on the basis of autonomous \r\nhigh-tech modules in different areas that can easily \r\nbe integrated with one another and with the national \r\nefforts of affected States.\r\nFourthly, the Russian Federation deems it necessary \r\nto step up efforts to improve the international normative, \r\nlegal and contractual frameworks. That would allow \r\nthe rapid dispatch to disaster areas of United Nations \r\ncertified international response units and humanitarian \r\nsupplies. They must cover humanitarian assistance \r\ndelivered under United Nations auspices, including \r\nprompt consent for operational permits for aircraft \r\noverflights, visa-free travel of emergency staff and \r\nother specialists, streamlined customs procedures \r\nand unimpeded entry of canine teams, equipment and \r\nmedicines. We propose creating a United Nations special \r\nexpert group for the elaboration of such documents.\r\nFifthly, the Russian Ministry for Emergency \r\nSituations proposes that assistance be organized for \r\ndeveloping countries to train national fire rescue forces \r\nand civil-protection services. We need to build their \r\ncapacity to independently manage their own major \r\nemergencies and other disasters, especially at the initial \r\nstages. Instead of trying to provide for the millions of \r\nrefugees in Europe, we need to create opportunities for \r\nthem to remain in their homes, or at least in those areas \r\nwhere the cultural ambiance and the social and climatic \r\nconditions are similar to those they left. It is especially \r\nimportant for developing countries to acknowledge \r\ntheir role. They must not be passive recipients of \r\ninternational aid, but must actively participate in \r\nthose processes.\r\nWe must develop emergency response capacities, \r\nbut we must also improve the disaster prevention \r\nmechanisms. We see great promise in the risk-\r\ninsurance programmes and in the introduction of new \r\nmodern mechanisms of warnings and prevention in \r\nemergencies, fires and other disasters and to manage \r\nrisks. We need to give greater attention to awareness- \r\nraising in public education, paying special attention \r\nto children, to women and to persons working in \r\npotentially dangerous sites, so that people are trained \r\nto deal with emergencies and disasters and a culture of \r\nhealthy and safe livelihoods prevails.\r\nSixthly, Russia deems it necessary to fine-tune the \r\ncoordination of international assistance. In that regard, \r\nthe Russian Federation has put forward an initiative \r\nwhereby the national and regional crises centres taking \r\npart in international humanitarian operations would \r\ncome together in a single global network and work out \r\nharmonized operational standards. We believe that such \r\na network would make for more effective cooperation \r\nin the exchange and analysis of information, especially \r\nin the first days and hours following the outbreak of a \r\nmajor disaster. That would be important in determining \r\ninternational assistance requirements and also in \r\nimproving the quality and promptness of the decisions \r\ntaken, in both the countries in need of assistance and \r\nthose that provide assistance in disaster areas.\r\nIn this context, the Russian Ministry for Emergency \r\nSituations has built a national network bringing together \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 9/26\r\nmore than 90 crisis centres and more than 2,000 \r\norganizations engaged in monitoring and forecasting \r\nemergencies, wildfires and other disasters. We are \r\nbuilding the technical capabilities of Russia’s National \r\nCentre for Crisis Management. Its organizational \r\nstructure is being streamlined. The future global \r\nnetwork of crisis centres for the coordination of \r\nhumanitarian assistance across the Commonwealth of \r\nIndependent States has established effective working \r\ncontacts with the emergency services of border States, \r\nas well as the coordination centres of countries of the \r\nShanghai Cooperation Organization, the European \r\nUnion and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations.\r\nThe International Monitoring and Coordination \r\nCentre of the International Civil Defence Organization \r\nand the Emergency Relief Coordination Centre \r\nin Geneva of the Office for the Coordination of \r\nHumanitarian Affairs (OCHA) were set up and are \r\noperating with technical and financial support from \r\nRussia. We further need to implement initiatives under \r\nthe leadership of the United Nations. As an initial \r\npractical step, we propose that a working group should \r\nbe established under OCHA auspices to craft single \r\nprotocols for the exchange of information, minimum \r\nstandards and the accreditation of crisis centres, as \r\nINSARAG has done, for integration into the global \r\nnetwork. The participation of the leading world Powers \r\nin the activities of this working group will help to \r\npromote the exchange of best practices, to fine-tune \r\nthe entire system of exchange of best practices, to \r\nefficiently allocate roles among the major crisis centres \r\nand to further synergize efforts.\r\nIn recent years, the role of the Russian Federation \r\nhas increased considerably in the international system \r\nof providing emergency assistance. Russia intends \r\nto continue to build its capacity in this sphere and to \r\npromote its participation in international humanitarian \r\noperations and projects, primarily those carried out \r\nunder the auspices of the United Nations. We believe \r\nthat our humanitarian action will help give hope and \r\nconfidence in the future to ordinary people living on \r\nvarious continents. This will make our world a better, \r\nmore comfortable, safer and kinder place.\r\nIn our opinion, owing to the magnitude of the \r\nhumanitarian issues currently faced, the coordinating \r\nrole of the United Nations must be strengthened \r\nsignificantly and the various efforts — including those \r\nof all the State institutions and civic associations of the \r\ndeveloped and other countries — must be united. We \r\nalso need to actively engage all civic institutions and \r\nvoluntary organizations in those efforts. Only through \r\nclose international cooperation can we successfully \r\ntackle the major global problems we face in international \r\nemergency humanitarian response.\r\nThe President: I now call on the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\nMr. Vale de Almeida (European Union): I have the \r\nhonour to speak on behalf of the European Union and \r\nits member States. The candidate countries Turkey, the \r\nformer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Montenegro, \r\nSerbia and Albania; the country of the Stabilization \r\nand Association Process and potential candidate Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina; as well as Ukraine, the Republic \r\nof Moldova and Georgia, align themselves with this \r\nstatement\r\nToday, the scale of human suffering is greater \r\nthan at any time since the United Nations was \r\nfounded. Currently, 130 million people are dependent \r\non humanitarian assistance for their protection and \r\nsurvival from conflict and disasters; more than \r\n65 million people have been displaced as they f lee \r\nviolence or persecution — the highest number since the \r\nSecond World War; half of the displaced are children.\r\nToday, armed conflicts are tearing apart vast parts \r\nof the world. Millions of people are exposed to violence \r\nand live with less than adequate water, food, shelter \r\nand health services. Millions of children are out of \r\nschool. International humanitarian law is increasingly \r\ndisregarded by parties to conflicts. Hospitals are \r\nbeing attacked, and patients, doctors, nurses and \r\nhumanitarian workers targeted, often killed. Natural \r\ndisasters continue to cause important human and \r\neconomic losses. Since 2008, an average of 26.4 million \r\npeople per year have been displaced from their homes \r\nby disasters brought on by natural hazards.\r\nToday, humanitarian crises are a global \r\nphenomenon. They affect not only a large number of \r\npeople, but their repercussions are felt way beyond \r\nthe borders of affected areas. They are also much \r\nmore protracted, meaning that it is not good enough to \r\nbring food, shelter and medical assistance to people; \r\nwe also need to bring jobs, schools and hope. The gap \r\nbetween humanitarian needs and the resources and \r\ncapacity of response continues to increase. The world \r\ntoday spends around $25 billion to provide life-saving \r\nassistance to millions of people devastated by wars and \r\nnatural disasters. While this amount is 12 times greater \r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n10/26 16-42340\r\nthan 15 years ago, never before has generosity been \r\nso insufficient. Over the past few years conflicts and \r\nnatural disasters have led to fast-growing numbers of \r\npeople in need, and the funding gap for humanitarian \r\naction amounts to an estimated $15 billion.\r\nThe European Union and its member States \r\nare committed to assuming their part of the shared \r\nresponsibility of the international community to save \r\nlives, alleviate suffering and preserve human dignity. \r\nIn recent months, States Members of the United \r\nNations have made great progress in Sendai, Addis \r\nAbaba, New York, Paris and Istanbul, where the first-\r\never World Humanitarian Summit was held. Important \r\ncommitments were made by all relevant stakeholders. \r\nNow is the time to turn talk into action and to implement \r\nthose commitments.\r\nThe EU and its member States welcome the \r\npowerful vision set out in the Secretary-General’s \r\nAgenda for Humanity (A/70/709), which should now \r\nprogress and deliver concrete results in a number \r\nof key areas. We reaffirm our commitment to the \r\nhumanitarian principles of humanity, neutrality, \r\nimpartiality and independence and to preventing the \r\npoliticization and instrumentalization of humanitarian \r\naid. Humanitarian action cannot substitute for political \r\nsolutions. Respect for international humanitarian \r\nlaw, including safeguarding humanitarian access and \r\ncombating impunity for violations, should top the \r\ninternational agenda.\r\nProtecting civilians and aid workers is a priority \r\ntoday, more than ever before. The entire international \r\ncommunity needs to speak out and systematically \r\ncondemn violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw. Serious violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw cause intolerable human suffering and aggravate \r\nhumanitarian crises. When principled humanitarian \r\naction is respected by all parties to a conflicts, \r\nhumanitarian workers can operate in even the most \r\ntense, dangerous and volatile theatres of war. When \r\ninternational humanitarian law and principled \r\nhumanitarian action are not respected. then people are \r\nabandoned, the notion of protection loses meaning and \r\nhumanity is f louted.\r\nThe EU and its member States will continue to \r\nadvocate strongly and consistently for respect for \r\ninternational law, including international humanitarian \r\nlaw, refugee law and international human rights law. \r\nAll parties to armed conflicts must comply with \r\ninternational humanitarian law, including the principles \r\nof distinction, proportionality and precaution, as also \r\nreflected in customary international law. And in cases \r\nof serious violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw, accountability is of the greatest importance. \r\nFull, prompt, impartial and effective investigations \r\nare needed, including through use of the International \r\nCriminal Court as a court of last resort.\r\nWe must continue our efforts to ensure that aid is \r\nmore effective and more accountable with respect to the \r\npeople it is intended to serve. The EU and its member \r\nStates reiterate their continued commitment to putting \r\npeople at the centre of their humanitarian action. We \r\nmust work together to ensure that the humanitarian \r\nprotection agenda and related action genuinely deliver \r\nto those most vulnerable and most in need. Women, \r\nchildren, older persons and people with disabilities are \r\ndisproportionally vulnerable to the effects of disasters \r\nand conflicts. Humanitarian operations must take into \r\naccount their specific needs and capacities and involve \r\nthem throughout the response cycle.\r\nAlso, humanitarian aid and the humanitarian \r\nsystem overall must become much more efficient \r\nthrough improvements by all actors, including donors \r\nand operators. That is not about saving money, but \r\nabout saving lives with dignity and being more \r\neffective. Donors should not simply give more, but \r\ngive better, through greater f lexibility, providing \r\nincreased predictability and reducing as much as \r\npossible the administrative barriers. At the same time, \r\naid organizations should reciprocate with greater \r\ntransparency and cost-consciousness, by employing \r\nthe best and most efficient aid modalities and by \r\nrecognizing the comparative advantages of local, \r\nnational and international implementing organizations \r\nfor the delivery of services.\r\nThere must be coherence and cooperation among \r\nhumanitarian and development programming and \r\nfinancing, in accordance with the respective mandates, \r\naiming at common results in reducing need and \r\nvulnerability over multiple years and based on a common \r\nunderstanding of the context of each actor’s operational \r\nstrengths and planning and programming processes.\r\nLast but not least, we need to continue working \r\nto reduce humanitarian needs. The best way to deal \r\nwith growing humanitarian needs is to address the \r\nroot causes. That requires strong determination at the \r\nhighest level of global political leadership to prevent \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 11/26\r\nand resolve conflicts. We should not forget that \r\nhumanitarian aid can never be the solution to a crisis. We \r\nurge the international community to work on political \r\nsolutions to put an end to ongoing conflicts, which is \r\nthe only way to put an end to the human suffering that \r\nfollows in their wake.\r\nThere is also a need to increase investment in \r\ndisaster risk reduction, especially in the most vulnerable \r\ncommunities and countries, integrating the latest \r\nscientific achievements to improve preparedness and \r\nresponse. We must continue efforts to build resilience, \r\nas underlined in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the commitments of the Sendai \r\nFramework for Disaster Risk Reduction.\r\nThe European Union and its member States remain \r\ncollectively the world’s largest humanitarian donor. Our \r\ncitizens’ solidarity with those in need has withstood \r\neconomic hardship in much of Europe. It is again being \r\ntested by the migrant and refugee crisis. We remain \r\ncommitted to providing protection to those f leeing \r\npersecution at home. We have stepped up humanitarian \r\naid and civil protection resources to match the growing \r\nneeds of refugees. We will continue to enhance our \r\nhumanitarian aid to affected populations in third \r\ncountries, based only on their needs and vulnerabilities. \r\nThe objective of our humanitarian aid is to save lives \r\nand alleviate suffering, wherever it is found. We shall \r\ncontinue doing our part in a principled manner, and we \r\ncount on others to continue or to start doing the same.\r\nMr. Pecsteen de Buytswerve (Belgium), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe challenges facing the humanitarian community \r\ntoday are enormous. As the General Assembly, we \r\nneed to contribute to that work through the resolutions \r\nwe are adopting today — by further strengthening \r\nthe agreed framework for humanitarian action in \r\nthe successor draft resolution to 46/182, which was \r\nintroduced and skilfully facilitated, sometimes under \r\ndifficult circumstances, by one of our member States, \r\nSweden (A/71/L.32); by strongly recalling the need \r\nto ensure the safety and security of humanitarian and \r\nUnited Nations personnel through the draft resolution \r\nintroduced by Slovakia on behalf of the 28 member \r\nStates of the European Union (A/71/L.34); and by \r\nbetter addressing the consequences of natural disasters, \r\nthrough the draft resolution introduced by Thailand on \r\nbehalf of the Group of 77 and China and ably facilitated \r\nby Morocco (A/71/L.33). We thank Ola and Omar for \r\ntheir remarkable service.\r\nAllow me to emphasize that these and the other \r\nhumanitarian resolutions adopted by the General \r\nAssembly here today have been and should remain \r\ngenuinely consensual, as a testimony to our shared \r\nhumanity. Twenty-five years after the adoption of \r\nresolution 46/182 by the Assembly, our united voice is as \r\nnecessary as ever. In that spirit, facilitators have made \r\ntheir utmost effort to secure agreement in good faith \r\nand in a transparent manner, resolutions expressing our \r\ncommon views. We must support that effort. We owe \r\nit to the people who rely on humanitarian assistance. \r\nWe owe it to the people who risk their lives on a daily \r\nbasis in order to save the lives of others. They need the \r\ncollective, unequivocal and unqualified support of the \r\nentire General Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): Before \r\ngiving the f loor to the next speaker, I will give the f loor \r\nto the representative of Greece on a point of order.\r\nMr. Christodoulidis (Greece): Regarding the \r\nway that the representative of the Russian Federation \r\nreferred to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, \r\nmy delegation would like to remind the Assembly that \r\npursuant to Security Council resolution 817 (1993) and \r\nthe subsequent General Assembly resolution 47/225, \r\ndated 27 April 1993, that country will be provisionally \r\nreferred to for all purposes within the United Nations \r\nas the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia pending \r\nsettlement of the difference that has arisen over the \r\nname of that State.\r\nMr. Ismail (Brunei Darussalam): I have the honour \r\nof delivering this statement on behalf of the 10 member \r\nStates of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN), namely, Cambodia, Indonesia, the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic, Malaysia, Myanmar, \r\nthe Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Viet Nam and my \r\nown country, Brunei Darussalam.\r\nWe would like to thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his comprehensive report on the current status of \r\nthe humanitarian assistance requirements, critical \r\nrecommendations and the way forward in dealing with \r\nthe numerous crises facing our world today. We note \r\nwith concern the growing number of people who require \r\nassistance, and now more than ever, those unfortunate \r\nvictims of circumstance need our help.\r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n12/26 16-42340\r\nThe ASEAN region experiences its share of \r\ndisasters, and therefore disaster management remains \r\na key priority for us. At the recent ASEAN Summit \r\nin Laos, ASEAN leaders adopted the Declaration on \r\nOne ASEAN, One Response: ASEAN Responding \r\nto Disasters as One in the Region and Outside the \r\nRegion. Its purpose is to achieve faster responses, \r\nmobilize greater resources and establish stronger \r\ncoordination, so as to ensure a collective regional \r\nresponse to disasters. With its implementation based on \r\nthe ASEAN Agreement on Disaster Management and \r\nEmergency Response, the Declaration further affirmed \r\nthe ASEAN Coordinating Centre for Humanitarian \r\nAssistance on Disaster Management as the primary \r\nASEAN regional coordinating agency on disaster \r\nmanagement and emergency response, and endorsed the \r\nASEAN Emergency Response and Assessment Team as \r\nthe official emergency response resource of ASEAN.\r\nThe One ASEAN, One Response Declaration was \r\nrecently put into action during the ASEAN Regional \r\nDisaster Emergency Response Simulation Exercise, \r\njointly organized by Brunei Darussalam and the \r\nASEAN Humanitarian Assistance Centre, which tested \r\nASEAN communication capacities in coordinating \r\nassistance through the ASEAN Standard Operating \r\nProcedure for Regional Standby Arrangements and \r\nCoordination of Joint Disaster Relief and Emergency \r\nResponse Operations in a table-top setting. The exercise \r\nalso included testing the coordination between ASEAN \r\nsectoral bodies and the United Nations Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA), which \r\nyielded valuable lessons on the inter-operability of the \r\nhost country and international responders.\r\nWith regard to other aspects of ASEAN \r\nhumanitarian assistance efforts, earlier this year we \r\ninaugurated the ASEAN Regional Mine Action Centre \r\nin Phnom Penh, which will serve as a regional centre \r\nof excellence in sharing expertise and best practices \r\nto address the humanitarian aspects of landmines and \r\nexplosive remnants of war.\r\nThose are just some of the examples that ASEAN \r\nhas been working on to provide humanitarian assistance \r\nand disaster relief to those in need. Since establishing \r\ndialogue-partner relations in 2006, ASEAN and \r\nthe United Nations have cooperated on a wide \r\nrange of issues, including humanitarian assistance, \r\nwhich features significantly in the Plan of Action to \r\nImplement the Joint Declaration on Comprehensive \r\nPartnership between ASEAN and the United Nations \r\n(2016-2020), adopted recently. ASEAN has also been \r\nactively aligning its disaster risk management efforts \r\nwith the implementation, monitoring and reporting \r\narrangements of relevant United Nation frameworks, \r\nincluding the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction and the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nAt a time when many are suffering from natural \r\nand human-induced disasters, ASEAN commends the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General to convene the World \r\nHumanitarian Summit in Istanbul on 23 and 24 May, \r\nwhich brought Member States together in discussions on \r\nhow to save lives, alleviate suffering and make progress \r\non the way forward the Agenda for Humanity. In that \r\nvein, ASEAN strives to respond to disasters and adopt a \r\nprogrammatic and inclusive approach to institutionalize \r\nresilience by engaging peoples and communities, \r\ninvesting in joint preparedness, enhancing the role of \r\nregional organizations and networks and serving as a \r\nglobal nexus for knowledge-sharing and innovation \r\nexchange in that field.\r\nIn that regard, we look forward to working \r\nwith the United Nations under the framework of the \r\nASEAN-United Nations Joint Strategic Plan of Action \r\non Disaster Management for 2016-2020 to support \r\nthe ASEAN vision for disaster and climate-resilient \r\ncommunities, reducing disaster losses and to better \r\nrespond to humanitarian disasters in a collective \r\nmanner, as reflected in the Declaration on One ASEAN, \r\nOne Response.\r\nASEAN remains committed to ensuring that our \r\nnational and regional efforts continue to complement \r\nand contribute positively to the work of the United \r\nNations, especially OCHA. Moreover, ASEAN will \r\ncontinue to do its best to strengthen and improve our \r\ncoordination work and better prepare ourselves for any \r\nfuture humanitarian and disaster relief needs.\r\nMr. Lal (India): It is my privilege to deliver a \r\njoint statement on behalf of India and Sweden on the \r\nissue of humanitarian and disaster relief assistance. \r\nIn the interest of time, I will read out parts of our \r\njoint statement.\r\nIndia and Sweden have enjoyed a strong partnership \r\non this joint initiative for the past several years, sharing \r\na profound commitment regarding the international \r\nhumanitarian response system. The magnitude, \r\ngeographical expanse and frequency of humanitarian \r\ncrises that require international assistance around the \r\nworld are unparalleled. Their impacts are being felt far \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 13/26\r\nand wide. The international humanitarian system is \r\nfalling significantly short of the challenges posed at a \r\ntime when humanitarian needs have quadrupled in just \r\n10 years.\r\nHumanitarian crises can have multiple causes, \r\nranging from unexpected natural disasters, to armed \r\nconflicts that are frequently situations of civil wars \r\nassociated with terrorism, to outbreaks of pandemics. \r\nThey all require our common efforts to provide urgent \r\nrelief for our most vulnerable fellow men and women.\r\nThe landmark collective will displayed last year in \r\nfinalizing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Paris Agreement on Climate Change gives \r\nhope that the international community can rise to the \r\nchallenges that are increasingly interconnected and \r\nhave implications for us all. The Sendai Framework \r\nfor Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-2030 is a significant \r\ncollective effort to work towards the goals of reducing \r\nthe impact on societies and economies, and building \r\nresilience through enhanced international cooperation. \r\nThe World Humanitarian Summit held earlier this year \r\nwas another significant initiative.\r\nThe United Nations humanitarian agencies, \r\nalong with many other stakeholders, have been doing \r\ncommendable work in addressing humanitarian needs \r\nin various contexts. However, attempts to address all \r\nof the different forms of humanitarian challenges with \r\na single, unified approach would be ineffective and \r\ninefficient. The identification of complementarity and \r\ngreater coordination among the various humanitarian \r\nagencies needs careful consideration. Humanitarian \r\nresponse efforts must be context-based and make \r\nuse of local capacities. There is enormous potential \r\nin strengthening local actors, who are often based in \r\ncivil society. We have witnessed their committed and \r\nsometimes heroic contributions to an effective and \r\nprincipled humanitarian response.\r\nIt is estimated that there are currently more than \r\n20 million refugees throughout the world, three fourths \r\nof whom come from just 11 countries. Seven countries \r\nhost more than half of all refugees. Nearly 90 per cent \r\nof all refugees are hosted in developing countries. That \r\nshows that there is a need for some course correction \r\nand reforms at the United Nations.\r\nWhen global humanitarian needs reach \r\nunprecedented levels, the international community’s \r\nefforts to mobilize adequate resources must be \r\nredoubled. We underline the need for increased \r\nf lexibility for humanitarian actors to use the funding \r\nthey receive so that every dollar is spent efficiently and \r\naccording to humanitarian needs. We urge new donors \r\nto join the commendable efforts of existing ones. \r\nWhile adequate funding for the humanitarian response \r\nremains a significant challenge, an emphasis on longer-\r\nterm planning is also necessary to help build resilience \r\nin countries where that is needed. Building resilience \r\nultimately leads to a decreased need of large-scale \r\nhumanitarian responses.\r\nIssues of concern also include those relating to \r\naccess for and protection of humanitarian workers \r\nand the more vulnerable sections of society, including \r\nwomen and children. Those require serious attention. \r\nWe welcome the draft resolution on the safety and \r\nsecurity of humanitarian personnel and protection of \r\nUnited Nations personnel (A/71/L.34), which is before \r\nus for adoption today.\r\nIn recent times, there have been attempts to blur the \r\ncategories of those impacted by crises, such as refugees, \r\nmigrants and internally displaced persons (IDPs). All \r\nthose are distinct categories because of the reasons why \r\npeople had to leave their homes. Every international \r\nframework drawn up by the international community is \r\nalso distinct for different categories, especially refugees \r\nand migrants. International cooperation is required, in \r\nview of the implications of the cross-border mobility of \r\nsuch individuals. IDPs are and must remain the priority \r\nof national jurisdiction.\r\nWe must recognize that humanitarian crises become \r\nacute and unmanageable in situations in which levels of \r\ndevelopment are relatively lower, with limited capacities \r\nto respond, manage and rebuild. Improving development \r\nlevels invariably leads to crises being easier to manage. \r\nTherefore, it is in everyone’s interest — including \r\nthe providers of assistance, whether for development \r\nor for humanitarian relief — to invest in sustainable \r\ndevelopment at all levels. Stronger partnerships are \r\nneeded within the United Nations family to approach \r\nhumanitarian and development challenges coherently.\r\nIndia has always been forthcoming, within its \r\nability and national circumstance, in offering relief \r\nand reconstruction assistance according to the needs \r\nand requests of our friends and partners. In recent \r\nyears, India has assisted in relief efforts in a number \r\nof countries, including, for instance, its neighbours \r\nthat have been affected by natural disasters, such as \r\nNepal, Sri Lanka, Maldives and Afghanistan, and those \r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n14/26 16-42340\r\nfurther afield, such as the Philippines, Fiji, Yemen \r\nand Somalia. Those efforts have ranged from the \r\nimmediate supply of relief materials to the emergency \r\nevacuation of very large numbers of persons of various \r\nnationalities from danger zones. Last month, with the \r\nUnited Nations Office for Disaster Risk Reduction, \r\nIndia co-hosted the Asian Ministerial Conference on \r\nDisaster Risk Reduction in New Delhi. In August India \r\nalso hosted the meeting of the Ministers for Disaster \r\nManagement, involving Brazil, Russia, India, China \r\nand South Africa.\r\nSweden remains one of the world’s largest \r\nhumanitarian donors, contributing to nearly every \r\nhumanitarian crisis response across the globe. As \r\na strong advocate for a need-based, non-political \r\nhumanitarian response system, Sweden is one of the \r\nsingle largest donors of unearmarked, core support to \r\nUnited Nations humanitarian organizations. Sweden \r\nis also a key policy contributor to humanitarian \r\naffairs and a dedicated advocate for international \r\nhumanitarian law and unimpeded humanitarian access. \r\nAs the current Chair of Call to Action on Protection \r\nfrom Gender-based Violence in Emergencies, Sweden \r\npromotes increased protection for women, girls, \r\nboys and men in humanitarian crises. Sweden is a \r\nlong-standing contributor to humanitarian reform \r\nand a dedicated signatory to the “grand bargain” for \r\nhumanitarian financing with a view towards more \r\neffective, transparent and inclusive humanitarian aid.\r\nAs we work towards improving the international \r\nhumanitarian architecture, the salience of the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nneeds to be preserved. For assistance to be effective, it \r\nmust be provided impartially, with the consent and at the \r\nrequest of the affected country. We therefore reaffirm \r\nthat the primary responsibility for providing protection \r\nand humanitarian assistance in a crisis always lies with \r\nthe affected State.\r\nIndia and Sweden reaffirm that humanitarian \r\nprinciples and international humanitarian law provide \r\nthe basis for humanitarian assistance. The essence \r\nof resolution 46/182 is the call for collective efforts \r\nby the international community and the United \r\nNations in responding to humanitarian crises. We are \r\ncommitted to preserving and strengthening respect \r\nfor and adherence to the humanitarian principles of \r\nhumanity, neutrality, impartiality and independence. \r\nThe United Nations should continue to play a central \r\nrole in providing leadership and coordination in the \r\nefforts of the international community to support the \r\nstrengthening of response capacity in a timely and cost-\r\neffective manner.\r\nLet us in the end not overlook the core of what \r\nwe are talking about: human beings. The essence of \r\nhumanitarian response is to save their lives, to alleviate \r\ntheir suffering and to maintain their dignity in the \r\nface of situations of natural disasters and violence. We \r\ncall on all States to respect and honour international \r\nhumanitarian law and humanitarian principles. India \r\nand Sweden remain committed to working with all \r\nparties to address the world’s humanitarian challenges \r\nin an effective and comprehensive manner.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now give \r\nthe f loor to the Permanent Observer of the Observer \r\nState of Palestine.\r\nMr. Mansour (Palestine) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nhave taken note of the report of the Secretary-General \r\nentitled “Assistance to the Palestinian people” (A/71/87), \r\nwhich covers the period from April 2015 to March \r\n2016. I thank all those who contributed to preparing the \r\nreport, which sheds light on the quality and quantity \r\nof the services and assistance provided by agencies \r\nand programmes to the Palestinian people. We agree \r\nwith most of what the report says about the assistance \r\nprovided by the United Nations to the Palestinian \r\npeople, but we reaffirm the need to distinguish \r\nbetween rescue operations for the Palestinian people \r\nand activities aimed at the development to which the \r\nPalestinian people aspire. The aid in question is purely \r\nhumanitarian and is aimed at dealing with urgent \r\nand imminent situations in a timely manner. Those \r\noperations therefore assure a minimum level of what is \r\nrequired for minimum comforts of human life.\r\nThe development process, however, is a cumulative \r\nprocess that lays the foundation for stability and \r\nhumanitarian, social and political development and \r\nstrives to ensure a stable and sustainable economic \r\nfuture in which quality of life is an objective, rather \r\nthan a process that simply maintains life support, as is \r\nthe case today. Development is a process of investing \r\nin the future whereby dividends increase with time and \r\nthe entire society benefits. In that context, we extend \r\nour heartfelt thanks to the donors and the United \r\nNations agencies and programmes for their assistance \r\nto the Palestinian people in general, and especially to \r\nthose living under the Israeli occupation.\r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 15/26\r\nThe Palestinian economy is suffering from \r\ndeep-rooted structural defects because of the Israeli \r\noccupation, which has lasted for more than 50 years, as \r\nwell as the policies and obstacles imposed by Israel, the \r\noccupying Power, that are impeding the development of \r\nthe Palestinian economy. That is a clear violation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development:\r\n“States are strongly urged to refrain from \r\npromulgating and applying any unilateral economic, \r\nfinancial or trade measures not in accordance with \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations that impede the full achievement of \r\neconomic and social development, particularly in \r\ndeveloping countries.” (resolution 70/1, para. 30)\r\nWe are not able to control the macroeconomic \r\ntools — monitoring and fiscal policy — which are \r\nthe two main tools for managing the macroeconomy \r\nso as to reach a point of equilibrium. An example \r\nof the structural anomalies from which the already \r\nvulnerable Palestinian economy suffers that negatively \r\naffects its general performance is what has happened \r\nat the land crossings with the Hashemite Kingdom of \r\nJordan during the past few days. Those crossings are \r\ncompletely controlled by Israel. Since 4 November, \r\nIsraeli customs personnel have been on strike, which \r\nhas meant that exports from Palestine to the rest of the \r\nworld have been reduced as much as 90 per cent. That \r\nis a huge loss in accounting terms, and the economic \r\nlosses are even greater.\r\nIn 2013, the World Bank evaluated the cost of the \r\nIsraeli occupation of Area C, which constitutes about \r\n61 per cent of the West Bank territory. That evaluation \r\nrelated to economic sectors, and the World Bank \r\nestimated that, if restrictions in Area C were lifted, the \r\ngross domestic product would increase by 41 per cent, \r\nand the fiscal deficit would be reduced by 60 per cent.\r\nWe are determined to establish a Palestinian \r\ndevelopment plan for the period 2017 to 2022 that will \r\nenable us to move from an emergency rescue situation \r\nto operations that will really permit development and \r\nmake us more independent of donor funds. The national \r\nplan will accord with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. To ensure the success of the plan, we call \r\nupon the Assembly to work alongside us with a text that \r\ntakes into account our particular situation as a people \r\nunder occupation, particularly when the development \r\nprogramme is adopted. It is in that way that we can see \r\ngenuine development that will lead to a better future, \r\nwith no one left behind.\r\nWe are determined to overcome all obstacles; that is \r\nvery clear. For 23 years now, since the peace agreement, \r\nwe have been able to establish governmental and \r\nnon-governmental organizations capable of managing \r\na modern State with great efficiency.\r\nThe private sector in Palestine has been able \r\nto build the model city of Rawabi, and Secretary-\r\nGeneral Ban Ki-moon, who visited the town, praised \r\nit. We have a banking sector that is recognized for the \r\nexcellence of its performance and services in our part \r\nof the world. We have also ensured good management \r\nof our agricultural resources, which have managed \r\nto reach European markets. In education, we provide \r\nfree education services to the end of the secondary \r\nlevel. The illiteracy rate in Palestine is the lowest in \r\nthe world. During the past three years, the Palestinian \r\nGovernment has increased revenue by 60 per cent and \r\nreduced the deficit by more than 40 per cent, despite the \r\nreduction of foreign aid by 70 per cent over recent years.\r\nThe United Nations Relief and Works Agency for \r\nPalestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) plans \r\nto carry out a global study with the Economic and \r\nSocial Commission for Western Asia, covering the \r\nIsraeli occupation of the West Bank, including East \r\nJerusalem and the Gaza Strip. The study will assess the \r\neconomic losses caused by the occupation that are being \r\nexperienced by the Palestinian people. I am sure that, \r\nwhen the study is finished and published, the results \r\nwill be shocking, and the Assembly will realize that \r\ntotal sum being paid to the Palestinian people is simply \r\nthe bill for the Israeli occupation.\r\nWhat we have lost due to the Israeli occupation of \r\nthe Palestinian people is much greater than what we \r\nhave been offered by the international community in \r\nterms of assistance. If we were really able to access and \r\ndevelop our own economic resources, then we could \r\nreally benefit from a strong, independent economy and \r\nnot need all this international assistance.\r\nMs. Wilson (Australia): Each year, we come \r\ntogether in this Hall to note the progress we have made in \r\nstrengthening coordination in the humanitarian system. \r\nAustralia welcomes once more the opportunity to add \r\nour voice and commitment to the important reforms \r\ngenerated by various forums in 2016, particularly from \r\nthe World Humanitarian Summit onwards.\r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n16/26 16-42340\r\nWe support efforts to better use development \r\napproaches to improve resilience and reduce \r\nhumanitarian need. We also encourage efforts to better \r\nsupport local leadership and context-specific responses \r\nwherever possible, including through targeted \r\ninvestments in preparedness. Those efforts have been \r\nvery effective in reducing loss and damage in our \r\nregion, such as in the responses to tropical Cyclones \r\nWinston and Pam in the Pacific.\r\nThe grand bargain to increase cash programming, \r\nmulti-year collaborative planning and better prioritized \r\nneeds assessments will drive efficiency and effectiveness, \r\nas will greater investments in gender equality and \r\nwomen’s empowerment, disability inclusiveness, \r\ninnovation and private-sector engagement. But much \r\nof this is tinkering with, rather than transforming, \r\nthe humanitarian system. We must go further in our \r\nambitions for humanitarian reform. We must have a \r\ncomprehensive approach to sustaining peace by the \r\nUnited Nations system, particularly by addressing the \r\nroot causes of conflict to reduce humanitarian need. We \r\nmust invest in sustaining peace, disaster risk reduction, \r\nbetter support for internally displaced persons and host \r\ncountries and address climate change, if we hope to \r\nreduce spiralling humanitarian need.\r\nThe year 2016 has been an abhorrent reminder that \r\nthe cornerstones of international norms and laws are \r\nbeing threatened and disregarded, and civilians are \r\ndisproportionately paying the price. We must work to \r\nprotect and uphold international law. Australia stands \r\nwith Emergency Relief Coordinator Stephen O’Brien in \r\ncalling on all parties to conflicts to respect and protect \r\naffected populations, in the name of restoring basic \r\nhumanity. All parties are reminded of their obligations \r\nto protect civilians under international humanitarian \r\nlaw and human rights law. The arbitrary and wilful \r\ndenial of humanitarian access is an international \r\ndisgrace and can constitute a war crime.\r\nWe condemn the ever-increasing targeted attacks on \r\nhumanitarian workers, those already risking their lives \r\nto save others. The indiscriminate attacks on civilians, \r\nsieges and the use of torture, rape and sexual violence \r\nare crimes and must stop. All too often women, children \r\nand persons with disabilities are disproportionately \r\nvictims of those crimes. We condemn those acts in the \r\nstrongest terms.\r\nHistory has demonstrated time and again just how \r\ndifficult it is to prevent cycles of violence in the absence \r\nof justice. We must heed that lesson. Australia is \r\ncommitted to holding to account those most responsible \r\nfor the crimes I mentioned. The International Criminal \r\nCourt, as a court of last resort, can have a critical role \r\nto play in that regard.\r\nThe humanitarian system is being challenged \r\non many fronts. With unprecedented need and finite \r\nresources, it is a matter of reform or fail. The World \r\nHumanitarian Summit reminded us that people must \r\nbe at the centre of humanitarian action and that a \r\nholistic approach in the humanitarian, development \r\nand peacebuilding ecosystem is required to address the \r\nunprecedented humanitarian demands we face today. \r\nWe must ensure that humanitarian and development \r\ninvestments deliver better results to people in order to \r\nmore effectively support communities.\r\nThe international community made significant \r\ncommitments to address the root causes of crises and \r\ndisplacement through the New York Declaration for \r\nRefugees and Migrants and future global compact \r\n(resolution 71/1 and annexes), the Paris Agreement \r\non climate change, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and the Sendai Framework for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction 2015-2030. In a year of massive global \r\ndisplacement, increasing disasters linked to climate \r\nchange and growing inequality, those frameworks \r\nhave the potential to address the major challenges we \r\nnow face.\r\nWe should all be able to look back on 2016 as \r\nthe year we championed a reformed humanitarian \r\nsystem — one with a common humanity at the centre, \r\nbacked by substantive action and political will. \r\nMillions of suffering people depend upon us. We must \r\nnow deliver on those commitments. Australia stands \r\nready to heed that call, and we ask all Member States \r\nto join us.\r\nMrs. Rodríguez Abascal (Cuba) (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Humanitarian assistance must be provided at \r\nthe request and with the consent of the affected State, \r\nsince the latter plays the main role in coordinating all \r\nhumanitarian activities in its territory. In that respect, \r\nCuba recognizes the full validity of the guiding principles \r\nof humanitarian assistance endorsed by the General \r\nAssembly in resolution 46/182. It is the obligation of \r\nMember States and the United Nations to ensure that \r\nhumanitarian assistance is provided in accordance with \r\nthe principles of humanity, neutrality and impartiality. \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 17/26\r\nWe therefore reject the double standards that hide under \r\nthe noble mantle of humanitarian efforts.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations must be \r\nrespected, and its purposes and principles must not be \r\nviolated, distorted, restricted or subjected to conditions \r\nwhen humanitarian assistance is provided. In that \r\nregard, we oppose the endorsement of concepts that \r\nhave not been agreed and are ambiguous in order to \r\njustify actions that are contrary to the principles of \r\nsovereignty, territorial integrity and non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of States.\r\nTo the human and material damage caused by \r\nnatural disasters, we must add those disasters with \r\ndirect human causes, such as hunger, poverty and war, \r\nwhich place billions of people in extremely precarious \r\nsituations throughout the world.\r\nAs an urgent matter, we must strengthen \r\ninternational cooperation programmes and transfer \r\nresources, technologies and knowledge to developing \r\ncountries in order to complement their national \r\ncapacities in the face of humanitarian emergencies. \r\nThat international cooperation must be carried out in \r\naccordance with the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and without preconditions.\r\nCuba believes that humanitarian assistance in \r\nemergency situations must contribute to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of the affected State. It must therefore \r\nalso address the root causes that limit the ability of \r\ncountries to prevent, mitigate and address the various \r\nhumanitarian emergencies in their territories, especially \r\nthose generated by inequality, the unjust international \r\neconomic order, poverty, underdevelopment and the \r\ninstigation and maintenance of armed conflicts from \r\noutside. It is also important to ensure that responses \r\nto humanitarian emergencies do not have a detrimental \r\neffect on the commitments made with respect to \r\nactivities, programmes and resources earmarked \r\nfor development.\r\nThe Cuban Government’s experience and central \r\nrole in initiating, organizing, coordinating and \r\ndelivering humanitarian assistance to countries affected \r\nby natural disasters are well known. Our experience \r\ndemonstrates the need for a civil defence system that \r\nintegrates all of a society’s institutions and resources \r\nfor the protection of individuals, their assets and the \r\nsocioeconomic infrastructure. Cuba has been working \r\non updating institutional and normative frameworks \r\nfor disaster-risk reduction at the local level as part of \r\nimproving its national and local early-warning systems \r\nand organizing response and recovery actions.\r\nThe benefits of our experience are tangible. In spite \r\nof the substantial material losses left in the wake of the \r\nrecent passing of Hurricane Matthew, our country is \r\ngoing about its recovery efforts calmly and proudly, \r\nstrengthened by the knowledge that we have not had to \r\nmourn the loss of a single human life. We are thankful \r\nfor the solidarity and assistance that we received.\r\nIn connection with subparagraph (b) of agenda \r\nitem 69, my delegation would like to reiterate its \r\nunconditional support for the heroic efforts of the \r\nPalestinians in their fight to exercise their inalienable \r\nright to self-determination. The Palestinian people is \r\nthe victim of one of the longest-lasting humanitarian \r\nemergencies the Organization has known, and \r\ntherefore requires require particular attention in this \r\ndebate. It is imperative to redouble efforts to end the \r\ninjustice committed against that people and to resolve \r\nthe question of Palestine in all its aspects, including \r\nby providing a just solution to the difficult situation \r\nof refugees.\r\nCuba reiterates its willingness to continue to \r\nextend its support, in solidarity and with impartiality, \r\nto countries affected by natural disasters or \r\nother emergencies.\r\nMr. Al-Malki (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset I wish to extend my thanks and appreciation to \r\nthe President of the General Assembly for convening \r\nthis meeting to shed light on United Nations efforts \r\nto strengthen its coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance, particularly in the light of the \r\nescalating humanitarian needs and suffering.\r\nIn recent years the world has witnessed protracted \r\ncrises, acts of violence, armed conflicts and numerous \r\nnatural disasters. In 2015, 346 natural disasters were \r\nrecorded, each causing thousands of victims. Their \r\nrepercussions affected millions of persons, according \r\nto the report (A/71/395) of the Secretary-General on \r\nthe agenda item before us. The complex conditions gave \r\nrise to untold humanitarian suffering and numerous \r\nchallenges, evident in the unprecedented levels of forced \r\ndisplacements and the growing numbers of persons \r\nin need of humanitarian assistance. That situation \r\nhas overwhelmed the United Nations and all partners \r\nconcerned in their efforts to deal with developmental \r\nand humanitarian challenges, coordinate humanitarian \r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n18/26 16-42340\r\naction and extend assistance, particularly given the lack \r\nof requisite funding.\r\nWe would like to acknowledge the very important \r\nrole played by the Central Emergency Response Fund \r\nin meeting growing humanitarian needs. We take \r\nthis opportunity to note that the State of Qatar has \r\ncontributed to the Fund, which is one of the most \r\nsuccessful tools of global humanitarian funding. Given \r\nthe pressing need to meet the unprecedented level of \r\nhumanitarian needs, the World Humanitarian Summit, \r\nheld in Istanbul, took on a unique character. It was \r\nan important opportunity to press ahead with finding \r\nsolutions to humanitarian crises, in the light of the \r\njoint responsibilities of States. In that regard, we draw \r\nattention to the conclusions of the negotiations leading \r\nto the Summit, concerning a new method of work that \r\nmeets people’s needs as a means to curb risk.\r\nThe State of Qatar has always interacted and \r\ncooperated with the international community in \r\novercoming all the obstacles to a stable and safe \r\nworld, a world that benefits from internationally \r\nagreed commitments, particularly the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and the principle of leaving no one \r\nbehind. We wish to emphasize that there is no alternative \r\nto cooperation and joint action if humankind is to enjoy \r\nthe rule of law, respect for human rights and reduced \r\nvulnerabilities and risks. In keeping with the principled \r\ntenets of our domestic and foreign policies, and given \r\nthe pressing need to ease the suffering of millions \r\nof people, we have been at the forefront of States in \r\npromoting international peace and security through our \r\ndiplomatic efforts and model relations — regionally \r\nand internationally — to settle disputes peacefully, \r\nparticularly in the Arab region.\r\nWe are cooperating with United Nations agencies \r\nin the Gaza Strip, as we believe in the importance of \r\naddressing the humanitarian situation in Gaza and \r\nachieving peace. We will continue our humanitarian \r\nefforts to rebuild the Gaza Strip and achieve stability \r\nthere. In that connection, the schools of Sheikh Hamad \r\nbin Khalifa Al Thani were recently set up in Hamad \r\ncity, in southern Gaza. We emphasize the need for \r\nintegrity and impartiality. We shall remain a truly \r\nreliable partner in humanitarian response efforts, with \r\na view to reversing unacceptable trends and improving \r\nthe livelihoods of people throughout the world.\r\nMs. Mendelson (United States of America): The \r\nUnited States wishes to reaffirm its strong support \r\nfor the United Nations leadership in humanitarian \r\nassistance. We will remember 2016 for the renewed \r\ncommitment to efficient, effective and well-coordinated \r\nhumanitarian response that Member States and United \r\nNations humanitarian leaders made during the World \r\nHumanitarian Summit, the General Assembly high-level \r\nmeeting on addressing large movements of refugees \r\nand migrants and the leaders summit on refugees.\r\nIn the New York Declaration for Refugees and \r\nMigrants, Member States renewed their commitment \r\nto protecting and assisting refugees and vulnerable \r\nmigrants in a period of unprecedented displacement. \r\nWe welcome the Declaration’s call for the development \r\nof global compacts on refugees and safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration. However, as we look back on 2016, \r\nwe are also haunted by our inability to bring conflict \r\nto an end and to reach people in need in places such as \r\nSyria, Yemen, the Lake Chad basin and South Sudan. \r\nAt the end of 2015, a total of 65.3 million people were \r\ndisplaced as a result of violence, conflict or persecution, \r\ncompared with 59.5 million just 12 months earlier.\r\nIn that context, humanitarian assistance that allows \r\nus to address basic needs and protection, including \r\nmitigating risks associated with human trafficking, \r\nhas never been more important. Indeed, as the Syrian \r\nregime continues to prevent thousands of its citizens \r\nfrom accessing humanitarian assistance, we are \r\nreminded of the limitations of our efforts in the absence \r\nof respect for international humanitarian law.\r\nThe United States welcomes the adoption later \r\ntoday of the omnibus humanitarian draft resolution \r\n(A/71/L.32), as well as the draft resolution on the safety \r\nand security of United Nations humanitarian personnel \r\n(A/71/L.34) and the draft resolution on natural disasters \r\n(A/71/L.33), and is pleased to co-sponsor them. The \r\nomnibus text represents a positive step forward by \r\nstrengthening the humanitarian community’s ability \r\nto better address the humanitarian assistance needs of \r\nmore than 100 million people around the globe. It also \r\ndemonstrates the determination of many Member States \r\nto turn words into action, including the commitments \r\nmade at the World Humanitarian Summit.\r\n The omnibus draft resolution calls on the United \r\nNations to improve humanitarian coordination \r\nthrough the development of prioritized humanitarian \r\nresponse plans, based on needs assessments. It calls for \r\nincreased transparency, the reduction of duplication in \r\nthe system and the strengthening of partnerships with \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 19/26\r\nnational and local responders. It also advances new \r\nways of working through important language about \r\nreducing the humanitarian and development silos, and, \r\nfor the first time, it stresses the importance of United \r\nNations efforts to combat sexual exploitation and abuse \r\ncommitted by aid workers.\r\nI would like to draw attention to the omnibus draft \r\nresolution’s focus on the needs of internally displaced \r\npersons (IDPs), who represent over two thirds of those \r\nforcibly displaced worldwide. The text renews the \r\ncall on Governments to uphold their responsibility \r\nto provide protection and assistance to IDPs and \r\nrefugees, critically define durable solutions and further \r\nstrengthen international response efforts. It also \r\ndraws our attention to the importance of supporting \r\ncommunities that host IDPs and refugees. The omnibus \r\ndraft resolution affirms that international humanitarian \r\nlaw provides for the protection of civilians in all armed \r\nconflicts, international and non-international. We regret \r\nthat Syria broke silence after the extensive, inclusive \r\nand transparent negotiations had ended — negotiations \r\nin which its delegation participated. Serious last-minute \r\nobstructionism is inconsistent with the spirit of open \r\ndebate and compromise, which is a long-standing part \r\nof this organ’s working methods, at a time when Syria \r\nhas already lost its credibility by waging a campaign \r\nthat includes sieges, the blocking of humanitarian aid, \r\nthe indiscriminate bombardment of civilian areas and \r\nthe use of barrel bombs.\r\nWe also recognize the vital contribution of \r\nthe safety and security and natural disasters draft \r\nresolutions to the overall framework for the delivery of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. Risks to the safety and well-\r\nbeing of the brave men and women working on the \r\nfront line to assist people in need, particularly local and \r\nnational staff, have continued to increase, and 2016 has \r\nbeen marred by attacks on relief convoys and medical \r\nfacilities, as well as brutal acts of sexual assault on \r\naid workers.\r\nIn that context, United Nations efforts to protect \r\nfront-line relief workers remain critical, and the focus \r\nof draft resolution A/71/L.34 and its addendum 1 on the \r\nresponsibilities of all parties to armed conflict under \r\ninternational humanitarian law to provide protection \r\nhas never been more important. Similarly, we renew the \r\ncommitment of the United States, in close partnership \r\nwith the international community, including the United \r\nNations system, to working with affected communities \r\nand civil society to prepare for, respond to and reduce \r\nthe risk of natural disasters through our humanitarian \r\nand development assistance. We welcome the adoption \r\nof the draft resolution in that regard later today.\r\nThe United States looks forward to working with \r\nthe United Nations and Member States in 2017 to \r\nfurther improve humanitarian planning and assistance, \r\nand to work tirelessly to uphold international \r\nhumanitarian law in all armed conflicts. As we reflect \r\non the immense need for financial support, outlined \r\nin the global humanitarian appeal for 2017, we urge \r\nall Member States to contribute generously to United \r\nNations humanitarian appeals and agencies, as well as \r\nto other key international humanitarian organizations. \r\nWe thank Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his \r\nextraordinary leadership on humanitarian affairs \r\nduring his tenure, and we look forward to supporting \r\nAntónio Guterres as he opens a new chapter in the \r\nUnited Nations history of offering hope, protection and \r\nassistance to those in need.\r\nMr. Wu Haitao (China) (spoke in Chinese): \r\nIntertwined traditional and non-traditional security \r\nthreats, protracted and regional conflicts in some \r\nplaces, natural disasters, climate change, food crises, \r\nrefugee and migrant issues and other global challenges \r\nhave come to the fore in recent years, resulting in a \r\ngenerally grim international humanitarian situation. It \r\nis vital that the international community be united, build \r\nconsensus, address both the symptoms and underlying \r\ncauses of problems and take effective measures to \r\nrespond to that increasingly grave humanitarian \r\nsituation. In that connection, China would like to \r\nemphasize the following points.\r\nFirst, respect for international law and the \r\nnorms governing international relations is the basic \r\nprecondition for effective humanitarian assistance. \r\nSuch assistance must abide by the Charter of the United \r\nNations, while strictly adhering to the principles of \r\nhumanity, neutrality and impartiality, and must respect \r\nthe sovereignty, independence, territorial integrity and \r\nnational unity of recipient countries. It must comply \r\nwith international law and the laws of host countries. \r\nThe international community should make every effort \r\nto resolve disputes peacefully through political means, \r\navoid politicizing humanitarian issues and uphold the \r\nnon-military nature of humanitarian assistance.\r\nSecondly, assisting developing countries in their \r\ndevelopment is a fundamental way to reduce the need \r\nfor humanitarian aid. Many problems in the world today \r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n20/26 16-42340\r\nare rooted in poverty and underdevelopment and should \r\nbe resolved fundamentally by promoting development. \r\nWhile seeking to respond effectively to short-term \r\nhumanitarian needs, the international community should \r\njointly implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment to achieve development. Humanitarian \r\nresources should not be increased at the expense \r\nof resources allocated to development. Developed \r\ncountries should effectively fulfil their commitments \r\nwith regard to official development assistance, and \r\nshould make a point of increasing their support to \r\nAfrican countries and least developed countries in the \r\nareas of capital, technology and capacity-building so \r\nas to help developing countries embark upon a path to \r\nlasting peace, stability, development and prosperity.\r\nThirdly, factors such as climate change and food \r\ninsecurity have aggravated the risk of natural disasters \r\nand our vulnerability to them. At the same time, the \r\nrapid development of information and communication \r\ntechnologies has greatly improved our capacity to \r\nprevent and respond to catastrophic events. Operating \r\nwith full respect for the situation and the needs of \r\ncountries affected by disasters, and using means \r\nsuch as increasing investment in and the transfer of \r\ntechnologies and know-how to developing countries \r\nand enhancing their infrastructure construction, the \r\ninternational community should be able to effectively \r\nenhance the capacity of countries dealing with disasters \r\nto manage disaster risks and to build capacity for \r\npreventing, reducing, preparing for and responding to \r\nsuch disasters, as well as working to build resilience.\r\nFourthly, the efficient operation of the United \r\nNations humanitarian system is an important guarantee \r\nof the effective delivery of humanitarian assistance. \r\nIn accordance with its mandate, the Office for the \r\nCoordination of Humanitarian Affairs should continue \r\nits important role in coordinating such aid, establishing \r\nand improving cooperative partnerships led by Member \r\nStates, ensuring all countries’ equal participation \r\nand increasing developing countries’ representation \r\nand voice in international humanitarian affairs. The \r\nprovision of humanitarian assistance should be based on \r\nthe actual needs and priorities of recipient Governments \r\nand peoples, with a view to promoting synergy at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels.\r\nChina attaches great importance to and takes an \r\nactive part in international humanitarian assistance. \r\nWe have provided emergency humanitarian aid to \r\ndozens of countries in recent years, and as our capacity \r\npermits, we will continue to participate actively in \r\nbilateral and multilateral humanitarian assistance and \r\nmake new contributions to the cause of international \r\nhumanitarian affairs. China is a country where natural \r\ndisasters occur frequently. While continuing to increase \r\nits own capacity to cope with disasters, the Chinese \r\nGovernment is actively engaged in international \r\ncooperation for disaster reduction. We have established \r\nand improved international cooperation mechanisms \r\nfor disaster reduction and are a major participant \r\nin international disaster reduction and assistance \r\nprogrammes. China will continue to work to deepen \r\ninternational cooperation and exchanges to build \r\nsynergies with the international community, with a \r\nview to jointly enhancing our capacities for disaster \r\nprevention, reduction and relief.\r\nMr. Roet (Israel): More than 130 million \r\npeople around the world today are in urgent need of \r\nhumanitarian assistance. The scale of the problem is \r\nstaggering, as the human suffering is greater than at \r\nany time since the Second World War. Now more than \r\never, it is crucial that Member States, non-governmental \r\norganizations (NGOs), the private sector and all \r\nrelevant agencies coordinate an effective humanitarian \r\nresponse so that we can better deliver for people around \r\nthe globe. This year, world leaders convened in Istanbul \r\nat the first-ever World Humanitarian Summit, where \r\nthey established a way forward for a collective response \r\nto future humanitarian challenges. It is now time to \r\nimplement what we all agreed to.\r\nThe year 2016 has been one of devastating \r\nhumanitarian crises — conflicts, natural disasters, \r\nepidemics and sectarian fighting — that have left \r\nmillions dead and millions more in dire conditions, \r\nlacking any way to meet even the most basic of \r\nhuman needs.\r\nAs I stand here, Syria continues to bleed. The \r\nviolence inflicted by the Al-Assad regime, which \r\nbrutally assaults its own people using conventional and \r\nnon-conventional weapons, has plunged the country \r\ninto the worst humanitarian crisis in the history of \r\nthe Middle East. The carnage has claimed the lives of \r\nmore than 400,000 people, including tens of thousands \r\nof children, and has displaced approximately half of \r\nthe Syrian population. Nowhere is the situation more \r\ngrave than in Aleppo, where collapsing infrastructure \r\nand a lack of basic provisions, including food, water \r\nand medicine, have led to a humanitarian catastrophe \r\nof unimaginable scale. With winter approaching, the \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 21/26\r\nsituation in devastated Aleppo is getting worse by the \r\nday, and urgent action is needed.\r\nIn Yemen, a country ravaged by war, we are \r\nwitnessing the constant deterioration of one of the \r\nlargest humanitarian crises in the world. Continuous \r\nand indiscriminate attacks by the Saudi-led coalition \r\nand the Iranian-backed Houthi rebels continue to take \r\na deadly toll on the civilian population. The numbers \r\nare staggering. Today, 80 per cent of the population of \r\nYemen — as many as 21 million people — is in need of \r\nsome form of humanitarian assistance.\r\nIn the Central African Republic, a conflict that has \r\ndragged on for three years has affected nearly the entire \r\npopulation and has left some 2.3 million people, more \r\nthan half the population, in urgent need of assistance.\r\nWhile humankind, unfortunately, continues to \r\ncause misery, nature has not rested. Natural disasters \r\ncontinue to put millions of people at risk every year. \r\nWhile we cannot control nature, we can and should do \r\nbetter in preparing for disasters before they happen and \r\nin responding quickly and efficiently when they do. The \r\nmost recent El Niño has affected more than 60 million \r\npeople all over the world, and many vulnerable groups \r\nare among the worst affected, including women, \r\nchildren and people with disabilities. Alarmingly, food \r\ninsecurity linked to crop failure and drought is expected \r\nto peak during 2017. In Haiti, Hurricane Matthew left \r\nmore than 175,000 people homeless, while the United \r\nNations estimates that at least 1.4 million Haitians are \r\nin need of urgent humanitarian assistance. That has also \r\nhad an effect on the country’s ability to respond to its \r\ncholera epidemic, which threatens to worsen after many \r\ntreatment centres were destroyed in the hurricane.\r\nFrom early in its existence, Israel has been committed \r\nto providing humanitarian aid, whenever and wherever \r\nit is needed. In 1958, the State of Israel adopted an \r\nofficial humanitarian aid agenda as a principal element \r\nof the country’s international cooperation efforts. \r\nNowadays, Israel is often called on to dispatch aid in the \r\nwake of earthquakes, f loods, famine and other natural \r\ndisasters. Following the devastating tropical cyclone \r\nthat did severe damage in Fiji earlier this year, Israel \r\nwas among the first countries to dispatch an aid mission \r\nto rebuild the remote village of Vuma, destroyed in the \r\nstorm. This summer, MASHAV, Israel’s international \r\ndevelopment cooperation agency, provided emergency \r\nprotective equipment to Cameroon to help fight the \r\nspread of a bird-f lu epidemic affecting the country. In \r\nApril, following a devastating earthquake in Ecuador, \r\nMASHAV sent medical aid and supplies to the affected \r\nareas. A group of Israeli doctors set up a mobile clinic in \r\nCanoa, one of the worst-affected areas in the province \r\nof Manabi.\r\nAddressing today’s humanitarian challenges \r\nrequires coordinated action on the part of Governments, \r\nNGOs and other relevant actors. In that regard, \r\nIsrael commends the important work being done by \r\nhumanitarian NGOs all over the world. One of them \r\nis IsraAID, an Israeli NGO committed to providing \r\nlifesaving disaster relief and long-term support. For \r\nmore than a decade, its teams of professional medics, \r\nsearch-and-rescue squads, post-trauma experts and \r\ncommunity mobilizers have been on the front lines \r\nof nearly every major humanitarian response in the \r\ntwenty-first century. Those efforts represent the spirit \r\nof our people and the character of our nation.\r\nAs we have seen time and time again, economic \r\nprosperity and development lead to stability, and \r\nstability leads to security. The economic growth and \r\nwell-being of the Palestinian people are therefore in \r\nIsrael’s direct interests, and Israel is a committed \r\npartner on that path. Despite the onslaught of the terror \r\nattacks on Israelis that have been going on for more \r\nthan a century, and which have increased in the past \r\ntwo years, and despite the constant threats posed to \r\nour citizens by rocket attacks from Hamas-controlled \r\nGaza, we have continued with our efforts to improve \r\nthe well-being of the Palestinian people, in the West \r\nBank, in Judaea and Samaria, and in the Gaza Strip. \r\nToday I would therefore like to share with the Assembly \r\nsome facts that are rarely heard in this Hall.\r\nIsrael is cooperating closely with the United Nations \r\nin facilitating Gaza’s reconstruction through the Gaza \r\nReconstruction Mechanism. Since October 2014, Israel \r\nhas enabled the entrance of more than 6 million tons \r\nof construction materials into the Gaza Strip. Every \r\nday, 800 trucks go through the Kerem Shalom and \r\nErez crossings into the Strip. As we speak, Israel is \r\ninvesting millions of dollars to upgrade that capacity to \r\n1,000 trucks a day. More than 100,000 residential units \r\nhave been refurbished and hundreds of public projects, \r\nincluding schools, clinics, mosques and parks, are near \r\ncompletion. Israel is also addressing critical energy \r\nand water needs in the Gaza Strip. Our Government \r\nhas approved the construction of a high-voltage electric \r\nline that, once operational, will supply Gaza with an \r\nadditional 100 megawatts of electricity. In the near \r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n22/26 16-42340\r\nterm we will also add 10 million cubic metres of water \r\nto the Gaza Strip’s water system, effectively doubling \r\nthe quantity of potable water currently supplied to Gaza\r\nDespite all of those efforts, the full reconstruction \r\nof Gaza is constantly hindered by the actions of \r\nHamas, which is internationally recognized as a terror \r\norganization. Hamas regularly confiscates, diverts \r\nand smuggles resources intended for the humanitarian \r\ndevelopment needs of Gaza residents and redirects \r\nthem for its own priorities — digging terror tunnels, \r\nbuilding training camps and manufacturing rockets. \r\nThat is an organization that is known to have exploited \r\nhumanitarian agencies in order to divert materials for \r\nits military buildup, and yet too many United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies — the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East \r\nis one example — shy away from blaming Hamas, and \r\noften even from mentioning it by name.\r\nIt seems that making political declarations \r\nand criticizing only one side is always easier than \r\nconcentrating on the humanitarian tasks facing us. \r\nIsrael views with the utmost severity the exploitation \r\nof well-intentioned NGOs and international funds as \r\nfunnels for terror tunnels. It should be clear that, as we \r\nwork for Gaza’s recovery, there should be zero tolerance \r\nfor any type of abuse, zero tolerance for terrorism, zero \r\ntolerance for terrorism financing and zero tolerance \r\nfor violence.\r\nThis year we witnessed the signing of a major \r\nagreement resolving a decade-long dispute over the \r\nPalestinian Authority’s debt to the Israel Electric \r\nCorporation. It represents nothing less than a \r\nbreakthrough that will ensure a consistent supply \r\nof electricity to the Palestinian population and full \r\npayment for future consumption, and that will return \r\nresponsibility for managing the Palestinian energy \r\nmarket to the Palestinian Authority. That important \r\nachievement demonstrates the great potential of direct \r\nbilateral dialogue between Israel and the Palestinian \r\nAuthority without preconditions.\r\nIf the Assembly is surprised that it has not yet \r\nheard about that achievement accomplished by the \r\ntwo sides, that is because positive news is not part of \r\nthe anti-Israeli narrative that is sometimes promoted \r\nat the United Nations. In fact, any mention of it was \r\nintentionally omitted from a resolution adopted here \r\nrecently. Nevertheless, Israel remains committed \r\nto supplying humanitarian aid and assistance to the \r\nPalestinian people. But humanitarian efforts alone \r\nwill not bring peace and prosperity, either to Israelis \r\nor Palestinians. We call on the Palestinian Authority to \r\ntake a constructive approach and accept our repeated \r\ncalls to resume direct negotiations.\r\nThe Talmud tells us that when someone saves a life, \r\nit is as if he had saved an entire world. Let us continue \r\nto save life after life, until the whole world becomes a \r\nsafer, more peaceful place. The cost of taking action is \r\nhigh, but the price for not taking action is even higher. \r\nWe must continue to form global partnerships in order \r\nto address, mitigate and prevent future humanitarian \r\ncrises around the world.\r\nMr. AlJarallah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): I am \r\nvery pleased to be taking part in today’s consideration \r\nof this important agenda item. We highly commend the \r\nrole that has been played by Stephen O’Brien, Under-\r\nSecretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs, and his \r\nentire team in the efforts in this area, which send a \r\nmessage of support for international humanitarian \r\nwork. We welcome this review of the resolutions aimed \r\nat strengthening the coordination of humanitarian and \r\ndisaster relief assistance. We have also carefully studied \r\nand taken into consideration the report (A/71/395) of \r\nthe Secretary-General on the subject.\r\nMy delegation would like to emphasize the \r\nimportance of the first World Humanitarian Summit, \r\nheld in Istanbul in May. It represents a turning point in \r\nour collective humanitarian process and a significant \r\nbasis for enhancing international efforts by coming up \r\nwith new ways to find solutions to the problems facing \r\nthe world. In that regard, we would also like to emphasize \r\nthe significance of the Secretary-General’s report \r\n(A/71/353) on the outcome of the World Humanitarian \r\nSummit, which underlines the importance of collective \r\nefforts in the service of humankind in the phrase “One \r\nhumanity: shared responsibility”.\r\nWe have given serious consideration to the \r\nideas in the Secretary-General’s report (A/71/336) \r\non the Central Emergency Response Fund for 2015, \r\nwhich emphasizes the importance of redoubling and \r\nintensifying the international community’s efforts \r\nand broadening the Fund’s donor base. Kuwait firmly \r\nbelieves that it is important to respond to those appeals. \r\nWe have therefore taken initiatives in that regard, \r\nincluding, in 2014, earmarking $1 million as a voluntary \r\ncontribution, based on our country’s belief in the role \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 23/26\r\nbeing played by the United Nations in humanitarian \r\naffairs and assistance.\r\nI would like to recall that the report (A/71/87) of \r\nthe Secretary-General on assistance to the Palestinian \r\npeople stresses the importance of strengthening United \r\nNations assistance to Palestinian institutions and of \r\ncontributing to the 2016 humanitarian response plan \r\nto bolster the programmes to meet the immediate \r\nhumanitarian needs of the brotherly Palestinian people \r\nand for recovery and reconstruction throughout the \r\noccupied Palestinian territory. The report also mentions \r\nunprecedented losses and damage due to the destruction \r\ncaused by Israeli occupation and aggression.\r\nWe want to reaffirm the need to work collectively in \r\norder to achieve lasting, viable, fair and comprehensive \r\npeace in the Middle East. We would also like to stress the \r\nimportance of pursuing meaningful political initiatives \r\nto compel Israel to respond to and respect international \r\nresolutions on upholding the legitimate rights of the \r\nPalestinian people, including by recognizing Palestine \r\nas an independent State, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, within the pre-1967 borders, in line with the \r\nprinciple of land for peace, the road map and the Arab \r\nPeace Initiative.\r\nKuwait firmly believes in the collective efforts to \r\nsurmount the challenges facing the world today. The \r\nchallenges cannot be overcome by one State or one \r\nentity alone; they require collective responsibility \r\nand efforts. Since independence, we have sought to \r\nprovide assistance to countries in need, irrespective \r\nof geographic, ethnic or religious affiliations. We \r\nhave continued our humanitarian efforts for stricken \r\ncountries. Over the past five years, we have provided \r\nmore than $2 billion for humanitarian assistance alone.\r\nWe are proud to be at the top of the 2014-2015 \r\nlist of contributions to humanitarian assistance as a \r\nproportion of a country’s national income, according \r\nto international statistics, as well as top of the list of \r\ndonor countries that are participating in the search for \r\nsolutions to all the crises plaguing our region, including \r\nin Palestine, Syria, Yemen and Iraq. That has put \r\nKuwait at the centre of humanitarian efforts. Indeed, \r\nthe United Nations has given His Highness the Amir \r\nof Kuwait the Global Humanitarian Leadership Award \r\nin acknowledgement of Kuwait’s efforts in this area. \r\nWe have continued to acknowledge the importance of \r\ndevelopment assistance, providing 2.1 per cent of our \r\nnational income for that purpose last year — twice the \r\namount agreed upon. We also allocated $15 billion for \r\nthe next 15 years as assistance to generate infrastructure \r\nprojects in developing and least developed countries.\r\nIn conclusion, my country’s delegation would like \r\nto stress the importance of collective international \r\nefforts and of building on those of the United Nations, \r\nthe suitable forum for addressing international \r\nhumanitarian needs and crises, which pose a major \r\nchallenge to the achievement of global peace \r\nand security.\r\nMr. Tsymbaliuk (Ukraine): During the past \r\ndecade, the international community has witnessed \r\nhumanitarian crises of unprecedented scale and \r\ncomplexity, along with an ever-increasing need for \r\nimmediate responses to emergency situations. The \r\nyear 2016 is a vivid example of the global humanitarian \r\nfunding requirements, which surpassed $22 billion, to \r\nmeet the needs of almost 100 million people, including \r\nmore than 65 million people who were forced from their \r\nhomes. Such circumstances require the acceleration of \r\ncommon efforts for a smoother transition from relief \r\nto recovery and development, in accordance with \r\nthe principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality \r\nand interdependence.\r\nUkraine highly values the work of United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies and partners to improve \r\nhumanitarian response capacities, strengthen the \r\nresilience of affected communities and restore their \r\nself-reliance. We emphasize the importance of the \r\nrelevant reports and resolutions aimed at shaping a \r\nglobal framework for the delivery of emergency relief.\r\nClear examples of the disastrous events of 2016 are \r\nHurricane Matthew tearing through Haiti, the Bahamas \r\nand Cuba; natural disasters in the Asia-Pacific region; \r\nand protracted conflicts in Syria, South Sudan and \r\nYemen; as well as extreme weather events fuelled by \r\nEl Niño. They pointed to the paramount importance of \r\nstrengthening the funding of efforts to overcome the \r\nconsequences of such disasters, in particular through \r\nthe Central Emergency Response Fund (CERF). \r\nGiven recent developments, there is a need to increase \r\nCERF funding to facilitate the delivery of its mandate \r\nin providing timely and needs-based humanitarian \r\nassistance in line with the commitments pledged during \r\nthis year’s World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul.\r\nWhile Ukraine shares the view that national \r\nauthorities bear the primary responsibility to provide \r\nhumanitarian assistance, the serious humanitarian \r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n24/26 16-42340\r\nchallenges we have confronted demonstrate that \r\ninternational cooperation is invaluable in situations \r\nthat exceed national coping capabilities. Therefore, \r\nUkraine calls for continued and enhanced international \r\nsupport, upon request, for the capacity-building efforts \r\nof States. To maximize efficiency, humanitarian \r\nassistance should address not only the needs, but also \r\nthe factors that contribute to vulnerability.\r\nWe also share the idea of creating a common \r\nsystem that would connect humanitarian aid agencies \r\nand bodies around the world at the national, regional \r\nand global levels in order to improve communication \r\namong them and help them achieve efficiency in \r\ndelivering help to affected populations on short notice. \r\nSuch a system would greatly facilitate the work of \r\nhumanitarian personnel worldwide.\r\nIn that regard, we would like to underline the \r\nresponsibility of Member States to ensure the security \r\nof United Nations and humanitarian personnel. \r\nTherefore, we fully support the idea of strengthening \r\ncooperation between host countries and the United \r\nNations on that matter. It also concerns the promotion of \r\nsafe and unhindered access of humanitarian personnel \r\nto affected populations, in particular in situations of \r\narmed conflict\r\nUkraine, too, has been facing enormous \r\nhumanitarian challenges because of the Russian \r\naggression. It has resulted in the increase of internally \r\ndisplaced persons in the territory of Ukraine to nearly \r\n1.8 million people. The Government of Ukraine is doing \r\nits best in continuing to respond to this challenge, both \r\nat the institutional and legislative levels. Coordination \r\nmechanisms have been established and new legislation \r\non internally displaced persons (IDPs) and relevant \r\nsublegislative acts have been adopted, facilitating \r\nIDPs’ access to their pensions, social benefits, medical \r\ncare, employment and education. We witnessed United \r\nNations humanitarian aid help thousands of Ukrainians \r\nfrom affected areas in the eastern part of the country, \r\nproviding food, supplies and medical assistance since \r\nthe beginning of the crisis.\r\nThis year also marked the thirtieth anniversary \r\nof the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl. That notorious \r\ntragedy was the worst nuclear power plant accident in \r\nhistory in terms of cost and casualties. In cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations Development Programme, \r\nserious efforts have been made towards the restoration \r\nof affected communities, self-reliance and self-\r\nsufficiency, all based on the development approach. \r\nIn order to decrease nuclear contamination from \r\nthe Chernobyl disaster, on 29 November, Ukraine \r\ncompleted the installation of the arched shelter over the \r\nChernobyl nuclear power plant. We would like to thank \r\nour international partners that contributed to funding \r\nand assisting in finalizing that project.\r\nI would like to end my statement with a famous \r\nEnglish proverb: a friend in need is a friend indeed. Let \r\nus therefore not leave other countries to face serious \r\nchallenges alone. We ought to respond to them as a \r\nunited world.\r\nMs. Schwalger (New Zealand): The humanitarian \r\nsegment of the General Assembly is usually an \r\nopportunity for Member States to reflect on the \r\nhumanitarian challenges of the preceding year and to \r\nexpress hope for the year to come. Looking back at \r\n2016, it is difficult to be optimistic. As noted by others \r\nthis morning, the humanitarian need facing the world \r\nis greater today than any time since the Second World \r\nWar. Humanitarian appeals are at an all-time high, as \r\nare violations of international humanitarian law.\r\nDecember is the final month of New Zealand’s \r\ncurrent term on the Security Council. If we apply a \r\nhumanitarian lens, the conflict in Syria has dominated \r\nour term. No other ongoing conflict has taken a \r\nheavier toll on its civilian population. We were bitterly \r\ndisappointed at the Security Council’s inability this week \r\nto adopt a draft resolution that would have reduced the \r\nfighting and allowed desperately needed humanitarian \r\naid to reach the more than 250,000 civilians trapped \r\nin Aleppo. The draft resolution — put forward by \r\nEgypt, Spain and New Zealand — represented, in our \r\nview, a minimum credible response from the Council. \r\nMonday’s veto (see S/PV.7825) made clear that military \r\ngains trumped preserving the lives of men, women and \r\nchildren. However, we have not given up. New Zealand \r\nwill continue our work in the Security Council and in \r\nthe General Assembly to protect Syrian civilians and to \r\nfind a solution to what has become the gravest and most \r\ncomplex humanitarian catastrophe of our time.\r\nWe were deeply disappointed by the politicization \r\nof the humanitarian omnibus negotiations. A small \r\nnumber of Member States opposed the inclusion of \r\nlanguage that expressed concern at the obstruction \r\nof humanitarian aid by parties to armed conflict. \r\nUnconstructive negotiation tactics were also employed, \r\nsuch as using the silence procedure to force concessions. \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.56\r\n16-42340 25/26\r\nWhile reaching consensus is important, we believe \r\nthat we are paying an increasingly high price for such \r\nconcessions. That is especially true when the issue \r\nis as pressing as providing life-saving humanitarian \r\nassistance and when there are numerous voices in \r\nsupport and very few in opposition.\r\nIn May, the Security Council unanimously \r\nadopted resolution 2286 (2016). For the first time, \r\nthe Council came together to strongly condemn the \r\ntargeting of hospitals and health-care workers in \r\narmed conflict. New Zealand and four other elected \r\nmembers of the Council — Spain, Egypt, Uruguay \r\nand Japan — shepherded that landmark resolution. \r\nWe are proud of the inclusive process that led to its \r\nadoption. Key humanitarian stakeholders, such as the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross, Médecins \r\nsans Frontières and United Nations agencies, were \r\nconsulted throughout its negotiations. Resolution 2286 \r\n(2016) was adopted by consensus, with more than 80 \r\nMember States sponsoring it.\r\nWhat has become clear in recent months, however, \r\nis that resolution 2286 (2016) is being blatantly ignored. \r\nIn Aleppo, Syria, there are no functioning hospitals left. \r\nIn Abs, Yemen, a Médecins sans Frontières hospital \r\nwas destroyed by an airstrike in August. The list goes \r\non. The lack of political will to implement resolution \r\n2286 (2016) is difficult to fathom. We strongly urge all \r\nMember States to implement resolution 2286 (2016), \r\nand we urge all parties to armed conflicts to fully \r\ncomply with their obligations under international law. \r\nIn that regard, the International Criminal Court plays an \r\nimportant role in bringing to justice those responsible \r\nfor serious violations of international humanitarian \r\nlaw. There is a fundamental principle at stake: those \r\nbreaching international humanitarian law must be \r\nheld accountable.\r\nAt the same time, our experience on the Security \r\nCouncil has made it clear that greater resources must \r\nbe invested in conflict prevention. New Zealand is \r\nconvinced that we must do better than waiting until a \r\nconflict has already arisen. We must move away from \r\nhearing predictable, rote rehearsals of national positions. \r\nThat is why New Zealand has tried to implement a \r\nculture in which the Council engages early, swiftly and \r\npragmatically in situations of concern.\r\nThe Pacific is faced with a different but no less \r\nserious set of humanitarian challenges. Up to 10 tropical \r\ncyclones can be expected over the next six months, \r\nadding to the impact of Cyclones Pam and Winston over \r\nthe past two years. Climate change will only increase \r\nthe risk of such events in future. Pacific island countries \r\nspoke clearly at the World Humanitarian Summit earlier \r\nthis year about how the international community can \r\nhelp them respond to natural disasters. One of their \r\nkey messages was that national Governments must be \r\nempowered and respected when responding to natural \r\ndisasters. After all, those Governments know their \r\nregions and their people best. New Zealand takes that \r\nmessage seriously and puts it into practice by working \r\nclosely with affected Governments to support, rather \r\nthan substitute for, nationally led responses.\r\nWe will continue to promote responses that are as \r\nlocal as possible and as international as necessary, in \r\nthe Pacific and elsewhere, to build national response \r\ncapacity. We are also helping the Pacific to improve \r\neconomic and community resilience to natural disasters \r\nthrough significant investment in key sectors of the \r\nPacific economy, such as renewable energy and tourism.\r\nWhile I would have liked to have ended on an \r\noptimistic note, I simply cannot. The year 2016 will \r\ngo down in history as an abysmal year for people \r\nliving in situations of conflict and disaster and for the \r\nhumanitarians worldwide who seek to support them. \r\nNew Zealand will do its part in 2017 to try to make \r\nthings better. We urge all members to do the same.\r\nMr. Tsutsumi (Japan): The world is facing several \r\nunprecedented humanitarian crises today. We are seeing \r\nprotracted crises, severe natural disasters and a huge \r\nnumber of people displaced by conflicts in many parts \r\nof the world. The Global Humanitarian Overview 2017 \r\nestimates that $22.2 billion will be required in 2017 \r\nto provide humanitarian assistance for 92.8 million \r\npeople. Against such a backdrop, humanitarian issues \r\nhave become one of the top agendas this year. In May, \r\nthe World Humanitarian Summit was held in Istanbul. \r\nIn September, the high-level plenary meeting on \r\nrefugees and migrants and the leaders summit on the \r\nglobal refugee crisis were held here in New York.\r\nThe World Humanitarian Summit provided an \r\nopportunity to rally a wide range of actors to engage \r\nin comprehensive discussions on humanitarian \r\nissues. Discussions on various topics at the \r\nSummit — gender, internally displaced persons and \r\npersons with disabilities, to name but a few — are \r\nreflected in the draft resolutions, which we hope will \r\nbe adopted later today. We welcome the fact that the \r\nA/71/PV.56 08/12/2016\r\n26/26 16-42340\r\noutcomes of the fruitful and constructive discussions \r\nat the Summit are now gradually beginning to be \r\nincorporated into intergovernmentally agreed texts.\r\nWe also welcome the presentation of the grand \r\nbargain document at the Summit in Istanbul. The \r\nfunding gap for humanitarian assistance has become \r\nlarger than ever. Therefore, creating efficient ways of \r\nimplementing assistance and shrinking overall need \r\nare of critical importance. We also welcome the fact \r\nthat many core elements of the grand bargain, such as \r\nthe importance of reducing duplication and the need to \r\nharmonize and simplify reporting requirements, are \r\nalso incorporated into the draft resolutions.\r\nIn September, leaders from around the world \r\ngathered in New York to discuss the large movement \r\nof refugees and migrants. Both the application of the \r\ncomprehensive refugee response framework and the \r\ndiscussions on the global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration have now begun. Japan supports the \r\nimplementation of the comprehensive refugee response \r\nframework through funding pilot projects. Japan is also \r\nready to constructively participate in the discussions on \r\nthe global compact on migration.\r\nAlthough discussions on humanitarian issues are \r\nmaking progress step by step, the bitter reality on the \r\nground seems unchanged. The number of displaced \r\npersons is increasing, and the fundamental rules of \r\ninternational humanitarian law are being neglected — or \r\nworse, deliberately violated. Discussions and resolutions \r\nmean nothing unless we can also realize some positive \r\nchanges in the ongoing crises.\r\nWhat we call humanitarian crises today are greater \r\nthan the issues that normally fall under the mandates of \r\nhumanitarian agencies. Because of their complex nature \r\nand large scope, most of them are also development \r\nchallenges as well as concerns of international peace \r\nand security. To end ongoing tragedies, the United \r\nNations should address those issues as a whole, in a \r\ncoordinated manner.\r\nAfter decades of discussions on the humanitarian \r\ndevelopment nexus, it has now become common \r\nunderstanding that development actors should also be \r\ninvolved from the onset of a humanitarian crisis. In \r\nthat regard, we are currently in the phase of discussing \r\nhow to collaborate with each other on the ground. For \r\nour part, Japan has been implementing pilot projects \r\nconcerning the humanitarian development nexus, in \r\ncollaboration with the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees and the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme, in nine countries, including \r\nTurkey, Uganda and Zambia, and providing assistance \r\ntotalling approximately $110 million in terms of both \r\nhumanitarian and development aspects.\r\nMoreover, Member States must insist on every \r\npossible occasion that all parties to conflicts should \r\nrespect international humanitarian law. In particular, \r\nattacks against medical facilities for strategic purposes \r\nare absolutely unacceptable. In that belief, Japan, \r\ntogether with New Zealand, Egypt, Spain and Uruguay, \r\ndrafted and led the adoption of Security Council \r\nresolution 2286 (2016) in May. Japan once again urges \r\nall parties to take concrete actions to protect medical \r\ncare in situations of armed conflict.\r\nBecause we hear and see the devastating reality \r\nso often, we tend to become pessimistic about the \r\nchallenge of humanitarian issues. However, we must \r\nalso recognize that humankind has been learning from \r\nhumanitarian crises and has made progress in response \r\nto them. The establishment of the United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies after the ravages of the Second \r\nWorld War is a good example. It is important that we \r\nnever reverse this progress, in honour of those affected \r\nby the crises of yesterday and for the sake of those \r\naffected by the crises of today and tomorrow.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): We have \r\nheard the last speaker inscribed on the list of speakers \r\nfor agenda item 69 and its sub-items (a) to (d) for this \r\nmeeting. We shall hear the remaining speakers this \r\nafternoon at 3 p.m. in the Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.55 p.m.\r\n"
