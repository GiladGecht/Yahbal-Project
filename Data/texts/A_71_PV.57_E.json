As we mark \r\nthe twenty-fifth anniversary of resolution 46/182, the \r\nframework and the instruments that that resolution has \r\nset continue to be relevant in shaping the international \r\nhumanitarian response system.\r\nLast week in Geneva, Under-Secretary-General \r\nStephen O’Brien stated that we face a time of immense \r\nglobal suffering and fear, and that 80 per cent of the \r\nhumanitarian needs stem from man-made conflicts, \r\nmany of which are now protracted. Despite all our \r\ncollective efforts, it is undeniable that the gap between \r\nhumanitarian needs and the resources available \r\nto address them continues to widen. Beyond the \r\ndevastating effects of man-made disasters, such as \r\nthe crisis ravaging in Syria, particularly in Aleppo, \r\nwe are also faced with other challenges. Public health \r\nemergencies, climate change and the effects of El Niño \r\nhave long-lasting impacts.

Millions of \r\nchildren are at risk of starting their lives without shelter \r\nor education.\r\nAs an effect of globalization, today’s humanitarian \r\nchallenges easily transcend borders. They therefore \r\ndemand better and collective solutions. Our humanity \r\nentails a responsibility that we should all shoulder so as \r\nto help those in need, whether they are on our doorstep \r\nor in faraway lands. At the opening of the first-ever \r\nWorld Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in May, \r\nPresident Erdoğan stated that we should never forget \r\nour responsibilities vis-à-vis the people who have set \r\ntheir hopes on the messages and commitments that \r\narose in Istanbul. Indeed, that is why Turkey strongly \r\nsupported the organization of that Summit from its \r\nvery inception. It was needed in order to sow the seeds \r\nof transformative change in the humanitarian system.\r\nIn Istanbul, we announced our support for the \r\ncommitments contained in the five core responsibilities \r\nset out in the Agenda for Humanity and made national \r\ncommitments to that end. We are pleased to note that \r\nthe Summit was a success. It brought together all the \r\nstakeholders of the world humanitarian community, with \r\na record 9,000 participants. Member States and other \r\nparticipants shared valuable experiences and expressed \r\ntheir commitments to the future of the humanitarian \r\nsystem. However, as has been the case with various \r\nUnited Nations-led achievements in the past few years, \r\nsuch as the Sustainable Development Goals or the New \r\nYork Declaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution \r\n71/1), we are cognizant of the fact that we need to move \r\nahead with the implementation. The aftermath of the \r\nIstanbul Summit is crucially important for the future \r\nof the humanitarian system. We need to build on the \r\nglobal momentum that the Summit has generated and \r\nassume our responsibilities for the follow-up in order to \r\nimprove our collective response.\r\nBearing that in mind, we should continue our \r\nefforts to ensure strong political leadership aimed \r\nat addressing the root causes of conflicts and crises; \r\naddress the need for fair burden-sharing, because it \r\nis our common responsibility to help people in need; \r\nalways recall that no humanitarian problem is local, \r\nas all crises can become global; exert great efforts to \r\nsupport the humanitarian-development nexus through \r\nhuman-centered policies and, finally, increase our \r\nfinancial resources and use existing ones in a more \r\nefficient manner. While doing all of that, we should \r\nwork in close partnership with all stakeholders.\r\nAs the world’s largest refugee-hosting country and \r\nthe second-largest individual humanitarian donor in the \r\nworld in 2015, Turkey’s humanitarian assistance efforts, \r\nbe it in Somalia, Haiti, Myanmar, Iraq or Syria, will \r\ncontinue in that spirit. Our common objective remains \r\nsimple — to better respond to humanitarian crises in \r\norder to save lives and thereby, save humankind. We \r\nare confident that the Istanbul Summit was a point of \r\ndeparture for us all in reaching that common objective.\r\nMr. Ja’afari (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): Every year, we meet to reiterate our \r\nhumanitarian and ethical commitments to extending \r\nhumanitarian assistance to all those in need without \r\ndiscrimination, politicization or blackmail, in \r\naccordance with the humanitarian principles in which \r\nwe all believe.\r\nWe emphasize our concern that some States, \r\norganizations and other actors have been using \r\nhumanitarian action to serve inhumane political and \r\neconomic agendas and achieve other goals and interests \r\nin order to defame and malign the Governments of \r\nMember States. That negatively affects humanitarian \r\naction itself, as well as the stability of States and the \r\nwelfare of peoples.\r\nIn my statement, I should like to clarify the \r\nposition of my country, Syria, vis-à-vis the draft \r\nresolutions on humanitarian assistance in their various \r\nmanifestations. I wish to reiterate the commitment of \r\nmy Government to its firm and principled position \r\nin favour of extending humanitarian assistance to all \r\nthose who are disadvantaged without discrimination, in \r\naccordance with our constitutional duties.\r\nWe also emphasize our continued cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations and its agencies in order to \r\nensure the delivery of such assistance on the basis of \r\nrespect for the United Nations guiding principles and \r\nto extend humanitarian assistance in emergencies, \r\nas specified in resolution 46/182. At the forefront of \r\nthose principles are respect for national sovereignty \r\nand the role of the States concerned in overseeing the \r\ndistribution of humanitarian assistance within their \r\nterritories and the principles of impartiality, integrity \r\nand non-politicization.\r\nRegrettably, the actions of some sponsors of the \r\ndraft resolutions and some of those responsible for \r\nthe coordination of humanitarian assistance — the \r\nOffice for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs \r\nbeing at the forefront of the latter — demonstrate a \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.57\r\n16-42551 3/19\r\npreoccupation with politicizing humanitarian crises and \r\nseek disgracefully to cover up the cardinal reasons for \r\nthose crises. We have to state that the optimal solution \r\nfor such humanitarian crises lies in addressing their \r\nroot causes and consequences without politicizing or \r\ntwisting facts. I wish to make the following observations \r\non the draft resolutions:\r\nFirst, with regard to combating terrorism, my \r\ndelegation is of the view that the fact that draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.34 contains, for the first time, a reference to \r\nterrorism as one of the main causes of humanitarian \r\ncrises, after that issue having been ignored for years, \r\nconstitutes an important step in the right direction. Some \r\nStates have recently stated — albeit reservedly — that \r\nviolence, poverty and disasters are not the only reasons \r\nleading to evacuation, displacement and humanitarian \r\ncrises, and that another basic cause of such phenomena \r\nis terrorism.\r\nDespite the importance of that step, it is too \r\nlittle, too late. We must use stronger language that \r\nunambiguously and decisively condemns tourist acts, \r\nas was done last year in resolution 70/104, entitled \r\n“Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and \r\nprotection of United Nations personnel”. It seems that \r\nsome tend to forget that terrorism is the main scourge \r\nof humanitarian crises, be it in my country of Syria or \r\nin Iraq, Libya and other States.\r\nA case in point is the terrorist madness that is \r\nkilling innocent civilians throughout the world. We have \r\nwarned about that problem for a long time. Terrorism \r\nis the cardinal reason for the suffering of the Syrian \r\npeople, particularly women and children. Combating \r\nit requires cooperation with the Syrian Government, \r\nwhich is struggling to combat terrorism on behalf of the \r\nworld. We have called for pressure to be brought to bear \r\non States that support terrorist armed groups to stop \r\narming, financing, training and sheltering such groups, \r\nin line with the relevant Security Council resolutions \r\non combating terrorism.\r\nNot only have our recurrent calls fallen on deaf \r\nears, but our very stance has been distorted and called \r\ninto question. I insist that efforts to address the main \r\ncause of the humanitarian crisis in Syria should focus \r\non international coordination and cooperation with \r\nthe Government of Syria and its efforts to combat \r\nterrorism in all its aspects and forms, as well as on \r\nthe implementation of the pertinent Security Council \r\nresolutions and returning to the goals and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations.\r\nSecondly, I turn to the grave consequences of \r\nunilateral economic coercive measures. The United \r\nNations has rejected and condemned the imposition \r\nof unilateral economic coercive measures, given \r\ntheir illegitimate nature and disastrous impact on \r\nthe economies of States and the welfare of peoples. \r\nHowever, some sponsors of the draft resolution still \r\nseek to avoid any reference to such measures.\r\nThose measures continue to date, despite repeated \r\ninternational calls and demands to terminate them \r\nforthright, given their disastrous impact on the \r\nSyrian economy and the living conditions of Syrians. \r\nThey have caused thousands of Syrians to f lee their \r\nhomeland and prevented the implementation of health \r\nand humanitarian response plans in Syria, as described \r\nin the Humanitarian Response Plan Monitoring Report \r\nissued in September by the United Nations Resident \r\nRepresentative Office, in cooperation with the International \r\nSociety for Quality in Health Care.\r\nThe report emphasizes that the unilateral economic \r\nmeasures imposed by the United States and the European \r\nUnion against Syria adversely affect all categories of Syrian \r\ncitizens. It is paradoxical that the draft resolution contains \r\na reference to resolution 70/1, on the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, but no reference to the adverse \r\neffects of those measures. How can States be expected to \r\nimplement the Agenda while sanctions are being imposed \r\non them?\r\nWe wish to reiterate our reservations on the inclusion in \r\nthe draft resolution of a reference to the World Humanitarian \r\nSummit and its conclusions, because the host country, \r\nTurkey, did not allow my delegation to participate. We are \r\ntherefore not party to that conference or to its resolutions. \r\nWe wish also to enter our reservations with regard to the \r\nreference to the New York Declaration for Refugees and \r\nMigrants (resolution 71/1). As a United Nations document, \r\nthe draft resolution ought to address general situations in all \r\nStates and not specific States. We had hoped to hear the voice \r\nof the provisions of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\ninternational law, not those of influential financing States. \r\nMeetings should not be exploited to politicize the guiding \r\nhumanitarian principles of the United Nations, which are of \r\ngreat significance in terms of humanitarian action among \r\nMember States.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to comment on the \r\nstatement by the representative of Israel. The General \r\nA/71/PV.57 08/12/2016\r\n4/19 16-42551\r\nAssembly knows that Zionism is the Israeli ideology \r\non the basis of which it established itself in occupied \r\nPalestine. Zionism is a form of racial discrimination. It \r\nis equivalent to Da’esh, as Zionist ideology maintains \r\nthe desire to take over the entire area of Palestine in \r\norder to establish a Jewish State, excluding all others, \r\nincluding Muslims and Christians. The Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claims something very \r\nsimilar. It claims that it wants to set up a State only for \r\nthose who believe in Da’esh, and not for all Muslims. \r\nThat simple comparison reveals that the cause for \r\nthe disasters and crises in our area is Israel, which \r\nhas introduced racial and religious radicalism and \r\nintolerance into our region and introduced the concept \r\nof occupying the lands of others.\r\nFor 60 or 70 years, hundreds of resolutions have \r\nbeen adopted by the Organization condemning Israel \r\nand its aggressive policies. It is not only today that we are \r\ndiscovering Israel’s aggressive policies; we discovered \r\nthem a long time ago, and we are all too familiar with \r\nthem. There is therefore no need to respond to the \r\nillusions and falsifications that are put forward by the \r\nIsraeli delegation to mislead the audience in this Hall.\r\nI would like to remind the Assembly that Israel’s \r\nauthorities have links with the terrorists of Jabhat \r\nAl-Nusra and ISIL in the occupied Golan. Israel \r\nprotects ISIL and Jabhat al-Nusrah. It helped them to \r\nevict the United Nations Disengagement Observer \r\nForce contingent stationed at the separation line on the \r\noccupied Golan. Just yesterday, Israel launched rockets \r\ninto the heart of Damascus, into the area of Al-Miza. \r\nNobody should therefore blame us when we respond to \r\nthose brazen Israeli actions at the appropriate time.\r\nMr. Zehnder (Switzerland) (spoke in French): \r\nHumanitarian needs continue to grow year after year. \r\nThe fundamental rules of international humanitarian \r\nlaw are being violated as never before. The number of \r\npeople forcibly displaced, to escape violence or natural \r\ndisaster, has reached a record high. Humanitarian \r\nworkers are regularly the target of attacks, and their \r\naccess to people in need is increasingly denied. \r\nAgainst that backdrop, the international community \r\nmust provide a strong and united response. The draft \r\nresolutions that we are discussing today should be an \r\nexpression of that response. I would like to emphasize \r\nthree points.\r\nFirst, Switzerland considers international \r\nhumanitarian law to be the principal universal legal \r\nframework for the protection of all victims in armed \r\nconflicts and the provision of humanitarian assistance. \r\nThat legal framework must be respected by all parties to \r\nan armed conflict. In that regard, there are considerable \r\nchallenges: access to those in need must be improved, \r\nthe safety of those who risk their lives to care for the \r\nsick and wounded must be strengthened, and violations \r\nof international law are unacceptable and must be \r\neffectively prosecuted. In the light of the ongoing \r\nconflicts in Syria, Yemen, South Sudan and Iraq, it is \r\nour duty to strengthen protection for all war victims \r\nand humanitarian health workers in accordance with \r\nthe Geneva Conventions and their Additional Protocols.\r\nSecondly, the phenomenon of forced displacement \r\ncaused by natural disasters, climate change or armed \r\nconflict requires the close coordination of humanitarian \r\nand development activities, as well as of those in the \r\nareas of peacebuilding and human rights. We need \r\nan approach that encompasses prevention, protection \r\nand resilience.\r\nThirdly, the commitments made at the World \r\nHumanitarian Summit in May provide a unique \r\nopportunity to transform and strengthen the global \r\nhumanitarian system in the long term. Those \r\ncommitments, particularly within the framework of \r\nthe grand bargain on humanitarian financing, must \r\nmaterialize, in order to be able to provide a more \r\neffective humanitarian response to the needs of an ever-\r\nincreasing number of victims.\r\nGiven the enormous humanitarian challenges that \r\nwe currently face, the draft resolutions that we are \r\nadopting today should represent a strong and united \r\nresponse from the international community. However, \r\nalthough some progress was made in the negotiations \r\non the drafts, we see that they in no way go far enough \r\nto meet the requirements of the global humanitarian \r\nsituation. We regret in particular that genuine, concrete \r\nprogress could not be made in terms of international \r\nhumanitarian law, owing to the inflexible positions of \r\nsome delegations.\r\nHowever, my delegation wishes to express its deep \r\ngratitude to the representatives who facilitated the \r\nvarious draft resolutions. The facilitators have been \r\nfully engaged in their efforts to arrive at decisions by \r\nconsensus. That consensus, which is a testament to the \r\nunity of States in the face of humanitarian needs, has \r\nbeen consistently respected in the past. We regret that \r\nsuch a consensus could not be respected within the \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.57\r\n16-42551 5/19\r\nframework of the draft resolution entitled “Safety and \r\nsecurity of humanitarian personnel and protection of \r\nUnited Nations personnel” (A/71/L.34). Concerning \r\ndraft resolution A/71/L.32, entitled “Strengthening of \r\nthe coordination of emergency humanitarian assistance \r\nof the United Nations”, my delegation regrets that the \r\nconsensus reached during the negotiations was not \r\nrespected during the silence procedure.\r\nMy delegation believes that draft resolutions must \r\nbe negotiated in good faith and full transparency, and \r\ncalls on Member States to engage constructively during \r\nnegotiations and to respect the consensus once it has \r\nbeen reached. We, the Member States, owe that much \r\nto the victims of armed conflicts and disasters, who \r\ndepend on humanitarian aid, as well as to the workers \r\nwho provide that aid, often risking their lives to do so.\r\nMrs. Kanchaveli (Georgia): Georgia aligns \r\nitself with the statement made by the observer of the \r\nEuropean Union (see A/71/PV.56), and I would like to \r\nmake a few additional remarks in my national capacity.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to acknowledge the \r\nwork of the delegation of Sweden in successfully \r\nnegotiating the text of the humanitarian omnibus draft \r\nresolution, entitled “Strengthening of the coordination \r\nof emergency humanitarian assistance of the United \r\nNations” (A/71/L.32), and in securing consensus on the \r\ndocument again this year. The draft resolution maintains \r\nits focus on the most pressing issues concerning the \r\nhumanitarian situation around the globe, and covers \r\nthe issues of forced displacement and the protection \r\nof civilians and medical personnel and facilities, \r\nwhile stressing the need for strengthening respect for \r\ninternational humanitarian law and human rights law, \r\nas well as for supporting enhanced humanitarian action \r\nin the context of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, in accordance with the commitment to \r\nleave no one behind.\r\nIn today’s world, more than 60 million people have \r\nbeen forced to abandon their homes and f lee in search \r\nof safety owing to conflicts and violence or man-\r\nmade or natural disasters around the world. Today, \r\nthey represent the world’s most vulnerable groups, \r\nwhich are at high risk of being left behind. To echo \r\nthe Secretary-General, delivering better for people \r\nin need, inter alia, encompasses strengthening the \r\nrespect for humanitarian international law, ensuring \r\nhumanitarian access and protecting humanitarian and \r\nhealth-care personnel.\r\nOver the years, the position of Georgia on \r\nhumanitarian issues has been coherent and cohesive \r\nin its substance and modalities. Political impasses or \r\nparalysis should not hinder humanitarian action. In \r\nthat regard, we stress the importance of humanitarian \r\naccess, which is also a human rights issue, while \r\nrecognizing that the humanitarian principles of \r\nhumanity, impartiality, neutrality and independence \r\nplay a central role in establishing and maintaining \r\naccess to the victims, and should be respected by \r\nall actors.\r\nIn the light of the current challenges to the securing \r\nand sustaining of humanitarian access by humanitarian \r\npersonnel, including the personnel of United Nations \r\nhumanitarian agencies, and bearing in mind the central \r\nrole that access plays in contributing to humanitarian \r\nassistance and protection, my delegation raised the \r\nconcern regarding the lack of access in various parts \r\nof the world during the negotiations on the text of the \r\nhumanitarian omnibus draft resolution in document \r\nA/71/L.32 and, together with other delegations, \r\nwas advocating for the strengthening of the call for \r\nbetter access.\r\nFor years, 20 per cent of Georgia’s sovereign \r\nterritories have remained inaccessible to international \r\nmonitoring missions, including the Office of the \r\nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights \r\n(OHCHR) and other human rights mechanisms, owing \r\nto the current illegal military occupation of those \r\nterritories by foreign forces. The denial of access raises \r\nthe legitimate questions expressed by the OHCHR \r\nregarding the blocking of access to international \r\nobservers. Furthermore, hundreds of thousands of \r\nvictims of ethnic cleansing — refugees and internally \r\ndisplaced persons — are unable to return to their \r\nplaces of habitual residence, while those residing \r\ninside the occupied regions continue to be deprived \r\nof fundamental rights and freedoms, including but not \r\nlimited to the right to free movement and to education \r\nin one’s native language.\r\nDuring humanitarian emergencies, the delivery \r\nof humanitarian assistance and health care to those in \r\nneed should be the priority. However, addressing the \r\nimmediate, short-term needs, such as providing the \r\ndisplaced populations with appropriate shelter, food \r\nand health care, may not be enough. The plight of those \r\nforcibly displaced people remains unresolved in many \r\ncases, as it is impossible to provide conditions for the \r\nexercise of their inalienable right to a safe and dignified \r\nA/71/PV.57 08/12/2016\r\n6/19 16-42551\r\nreturn to their homes. The voluntary return rate — a \r\nmeasure of how many internally displaced persons and \r\nrefugees can safely go back home — is at its lowest \r\nin over three decades. We must support the right to \r\nsafe and voluntary return, if we wish to manage forced \r\ndisplacements with effectiveness and efficiency.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of global humanitarian crises \r\ncaused by violence and armed conflict, transnational \r\nterrorism and violent extremism, as well as by climate \r\nchange and global health threats, Georgia believes that \r\nthe international community should focus on more \r\neffectively protecting humankind and humanitarian \r\nprinciples. The international community ought to \r\ndo more to assist the most vulnerable groups of \r\npopulations. First and foremost, that includes those \r\naffected by armed conflict and those in post-conflict \r\nsituations. The international community must also \r\nreduce the vulnerability of people to natural disasters.\r\nMs. Pritchard (Canada): As a number of \r\nhumanitarian draft resolutions have been submitted \r\ntoday for action, Canada would like to speak to the \r\nhumanitarian situation that we see around the world \r\nand how it is reflected in the draft resolutions that are \r\ncurrently before Member States.\r\nWe live in a world in which increasingly complicated \r\nand protracted crises have become the norm. Given the \r\nscale of current needs, we must work together with \r\nall partners to develop innovative programming that \r\naddresses the underlying causes of conflict. Canada is \r\nchanging how we work in order to ensure that every \r\ndollar goes as far as possible to reach those in need. For \r\nexample, Canada is doing more to provide multi-year \r\nfunding in order to allow for better humanitarian \r\nplanning and results. That includes enabling host \r\ncountries and communities to deliver adequate services \r\nto large numbers of refugees and displaced people.\r\n(spoke in French) Canada remains deeply concerned \r\nabout the growing number of people subject to forced \r\ndisplacement, as well as about the discrimination and \r\nmarginalization that characterize the experiences of \r\nmany refugees and migrants globally. Canada is grateful \r\nfor the generosity of the numerous host countries and \r\ncommunities around the world, and we will continue \r\nto assume our responsibility in welcoming our most \r\nvulnerable neighbours when they most need it.\r\nCanada remains resolved to respond to the world’s \r\nneeds. That is why Prime Minister Trudeau promised \r\nto increase the humanitarian aid doled out in 2016-\r\n2017 by at least 10 per cent, as compared with the \r\ntotal of $684 million from 2015-2016. That will help \r\nour partners in the United Nations, the Red Cross and \r\nnon-governmental organizations to better support \r\nthose affected by crises, including the so-called \r\nforgotten crises.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAnd yet every year, we see more and more people \r\naffected by humanitarian crises. The United Nations \r\nhas recently appealed for $22.2 billion to respond to \r\nthe needs of over 90 million people in 2017. Those are \r\nshocking figures that demand our attention and real \r\ncollaboration. We already know that women and girls are \r\ndisproportionately affected and that social inequalities \r\ngrow worse during a crisis. As a result, women and \r\ngirls face even greater risks of being sexually abused, \r\ntrafficked or forced into marriage. They are more likely \r\nto be displaced. The burden of care that they carry for \r\ntheir families and their communities increases, and \r\ntheir access to essential sexual and reproductive health \r\nservices is reduced. When humanitarian assistance \r\ndoes not take their needs into account, the inequalities \r\nthat exist are reinforced. Put quite simply, that \r\nis unacceptable.\r\nWe know that women’s knowledge and leadership \r\ncan be critical to preventing and responding to crises. \r\nIn the midst of a crisis, women and girls are not just \r\nvictims. Rather, they are resilient people, and many \r\nof them have survived tremendous losses. They are \r\nthe experts. We need to ask them and ourselves how \r\nwe can support their participation, leadership, and \r\ndecision-making in their communities.\r\nWe are pleased in particular to have made \r\nimprovements in the humanitarian draft resolutions \r\nbefore us today so that they better reflect today’s \r\nrealities and our changing mindset. However, we are \r\nconcerned at how difficult it has been to address the \r\ncritical issue of the protection of civilians in times \r\nof conflict. Indiscriminate attacks on humanitarian \r\nand medical personnel, on the wounded and sick, on \r\nhospitals and civilians, including children, are taking \r\nplace on a regular and sometimes daily basis.\r\nAs Member States, we must remind ourselves \r\nof our obligations under international human rights \r\nlaw and international humanitarian law, in particular \r\nthe obligation to allow and facilitate the rapid and \r\nunimpeded passage of humanitarian relief for civilians \r\nin need. The focus of our attention should be on the \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.57\r\n16-42551 7/19\r\nlife-saving needs of civilians and their protection \r\nin times of humanitarian crises. We reiterate that \r\ncompliance with obligations under international \r\nhumanitarian law is absolutely essential in that \r\nregard. Not only are those obligations matters of legal \r\nresponsibility, the principles that they represent are \r\nthe very essence of humanity. Canada will therefore \r\ncontinue to promote principled humanitarian action \r\nand support concerted efforts to address the challenges \r\nfaced by humanitarians in complex environments.\r\nBefore closing, I wish to say that we are concerned \r\nby calls for a vote on draft resolution A/71/L.34, on the \r\nsafety and security of humanitarian personnel, which \r\nis based on well-established norms of international \r\nlaw. We believe that calls for a vote send all the wrong \r\nmessages, especially given the scale of the humanitarian \r\ncrises that we are facing.\r\nIn closing, Canada would like to commend the \r\nremarkable dedication of United Nations personnel, \r\nhumanitarian workers and medical personnel, \r\nincluding international, national and local staff, in \r\ndelivering life-saving assistance to those most in need \r\nin increasingly complex and volatile environments at \r\ngreat personal risk. Their work brings hope, dignity \r\nand life to the world’s most vulnerable.\r\nMr. Kazi (Bangladesh): Bangladesh attaches \r\ngreat importance to the humanitarian and emergency \r\nrelief assistance provided through the United Nations \r\nand remains supportive of international efforts to help \r\nbuild resilient societies and nations and to respond to \r\nhumanitarian challenges. We stress that the constructive \r\nengagement and coordinating role of national \r\nGovernments, especially their leaders, are instrumental \r\nin facilitating international humanitarian assistance.\r\nAs our delegation underlined at the World \r\nHumanitarian Summit in May, international \r\nhumanitarian assistance must be premised on the \r\nbasic principles of humanity, neutrality, impartiality \r\nand independence. We underscore the need for better \r\ncoherence and coordination among Member States, \r\nUnited Nations agencies and other relevant stakeholders \r\nwith a view to promoting the spirit of working together \r\nfor humankind. The unwarranted politicization of \r\nhumanitarian issues must be avoided in order to \r\nmake sure that humanitarian response is fast, timely, \r\nmore effective and targeted to the evolving needs on \r\nthe ground.\r\nIn recent years, we have witnessed continued high \r\ndemand for humanitarian relief and assistance across \r\nthe globe, owing mostly to the increased numbers \r\nof natural disasters, armed conflicts and crises of \r\na protracted nature. Climate change, unplanned \r\nurbanization, irregular human mobility, epidemics, \r\nrecurrent food crises, and water and energy insecurity \r\ncontinue to threaten the preservation of the development \r\ngains already achieved in many developing countries, \r\nespecially the least developed countries. The resulting \r\nconsequence of underdevelopment, poverty and \r\ninequality increases the vulnerability of the affected \r\npeople and reduces their capacity to cope with various \r\nendogenous and exogenous shocks.\r\nWe believe that sustainable development is the most \r\neffective preventive prescription for many humanitarian \r\ncrises, including those related to forced displacement. \r\nThe international community needs to consider and \r\nundertake development activities with a focus on \r\nbuilding resilience and eventually reducing dependency \r\non humanitarian aid. The underlying root causes that \r\nadversely impact the effectiveness of humanitarian \r\nassistance need to be addressed in a holistic manner. \r\nThere is a need for discretion in apportioning financial \r\nsupport for humanitarian and development work \r\nwithout compromising their respective priorities.\r\nBangladesh recognizes the importance of the \r\ntransition from emergency response to preparedness \r\nand resilience-building. Many developing countries, \r\nespecially the less-developed countries, suffer from \r\nsystemic constraints in terms of the finance, technology \r\nand development capacities needed to effectively \r\nwithstand and overcome humanitarian challenges.\r\nThe international community should, in full respect \r\nfor national conditions and actual needs on the ground, \r\ndevelop mechanisms to provide enhanced, sustainable, \r\nf lexible and multi-year-based financing support \r\nand related expertise, technologies and products. In \r\nthat context, we reiterate the need for effective and \r\nmeaningful implementation of the provisions of the \r\nSendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015-\r\n2030. We also acknowledge the centrality of the role \r\nof women as first responders and the need to further \r\nstrengthen gender-responsive policy development \r\nconcerning disaster-risk reduction and mitigation.\r\nBangladesh remains concerned over the reported \r\ndenial of humanitarian access in many conflict \r\nsituations, including in a neighbouring context in \r\nA/71/PV.57 08/12/2016\r\n8/19 16-42551\r\nrecent times. We condemn the indiscriminate armed \r\nattacks against humanitarian personnel and convoys, \r\nmedical and peacekeeping personnel and the civilian \r\ninfrastructure essential for humanitarian operations. \r\nWe urge all parties to conflicts to refrain from such \r\negregious attacks, blockades and impediments, in \r\nconformity with international humanitarian law. We \r\nalso emphasize the importance of evidence-based \r\ninformation to ensure probity and accountability in the \r\nevent of any such reported violation.\r\nAs a climate-vulnerable and disaster-prone \r\ncountry, Bangladesh continues to make substantive \r\ninvestments in disaster-risk reduction, prevention, \r\nmitigation and relief, building on lessons learned as \r\nwell as on international best practices. In line with \r\nour commitment to share our home-grown expertise \r\nand innovations with others in a comparable situation, \r\nwe have made efforts to stand by disaster-affected \r\npeople in Nepal, Haiti, Sri Lanka and the Philippines \r\nin recent times.\r\nIn Bangladesh, our Government has established \r\na National Committee on International Humanitarian \r\nLaw so as to ensure the further dissemination and \r\nawareness-building of international humanitarian law \r\namong our people, with the support of the International \r\nCommittee of the Red Cross. At the international \r\nlevel, we remain committed to promoting advocacy for \r\naddressing the humanitarian needs of those displaced \r\nas a result of climate change, especially in cross-\r\nborder contexts.\r\nWe look forward to enhanced coordination and \r\ncoherence among the relevant United Nations entities \r\nand other stakeholders in further promoting dialogue \r\non that emerging issue. As hosts to a protracted refugee \r\nsituation involving an oft-forgotten people, Bangladesh \r\nreiterates the need to explore avenues to further \r\nstrengthen the international burden- and responsibility-\r\nsharing framework for the protection and assistance of \r\nrefugees and other displaced population groups.\r\nIn conclusion, we thank all of the facilitators for \r\ntheir diligent work on the draft resolutions, which our \r\ndelegation is pleased to support.\r\nMr. Sadykov (Kazakhstan): In my statement I shall \r\nfocus on the draft resolution on Chernobyl (A/71/L.28). \r\nWe are honoured to co-sponsor that draft resolution \r\nregarding the continuing grave effects of the Chernobyl \r\ndisaster, which will be adopted today by consensus. \r\nWe believe that the decision to designate 26 April as \r\nInternational Chernobyl Disaster Remembrance Day \r\nwill raise awareness of the long-term consequences \r\nof the Chernobyl and Fukushima disasters and drive \r\naction to prevent such casualties in the future.\r\nApproximately 30,000 technical and nuclear \r\nexperts and military servicemen from Kazakhstan were \r\namong the first to arrive in the accident zone in April \r\n1986 to help reduce the consequences of the Chernobyl \r\nexplosion. In solidarity, Kazakhstan participated \r\nactively in the reconstruction of the sarcophagus of the \r\nChernobyl nuclear-power plant, allocating more than \r\n€2 million to that cause.\r\nWe fully support the decision to be taken by \r\nthe United Nations today, as Kazakhstan itself has \r\nsuffered from nuclear-weapons testing. Having \r\ndirectly experienced those horrors, my country is \r\ntoday recognized as a passionate campaigner for \r\npeace and nuclear security and disarmament. The \r\narea in Kazakhstan affected by intense nuclear testing \r\ncomprises more than 300,000 square kilometres, and \r\nthe consequences are tragic. The land has been rendered \r\nuseless and unfit for human habitation, agriculture or \r\neconomic activity. Nearly 1.5 million people have been \r\nimpacted by nuclear and radiological contamination, \r\nresulting in fatalities, cancer and weakened immune \r\nsystems. The incidence of disease has increased and \r\nthe duration of recovery prolonged, with phenomenally \r\nhigh costs.\r\nKazakhstan has struggled with the consequences \r\nof the nuclear tragedy for more than two decades and \r\ncalls on the international community to intensify \r\nefforts aimed at nuclear security and disarmament, \r\nas well as at the non-proliferation of weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. We thank the United Nations system and \r\nseveral countries for helping to fund our recovery \r\nefforts. Much has been done, but the effects of 40 years \r\nof testing will require many more years before that vast \r\nregion is rehabilitated. International efforts will have to \r\nbe stepped up to return it to normalcy.\r\nNext year, we will introduce a draft resolution \r\nentitled “International cooperation and coordination \r\nfor the human and ecological rehabilitation and \r\neconomic development of the Semipalatinsk region of \r\nKazakhstan”. It will be the ninth time that such a draft \r\nresolution has been submitted. In that regard, we also \r\nexpress our deep appreciation to the Member States that \r\nhave previously supported that resolution. My delegation \r\ndeems that support to be recognition of the historic \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.57\r\n16-42551 9/19\r\ncontribution of Kazakhstan to nuclear disarmament and \r\nthe non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nIndeed, in 1991, for the first time in world history, the \r\nhuge nuclear test site in the Semipalatinsk region of \r\nKazakhstan was shut down by decree of the President \r\nof our country, Mr. Nursultan Nazarbayev.\r\nWe have since worked closely with the United \r\nStates, the Russian Federation and the International \r\nAtomic Energy Agency on institutional arrangements \r\nfor nuclear safety and security and worked with \r\nMember States to implement the recommendations of \r\nthe four Nuclear Security Summits. Next year, we will \r\nhost on our territory the International Atomic Energy \r\nAgency Low Enriched Uranium Bank as a measure to \r\nstrengthen the non-proliferation regime and thereby \r\nreduce nuclear risks.\r\nThe General Assembly draft resolution on \r\nChernobyl is clear evidence of the recognition by the \r\ninternational community that that issue remains a \r\nmatter of serious concern for the people of the planet. \r\nWe stand with all countries around the world that have \r\nsuffered from nuclear tests and disasters. It confirms \r\nour deep conviction that such problems can be solved \r\nonly by the joint efforts of the international community.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with General \r\nAssembly resolution 49/2, of 19 October 1994, I now \r\ncall on the observer of the International Federation of \r\nRed Cross and Red Crescent Societies.\r\nMr. Senghore (International Federation of Red \r\nCross and Red Crescent Societies): On behalf of the \r\nInternational Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent \r\nSocieties (IFRC), allow me to express my appreciation \r\nfor the opportunity to address this important debate.\r\nThis fall, Member States adopted the New York \r\nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution \r\n71/1) and the New Urban Agenda in Quito, adding to \r\nthe several multilateral agreements adopted during \r\nthe previous year, many of which have important \r\nimplications for humanitarian action. Each of those \r\nagreements has, in one way or another, recognized the \r\nimportance of bridging humanitarian and development \r\naction. That bridge in programmes, in finance and in \r\napproaches is critical if we are to effectively respond \r\nto the ever-growing humanitarian needs. Allow me to \r\nmake three points in that regard.\r\nThe principle of leaving no one behind, as enshrined \r\nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\ncannot be realized without addressing the needs of \r\nthose caught in humanitarian crises. That includes \r\nthe many people affected by the biggest displacement \r\ncrisis of our time. With the adoption of the New York \r\nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants in September, \r\nthe international community recognized the need to act \r\nurgently to stem the loss of lives, the suffering and the \r\nneedless indignities inflicted on those valuable people.\r\nThe current process leading towards a Global \r\nCompact for safe, orderly and regular migration is \r\na welcome step. We are particularly interested in the \r\npotential for the Compact to support a more effective \r\napproach to the humanitarian and protection needs \r\nof the most vulnerable migrants. We hope to see the \r\nCompact lay out concrete goals and activities to reduce \r\nthe number of deaths and the privation and suffering of \r\nmigrants, and ensure that migrants have safe access to \r\nessential services and accurate information that allows \r\nthem to make safer choices along their journey. We \r\nalso hope the process will strongly reaffirm the need \r\nto counter xenophobia, discrimination and violence \r\nagainst migrants.\r\nThe IFRC is working together with its national \r\nsocieties with and for vulnerable migrants to help \r\nthem meet their immediate needs and integrate into the \r\nsocieties that host them. We will be pleased to contribute \r\nour expertise in the Global Compact consultations that \r\nwill be taking place next year. We commend the efforts \r\nto design an inclusive, transparent and action-oriented \r\nconsultation process that includes various stakeholders \r\nat a global, regional and subregional level. We would \r\nalso recommend holding national consultations, as \r\nthat would help to ensure a more context-specific and \r\ninclusive process.\r\nThe important topic of localizing aid has been \r\nextensively promoted on the international policy \r\nagenda in 2016, including through the grand bargain \r\non humanitarian financing, which features specific \r\ncommitments to support local and national responders. \r\nWe think that greater support for local actors can make \r\nan important difference in the timeliness, efficiency \r\nand appropriateness of humanitarian aid.\r\nIn the short term, we are hopeful that the various \r\ncommitments of the grand bargain, including the goal \r\nof channelling at least 25 per cent of humanitarian \r\nfunds as directly as possible to local and national actors \r\nby 2020, will begin moving us in the right direction. \r\nIn the long term, humanitarian and development actors \r\nA/71/PV.57 08/12/2016\r\n10/19 16-42551\r\nneed to invest in the pre-emption of future crises, \r\nstrengthening the functional and operational capacities \r\nof local Governments and civil-society actors in order \r\nto ensure that local actors are as ready and capable as \r\npossible to step up to the needs in their communities. \r\nIt is also important to avoid overwhelming local actors \r\nwith a sudden influx of relief funds.\r\nWith regard to funding, the international \r\ncommunity has fallen short in identifying emergency \r\nfunding mechanisms that are adaptable to local action. \r\nFor its part, the IFRC Disaster Relief Emergency Fund \r\ncan quickly disburse funds, both for emergency relief \r\noperations and for making preparations in the event of an \r\nimminent disaster, to a national society within 24 hours \r\nand with minimal bureaucracy, while still ensuring \r\nproper accountability. However, we have recognized \r\nthat that is not enough, and we are currently working \r\nwith our partners in the International Committee of \r\nthe Red Cross and a number of donors to develop a \r\ncapacity-building fund with an eye towards developing \r\nlonger-term sustainability and f lexibility.\r\nThe IFRC welcomes the recognition given to \r\nRed Cross efforts in this year’s draft resolution on \r\ninternational cooperation on humanitarian assistance \r\nin the field of natural disasters (A/71/L.33). We \r\nacknowledge the usefulness of developing and \r\nenhancing forecast-based preparedness systems, \r\nmaking resources available for action in anticipation \r\nof natural disasters and making ex ante investments in \r\norder to mitigate disaster risks and build resilience. For \r\nour part, we are in the process of piloting a forecast-\r\nbased financing mechanism that enables the allocation \r\nof funds for the timely implementation of early action \r\nand preparedness for responses based on forecast \r\ninformation before disasters happen. Using a forecast-\r\nbased financing mechanism, investment is allocated \r\nbased not only on a certain forecast, but also on a clear \r\nunderstanding of potential impacts and a cost-benefit \r\nanalysis of actions. It will facilitate decision-making \r\nprocesses in scenarios of uncertainty.\r\nThe IFRC and its 190 national societies have been \r\nworking to assist vulnerable people for approximately \r\n150 years. We will continue to mobilize the power \r\nof humankind to provide life-saving assistance to \r\nvulnerable people. We will also continue to work \r\nwith Governments in our auxiliary function to deliver \r\nservices at the last mile.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with \r\nresolution 45/6, I now call on the observer of the \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross.\r\nMs. Duran (International Committee of the \r\nRed Cross): The year 2016 has been a big year for \r\nUnited Nations policy-making. The 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development came into force. The \r\nNew York Declaration on Migrants and Refugees \r\n(resolution 71/1) and the Quito New Urban Agenda were \r\nadopted by Member States. Each of those decisions \r\ninvolves important humanitarian commitments. The \r\nInternational Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) \r\nwelcomes them and is ready to advise on humanitarian \r\naspects of the Compacts on migrants and refugees, \r\nwhich States will start developing in 2017.\r\nThe World Humanitarian Summit in May brought \r\nfocus to several important areas of humanitarian policy, \r\nsuch as protracted conflicts, internally displaced \r\npersons, localization, the relief-to-development \r\nnexus, cash transfers, education and the inclusion \r\nof disabled people. This year also marks the twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary of the adoption of resolution 46/182, \r\non strengthening the coordination of humanitarian \r\nemergency assistance.\r\nOur remarks will concentrate on respect for \r\ninternational humanitarian law, the link between the \r\n2030 Agenda and humanitarian action, the significance \r\ntoday of resolution 46/182, and two particular groups of \r\nvulnerable people, namely, internally displaced persons \r\nand missing persons.\r\nThe need to generate greater respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law has rightly been an important priority \r\nin United Nations policy-making during 2016. Countless \r\nattacks on health-care facilities and health-care workers \r\nled to the adoption of Security Council resolution 2286 \r\n(2016), which included a strong reaffirmation of the \r\nimportance and relevance of the laws protecting health-\r\ncare delivery in situations of armed conflict. More \r\nbroadly, violations of international humanitarian law \r\nby State and non-State armed groups have continued \r\nacross many armed conflicts. Humanitarian access has \r\nremained deeply problematic in several contexts. States’ \r\nefforts to respect and ensure respect for international \r\nhumanitarian law need to be significantly improved.\r\nThe agreement on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment is a major achievement by States, \r\nbut the Agenda must not obscure the distinct role \r\nof humanitarian action. It is not the main purpose \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.57\r\n16-42551 11/19\r\nof humanitarian action to meet the sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals (SDGs), and the ICRC does not \r\npursue a particular ideology of political, economic \r\nor social progress. Our action focuses on need alone. \r\nHowever, principled humanitarian action may make a \r\nspecial contribution to meeting the basic human needs \r\nidentified in the SDGs, especially for people left behind \r\nin armed conflicts. Many of the basic human needs \r\nprioritized in the SDGs — such safety, nutrition, health, \r\nwater, education, livelihoods and legal protection — are \r\nalso prioritized in international humanitarian law and \r\nhumanitarian action.\r\nIn protracted conflicts, humanitarian action can \r\nhold together development infrastructure and services \r\nat a basic level and even function as a safety net. Smart \r\ncollaboration between humanitarian actors, public \r\nauthorities, development institutions and businesses \r\ncan enable some continuity of the SDGs during and \r\nafter armed conflict, but humanitarian action is not \r\ndevelopment or peacebuilding, which tend to have \r\npolitical goals.\r\nResolution 46/182 remains important today. \r\nIt recognizes State sovereignty and prioritizes the \r\nrole and responsibility of States in the facilitation of \r\nneutral and impartial humanitarian action. It also \r\nrecognizes the importance of respecting international \r\nhumanitarian law and the vital additional role of \r\nprincipled humanitarian organizations in strengthening \r\nhumanitarian response.\r\nOur operational experience is clear. This \r\ncombination of a responsible and actively engaged State \r\nallowing and facilitating principled humanitarian action \r\nworks best to protect and assist the victims of armed \r\nconflict. When States embrace their humanitarian \r\nresponsibilities, the ICRC is better able to reach people \r\nand to support or provide the services they need. An \r\neffective Government is often the difference between \r\nhumanitarian success and humanitarian failure.\r\nFinally, our operations suggest that two groups \r\nof people deserve significant attention in global \r\nhumanitarian policy today: urban internally displaced \r\npersons (IDPs) and missing people and their families. \r\nUrban IDPs form a growing category of people whose \r\nconditions require a more coordinated response. The \r\nmajority of the world’s IDPs now live in urban areas, \r\nusually alongside urban poor. IDPs and their host \r\ncommunities share many similar needs. States should \r\nfocus more effort on integrating urban IDPs and their \r\nhost communities into improved basic services and \r\nlivelihood opportunities. We welcome the commitment \r\nof the World Bank and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme to partner with Governments, municipal \r\nauthorities and humanitarian organizations to support \r\nState capacity to meet the needs of IDPs.\r\nMissing people and their families also require \r\nbetter coordination of humanitarian services. Here, \r\nICRC is facing increasing needs as missing migrants \r\nare added to people missing in armed conflicts. The \r\nemotional pain and socioeconomic impact felt by their \r\nfamilies is deep and lasting. People need a concerted \r\neffort on the part of States to enable and link up the \r\nsearch for missing people. ICRC stands ready to support \r\nthese greater efforts.\r\nThe year 2017 will be taken up with the important \r\nwork of rolling out new global policies agreed this year \r\nand developing the compacts on migrants and refugees. \r\nThe humanitarian role and responsibilities of States \r\nmust remain central and in line with their obligations \r\nunder international and domestic law. The need to \r\nclarify the relationship between humanitarian action \r\nand Agenda 2030 will be key. But the needs of people, \r\nlike IDPs and the missing, must remain at the heart of \r\nnew humanitarian policies.\r\nThe Acting President: We shall now proceed \r\nto consider draft resolutions A/71/L.28, A/71/L.31, \r\nA/71/L.32, A/71/L.33 and A/71/L.34 and draft \r\namendments A/71/L.36 and A/71/L.37.\r\nBefore proceeding further, and in view of the desire \r\nof members to dispose of this item expeditiously, I should \r\nlike to consult the Assembly with a view to proceeding \r\nimmediately to consider draft resolutions A/71/L.32, \r\nA/71/L.33 and A/71/L.34 and draft amendments \r\nA/71/L.36 and A/71/L.37. In this connection, since \r\nthe draft resolutions and draft amendments were not \r\ncirculated until this morning, it would be necessary \r\nto waive the relevant provision of rule 78 of the rules \r\nof procedure of the General Assembly, which reads \r\nas follows:\r\n“As a general rule, no proposal shall be \r\ndiscussed or put to the vote at any meeting of the \r\nGeneral Assembly unless copies of it have been \r\ncirculated to all delegations not later than the day \r\npreceding the meeting.”\r\nA/71/PV.57 08/12/2016\r\n12/19 16-42551\r\nUnless I hear any objection, I shall take it that the \r\nAssembly agrees with the earlier proposal that I made \r\nto waive a provision of the rules of procedure.\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor for \r\nexplanations of vote or position before the voting, may I \r\nremind delegations that explanations of vote are limited \r\nto 10 minutes and should be made by delegations from \r\ntheir seats.\r\nMr. Galbavý (Slovakia): I would like to speak in \r\nexplanation of vote before the voting on draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.34, entitled “Safety and security of humanitarian \r\npersonnel and protection of United Nations personnel”. \r\nI have the honour to speak on behalf of the European \r\nUnion and its member States.\r\nThe United States facilitator of this humanitarian \r\ndraft resolution has made every possible effort to \r\nensure a transparent and inclusive process in which all \r\nviews were taken into account. During the month-long \r\nnegotiation process, all delegations had ample chance to \r\nbe involved. Unfortunately, after we reached consensus \r\non the draft text, as presented today, the delegation of \r\nthe Sudan proposed an amendment to the twenty-sixth \r\npreambular paragraph and the deletion of operative \r\nparagraph 7. After a new informal reading, all the other \r\ndelegations preferred to stick to the consensus reached \r\nduring the negotiations.\r\nThe references to the International Criminal Court \r\nin the preambular and operative parts have existed \r\nsince 1999, when the first resolution on the safety and \r\nsecurity of humanitarian personnel and the protection \r\nof United Nations personnel was adopted.\r\nWe ask all Member States to vote against the \r\nproposed changes in agreed language from previous \r\nyears for the following reasons. First, the Rome Statute \r\nof the International Criminal Court is the only standing \r\nlegal instrument in which attacks directed against \r\npersonnel involved in humanitarian assistance or \r\npeacekeeping missions are explicitly recognized as a \r\nwar crime. That simple factual reference is as relevant \r\nnow as it was in 1999. Referring to an instrument is \r\nstronger than referring in general to international law, \r\nas suggested by the delegation of the Sudan.\r\nSecondly, it is important that the present wording \r\nrecognize the role that the International Criminal \r\nCourt can play in the enforcement of that prohibition. \r\nWe consider the International Criminal Court to be \r\nan indispensable building block in the prevention of \r\nimpunity, including in the case of the war crime of \r\ndirecting attacks against humanitarian assistance \r\npersonnel and peacekeepers. It is for that reason that \r\nthe 28 States members of the European Union will \r\nvote against the amendments, and we urge all other \r\nStates and, in particular, the States parties to the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court to also vote \r\nagainst them.\r\nMr. Mohamed (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): First, I \r\nwould like to reiterate that we support draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.34, on the safety and security of humanitarian \r\npersonnel and protection of United Nations personnel. \r\nWe have voted in favour of the draft resolutions on that \r\nsubject since 1999, and our delegation will continue to \r\ndo so. As the draft resolution relates to humanitarian \r\nassistance, it is particularly important for the text to \r\nbe acceptable to the international community. In that \r\nregard, I would like to note that it is the responsibility \r\nof the sponsors not to introduce controversial issues \r\nthat would require delegations to vote against \r\ncertain paragraphs.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n Humanitarian assistance is premised on principles, \r\nincluding the principles of independence and \r\nimpartiality. We, along with several other delegations, \r\nconsider that they are both absent from the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court. Since \r\n23 November, in all transparency and having broken \r\nthe silence, we have proposed different language in an \r\nattempt to overcome this difference with our partners \r\nand colleagues in the European Union. During those \r\n15 days, we took every available opportunity to try to \r\narrive at agreed language. Unfortunately, the European \r\nUnion insisted on retaining the unamended wording \r\nand overruled the silence procedure the moment we did \r\nthe opposite, thereby giving us no opportunity to put \r\nforward our proposals.\r\n Our first amendment (A/71/L.36) is to the twenty-\r\nsixth preambular paragraph and simply proposes \r\nthe deletion of the words “in the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court, and noting the role that \r\nthe Court can play in appropriate cases in bringing” and \r\ntheir replacement by a general reference that reads “in \r\ninternational law, and expressing resolve to bring”. The \r\nremainder of the sentence can be left as is. That is our \r\nfirst amendment. We are ready to consider any language \r\nthat could assist us in our endeavour. In the past few \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.57\r\n16-42551 13/19\r\ndays, we have submitted other improved language \r\nthat is more acceptable in an effort to overcome the \r\nimpasse on the twenty-sixth preambular paragraph. \r\nUnfortunately, our repeated calls have gone unheeded.\r\nIn the second amendment (A/71/L.37), we propose \r\nthe deletion of paragraph 7, which reads “Also calls \r\nupon all States to consider becoming parties to the \r\nRome Statute of the International Criminal Court”. \r\nWe consider that this wording offers an opportunity to \r\nadvance in a controversial matter that conflicts with \r\nthe purpose of the draft resolution on humanitarian \r\nassistance, because the Court has already proved, \r\nduring its short, 10-year lifespan, that it does not \r\nrespect the principles of independence and impartiality. \r\nWe have brought to the attention of all States Members \r\nof the United Nations the reason we are calling for the \r\ndeletion of any reference to the International Criminal \r\nCourt in this draft resolution.\r\nIt should be noted that the Sudan is a party to \r\nthe four Geneva Conventions and the two Additional \r\nProtocols. Paragraph 5 of article 6 of Protocol II, which \r\nrelates to internal conflicts, expressly refers to the \r\nobligation of the States parties to the Protocol to resort \r\nto amnesty as a measure that will bring peace to a \r\nconflict situation in any given country. Unfortunately, \r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court negates \r\nthat principle of international law. When asked about \r\nthat irregularity and contradiction, the first President \r\nof the Court described it as “constructive ambiguity”. \r\nConstructive ambiguity can be a basis for any political \r\nsituation, but it cannot be the basis for a rule or a statute \r\ngoverning the International Criminal Court.\r\nIn the note we circulated to all delegations, we said \r\nthat the references to the Court lacked relevance to the \r\nsubject matter of the draft resolution and that they were \r\ntherefore invalid. The only purpose of the references \r\nis to try to promote a controversial issue, as we can \r\nclearly see from paragraph 7. Serious concerns about \r\nvalidity, usefulness, integrity, efficiency, corruption, \r\npoliticization and selectivity are being increasingly \r\nvoiced, even among the membership of the Court.\r\nThe General Assembly, the highest organ of the \r\nOrganization, is entrusted with the fulfilment of the \r\nobjectives and purposes of the United Nations, chief \r\namong which are respect for and adherence to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and international law. \r\nIt is noteworthy that the United States of America \r\nand India pointedly affirmed the following in their \r\njoint statement on the eve of the adoption of the Rome \r\nStatute in 1998:\r\n“We are concerned about the international \r\ncriminal treaty with respect to the inadequacy of \r\nchecks and balances, the impact of the treaty on \r\nnational sovereignty and the potential for conflict \r\nwith the United Nations Charter”.\r\nThe Sudan, too, is concerned about any potential \r\nconflict with the United Nations Charter, and, since \r\nthe Statute of the International Criminal Court is at \r\nodds with the Charter, our amendments eliminate the \r\nreferences to the Court.\r\nReference to the Court should not be forced into a \r\ndraft resolution on the protection of humanitarian and \r\nUnited Nations personnel. It seems appropriate to cite \r\nthe Canadian/Irish human rights professor mentioned \r\nin our circular. Mr. William Schabas stated that it is \r\na fact that many States seek to influence the direction \r\nof international justice, and they resist efforts to \r\nstrengthen the independence and impartiality of the \r\njudiciary because it threatens their ability to fulfil such \r\nan agenda. The fact is that they do not want to do so \r\nbecause they would lose control.\r\nIn sum, because of these arguments, I urge Member \r\nStates to vote in favour of our amendments to draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.34, both as regards the wording of the \r\ntwenty-sixth preambular paragraph and the deletion of \r\noperative paragraph 7. I seek guidance as to whether we \r\nwill vote separately on each of those two paragraphs.\r\nThe Acting President: Yes, we will conduct a \r\nseparate vote on each of the two amendments (A/71/L. \r\n36 and A/71/L.37).\r\nMr. Nardi (Liechtenstein): I have the honour to \r\nspeak on behalf of Australia, Canada, Iceland, New \r\nZealand, Norway, Switzerland and my own country, \r\nLiechtenstein.\r\nI would like to remind delegations that the wording \r\nin question is the exact wording agreed on by consensus \r\nin previous years. Concerning the first proposed \r\namendment (A/71/L.36), it is important to stress that \r\nthe twenty-sixth preambular paragraph merely reflects \r\nthe fact that the crimes in question are referred to in the \r\nRome Statute. We find it therefore deeply disturbing \r\nthat the established consensus is now being challenged. \r\nThis is even more distressing since we have been \r\nwitnessing an alarming erosion of the respect for \r\ninternational humanitarian law in recent years, with \r\nA/71/PV.57 08/12/2016\r\n14/19 16-42551\r\nsome of the most disturbing expressions being attacks \r\nagainst humanitarian and medical personnel in conflict \r\nsituations, in violation of international humanitarian \r\nlaw. Therefore, the relevance of the agreed text today is \r\neven greater than in past years, and we strongly insist \r\non the retention of the agreed language.\r\nOn the second proposed amendment (A/71/L.37), \r\nwe want to emphasize that paragraph 7 does not touch \r\nupon each State’s own decision to choose whether to \r\njoin the Rome Statute system, and that therefore the \r\ntext should be kept. We hope that all delegations will \r\njoin us in opposing changes to the consensus language \r\nfrom previous years.\r\nMr. Pronin (Russian Federation) (spoke in Russian): \r\nThe Russian Federation consistently advocates the \r\nprosecution of individuals guilty of having perpetrated \r\ngrave international crimes. Our country was at the \r\norigin of the establishment of the Nuremberg and Tokyo \r\nwar crimes tribunals. We took part in crafting their \r\nCharters. For the same fundamental reasons, Russia \r\nvoted in favour of adopting the Rome Statute, and we \r\nsigned it on 13 September 2000.\r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC), as the first \r\npermanent body of international criminal justice, was \r\nclosely linked to the expectations of the international \r\ncommunity to combat impunity, to settle existing \r\nconflicts and to prevent new hotbeds of tension from \r\narising. To our regret, the Court has failed to meet our \r\nexpectations. It has not become a genuinely independent \r\nand authoritative body of international justice.\r\nThis is a matter of principle. In various forums, \r\nincluding the General Assembly and the Security \r\nCouncil, we have observed the ineffective and one-sided \r\nwork of the Court with respect to the cases on its docket. \r\nThat is borne out by the fact that, in the 14 years of \r\nits work, the ICC has rendered only four judgments; \r\nyet, it has expended more than $1 billion. We therefore \r\nunderstand the initiative taken by the African Union \r\nin deciding to formulate measures for a coordinated \r\nwithdrawal of African States from the Rome Statute.\r\nWe view in a similar light the position of the \r\nSudanese delegation in proposing amendments to the \r\ntwenty-sixth preambular paragraph (A/71/L.36) and \r\nparagraph 7 (A/71/L.37) of draft resolution A/71/L.34, \r\nwhich refer to the role of the International Criminal \r\nCourt and the Rome Statute. From the very outset \r\nof the negotiations on draft resolution A/71/L.34, \r\nour delegation clearly set forth its position on both \r\nparagraphs. We repeat that position once again today. \r\nOur country’s decision to withdraw from the Rome \r\nStatute prevents us from aligning ourselves with the \r\ntwenty-sixth preambular paragraph and paragraph 7 of \r\nthe draft resolution. In that connection, we support the \r\namendments proposed by the Sudan.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote or position before \r\nthe voting.\r\nThe Assembly will now take a decision on draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.28, entitled “Persistent legacy of the \r\nChernobyl disaster”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution, and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.28: Andorra, Argentina, Australia, \r\nChile, China, Colombia, Egypt, Estonia, Georgia, \r\nIceland, India, Italy, Kyrgyzstan, Latvia, Monaco, \r\nNorway, Poland, Romania, San Marino, Slovakia, \r\nSlovenia, Sweden, the Syrian Arab Republic, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.28 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.28 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/125).\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/71/L.31, entitled \r\n“Assistance to the Palestinian people”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution, and in \r\naddition to those delegations listed on the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.31: Albania, Andorra, Australia, \r\nBelarus, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Denmark, Georgia, \r\nGermany, Guatemala, Hungary, Iceland, Japan, \r\nLiechtenstein, Luxembourg, Monaco, Montenegro, \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.57\r\n16-42551 15/19\r\nthe Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, \r\nthe Republic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, San \r\nMarino, Serbia, Sierra Leone, Switzerland, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Ukraine and the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.31 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.31 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/126).\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/71/L.32, entitled \r\n“Strengthening of the coordination of emergency \r\nhumanitarian assistance of the United Nations”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution, and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.32: Albania, Andorra, Argentina, \r\nArmenia, Australia, Austria, Belgium, the Plurinational \r\nState of Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, \r\nBulgaria, Canada, Chile, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cyprus, \r\nthe Czech Republic, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, \r\nEstonia, Fiji, Finland, France, Georgia, Germany, \r\nGreece, Guatemala, Honduras, Hungary, Iceland, \r\nIndonesia, Ireland, Italy, Jamaica, Kenya, Latvia, \r\nLiberia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, \r\nthe Marshall Islands, Mexico, the Federated States of \r\nMicronesia, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, Morocco, \r\nNauru, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, \r\nPalau, Panama, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, the \r\nRepublic of Korea, the Republic of Moldova, Romania, \r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines, Samoa, San Marino, \r\nSerbia, Slovakia, Slovenia, Solomon Islands, Somalia, \r\nSpain, Sweden, Switzerland, Thailand, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Tonga, Tunisia, \r\nTurkey, Ukraine, the United Kingdom of Great Britain \r\nand Northern Ireland, the United States of America, \r\nUruguay, Uzbekistan and Vanuatu.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.32 without a vote?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.32 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/127).\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will \r\nnow take a decision on draft resolution A/71/L.33, \r\nentitled “International cooperation on humanitarian \r\nassistance in the field of natural disasters, from relief \r\nto development”. I give the f loor to the representative \r\nof the Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution, and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.33: Albania, Armenia, Australia, \r\nAustria, Bulgaria, Canada, Croatia, Cyprus, Finland, \r\nFrance, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Japan, \r\nLatvia, Lithuania, Malta, Mexico, Montenegro, the \r\nNetherlands, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, Serbia, \r\nSlovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia, Turkey and the \r\nUnited States of America.\r\nThe Acting President: May I take it that it is the \r\nwish of the General Assembly to adopt draft resolution \r\nA/71/L.33?\r\nDraft resolution A/71/L.33 was adopted (resolution \r\n71/128).\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\ntake a decision on draft resolution A/71/L.34, entitled \r\n“Safety and security of humanitarian personnel and \r\nprotection of United Nations personnel”.\r\nI give the f loor to the representative of \r\nthe Secretariat.\r\nMr. Nakano (Department for General Assembly \r\nand Conference Management): I should like to announce \r\nthat, since the submission of the draft resolution, and \r\nin addition to those delegations listed in the document, \r\nthe following countries have become sponsors of draft \r\nresolution A/71/L.34: Andorra, Argentina, Bosnia \r\nand Herzegovina, Chile, Guatemala, Guinea, Iceland, \r\nMalawi, Mexico, Monaco, Mongolia, Montenegro, \r\nthe Niger, Nigeria, Norway, Panama, the Philippines, \r\nthe Republic of Korea, San Marino, Senegal, Serbia, \r\nSomalia, Turkey and Uruguay.\r\nThe Acting President: In accordance with rule 90 \r\nof the Assembly’s rules of procedure, the Assembly will \r\nfirst take a decision on the proposed draft amendments \r\nA/71/PV.57 08/12/2016\r\n16/19 16-42551\r\nto draft resolution A/71/L.34, issued as documents \r\nA/71/L.36 and A/71/l.37, one by one.\r\nWe will first take action on the draft amendment \r\ncontained in A/71/L.36.

May I remind delegations \r\nthat explanations of vote are limited to 10 minutes and \r\nshould be made by delegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Šorytė (Lithuania): I would like to present \r\nmy country’s explanation of vote on resolution 71/125, \r\nentitled “Persistent legacy of the Chernobyl disaster”.\r\nThirty years after the Chernobyl nuclear \r\ndisaster — one of the biggest disasters in human \r\nhistory — we continue to witness the long-term impact \r\nof Chernobyl, with its humanitarian, environmental, \r\nsocial, economic and health consequences. We \r\nappreciate the efforts of the international community \r\nto mitigate the consequences of the accident. The \r\nsolidarity of regional and global partners in the face \r\nof such accidents is crucial. However, solidarity must \r\nbe genuine and go well beyond mere declarations such \r\nas the Minsk Declaration referred to in the resolution \r\nadopted today.\r\nLithuania remains concerned about the construction \r\nof a nuclear plant in very close proximity to my country, \r\nwithout the provision of full, reliable and transparent \r\ninformation on many aspects of the project, including \r\non how to ensure that provisions under international \r\nconventions and nuclear-safety standards are respected \r\nand implemented, the seismic evaluation of the site, \r\nemergency-preparedness plans and various other \r\ncrucial safety aspects.\r\nAs we remember the tragedy of Chernobyl, we \r\nmust once again stress the urgency of doing everything \r\nwe can in order to avoid and prevent other nuclear \r\ndisaster. The lessons of the Chernobyl disaster force \r\nus to develop nuclear technologies in conformity with \r\nthe spirit and letter of international nuclear-safety and \r\nsecurity requirements. We recognize and respect the \r\nright of States to develop peaceful nuclear programmes. \r\nHowever, this should be done while keeping in mind \r\nthe broader context of transboundary implications and \r\nin full compliance with the rules and requirements of \r\nthe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), the \r\nConvention on Environmental Impact Assessment in \r\na Transboundary Context and other international and \r\nregional bodies.\r\nConfidence-building and ensuring maximum \r\nsafety are crucial for nuclear energy development. \r\nImplementation of stress tests and IAEA safety \r\nstandards, adherence to the Convention on Nuclear \r\nSafety, cooperation with specialized IAEA missions, \r\nincluding Site and External Events Design review \r\nmissions for the entire nuclear cycle, should be integral \r\nparts of each and every nuclear-power programme. \r\nWe call on all countries that develop nuclear energy to \r\nimplement the highest international nuclear-safety and \r\nenvironmental requirements throughout the full nuclear-\r\nfacility cycle in the most comprehensive manner, as it \r\nis the only reliable way to avoid and prevent disasters \r\nsimilar to Chernobyl in future.\r\nThe Acting President: We have heard the last \r\nspeaker in explanation of vote after the voting.\r\nSeveral delegations have asked to speak in exercise \r\nof the right of reply. May I remind Member States \r\nthat statements in the exercise of the right of reply are \r\nlimited to 10 minutes for the first intervention and to \r\nfive minutes for the second intervention and should be \r\nmade by delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Pronin (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): I should like to begin with a general remark on \r\ntoday’s meeting. Sub-item (a) of agenda item 69, which \r\nis the topic of the meeting, focuses on the coordination \r\nof humanitarian assistance. To be frank, we expected \r\nthe meeting to be an opportunity to exchange views on \r\nthe substantive content of the agenda for international \r\ncooperation on humanitarian response. That is what we \r\nbased our statement on.\r\nRegrettably, I must note that we have recently \r\nseen a clear trend towards the politicization of the \r\nhumanitarian dossier, where matters of assistance \r\nto those in need are put on the back burner and what \r\ncomes to the fore are political discussions, unjustified \r\naccusations and exchanges of caustic remarks specific \r\nto specialized committees and the Security Council. \r\nUnfortunately, today’s meeting, which has taken up \r\nthe entire day, has hardly provided an opportunity for \r\na meaningful discussion on the possibility of building \r\ncooperation for humanitarian assistance, which is a \r\ngreat pity.\r\nA/71/PV.57 08/12/2016\r\n18/19 16-42551\r\nI do not wish to delve into a political discussion or \r\nrespond in detail to the statement of the representative \r\nof Ukraine, in which he made some remarks about my \r\ncountry (see A/71/PV.56). However, we do indeed have \r\nsomething to say about the de facto economic blockade \r\nof populations in the Republic and the fact that they are \r\nbeing punished for their unwillingness to acknowledge \r\nthe unconstitutional coup that occurred in the capital. \r\nMembers may refer to our statement on this topic, which \r\nhas been delivered in the Third Committee, the Sixth \r\nCommittee and in other General Assembly meetings. \r\nI should like to call on everyone to focus the \r\ndiscussion on the substantive content of humanitarian \r\ncooperation and meaningful practical initiatives that \r\ncould improve the humanitarian situation in affected \r\ncountries, rather than open up yet another political \r\ndiscussion in this Hall. As we see it, having the latter \r\ndiscussion is not the reason we have come here today.\r\nMr. Amer (Israel) (spoke in Arabic): Today we have \r\nheard numerous accusations levelled against the State \r\nof Israel that ignore realities and distort facts. Attacking \r\nIsrael has become a hobby and pastime of some of our \r\nneighbours that will ultimately prove futile. Attacking \r\nIsrael is a failed attempt to divert attention from the \r\nbrutal crimes perpetrated by the Syrian regime. \r\nFrom this rostrum, the representative of Syria \r\nspoke in a bizarre manner, distorting facts and giving \r\nfree rein to his imagination. The words he used had \r\nlittle connection to reality. Tampering with the truth, \r\nhe uttered lies. His army continues to drop barrel \r\nbombs upon its citizens, including the elderly, children \r\nand women, while Israel has aided and provided health \r\nservices to many innocent injured Syrians. We say now \r\nto the representative of Syria, “While you kill, we treat \r\nthe injured”. The situation has become very clear. Syria \r\nis now mocked in the Arab street. \r\nThe representative of Syria mentioned the so-called \r\noccupied Golan. No comparison can be made between \r\nthe situation in the Golan and the situation in Syria, \r\neither before or after the tragic war. The situation in the \r\nGolan is hundreds of thousands of times better than that \r\nin Syria and other parts of the Arab world with respect \r\nto the provision of services, including welfare, social \r\nservices, employment opportunities, pensions and the \r\neconomic situation.\r\nWe exhort the representative of Syria not to venture \r\nany further down that path.\r\nMr. Lisuchenko (Ukraine): For the sake of time, I \r\nwill be brief. It is obvious that there is a direct causal \r\nlink between Russian actions in Ukraine since February \r\n2014 and the dire humanitarian situation in my country. \r\nThis has been confirmed on numerous occasions \r\nby reports of various United Nations agencies, the \r\nOrganization for Security and Cooperation in Europe \r\nSpecial Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, and during the \r\ndebates heard in the Third and Sixth Committees of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nTo become fully aware of the current humanitarian \r\nsituation in my country, I invite all the delegations \r\nto attend the briefing that will be held by the United \r\nNations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs next week.\r\nMr. Awad (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke in \r\nArabic): The representative of the Government of \r\nIsraeli occupation spoke disparagingly of the situation \r\nin my country, and we have responded to him. However, \r\nour response was not enough for him, so he persists in \r\nmisguiding Member States, believing that the crisis in \r\nmy country will make us forget our arch-enemy, Israel, \r\nthe occupying Power.\r\nMy country is the victim of organized terrorism, \r\nwhich, recalling the actions of Israeli terrorist gangs, is \r\nsimilar to the terrorism used by Israelis to build their \r\ncountry. It is naive to believe in the veracity of the Israeli \r\nrepresentative’s claims that his Government is looking \r\nout for people’s interests. Indeed, the situation reveals \r\nthat for six decades the occupying forces have deprived \r\nthe Arab population of their rights and freedoms. Those \r\nwho occupy the territories of others and who adopt \r\npolicies of starvation, occupation, confiscation of land, \r\nassassinations and killings cannot claim to be listening \r\nto the dictates of their conscience, much less talk about \r\nhumanitarian issues. \r\nIt is very ironic to see the representative of the \r\nbrutal Zionist regime shed crocodile tears over the \r\npopulation of Aleppo and other Syrians, in the light \r\nof the adoption moments ago of resolution 71/126, the \r\nresolution on “Assistance to the Palestinian people”, \r\nwhich addresses the practices of the Israeli regime in \r\nPalestine and other occupied Arab territories.\r\nAt a time when the annals of the Organization \r\nteem with condemnations of the bloody actions taken \r\nby Israel, the occupying Power, against the defenceless \r\nPalestinian people and against our people in the occupied \r\nSyrian Golan and other Arab territories occupied \r\n08/12/2016 A/71/PV.57\r\n16-42551 19/19\r\nsince 1967, we again recall the terrorist role played by \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, in the area of separation, \r\nwhere it is supporting the Islamic State in Iraq and the \r\nLevant and other extremist terrorist organizations. The \r\ncurrent situation, which is clearly described in United \r\nNations reports on the United Nations Disengagement \r\nObserver Force, threatens the separation agreements \r\nand undermines international peace and security in the \r\narea. \r\nIsrael, the occupying Power, intermittently bombs \r\ntargets in my country to boost the morale of the terrorists \r\nit supports. Those who transact with terrorists are \r\nterrorists themselves, as is stated in numerous Security \r\nCouncil resolutions.\r\nThe Acting President: The General Assembly has \r\nthus concluded this stage of its consideration of agenda \r\nitem 69 and its sub-items (a) to (d).\r\nAgenda item 7 (continued)\r\nOrganization of work, adoption of the agenda and \r\nallocation of items\r\nLetter dated 7 December 2016 from the Chair \r\nof the Committee on Conferences addressed \r\nto the President of the General Assembly \r\n(A/71/382/Add.1) \r\nThe Acting President: Members are aware that, \r\npursuant to section 1, paragraph 7, of resolution 40/243, \r\nno subsidiary organ of the General Assembly should \r\nbe permitted to meet at United Nations Headquarters \r\nduring the main part of a regular session of the Assembly, \r\nunless explicitly authorized by the Assembly.\r\nAuthorization is thus sought for the Open-ended \r\nWorking Group on Ageing to meet in New York from \r\n12 to 15 December, during the main part of the seventy-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly, on the strict \r\nunderstanding that all meetings would be allocated \r\nconference services on an as-available basis, from \r\nwithin existing resources, and in such a way that the \r\nwork of the General Assembly and its Main Committees \r\nis not impeded.\r\nMay I take it that it is the wish of the General \r\nAssembly to authorize the Open-ended Working Group \r\non Ageing to meet during the main part of the seventy-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nProgramme of work\r\nThe Acting President: I would like to make the \r\nfollowing announcement concerning the work of the \r\nplenary.
