"United Nations A/71/PV.7\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n7th plenary meeting\r\nMonday, 19 September 2016, 7.30 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 7.40 p.m.\r\nHigh-level plenary meeting on addressing large \r\nmovements of refugees and migrants\r\nAgenda items 13 and 117 (continued)\r\nIntegrated and coordinated implementation \r\nof and follow-up to the outcomes of the major \r\nUnited Nations conferences and summits in the \r\neconomic, social and related fields\r\nFollow-up to the outcome of the Millennium \r\nSummit\r\nCo-Chair Thomson: As we begin the closing \r\nevents of the high-level plenary meeting on addressing \r\nlarge movements of refugees and migrants, it is my \r\npleasure to present the global première of a special \r\nversion of John Lennon’s iconic song, entitled \r\n“Imagine”. A collaboration among UNICEF, Ms. Yoko \r\nOno and French music producer David Guetta, the \r\nvideo brings together thousands of voices from around \r\nthe world to shine a spotlight on issues facing the most \r\nvulnerable people.\r\nWe will now see the video.\r\nA video presentation was broadcast in the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nCo-Chair Thomson: It is now my honour to give \r\nthe f loor to the Deputy Secretary-General, Mr. Jan \r\nEliasson, who will deliver closing remarks that will \r\ninclude a summary of the plenary debate and the six \r\ninteractive multi-stakeholder round tables.\r\nThe Deputy Secretary-General: Today has been \r\na historic day. I do not even have to imagine this. It is \r\na reality, and I think that that wonderful song in this \r\nsetting proves the power of music and culture. Maybe \r\nwe should do more of that in the United Nations.\r\nOn behalf of the Secretary-General, I congratulate \r\nMember States on having adopted by consensus the \r\nNew York Declaration for Refugees and Migrants \r\n(resolution 71/1, annex). This shows that despite \r\ndiffering perspectives, we can unite around common \r\nprinciples and around core commitments to refugees \r\nand migrants. Large movements of refugees and \r\nmigrants present some of the most challenging issues \r\nof our time. Individually, many Member States today \r\nhave demonstrated positive approaches to refugees \r\nand migrants. They have saved the lives of migrants \r\nat sea. They have treated migrants humanely. They \r\nhave extended protection to refugees. Yes, all this is to \r\nbe commended.\r\nHowever, we know that no one State can deal with \r\nthese transnational issues by acting alone. We must \r\nwork together, more than ever before. The situation \r\ntoday requires urgent attention and urgent action. \r\nToday, we have heard moving accounts that brought to \r\nthis beautiful Hall the stark reality of being a refugee or \r\na migrant — suffering in times of war, the unimaginable \r\nsexual violence and exploitation and the experience of \r\nalienation and discrimination in a new land. But they \r\nalso told us about the rebuilding of their lives, about \r\ntheir skills and capacities finally being used and about \r\nhow the global community needs to act.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

They have committed to \r\ntackling the discrimination and gender-based violence \r\nthat women and girls face everywhere. Many have \r\nhighlighted the negative consequence of irregular \r\nmigration. They have called for greater cooperation \r\nto address the despicable human trafficking and \r\nsmuggling of migrants and refugees. States have also \r\nrecognized the strain on countries that host large \r\nnumbers of refugees. They have agreed to implement \r\na comprehensive response to large refugee movements, \r\nnot least in protracted crisis situations.\r\nToday, several representatives have also shared plans \r\nto expand financial assistance, taking into account both \r\nthe humanitarian and the development aspects. New \r\nfinancial mechanisms have been announced to increase \r\nsupport to host countries and host communities. We \r\nhave heard concrete examples of the private sector \r\ncreating jobs for refugees, and how Member States have \r\nsupported such efforts. It has been encouraging to hear \r\nthat additional countries have joined in the efforts to \r\nprovide resettlement space or alternative pathways for \r\nthe admission of refugees.\r\nWe must also rally behind the call in the Declaration \r\nto ensure that all migrant and refugee girls and boys \r\nhave access to education within a few months of their \r\narrival. It was widely recognized that we must increase \r\nfinancial support for the education of refugee children \r\nand youth.\r\nDevelopment programmes are also crucial and a key \r\npriority. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nrecognized the contribution that migration makes to \r\neconomic and social progress. We must harness that \r\npositive energy. To do so requires improved data on \r\nmigration patterns and impacts, as many speakers \r\nhave emphasized.\r\nWe also require a clear-headed and informed \r\npolicy debate, one that avoids stigmatizing refugees or \r\nmigrants. The Secretary-General’s launch this morning \r\nof a global campaign to combat xenophobia, entitled \r\n“Together — Respect, Safety and Dignity for All”, \r\nis receiving broad support and affirmation. We look \r\nforward to working with Member States and partners \r\non that project.\r\nToday, many Member States have declared their \r\nintention to incorporate refugees and migrants in \r\nnational development planning. That will foster more \r\ncoherent planning and break down the silos that isolate \r\nhumanitarian assistance from development work, which \r\nis such a crucial task for all of us. At the same time, we \r\nmust ensure that commitments for official development \r\nassistance are being met. Creating jobs and investing \r\nin youth are critical for making migration a choice, not \r\na necessity.\r\nWith regard to attaining peace and security, it is \r\nwith great hope and anticipation that we have heard \r\nin this Hall a strong call for prevention and resolution \r\nof armed conflicts. Violent conflicts are often the \r\nsource of mass displacement, as we all know. Acting \r\nearly and with foresight and responsibility must be a \r\nguiding principle for our work. The shocking images \r\nwe see and the human stories we hear touch all of us \r\naround the world. Therefore, we must look not only to \r\nGovernments, but also to others for action. Civil society \r\nand the private sector have shown engagement and \r\ntaken innovative approaches when faced with refugee \r\nand migrant movements.\r\nWe acknowledge the many steps and tasks on the \r\nroad ahead, such as agreeing on how to govern migration \r\neffectively, learning how to successfully integrate \r\nrefugees and migrants into our societies, and how to \r\nincrease cooperation to assist migrants in vulnerable \r\nsituations. Given the urgency of all these challenges, \r\nthe implementation of the New York Declaration for \r\nRefugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1, annex) must \r\nbegin now, at home and internationally.\r\nMember States have set critical deadlines. By 2018, \r\nwe aim to have adopted a global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration — a formula that, by the \r\nway, is also taken from the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. We also want to achieve a more equitable \r\nsharing of the responsibility for hosting and supporting \r\nthe world’s refugees by adopting a global compact on \r\nrefugees in 2018.\r\nThe United Nations system will now mobilize for \r\na comprehensive follow-up process. We have taken \r\nan important step today by bringing the International \r\nOrganization for Migration into the United Nations \r\nsystem as a related organization. In so doing, we \r\nrecognize its unique and valuable contribution to the \r\nwork of the United Nations on migration. That makes \r\nthe United Nations system stronger as we rise to meet \r\nour new challenges and to seize opportunities. The \r\nNew York Declaration calls for ongoing follow-up of \r\n19/09/2016 A/71/PV.7\r\n16-29168 3/3\r\nour commitments. It would be helpful to take stock \r\na year from now to ensure that we are on track for \r\nmeeting our objectives by 2018. As one of our young \r\nrefugee speakers reminded us this morning, refugees \r\nare already taking action; now is the time for the \r\ninternational community to act.\r\nIn closing, let me say that it will take determined \r\nand collective efforts to address large movements of \r\nrefugees and migrants in the world. We need to prevent \r\nand speedily resolve political crises. We need to respond \r\nto humanitarian crises. We need to engage in informed \r\npolicy debate, as we have started to do today. We need \r\nto protect the human rights of all. We need to address \r\nroot causes and ensure that no one is left behind. And \r\nwe need to counter polarizing forces that aim to instil \r\nfear and divide us into “us” and “them”.\r\nSome of the refugees and migrants who joined us \r\ntoday suffered terrible ordeals. They have demonstrated \r\ncourage, resilience and offered a measure of hope. We \r\nmust respond by carrying out the New York Declaration \r\nin that same spirit. Together — and “together” \r\nis perhaps the most important word in the world \r\ntoday — we can shape a new future. This must be a \r\nfuture in which migrants and refugees, host nations and \r\nhost communities can live together in harmony, well-\r\nbeing and mutual respect, and today Member States \r\nhave started this work. Let us go to work together.\r\nCo-Chair Thomson: I thank the Deputy Secretary-\r\nGeneral for his statement.\r\nI shall now make a few brief remarks before closing.\r\nI join in thanking all Member States for their high \r\nlevel of participation in today’s summit; it ref lects the \r\ngravity of the situation before us and our collective \r\ncommitment to finding humane global solutions to \r\naddress this crisis. But our actions must not stop here.\r\nWe must move quickly to fulfil the commitments \r\nmade today. We must continue to give the refugee and \r\nmigrant crisis the attention, energy and support that \r\nit needs. We must redouble our efforts to protect the \r\nhuman rights of refugees and migrants. We must counter \r\nracism, xenophobia and others forms of intolerance \r\nthat seek to dehumanize vulnerable people in need. \r\nMost importantly, we must push for the universal \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which will help to address many of the \r\nroot causes that drive people to f lee.\r\nI stand ready to work with Member States, the \r\nUnited Nations system, civil society and other key \r\nstakeholders throughout the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-first session so that we may find durable \r\nsolutions that meet this moral imperative of our time. \r\nAs I said in my opening remarks this morning,\r\n“I urge Member States to maintain their high \r\nlevels of ambition throughout these processes and \r\nto always reach for the higher ground on the basis \r\nof our common humanity and our values of decency \r\nand equality. The well-being of millions rests with \r\nus at the United Nations, and we must not fail them \r\nin their hour of need”(A/71/PV.3, p. 2).\r\nI cannot close this evening without congratulating \r\nMember States and all those who made possible \r\nthe adoption today of the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1, annex). \r\nI see many of them in the Hall this evening, and I \r\nacknowledge their presence. On behalf of migrants and \r\nrefugees everywhere, I thank everyone.\r\nI now declare closed the high-level plenary meeting \r\non addressing large movements of refugees and \r\nmigrants.\r\nThe meeting rose at 7.55 p.m.\r\n"
