"United Nations A/71/PV.8\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-first session\r\n8th plenary meeting\r\nTuesday, 20 September 2016, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Thomson . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Fiji)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9.05 a.m.\r\nAgenda item 109\r\nReport of the Secretary-General on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/71/1)\r\nThe President: In accordance with the decision \r\ntaken at its 2nd plenary meeting, on 16 September 2016, \r\nthe General Assembly will hear a presentation by the \r\nSecretary-General of his annual report on the work of \r\nthe Organization (A/71/1), under agenda item 109.\r\nI give the f loor to the Secretary-General.\r\nThe Secretary-General: I stand before the \r\nAssembly today with gratitude for the support I have \r\nbeen given across the decade during which I have had \r\nthe privilege to serve the great Organization of the \r\nUnited Nations. In taking the oath of office in December \r\n2006, I pledged to work with the Organization for “we, \r\nthe peoples”. With the Charter of the United Nations \r\nas our guide and the dedication of the staff, we have \r\nachieved much together.\r\nI also stand here in deep concern. Gulfs of mistrust \r\ndivide citizens from their leaders. Extremists push \r\npeople into camps of “us” and “them”. The Earth assails \r\nus with rising seas, record heat and extreme storms. \r\nAnd danger defines the days of many. One hundred and \r\nthirty million people need lifesaving assistance; tens of \r\nmillions of them are children and young people, so that \r\nour next generation already at risk.\r\nYet after 10 years in office, I am more convinced \r\nthan ever that we have the power to end war, poverty \r\nand persecution. We have the means to prevent conflict. \r\nWe have the potential to close the gap between rich and \r\npoor, and to make rights a reality in people’s lives. \r\nWith the Sustainable Development Goals, we have a \r\nmanifesto for a better future. With the Paris Agreement \r\non climate change, we are tackling the defining \r\nchallenge of our time. We have no time to lose. I urge all \r\nthe leaders here to bring the Paris Agreement into force \r\nbefore the end of this year. We need just 26 countries \r\nmore, representing just 15 per cent of greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions. I ask all those here to help lead us to a world \r\nof low-carbon growth, increased resilience and greater \r\nopportunity and well-being for our children.\r\nThose great gains are threatened by grave security \r\nthreats. Armed conflicts have grown more protracted \r\nand complex. Governance failures have pushed societies \r\npast the brink. Radicalization has threatened social \r\ncohesion, which is precisely the response that violent \r\nextremists seek and welcome. The tragic consequences \r\nare on brutal display from Yemen to Libya and Iraq, \r\nfrom Afghanistan to the Sahel and the Lake Chad basin.\r\nIn today’s world, the conflict in Syria is taking \r\nthe greatest number of lives and sowing the widest \r\ninstability. There is no military solution. Many groups \r\nhave killed many innocents, but none more so than the \r\nGovernment of Syria, which continues to barrel-bomb \r\nneighbourhoods and systematically torture thousands \r\nof detainees. Powerful patrons who keep feeding the \r\nwar machine also have blood on their hands. Present \r\nin this Hall today are representatives of Governments \r\nthat have ignored, facilitated, funded, participated in \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n16-29296 (E)\r\n*1629296*\r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n2/56 16-29296\r\nand even planned and carried out atrocities inflicted on \r\nSyrian civilians by every side in the Syria conflict.\r\nJust when we think it cannot get any worse, the \r\nbar of depravity sinks lower. Yesterday’s sickening, \r\nsavage and apparently deliberate attack on a United \r\nNations-Syrian Arab Red Crescent aid convoy is the \r\nlatest example. The United Nations has been forced \r\nto suspend aid convoys as a result of that outrage. The \r\nhumanitarians delivering life-saving aid were heroes. \r\nThose who bombed them were cowards. Accountability \r\nfor crimes such as these is essential. I appeal to all \r\nthose with influence to end the fighting and get talks \r\nstarted. A political transition is long overdue. After so \r\nmuch violence and misrule, the future of Syria should \r\nnot rest on the fate of a single man.\r\nOne year ago, Palestine proudly raised its f lag at \r\nUnited Nations Headquarters, yet the prospects for a \r\ntwo-State solution are decreasing every day, while the \r\noccupation grinds into its fiftieth year. As a friend of \r\nboth the Israeli and Palestinian peoples, it pains me \r\nthat the past decade has been 10 years lost to peace; 10 \r\nyears lost to illegal settlement expansion; 10 years lost \r\nto intra-Palestinian divide, growing polarization and \r\nhopelessness. This is madness. Replacing a two-State \r\nsolution with a one-State construct would spell doom, \r\ndenying Palestinians their freedom and rightful future, \r\nand pushing Israel further from its vision of a Jewish \r\ndemocracy towards greater global isolation.\r\nOn the Korean peninsula, the fifth nuclear test \r\nconducted by the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea has again threatened regional and international \r\nsecurity. Meanwhile, their people’s suffering and plight \r\nare worsening. I urge the leaders of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea to change course and fulfil \r\ntheir obligations — to their own people and to the \r\nfamily of nations.\r\nIn Ukraine, the violence has caused an internal \r\nupheaval, renewed tensions across Europe and rekindled \r\ngeopolitical rivalries. In South Sudan, leaders have \r\nalso betrayed their people. Indeed, in too many places, \r\nwe see leaders rewriting constitutions, manipulating \r\nelections and taking other desperate steps to cling to \r\npower. Those who hold office must understand that it \r\nis a privilege entrusted to them by the people, not their \r\npersonal property. My message to all is clear — serve \r\nthe people, do not subvert democracy, do not pilfer \r\nthe country’s resources and do not imprison and \r\ntorture critics.\r\nYesterday we made great progress in helping people \r\nfind a haven from conflict and tyranny. The New York \r\nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants (resolution 71/1) \r\npoints the way toward saving lives and protecting the \r\nrights of millions of people. We all must meet those \r\npromises. All too often, refugees and migrants face \r\nhatred. Muslims in particular are being targeted by \r\nstereotyping and suspicion that evoke haunting echoes \r\nof the dark past. I urge political leaders and candidates to \r\nnot engage in the cynical and dangerous political math \r\nof adding votes by dividing people and multiplying fear. \r\nThe world must stand up against lies and distortions of \r\ntruth, and reject all forms of discrimination.\r\nWe must also address the factors that compel \r\npeople to move. That means investing in conflict \r\nprevention and engaging in patient diplomacy. As the \r\ndemand for peacekeeping rises, we must continue \r\nstrengthening peace operations to help countries secure \r\nand maintain peace. I am encouraged that the General \r\nAssembly has endorsed the Plan of Action to Prevent \r\nViolent Extremism, which can help us tackle the drivers \r\nof conflict.\r\nIn Myanmar, the transition has entered a promising \r\nnew phase. In Sri Lanka, post-war healing efforts \r\nhave deepened. In both countries, true reconciliation \r\nrests on ensuring that all communities, minorities \r\nand majorities alike, are included in building a real \r\nunion. Next Monday, I will travel to Colombia for the \r\nsigning of a peace agreement to end one of the world’s \r\nlongest-running armed conflicts. The United Nations \r\nwill support the Colombian people every step of the \r\nway. There is also encouraging momentum towards an \r\nagreement on Cyprus. Let us all support the progress \r\nand solutions that may now be at hand.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI take this opportunity to express my regrets on \r\ntwo matters that have tarnished the Organization’s \r\nreputation, and far worse, have traumatized the many \r\npopulations we serve.\r\nFirst of all, the despicable acts of exploitation and \r\nsexual violence committed by some peacekeeping \r\nsoldiers and other United Nations personnel have \r\ncompounded the suffering of people already embroiled \r\nin armed conflict and have undermined the efforts of \r\nso many other United Nations agencies worldwide. \r\nThose who would protect must never become predators. \r\nMember States and the Secretariat must redouble their \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 3/56\r\nefforts to enforce and bolster the Organization’s zero-\r\ntolerance policy.\r\nSecondly, Haiti has been sorely tested. Shortly \r\nafter a devastating earthquake, the country was hit \r\nby a cholera outbreak. I am deeply saddened by the \r\nterrible suffering of the Haitian people affected by \r\ncholera. We must devise a new approach to ease their \r\nplight and improve their living conditions. We are \r\nfirmly resolved to take sustainable action to shoulder \r\nthat moral responsibility. We are currently drafting a \r\nset of measures to assist those most directly affected, \r\nand we are intensifying efforts to set up robust water, \r\nsanitation and health systems, which is the best long-\r\nterm protection against disease. We cannot succeed \r\nwithout the unwavering political and financial \r\nsupport of Member States. Details on that strategy \r\nare forthcoming. Let us pool our efforts to honour our \r\nobligations to the Haitian people.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAllow me to briefly touch on a few other areas that \r\nI hope will long remain priorities of the United Nations.\r\nI am proud that UN-Women came to life during my \r\ntenure. It is now our established champion of gender \r\nequality and empowerment, seeking to bring about a \r\n50-50 planet. I have appointed more women to senior \r\npositions at the United Nations than ever before — and \r\nI am proud to call myself a feminist. Women hold up \r\nhalf the sky and are essential to meeting all our goals. \r\nI have always said that the least utilized resource in \r\nthe world is the potential of women. So we must do far \r\nmore to end deep-seated discrimination and chronic \r\nviolence against women, to advance their participation \r\nin decision-making and to ensure that every girl gets \r\nthe start in life she deserves.\r\nI have been a proud defender of the rights of all \r\npeople, regardless of ethnicity, religion or sexual \r\norientation. Our human rights machinery, along with \r\nthe Human Rights Up Front initiative, is placing human \r\nrights at the centre. Human rights are the pillars of \r\nsociety and the antidotes to violent extremism and \r\ncivic despair.\r\nWe have deepened support for the responsibility to \r\nprotect. We have made inroads against the death penalty. \r\nLandmark convictions by the International Criminal \r\nCourt and other bodies have advanced accountability, \r\nbut we still must do far more to prevent genocide and \r\nother atrocity crimes. Civil society is essential to all of \r\nthese efforts.\r\nI ask all present to join me today in saying “yes” to \r\ngreater space for civil society and independent media, \r\nand “no” to cracking down on the freedoms of assembly \r\nand expression.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn the past 10 years, we have made great progress in \r\neducation and health. Polio has almost been eradicated, \r\nmore women survive childbirth, and more children are \r\nin school and live longer, better lives. Our collective \r\nresponse to the Ebola outbreak has prepared us for \r\nfuture health emergencies. The work of the Global \r\nHealth Crises Task Force reminds us that vigilance \r\nmust start well before pandemics reach the front pages. \r\nThe control of deadly weapons advanced thanks to \r\nthe Convention on Cluster Munitions, the Arms Trade \r\nTreaty and effective action against chemical weapons.\r\nWe need to build on this momentum to move closer \r\nto the goal of eliminating nuclear weapons once and \r\nfor all. The World Humanitarian Summit strengthened \r\nrelief efforts to focus on prevention and resilience as \r\nwell as on reducing need. We are tapping the energies \r\nof young people as never before, including thanks to the \r\nwork of my first-ever United Nations Envoy on Youth as \r\nwell as the new Special Envoy on Youth Employment. \r\nPartnerships with the private sector have multiplied. \r\nWe have pushed for responsible practices that harness \r\nthe best of business for society and the world, and we \r\nhave made important strides in adapting and reforming \r\nthe United Nations for the twenty-first century.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nContinued progress will require new heights of \r\nsolidarity. Sometimes we are our own worst enemies. \r\nMember States have still not agreed on a formula \r\nfor reform of the Security Council, which poses a \r\ncontinuing risk to its effectiveness and legitimacy.\r\nIn the same spirit, I want to put on the table today \r\na major and much-needed reform for fairness and \r\neffectiveness in the United Nations. Far too often, I \r\nhave seen widely supported proposals blocked, in the \r\nname of consensus, by a few or sometimes even just \r\none country. We see this being done by large and small \r\ncountries alike. Time and again, I have seen essential \r\naction and good ideas blocked in the Security Council, \r\nblocked in the General Assembly, blocked in the budget \r\nprocess, blocked in the Conference on Disarmament \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n4/56 16-29296\r\nand other bodies. We see this being done by large and \r\nsmall countries alike.\r\nIs it fair, in this complicated twenty-first century, \r\nfor any one country, or a few countries, to yield such \r\ndisproportionate power and hold the world hostage on \r\nso many important issues?\r\nConsensus should not be confused with unanimity. \r\nThe global public is right to ask whether this is how an \r\nOrganization in which we have invested so much hope \r\nand so many aspirations should function. I propose, \r\nMr. President, that you explore, with my successor, the \r\nestablishment of a high-level panel to find practical \r\nsolutions that will improve decision-making at the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nStates must also respect the independence of the \r\nSecretariat, in accordance with the Charter. When \r\nour reports say what needs to be said, Member States \r\nshould not try to rewrite history. When our human \r\nrights personnel act on behalf of the most vulnerable, \r\nMember States should not block their path. When our \r\nhumanitarian workers need to reach populations under \r\nsiege, Member States should remove all obstacles. And \r\nwhen our envoys and personnel raise difficult issues, \r\nMember States should not ostracize them or threaten to \r\nbanish them from the country. We must all be open and \r\naccountable to the people we serve.\r\nThere is one last measure of the change that has \r\ndefined the past decade.\r\nIt is hard to believe, but when I took office, a \r\nsmartphone like this had not even been introduced to \r\nthe world. Today it is a lifeline and perhaps, at times, \r\nthe bane of our existence. It is an indispensable part of \r\nour lives. Our phones and social media have connected \r\nthe world in ways that were unimaginable when I \r\ntook office. Yes, they have been abused by extremists \r\nand hate groups. But they have also created a world \r\nof new communities and opportunities. For me, it is \r\nall a reminder of the power of individuals to change \r\nthe world.\r\nAfter all, people power helped make the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development (resolution 70/1) \r\nthe most inclusive development process of our time. \r\nPeople power mobilized millions to push leaders to \r\ntake climate action. People power is what I have seen \r\nin every corner of the world this past decade: people \r\nlike Rebecca Johnson, a nurse I met in Sierra Leone \r\nwho contracted Ebola, recovered and then risked her \r\nlife again to save her community; and people like \r\nYusra Mardini, the Syrian teen swimmer who pushed \r\nher damaged refugee boat to safety and then went on to \r\ncompete in the Olympic Games; and, of course, people \r\nlike young Malala Yousafzai, who came to the United \r\nNations and showed us all how one book, one pen and \r\none person could make a difference.\r\nA perfect world may be on the far horizon, but the \r\nroute to a better world, a safer world, a more trusted \r\nworld, is in each and every one of us. Ten years on, I \r\nknow that, working together, working united, we can get \r\nthere. I count on members’ leadership and commitment.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI thank the Secretary-General for his statement.\r\nStatement by the President\r\nThe President: It is my privilege today to open the \r\ngeneral debate of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nfirst session. In exercising this privilege, I am greatly \r\nhumbled, as a proud Fijian citizen, to know that this is \r\nthe first time in the seven decades of the history of the \r\nUnited Nations that a President of the Assembly has \r\nhailed from one of the Pacific island nations.\r\nThree hundred and sixty-one days ago in this great \r\nHall, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nwas adopted. The result of two years of intense, \r\nmultilateral negotiations, the 2030 Agenda’s adoption \r\nwas like a beacon of hope raised to guide all humankind \r\nto a better world. With its 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs), the 2030 Agenda is hugely ambitious. \r\nImbued with a universal and transformative spirit, the \r\n2030 Agenda sets out a master plan for us to transform \r\nour world into one in which extreme poverty has been \r\neliminated and peaceful, well governed societies live \r\nsustainably and in harmony with our environment. \r\nEssentially, it provides for a future in which generations \r\nto come will live securely in a loving world.\r\nHow are we progressing? Our first great indication \r\nof progress is that the Paris Agreement on climate \r\nchange was adopted in Paris and we are moving steadily \r\ntowards its ratification. I salute the Secretary-General \r\nfor his tireless work in that area and congratulate \r\nthe Governments that have ratified the Agreement. \r\nOvercoming the challenges of climate change is the \r\nexistential responsibility of our time. We must not \r\ndelay any further, and it is encouraging to see that \r\nmore energy is being produced from more affordable, \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 5/56\r\nrenewable sources than ever before, and more resources \r\nare going to climate adaptation.\r\nIt is heartening to see that the number of people \r\nliving in extreme poverty and suffering from \r\ncommunicable diseases, like polio and malaria, \r\ncontinues to decrease. It is evident that the 2030 \r\nAgenda is being increasingly used as the framework for \r\nimproved national development plans around the world. \r\nBut we are far from where we need to be.\r\nMillions of people around the globe are suffering \r\nthe brutal effects of war. The crisis in Syria continues \r\nto bring immense human suffering to the Syrian people, \r\nfor both those who have f led in search of sanctuary and \r\nthose who have stayed under inhumane conditions. I \r\nstrongly condemn the attacks on a United Nations \r\naid convoy that was seeking to bring desperately \r\nneeded food and medical supplies to people in need. \r\nThe deliberate targeting of humanitarian personnel \r\nis a f lagrant violation of international law and totally \r\nmorally unacceptable.\r\nAround the world, more than 60 million people are \r\non the move, many risking their lives to f lee conflict or \r\ndisaster. Week after week, innocent people are falling \r\nvictim to the despicable acts of violent extremists. The \r\ngap between rich and poor, between men and women, \r\nbetween developing countries and advanced economies \r\nremains stubbornly high. At a time when collaboration \r\nand partnership are needed more than ever, we are \r\nwitnessing increasing xenophobia, divisive rhetoric and \r\nattacks on our human rights and fundamental freedoms. \r\nMeanwhile, global greenhouse-gas emissions continue \r\nto rise. Incredible damage is being done to our oceans \r\nand seas, and the window of opportunity to avert \r\ncatastrophic climate change is rapidly closing.\r\nTaken together, it is clear that the 2030 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Agenda is not yet producing the results \r\nthat our world so desperately needs. What are we \r\ntherefore going to do about it? There is only one answer: \r\nwe must do better to accelerate the implementation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals. We need to \r\nteach our young people about the Goals, because for \r\nthe required transformation to occur, it must first take \r\nhold in our minds and in our values. It is our children \r\nwho will be the inheritors of the Agenda’s results, so \r\nevery classroom around the world should be teaching \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. I encourage all \r\nmembers to achieve that reality. Greater public resources \r\nmust be dedicated to achieving the SDGs, either \r\ndirectly through domestic finance or through official \r\ndevelopment assistance such as climate financing. We \r\nneed to create better regulatory environments and to \r\nrequire the international financial system to ensure that \r\nfinancing is increasingly focused on productive, green \r\nand socially responsible investment. We must support \r\ngreater access for poor and marginalized communities \r\nand countries to science, technology and innovation, \r\nto trade opportunities and to more sustainable debt \r\nsolutions. We can, and must, work better on sustaining \r\npeace, preventing and responding to conflict and in \r\nmanaging the global humanitarian and refugee crisis.\r\nCollective action by Member States must be \r\nadvanced. Strategic and inclusive partnerships must be \r\nforged to meet the global challenges we face — from \r\nclimate change to conflict, from violent extremism \r\nand terrorism to the contagious diseases that threaten \r\nhumankind. As President of the General Assembly, I \r\nassure the Assembly that I will do everything possible \r\nto support members in addressing those issues during \r\nthe seventy-first session.\r\nIn summary, during the seventy-first session I am \r\ncommitted to a universal push for the implementation \r\nof all 17 SDGs. I will push for a United Nations \r\ndevelopment system that works seamlessly as one and \r\nthat responds effectively to the needs of Member States \r\nfor which United Nations support is essential.\r\nIn response to the crisis our beloved ocean is facing, \r\nI will oversee the preparations for the United Nations \r\nconference on SDG 14, on oceans, to be held here in \r\nthe Hall and in the surrounding conference rooms from \r\n5 to 9 June 2017. We are building the conference to be \r\nthe game-changer for the way we safeguard our ocean’s \r\nwell-being, and I hope to see as many members attend \r\nas possible.\r\nBeyond the 2030 Agenda, as President of the General \r\nAssembly, I am fully conscious of the responsibilities, \r\nfunctions and powers of this organ under Chapter IV \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations. Next week, I will \r\ntravel to Colombia for the historic signing of the peace \r\nagreement between the Government of Colombia and \r\nthe Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia — a \r\nwelcome agreement ending decades of civil conflict.\r\nIt is my hope that, in collaboration with Member \r\nStates and the wider United Nations community, it will \r\nalso prove possible over the coming months to take \r\nsteps to advance other pressing agendas before the \r\nOrganization: to strengthen the United Nations peace \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n6/56 16-29296\r\nand security pillar by enhancing the Organization’s \r\nability to prevent and respond to conflicts and threats; \r\nto advance the sustaining peace agenda as fundamental \r\nto the United Nations engagement across peace and \r\nsecurity, development and human rights — there can be, \r\nafter all, no sustainable development without sustainable \r\npeace; to combat discrimination and to further the \r\nrealization of human rights so that all people are able to \r\nlive free and equal in dignity and rights; to strengthen \r\nthe United Nations counter-terrorism architecture and \r\nto protect the lives of the vulnerable and those most \r\nat risk of such mass violations; to strive for greater \r\nconsensus on disarmament and non-proliferation; and \r\nto work towards transforming the United Nations itself \r\nby addressing the need for gender equality and parity, \r\nbetter geographical balance, encouraging practices that \r\nare f lexible, innovative and coherent and making the \r\nOrganization more effective, efficient, accountable and \r\nfit for purpose.\r\nI take this opportunity to salute from this high \r\nrostrum the thousands of United Nations peacekeepers \r\nserving around the world, and to remember those who \r\nhave made the ultimate sacrifice in service to the high \r\nideals of this institution. Blessed are the peacemakers.\r\nAs President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session, I am fully committed to building \r\non the standards of transparency and inclusiveness \r\nset by my predecessor. That will be particularly so \r\nfor the process by which the new Secretary-General \r\nis appointed. Thereafter, our work will be to support \r\na smooth transition and a strong start for the next \r\nSecretary-General. I will ensure that there are ample \r\nopportunities for early interaction between the new \r\nSecretary-General and Member States so as to build a \r\nsolid working relationship with the Assembly.\r\nDuring the seventy-first session, I will also seek to \r\nimprove our ways of working in the General Assembly. \r\nI will look to address the effectiveness of Assembly \r\ncommittees to improve the coherence between the \r\nmajor organs, to enhance synergies and coherence of \r\nthe agenda in the light of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and to tackle long-standing issues that are \r\nholding back the efficiency and effectiveness of the \r\nOrganization and embed greater transparency and \r\nethics into all we do.\r\nOf course, one area in particular need of attention \r\nis Security Council reform. We must have a Security \r\nCouncil that is structured to be able to meet the new and \r\nemerging challenges of the twenty-first century. That \r\nincludes tackling the security dimensions resulting \r\nfrom climate change. During the seventy-first session, \r\nwe must work with each other across and between \r\ntraditional groups to build trust and f lexibility so that \r\nwe can achieve reform that is for the common good.\r\nIn conclusion, we have an expression in the Fijian \r\nlanguage that exhorts us to look ahead and not to dwell \r\non the grievances, the stalemates and the mistakes of \r\nthe past. Today, I have touched on some of the great \r\nchallenges that lie ahead for humankind. Let us prepare \r\nourselves for them. It has been said that a politician \r\nthinks of the next election but that a statesperson thinks \r\nof the next generation. Like never before, we must look \r\nto the statesmen and stateswomen among us to guide us \r\nto the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and to deliver the secure and harmonious \r\nfuture that all of us wish for our children, grandchildren \r\nand for those who come after them.\r\nBefore giving the f loor to the first speaker for this \r\nmorning, I would like to remind members that the list \r\nof speakers for the general debate has been established \r\non the agreed basis that statements should be no longer \r\nthan 15 minutes, to enable all the speakers to be heard \r\nat a given meeting. Within this time frame, I would like \r\nto appeal to speakers to deliver their statements at a \r\nreasonable pace so that interpretation in the six official \r\nUnited Nations languages may be provided properly.\r\nI would also like to draw the Assembly’s attention to \r\nthe decision taken by the General Assembly at previous \r\nsessions, namely, that the practice of expressing \r\ncongratulations inside the General Assembly Hall after \r\na speech has been delivered is strongly discouraged. \r\nIn that connection, after delivering their statements, \r\nspeakers are invited to exit the General Assembly Hall \r\nthrough Room GA-200, located behind the podium, \r\nbefore returning to their seats.\r\nMay I take it that the General Assembly agrees to \r\nproceed in the same manner during the general debate \r\nof the seventy-first session?\r\nIt was so decided.\r\nThe President: Finally, I should like to draw to the \r\nattention of members that during the general debate \r\nofficial photographs of all the speakers are taken by the \r\nDepartment of Public Information.

We are a country that is built \r\non and by the strength of diversity. We believe in the \r\npower of dialogue. We strongly advocate the principles \r\nthat govern the Organization — principles that are \r\nneeded now more than ever before. Today’s world \r\nshows signs of uncertainty and instability.\r\nThe international system is currently experiencing \r\nwhat could be described as an order deficit. Reality \r\nhas moved ahead faster than our collective ability to \r\naddress it. From outbreaks of regional conflicts to \r\nviolent fundamentalism, we face both old and new \r\nthreats that we have been unable to contain. In view \r\nof the refugee crisis and the upsurge in terrorism, we \r\ncannot help but be overwhelmed by a sentiment of \r\nperplexity or bewilderment. Hotbeds of tension show \r\nno signs of fading away. A state of virtual political \r\ninaction leads to prolonged wars with no solution. The \r\nsystem’s inability to react to conflicts further worsens \r\ncycles of destruction. The social vulnerability of so \r\nmany in several countries is exploited by narratives of \r\nfear and entrenchment.\r\nThere has been a return to xenophobia, and extreme \r\nforms of nationalism are gaining ground. Different \r\nexpressions of demagoguery bring about serious \r\nrisks on all continents. Even in the economic arena, \r\nthe fact is that today’s world lacks standards that can \r\notherwise reduce globalization’s asymmetries. Many \r\nhave yielded to the easy answer of protectionism. We \r\ncannot possibly shy away from such a world. On the \r\ncontrary, we must join hands and unite to transform it \r\nthrough diplomacy — balanced but firm diplomacy, \r\nsobering but determined. Such diplomacy should be \r\nwell-grounded and embracing of change. That is how \r\nBrazil has conducted diplomacy both within our region \r\nand beyond as a country that has pursued its interests \r\nwithout ever relinquishing its principles.\r\nWhat we wish for the world is what we wish for \r\nBrazil — peace, sustainable development and respect \r\nfor human rights. Those are the values and aspirations \r\nof our society. Those are the values and aspirations that \r\nguide us on the international stage. We would like to \r\nlive in a world in which law prevails over force. We \r\nwould like to have rules that reflect the pluralistic \r\nnature of the community of nations. We would like \r\nto have a results-oriented United Nations, capable of \r\nfacing up to the major challenges of our time. Our \r\ndebates and negotiations cannot possibly be confined \r\nto the Organization’s rooms and halls. Instead, they \r\nshould reverberate through the markets of Kabul, the \r\nstreets of Paris and the ruins of Aleppo.\r\nThe United Nations cannot be reduced to a mere \r\nobservation post that condemns the world’s scourges. \r\nInstead, the Organization should assert itself as a source \r\nof effective solutions. Those who sowed the seeds of \r\nconflict have reinvented themselves, but multilateral \r\ninstitutions have not. It is for that reason that Brazil has \r\nwarned that it is essential to make global governance \r\nstructures more representative, many of which have by \r\nnow aged and have become disconnected from reality. \r\nThe Security Council must be reformed. We stand \r\nready to overcome the current impasse surrounding \r\nthat issue.\r\nMany challenges go beyond national borders, \r\nincluding trafficking in drugs and weapons, and have \r\nan impact on our cities, schools and families. Fighting \r\norganized crime requires us to work hand in hand. \r\nThe very safety of our citizens ultimately depends on \r\nthe quality of our collective action. An example of \r\nthis is the war in Syria, which continues to engender \r\nunacceptable suffering, with women and children as \r\nthe main victims. A political solution can no longer be \r\npostponed. We call on the parties involved in the conflict \r\nto respect the agreements endorsed by the Security \r\nCouncil and to guarantee the civilian population access \r\nto humanitarian aid.\r\nWe are also concerned by the lack of prospects for \r\npeace between Israel and Palestine. Brazil continues to \r\nsupport a solution based on two States living in peaceful \r\ncoexistence within mutually agreed and internationally \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n8/56 16-29296\r\nrecognized borders. It is our common responsibility to \r\ngive new impetus to the negotiating process.\r\nAnother reason for concern, if I may say so, \r\nis the lack of progress on the nuclear disarmament \r\nagenda. There are thousands of nuclear weapons in \r\nthe world today. That amounts to thousands of threats \r\nto international peace and security. The most recent \r\nnuclear test in the Korean peninsula is a reminder of \r\nthe danger that nuclear proliferation poses. Brazil can \r\nspeak with the authority of a country where the use \r\nof nuclear energy exclusively for peaceful purposes \r\nis an obligation enshrined in the Constitution of the \r\nFederative Republic of Brazil.\r\nYet not all news is bad. There are well-known \r\nexamples, which have already been mentioned in today’s \r\nmeeting, of what can be accomplished through dialogue. \r\nWe celebrate that diplomacy has prevailed on the \r\nIranian nuclear dossier and encourage full compliance \r\nand understanding with the agreements reached. The \r\npeace accord between the Colombian government and \r\nthe Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia \r\nallows us to envisage the end of the last armed conflict \r\non our continent. I congratulate President Juan Manuel \r\nSantos and all Colombians for that achievement. Brazil \r\nstands ready to contribute to peace in Colombia. The \r\nre-establishment of diplomatic relations between Cuba \r\nand the United States of America shows that there are \r\nno eternal antagonisms or unbreakable deadlocks. We \r\nhope that closer ties will bring progress to the region \r\nas a whole, to include the economic and trade arenas. \r\nWe hope that the re–establishment of relations between \r\nCuba and the United State will be followed by the end \r\nof the economic embargo against Cuba.\r\nThis year, Brazil and Argentina celebrated the \r\ntwenty-fifth anniversary of the Brazilian-Argentine \r\nAgency for Accounting and Control of Nuclear \r\nMaterials. The Agency is the world’s only binational \r\norganization responsible for applying nuclear \r\nsafeguards. As Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has \r\nstated, the Agency is an inspiration for regional and \r\nglobal efforts towards the elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons. Confidence-building between Brazilians \r\nand Argentines in the nuclear arena, as I have just \r\nindicated, is part of the inception of our integration \r\nexperience, and of the foundation of projects like the \r\nSouthern Common Market. For Brazil, Latin American \r\nintegration is not only Government policy but the \r\nexpression of a constitutional principle and a permanent \r\nforeign policy priority.\r\nAs we are all aware, Governments of different \r\npolitical inclinations coexist in our region. That is \r\nnatural and sound. What is essential is that there be \r\nmutual respect and that we agree on basic common \r\nobjectives, such as economic growth, human rights, \r\nsocial progress, security and freedom for all citizens. \r\nThose are the objectives that guide and inform the \r\npresence of the United Nations in Haiti. Since 2004, \r\nBrazil has led the military component of the United \r\nNations Stabilization Mission in Haiti and has sent more \r\nthan 33,000 contingents to that Caribbean country. We \r\ntrust that the United Nations presence on the ground \r\nin Haiti will focus more on developing institutions and \r\ncapacity-building.\r\nBrazil’s neighbours also include our brothers \r\nand sisters from Africa, to whom we are tied by the \r\nAtlantic Ocean and by a long-standing history. This \r\nyear, we will host the Summit of the Community of \r\nPortuguese-speaking Countries. Of the Community’s \r\nnine members, six are African States. Brazil therefore \r\nlooks towards Africa with friendship and respect, with \r\na determination to undertake projects that will unite us \r\neven more.\r\nDevelopment is more than just an objective, it is \r\nan imperative. A developed society is one where all \r\nare entitled to high-quality public services such as \r\neducation, health care, transportation and security; one \r\nwhere equal opportunity is assured and where access \r\nto decent work opportunities is not a privilege for a \r\nfew. In a nutshell, development is paramount to dignity, \r\nand the dignity of humankind is one of the principles \r\nof the Brazilian State, as laid down in article 1 of the \r\nConstitution of the Federative Republic of Brazil.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nis the greatest United Nations endeavour in favour of \r\ndevelopment. Turning it into reality will require more \r\nthan the sum of national efforts. Supporting developing \r\ncountries will be crucial to the achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. Prosperity and well-\r\nbeing today should not impair the future of humankind. \r\nEconomic growth should be socially balanced and \r\nenvironmentally friendly. After all, we live on the same \r\nPlanet. There is no plan B. We must therefore take \r\nambitious measures under the principle of common \r\nbut differentiated responsibilities. Tomorrow, I will \r\nformally deposit Brazil’s instrument of ratification of \r\nthe Paris Agreement on climate change. As the world’s \r\nmost biodiverse country, and with one of the world’s \r\ncleanest energy mixes, Brazil is an environmental \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 9/56\r\npowerhouse with an uncompromising commitment to \r\nthe environment.\r\nDevelopment also depends on trade. In periods \r\nof economic crisis, protectionism often increases. It \r\nmust be curbed. Protectionism is a perverse barrier \r\nto development. It reduces the number of jobs and \r\nopportunities and makes men, women and families \r\naround the world, including in Brazil, fall victim to \r\nunemployment and hopelessness. The multilateral \r\ntrading system is part of the fight against that evil. Ending \r\nprotectionism in agriculture is particularly important \r\nfor development. We cannot keep backtracking on \r\nthe implementation of World Trade Organization \r\ncommitments on agriculture any longer. It is urgent \r\nto prevent sanitary and phytosanitary measures from \r\nserving protectionist purposes. It is urgent to discipline \r\nsubsidies and other distortive domestic support policies \r\nin the agricultural sector. Home to a modern, diversified \r\nand competitive agriculture, Brazil contributes to food \r\nsecurity. We produce for ourselves and we help to feed \r\nthe world.\r\nUnfortunately, the full enjoyment of human rights \r\nremains an unaccomplished aspiration in today’s \r\nworld. Every human being has the right to live freely, \r\naccording to one’s own beliefs and convictions. Such \r\nfundamental liberty, however, is disrespected every day. \r\nPersecutions, political detentions and other arbitrary \r\nacts remain recurrent in many areas of the world. Our \r\neyes should also turn to minorities and other more \r\nvulnerable segments of our society. That is what we \r\nhave done in Brazil through income-transfer initiatives \r\nand housing and education programmes, including \r\nfinancial aid available to students from poor families \r\nand backgrounds. We have also advocated gender \r\nequality as expressly envisaged in our Constitution. It \r\nis incumbent upon us to safeguard the rights of all.\r\nRefugees and migrants are, more often than not, \r\nvictims of human rights violations, poverty, war and \r\npolitical repression. Yesterday’s high-level meeting \r\ncast light on some of those substantive matters. Brazil \r\nis the product of immigrants, men and women from \r\nall continents. We repudiate all forms of racism, \r\nxenophobia and other forms of intolerance. We provide \r\nshelter to refugees and migrants, as I underscored in \r\nyesterday’s meeting (see A/71/PV.4B). \r\nIn a world still plagued by hatred and sectarianism, \r\nthe Rio de Janeiro Olympic and Paralympic games \r\nshowed that it was possible for nations to come together \r\nin an atmosphere of peace and harmony. In fact, for \r\nthe first time, a delegation of refugees was able to \r\ncompete in the games. Therefore, through sports, we \r\ncan succeed in promoting peace, fighting exclusion and \r\ntackling prejudice.\r\nFinally, I bring to the United Nations a message of \r\nuncompromising commitment to democracy. Brazil has \r\njust undergone a long and complex process, led by our \r\nnational congress and supreme court, which ultimately \r\nled to an impeachment. I must stress that everything \r\nunfolded in full compliance with constitutional order. \r\nWe offer that example as a clear indication that there can \r\nbe no democracy without the rule of law with standards \r\nthat apply equally to all, even the most powerful. That \r\nis what Brazil is showing the world through the process \r\nof cleansing its own political system.\r\nWe have an independent judiciary, an active public \r\nprosecutor’s office and executive and legislative bodies \r\nthat fulfil their duties. Individual agendas do not prevail \r\nbut rather the will of institutions, under the careful \r\noversight of a pluralistic society and a genuinely free \r\npress. Our task now consists in resuming economic \r\ngrowth and ensuring that Brazilian workers regain the \r\nmillions of lost jobs. We are clear on the path to be \r\nfollowed. It is the path of fiscal and social responsibility. \r\nTrust has already been restored and a more prosperous \r\nhorizon lies ahead in the near future. Our development \r\nprocess consists primarily of investment, trade, \r\nscience, and technology partnerships. In that regard, \r\nour relations with countries of all continents will prove \r\ndecisive.\r\nI do not wish to close my remarks without addressing \r\nthe Secretary-General, who will soon be leaving office. \r\nMr. Ban Ki-moon, as we all know, has devoted the \r\nlast 10 years of his life to a tireless pursuit of peace, \r\ndevelopment and human rights. He can be sure that we \r\nare highly appreciative and thankful for his efforts.\r\nIn the second decade of the twenty-first century, we \r\ncan no longer doubt that our problems are global. There \r\nis no place for isolationism. Ours is a common destiny. \r\nAt the United Nations, more than anywhere else, we \r\ncan come close to the universalist ideal that drives \r\nus all. About sixty years ago, my fellow countryman, \r\nOswaldo Aranha, stated from this rostrum that even in \r\na world as disturbed as it was then, no one wished to \r\nsee the doors of the United Nations close. He warned \r\nus all that without the United Nations, the shadows of \r\nwar would descend upon humankind to relentlessly \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n10/56 16-29296\r\nand indefinitely eclipse the hope of so many men and \r\nwomen. It is in the Assembly of nations that we nurture \r\nour hope, a hope achieved through dialogue, mutual \r\nunderstanding and respect for others, ourselves, our \r\nchildren and our grandchildren.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Federative Republic \r\nof Brazil for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Michel Temer, President of the Federative \r\nRepublic of Brazil, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chad\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Chad.\r\nMr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the Republic \r\nof Chad, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the \r\nRepublic of Chad, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Deby Itno (spoke in French): Allow me \r\nat the outset to congratulate His Excellency Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, Permanent Representative of Fiji, who has \r\nbeen elected President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session. We wish him every success in \r\ndischarging his mandate. Chad pledges its full support. \r\nI would also like to congratulate and thank His \r\nExcellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, outgoing President \r\nof the General Assembly, for his dedication and his \r\nmany initiatives to strengthen the role of the Assembly, \r\nthe most democratic and representative entity of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nAt the same time, on behalf of Chad and the \r\nAfrican Union, I would like to congratulate and render \r\na heartfelt tribute to His Excellency Secretary-General \r\nBan Ki-moon, whose mandate will soon come to a close. \r\nHis leadership, commitment and unflagging dedication \r\nduring the past 10 years have contributed to buttressing \r\nthe role of the United Nations and promoting its ideals.\r\nFounded over 70 years ago by 51 Member States, \r\nthe United Nations today now consists of 193 Member \r\nStates. The evolution of humankind has made our States \r\nincreasingly interdependent and interconnected, just \r\nas the challenges have become global and collective \r\nin nature. The world in which we live is facing \r\nmultidimensional threats which prompt great concern.\r\nArmed conflict, terrorism, climate change, \r\nmass migration, underdevelopment, poverty, and \r\npolitical, economic and financial crises have reached \r\nunprecedented proportions. No continent or region \r\nof the world has been spared by at least one of those \r\nscourges. Citizens of the world from all walks of life \r\nin some cases live in a perpetual state of fear and in \r\nothers in a state of despair because wars, indiscriminate \r\nviolence, poverty and the adverse effects of climate \r\nchange are on the rise and there is slim hope of solving \r\nthose problems.\r\nThe growing number of refugees and displaced \r\npersons throughout the world; the ongoing shipwrecks \r\nof makeshift boats in the Mediterranean, resulting in \r\nthe loss of thousands of lives; and the Syrian tragedy, \r\nwhich has been unfolding before our eyes for more than \r\nfive years, among other challenges, are tangible events \r\nthat eloquently illustrate our collective powerlessness.\r\nIn this world of uncertainty, Africa is the most \r\nvulnerable and exposed continent. The victim of \r\ncolonial plunder and affected by the numerous problems \r\ncaused by underdevelopment, Africa is today under \r\nfull attack from terrorism — the greatest threat of the \r\ncentury. Somalia, Libya, Mali, the Lake Chad basin and \r\nthe Sahel in general are seriously destabilized and the \r\ndanger is threatening to spread throughout the entire \r\ncontinent. Despite their modest means, the African \r\nUnion and its member States are highly mobilized and \r\ncommitted to fighting this absolute evil.\r\nThat is evidenced by the great sacrifices that the \r\nAfrican Union Mission in Somalia has made since \r\n2004, the implementation of the Multinational Joint \r\nTask Force by States of the Lake Chad basin and \r\nBenin to fight the Boko Haram terrorist group, and the \r\nestablishment of the Group of Five for the Sahel, which \r\nis a framework for security cooperation and countering \r\nall cross-border threats in the countries of the Sahel. \r\nThis impetus for mobilization should be strengthened \r\nand supported by the entire international community \r\nby all means available, including physical, financial \r\nand military, as well as through intelligence-sharing. \r\nIn that regard, from this rostrum I appeal to all States \r\nMembers of the United Nations, particularly Africa’s \r\npartners, to contribute to the African Fund Against \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 11/56\r\nTerrorism created by the African Union at its Summit, \r\nheld in Kigali in July.\r\nAfrica is also working with great diligence \r\nto manage the crises and conflicts besetting it by \r\npromoting a regional approach to crisis resolution, \r\nunderpinned by a peace and security architecture. Such \r\nan approach, which is deserving of the firm support \r\nof the international community, seeks to strengthen \r\nthe response capacity of regional and subregional \r\norganizations in the light of their geographical \r\nproximity, knowledge of the terrain and their rapid and \r\nf lexible deployment capabilities. The African Union \r\nMission in the Sudan, the African Union Mission in \r\nSomalia, the African-led International Support Mission \r\nin Mali and the African-led International Support \r\nMission in the Central African Republic are concrete \r\nexamples of the efforts of the African Union. \r\nThe complexity of conflicts throughout the world, \r\nincluding in Africa, is such that no organization can \r\nresolve them alone. That is why the African Union \r\nhas always advocated a strategic partnership with the \r\nUnited Nations to confront security challenges on the \r\ncontinent. The African Union has deployed all of the \r\naforementioned operations on behalf of the international \r\ncommunity and in deference to the purview of the \r\nSecurity Council. Consequently, the African Union can \r\nlegitimately count on the multifaceted and financial \r\nsupport of the United Nations.\r\nWe welcome the fact that this long-held position \r\nof the African Union is endorsed in the High-level \r\nIndependent Panel on United Nations Peace Operations \r\nin its 20l5 report (see A/70/95), which has been \r\nunanimously praised. Accordingly, in the spirit of \r\nshared responsibility, at its latest summit the African \r\nUnion adopted a measure to shoulder 25 per cent of \r\nthe cost of peacekeeping operations authorized by \r\nthe Security Council on the continent. The African \r\nUnion hopes to receive the remaining 75 per cent from \r\nthe United Nations peacekeeping budget, in keeping \r\nwith the spirit of the division of labour and cost-\r\nsharing. The African Union anxiously awaits the start \r\nof constructive discussions with the United Nations \r\non this proposal in order to reach an agreement that \r\ncould further strengthen the exemplary partnership \r\nbetween the African Union and the United Nations in \r\nthe interests of peace and the protection of civilians in \r\ntimes of crisis.\r\nThe political and security situation in many African \r\ncountries concerns us deeply. Mali remains a target \r\nof attacks by terrorist groups despite the presence of \r\nUnited Nations forces on the ground and the peace \r\nagreements reached following arduous negotiations in \r\nAlgiers. The international community must undertake \r\nan in-depth analysis of the situation with a view to \r\nending the conflict through dialogue, without losing \r\nsight of tailored and appropriate responses to the \r\nterrorist threat.\r\nThe situations in Libya and South Sudan remains \r\nextremely troubling and requires a more substantial \r\nmobilization on the part of the international community, \r\nwith the vigorous engagement and coordination of the \r\nrespective regional organizations involved in resolving \r\nthe crises. In that respect, the joint effort of the African \r\nUnion and the United Nations to deploy a civilian \r\nprotection force of 4,000 men, in addition to the United \r\nNations Mission in South Sudan, is to be commended. \r\nWe also call for more concerted efforts between the \r\nAfrican Union High-level Implementation Panel for \r\nthe Sudan and South Sudan and the United Nations to \r\npersuade the non-signatories of the Doha Document for \r\nPeace in Darfur to commit to it.\r\nDespite the successful holding of presidential and \r\nlegislative elections, the situation in the Central African \r\nRepublic remains fragile, as evidenced by the latest \r\nclashes between armed groups within the country. That \r\nsituation requires a long-term follow-up, and the newly \r\nelected Central African authorities must be further \r\nsupported in their efforts to normalize the situation in \r\ntheir country. I call on the international community to \r\nmaintain and strengthen its support for peacebuilding \r\nand national reconciliation there. We also urge the \r\npolitical actors in brotherly countries, including the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, Burundi and Gabon, \r\nto prioritize dialogue and cooperation with regard to \r\npre- and post-electoral crises. The African Union is \r\nready to assist them in settling their disputes through \r\npeaceful means.\r\nThe serious crises affecting Iraq, Syria and Yemen \r\ncall on our collective conscience concerning the \r\nmany who have been killed, wounded, displaced or \r\nmade refugees, as well as to the destruction of their \r\nvital infrastructure. The international community \r\nmust urgently find a political solution to all of these \r\ncrises through direct negotiations between the parties \r\nin conflict.\r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n12/56 16-29296\r\nConcerning the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, we \r\ncall for a definitive, just and equitable solution that \r\nguarantees security for Israel and an independent and \r\nviable State for Palestinians, urging both parties to \r\nresume dialogue and relaunch the peace process, and \r\nsetting out a clear framework for future negotiations, \r\nalong with a deadline, that will make it possible to put \r\nan end to the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory.\r\nAfrica is not only a gigantic reservoir of raw \r\nmaterials; it is also home to more than 1 billion men \r\nand women who yearn for harmonious development \r\naccompanied by social well-being and prosperity. The \r\ninternational community can eradicate poverty in the \r\nworld only if it upholds the commitments made within \r\nthe framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment (resolution 70/1), which puts people \r\nat the very core of all concerns. The implementation \r\nof the Agenda must be an absolute priority in order \r\nto eliminate extreme poverty, fight climate change, \r\nstrengthen resilience and promote sustainable economic \r\ngrowth that will benefit all.\r\nIn this respect, we stress the urgent need for an \r\neffective mobilization of the resources necessary to \r\nfinance development in accordance with the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda. Africa is committed to playing \r\nits part by ensuring an effective coordination of efforts \r\nas well as consistency among the goals of both Agenda \r\n2063 and Agenda 2030. No region of the world, no \r\nState can prosper alone or be surrounded by an ocean \r\nof destitution and poverty without experiencing the \r\nconsequences. \r\nThe successive waves of young African migrants \r\nmoving towards Europe that we see on a daily basis, \r\nthousands of whom have drowned, are a challenge to \r\nthe conscience of the international community. Though \r\nwe may erect barriers, build ghettos and mobilize naval \r\nforces to contain migrants, the phenomenon will not \r\nstop until the regions concerned are closely involved in \r\na suitable collective response. The solutions outlined at \r\nthe 2015 Valletta summit seem, unfortunately, to have \r\nfallen short of our expectations and of the challenges. \r\nIt is not a matter of providing charity to Africa, but, \r\nrather, of establishing with it a true strategic partnership \r\naimed at tackling common global challenges. It is not \r\ntoo late to begin collective and concerted action that \r\ntakes on board the legitimate concerns of all the parties \r\nconcerned.\r\nOne of the major challenges facing Africa is climate \r\nchange and environmental issues. The advance of the \r\ndesert, the silting up of the Niger river, the El Niño \r\nphenomenon in southern Africa and deforestation are \r\nall the most striking signs of climate change in Africa. \r\nLake Chad has shrunk from 25,000 square kilometres \r\nin 1960 to less than 2,000 today; this is additional \r\nproof of the degradation of our planet’s climate. This \r\necological disaster, which is endangering coexistence \r\namong communities and dangerously threatening food \r\nsecurity in the Sahel, will certainly have consequences \r\nfor the security and the stability of the region, as we \r\nsee from the strong presence and the accelerated \r\ndevelopment of the terrorist threat.\r\nThe partnership with Africa must also be seen \r\nin the fight for the preservation of the environment, \r\nwhich is seriously threatened. In this respect, the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, signed on 22 April \r\nby all States, creates new obligations and a structural \r\nframework for the long-term fight against climate \r\nchange. There is a great deal left to do to in order to \r\nachieve tangible achievements in the implementation \r\nof the commitments undertaken by all parties \r\naccording to the principle of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibility. \r\nThe Agreement will be credible only if it is \r\naccompanied by specific action aimed at bridging the \r\nenormous gap between the efforts that have been pledged \r\nand the noble objectives that are sought, including \r\nthose established at Copenhagen, namely, mobilizing \r\n$100 billion by 2024 for the poorest countries.\r\nThe question of United Nations reform, and \r\nspecifically that of the Security Council, remains a \r\nmajor concern for Africa, which, because of a historical \r\ninjustice, remains marginalized in this organ. It is \r\nunfortunate that such reform, which the African Union \r\nhas called for at every one of its summits for years, does \r\nnot seem to prompt any interest. Nonetheless, Africa \r\nwill continue to call for the creation of a more just and \r\nequitable universal Organization, while reaffirming its \r\nposition on this matter as expressed in the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus.\r\nConfidence and hope in the global solutions that \r\nthe United Nations inspires will be well founded only \r\nif all nations, in their diversity, take part in their design \r\nand implementation. All of us, as in a marriage, must be \r\nfaithful to humankind, for better and for worse.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 13/56\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Chad \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Idriss Deby Itno, President of the Republic of \r\nChad, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Barack Obama, President of the \r\nUnited States of America\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the United States of \r\nAmerica.\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Obama: As I address the General \r\nAssembly in this Hall as President for the final time, let \r\nme recount the progress that we have made these last eight \r\nyears. From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of \r\nour time, we coordinated our response to avoid further \r\ncatastrophe and return the global economy to growth. \r\nWe have taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened \r\nthe non-proliferation regime and resolved the Iranian \r\nnuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations \r\nwith Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America’s \r\nlongest war, and we welcome a democratically elected \r\nleader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance \r\nis helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, \r\npower communities across Africa and promote models \r\nof development rather than dependence. We have made \r\ninternational institutions such as the World Bank and \r\nthe International Monetary Fund more representative, \r\nwhile establishing a framework to protect our planet \r\nfrom the ravages of climate change.\r\nThis is important work. It has made a real difference \r\nin the lives of our people, and it could not have happened \r\nhad we not worked together. Yet around the globe we \r\nare seeing the same forces of global integration that \r\nhave made us interdependent also expose deep fault \r\nlines in the existing international order.  We see it in the \r\nheadlines every day. Around the world, refugees f low \r\nacross borders in f light from brutal conflict.  Financial \r\ndisruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and \r\nentire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle \r\nEast, basic security and basic order have broken down. \r\nWe see too many Governments muzzling journalists, \r\nquashing dissent and censoring the f low of information. \r\nTerrorist networks use social media to prey upon \r\nthe minds of our youth, endangering open societies \r\nand spurring anger against innocent immigrants and \r\nMuslims. Powerful nations contest the constraints \r\nplaced on them by international law.\r\nThis is the paradox that defines our world today. A \r\nquarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world \r\nis by many measures less violent and more prosperous \r\nthan ever before, and yet our societies are filled with \r\nuncertainty, unease and strife. Despite enormous \r\nprogress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing \r\nbecomes more difficult and tensions between nations \r\nbecome more quick to surface.\r\nI therefore believe that at this moment we all face \r\na choice. We can choose to press forward with a better \r\nmodel of cooperation and integration, or we can retreat \r\ninto a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, \r\nalong age-old lines of nation, tribe, race or religion. I \r\nwant to suggest today that we must go forward and not \r\nbackward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the \r\nprinciples of open markets, accountable governance, \r\ndemocracy, human rights and international law that we \r\nhave forged remain the firmest foundation for human \r\nprogress in this century. I make this argument not based \r\non theory or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too \r\noften we forget in the immediacy of current events. \r\nThis is the most important fact: the integration of \r\nour global economy has made life better for billions of \r\nmen, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the \r\nnumber of people living in extreme poverty has been \r\ncut from nearly 40 per cent of humanity to under 10 per \r\ncent. That is unprecedented, and it is not an abstraction. \r\nIt means children have enough to eat; mothers do not \r\ndie in childbirth.\r\nMeanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to \r\ncure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The \r\nInternet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge \r\nto a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-\r\nheld device. In medicine and manufacturing, in \r\neducation and communications, we are experiencing \r\na transformation of how human beings live on a scale \r\nthat recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. \r\nAs a result, a person born today is more likely to be \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n14/56 16-29296\r\nhealthy, live longer and have access to opportunity than \r\nat any time in human history.  Moreover, the collapse of \r\ncolonialism and communism has allowed more people \r\nthan ever before to live with the freedom to choose \r\ntheir leaders. Despite the real and troubling areas where \r\nfreedom appears to be in retreat, the fact remains that \r\nthe number of democracies around the world has nearly \r\ndoubled in the last 25 years. \r\nIn remote corners of the world, citizens are \r\ndemanding respect for the dignity of all people no \r\nmatter their gender, race, religion, disability or sexual \r\norientation, and those who deny others dignity are \r\nsubject to public reproach. An explosion of social \r\nmedia has given ordinary people more ways to express \r\nthemselves and has raised people’s expectations for \r\nthose of us in power. Indeed, our international order \r\nhas been so successful that we take it as a given that \r\ngreat Powers no longer fight world wars, that the end of \r\nthe Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon, \r\nthat the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by \r\npeaceful union and that China and India remain on a \r\npath of remarkable growth.\r\nI say all this not to whitewash the challenges we \r\nface or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that \r\nwe need to acknowledge these achievements in order to \r\nsummon the confidence to carry this progress forward \r\nand to make sure that we do not abandon those very \r\nthings that have delivered this progress. In order to \r\nmove forward, however, we do have to acknowledge \r\nthat the existing path to global integration requires \r\na course correction. All too often, those trumpeting \r\nthe benefits of globalization have ignored inequality \r\nwithin and among nations, have ignored the enduring \r\nappeal of ethnic and sectarian identities, and have left \r\ninternational institutions ill-equipped, underfunded and \r\nunderresourced for handling transnational challenges.\r\nAs these real problems have been neglected, \r\nalternative visions of the world have pressed forward \r\nboth in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: \r\nreligious fundamentalism, the politics of ethnicity \r\nor tribe or sect, aggressive nationalism, a crude \r\npopulism — sometimes from the far left, but more \r\noften from the far right — which seeks to restore what \r\nthey believe was a better, simpler age free of outside \r\ncontamination.\r\nWe cannot dismiss these visions. They are \r\npowerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too \r\nmany of our citizens. I do not believe those visions can \r\ndeliver security or prosperity over the long term, but \r\nI do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a \r\nvery basic level, our common humanity.  Moreover, I \r\nbelieve that the acceleration of travel, technology and \r\ntelecommunications — together with a global economy \r\nthat depends on a global supply chain — makes it \r\nultimately self-defeating for those who seek to reverse \r\nthis progress. Today, a nation ringed by walls would \r\nonly imprison itself.\r\nThe answer cannot be a simple rejection of global \r\nintegration. Instead, we must work together to make \r\nsure that the benefits of such integration are broadly \r\nshared and that the economic, political and cultural \r\ndisruptions that are caused by integration are squarely \r\naddressed. This is not the place for a detailed policy \r\nblueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas \r\nwhere I believe we must do better together.\r\nIt starts with making the global economy work better \r\nfor all people and not just for those at the top. While \r\nopen markets and capitalism have raised standards of \r\nliving around the globe, globalization, combined with \r\nrapid progress in technology, has also weakened the \r\nposition of workers and their ability to secure a decent \r\nwage. In advanced economies like my own, unions \r\nhave been undermined and many manufacturing jobs \r\nhave disappeared. Often, those who benefit most from \r\nglobalization have used their political power to further \r\nundermine the position of workers.\r\nIn developing countries, labour organizations have \r\noften been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class \r\nhas been held back by corruption and underinvestment. \r\nMercantilist policies pursued by Governments with \r\nexport-driven models threaten to undermine the \r\nconsensus that underpins global trade. Meanwhile, \r\nglobal capital is too often unaccountable — nearly \r\n$8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, the shadow \r\nbanking system that grows beyond the reach of effective \r\noversight.\r\n A world in which 1 per cent of humankind controls \r\nas much wealth as the other 99 per cent will never be \r\nstable. I understand that the gaps between rich and \r\npoor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today \r\ncan see the skyscraper  nearby, technology now allows \r\nany person with a smartphone to see how the most \r\nprivileged among us live and the contrast between their \r\nown lives and others’. Expectations rise then — faster \r\nthan Governments can deliver — and a pervasive sense \r\nof injustice undermines people’s faith in the system.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 15/56\r\nSo how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind \r\nimmigration any more than we can stuff technology \r\nback into a box. Nor can we look to failed models of \r\nthe past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market-\r\ndistorting subsidies, beggar-thy-neighbour policies and \r\noverreliance on natural resources instead of innovation, \r\nthese approaches will make us poor collectively, and \r\nthey are more likely to lead to conflict. The stark \r\ncontrast between, say, the success of the Republic of \r\nKorea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that the \r\ncentral planned control of the economy is a dead end.\r\nBut I do believe there is another path, one that \r\nfuels growth and innovation and offers the clearest \r\nroute to individual opportunity and national success. \r\nIt does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism \r\nthat benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that \r\neconomies are more successful when we close the gap \r\nbetween rich and poor and growth is broadly based. \r\nThat means respecting the rights of workers so that they \r\ncan organize into independent unions and earn a living \r\nwage. It means investing in our people, their skills, \r\ntheir education, their capacity to take an idea and turn \r\nit into a business. It means strengthening the safety net \r\nthat protects our people from hardship and allows them \r\nto take more risks to look for a new job or start a new \r\nventure.\r\nThese are the policies that I pursued here in \r\nthe United States and with clear results. American \r\nbusinesses have now created 15 million new jobs. After \r\nthe recession, the top 1 per cent of Americans were \r\ncapturing more than 90 per cent of income growth, but \r\ntoday that is down to roughly half. Last year, poverty \r\nin this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. \r\nWith further investment in infrastructure and early \r\nchildhood education and basic research, I am confident \r\nthat such progress will continue.\r\nSo just as I pursued these measures here at home, \r\nso the United States has worked with many nations to \r\ncurb the excesses of capitalism, not to punish wealth, \r\nbut to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it. That is \r\nwhy we have worked with other nations to create higher \r\nand clearer standards for banking and taxation, because \r\na society that asks less of oligarchs than of ordinary \r\ncitizens will rot from within. \r\nThat is why we have pushed for transparency and \r\ncooperation in rooting out corruption and tracking \r\nillicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when \r\nthey are fuelled by hard work and not the capacity to \r\nextort and bribe. That is why we have worked to reach \r\ntrade agreements that raise labour standards and raise \r\nenvironmental standards, as we have done with the \r\nTrans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more \r\nbroadly shared.\r\nJust as we benefit by combating inequality within \r\nour countries, so I believe advanced economies still \r\nneed to do more to close the gap between rich and poor \r\nnations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It \r\nis difficult to spend on foreign assistance, but I do not \r\nbelieve this is charity. For a small fraction of what we \r\nspent on the war in Iraq, we could support institutions \r\nso that fragile States do not collapse in the first place \r\nand invest in emerging economies that become markets \r\nfor our goods. It is not just the right thing to do; it is the \r\nsmart thing to do.\r\nThat is why we need to follow through on our efforts \r\nto combat climate change. If we do not act boldly, the \r\nbill that could come due will be mass migrations, cities \r\nsubmerged, nations displaced, food supplies decimated \r\nand conflicts borne of despair. The Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change gives us a framework to act, but only \r\nif we scale up our ambitions. There must be a sense of \r\nurgency about bringing the Agreement into force and \r\nhelping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of \r\nenergy.\r\nFor the wealthiest countries, therefore, a green \r\nclimate fund should be just the beginning. We need \r\nto invest in research and provide market incentives \r\nto develop new technologies and then make those \r\ntechnologies accessible and affordable for poor \r\ncountries. Only then can we continue lifting all people \r\nup from poverty without condemning our children to a \r\nplanet beyond their capacity to repair it.\r\nWe therefore need new models for the global \r\nmarketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. \r\nIn the same way, we need models of governance that \r\nare inclusive and accountable to ordinary people. I \r\nrecognize that not every country in this Hall is going to \r\nfollow the same model of governance. I do not think that \r\nAmerica can or should impose our system of government \r\non other countries, but there appears to be a growing \r\ncontest between authoritarianism and liberalism right \r\nnow. I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral \r\nin that contest. I believe in a liberal political order, an \r\norder built not just through elections and representative \r\ngovernment, but also through respect for human rights \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n16/56 16-29296\r\nand civil society and independent judiciaries and the \r\nrule of law.\r\nI know that some countries that now recognize \r\nthe power of free markets still reject the model of free \r\nsocieties. Perhaps those of us who have been promoting \r\ndemocracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end \r\nof the cold war, because we have learned that liberal \r\ndemocracy will not just wash across the globe in a single \r\nwave. It turns out that building accountable institutions \r\nis hard work, the work of generations. The gains are \r\noften fragile. Sometimes we take one step forward \r\nand then two steps back. In countries held together \r\nby borders drawn by colonial Powers, with ethnic \r\nenclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can \r\nsometimes appear to be a zero-sum game.\r\nSo, given the difficulty in forging true democracy \r\nin the face of these pressures, it is no surprise that some \r\nargue that the future favours the strong man, a top-down \r\nmodel, rather than strong democratic institutions. But I \r\nbelieve this thinking is wrong. I believe that the road of \r\ntrue democracy remains the better path. I believe that, \r\nin the twenty-first century, economies can only grow \r\nto a certain point until they need to open up, because \r\nentrepreneurs need to access information in order to \r\ninvent, young people need a global education in order \r\nto thrive, independent media needs to check the abuses \r\nof power. Without this evolution, the expectations of \r\npeople will ultimately not be met. Suppression and \r\nstagnation will set in. And history shows that strong \r\nmen are then left with two paths: permanent crackdown, \r\nwhich sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies \r\nabroad, which can lead to war.\r\nI will admit that my belief that Governments should \r\nserve the individual and not the other way around is \r\nshaped by America’s story. Our nation began with the \r\npromise of freedom that applied only to the few, but \r\nbecause of our democratic Constitution, because of our \r\nBill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people \r\nwere able to organize and march and protest. And \r\nultimately those ideals won out and opened doors for \r\nwomen, minorities and workers in ways that made our \r\neconomy more productive and turned our diversity into \r\na strength. It gave innovators the chance to transform \r\nevery area of human endeavour. It made it possible for \r\nsomeone like me to be elected President of the United \r\nStates.\r\nSo, yes, my views are shaped by the specific \r\nexperiences of America, but I do not think this story is \r\nunique to America. Look at the transformation that has \r\ntaken place in countries as different as Japan, Chile, \r\nIndonesia and Botswana. The countries that have \r\nsucceeded are ones in which people feel they have a \r\nstake. In Europe, the progress of those countries in the \r\nformer Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in \r\nclear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people \r\nof Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some \r\nplot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets \r\nbecause their leadership was for sale and they had no \r\nrecourse. They demanded change because they saw life \r\nget better for the people in the Baltics and in Poland, \r\nsocieties that were more liberal and democratic and \r\nopen than their own.\r\nSo those of us who believe in democracy need \r\nto speak out forcefully because both the facts and \r\nhistory, I believe, are on our side. That does not mean \r\nthat democracies are not without f laws. It does mean \r\nthat the cure for what ails our democracies is greater \r\nengagement by our citizens, not less. Yes, in America, \r\nthere is too much money in politics, too much entrenched \r\npartisanship, too little participation by citizens, in part \r\nbecause of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to \r\nvote.\r\nIn Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became \r\ntoo isolated from the normal push-and-pull of national \r\npolitics. Too often in capitals decision-makers have \r\nforgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic \r\nengagement from the bottom up, not governance by \r\nexperts from the top down. So these are real problems. \r\nAs leaders of democratic Governments make the case \r\nfor democracy abroad, we had better strive harder to set \r\na better example at home.\r\nMoreover, every country will organize its \r\nGovernment informed by centuries of history, the \r\ncircumstances of geography and the deeply held beliefs \r\nof its people. So I recognize that a traditional society may \r\nvalue unity and cohesion more than a diverse country \r\nlike my own, which was founded upon what at the time \r\nwas a radical idea, the idea of the liberty of individual \r\nhuman beings endowed with certain God-given rights. \r\nBut that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia \r\nor Africa or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary \r\nrule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can \r\nshape their lives. I believe that spirit is universal. If \r\nanyone doubts the universality of that desire, listen to \r\nthe voices of young people everywhere who call out \r\nfor freedom and dignity and the opportunity to control \r\ntheir own lives.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 17/56\r\nThis leads me to the third thing we need to do. We \r\nmust reject any forms of fundamentalism or racism or \r\nbelief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional \r\nidentities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead, \r\nwe need to embrace the tolerance that results from \r\nrespect for all human beings. It is a truism that global \r\nintegration has led to a collision of cultures. Trade, \r\nmigration, the Internet — all these things can challenge \r\nand unsettle our most cherished identities. We see \r\nliberal societies express opposition when women \r\nchoose to cover themselves. We see protests responding \r\nto Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the \r\nProphet Mohammed.\r\nIn a world that left the age of empire behind, we see \r\nRussia attempting to recover lost glory through force. \r\nAsian powers debate competing claims of history. \r\nAnd in Europe and the United States, we see people \r\nwrestle with concerns about immigration and changing \r\ndemographics, suggesting that somehow people who \r\nlook different are corrupting the character of our \r\ncountries. There is no easy answer for resolving all \r\nthese social forces, and we must respect the meaning \r\nthat people draw from their own traditions, from their \r\nreligion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of \r\nnationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible \r\nif our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an \r\nimpulse to dehumanize or dominate another group.\r\nIf our religion leads us to persecute those of \r\nanother faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if \r\nour traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to \r\nschool, if we discriminate on the basis of race, tribe \r\nor ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will \r\nfray. The world is too small. We are too packed together \r\nfor us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking. \r\nWe see this mindset in too many parts of the \r\nMiddle East. So much of the collapse in order there \r\nhas been fuelled because leaders sought legitimacy, not \r\nbecause of policies or programmes, but by resorting to \r\npersecuting political opposition, or demonizing other \r\nreligious sects, by narrowing the public space to the \r\nmosque, where in too many places perversions of a \r\ngreat faith were tolerated. And these forces built up for \r\nyears. They are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s \r\ntragic civil war and the mindless medieval menace of \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). The \r\nmindset of sectarianism, extremism, blood-letting \r\nand retribution that has been taking place will not be \r\nquickly reversed.\r\nIf we are honest, we will understand that no external \r\npower is going to be able to force different religious \r\ncommunities or ethnic communities to coexist for long. \r\nBut I do believe we have to be honest about the nature \r\nof these conflicts. Our international community must \r\ncontinue to work with those who seek to build rather than \r\nto destroy. And there is a military component to that, \r\nwhich means being united and relentless in destroying \r\nnetworks like ISIL, which show no respect for human \r\nlife. But it also means that in a place like Syria, where \r\nthere is no ultimate military victory to be won, we are \r\ngoing to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that \r\naims to stop the violence, deliver aid to those in need, \r\nand support those who pursue a political settlement and \r\ncan see those who are not like themselves as worthy of \r\ndignity and respect. \r\nAcross the region’s conflicts, we have to insist \r\nthat all parties recognize a common humanity and that \r\nnations end proxy wars that fuel disorder, because until \r\nbasic questions are answered about how communities \r\ncoexist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, \r\ncountless human beings will suffer — most of all in that \r\nregion — and extremism will continue to be exported \r\noverseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be \r\nable to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our \r\nown societies.\r\nAnd what is true in the Middle East is true for all \r\nof us. Surely religious traditions can be honoured and \r\nupheld while teaching young people science and math, \r\nrather than intolerance. Surely we can sustain our unique \r\ntraditions while giving women their full and rightful \r\nrole in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely \r\nwe can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing \r\nequal treatment for all communities — whether it is a \r\nreligious minority in Myanmar or an ethnic minority \r\nin Burundi or a racial minority right here in the United \r\nStates. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be \r\nbetter off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize \r\nthe legitimacy of Israel, and Israel recognizes that it \r\ncannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. \r\nWe all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, \r\nrather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads \r\nus to diminish others.\r\nAnd this leads me to the fourth and final thing \r\nwe need to do, and that is sustain our commitment \r\nto international cooperation rooted in the rights and \r\nresponsibilities of nations. As President of the United \r\nStates, I know that for most of human history, power \r\nhas not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n18/56 16-29296\r\nhave led too many to forget this truth. I have noticed \r\nas President that, at times, both America’s adversaries \r\nand some of our allies believe that all problems were \r\neither caused by Washington or could be solved by \r\nWashington, and perhaps too many in Washington \r\nbelieved that as well.\r\nBut I believe that America has been a rare super-\r\nPower in human history insofar as it has been willing \r\nto think beyond narrow self-interest, that while we have \r\nmade our share of mistakes over these last 25 years \r\n– and I have acknowledged some – we have strived, \r\nsometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions \r\nwith our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we \r\nhave been a force for good. \r\nWe have secured allies. We have acted to protect \r\nthe vulnerable. We have supported human rights and \r\nwelcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We have bound \r\nour power to international laws and institutions. When \r\nwe have made mistakes, we have tried to acknowledge \r\nthem. We have worked to roll back poverty, hunger and \r\ndisease beyond our borders, not just within our borders. \r\nI am proud of that. But I also know that we cannot \r\ndo this alone. And I believe that if we are to meet the \r\nchallenges of this century, we are all going to have to \r\ndo more to build up international capacity. We cannot \r\nescape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit \r\nto stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing \r\na world without them. When Iran agrees to accept \r\nconstraints on its nuclear programme, that enhances \r\nglobal security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with \r\nother nations. On the other hand, when North Korea \r\ntests a bomb that endangers all of us. And any country \r\nthat breaks this basic bargain must face consequences. \r\nAnd those nations with these weapons, like the United \r\nStates, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path \r\nof reducing our stockpiles and reaffirming basic norms, \r\nlike the commitment to never test them again.\r\nWe cannot combat a disease like zika that recognizes \r\nno borders – mosquitos do not respect walls – unless we \r\nmake permanent the same urgency that we brought to \r\nbear against Ebola – by strengthening our own systems \r\nof public health, by investing in cures, rolling back the \r\nroot causes of disease and helping poorer countries \r\ndevelop their public health infrastructures. \r\nWe can only eliminate extreme poverty if the \r\nSustainable Development Goals that we have set are \r\nmore than words on paper. Human ingenuity now gives \r\nus the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our \r\nchildren – including our girls – the education that is the \r\nfoundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to \r\nput our money where our mouths are.  And we can only \r\nrealize the promise of this institution’s founding – to \r\nreplace the ravages of war with cooperation – if powerful \r\nnations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I \r\nam criticized in my own country for professing a belief \r\nin international norms and multilateral institutions. But \r\nI am convinced that in the long run, giving up some \r\nfreedom of action – not giving up our ability to protect \r\nourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding \r\nourselves to international rules over the long term – \r\nenhances our security. And I think that is not true just \r\nfor us. \r\nIf Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its \r\nneighbours, it may be popular at home and it may fuel \r\nnationalist fervour for a time, but over time it is also \r\ngoing to diminish its stature and make its borders less \r\nsecure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of \r\ndisputes offered by law will mean far greater stability \r\nthan the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.\r\nWe are all stakeholders in this international system, \r\nand it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of \r\ninstitutions to which we belong. And the good news is \r\nthat many nations have shown what kind of progress is \r\npossible when we make those commitments. Consider \r\nwhat we have accomplished at the United Nations over \r\nthe past few years.  Together, we mobilized some 50,000 \r\nadditional troops for United Nations peacekeeping, \r\nmaking them nimble, better equipped, better prepared \r\nto deal with emergencies. Together we established an \r\nOpen Government Partnership so that, increasingly, \r\ntransparency empowers more and more people around \r\nthe globe. And together, now, we have to open our \r\nhearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate \r\nfor a home.\r\nWe should all welcome the pledges of increased \r\nassistance that have been made at this General Assembly \r\ngathering. I will be discussing that more this afternoon, \r\nbut we have to follow through, even when the politics are \r\nhard, because, in the eyes of innocent men and women \r\nand children who, through no fault of their own, have \r\nhad to f lee everything that they know, everything that \r\nthey love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves. \r\nWe have to imagine what it would be like for our \r\nfamily, for our children, if the unspeakable happened \r\nto us. And we should all understand that, ultimately, \r\nour world will be more secure if we are prepared to \r\nhelp those in need and the nations that are carrying the \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 19/56\r\nlargest burden with respect to accommodating these \r\nrefugees.\r\nThere are a lot of nations right now that are doing \r\nthe right thing, but many nations — particularly those \r\nblessed with wealth and the benefits of geography — that \r\ncan do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist \r\nthat refugees who come to our countries have to do \r\nmore to adapt to the customs and conventions of the \r\ncommunities that are now providing them a home.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that I recognize that \r\nhistory tells a different story than the one that I have \r\ntalked about here today. There is a much darker and \r\nmore cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human \r\nbeings are too often motivated by greed and by power. \r\nBig countries for most of history have pushed smaller \r\nones around. Tribes, ethnic groups and nation States \r\nhave very often found it most convenient to define \r\nthemselves by what they hate and not just those ideas \r\nthat bind them together. \r\nTime and again, human beings have believed that \r\nthey finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only \r\nto then repeat cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps \r\nthat is our fate. We have to remember that the choices \r\nof individual human beings led to repeated world \r\nwar, but we also have to remember that the choices of \r\nindividual human beings created the United Nations so \r\nthat a war like that would never happen again. Each of \r\nus as leaders and each nation can choose to reject those \r\nwho appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those \r\nwho appeal to our best, for we have shown that we can \r\nchoose a better history.\r\nSitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther \r\nKing, Jr., wrote: \r\n“Human progress never rolls on the wheels of \r\ninevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts \r\nof men willing to be co-workers with God.” \r\nAnd during the course of these eight years, as I have \r\ntravelled to many nations represented here, I have seen \r\nthat spirit in our young people, who are more educated \r\nand more tolerant, more inclusive, more diverse and \r\nmore creative than our generation; who are more \r\nempathetic and compassionate towards their fellow \r\nhuman beings than previous generations. And, yes, \r\nsome of that comes with the idealism of youth, but it \r\nalso comes with young people’s access to information \r\nabout other peoples and places — an understanding \r\nunique in human history that their future is bound with \r\nthe fates of other human beings on the other side of the \r\nworld.\r\nI think of the thousands of health-care workers \r\nfrom around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola. \r\nI remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now \r\nstarting new businesses in Cuba, or the parliamentarians \r\nwho used to be just a few years ago political prisoners \r\nin Myanmar. I think of the girls who have braved taunts \r\nor violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the \r\nuniversity students who started programmes online to \r\nreject the extremism of organizations like ISIL. I draw \r\nstrength from the young Americans — entrepreneurs, \r\nactivists, soldiers, new citizens — who are remaking \r\nour nation once again, and who are unconstrained by \r\nold habits and old conventions and unencumbered by \r\nwhat is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be.\r\nMy own family is made up of the f lesh and blood \r\nand traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of \r\ndifferent parts of the world — just as America has been \r\nbuilt by immigrants from every shore. And in my own \r\nlife in this country, and as President, I have learned \r\nthat our identities do not have to be defined by putting \r\nsomeone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting \r\nsomebody else up. They do not have to be defined in \r\nopposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and \r\nequality and justice and fairness. \r\nAnd the embrace of these principles as universal \r\ndoes not weaken my particular pride in or my particular \r\nlove for America — it strengthens it. My belief that \r\nthese ideals apply everywhere does not lessen my \r\ncommitment to helping those who look like me, or pray \r\nas I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag. But my faith \r\nin those principles does force me to expand my moral \r\nimagination and to recognize that I can best serve my \r\nown people and I can best look after my own daughters \r\nby making sure that my actions seek what is right for \r\nall people and all children, and other people’s daughters \r\nand sons. \r\nThis is what I believe — that all of us can be \r\nco-workers with God. And our leadership, and our \r\nGovernments, and the United Nations should reflect \r\nthis irreducible truth.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the United States of \r\nAmerica for the statement he has just made. \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n20/56 16-29296\r\nMr. Barack Obama, President of the United \r\nStates of America, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nAddress by Mr. Andrej Kiska, President of the \r\nSlovak Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Slovak Republic.\r\nMr. Andrej Kiska, President of the Slovak Republic, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall. \r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Andrej Kiska, President of the Slovak \r\nRepublic, and to invite him to address the Assembly. \r\nPresident Kiska: Many world leaders care more \r\nabout retaining power than improving the lives of \r\ntheir people. Those words of Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon were recently addressed to us, the people \r\nin this Hall. We who are joined here are incredibly \r\nprivileged. Our job enables us to be in touch with the \r\nmost successful and the most miserable. We can meet \r\nindividuals with remarkable destinies and also the poor \r\nwhose daily routine is to fight for a piece of bread or a \r\nbottle of clean water to stay alive. Each of them trusts \r\nthat we will be able to understand the scope of their \r\nproblems. They hope that we will never set our personal \r\ninterests over the needs of our people, our countries and \r\nour planet.\r\nLast year’s decision of the international community \r\nto transform the world for good — to leave no one \r\nbehind — was a clear and ambitious way of how to \r\naddress these needs. We are also perfectly aware of \r\nthe nature of the challenges awaiting us to decarbonize \r\nthe economy, to promote inclusive and sustainable \r\ndevelopment. But too many people tend to be pessimistic \r\nwhen it comes to setting grand global goals. Seemingly, \r\nthere are more than enough reasons for their negativity, \r\nas we witness wars, terror and suffering. We see the \r\ndamaging consequences some of our actions have on \r\nthe planet and the people. And we can see them online, \r\nas new technologies bring us closer than ever to each \r\nother. \r\nIn the interconnected world of social networks, \r\nbad news travels especially fast. Sometimes it is \r\naccompanied by lies, propaganda and dangerous \r\nideologies aimed at manipulating the public, spreading \r\nhate and frustration, and creating a fearful picture of \r\nthe globalized world falling apart. Maybe that is one of \r\nthe reasons why so many people are sceptical about the \r\nglobal development goals and our ability to deliver, and \r\nwhy we often forget that humankind has an impressive \r\ntrack record when it comes to making the world a better \r\nplace. Global poverty has been halved in the past two \r\ndecades. People fight fewer wars and commit fewer \r\nhomicides. Many more men and women have access to \r\nhealth care and more girls attend schools than at any \r\ntime in the past.\r\nI am sure that we are more than capable of dealing \r\nwith such challenges as poverty, hunger, diseases, \r\ninjustice and discrimination. With the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, we have the best means in the \r\nhistory to make life on the planet as good as it gets. The \r\nsuccess of the new Agenda will not be possible without \r\nefficient international cooperation and coordination, \r\nbacked by United Nations institutions. Success will be \r\nnot possible without us, the people in this Hall. At the \r\nsame time, we should not forget about our very own \r\nhomework — to win the hearts, minds and trust of our \r\npeople. \r\nThe world has become smaller due to globalization \r\nand modern communication technologies. The \r\nproblems our world faces have become more global \r\nand intertwined. Yet our social instincts have often \r\nremained local, and our sense of responsibility is often \r\nlimited by our national borders. There is a real danger \r\nthat many of us thought we would not see spreading \r\nagain. It is the rise of nationalism, extremism, racism \r\nand intolerance in many parts of the world. I am certain \r\nthat responsible leaders need to address those dark \r\nmoods in our societies, because those moods are the \r\nultimate enemy of humankind — the enemy responsible \r\nfor the worst misery and bloodbath in our modern \r\nhistory.\r\nOne of our most obvious duties as political leaders \r\nis, without doubt, to provide for and preserve peace \r\nand development. We have established many useful \r\ninstitutions to progress in that effort. However, we are \r\nwitnessing the largest crisis of displacement since the \r\nSecond World War. There is no need for me to recall \r\nthe worrying number of refugees. We hear those \r\nnumbers so often that sometimes we forget that this \r\nis not a numbers game. As His Holiness Pope Francis \r\nreminds us, migrants and refugees are not pawns on the \r\nchessboard of humankind. They are children, fathers \r\nand mothers — real men and women.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 21/56\r\nEvery political misunderstanding and failure to \r\nfind solutions leads to more people without a roof over \r\ntheir head, more families separated and more hungry \r\nchildren. It means greater temptation to set people \r\nagainst each other and arouse fear among them. We may \r\nhave different starting positions, different experiences \r\nand even different points of view on the problem, but we \r\nall have to understand that refugees need our empathy \r\nand our help. I strongly and truly believe that it is a \r\nmoral duty of every successful, modern country to help. \r\nIt is a moral duty of any true political leader to think \r\nseriously about how to help those f leeing violence and \r\ndeath. Let us be honest here and again ask ourselves the \r\nquestion raised by the Secretary-General. Are we all \r\ndoing enough to improve the lives of people in need, or \r\nare we more concerned about retaining our power? Are \r\nwe here to serve or to be served?\r\nOur commitment to a just and safe world is tested \r\nas we mourn with the families of the victims of \r\nterrorism, and as we struggle to wrap our minds around \r\nthat source of human suffering. When a terrorist group \r\nenslaves, murders and takes hope from men, women \r\nand children, it is not a single nation’s problem. It is \r\nan attack on our very core — on our humanity. It is an \r\nattempt to kill goodness in us. Terrorists do not care \r\nabout dozens or hundreds of innocent victims. They \r\ntarget hundreds of millions of the hearts and minds of \r\nspectators around the world to cause them to fear and to \r\nhate, encourage hostility among nations and fulfil their \r\nsick vision of the clash of civilizations.\r\nWe need to stay strong in our societies and true to \r\nour core values and culture of mutual respect, peace \r\nand non-violence. We can see that it is not hard to \r\nmake people fear. Sadly, it is not hard to make people \r\nhate. But we must not respond by judging people by \r\nthe colour of their skin or their choice of worship. We \r\nneed to halt the growing anger, prejudice and hostility \r\ntowards different religions. True leadership brings \r\nhope, reinforces trust and offers sustainable solutions \r\nfor safety and peaceful coexistence.\r\nIn the words of a well-known catchphrase, we \r\nshould think globally and act locally. The crisis in \r\nUkraine — in the part of the world where I come \r\nfrom — has entered its third year. Slovakia is very \r\nconcerned about the destabilization of a neighbouring \r\ncountry and repeated violence in the region. I would \r\nlike once again to firmly call for tangible progress \r\nin reaching a settlement of the conflict. I believe the \r\nMinsk agreements remain the only viable way out of the \r\ncrisis. Slovakia is ready to continue to assist Ukraine in \r\nsecuring a stable, prosperous and democratic future for \r\nall of its citizens.\r\nNot long from now, the General Assembly will \r\nappoint a new Secretary-General of the United Nations. \r\nThis year, the process of selecting the next Secretary-\r\nGeneral has been more consultative, transparent and \r\nopen than ever before. My country has the extraordinary \r\nprivilege of being part of the process as we have fielded \r\nour own candidate. I wish to take this opportunity to \r\nexpress my gratitude and appreciation for the Member \r\nStates’ continued support as we approach the final \r\nstages of the selection process. Their support also \r\nproves that candidates from our region have a lot to \r\noffer in terms of potential, capabilities, knowledge and \r\naccomplishments.\r\nWe are still living in strange, contradictory times. \r\nWe can upload our personal medical data for an \r\nexamination by a physician on the opposite side of the \r\nglobe, and yet 16,000 children die every day, mostly \r\nfrom preventable or treatable causes. We are using \r\nautonomous, self-driving cars, but millions of kids still \r\ncannot find their way into a classroom. Our phones, \r\npowered by artificial intelligence, are speaking to us, \r\nbut one in 10 people on this planet does not have access \r\nto drinkable water.\r\nWith all our resources, all our innovative power and \r\nall our unprecedented ways of knowledge-sharing, we \r\ncannot ignore the opportunities that exist to increase \r\nglobal prosperity, freedom and the dignity of human \r\nbeings. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nhas been crafted on the basis of our successes and our \r\nexperience. It is our task to drive the necessary change \r\nto make the world a more prosperous, healthy, inclusive \r\nand safe place. It is our task to share the wealth of \r\nour planet.\r\nYes, times are uncertain, but I do believe that we can \r\nsucceed. As one of the Slovak priests who spent years \r\nin prison during the totalitarian period of my country’s \r\nhistory once said, “I do not know what the future will \r\nbring, but I know now how I will act.” He could say this \r\nbecause he was always guided by his values.\r\nWe can succeed too when we let our values guide \r\nus through difficult times — our values of humanity, \r\nsolidarity and empathy — and when we, the political \r\nleaders with the privilege and power of agenda-setting, \r\nwill not give up the battle for the hearts and minds of \r\nour people to remain open to humanity, solidarity and \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n22/56 16-29296\r\nhope, only then can our world prosper. Only then will \r\nwe truly leave no one behind.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Slovak Republic for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrej Kiska, President of the Slovak Republic, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. David Arthur Granger, President \r\nof the Republic of Guyana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Guyana.\r\nMr. David Arthur Granger, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. David Arthur Granger, President of \r\nthe Republic of Guyana, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Granger: The Co-operative Republic of \r\nGuyana congratulates you, Mr. Peter Thomson, on your \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-first session. The election of a representative of \r\nFiji, a small island developing State, to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at this session is especially gratifying. \r\nThe choice of theme for our general debate — “The \r\nSustainable Development Goals: a universal push to \r\ntransform our world” — is most appropriate.\r\nWe thank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, \r\noutgoing President of the General Assembly at its \r\nhistoric seventieth session, for his guidance of the \r\nAssembly over the past year.\r\nGuyana commends Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for his stellar stewardship of the United \r\nNations during his decennium. The international \r\ncommunity owes him an enormous debt of gratitude \r\nfor the earnest efforts he has indefatigably exerted to \r\nalleviate human distress, promote peace and sustain \r\ndevelopment around the world.\r\nThe Secretary-General’s courageous campaign to \r\ncombat the adverse effects of climate change and his \r\ncommitment to sustainable development have been \r\ntransformative. His labours bore fruit in the adoption \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nin September 2015, and in the signing of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, in April 2016.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement have \r\nhad a massive and undeniable impact on the manner \r\nin which the world manages the environment. The \r\n2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement are evidence \r\nof environmental common sense. They are excellent \r\nexamples of the sort of collective action most likely to \r\nensure a sustainable future and safety for the planet. \r\nThey are harbingers of hope for everyone, everywhere, \r\nforever. The Secretary-General’s leadership has \r\nirreversibly led the United Nations further along a \r\ngreen path. We thank him heartily.\r\nGuyana is part of this global green movement. \r\nOur natural assets, our commitment to sustainable \r\ndevelopment, our contribution to conquering the \r\nadverse effects of climate change and our collaboration \r\nwith the international community in seeking solutions \r\nto global threats have distinguished us an emergent \r\ngreen State. We are a State that will ensure a secure \r\nfuture for our people in the pursuit of a green economy. \r\nWe are a State that is proud of its place as a reliable and \r\ncooperative partner in international efforts to protect \r\nthe earth’s environment.\r\nGuyana recognizes the interlocking objectives \r\nof the Agenda and the Agreement. It realizes that \r\nthe establishment of a green State is consistent with \r\nbuilding climate resilience while mitigating the effects \r\nof climate change. Guyana promises to continue \r\nto work towards the Agenda’s goals, particularly \r\nby contributing to limiting increases in global \r\ntemperatures, and to work towards a green path of \r\ndevelopment that is in accord with the Agreement’s \r\nnationally determined commitments.\r\nGuyana serendipitously stands at the centre of \r\nthe Guiana Shield, one of the world’s last remaining \r\nspheres of virgin tropical rainforest. The Guiana Shield \r\nspans an area of 2.7 million square kilometres, an area \r\nlarger than Greenland, and it is shared by six South \r\nAmerican countries and territories — parts of Brazil \r\nand Colombia, all of Guyana, all of French Guiana, all \r\nof Suriname and part of Venezuela. Guyana, as a part \r\nof that Shield, is a net carbon sink. A green canopy of \r\nrainforest envelops more than 85 per cent of our land \r\nmass, the second highest percentage forest cover on \r\nearth. Guyana is pursuing a green path so as to better \r\nunderstand how to protect its precious biodiversity and \r\nsustainably manage its complex ecosystems.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 23/56\r\nGuyana made a covenant with the world to be an \r\nexemplar of green growth in 1989, three years before \r\nthe United Nations Conference on Environment and \r\nDevelopment, in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. We made a \r\ngift to the prospect of sustainable development and \r\nto the project of protecting our environment through \r\na generous grant of 371,000 hectares of our pristine \r\nforests, to be used as an international model for \r\nresearch, training and the development of technologies \r\nthat will promote the conservation and the sustainable \r\nand equitable use of tropical rainforests in a manner \r\nthat will lead to lasting ecological, economic and \r\nsocial benefits for the people of Guyana and the world \r\nin general. The Iwokrama International Centre for \r\nRainforest Conservation and Development, located \r\nin the centre of our country and at the heart of the \r\nGuiana Shield, survives and thrives as a testament to \r\nGuyana’s commitment to sustainable development and \r\nenvironmental conservation.\r\nGuyana is an important partner in the global \r\nenvironmental movement. It entered into an agreement \r\nwith the Kingdom of Norway to provide the world with \r\na relevant, replicable model of how the United Nations \r\nProgramme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation \r\nand Forest Degradation and the Role of Conservation, \r\nSustainable Management of Forests and Enhancement \r\nof Forest Carbon Stocks in Developing Countries \r\n(REDD-plus mechanism), the mechanism for reducing \r\nemissions from deforestation and forest degradation, \r\ncan align the development objectives of forest countries \r\nwith the world’s need to combat climate change. It has \r\nalso entered into agreements with the Kingdom of the \r\nNetherlands, the Federal Republic of Germany, Japan \r\nand other States, and international organizations.\r\nGuyana reaffirms its commitment to Goal 15 \r\nof the Agenda under which States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations pledge to protect, restore and promote \r\nsustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably \r\nmanage forests, combat desertification and halt and \r\nreverse land degradation and biodiversity loss. Guyana \r\nis improving the management of its ecosystems and \r\nnatural resources in order to conserve its forests and \r\ntheir rich biodiversity. We will fulfil our obligation under \r\nthe Intended Nationally Determined Contributions set \r\nforth in the Paris Agreement.\r\nGuyana will continue its research by establishing an \r\ninternational institute for biodiversity at the Iwokrama \r\nInternational Centre for Rainforest Conservation and \r\nDevelopment. That institute will allow scientists and \r\nstudents from the Caribbean and around the world to \r\ncome to our country to increase their knowledge of \r\nvital ecosystems and share in the study of the Guiana \r\nShield and its amazing biodiversity.\r\nGoal 13 of the Agenda calls for urgent action to \r\ncombat climate change and its impact. This goal \r\nenvisages and encourages international cooperation to \r\nreduce greenhouse-gas emissions and abate the adverse \r\nimpact of climate change. The Agreement obligates \r\nMember States to take action to limit the temperature \r\nincrease to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and foster \r\nclimate resilience and low greenhouse-gas emissions \r\ndevelopment in a manner that does not threaten \r\nfood production.\r\nGuyana is developing a comprehensive emissions-\r\nreduction programme as part of its responsibility to \r\ncontribute to global solutions in the face of the threat \r\nof climate change. We will set aside an additional \r\n2 million hectares of our territory for conservation \r\npurposes. Guyana is pursuing a low-carbon growth \r\ntrajectory to enhance its contribution to the campaign \r\nagainst climate change through the preservation of its \r\nforests, within the ambit of the REDD-plus mechanism. \r\nIt will contribute up to 48.7 million metric tonnes of \r\ncarbon-dioxide equivalents to the global mitigation \r\neffort, through an avoided-emissions programme.\r\nThe Agreement on climate change and the Agenda \r\nboth emphasize the importance of financial f lows in \r\nsupporting the efforts of States pursuing a green path \r\nto development, so that they can meet their adaptation \r\nand mitigation obligations and implement the Intended \r\nNationally Determined Contributions. I must state, \r\nhowever, that all our efforts — nationally, regionally \r\nand globally — for the advancement of development \r\nin an environment of peace and stability, are being \r\nchallenged by the territorial ambitions of our neighbour, \r\nthe Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.\r\nGuyana celebrated the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nits independence this year. Regrettably, Venezuela \r\nacknowledged this anniversary by reasserting, on \r\n26 May, our independence day, its repudiation of a \r\nborder treaty that it had solemnly signed 117 years ago \r\nand ratified and respected for over 60 of the years since \r\nthen.\r\nI addressed the Assembly last year and warned of the \r\ndanger that Venezuela posed to the peace and security \r\nof our region due not to its internal instability, but to its \r\nexternal assault on Guyana’s sovereignty and territorial \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n24/56 16-29296\r\nintegrity (see A/70/PV.16). I placed my hopes in the fact \r\nthat the process for the final resolution of Venezuela’s \r\nunworthy territorial claims rested now in the hands of \r\nthe Secretary-General of the United Nations. Since my \r\naddress last year, Venezuela has used every means to \r\nstall, as it has intensified its aggression against Guyana \r\nand thwarted all of the Secretary-General’s efforts to \r\npursue a way forward, at least in terms of a process that \r\nwould lead to a final resolution of the controversy.\r\nGuyana stands ready to have the International \r\nCourt of Justice reach a final determination on the \r\nmatter. We will work resolutely with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his final months of office, and with his \r\nsuccessor, to free Guyana from this surreal burden. \r\nIn the Geneva Agreement of 1966, Venezuela agreed \r\nthat the Secretary-General would determine the means \r\nof settlement of this controversy, including by judicial \r\nsettlement. Yet Venezuela defies his every effort to \r\nfulfil that commitment.\r\nThe United Nations cannot be a dispassionate party \r\nto a threat to peace anywhere and to a challenge to the \r\nlaw of nations. Venezuela’s territorial claim is such a \r\nchallenge. It strikes at the heart of the United Nations. \r\nIt strikes at the heart of the United States trusteeship \r\nof the law of nations. It strikes at the heart of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter, which the Secretary-General \r\nis sworn to uphold. Guyana, a small State, must look to \r\nthe United Nations for protection against threats to its \r\nsecurity, for intervention, for peace and for respect for \r\ninternational law.\r\nMy plea for international understanding of our \r\nplight has nothing to do with Venezuela’s internal \r\nsituation. The ordinary people of Venezuela are our \r\nsisters and brothers. Their pain touches our hearts, and \r\nwe wish them early relief from their agony. However, \r\nVenezuela’s claims are a threat to Guyana’s existence \r\nas an independent nation. They are a scandalous revival \r\nof the disease of the conquistadores that once plagued \r\nVenezuela’s own history. They are a crime against our \r\nhumanity, clothed in the verbiage of national honour.\r\nI also wish to iterate Guyana’s ongoing support, \r\nwithin the context of the preservation of sovereignty and \r\nits link with sustainable development, for the complete \r\nremoval of the commercial, economic and financial \r\nblockade imposed by the United States against another \r\nCaribbean country, the Republic of Cuba. We cannot \r\ncommit to policies that transform our economies with \r\na view to providing development for our peoples and \r\nnot demonstrate the political will necessary to change \r\nsystems that are in direct contradiction to those policies.\r\nGuyana is on a path to becoming a green State. \r\nHowever, its efforts — and those of other small \r\nStates — will be derailed unless there is collective \r\ncommitment by the greater part of the international \r\ncommunity to collaborate with those States determined \r\nto pursue a low-carbon, low-emissions path to \r\nsustainable development and to stopping the rise of \r\nglobal temperatures.\r\nThe road from Stockholm in 1972 to Paris in 2015 \r\nhas been long and difficult. However, the words of the \r\nDeclaration of the United Nations Conference on the \r\nHuman Environment remain as relevant in 2016 as they \r\nwere 44 years ago, in 1972:\r\n“A point has been reached in history when \r\nwe must shape our actions throughout the world \r\nwith a more prudent care for their environmental \r\nconsequences. Through ignorance or indifference \r\nwe can do massive and irreversible harm to the \r\nearthly environment on which our life and well-\r\nbeing depend. Conversely, through fuller knowledge \r\nand wiser action, we can achieve for ourselves and \r\nour posterity a better life in an environment more in \r\nkeeping with human needs and hopes... To defend \r\nand improve the human environment for present \r\nand future generations has become an imperative \r\ngoal for mankind ...” (A/CONF./48/14/Rev.1, para. \r\n6).\r\nThe General Assembly at the seventy-first session \r\nnow has the opportunity and the obligation to commit to \r\nmeasures to defend and improve the human environment \r\nfor present and future generations, thereby making the \r\nroad forward into the future an easier one for posterity. \r\nVenezuela’s aggression against Guyana should not be \r\nallowed to threaten our children’s future.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Guyana \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. David Arthur Granger, President of the \r\nRepublic of Guyana, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Highness Sheikh Tamim bin \r\nHamad Al-Thani, Amir of the State of Qatar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Amir of the State of Qatar.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 25/56\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nAmir of the State of Qatar, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Highness Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, \r\nAmir of the State of Qatar, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nSheikh Al-Thani (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, it gives me great pleasure to congratulate \r\nyou, Sir, on assuming the duties of the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session. I wish \r\nyou every success in fulfilling your tasks. I also wish \r\nto express our appreciation to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft \r\nfor his efforts during his presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventieth session. I also wish to \r\nextend our profound thanks to His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon for the efforts he has undertaken to achieve \r\nUnited Nations goals during his tenure.\r\nThe international community is facing many \r\nchallenges and unresolved regional and international \r\ncrises that have become a hindrance to regional and \r\ninternational development and stability. Some countries \r\ncontinue to pursue an approach with actions that go \r\nbeyond the framework of international legitimacy \r\nagainst the backdrop of international negligence in \r\nthe implementation of Security Council resolutions. It \r\nis no longer possible to overlook the weakness of the \r\nUnited Nations legal and institutional system and its \r\ninability in many cases to apply standards of justice and \r\nfairness in the functioning of its mechanisms. There is a \r\npersistent recurring pattern that marks all these crises: \r\nthe selectivity of the Security Council in addressing \r\nproblems, especially when it comes to the use of force \r\nby countries in international relations.\r\nAfter more than seven decades of Israeli occupation \r\nof Arab territories, the Palestinian cause is at standstill, \r\nwaiting for a just solution. The Government of Israel \r\nhas not only rejected the resolutions of international \r\nlegitimacy and the comprehensive Arab Peace \r\nInitiative, but it also seeks to impose a fait accompli \r\nthrough long-term plans to build settlements in the West \r\nBank and Jerusalem. It has founded its occupation on \r\ndiscrimination and racial segregation. It has established \r\ntwo legal systems under its sovereignty — one for \r\nthe occupiers and another for those languishing \r\nunder occupation.\r\nAgainst the backdrop of the world’s silence and the \r\nArab States’ involvement in their own current issues, \r\nIsrael’s leaders may believe that they have succeeded \r\nin their endeavour. However, they have utterly failed \r\nto resolve the issue. The Palestinian people are now \r\nmore devoted to their rights than ever. Furthermore, the \r\nArab peoples cannot accept any kind of normalization \r\nof relations with Israel as long as Israel proceeds with \r\nthe occupation and its related practices and before a just \r\nsolution to the Palestinian cause is achieved.\r\nBesides, what will Israel do with the millions of \r\nPalestinians who are living on their own land and are \r\nincreasing in number and resourcefulness? The options \r\nare clearly narrowing. Israel has either to opt for the \r\ntwo-State solution or to establish a system of apartheid. \r\nDoes Israel really think that it could maintain a system \r\nof apartheid in the twenty-first century? Eliminating the \r\noccupation has become an urgent political and security \r\nprerequisite and an international obligation towards \r\na people whose land was occupied and homeland \r\nconfiscated and whose suffering is exacerbating \r\nthe situation.\r\nThe Security Council bears a special responsibility \r\nto impose international legitimacy and consensus with \r\nrespect to the negotiations on the basis of a two-State \r\nsolution, including the establishment of a Palestinian \r\nState, with East Jerusalem as its capital, within the \r\npre-1967 borders. Meanwhile, it is necessary to \r\ncease settlement activities, respect the legal status of \r\nAl-Quds, lift the unjust siege on the Gaza Strip and end \r\nthe Israeli occupation of all occupied Arab territories, \r\nincluding the Syrian Golan.\r\nIn the past, from this very rostrum, we have warned \r\nthat inaction in addressing crises will only increase \r\ntheir intensity and complexity and consequently pose \r\na threat to international security. Today, more than five \r\nyears after the outbreak of the Syrian crisis and in the \r\naftermath of the destruction of most of Syria’s cities \r\nby the Al-Assad regime, we are meeting again in this \r\nHall. As a result of the crisis, the number of refugees \r\nhas doubled and the quest for refuge has become \r\ntranscontinental in scope. Syria is now importing \r\nterrorist and sectarian organizations and militias that \r\npose a regional and international threat.\r\nEveryone knows that the Syrian revolution started \r\nas a popular and peaceful uprising against a repressive \r\ndictatorial regime and that the great people of Syria \r\nface death or years of torture in prison if they attend \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n26/56 16-29296\r\npeaceful demonstrations against the regime. During \r\nthis period, the Syrian authorities have deliberately \r\ntried to turn the revolution into a violent one. It has \r\nalso acted under the guise of political rhetoric to split \r\nthe Syrian people into factions, but the people have \r\nresponded with the chant, “the Syrian people are one”. \r\nIn contrast, the regime’s declared slogan was “Al-Assad \r\nalone, or we will burn the country down”. Many people \r\nmay not have realized that this slogan is the de facto \r\nproject of the regime and remains its only programme.\r\nTheoretically, the majority of the countries of the \r\nworld have stood by the Syrian people, but in practical \r\nterms, Syria has been abandoned, supported only by \r\nsome loyal friends. Red lines had been set for the \r\nregime, but it violated them, and those who set the red \r\nlines did nothing. The red lines continued to shift until \r\nthe regime became aware that there were no limits on \r\nwhat it could do without accountability.\r\nIt is true that violent radical forces that have nothing \r\nto do with the objectives of the Syrian revolution have \r\nentered the Syrian arena, refuse to take up revolution’s \r\nbanner and fight against the rebels more than against \r\nthe regime. There have been many violations, but these \r\nphenomena, which have marred the revolution, cannot \r\nbe understood without also considering the barbaric \r\npolicy of repression applied by the Syrian regime and \r\nthe inability of the international community to protect \r\ncivilians against the use of chemical weapons, bomb \r\nbarrels and torture.\r\nThe city of Daraa presented a model of peaceful \r\nrevolution, exemplified at the beginning by the tossing \r\nof f lowers at soldiers, but after massacres claiming the \r\nlives of hundreds of innocent people, mostly women \r\nand children, the city was forced, like other cities, to \r\ndefend itself more forcefully. Since then, Daraa has \r\nbeen reeling under non-stop shelling and a starvation \r\nsiege, despite the fact that it was never controlled by any \r\nradical or takfiri organization, and its revolutionaries \r\nhave not committed any violations.\r\nWhy then are the inhabitants of Daraa being \r\ndisplaced while the international community does \r\nnothing? Why was no warning issued before the regime \r\nbegan its shelling and depopulation efforts, when \r\nwarnings have been issued elsewhere, for example, prior \r\nto the recent bombing against forces in Al-Hasakah \r\nprovince? We consider the latter warning to have been \r\nan appropriate one, but no analogous action was taken \r\nwith respect to Daraa, Muadamiyat Al-Sham, Madaya, \r\nAl-Zabadani or other towns also threatened with \r\ndisplacement. Many Syrian citizens are wondering the \r\nsame thing.\r\nWe cannot fool ourselves or our people because \r\nit is unacceptable that the will of the international \r\ncommunity is crippled when it comes to the perpetrators \r\nof crimes against humanity. It is simply not true that \r\nit was impossible to protect the Syrian people. The \r\ninternational community has allowed illegal military \r\ninterventions to be undertaken to overthrow regimes \r\nin our region, which is still taking its toll on us. \r\nUnfortunately, while many of us share responsibility \r\nfor that situation, the international community has not \r\nstepped in to protect a defenceless people, despite the \r\nfact that this people has proved time and again that it \r\ncould change the regime on its own if they were protected \r\nby the international community from bombardment.\r\nPutting an end to this humanitarian disaster has \r\nbecome a political and moral necessity. The Security \r\nCouncil has a historical and undeniable responsibility \r\nto stop the bloodshed of the Syrians by halting \r\nthe barbaric bombings and blockades of cities, by \r\nrepatriating the displaced and by taking measures to \r\nresume the political process within the framework of \r\nresolution 2254 (2015) and decisions based on the first \r\nGeneva Convention, which call for the formation of a \r\ntransitional ruling body with full powers to meet the \r\naspirations of the Syrian people and maintain the unity \r\nand sovereignty of Syria, on the basis of equal rights \r\nfor all citizens of Syria, without discrimination on the \r\nbasis of faith, creed, ethnicity or race.\r\nThe Gulf region has strategic importance at both \r\nregional and global levels. This region is undergoing \r\nseveral crises that vary widely in character but are \r\nsimilar at the core. Constructive dialogue must be \r\nundertaken if solutions to them are to be found. To \r\nachieve the desired result, dialogue between countries \r\nmust be based on the principles of good-neighbourliness, \r\nmutual respect and non-interference in the affairs of \r\nothers. The success of dialogue among parties within a \r\nState, as we have seen in Iraq, requires giving priority \r\nto political and social consensus and strengthening the \r\nconcept of full and equal citizenship before the law, \r\nleaving aside all forms of sectarianism.\r\nWith respect to Yemen, the State of Qatar renews \r\nits support for the return of legitimacy as the only \r\nway to ensure its security, unity and stability. There \r\nis no doubt that the negligence of the international \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 27/56\r\ncommunity in implementing resolutions of the Security \r\nCouncil, especially resolution 2216 (2015), has given \r\nsome political forces in Yemen the opportunity to carry \r\nout coup-related actions that have hampered reaching \r\nthe desired political solution that would satisfy the \r\nYemeni people’s yearning for unity and stability.\r\nI take this opportunity to express our appreciation \r\nfor the efforts of my brother, His Highness Sheikh \r\nSabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State \r\nof Kuwait, who has sponsored the Yemeni negotiations \r\nhosted by his country. We will continue to support \r\nthe Secretary-General’s Special Envoy for Yemen as \r\nwell as the international efforts undertaken to resume \r\npolitical consultations among Yemeni parties in order \r\nto reach a political settlement, in accordance with the \r\nGulf Cooperation Council Initiative, the outcomes of \r\nthe National Dialogue Conference and resolution 2216 \r\n(2015).\r\nAlthough the situation in Libya is still turbulent, \r\nwe look forward to restoring stability through the \r\nefforts of the Presidential Council and the present \r\nGovernment backed by the international community. \r\nWe also look forward to confronting terrorism and \r\ntackling its serious effects. The State of Qatar has \r\ncontributed to the success of the international political \r\nsolution. We reaffirm our support for all efforts aimed \r\nat strengthening the Libyan national accord and warn \r\nthat instability could deal a glancing blow to what has \r\nbeen achieved heretofore and undermine United Nations \r\nefforts aimed at promoting national reconciliation and \r\nled by the Security Council.\r\nWe are surprised to note that some countries support \r\nforces in Libya that have rejected the international \r\nsolution and are acting to thwart resolution 1970 (2011) \r\nby force, despite the fact that the resolution provides \r\nfor imposing sanctions on such forces. Certain forces \r\nhave placed themselves under the authority of the \r\nPresidential Council and are engaged in combating \r\nterrorism, but others have rejected the international \r\nsolution and sought to exploit the volatile situation by \r\noccupying oil-export terminals while the world looks \r\non, silent. Is this a proper way to encourage Libyans to \r\nfight terrorism?\r\nThe terrorism we are facing is a threat to \r\nour peoples, countries and economic and social \r\nachievements, thereby requiring that we intensify our \r\nefforts to combat it. All of us are mindful that success \r\nin countering this dangerous phenomenon is not easily \r\nreached, but it is not impossible either, especially when \r\nthere is the political will to address the social roots of \r\nthis abhorrent phenomenon. We need to understand the \r\ncircumstances that, in an atmosphere of desperation and \r\ndeadlocked perspectives, give rise to radical ideologies.\r\nWe need to protect the young people who are \r\ntargeted by extremist groups. Fighting terrorism is not \r\nconfined to the security dimension; rather, we need to \r\ngo a step further and promote the values of tolerance, \r\nculture, plurality and dialogue, while taking into \r\naccount the right of people to resist occupation, which \r\nis a right that has been enshrined in international laws, \r\ncovenants and norms.\r\nTo restore our credibility, we must carefully define \r\nterrorism and diligently stand against it, if we are to \r\neducate our young people and mobilize our communities \r\nagainst this scourge. The definition we choose should \r\nnot vary according to the identity of the perpetrator or \r\nthe victim or because of a particular political interest. \r\nWe have seen cases, for example, where a certain \r\norganization, misbranded as terrorist when it was \r\nsimply a political adversary, was later embraced as a \r\nfriend when it became a temporary ally.\r\nDistinctions should not be made about the lives of \r\ncivilians, whether they be from Istanbul, Gaza, New \r\nYork or Aleppo. No life is more important or valuable \r\nthan any other life. The double standards used to address \r\nthis phenomenon, by linking terrorism to a certain faith \r\nor culture or by absolving Governments that engage in \r\nit from being described as terrorist, complicates efforts \r\nto uproot the phenomenon and reinforces pretexts being \r\nused by terrorists to justify their actions. In this context, \r\nand as a natural consequence of our policy of rejecting \r\nradicalism and terrorism based on our values and \r\nculture and the teachings of the true Islamic religion, \r\nwe reiterate our support for the efforts to eradicate the \r\nphenomenon of terrorism that are undertaken within \r\nthe framework of international legitimacy.\r\nRespect for and the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights constitute one of the basic pillars of the \r\nUnited Nations Charter’s stated purposes and principles \r\nand are consistent with the Arab and Islamic principles \r\nand values that treasure humankind and honour it as a \r\ncreation of almighty God. The State of Qatar is eager \r\nto implement its obligations at both the national and \r\ninternational levels to defend collective and individual \r\nrights of people and promote human rights around \r\nthe world.\r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n28/56 16-29296\r\nAccordingly, one of the most important challenges \r\nwe must act upon today is that of protecting refugees. \r\nThis challenge requires cooperation and joint action \r\nin order to uproot the causes of forced displacement. \r\nWe must urgently provide aid and assistance as a \r\nhumanitarian duty incumbent upon us all. Qatar’s \r\ndevelopment and relief contribution has reached more \r\nthan 100 countries worldwide, and we continue to \r\ncoordinate with Governmental and non-governmental \r\nagencies to provide even more development and relief \r\naid.\r\nQatar supports over 10 million children around the \r\nworld and promotes the potential of some 1.2 million \r\nArab young people, so as to empower them to be active \r\nand productive in their communities. Over the past five \r\nyears since 2011, the value of the economic assistance \r\nprovided by the State of Qatar has increased threefold \r\nto reach 13 billion Qatari riyals.\r\nThe State of Qatar will continue to be a venue for \r\ndialogue and conflict resolution by peaceful means. \r\nIt will also remain committed to international action, \r\ncooperation and partnership within the framework of \r\nthe efforts of the international community to counter \r\nshared humanitarian challenges.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Amir of the State of Qatar for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nSheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani, Amir of the \r\nState of Qatar, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nMr. El Haycen (Mauritania), Vice–President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAddress by Mr. Mauricio Macri, President of the \r\nArgentine Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Argentine Republic.\r\n Mr. Mauricio Macri, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Mauricio \r\nMacri, President of the Argentine Republic, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Macri (spoke in Spanish): It is an honour \r\nto be here today for the first time to represent the \r\nArgentine Republic before the General Assembly.\r\nWe are living in a time of great global transformation, \r\nwhere changes take place at an increasingly rapid pace \r\nand provide us with new opportunities. In the twenty-\r\nfirst century we are faced with a continuous challenge, \r\nnamely, that of adapting to the new realities of global \r\ninterdependency. Building a modern international order \r\nis an ongoing task in which we are all protagonists.\r\nThe principles of the Organization guide us to \r\nencourage dialogue and cooperation between our \r\ncountries in order to achieve development, peace and \r\ninternational security. In the first 71 years of the United \r\nNations, important advances have been made. However, \r\nthere is still much to be done. The United Nations has \r\nproposed a horizon towards which we should advance. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a \r\ngoal that we should approach collectively.\r\nI am proud to represent a country that has \r\ncontributed to the international legal framework, \r\ndriving advances in human rights, humanitarian rights \r\nand the peaceful settlement of conflicts. With the \r\nSustainable Development Goals in mind, it makes us \r\nproud that our Governmental priorities are in line with \r\nthose of the international community. In Argentina, we \r\nhave set ourselves three main objectives.\r\nOur first goal is to move towards zero poverty. That \r\nmeans becoming a country with equal opportunities, \r\nwhere our children can shape their future and where \r\nevery Argentinian is able to develop his or her potential. \r\nA country like ours, which is a food–producing \r\npowerhouse, cannot accept the fact that there are people \r\ngoing hungry anywhere the world.\r\nOur second goal is to defeat drug trafficking. The \r\nworld drug problem, addiction and violence associated \r\nwith organized crime requires that we work together \r\ntowards a comprehensive agenda, based on human \r\nrights and focused on both supply and demand.\r\nOur third goal is to unite Argentinians through \r\ndialogue, respect for the rule of law and the \r\nstrengthening of democracy. For in the twenty-first \r\ncentury, the quality of political leadership is measured \r\nby the ability to build bridges and create trust. These \r\nare elements that every society needs to properly \r\nfunction. Argentinians have chosen that path, namely, \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 29/56\r\nthat of trusting one another, engaging in dialogue and \r\nspeaking honestly to each other.\r\nAn important step in this direction was working \r\non the problems of the past in order to be able to \r\nlook towards the future. We have rebalanced the \r\nmacroeconomy and began to strengthen relations \r\nwith our neighbouring countries. We are establishing \r\nmature links with other countries and multilateral \r\norganizations, and we are already starting to see results. \r\nWe have returned to international credit markets, and \r\nmany companies have demonstrated that they trust \r\nArgentina. New investments are announced every day, \r\nwhich will lead to jobs and put the country on track \r\nto expand its economy. Argentines are ready to enter \r\ninto the twenty-first century and assume our role in the \r\ninternational community.\r\nHowever, we cannot achieve any of those goals \r\nalone. We have to work together, starting with our \r\nneighbours. I am from a region that thinks of itself as \r\na common neighbourhood with shared challenges. In \r\nrecent years, Latin America has made huge efforts to \r\nreduce poverty, thanks to robust social policies and to \r\nthe very favourable international economic conditions. \r\nBut today the context is different. All of our countries \r\nhave experienced diminished growth, while global trade \r\nhas shown weak performance. At the regional level, \r\nthe balance of trade is less favourable and inflation \r\npunishes those who have less.\r\nBut we in Argentina are optimistic. We know \r\nthat, in order to grow inclusively, Latin America must \r\ncount on a tremendous amount of human talent as well \r\nas incomparable natural wealth. While in the world \r\nthere are trends that generate worry and uncertainty, \r\nencouraging news is coming from our region, such \r\nas the normalization of relations between Cuba and \r\nthe United States and the peacebuilding process in \r\nColombia. In addition, we see conditions for creating a \r\ncorridor of peace from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific \r\nOcean throughout the region, which will contribute to \r\nregional stability and prosperity.\r\nBut the challenges of global governance in the \r\ntwenty-first century do not exclusively belong to some \r\ncountries or regions; they concern everyone. We must \r\ncooperate, while thinking globally and acting locally \r\nand without losing sight of the first principle of this \r\nOrganization, which is based on the sovereign equality \r\nof all of its Members. A world with more voices is a \r\nmore just world. That is why it is important that we \r\ncontinue building a system based on clear rules that \r\nreflect diversity and plurality and that facilitate \r\nconsensus.\r\nClimate change is the greatest, most important \r\nchallenge that humankind faces. Only if we are aware \r\nof that fact will we be able to make progress without \r\njeopardizing our future and the future of future \r\ngenerations. We in Argentina are betting ambitiously \r\non renewable energy to develop our potential in areas \r\nsuch as solar, wind and biomass energy generation. We \r\nsigned the Paris Agreement and we are proud of being \r\none of the first countries to complete the ratification \r\nprocess. That is why we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to put forth its greatest efforts so that we \r\ncan soon see the Agreement enter into force, which is \r\nso important for our future.\r\nAnother major challenge is the problem of \r\nrefugees. Although a year ago we made a commitment \r\nto leave nobody behind, the images we see today hurt \r\nand worry us. This reality calls for us to do more. \r\nOur White Helmets are widely recognized for their \r\ncommitment to humanitarian matters, which is why, \r\nlast May, Argentina was present in the Syrian conflict \r\nzone to offer assistance at a refugee camp in Lebanon. I \r\nwould like to announce that we are going to accept even \r\nmore refugees from Syria and from its neighbouring \r\ncountries, favouring families with children. We have \r\nestablished a national cabinet of ministers charged with \r\nbroadening the existing humanitarian programme, \r\nwhich coordinates ministries and Governmental \r\ndepartments and addresses security measures and full \r\nsocial integration. We will be able to gradually increase \r\nour ability to receive more people to the extent that \r\nfinancial support, technical assistance and international \r\nlogistical support allow us to do.\r\nGender equality is also a primary goal of ours, \r\nupon which we have to work with conviction and \r\npolitical determination. Argentina is making the full \r\nempowerment of women its State policy. We have \r\nestablished a national action plan for prevention and \r\nassistance for women at risk in order to put an end \r\nto violence against women in all of its forms. We are \r\nworking with a cross-cutting approach so that women \r\nwill have the same social, political, economic and \r\ncultural opportunities in the country as men. In this \r\nregard, we are grateful for the support that Susana \r\nMalcorra, our Minister for Foreign Affairs, has received \r\nas a candidate to be the next Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations. In the twenty-first century, having a \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n30/56 16-29296\r\nwoman as the head of the Organization would be a very \r\nencouraging example.\r\nWhen the Organization was founded, countries \r\nassumed the commitment of maintaining international \r\npeace and security. However, we live in a world that \r\nis increasingly violent, where radical extremism \r\nthreatens innocent people and vulnerable populations. \r\nIt should be remembered that, in 1992 and in 1994, \r\nArgentina was a victim of international terrorism, \r\nwith two attacks, for which we hope to receive greater \r\ninternational cooperation in clarifying events and \r\npunishing those responsible. My country condemns any \r\ngroup that through its actions aims to promote terror in \r\nany part of the planet.\r\nIn recent years, this phenomenon has worsened. To \r\nstop it, international cooperation is indispensable. We \r\nhave to promote development both inside and outside \r\nof our countries because development does not stop \r\nat the border. Growth with inclusion, dialogue and \r\ntolerance — and the creation of opportunities — all \r\nhelp to reduce the marginalization and humiliation that \r\nfuels the recruitment of terrorists.\r\nDialogue and the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nmake up the cornerstone of the foreign policy of a \r\ndemocratic Argentina. That is why I reiterate our call \r\nfor dialogue with the United Kingdom, as called for in \r\nmany resolutions of this Organization, so as to amicably \r\nresolve the sovereignty dispute that we have had for \r\nalmost two centuries over the Malvinas Islands, South \r\nGeorgia Islands and South Sandwich Islands and the \r\nsurrounding maritime areas. We have shown interest \r\nin advancing our bilateral relationship, which can and \r\nshould be mutually beneficial. That is why we trust that \r\nit will be possible to find a definitive solution to this \r\nprolonged dispute.\r\nI would like to conclude with a thought. Argentina, \r\nwhich has just celebrated 200 years of independence, \r\nis a country that has always opened its doors to men \r\nand women from around the world seeking a better \r\nlife. There is a piece of each part of the world in my \r\ncountry. We coexist peacefully — Christians, Jews \r\nand Muslims. Diversity enriches our society, and we \r\nembrace openness within a world where fragmentation \r\nis burgeoning. Let us say to the world, we need not fear \r\ninterdependency. This world is our shared home, which \r\nis why we must take care of it. We must learn to coexist \r\npeacefully, just as Pope Francis has called upon on us \r\nto do. Fostering a sense of integration and working \r\ntogether will only strengthen us. Let us continue to \r\nbuild networks and bridge gaps. The members of the \r\nAssembly can count on Argentina. We have much to \r\nsay and to contribute.\r\nPlease allow me to extend my gratitude to \r\nthe Secretary-General for his work in leading the \r\nOrganization. His legacy has difficult challenges, which \r\nis why we must continue with our efforts. Over the \r\nyears, the United Nations has shown us the importance \r\nof pursuing a better world. Now it is time for us to put \r\nforth all of our creativity and political will to make our \r\nvision of a better world a reality.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Argentine Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Mauricio Macri, President of the Argentine \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. François Hollande, President of the \r\nFrench Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe French Republic.\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the \r\nFrench Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. François \r\nHollande, President of the French Republic, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Hollande (spoken in French): It is always \r\nan honour for me to address the General Assembly. It is \r\nalso a responsibility — above all given the serious and \r\nworrying situation in the world. I stand before those \r\npresent on behalf of France to issue several appeals. \r\nFirst, I would like to ask all members to do everything \r\npossible to implement the historic Agreement that was \r\nsigned in Paris on 12 December 2015. The Agreement \r\nwas historic because the conference was held at a time \r\nwhen Paris, the capital of France, had been struck \r\nby terrorist attacks. The Agreement was historic \r\nbecause, for the first time, the assembled international \r\ncommunity agreed to make a commitment to reducing \r\nglobal warming and mobilizing financing, while \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 31/56\r\nallowing the most vulnerable countries to make an \r\nenergy transition.\r\nAnd yet, standing before the Assembly, let me \r\nstate once again that despite the momentous nature of \r\nthe Agreement, there is no time to lose. The past two \r\nyears have been the hottest known to humankind since \r\nrecords began. Admittedly, in April 2016, right here \r\nwith Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, an agreement \r\nwas signed with 175 countries. But everyone here \r\nknows that it will come into force only if it is ratified \r\nby 55 per cent of countries, representing 55 per cent \r\nof greenhouse-gas emissions. The United States and \r\nChina have announced their decision to ratify, which \r\nis very important. Nothing would have been possible \r\nwithout the participation and the commitment of \r\nthose two countries, which are the largest emitters of \r\ncarbon dioxide. France itself will notify the United \r\nNations tomorrow that it has completed its ratification \r\nprocedure. I appeal to all members to speed up their \r\nratification procedures so that the goal is met by the \r\nend of the year.\r\nThe twenty-first session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change (COP-21) was a conference of \r\ndecisions. The twenty-second session, to be held in \r\nMarrakech, should be a conference of solutions. It is \r\na question of implementing the International Solar \r\nAlliance, fighting desertification, protecting the seas \r\nand also setting a carbon price.\r\nHowever, the appeal I want to issue to the Assembly, \r\nfollowing this climate agreement, is an appeal for \r\nAfrica. Africa is a continent full of promise, but its \r\ndevelopment could be hindered by climate change, \r\nmigration, conflict, war and terrorism. The continent \r\nhas a bright future; however, it may also be the one to \r\ncause growing insecurity, and that insecurity targets, \r\nfirst and foremost, Africans themselves.\r\nThat is why, on behalf of France, I am proposing \r\na 2020 agenda for Africa. The plan should make it \r\npossible for all Africans to gain access to electricity. \r\nTwo thirds of Africans today are deprived of it. That is \r\nan injustice, but above all it impedes sustainable growth \r\nin Africa. What is at stake, therefore, is responding to \r\nthe needs of 15 per cent of the world population. What \r\nis at stake is enabling Africans to benefit from their \r\nimmense potential for development. What is at issue \r\nhere is reducing population displacements, that is, \r\nmigration, which leads to the destabilization of both \r\ncountries of origin and destination.\r\nThat is why, at the Paris Conference, I launched \r\nthe African Renewable Energy Initiative. Ten \r\ndonors — and I want thank them here — pledged \r\nto donate $10 billion by 2020. France has assumed \r\n20 per cent of that amount, or €2 billion. Europe has \r\ndecided on an external investment plan, which could \r\nreach — still with a view to providing Africans with \r\naccess to electricity — nearly €40 billion, and even \r\ndouble that amount if European Union member States \r\ncontribute as well. I call on all countries to join that \r\neffort. I am not just calling for solidarity here — for \r\nthis is a mutual investment that will benefit the whole \r\nworld — I call for this to happen as soon as possible.\r\nBut there will be no development in Africa unless \r\nthe continent’s security is ensured. When I committed \r\nFrance to acting in Mali, it did so with an awareness \r\nof its responsibility. We had to prevent terrorist groups \r\nfrom taking over an entire country and destabilizing \r\nan entire region. Today, that threat has been rolled \r\nback and Mali is regaining its territorial integrity. But \r\nother groups, including Boko Haram and Al-Qaida, are \r\nemerging to threaten the security of many countries in \r\nWest Africa, the Sahel and the Lake Chad region. There \r\ntoo, France is supporting military forces with training, \r\ninformation-sharing and assistance in the fight against \r\nterrorism. We are doing so, for instance, in the Niger, \r\nNigeria, Chad, Benin and Cameroon. We should \r\nexpand such efforts along with the United Nations and \r\nthe African Union.\r\nLet us be clear — the security of Africans has to \r\ncome from Africans themselves if we want to avoid \r\nexternal intrusion and interference. My appeal for \r\ndevelopment and renewable energy is also a call for \r\nthe security of Africans, for equipping their armies \r\nand giving them the means to respond, and for these \r\nAfrican nations to organize their own development in a \r\nfree and sovereign manner.\r\nThe last call I wish to make here is perhaps the \r\nsaddest of all. It is for Syria. The Syrian tragedy will \r\ngo down in history as a disgrace for the international \r\ncommunity if we do not end it quickly. Aleppo is \r\ntoday a martyred city, and this is how it shall remain \r\nin historical memory. Thousands of children have \r\ndied in bombings, entire populations are starving, \r\nhumanitarian convoys are being attacked, and chemical \r\nweapons are being used.\r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n32/56 16-29296\r\nI have one thing to say in this regard — enough \r\nis enough. Just like in February, the ceasefire held for \r\nonly a few days. It ended practically the day after its \r\nannouncement, before its terms were even understood. \r\nThe regime is responsible for its failure and cannot be \r\nexonerated for mistakes that could have been made \r\nby others. I would say to its foreign supporters — and \r\nwe all know who they are — that they need to compel \r\nthe regime’s hand to peace. If they do not then they, \r\nalongside the regime, shall bear responsibility for the \r\ndivision and chaos in Syria.\r\nThe Security Council must meet as soon as \r\npossible. It should not be a theatre of fools — in other \r\nwords, a place where responsibility can be evaded and \r\nwhere some can impede its work in order to protect a \r\nregime while they should be seeking a solution with us. \r\nFrance has four demands. First, we must first impose \r\nthe ceasefire in line with the decisions that have been \r\ntaken. That is the precondition. Secondly, we need to \r\nensure the immediate delivery of humanitarian aid to \r\nAleppo and other martyred cities. That is the priority. \r\nThirdly, we must ensure the resumption of political \r\nnegotiations along the lines of the transition established \r\nin 2012. That is the solution. Fourthly, we must sanction \r\nthe use of chemical weapons. That is justice.\r\nIf we take these decisions and act now, there will \r\nbe a solution for Syria. In fact, it will be more than \r\na solution; there will finally be hope for refugees and \r\ndisplaced persons. There will finally be action that \r\nwill allow Syria to maintain its territorial integrity. \r\nWe are also determined to see an intervention in \r\nIraq that will help to free the entire country from the \r\nDa’esh occupation of its territory. If we decide to act \r\neffectively against terrorism, we can prevent further \r\nterrorist attacks around the world. The risk is chaos \r\nand division, and it exists beyond Syria. It also exists \r\nin Libya. Our priority must be to re-establish the State \r\naround the Government of National Accord led by \r\nPrime Minister Al-Sarraj — a goal for which France is \r\nworking with its partners and the United Nations.\r\nWe cannot sit back and do nothing. That would be \r\nplaying into the hands of the forces, terrorists in particular, \r\nthat aim to destabilize the world. France shall never resign \r\nitself, even if it is difficult — especially if it is difficult — and \r\nthat is why it has taken the initiative to contribute to seeking \r\na solution to the conflict between Israel and Palestine. Of \r\ncourse, no one can impose a solution on the parties, but once \r\nagain, resigning ourselves to the status quo involves taking a \r\nrisk. It means allowing settlement to take place once again. It \r\nmeans once again allowing unjust, unfair and unacceptable \r\nviolence to take place. The objective, therefore, is to meet \r\nhere at the end of the year and hold a conference at which \r\nIsraelis and Palestinians can assume their responsibilities \r\nto negotiate.\r\nThis same spirit led me, along with Chancellor Merkel, \r\nto seek a solution in Ukraine. It led to the creation of the \r\nNormandy format, which allowed us to come to an agreement \r\nin Minsk. Today, we must do everything we can to ensure \r\nthat the agreement is implemented; if we do not, there will \r\nbe renewed violence and perhaps even the resumption of \r\nwar. I recall that this conflict has claimed more than 6,000 \r\nvictims. I have therefore taken the initiative, along with \r\nthe Chancellor of Germany, to bring together the Russian \r\nand Ukrainian Presidents in the weeks to come to promote \r\nprogress in the implementation of the Minsk accords.We \r\nwill not abandon that goal. We will renounce no initiative \r\nthat we think may be useful.\r\nI have raised the issue of terrorism, which threatens \r\nevery country of the world. Long is the list of all those whom \r\nit has impacted in Africa, the Middle East, Asia, Europe and \r\neven Oceania. No country can claim to be immune to the \r\nthreat of Islamist terrorism, fundamentalism and fanaticism, \r\nwhich have seduced and radicalized lost individuals within \r\nour societies. There is no sea or wall that can protect a country \r\nfrom this tragedy and the scourge of terrorist action, attacks \r\nor aggressions. Terrorism thrives on open conflicts that have \r\nremained unsolved for too long. It has provoked a wave of \r\nrefugees and undermined international order, borders that \r\nwe thought fixed, law that we thought we could maintain \r\nand the collective security that was the very principle of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nIn the face of these dangers, France once again turns \r\nto the United Nations. The United Nations has shown its \r\neffectiveness with the adoption of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change, which many thought was impossible. \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations have never been as \r\nnumerous as they are now.\r\nHowever, if we want to act to eradicate terrorism, \r\nwe will need to make decisions and not merely talk of \r\nsolidarity when a friendly country is attacked or merely \r\nexpress compassion for the victims. We must shoulder \r\nresponsibilities whenever that can be useful. That is \r\nwhat France does. Not because it is attacked — today, \r\nas I have said, every country is a target for terrorism. \r\nNo, France does it because it is a permanent member \r\nof the Security Council and its role is about acting, not \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 33/56\r\ncreating obstacles. France does it because it has one \r\ngreat idea, the idea that it has upheld throughout its \r\nhistory — bringing freedom, democracy and justice to \r\nthe world. It is because France puts its policies at the \r\nservice of a single goal — peace — and talks to everyone \r\ninvolved. It is because France is an independent nation \r\nthat respects the law and has no enemies other than \r\nthe forces of hatred and intolerance that use a betrayed \r\nreligion to create fear. It is because we must fight \r\nthe populists who exploit distress in order to divide, \r\nseparate, stigmatize and pit religions against one \r\nanother, risking confrontations that would have terrible \r\nconsequences for cohesion in our societies. France is \r\na secular country that proclaims itself as such but that \r\nspeaks to every religion and guarantees freedom of \r\nworship on its soil, because the only interests we have \r\nin the world are stability, development and the future \r\nof our planet.\r\nThat is why France is so committed to the United \r\nNations and demonstrates it every day. I want to pay \r\ntribute to the President of the General Assembly, to \r\nall who dedicate themselves to the United Nations, \r\nbeginning with Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, who \r\nfor 10 years has led this difficult mission on behalf \r\nof all of us and enabled us to advance its cause. And \r\nthat is also why, in the face of the major challenges I \r\nhave mentioned, especially Syria and the fight against \r\nterrorism, I expect the United Nations, and particularly \r\nthe Security Council, to shoulder its responsibilities. \r\nThere comes a moment for every generation and public \r\nofficial when the only question worth asking is whether \r\nwe have made decisions — and whether they are good \r\ndecisions. The countries here are all different sizes, \r\nat different levels of development and with different \r\nsensitivities and beliefs, but they should have only one \r\ngoal and one demand, which is that the world should \r\nrise to the challenges facing the planet.\r\nThat is why I want to appeal to all those here — to call \r\nfor implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, for ensuring that Africa and all Africans have \r\nelectricity and better development, and for peace in \r\nSyria, because it is so urgently needed. That is why \r\nI believe in the United Nations, and that is why both \r\nFrance and I are sending a universal message.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the French Republic for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. François Hollande, President of the French \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President \r\nof the Republic of Malawi\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Arthur Peter \r\nMutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mutharika: I am delighted and happy \r\nto be addressing the General Assembly today, and I \r\nwould like to join my fellow leaders in congratulating \r\nthe President on his election as its leader. The world has \r\nshown its confidence in him, and we are confident that \r\nhe will steer the ship to the shore of our dreams. His \r\nelection also testifies to our belief in the equality of our \r\nMember States, irrespective of their size.\r\nI would also like to sincerely commend His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, Secretary-General of the \r\nUnited Nations, for his exceptional leadership during \r\nhis tenure of office. We wish him every success in his \r\nfuture endeavours. I believe we will find an equally \r\ncompetent person to replace him. I have also noted with \r\nappreciation that the process of selecting the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has, for the first time in the history of the United \r\nNations, begun to address issues of transparency and \r\ndemocracy. If our job is to promote the political virtues \r\nof transparency and democracy around the world, we \r\nmust indeed also be the first to show ourselves to be \r\ntransparent and democratic.\r\nWe have engaged in a unanimous drive to transform \r\nour world. We have agreed that our road to a better \r\nworld must follow the signposts of the 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), which show us the road \r\nto ending poverty in the world. Today, we gather to \r\nlook back on the road of progress and to renew our \r\ncommitment to pursue those Goals to the end.\r\nThe mission of every generation should be to leave \r\nour world a better place for subsequent generations. \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n34/56 16-29296\r\nBut our generation faces mountains of challenges. Our \r\nworld stands in great peril. Innocent souls continue \r\nto suffer from the tragedy of wars. Many lives are \r\nmaimed, mutilated or cut short. Political instability \r\ncontinues to shake the foundations of our dreams. \r\nConflicts have scattered communities and driven them \r\nfrom their homes in endless migrations. We are caught \r\nin unending cycles of suffering, violence, terrorism, \r\nradicalization, extremism, abductions and human \r\ntrafficking. That is a story that we can have no pride \r\nin recounting to the next generations. Our world is \r\nliving a story of indignity and shame. Our planet is in \r\ngreat danger. Everywhere, global warming threatens \r\nour existence with hurricanes, cyclones, earthquakes, \r\nwildfires, extreme flooding and droughts, dangers \r\nthat threaten the fragile economies of Africa and the \r\nThird World everywhere. Africa, and the rest of the \r\ndeveloping world, is suffering from dehumanizing \r\npoverty, the pain of hunger, disease, inequalities and \r\ngender imbalances.\r\nMost of these are tragedies and challenges of our \r\nown creation. And the solutions lie in our hands. The \r\nchoices for human destiny around the world lie with us \r\nin the Assembly. Those challenges must be resolved by \r\nus, for nobody else can resolve them. It must be done \r\nhere, or nowhere else. It must be now, or never.\r\nWe have risen to the occasion of our times and \r\nbegun the journey of conquest with the adoption of \r\nthe 17 Sustainable Development Goals. But we have \r\nonly just begun. The sustainability of our pursuit \r\nand the attainment of our goals depend upon our \r\ncommon understanding and our walking together as a \r\ncommunity of humankind. Malawi is doing its part and \r\nwill continue to do its part. We continue to guarantee \r\nbasic human rights because we can progress only with \r\npeople who are free. We offer every care to our brothers \r\nand sisters who seek refuge in Malawi because we \r\nhave a duty to humankind. We ensure peace, stability, \r\nsecurity and tranquillity for everyone because we must \r\ncreate an environment for progress. We govern with the \r\nprinciples of democracy and the rule of law because \r\nhumankind is safe only when everybody is accountable. \r\nAnd we pledge to continue living in peace with all of \r\nour neighbours because we value peace and harmony.\r\nMalawi’s commitment to international peace \r\nand security is on record. We have been sending \r\npeacekeeping forces to various parts of Africa and \r\nbeyond for a long time. I am happy to report that \r\nMalawi’s record in peacekeeping is illustrative and \r\noutstanding. In that regard, we are committed to the \r\nwork of the United Nations. As a beacon of peace, we \r\nalso actively pursue the African Union’s (AU) Agenda \r\n2063 project “Silencing the guns by 2020” — and \r\nsilence the guns we must.\r\nOn the economic front, Malawi continues to register \r\nsteady but considerable progress, despite the attendant \r\nchallenges. The country registered a gross domestic \r\nproduct (GDP) growth rate of 3.2 per cent in 2015, as \r\ncompared with the global average of 3 per cent, and is \r\nexpected to reach 5 per cent in 2016. Although inflation \r\nhas been negatively affected by the food shortage, bulk \r\nmaize importation should help to reduce inflation and \r\nconsequently improve lending rates. Our domestic \r\nand foreign debts are within sustainable levels. And \r\nthe economy is progressively generating much-needed \r\njobs, particularly among our youth. Moving forward, \r\nthe combination of robust fiscal and macroeconomic \r\nreform programmes that the country is implementing \r\nis projected to lead to further GDP growth, single-digit \r\ninflation and low lending rates, which will in turn lead \r\nto increased confidence, greater investment, more jobs \r\nand improved incomes.\r\nOur only major setback in the last two years was \r\nthe effects of climate change. In 2015, we experienced \r\nterrible f loods that affected over half of the country. \r\nIn 2016, we endured just the opposite, as yet again half \r\nof the country was affected, this time by a scorching \r\ndrought. When we consider climate change, let us \r\nremember that there are real souls out there suffering the \r\neffects. We, as a country, will do our duty to humankind. \r\nThis afternoon, I will sign the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change here at Headquarters and commit my \r\nGovernment to the ratification and implementation of \r\nthat crucial document. Malawi has already adopted a \r\nclimate change policy, which will guide our domestic \r\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement. We are taking \r\naction on climate change.\r\nLet me also put on record that Malawi is making \r\nexemplary progress in the health sector. We are \r\npioneering innovative approaches to the management \r\nof the HIV/AIDS pandemic. We are among the \r\nfew countries on the African continent that have \r\nsuccessfully rolled out the test-and-treat programme. \r\nWe are managing the pandemic. But we need concerted \r\nefforts to manage non-communicable diseases such as \r\nhypertension, diabetes and cancer.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 35/56\r\nOn gender equality, Malawi is taking proactive \r\nmeasures to reduce the vulnerability of women and \r\nadolescent girls to violence and abuse. Consequently, \r\nwe are focusing on addressing gender-based violence \r\nand balancing reproductive and productive roles in order \r\nto enhance women’s participation in decision-making. \r\nThis work entails collaboration with traditional leaders, \r\nin order to tackle retrogressive traditional practices \r\nthat harm our women and the girl child. We have \r\nalso enhanced legal and policy reforms and improved \r\nour law enforcement mechanism in that area. We are \r\nadopting the Gender Equality Act: Implementation and \r\nMonitoring Plan 2016-2020 as well as improved gender-\r\nsensitive data-collection approaches.\r\nOn trade issues, investment and market access, \r\nMalawi continues to open up the economy and offer \r\nnumerous investment opportunities. We have opened up \r\nto investors in the mining, manufacturing, agriculture \r\nand adding value, tourism, transport, water, energy \r\nand financial sectors. We are rapidly improving our \r\nbusiness climate. We are ready to do business with \r\nthe world. I therefore invite the global community to \r\npatronize the annual Malawi Investment Forum, to be \r\nheld in Lilongwe on 10 and 11 October. It is imperative \r\nthat regional and global markets be free of distortions \r\nsuch as subsidies, tariffs and non-tariff barriers. We \r\nmust live up to the aspirations of the World Trade \r\nOrganization Doha Development Agenda. The global \r\ncommunity must realize that it is only by taking such \r\nsteps that African countries will be able to produce \r\nand add value to their commodities. That will generate \r\nthe necessary jobs to keep our young people in the \r\ncontinent and propel our economies to sustainable \r\ngrowth and prosperity.\r\nWithout investments in those areas, it will continue \r\nto be a challenge to prevent African youth from \r\ntaking desperate and dangerous action by crossing the \r\nseas and oceans to reach developed economies. Such \r\ninvestments will also reduce the risk of our youth being \r\nlured into radicalism and extremism, with the attendant \r\nthreat to domestic and international peace and security. \r\nI must underline that poverty in African communities \r\nis a danger to the global community because poverty \r\nand the disenchantment of our youth can be an easy \r\nsource of radicalization.\r\nSpeaking in my capacity as United Nations Youth \r\nChampion, I am fully committed to the promotion of \r\nyouth development and harnessing the demographic \r\ndividend in Malawi, across the African Continent and \r\nbeyond. I am delighted to report that the African Union \r\nhas adopted “Harnessing the Demographic Dividend” \r\nas its theme for 2017. I wish, therefore, to call upon \r\nglobal leaders to join the efforts of the African Union \r\nand our global partners in prioritizing investments \r\nin our youth, in order to accelerate socioeconomic \r\ntransformation and development at the global level.\r\nOn United Nations reform, the common African \r\nposition is the one espoused as the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus and the Sirte Declaration. Our firm belief \r\nis that the attainment of the SDGs cannot happen in an \r\nenvironment that is devoid of representation, fairness, \r\nefficiency, transparency and accountability, such as at \r\nthe Security Council. My country therefore earnestly \r\nsupports all efforts and work currently under way to \r\nfind a suitable vehicle for the reform and revitalization \r\nof the United Nations, and shall seek every possible way \r\nto contribute to the appropriate solution on the matter.\r\nLet me conclude by reiterating that Malawi is \r\nmaking every effort to overcome the decades of \r\nunderdevelopment, disease and hunger that have \r\nretarded the development of the country. That is our \r\nquest for the dignity of our people and their place in \r\nthe world. Malawi is set to be a productive partner in \r\nour collective push to transform our world. We are the \r\nleaders of that transformation. We are the generation \r\nthat must transform the world. History demands our \r\ncollective leadership.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Malawi for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the \r\nEastern Republic of Uruguay\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Eastern Republic of Uruguay.\r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern \r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Tabaré \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n36/56 16-29296\r\nVázquez, President of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Vázquez (spoke in Spanish): As a citizen \r\nand the President of the Eastern Republic of Uruguay, \r\nit is an honour for me to speak to the General Assembly \r\nagain from this rostrum. In this forum, which is the \r\nlargest and most representative of humankind today, I \r\noffer the greetings of the citizens and the Government \r\nof my country. Our greetings reflect the values  of peace, \r\nfreedom, democracy, justice and solidarity, which \r\ndefine our nation and the United Nations, which we \r\nhelped found in 1945, and today we are a non-permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council.\r\nAs this is not my first time here, I run the risk of \r\nrepeating what I said on previous occasions, and in \r\nparticular what I said on 29 September 2016 in the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventieth session (see A/70/\r\nPV.16). But I am taking that risk because, with only a \r\nfew exceptions, all the issues that I raised a year ago \r\ncan be conveyed in the same terms and, in some cases, \r\neven graver ones.\r\nLet us be clear: I do not say that as a reproach, \r\nand even less so as self-praise. It is painfully obvious, \r\nhowever, that despite the efforts of the United Nations \r\nto fight terrorism, violence, intolerance, discrimination, \r\npoverty, inequality, injustice and organized crime, these \r\nscourges continue to plague much of humankind. For it \r\nis our modest belief that the task of Governments and, \r\nmoreover, of rulers — that is to say, our task, which \r\nhas been entrusted to us by our citizens — cannot \r\nbe limited to making assessments and telling people \r\nwhat is amiss. Our unconditional duty is to create the \r\nconditions for our people to build their own lives in \r\nsociety and to support them in that task. What I am \r\nsaying does not seem like much, but it is a lot.\r\nWithout ignoring the enormous importance of \r\nother issues under consideration by the Assembly, let \r\nme refer to one that perhaps is not in the news, but it \r\nis certainly important because, as the data provided \r\nby the World Health Organization shows it is the \r\nprimary cause of mortality throughout the world, \r\nespecially in low- and middle- income countries. I am \r\nmainly talking about non-communicable diseases, in \r\nparticular cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and \r\nchronic pulmonary diseases. Clearly, the consequent \r\nterrible impact that these diseases have on humankind \r\nf ly under the radar of our Governments, but they \r\nnevertheless tragically affect the lives of our peoples. \r\nAnd these avoidable diseases are largely due to four risk \r\nfactors directly linked to supposedly typically modern \r\nbehaviours, that is, smoking, alcohol consumption, \r\nunhealthy diet and physical inactivity.\r\nThe primary effects of those risk factors are \r\ndramatically felt increasingly in middle- and low-income \r\ncountries, and the poorest people in every country, \r\nstrongly reflecting the underlying socioeconomic \r\ndeterminers. Among these populations, the conditions \r\nare ripe for creating a vicious cycle. Poverty exposes \r\npeople to the behavioural risk factors that lead to \r\nnon-communicable diseases and these, in turn, tend to \r\nworsen the state of poverty of the affected individuals \r\nand families. Health systems are also affected by the \r\nimpact of the high costs of the treatments that are \r\nneeded to treat chronic non-communicable diseases. To \r\ngive an idea of the financial implications, and without \r\nbeing dramatic, I want to draw members’ attention to the \r\nfollowing statistics, which they certainly already know.\r\nFirst, the direct cost of smoking on the national \r\nhealth-care systems of Latin America is estimated at \r\n$33 billion. That is the equivalent to 0.5 per cent of the \r\ngross domestic product of our region and 7 per cent \r\nof what it spends annually on health care. And the tax \r\nthat our countries impose on tobacco products does not \r\namount to 50 per cent of the costs of illnesses directly \r\ncaused by smoking. Secondly, in 2009 the overall \r\nestimated economic cost of cancer in Mexico, the \r\nCaribbean and Central and South America amounted \r\nto an estimated $286 billion in direct costs — for \r\nexample, doctors’ visits and medical analyses — and \r\nindirect costs, including travel and lodging expenses \r\nand lost workdays and productivity, among others. \r\nTherefore, in our humble view, unless we vigorously \r\nfight the epidemic of non-communicable diseases in \r\ncountries and social groups that are most exposed or \r\naffected, the impact of those diseases will grow. And \r\nthe plausible global goal of reducing poverty, which is \r\ntimely and adopted by the Assembly as the condition \r\nsine qua non for sustainable development, rather than \r\ndrawing closer, dramatically, retreats more each day \r\nbeyond our reach.\r\nIf we look at the statistics available, in a single \r\nworking day approximately 104,109 people worldwide \r\nwill die today as a result of the diseases I mentioned. \r\nHow then can we not design and implement strategies \r\nto control alcohol and tobacco consumption and to \r\npromote healthful lifestyles, such as a healthful diet and \r\nphysical exercise. No doubt what I am saying here is a \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 37/56\r\nfar cry from what those who preceded me in addressing \r\nthe Assembly have said. While I hope I am mistaken, \r\nif we do not take appropriate measures, our countries, \r\nespecially the poorest and most humble among them, \r\nwill suffer dramatic consequences due to those diseases, \r\nwhich, I repeat, can be prevented. Of course, this is \r\nnot a medical panel or a scientific symposium. But as \r\na political leader who has not forgotten his medical \r\nprofession and continues to be involved in it, allow me \r\nto tell the Assembly that not only is it possible to design \r\nand implement such strategies, but that very positive \r\nresults can be achieved.\r\nThose are not easy or simply strategies, but they are \r\nessential and can yield good results. Uruguayans know \r\nthis from our own real-life experiences. But more than \r\nthat, we have in place actual projects that we are working \r\non. As on this issue there is also no future without \r\nsolidarity, we call upon all countries, Governments and \r\npeoples, non-governmental organizations, as well as \r\nscientific, medical and international organizations, to \r\nform an alliance under the United Nations against the \r\nepidemic of non-communicable diseases — an alliance \r\nfor a healthy life and as broad, vigorous and dynamic \r\nas possible. It is possible — not easy, but possible. In \r\nmany ways, more than financial resources, it requires \r\nconviction and political will to go ahead.\r\nUruguay is a world leader in the implementation \r\nof the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control. But \r\nthere have been opponents to that leadership. Among \r\nthem, at the beginning of the year 2010, a claim was \r\nbrought before the International Centre for Settlement \r\nof Investment Disputes by the tobacco firm Philip \r\nMorris. That company was suing our country because \r\nof its opposition to two regulations adopted by our \r\ncountry in order to control tobacco. In addition to \r\nthe formal arguments brought by that tobacco firm, \r\nthe main reason for its action was to punish a small \r\ncountry like Uruguay that had decided to control \r\ntobacco consumption and to work hard for the health \r\nand right to live of our people. The lawsuit was a \r\npunishment, using our small country as an example, so \r\nthat all countries that were implementing or planning to \r\nimplement similar policies would learn from this lesson \r\nnot to go forward with them.\r\nThe proceedings were lenghthy, meandering \r\nand costly. In the end, though, on 8 July, the arbitral \r\ntribunal of the International Centre for Settlement of \r\nInvestment Disputes handed down its final ruling. \r\nIt was decisively favourable to Uruguay. None of \r\nthe claimants’ arguments were accepted and, more \r\nimportant, the policies adopted by our country were \r\nrecognized as sovereign, legitimate and in line with the \r\ninternational commitments Uruguay had undertaken \r\nand in accord with international law. But things do \r\nnot happen by coincidence. In that regard, I would \r\nlike to thank the World Health Organization, many of \r\nthe countries represented here and all the institutions \r\nand individuals who in one way or another supported \r\nUruguay’s cause in this dispute. I thank all of them \r\nsincerely on behalf of the Uruguayan people. The \r\nbest way to return such support — and without being \r\nignorant of the circumstances under which we live \r\ntoday — we commit ourselves to continue working \r\nhard, as our modest means allow — to help all the \r\npeople of the world succeed in meaningfully defending \r\ntheir rights to health and life.\r\nUruguay is not unaware of the circumstances in \r\nother regions of the world. Again, we are not indifferent. \r\nAllow me to address some of those issues.\r\nFirst, we would like to congratulate the Government \r\nof Colombia and the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias \r\nde Colombia. We reiterate to them our willingness and \r\nreadiness to continue cooperating with the parties in \r\nthe new and demanding stages of the peace process.\r\nSecondly, in our address to the General Assembly \r\nin 2015 (see A/70/PV.16) we expressed our desire that \r\nthe seventieth session would be the last at which our \r\ncountry had to call for an end to the economic, trade \r\nand financial embargo so unfairly imposed by the \r\nUnited States on Cuba. So long as the embargo remains \r\nin place, Uruguay will continue to demand here its \r\ndefinitive lifting.\r\nThirdly, we are not indifferent to the complex \r\npolitical and institutional situations that exist in several \r\nbrother nations. As good brothers, we hope that such \r\ndifficulties will sovereignly resolved on the basis of \r\ndemocratic institutional frameworks and in a calm, \r\nrespectful and sincere dialogue among the parties \r\ninvolved. The will of citizens, the will of the people, \r\nmust be thoroughly respected.\r\nI very much appreciate the attention the Assembly \r\nhas given to me today. On behalf of the Uruguayan \r\npeople, a small country in South America’s Southern \r\nCone, I would like to reiterate that, within our modest \r\nmeans, we will continue to work with members to \r\nstrive for a more fraternal world with more solidarity \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n38/56 16-29296\r\nfor more social justice, with peace, with respect and \r\nwith tolerance for all inhabitants of the planet.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Eastern Republic of Uruguay for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Tabaré Vázquez, President of the Eastern \r\nRepublic of Uruguay, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Abdullah II ibn Al \r\nHussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Majesty \r\nKing Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King of the Hashemite \r\nKingdom of Jordan.\r\nKing Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Majesty King Abdullah II bin \r\nAl Нussein, King of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nKing Abdullah II: Allow me to express today my \r\nhighest regard for Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for \r\nhis dedication and tireless efforts to advance the cause \r\nof peace and global harmony. I have deeply appreciated \r\nour work together over the past 10 years.\r\nAs I stand here today, elections to Jordan’s national \r\nParliament are coming to a conclusion. It is one more \r\nstep on our country’s positive evolutionary path — a \r\npath to which we have insistently conformed despite \r\nregional turbulence and a massive refugee burden. It \r\nrepresents an achievement that can be credited largely to \r\nour citizens, especially our youth, who have stubbornly \r\nheld to Jordan’s heritage of unity, strength and forward-\r\nlooking spirit in spite of the odds. And it is those very \r\nodds that make the elections a true triumph of progress \r\nover regression.\r\nAs we gather here today, there are forces at play in \r\nmy region and beyond whose sole purpose is to stack \r\nthe odds against the core values that bind our common \r\nhumanity. I am referring, of course, to the network \r\nof extremist terrorists who have dominated headlines \r\nof late. And they seek global dominance as well. \r\nThey want to wipe out our achievements and those of \r\nour ancestors, to erase them and drag us back to the \r\nDark Ages.\r\nThe question we must ask ourselves as we face \r\nthe battle of our generation is what our legacy will be. \r\nWill we pass on to our children a world dominated by \r\ndread and division, where safety and security will be at \r\nthe forefront of their minds as they board an airplane, \r\nattend a concert or football match, or stroll through \r\na mall? Most important, are we doing what must be \r\ndone to confront and decisively defeat this evil force, \r\nso that our children can live in a world where fear and \r\nsuspicion are replaced by human comradery and hope, \r\nso they can reach their fullest potential and add to the \r\nstockpile of human achievement accrued over the ages?\r\nAs much as I wish it were otherwise, sadly the \r\nanswer to those questions is no. How can we be \r\neffective in this fight when we have not clearly defined \r\nwho the enemy is? Who are we fighting with, and who \r\nare we fighting against? And I am struck today, after \r\nseveral years of facing the global war on terror, by the \r\nlack of understanding of the true nature of Islam that I \r\nfind among many Western officials, think tanks, media \r\nleaders and policymakers. I find myself stating the \r\nobvious again and again.\r\nFalse perceptions of Islam and of Muslims serve \r\nto fuel the terrorists’ agenda of a global struggle \r\nby polarizing and factionalizing societies East and \r\nWest — each side stigmatizing the other and each side \r\ndriven deeper into mistrust and intolerance. Muslims, a \r\nquarter of the world’s population and citizens of every \r\ncountry, have a central role in the future of our planet. \r\nMuslim men and women bring the world a rich heritage \r\nof civic responsibility, justice, generosity, family life, \r\nand faith in God.\r\nWhen some, out of prejudice or ignorance of what \r\nIslam is, seek to exclude Muslims from fulfilling their \r\nrole, or on the other hand, when the outlaws of Islam, \r\nthe khawarij, attempt to mislead some Muslims by \r\ndeforming our religion through false teachings, our \r\nsocieties’ future is put at risk. When the outlaws of \r\nIslams, the khawarij, murder, when they plunder, when \r\nthey exploit children and reject the equality of women \r\nbefore God, they abuse Islam. When the khawarij \r\npersecute minorities, when they deny freedom of \r\nreligion, they abuse Islam.\r\nIslam teaches that all humanity is equal in dignity. \r\nThere is no distinction among the various nations or \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 39/56\r\nreligions or races. The Quran forbids coercion in religion. \r\nEvery citizen is guaranteed the State’s protection \r\nfor themselves, their families, their properties, their \r\nhonour, their privacy, and their freedom of religion and \r\nthought. Muslims believe in the divine origins of the \r\nBible and the Torah. God says in the Koran:\r\n“Say Ye: ‘We believe in Allah, and the \r\nrevelation given to us, and to Abraham, Ishmael \r\nand Isaac and Jacob, and the tribes, and that given \r\nto Moses and Jesus, and that given to the Prophets \r\nfrom their Lord: We make no difference between \r\none and another of them: and we submit to Allah.’” \r\n(The Holy Koran, II:136)\r\nIndeed, the prophet mentioned most in the Koran is \r\nMoses, named 136 times. Jesus, whom we call “Christ \r\nMessiah,” is named 25 times. His mother, Mary, called \r\n“best of all women in creation,” is named 35 times, \r\nand there is a chapter in the Quran called Maryam. \r\nThe khawarij deliberately hide these truths about \r\nIslam in order to drive Muslims and non-Muslims \r\napart. We cannot allow that to happen. Once we \r\nunderstand that this is a battle that we must fight \r\ntogether — all religions and all of us who believe in the \r\ndignity, freedom, and well-being that is the birthright \r\nof every individual — then we can turn towards our \r\ncommon enemy and examine through a clear lens the \r\nunique nature of our foe.\r\nLet me state clearly that those radical outlaw groups \r\ndo not exist on the fringes of Islam. They are altogether \r\noutside of it. Thus, we refer to them as khawarij: \r\noutlaws of Islam. They declare the entire civilized \r\nworld as the enemy and all people, military or civilian, \r\nas fair game. They aim to incubate satellite caliphates \r\nin every country of the world in order to extend their \r\nreach. They are also expanding fast and wide through \r\ntheir mastery and exploitation of modern technology, \r\nincluding social media. To confront this non-traditional \r\nenemy, we need non-traditional means, a new mindset, \r\nnew partnerships and reformed methodologies. For \r\nMuslims, first and foremost this is a fight for our \r\nfuture. All elements of our community have a role \r\nto play, not only in mosques and religious centers, \r\nbut media, schools, and communities. Let no one be \r\nmisled: traditional Sunni Islam and all of its schools of \r\njurisprudence decisively reject the ideas and claims of \r\nthe takfiri jihadists. Muslims need to help identify and \r\ncounter the outlaws of Islam who pick and choose and \r\ncut and paste religious texts in order to twist and distort \r\ntrue Islamic teaching.\r\nThe international community also faces a fight for \r\nthe future. The war will not be fought on the battlefield \r\nalone. Our adversary has brought the fight to every place \r\nwhere humans live and interact: airports, cafes and city \r\nstreets. Security cooperation is imperative, but equally \r\nimportant is a holistic approach. We need to open up \r\nnew channels between continents and nations, within \r\ncountries and among people. That means reforming the \r\nway we communicate, share information and use our \r\ntechnologies. The very same modern communication \r\ntools used against us must be employed by us, and \r\nwe can do that while respecting the important issue \r\nof privacy. Creative innovators in the private sector, \r\nespecially in the technology sector, are vital for our \r\nfuture and must be brought on board.\r\nOurs is a global fight. The focus must not stop with \r\nthe Middle East, but must reach far beyond into West \r\nand East Africa, South-East Asia and the Balkans. In \r\nSyria, a military approach will leave no winners, but \r\nonly losers on every side and further civilian suffering. \r\nEnding violence ultimately demands a political \r\nprocess — one shepherded by a unified global vision \r\nand led by all of the Syrian people. In Iraq, international \r\nsupport remains critical as the Government and the \r\npeople continue to uproot the khawarij. However, key \r\nto achieving and sustaining any success is an inclusive \r\napproach that engages all components of the country in \r\nthe political process and in State institutions.\r\nAs we pursue those goals, the international \r\ncommunity must also take responsibility for those \r\nwhose lives have been crushed and who have been \r\nimpoverished. I am referring to the millions of refugees \r\nand victims. We cannot decisively defeat the scourge of \r\nterror and violence without decisively rooting out the \r\ninjustices that provide it with fertile ground. From the \r\nAbu Ghraib prison to the streets of Kabul and schools in \r\nAleppo, injustice and humiliation have left tremendous \r\nhuman suffering in their wake.\r\nNo injustice has spread more bitter fruit than the \r\ndenial of a Palestinian State. I believe that peace is a \r\nconscious decision. Israel has to embrace peace, or \r\neventually be engulfed in a sea of hatred in a region \r\nof turmoil. Safeguarding Jerusalem is a key concern, \r\nas the Holy City is a strategic linchpin not only for my \r\nregion but for the world.\r\nThat is a priority for me personally and for all \r\nMuslims. We utterly reject attacks on Muslim and \r\nChristian holy sites and any attempts to alter the historic \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n40/56 16-29296\r\nMuslim, Christian and Arab identity of the Holy City. \r\nAs the Custodian of Islamic Holy Sites in Jerusalem, \r\nI will continue my efforts to protect those places \r\nand stand up against all violations of their sanctity, \r\nincluding attempts to establish temporal and spatial \r\ndivisions restricting free use of the Al-Aqsa Mosque on \r\nHaram Al-Sharif.\r\nPerhaps the central and most vital battleground for \r\nthis defining war of our generation is the mind. The \r\ndespicable, damaging ideology of hate, murder and self-\r\ndestruction that is being spread in crash courses online \r\nand elsewhere must be confronted with a counter-\r\nnarrative of hope, tolerance and peace. Together, in the \r\nGeneral Assembly and in our regions, countries and \r\ncommunities across the world, we have the power to \r\ncreate that counter-narrative. Let us show that we also \r\nhave the will to act.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the King of \r\nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nKing Abdullah II ibn Al Hussein, King of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was escorted from \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Johann Schneider-Ammann, \r\nPresident of the Swiss Confederation\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Swiss Confederation.\r\nMr. Johann Schneider-Ammann, President of the \r\nSwiss Confederation, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Johann Schneider-Ammann, President of the \r\nSwiss Confederation, and to invite him to address the \r\nAssembly.\r\nPresident Schneider-Ammann (spoke in French): \r\nOn 26 July in Abu Dhabi, the Swiss solar-powered \r\nplane, Solar Impulse, finished its world tour. On \r\nthe same day that the whole world commended that \r\ntechnical feat, the International Organization for \r\nMigration issued a statement saying that, since the \r\nbeginning of 2016, more than 3,000 migrants had \r\nlost their lives in the Mediterranean Sea. That shows \r\nus that once again humankind is capable of the best \r\nand the worst: excellence in innovation at the service \r\nof the environment, but also powerlessness and a \r\ncertain inertia in the face of immense tragedy, born of \r\ndictatorship, poverty and warfare.\r\nThe challenges facing the international community \r\nare extensive. The situation in the Middle East and \r\nin certain regions of Africa, as well as at the gates \r\nof Europe, represent a tragic example of that. The \r\nweakening of States, economies and societies fosters \r\nthe radicalization that can lead to terrorism and \r\narmed conflict, which bring with them their corollary \r\nvictims — refugees and displaced persons. The \r\nconsequences affect us all. Additional threats remain, \r\nsuch as natural disasters, climate change and its impacts \r\nand, indeed, antimicrobial resistance. Economic crises \r\nand the vicious cycle of unemployment, vulnerability \r\nand social exclusion that accompanies them are of \r\nconcern to decision-makers around the world.\r\nIn the face of the scale of those challenges, a \r\nstrong United Nations is more necessary than ever. \r\nThe Organization has already proved what it is capable \r\nof. Its tireless efforts to mobilize the international \r\ncommunity within the framework of various action \r\nplans have prolonged the all-important liberalization of \r\nthe global economy. Over the past 20 years, the United \r\nNations has helped to reduce extreme poverty rates by \r\nhalf and increase average life expectancy. Thanks to \r\nUnited Nations incentives, education for the world’s \r\npopulations has improved. The involvement of the \r\nprivate sector and civil society in global governance is \r\nconstantly growing.\r\nThere is another signal of hope, namely, the \r\nrecent peace agreement in Colombia. Switzerland, the \r\ndepositary of the agreement, commends all the parties \r\ninvolved for that breakthrough on the road to lasting \r\npeace. Our generation is the first since the beginning of \r\nthe twentieth century not to have lived through a world \r\nwar. The United Nations has greatly contributed to that \r\noutcome, even if we must admit that there are still too \r\nmany regional conflicts and that those conflicts have \r\nresulted in too many victims.\r\nBecause of its universality, the United Nations has \r\na unique legitimacy, which gives rise to a monumental \r\nresponsibility, with the number of its initiatives, \r\nagreements and processes constantly multiplying. A \r\nnew global vision is taking shape, and all States are \r\ninvolved. Among the cornerstones of that vision is the \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 41/56\r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which is the \r\ncommon framework for the development of sustainable \r\nsolutions. It provides the basis for a renewed social \r\ncontract between leaders and populations.\r\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, which \r\nseeks to limit global warming, is a strong sign of the \r\ncommitment of States. The recent decision of the United \r\nStates and China to ratify the Agreement is a very \r\nimportant step towards ensuring its success. The first \r\nWorld Humanitarian Summit, held in Istanbul, which \r\nhelped to develop solutions aimed at helping people \r\naffected by crises and disasters, is further evidence of \r\ninternational solidarity. Furthermore, the review of the \r\nUnited Nations peace and security architecture, which \r\nwe recently completed, highlighted the importance of \r\nconflict prevention.\r\nFinally, this year we celebrate the tenth anniversary \r\nof the Human Rights Council, which has substantially \r\ncontributed to the promotion and defence of human \r\nrights. A further step is now needed to strengthen the \r\ninfluence of its actions on the ground. The “Appeal of \r\n13 June”, launched by Switzerland and supported today \r\nby 70 States, rightly proposes to improve conflict-\r\nprevention activities by more systematically integrating \r\nthe human rights dimension, including strengthening \r\nthe links between the Human Rights Council and the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nIn recent years, we have provided ourselves with \r\nvaluable tools to build a better world; now it is time \r\nto use them. In that context, I would like to express \r\nour gratitude to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, \r\nwho, during a decade of hard work, has enabled the \r\nUnited Nations to make significant advances. We are \r\nconvinced that his successor will continue the work and \r\nreform of the United Nations.\r\nOur approach in this crucial phase must be based \r\non principles that are dear to us, the Swiss, namely, \r\nthe principles of inclusion and participation. I am \r\nconvinced that by acting together we will succeed in \r\nmeeting all the Goals of the 2030 Agenda. Switzerland \r\nwas one of the first countries to introduce national \r\nmeasures aimed at implementing the 2030 Agenda. We \r\nare determined to follow through on that commitment.\r\nI hold the deep conviction that, in order to achieve \r\nthe goals that we have set, we must have a sound \r\neconomy. Promoting sustainable economic growth \r\nmeans making commitments that favour societies that \r\noffer equitable opportunities for all their members. \r\nA thriving economy is a primary objective, because \r\nit is a essential tool for creating opportunities for all \r\ncitizens. A thriving economy makes it easier for young \r\npeople, women and older workers to enter the labour \r\nmarket. I see that as absolutely consistent with the \r\ncommitments undertaken by the United Nations. For a \r\ndynamic economy that provides jobs and opportunities \r\nis an important factor in preventing terrorist abuses and \r\narmed conflict.\r\nIn Switzerland, we have identified three key \r\nelements that enable us to regularly be at the forefront \r\nof innovation and competitiveness.\r\nFirst, we have an effective training system that \r\nreflects the needs of the real economy as well as those \r\nof basic research. University courses and vocational \r\nprogrammes in Switzerland benefit from the same \r\nattention and the same care. Enterprise learning \r\nenriched by theoretical training in vocational schools \r\nplays a central role in the system.\r\nSecondly, our liberal labour laws allow companies \r\nto evolve with the markets, participate in and contribute \r\nto technological progress and easily adopt innovative \r\nmethods and products. The f lexibility of our economy \r\nbecomes the best guarantee of employment.\r\nThirdly, we have in place an effective and respected \r\nsocial partnership that ensures industrial peace. Regular \r\nnegotiations between representatives of employers and \r\nemployees ensure that labour agreements are f lexible \r\nand accepted by all, and meet the needs of industries \r\nand regions.\r\nBut those key elements cannot produce positive \r\neffects without international trade. Exchanges \r\nstimulate competition, scientific and technological \r\nprogress and innovation. And we should never forget \r\nthat freedom expressed through democracy and framed \r\nby the rule of law is the best guarantee in ensuring that \r\na company may realize its full economic, scientific and \r\ncultural potential.\r\nIt is also important to meet the challenges of \r\nglobalization in the digital domain, not only in terms \r\nof transparency, data security and equal opportunities, \r\nbut also from the perspective of the opportunities of \r\ntechnological, social, political and economic progress. \r\nIn an open and democratic society, it is certainly \r\nvital that people be able to use digital technologies in \r\ninformed and safe ways. However, we must also do \r\neverything possible to ensure that the new possibilities \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n42/56 16-29296\r\noffered by digitization facilitate access to employment \r\nrather than make employment more precarious.\r\nIt is easy to forecast that digitization will make \r\njobs disappear. But that is not what matters; the real \r\nchallenge is to identify the new jobs that it will create. \r\nFor it is only by making that effort that we can put in \r\nplace the training that will allow the greatest number of \r\npeople to find jobs in tomorrow’s world. In order succeed \r\nin that effort, we need to engage in dialogue with the \r\nmost innovative companies. The United Nations and its \r\nspecialized agencies can help ensure that all countries \r\ncan take advantage of the opportunities offered by \r\ntechnological progress.\r\nSpeaking of the challenges facing the United \r\nNations and the international community leads \r\nus naturally to Geneva as an international city. \r\nSwitzerland is committed to prioritizing that city as \r\na centre of global governance. We are supporting the \r\nmodernization of the city’s real estate, but we are \r\nalso strengthening synergies between the various \r\nstakeholders in international Geneva, whether in \r\nthe field of global health or of humanitarian action. \r\nThere have been a number of initiatives in Geneva in \r\nrecent months, namely, the Appeal of 13 June to Put \r\nHuman Rights at the Heart of Conflict Prevention, the \r\nlaunch of a High-level Panel on Water and Peace, the \r\norganization of a conference on the prevention of violent \r\nextremism, and also various kinds of peace talks and \r\nnegotiations. They are all evidence of the importance \r\nof Geneva as an international city and of Switzerland’s \r\ncommitment. It is a place that is useful for the world, \r\nand we will continue to commit to ensuring that its role \r\nis strengthened.\r\nI am wholeheartedly convinced that the only viable \r\nresponses to the contemporary challenges that we \r\nface are to be found in collective and solidarity-based \r\nsolutions. To find such solutions, the international \r\ncommunity needs a strong United Nations that is also \r\nmodern and effective. That is the path we must take. \r\nTogether, we must now support the Organization with \r\nvision and determination.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Swiss Confederation for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Johann Schneider-Ammann, President of \r\nthe Swiss Confederation, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Godard, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Peru\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru\r\nMr. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Godard, President of \r\nthe Republic of Peru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Pedro Pablo \r\nKuczynski Godard, President of the Republic of Peru, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kuczynski Godard (spoke in Spanish): \r\nIt is an honour to address the General Assembly, \r\nto congratulate the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession, and to express Peru’s willingness to contribute \r\nto the success of his stewardship.\r\nTwo months ago, when I began my term as President \r\nof the Republic of Peru, I expressed a commitment to the \r\ngoals set forth by the founders of our Republic. In 2021, \r\nPeruvians will celebrate 200 years of our independent \r\nlife, thereby consolidating a sound democracy, one \r\nthat is socially functional and prosperous, with better \r\nopportunities for jobs and equality and where human \r\nrights are promoted. Our Government’s plans and public \r\npolicies coincide with the United Nations Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, which are enshrined in the 2030 \r\nAgenda. They include access to water, education, health \r\ncare for all Peruvians and other services that are vital \r\nin order to drastically reduce poverty, in the context of \r\na full-scale battle against corruption, discrimination, \r\ninsecurity and drug trafficking.\r\nOne key objective of my Government is to ensure \r\nthe efficient management of safe water and sanitation \r\nfor all. We will ensure access to drinking water and \r\nsewerage systems for all those families that do not \r\nnow have such basic services, which accounts for \r\nabout 10 million inhabitants, or almost a third of our \r\npeople. We will make a significant investment that will \r\nprioritize the Amazon and Andean regions. We will \r\nwork with non-traditional systems for potable water \r\nfor non-urban areas, and we will implement systems \r\nfor rainwater-harvesting in the Amazon and undertake \r\npublic works through the reforestation programme \r\nknown as “Blue Mountains”, aimed at harvesting water \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 43/56\r\nin the highlands of the Andean Mountains. I believe \r\nthat interaction with the United Nations in that regard \r\nis a priority. I am therefore very honoured to have \r\nparticipated in the High-level Panel on Water just a few \r\ndays ago.\r\nAnother very important issue for my Government \r\nis to promote green growth, while coordinating the \r\nuse of land-based and marine ecosystems. The Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change should serve as an \r\ninspiration for us to implement those policies. Peru is a \r\ncountry that is particularly vulnerable, and we see that \r\non a daily basis in the melting of our glaciers and in the \r\nextreme cold that occurs in southern Peru sometimes, \r\nboth of which have compelled us to redirect our scarce \r\nresources to meet those challenges.\r\nPeru is promoting such policies so as to become \r\na member, as quickly as possible, of the Organization \r\nfor Economic Cooperation and Development. My \r\nGovernment’s Administration has a clear vision of \r\nthe new challenges and responsibilities that Peru must \r\ngrapple with, which leads us to deepen our agreements \r\nwith countries that have similar prospects, problems \r\nand challenges. They include our partners in the Pacific \r\nAlliance, namely, Colombia, Chile and Mexico. It would \r\nalso include Brazil and Argentina, which are important \r\nneighbours, along with Ecuador. Together with them, \r\nwe are tackling, in a harmonious and coordinated \r\nmanner, the challenges of development in the twenty-\r\nfirst century.\r\nPeru has a firm commitment to defending and \r\ndefinitively strengthening representative democracy, \r\nhuman rights and the rule of law. That commitment \r\nwas clearly enshrined in the democratic Charter of \r\nthe Organization of American States. In that context, \r\nfundamental freedoms, the right to participate freely \r\nin political life and the separation of, and respect for, \r\nthe balance of powers are the cornerstones for the \r\ngovernability of our region and can ensure a future with \r\nhope.\r\nWe also respect the principle of non-intervention \r\nin the internal affairs of other States, something that \r\nwas established and introduced by the Latin American \r\ncountries as a norm of international law a century ago. \r\nHowever, respect for that principle cannot, and should \r\nnot, go against defence interests and the promotion \r\nof democracy and human rights, which consitute an \r\nirrevovable heritage for future generations.\r\nIn that context, it is imperative to mention our \r\nconcern regarding the critical political, economic \r\nand social situation that our friends in Venezuela are \r\ncurrently experiencing. Full-f ledged democracy requires \r\nabsolute respect for human rights and fundamental \r\nfreedoms, as well as due process. It also requires fully \r\nguaranteeing respect for the separation and balance of \r\npowers. The situation in Venezuela has been impacted \r\nby extreme violence, social and political confrontation \r\nand severe shortages of food and medicine. In order to \r\naddress that multifaceted crisis, we call in solidarity \r\nfor an internal political dialogue to begin as soon as \r\npossible, without conditions or restrictions and within \r\na context of full respect for the Constitution. Peru is \r\nready and willing to undertake all the necessary efforts \r\nthat might assist our Venezuelan friends in bringing \r\nabout a solution to their problems. We will work with \r\nthe countries of the Pacific Alliance in that endeavour, \r\nespecially with Venezuela’s neighbouring country of \r\nColombia, where we shall be in a few days to witness \r\nthe signing of the peace agreement with the Fuerzas \r\nArmadas Revolucionarias de Colombia.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to convey to the General \r\nAssembly that the Government that I lead in Peru is an \r\nadvocate of modernization, compatible with the efforts \r\npromoted by the United Nations system, in a global, \r\ninterdependent context, which has, however, unfortunately \r\nbeen affected by a series of grave conflicts that have been \r\nmentioned here today and throughout all of our debates.\r\nVarious parts of the world are experiencing a crisis \r\nof confidence, setbacks in globalization, populist and \r\nprotectionist temptations and an almost unprecedented wave \r\nof refugees, as the King of Jordan mentioned a moment ago. \r\nOur aim in South America and Latin America is to create a \r\nbridge of stability and cooperation between the Pacific and \r\nthe Atlantic that seeks to promote the gradual restoration of \r\npeace and prosperity in the western hemisphere.\r\nFinally, I wish to congratulate the Secretary-General on \r\nhis decade of service to the international community in such \r\nan important role.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Peru for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Pedro Pablo Kuczynski Godard, President \r\nof the Republic of Peru, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n44/56 16-29296\r\nAddress by Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President \r\nof the Republic of Turkey\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Turkey.\r\nMr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, President of the \r\nRepublic of Turkey, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Recep Tayyip \r\nErdoğan, President of the Republic of Turkey, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Erdoğan (spoke in Turkish, \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): I greet the \r\nGeneral Assembly on behalf of myself, my country and \r\nmy nation with the utmost respect. I hope the seventy-\r\nfirst session of the General Assembly will succeed in its \r\npurposes and will lead to favourable results for all countries \r\nand nations.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson on assuming the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-first session, and I \r\nthank His Excellency Mr. Mogens Lykketoft for his work \r\nduring his presidency during the previous session, while \r\nwishing him luck in his future endeavours.\r\nI would also like to thank His Excellency Mr. Ban \r\nKi-moon for his valuable contributions as he ends his 10-\r\nyear tenure as Secretary-General, during which he served in \r\na time of global challenges.\r\nWithin the first quarter of the twenty-first century, \r\nhumankind has reached a peak in achievements in science, \r\ntechnology, economic development and health. However, \r\nsuch brilliance has also a very dark and disgraceful side. In \r\nSyria, in Iraq and in many countries suffering in the grip \r\nof terrorism and war, hundreds of thousands of women and \r\nchildren, the young and the elderly, are being killed. Refugees \r\nfleeing death, tyranny and oppression are, unfortunately, also \r\nfacing degrading treatment in many European cities.\r\nTerrorist organizations, such as Da’esh and the Al-Nusra \r\nFront and the Democratic Union Party and Kurdish People’s \r\nProtection Units, continue their attacks and actions in the \r\nregion. There is also great potential for the disputes in the \r\nCaucasus region to unfold into a full-fledged conflict. Many \r\nproblems, from Yemen to Ukraine, are of particular urgency, \r\nwhile peoples in countries throughout the world struggle \r\nwith hunger, epidemics, poverty and illiteracy.\r\nThat is the disgraceful side of our world, damaging \r\nhuman dignity and disturbing the human conscience. What \r\nis even more distressing is that many of those crises and \r\nproblems could easily be resolved. Peace, prosperity and \r\nsecurity for future generations greatly depend on the \r\nsteps and measures that we take today. Now is the \r\nmoment to show leadership with a sense of responsibility \r\nin addressing the problems before us decisively.\r\nToday, terrorist organizations are able to employ a \r\nvariety of  methods. On the night of 15 July, we in Turkey \r\nsuffered a malicious coup attempt initiated by the \r\nFethullah terrorist organization, also know as Fethull. \r\nThat terrorist organization murdered 241 citizens and \r\ninjured 2,194 people. Our Parliament building, the \r\npresidential complex and many security organizations \r\nand law-enforcement units were bombed by the \r\nterrorist organization, using F-16 fighter jets. Tanks \r\nrolled through the streets and over people. Helicopters \r\nand military vehicles opened fire on civilians. The coup \r\nattempt was successfully repelled by our nation, which \r\nheroically preserved its democracy, Government, \r\nfreedoms and future and the constitutional order.\r\nI therefore take pride in my nation’s people, which \r\ndefeated that heinous coup attempt at the risk of \r\ntheir lives. For a period of 29 days the people never \r\nabandoned the city squares of Turkey, remaining on call \r\nto protect our democracy. They threw their bodies in \r\nthe way of tanks so as to repel the coup attempt. They \r\ntook a very noble stand. If I am standing here before \r\nthe Assembly today, it is because of our nation’s brave \r\nand noble reaction. It should never be forgotten that \r\nthe coup attempt in Turkey was aimed at democracy \r\nthroughout the world as well. Our nation taught a \r\nhistorical lesson to those intending to carry out coup \r\nattempts and became a source of inspiration for all \r\nnations committed to protecting democracy.\r\nThe new generation of terrorist organizations poses \r\na security threat, not only for Turkey but also for all 170 \r\ncountries around the world in which such organizations \r\nexist. In other words, today the majority of the countries \r\nrepresented here in the General Assembly are currently \r\nunder the threat of such clandestine structures. The \r\nterrorist organizations work on the premise of a \r\ndeep-rooted psychological heresy aimed at subduing \r\nthe whole world far beyond the borders of Turkey. \r\nThe members are deviant in their actions. The basic \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 45/56\r\nstrategy of the terrorist organizations is to infiltrate \r\nState institutions, influencing society and dominating \r\neconomic resources under the disguise of education, \r\ndialogue, tolerance, non-governmental organizations \r\nand the best of intentions.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I would like to call on all our \r\nfriends to take the necessary measures against the \r\nFethullahist terrorist organization in their own countries \r\nin order to protect the future of their own people and \r\ntheir well-being. Based on our experience, it is evident \r\nthat, if you do not fight against the Fethullahist terrorist \r\norganization now, tomorrow may be too late. I would \r\nalso like to take this opportunity to say that attributions \r\nsuch as “Turkish” or “Turkey” and all other similar \r\nlabels used by that terrorist organization and the \r\npersons associated with it have no relation with Turkey.\r\nThe humanitarian crisis in Syria has reached its \r\nsixth year. To date, 600,000 people have reportedly \r\nlost their lives, and, because of the war, 12 million \r\npeople have had to leave their country, 5 million of \r\nwhom have taken refuge in other countries. There \r\nare now 2.7 million such people in our country. They \r\nwere forced to leave their homes behind and have been \r\nwelcomed in Turkey. We have never asked why they \r\nended up in Turkey. Our doors are wide open. We have \r\nnot shut our doors in their faces, because they were \r\nf leeing barrel bombs and fighter jets. For those people, \r\nwe have had to assume our responsibilities and do what \r\nwas expected of us.\r\nWhile the West and the rest of the world might not \r\ndo so, we will continue to welcome them, because we \r\nare human beings. In the face of such an atrocity, we \r\nare obliged to keep our doors open to all those f leeing \r\ntyranny and oppression. We have opened our doors \r\nand kept them open. And we will continue to open our \r\ndoors in the future. The international community has, \r\nunfortunately, remained indifferent to the suffering of \r\npeople in conflict zones. The numbers that we have \r\nmentioned correspond to human beings.\r\nThe Syrian people are in a state of exhaustion \r\nin the grip of proxy wars that have been shaped by a \r\ncruel Administration, merciless terrorist organizations \r\nand global and regional competition. In that process, \r\nunfortunately, the international community has failed \r\nto live up to its humanitarian values and its collective \r\nconscience.\r\nTo date, Turkey has spent approximately \r\n$25 billion on the refugees, including money directed \r\nto non-governmental organizations and municipalities. \r\nMembers might ask: what has Turkey received from \r\nthe rest of the world? From the United Nations, we \r\nhave received only $525 million in aid and nothing \r\nelse. Have we received anything from the European \r\nUnion (EU)? The EU made certain promises, which \r\nhave, unfortunately, not been kept. It has allocated \r\n$178 million to UNICEF. That is all. Turkey itself has not \r\ndirectly received any aid whatsoever in financial terms.\r\nSince the beginning of the conflict, we have claimed \r\nthat the problem was a common question for the rest \r\nof the world. We have been establishing close contacts \r\nin solidarity with influential international figures. The \r\nSyrians are our neighbours and brothers and sisters. We \r\ncould not remain silent in the face of such tragedy and \r\ncarnage. We have never remained silent and never will. \r\nCurrently, 2.7 million refugees are being housed in our \r\ncountry, along with 300,000 Iraqis. A total number of \r\n3 million refugees have never been subjected to any \r\nethnic or religious discrimination in Turkey. We have \r\nopened our arms wide.\r\nIn addition to the tent and container cities in which \r\nwe accommodate the refugees in Turkey, we will \r\ncontinue to provide all forms of support commensurate \r\nwith our capabilities. We expect the EU and all other \r\norganizations that have pledged financial support \r\nto rise to the occasion. We expect them to keep their \r\npromises. Similarly, we expect the United Nations to \r\nkeep its promises. I hope and pray that the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session will loudly convey \r\nthat message to the rest of the world, because the \r\ncontributions of the international community should \r\nnot be limited $512 million s. What is one to think?\r\nFrom this rostrum, I call upon the rest of the world, \r\nincluding my European friends who believe that the \r\nSyrian refugees represent a threat and clear danger to \r\nthem. Barbed wire and high walls will never provide \r\nthem with the safety, security or peace of mind that \r\nthey are seeking. That effort is in vain. The problems of \r\nthe Syrian refugees should be immediately solved once \r\nand for all. Otherwise, we will never be able to prevent \r\nthe irregular migration, social issues and security risks \r\nembedded within that problem. We must not lose any \r\nmore time in ending the conflict, the terrorism and the \r\nenvironment of persecution, which are the sources of \r\nthe problem in Syria. We must urgently implement a \r\npolitical settlement process.\r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n46/56 16-29296\r\nWe attach great importance to protecting Syria’s \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity. We have no claims \r\nwhatsoever on Syrian territory. Syria belongs to the \r\nSyrian people. No one should ever have any plans \r\nwhatsoever with regard to the territory of Syria.\r\nStarting with our support for the Syrian opposition, \r\nwhat is known as Operation Euphrates Shield was \r\nlaunched, which is critical to re-establishing stability, \r\npeace and prosperity in a region of despair. It became \r\nclear that, with the launching of that operation, the \r\npriority of the terrorist organization Kurdish Workers \r\nParty, or of the Kurdish Democratic Party, is in not \r\nfighting against Da’esh. The operation — or offensive, \r\nas some prefer to call it — has also boosted the \r\nself-confidence of the moderate Syrian opposition \r\nforces. Furthermore, that development has provided \r\nencouragement to the local forces in Iraq that are eager \r\nto cleanse Mosul of the terror sowed by Da’esh.\r\nAs those who are present here are probably aware, \r\nfor a long time I have appealed for the establishment of \r\na safe zone along our border with Syria, which at more \r\nthan 900 kilometres is the longest border with Syria. \r\nAlong that border, Turkey has been continuously under \r\nthreat. We have been extremely patient. However, on \r\n24 August, in the city of Gaziantep, next to the Syrian \r\nborder, a wedding party was attacked by a 14-year-old \r\nsuicide bomber, a boy sent there by Da’esh terrorists. \r\nThe blast killed 56 people and injured more than 100. \r\nWe were patient until that critical moment. That was \r\nthe precise time when we said, enough is enough.\r\nAlong with the moderate opposition, we initiated the \r\noffensive. Primarily in Jarabulus, we have eliminated \r\nDa’esh and extended operations all the way to Al-Rai, \r\nwhere Da’esh was repelled. The local inhabitants of \r\nJarabulus were resettled, as were those from Al-Rai. \r\nFrom A’zaz to the Euphrates, the entire region was \r\nsaved from becoming a belt of terrorism. Instead, it was \r\nconverted into a belt of peace. The operation we are \r\nconducting today has the eventual goal of protecting \r\nthat safe zone and ensuring that it is in fact safe.\r\nThe people of Jarabulus were saved from the grip \r\nof the terrorists and are confident in returning to their \r\nhomes. The electrical and water infrastructure will \r\nbe made operational immediately. The Turkish Red \r\nCrescent, Turkish humanitarian aid organizations and \r\nall of the other non-governmental organizations have \r\nmobilized to meet the needs of the local inhabitants. \r\nAll of the civil facilities needed by the local inhabitants \r\nwill be constructed in the near future. In order to make \r\nthat possible, the areas officially designated as safe \r\nzones should also be declared as no-fly zones. We must \r\nmaintain a firm stand so as to ensure that a no-fly zone \r\nwill be established for the protection and security of the \r\nregion’s inhabitants.\r\nIt is unfortunate that the ceasefire, a process that \r\nhas received enormous investment, has failed. As is \r\nclear, a ceasefire is no longer possible. Yesterday, a \r\nUnited Nations convoy was attacked by the regime’s \r\nforces, resulting in the death of one person and many \r\nothers injured.\r\nThe Syrian regime has not allowed aid deliveries \r\nsupervised by the United Nations to reach the people of \r\nAleppo, who are in dire need. They are also attacking \r\nUnited Nations convoys. The regime is condemning \r\npeople to famine and suffering, in order to encourage \r\nthem to surrender or to die. The United Nations and the \r\nSecurity Council should no longer tolerate the regime’s \r\npolicies.\r\nIn Iraq it is clear that it will not be easy to establish \r\na political system to effectively protect its ethnic \r\nand sectarian diversity, which makes up the greatest \r\nunderlying strength of the country. Within that context, \r\nthe Mosul operation should be conducted by taking into \r\nconsideration the sensitivities of the people of the region. \r\nOtherwise, a new humanitarian crisis will emerge, \r\nleading to the influx of yet another 1 million people \r\nseeking refuge in other countries. We cannot leave the \r\nIraqi people alone at this critical juncture, when they \r\nneed the support of the international community now \r\nmore than ever.\r\nAllowing the Palestinian people to live in an \r\nindependent Palestine, with East Jerusalem as its \r\ncapital, based on the two-State solution, is an obligation \r\nof the international community to Palestinian children, \r\nif nothing else. Israel, especially, should respect \r\nthe sanctity of the Temple Mount and put an end to \r\nviolations of its status.\r\nWe will try to benefit from our normalized relations \r\nwith Israel to facilitate the peace process and resolve \r\nthe economic and humanitarian challenges faced by our \r\nPalestinian brothers and sisters through every possible \r\neffort. In that vein, we will continue our efforts to \r\ndeliver humanitarian assistance to the Gaza Strip.\r\nThat brings me to a very important point. The World \r\nHumanitarian Summit was held in May, in Turkey, for \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 47/56\r\nthe first time in history. We consider that Summit to \r\nhave provided an important opportunity to explore new \r\nways of more effective crisis intervention around the \r\nworld. In that connection, I would like to be clear in \r\nmy remarks. With respect to providing support to the \r\nleast developed countries around the world, Turkey, the \r\nUnited Kingdom and the United States rank among the \r\ntop three donors. But in the ratio comparing the amount \r\nof humanitarian aid to gross domestic product, Turkey \r\nis ranked number one in the world.\r\nWe are the country housing the most significant \r\nnumber of refugees around the world, and we are doing \r\neverything within our ability to stop irregular migration. \r\nUpon Turkey’s initiative, the subject of Syrian refugees \r\nwas addressed by the General Assembly last year for \r\nthe first time. Similarly, migration and terrorism were \r\nincorporated into the Group of 20 agenda, thanks \r\nto Turkey’s efforts. We are cooperating with the \r\nEuropean Union on the refugee crisis to the greatest \r\nextent possible.\r\nBased on the goal of preventing deaths in the \r\nAegean Sea, we have succeeded in reducing the \r\nirregular migration number to 50 people per day; \r\nwhereas, in October 2015, that number had reached \r\n7,000 per day. That shows that Turkey has successfully \r\nfulfilled its commitments under the framework of the \r\nrefugee agreement with the EU. However, we regret \r\nthat the promises made by the EU in the context of \r\nthe agreement of 18 March have been forgotten, while \r\nongoing false pretexts prevail and excuses are all that \r\nwe hear.\r\nThe Security Council must be reformed to improve \r\nthe effectiveness of peacekeeping and peacebuilding. \r\nWe fully appreciate Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon’s \r\nprogress in that respect. Furthermore, it is obvious \r\nthat, unless the Security Council, as the main organ \r\nresponsible for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, is reformed, such efforts will be in vain \r\nand the task will remain unfulfilled.\r\nThat is why we say that the world is greater than the \r\nfive permanent members. We have been reminding the \r\ninternational community of that fact over and over again \r\nwith every chance we get. The Security Council was \r\nestablished in the aftermath of the Second World War. \r\nOne cannot preserve the same structure of the Council \r\nunder the circumstances of modern times. One cannot \r\ncondemn the fate of the rest of the world to depend \r\non what the five permanent members in the Security \r\nCouncil say. There are five permanent seat-holders and \r\n10 non-permanent seat-holders in the Security Council. \r\nThat is not a proper Security Council. A Council that \r\ndoes not represent the entire world can never serve to \r\nre-establish peace and justice around the world. That is \r\nsomething that we need to revisit over and over again. \r\nCan everyone think about that — three European \r\ncountries, one country in Asia and one country, the \r\nUnited States of America, of course — five countries \r\nas the permanent seat-holders? What about the rest of \r\nthe world? What about the other countries around the \r\nworld? They have remained on the sidelines. We ignore \r\nthem.\r\nInstead, why not have 20 countries as permanent \r\nseat-holders in the Security Council, under a rotational \r\nsystem? In that system, each country would, deservedly, \r\nbe represented on the Security Council every year \r\nor every two years. That is the only way to establish \r\nfairness and justice. The representative nature of the \r\nSecurity Council should be established so that the \r\norgan will be much more effective, more just.\r\nIn order for that to be possible, the General \r\nAssembly has to reach complete consensus. Please do \r\nnot even consider remaining silent, or else we cannot \r\nachieve anything. We cannot succeed in our policies. \r\nWe have to engage in spying, so to say. We have to \r\nbe strong. We have to stand on our two feet, and talk \r\nabout the truth and nothing but the truth. We have to \r\nstand behind the truth. We are the politicians. Only in \r\nthat way can the world attain the level of justice that it \r\nyearns for. This is the only way to achieve democracy.\r\nIslamophobia is an alternate name for racism \r\nand discrimination. We see it prevailing in countries \r\nwith a large Muslim population. About a decade ago, \r\nalong with the then Prime Minister of Spain, we \r\nco-chaired the initiative of the United Nations Alliance \r\nof Civilizations project that aimed to find permanent \r\nsolutions to such dangerous movements that threaten \r\nour prosperity around the world. Similarly, we are also \r\nglad that interest in the Mediation for Peace Initiative \r\nthat we pioneered along with Finland in 2010 under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations has increased.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nwhich we have jointly developed, includes ambitious \r\nand transformative goals for us all. Official development \r\nassistance makes up the most important resource \r\nfor supporting development efforts, notably for the \r\nleast developed countries (LDCs). Turkey’s official \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n48/56 16-29296\r\ndevelopment assistance reached $3.9 billion in 2015. As I \r\nhave previously mentioned, the 0.54 per cent of our gross \r\ndomestic product, which is the ratio of humanitarian \r\naid that we provide, is beyond the Organization for \r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development average and \r\nhelps us approach the United Nations target, which is \r\n0.7 per cent. Turkey has surpassed its commitment to \r\nprovide $200 million annually to LDCs in 2011, and \r\nhas delivered more than $1.5 billion to LDCs in a mere \r\nfive-year period.\r\nBefore concluding my remarks, I hope and pray \r\nthat the seventy-first session of the General Assembly \r\nwill be the beginning of a new age to alleviate the pain \r\nand suffering of people around the world, and that it \r\nwill help us change our world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Turkey for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Excellency Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Turkey, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Josaia Voreqe \r\nBainimarama, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Fiji\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by His Excellency Mr. Josaia Voreqe \r\nBainimarama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji.\r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Fiji, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Fiji, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Bainimarama (Fiji): This is a special moment \r\nfor Fiji as you, Sir, assume the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session — the first Fijian \r\nand the first Pacific Islander to attain this high Office at \r\nthe United Nations. Your nation is honoured and proud. \r\nOn behalf of every Fijian, I offer you, Mr. President, my \r\nwarmest congratulations and wish you every success as \r\nyou guide our deliberations over the next 12 months.\r\nI want to thank those nations that supported Fiji’s \r\nbid for the presidency, including our neighbours and \r\nfriends among the Pacific small island developing \r\nStates. I also thank Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark \r\nfor his leadership during the seventieth session.\r\nFiji fully supports the agenda that you, Sir, have \r\noutlined for the coming session, which seeks to \r\npersuade the world to begin implementing the 2030 \r\nSustainable Development Goals that the 193 Member \r\nStates adopted last year. As you rightly stated, Sir, when \r\nyou took your oath of office last week, the seventy-\r\nfirst session must, for integrity’s sake, be the year that \r\nwe witness the wheels turning. We have collectively \r\npledged to mobilize the global community to end all \r\nforms of poverty, fight inequality and tackle climate \r\nchange. And we have pledged that, as we do so, we will \r\nleave no one behind, wherever they live on the planet. \r\nThat is our promise to the 7.5 billion people across the \r\nworld, whose interests we represent. It is a promise \r\nthat must be kept — a “universal push to transform our \r\nworld”, as the theme of this session puts it.\r\nA centrepiece of the seventy-first session and one \r\nof our most critical priorities is the high-level United \r\nNations Conference to Support the Implementation of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 14, which is to be held \r\nin New York next June on the theme “Conserve and \r\nsustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for \r\nsustainable development”. Fiji is proud to be co-hosting \r\nthat gathering with Sweden, and I ask everyone to give \r\nthat initiative their full support. The world must act \r\nquickly and decisively to reverse the environmental \r\ndegradation of our oceans and seas, and the reckless \r\nand irresponsible use of those precious resources.\r\nFor a small island developing State such as Fiji, \r\nthat is as pressing as the need to address the challenges \r\nof climate change and deal with the extreme weather \r\nevents and rising seas that pose such a threat to our way \r\nof life in the small island developing States and other \r\nvulnerable parts of the world. Many millions of people \r\nin maritime and coastal communities the world over are \r\nlooking to us for decisive action to address the growing \r\ncrisis of population, pollution, overfishing and the loss \r\nof marine habitats.We must not fail them.\r\nFiji also comes to the seventy-first session with a \r\nplea to all nations that have yet to do so to ratify the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change. We are proud \r\nto have been the first nation in the world to ratify the \r\nAgreement and launch the ratification instruments. \r\nBut we also come with the message that Paris must \r\nbe merely the first step. We are alarmed by scientific \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 49/56\r\npredictions that the 2°C cap on global warming over \r\npre-industrial levels agreed to in Paris is not enough to \r\nsave us.\r\nSeven months ago, the Fijian people were given \r\na terrifying glimpse into the future that the experts \r\nsay awaits us when we were struck by the biggest \r\ntropical cyclone ever to make landfall in the southern \r\nhemisphere, Cyclone Winston. Packing winds of more \r\nthan 300 kilometres an hour, it killed 44 of our people \r\nand left many thousands homeless. Mercifully, it \r\nspared our main tourism areas — our principal source \r\nof income — so our wider community and our wider \r\neconomy remained intact. But if this is what awaits \r\nus as global warming triggers weather events that are \r\nmore frequent and more extreme, then God help us.\r\nIn common with other small island developing \r\nStates, we face a nightmare scenario in which a single \r\nevent scoring a direct hit could wipe out our economy, \r\nset us back for decades and make it impossible for us to \r\nmeet the Sustainable Development Goals. Our message \r\nfrom the Pacific therefore is this: the 2°C cap is not \r\nenough. We need the world to go one better and embrace \r\nthe 1.5°C cap that we, members of the Pacific Islands \r\nDevelopment Forum, called for in the Suva Declaration \r\non Sustainable Human Development in the Pacific.\r\nWe also need deeper cuts in carbon emissions and \r\nmore decisive global action than what we are currently \r\nwitnessing. But as a first step, I appeal to all Member \r\nStates to ratify the Paris Agreement and to turn \r\naway from what I have termed “the coalition of the \r\nselfish” — those countries that would see vulnerable \r\nnations battered and submerged rather than alter their \r\npampered, carbon-driven lifestyles.\r\nI am proud to report that Fiji is heeding the \r\nPresident’s call to implement the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. First and foremost, we have \r\nplaced sustainable development at the core of our \r\nnational agenda. The Green Growth Framework for Fiji, \r\nwhich I launched in 2015, is a blueprint for the future \r\ndirection of our nation. It has been incorporated into \r\nour new five-year and 20-year national development \r\nplans that we will be unveiling in the coming months. \r\nThese plans stipulate that no development whatsoever \r\nin Fiji will be permitted unless it can be conclusively \r\ndemonstrated to be sustainable. We regard the \r\npreservation of our natural environment on land and at \r\nsea as our number-one priority. We are willing to make \r\nsacrifices to fulfil our solemn duty to the Fijian people \r\nto preserve their surroundings.\r\nArticle 40, paragraph 1, of our Constitution gives \r\nevery Fijian the right to\r\n“a clean and healthy environment, which includes \r\nthe right to have the natural world protected for the \r\nbenefit of present and future generations”.\r\nI make a solemn pledge to my own people and to the \r\nwider global community that, while my Government \r\nremains in office, Fiji will never be among the ranks \r\nof those nations that have compromised their futures \r\nfor short-term financial gain. We intend to raise our \r\nliving standards by other means, especially by making \r\nthings that other people want to buy and by providing \r\nservices they want to access. We are taking the Fijian-\r\nmade brand of quality products and services to the \r\nfour corners of the Earth and managing our economy \r\nresponsibly in accordance with international best \r\npractices, with a particular emphasis on infrastructure \r\ndevelopment, service delivery and providing for the \r\nless fortunate.\r\nOf prime importance is our education revolution, \r\nby which we are equipping Fijian young people with \r\nthe knowledge and skills to have satisfying, sustainable \r\nlivelihoods and contribute to our nation’s progress. \r\nWe are providing free schooling for the first time and \r\nhave established our first tertiary loan scheme and \r\nmore scholarships for gifted students in order to open \r\nup a gateway of unprecedented opportunity to our \r\nuniversities and a new network of technical colleges. \r\nWe have set our sights higher than ever before to \r\nbecome a smarter, more dynamic country at the hub \r\nof the Pacific, the crossroads of our region, and to \r\nevolve into a modern nation State that is a beacon to \r\nour neighbours and respected around the world.\r\nI am pleased to report that we have made a strong \r\nstart as a nation on the long but determined journey to \r\nachieve that goal. Not only are our people being given \r\nmore opportunity than at any time in our history, not \r\nonly are we creating a more equitable society, which \r\nincludes targeted assistance for the vulnerable and the \r\ncountry’s first pension scheme, but Fiji is also currently \r\nexperiencing a record period of economic growth, with \r\nseven straight years of expansion.\r\nEven in the wake of Cyclone Winston, we expect to \r\nsee growth of nearly 3 per cent this year. Our message \r\nto the world is simple: Fiji is open for business. Fiji \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n50/56 16-29296\r\nhas attractive incentives for investment and some \r\nof the most favourable corporate and personal tax \r\nrates in the Pacific region. We have state-of-the-art \r\ncommunications and an educated, English-speaking \r\nwork force. We are investing in new roads, airports and \r\nother infrastructure and have dramatically improved \r\nthe efficiency of our ports. We also have our pristine \r\nenvironment, spectacular islands, coastlines and \r\nwaters. In addition, our standard of hospitality has \r\nmade the Fijian people famous the world over.\r\nWe market ourselves to the world as a holiday \r\ndestination with the slogan “Fiji — where happiness \r\nfinds you”. Whatever the challenges of Cyclone \r\nWinston, I can confidently say that the Fijian people \r\nhave never been happier. The joy that erupted when our \r\nworld-champion rugby sevens team won the gold medal \r\nat the Rio Olympics was shared by every Fijian. It has \r\nbrought us together in celebration and seen us more \r\nunified in recent weeks than at any other time in our \r\nhistory. It has also inspired us to imagine what else our \r\nsmall nation can do if we put our minds to it.\r\nAs many in the Assembly are aware, we have had \r\nconsiderable challenges through the years in forging \r\na common identity and producing an equal and just \r\nsociety for every citizen, but I am here to say that those \r\ndays are over. As Fiji approaches its first half-century \r\nas an independent nation in 2020, we are finally one \r\nnation, one people, with a great sense of national \r\noptimism and a great deal to look forward to.\r\nTo reflect our new-found confidence, we are also \r\nin the process of re-evaluating our relationships with \r\nthe rest of the world. Last week, I assumed the position \r\nof Foreign Minister as well as Prime Minister, and I \r\nintend to steadily reform this Ministry and to refine \r\ncertain aspects of our foreign policy to give it a new \r\ndirection and a renewed sense of purpose.\r\nFirst and foremost, we are going to place trade at the \r\ncentre of our foreign-policy effort, with the promotion \r\nof the impressive collection of quality products and \r\nservices under the Fijian-made brand. Some of these \r\nproducts and services are already making a global \r\nimpact, but we believe we can do a lot more — whether \r\nit is our water, our cosmetics, foodstuffs and other \r\nmanufactured goods, the more efficient marketing of \r\nFiji as a prime holiday destination, or by spreading the \r\nwings of our boutique national airline, Fiji Airways, \r\nf lying to other destinations in the Asia-Pacific region \r\nand beyond.\r\nWe intend to immediately boost the level of \r\ncollaboration between our Foreign Ministry and our \r\nMinistry of Industry, Trade and Tourism, which have \r\ntoo often operated in isolation. Our diplomats and trade \r\ncommissioners will be instructed to make it a priority \r\nto work more closely with Fijian exporters to promote \r\nthe Fijian-made brand, as well as to access goods and \r\nservices of international standards from new and old \r\ntrading partners that benefit Fijian consumers.\r\nMore broadly, we are rethinking some of our \r\nforeign policy positions and objectives. This includes \r\na re-evaluation of the central principle of Fijian foreign \r\npolicy for some years of being “friends to all and \r\nenemies to none”.\r\nOf course, we seek friendly relations with all nations \r\nand are certainly not in the business of making enemies. \r\nBut we intend, in future, to choose our friends in a more \r\ndiscerning manner and to align ourselves more closely \r\nwith those countries that share our underlying values \r\nand principles. These include, above all, adherence to \r\ninternational law and adherence to human rights and \r\nhuman dignity, along with other shared values such as \r\nmutual respect, respect for sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegrity, the resolving of disputes by peaceful means \r\nand non-interference in one another’s internal affairs.\r\nThis change of direction will not be sudden. It is \r\ncertainly not going to produce a dramatic change in \r\nthe international company that Fiji keeps. But we are \r\ndefinitely seeking closer relations with nations that \r\nshare our values and basic outlook, especially those \r\nnations that respect human life and the rights and \r\ndignity of their citizens, adhere to the principle of social \r\njustice, uphold the rule of law and insist on equality and \r\nrespect for all human beings, as we in Fiji do.\r\nAs part of our wider commitment to human rights, \r\nwe are seeking membership in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the two-year term that commences in 2018. \r\nWe would be the first Pacific nation to serve on the \r\nCouncil, and I ask all member States to support our bid.\r\nFiji will continue to play a disproportionate role \r\nin the international community in relation to its size, \r\nwhether it be our continuing commitment to United \r\nNations peacekeeping and sending our men and women \r\nin uniform to protect ordinary people in troubled parts \r\nof the world, or our lead role in drawing global attention \r\nto the urgent need for action on climate change.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 51/56\r\nIt is certainly a proud moment for me, as the leader \r\nof our small nation, to stand here before the nations \r\nof the world with you, Sir, behind me, as President of \r\nthe General Assembly. Congratulations again on your \r\nappointment. I thank you for bringing such honour \r\nto our nation. Every Fijian — indeed, the entire \r\ncommunity of nations — wishes you well as you preside \r\nover the deliberations of this seventy-first session and \r\nthe great issues of our time on which the future of the \r\nworld depends.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nFiji for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Fiji, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland.\r\nMrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHer Excellency Mrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of the \r\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nand inviting her to address the General Assembly.\r\nMrs. May (United Kingdom): It is a great honour \r\nfor me to address the General Assembly for the first \r\ntime and to do so as Prime Minister of a country that \r\nhas always been a proud and proactive member at the \r\nvery heart of the United Nations.\r\nThe United Nations was formed because leaders \r\nacross the world knew that they could deliver security \r\nfor their citizens at home only if they could cooperate \r\nas a community of nations to deliver security across the \r\nglobe. Some of the threats that we face together today \r\nare familiar to those founding leaders: war, political \r\ninstability, abuses of human rights and poverty. \r\nOthers are new: global terrorism, climate change and \r\nunprecedented mass movements of people.\r\nWe gather here today because we know that such \r\nchallenges do not respect the borders of our individual \r\nnations and that only by working together shall we \r\novercome them. As a new Prime Minister to the United \r\nKingdom, my pledge to the United Nations is simple. \r\nThe United Kingdom will be a confident, strong and \r\ndependable partner internationally, true to the universal \r\nvalues that we share together. We will continue to honour \r\nour commitment to spend 0.7 of our gross national \r\nincome on development, building on the achievements \r\nthat we have already made to reduce poverty, deal \r\nwith instability and increase prosperity the world over, \r\nand we will drive forward the implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nWe will continue to champion the rights of women \r\nand girls, making sure that all girls get the education \r\nthey deserve and tackling horrific abuses such as female \r\ngenital mutilation and the use of sexual violence in \r\nconflict. We will continue to be a steadfast permanent \r\nmember of the Security Council, meeting our NATO \r\ncommitment to spend 2 per cent of gross domestic \r\nproduct on defence and making a leading contribution \r\nto United Nations peacekeeping efforts, where we have \r\ndoubled our commitment, including new deployments \r\nto Somalia and South Sudan.\r\nWe will continue to stand up for the rules-based \r\ninternational system and for international law, and I join \r\nother leaders in condemning the outrageous bombing of \r\nthe aid convoy in Syria yesterday. We will continue to \r\nplay our part in the international effort against climate \r\nchange, and, in a demonstration of our commitment to \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, the United \r\nKingdom will start its domestic procedures to enable \r\nratification of the Paris Agreement and complete these \r\nbefore the end of the year. And we will continue to \r\nstrengthen our existing partnerships, from the United \r\nNations to the Commonwealth and to NATO, seeking \r\nto resolve conflict in countries across the world, from \r\nColombia and Cyprus to Somalia and Yemen.\r\nBut we must never forget that we stand here at \r\nthe United Nations as servants of the men and women \r\nthat we represent back at home. As we do so, we must \r\nrecognize that for too many of these men and women, \r\nthe increasing pace of globalization has left them \r\nfeeling left behind. The challenge for those of us in \r\nthis Hall is to ensure that our Governments and our \r\nglobal institutions such as the United Nations remain \r\nresponsive to the people we serve, and that we are \r\ncapable of adapting our institutions to the demands of \r\nthe twenty-first century and of ensuring that they do \r\nnot become irrelevant.\r\nSo when it comes the big security and human \r\nrights challenges of our time, we need this, our United \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n52/56 16-29296\r\nNations, to forge a bold new multilateralism, because, \r\nas we have seen even in the past week, no country is \r\nuntouched by the threat of global terrorism, and when \r\nextremists anywhere in the world can transmit their \r\npoisonous ideologies directly into the bedrooms of \r\npeople vulnerable to radicalization, we need not just \r\nwork together to prevent conflict and instability in \r\nnation States, but to act globally to disrupt the networks \r\nthat terrorist groups use to finance operations and \r\nrecruit to their ranks.\r\nWhen we see the mass displacement of people on a \r\nscale unprecedented in recent history, we must ensure \r\nthat we are implementing the policies that are fit for the \r\nchallenges we face today. And when criminal gangs do \r\nnot respect our national borders, trafficking our fellow \r\ncitizens into lives of slavery and servitude, we cannot \r\nlet those borders act as a barrier to bringing such \r\ncriminals to justice.\r\nIn each of these areas, it is the convening power of \r\nour United Nations that gives us a unique opportunity \r\nto respond. But we can do so only if we modernize and \r\nadapt to meet the challenges of the twenty-first century. \r\nAs a United Nations we have shown how we can \r\nwork together to reduce the threat of international \r\nterrorism by preventing conflict and instability from \r\ndeveloping. For example, as a permanent member of the \r\nSecurity Council, Britain has played a leading role in the \r\nfight against Al-Shabaab in Somalia. Since 2010, with \r\nhuge support from across the region and, critically, the \r\ncommitment of Somalis themselves, Al-Shabaab has \r\nbeen driven from all the major cities it used to control.\r\nIt is vital that as an international community we \r\ncontinue to support countries in the region that are \r\ncontributing thousands of troops, and that we continue \r\nto build the capacity of Somali security forces. That \r\nis why the United Kingdom is now going to increase \r\nfurther our security support, and we will be calling \r\non others to do the same, hosting an international \r\nconference on Somalia in 2017, to maintain this vital \r\nmomentum. Missions like this must remain central to \r\nthe work of the United Nations, but on their own they \r\nare not enough, because the terrorist threats we face \r\ntoday do not come from one country but rather exist \r\nin a different space. The global networks they exploit \r\nrequire a different kind of global response.\r\nThese organizations are using our own modern \r\nbanking networks against us. We therefore need to look \r\nat our regulations and information-sharing and use our \r\ntechnological capabilities to get ahead of them. They \r\nare targeting our airlines, exploiting the fact that no one \r\ncountry can keep its citizens safe when they are f lying \r\nbetween multiple jurisdictions. That is why this week \r\nthe United Nations will vote on a United Kingdom-\r\nled draft resolution on aviation security so that every \r\ncountry implements the standards we need to ensure \r\nthat no country is the weak link.\r\nThey are exploiting the Internet and social media \r\nto spread an ideology that is recruiting people to their \r\ncause all over the world. We therefore need to tackle \r\nthis ideology head-on. That is why the United Kingdom \r\nhas championed the work that the Secretary-General \r\nhas led to develop a strategy for preventing violent \r\nextremism. Now, as an international community, we \r\nmust work together to adopt and implement the most \r\ncomprehensive national action plans to tackle both the \r\ncauses and the symptoms of all extremism. It is not \r\nenough merely to focus on violent extremism. We need \r\nto address the whole spectrum of extremism — violent \r\nextremism and non-violent extremism, Islamist and \r\nneo-Nazi, hate and fear in all their forms.\r\nJust as we need the United Nations to modernize \r\nto meet the challenges of terrorism in the twenty-first \r\ncentury, so too must we adapt if we are to fashion a \r\ntruly global response to the mass movements of people \r\nacross the world and its implications for security and \r\nhuman rights. The 1951 Convention relating to the \r\nStatus of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol must remain \r\nthe bedrock of our response, but the context in which \r\nthey must be applied has dramatically changed.\r\nAcross the world today, there are 65 million \r\npeople who have been forcibly displaced. That is \r\nthe equivalent of the entire population of the United \r\nKingdom. It is an unprecedented figure, one that has \r\nalmost doubled in a decade. And yet United Nations \r\nappeals are underfunded, host countries are not getting \r\nenough support and refugees are not getting the aid, \r\neducation and economic opportunities they need. We \r\nmust do more. As the second-largest bilateral provider \r\nof assistance, the United Kingdom remains fully \r\ncommitted to playing a leading role.\r\nIn the past five years, the United Kingdom has \r\ninvested over $9 billion in humanitarian assistance, \r\nsaving millions of lives every year. The London \r\nConference on Syria in February raised $12 billion \r\nin pledges, the largest amount ever raised in one day \r\nin response to a humanitarian crisis. And that money \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 53/56\r\nis being used to combine both urgent humanitarian \r\nassistance and vital economic development, benefiting \r\nboth refugees and the communities and countries \r\nhosting them. Clearly, we need to continue our efforts to \r\nbring an end to the conflict and the appalling slaughter \r\nin Syria and to get aid through to those who need it.\r\nWhile these efforts continue inside Syria, we \r\nalso need new efforts to support refugees and host \r\ncommunities in neighbouring countries, including \r\nthrough education and opportunities to work. These \r\nefforts are complemented by loans from international \r\nfinancial institutions and access to European markets. \r\nThrough our trading relationships and direct engagement \r\nwith businesses, we are mobilizing the private sector to \r\ncreate new jobs in the region for everyone. While there \r\nis more to be done, it is this approach to financing both \r\nhumanitarian support and economic development that I \r\nwill be championing when I announce a further United \r\nKingdom financial contribution at President Obama’s \r\nleaders’ summit on the global refugee crisis later today.\r\nBut in addition to refugees and displaced people \r\nf leeing conflict and persecution, we are also seeing \r\nan unprecedented movement of people in search of \r\ngreater economic opportunities through the same \r\nunmanaged channels. That affects all of us, and it is the \r\nresponsibility of us all to take action. We cannot ignore \r\nthe challenge or allow it to continue unmanaged. We \r\nneed to do better — for the countries people leave, for \r\nthe countries they move through, for the countries they \r\ntry to get to — and most of all, better for the migrants \r\nand refugees themselves.\r\nDespite the huge increase in international efforts, \r\nmore migrants have died attempting hazardous journeys \r\nacross borders this year than any other. I believe we \r\nhave to use the opportunity afforded by this session of \r\nthe General Assembly for an honest global debate to \r\naddress this global challenge.\r\nIn doing so, we should be clear that there is nothing \r\nwrong with the desire to migrate for a better life and \r\nthat controlled, legal, safe, economic migration brings \r\nbenefits to our economies. But countries have to be able \r\nto exercise control over their borders. The failure to do \r\nso erodes public confidence, fuels international crime, \r\ndamages economies and reduces the resources for those \r\nwho genuinely need protection and whose rights under \r\nthe Refugee Convention should always be fulfilled. I \r\nbelieve there are three fundamental principles that we \r\nnow need to establish at the heart of a new approach \r\nto managing migration that is in the interests of all \r\nthose involved.\r\nFirst of all, we must help ensure that refugees claim \r\nasylum in the first safe country they reach. The current \r\ntrend of onward movements, where refugees reach a \r\nsafe country but then press on with their journey, can \r\nonly benefit criminal gangs and expose refugees to \r\ngrave danger. We must therefore all do more to support \r\ncountries where the refugees first arrive, to provide the \r\nnecessary protection and assistance for refugees safely \r\nand swiftly and to help countries adapt to the huge \r\neconomic impact that refugees can have — including \r\non their existing population.\r\nAs we are seeing in Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, \r\nwhen the right assistance is provided, solutions that \r\nprovide sanctuary and opportunity to refugees, and \r\nopportunities for those hosting them, can be found. \r\nThis is also good for the refugees and the countries they \r\ncome from — because the closer they stay to home, the \r\neasier it will be for them to return and rebuild after \r\nthe conflict.\r\nSecondly, we need to improve the ways we \r\ndistinguish between refugees f leeing persecution and \r\neconomic migrants. I believe we must ensure that \r\nthe existing Convention and Protocol are properly \r\napplied to provide protection to refugees and reduce \r\nthe incentives for economic migrants to use illegal \r\nroutes. This in turn will help us target support for those \r\nrefugees who need it most and retain the support of our \r\npopulations for doing so.\r\nThirdly, we need a better overall approach to \r\nmanaging economic migration — one that recognizes \r\nthat all countries have the right to control their \r\nborders — and that we must all commit to accepting \r\nthe return of our own nationals when they have no \r\nright to remain elsewhere. By ensuring a managed \r\nand controlled international migration response while \r\nsimultaneously investing to tackle the underlying \r\ndrivers of displacement and migration at source, we can \r\nreject isolationism and xenophobia, thereby achieving \r\nbetter outcomes for all of our citizens, particularly for \r\nthe most vulnerable.\r\nFinally, as we gather here today to bring the \r\nfounding values of the United Nations to bear on some \r\nof the most pressing global problems, the likes of which \r\nwe have never seen before, we must also face up to \r\nthe fact that some of the worst human rights abuses, \r\nwhich we thought we had consigned to the history \r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n54/56 16-29296\r\nbooks, have re-emerged in new, pernicious forms. The \r\nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights, proclaimed by \r\nthe General Assembly, stated that all human beings are \r\nborn free and equal in dignity and rights, that no one \r\nshould be held in slavery and servitude and that slavery \r\nand the slave trade should be prohibited in all their \r\nforms. Yet, nearly 70 years on, we are presented with \r\na new form of slavery — modern slavery. Organized \r\ncrime groups, which are largely behind this modern \r\nslavery, lure, dupe and force innocent men, women and \r\nchildren into extreme forms of exploitation. Trafficked \r\nand sold across borders, victims are forced into living \r\nthe kind of inhumane existence that is almost too much \r\nfor our imagination.\r\nSuch criminals have global networks to help them \r\nmake money out of some of the world’s most vulnerable \r\npeople. Victims are held captive in squalid conditions, \r\nunder the constant shadow of violence and forced into \r\nsex and labour exploitation. If we are going to succeed \r\nin stamping out this abhorrent crime and bring the \r\nperpetrators to justice, we need to confront the reality \r\nof what were are dealing with. These organized-\r\ncrime groups work across borders and jurisdictions. \r\nThey often use the Internet and modern technology to \r\nrecruit, transport, control and exploit their victims, all \r\nthe while staying ahead of legal systems that are often \r\nconstrained by traditional geographical boundaries.\r\nWe must therefore take action. We must use our \r\ninternational law-enforcement networks to track down \r\nthese criminals wherever they are in the world and put \r\nthem behind bars, where they belong. We need to be \r\nsmarter and even more coordinated than the criminal \r\ngangs in our efforts to stop them. In the United \r\nKingdom, I am setting up the first-ever Government \r\ntask force for modern slavery, bringing together every \r\nrelevant department to coordinate and drive all our \r\nefforts in the battle against this cruel exploitation. \r\nWe are also using our aid budget to create a dedicated \r\nfund focused on high-risk countries where we know \r\nvictims are regularly trafficked to the United Kingdom. \r\nYesterday, I committed the first £5 million from that \r\nfund to work in Nigeria, to reduce the vulnerability of \r\npotential victims and step up the fight against those \r\nwho seek to profit from this crime.\r\nBut if we are to meet the Sustainable Development \r\nGoal to eradicate modern slavery, we need to go much \r\nfurther. Security relationships have developed between \r\nmany countries for dealing with such issues as counter-\r\nterrorism, cybersecurity, drug trafficking and wider \r\nintelligence-sharing, but we do not have a similar \r\nrelationship for the fight against modern slavery. We \r\ntherefore need our law-enforcement agencies to work \r\ntogether, with joint investigation teams working across \r\nmultiple countries. Victims will find freedom only if \r\nwe cultivate a radically new, global and coordinated \r\napproach to defeating this vile crime. Together, we \r\nmust work tirelessly to preserve the freedoms and \r\nvalues that have defined our United Nations from its \r\ninception. Together, we must work tirelessly to restore \r\nthese freedoms and values to the lives of the men, \r\nwomen and children who are exploited for profit and \r\nheld captive with little or no chance of escape.\r\nFrom the Declaration of St. James’s Palace and \r\nthe Atlantic Charter forged by Winston Churchill and \r\nPresident Roosevelt to the first meeting of the General \r\nAssembly in London in 1946, the United Kingdom \r\nhas always been an outward-looking, global partner at \r\nthe heart of international efforts to secure peace and \r\nprosperity for all our peoples. And that is how we will \r\nremain. For when the British people voted to leave the \r\nEuropean Union, they did not vote to turn inwards or \r\nwalk away from any of our partners in the world. Faced \r\nwith challenges like migration, a desire for greater \r\ncontrol of their country and a mounting sense that \r\nglobalization is leaving working people behind, they \r\ndemanded a politics that is more in touch with their \r\nconcerns and bold action to address them.\r\nBut that action must be more global, not less, because \r\nthe biggest threats to our prosperity and security do not \r\nrecognize or respect international borders. And if we \r\nfocus only on what we do at home, the job is barely \r\nhalf done. This is not the time to turn away from our \r\nUnited Nations. It is the time to turn towards it. Only \r\nwe, as members of this community of nations, can act \r\nto ensure that this great institution becomes as relevant \r\nfor our future as it has been in our past.\r\nLet us therefore come together, true to our founding \r\nvalues but responsive to the challenges of today, and let \r\nus work together to build a safer, more prosperous and \r\nmore humane world for generations to come.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland for the \r\nstatement she has just made.\r\nMrs. Theresa May, Prime Minister of the United \r\nKingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.8\r\n16-29296 55/56\r\nAddress by Mr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister \r\nof Canada\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nMr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of \r\nCanada, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Trudeau (Canada): It is an honour to be \r\npresent at the General Assembly today. It is wonderful \r\nto be here in the great city of New York. Once again this \r\nweek, New Yorkers showed us how to be resilient and \r\nresolute in the face of violent extremism. On behalf of \r\neveryone in this Hall, let me directly say to the people \r\nof New York that they are a model to the rest of the \r\nworld, and we thank them.\r\nExactly one year ago, Canada was in the middle \r\nof a long — 78 days on the road, and I can assure the \r\nAssembly that, in Canada, there are 78 days’ worth of \r\nroads — and closely fought election campaign. It is the \r\nresponsibility of a leader to spend time with the people \r\nthey are elected to serve. To get the real stories, it is \r\nimportant to go where people live: coffee shops and \r\nchurch basements, mosques and synagogues, farmers’ \r\nmarkets and public parks. It was in those places that I got \r\nthe best sense of what Canadians were thinking and how \r\nthey were doing and, through the politeness — because \r\nwe Canadians are always polite even when we are \r\ncomplaining — I learned a few things.\r\nI talked with people my age who were trying to be \r\nhopeful about their future but found it tough to make \r\nends meet, even when they were working full-time. I \r\nheard from young Canadians who were frustrated, who \r\ntold me that they could not get a job because they do \r\nnot have work experience but they cannot get work \r\nexperience because they do not have a job. I heard \r\nfrom women and girls who still face inequality in the \r\nworkplace and violence just because they are women, \r\neven in a progressive country like Canada.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI met parents who were working hard to give \r\ntheir children every opportunity to succeed but who \r\nfeared that their efforts would not be sufficient. I had \r\nthe chance share a meal with elderly retirees who had \r\ntoiled all their lives but who now have to go to food \r\nbanks. Over the past few years, I have had far too many \r\ndisturbing conversations with Canadians, but they \r\nmade something clear to me. Canadians still believe \r\nin progress, or, at least, that progress is possible. But \r\nthat optimism is mixed with great concern. It is clear \r\nthat Canadians are not the only ones who feel that way; \r\nthose feelings are present everywhere. That anxiety is \r\na fact of life.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWhen leaders are faced with citizens’ anxiety, we \r\nhave a choice to make. Do we exploit that anxiety or do \r\nwe allay it? Exploiting it is easy, but in order to allay \r\nit we need to be prepared to answer some very direct \r\nquestions. What will create the good, well-paying jobs \r\nthat people want and need and deserve? What will \r\nstrengthen and grow the middle class and help those \r\nworking hard to join it? What will build an economy \r\nthat works for everyone? What will help to make the \r\nworld a safer, more peaceful place?\r\nTo allay people’s anxiety, we need to create \r\neconomic growth that is broadly shared, because a fair \r\nand successful world is a peaceful one. We need to \r\nfocus on what brings us together, not on what divides \r\nus. For Canada, that means re-engaging in global affairs \r\nthrough institutions like the United Nations. It does not \r\nserve our interests — or the world’s — to pretend that \r\nwe are not deeply affected by what happens beyond \r\nour borders.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nEarlier this year, we helped negotiate the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. As part of our \r\ncommitment to implementing that Agreement, we \r\nannounced that Canada would invest $2.65 billion \r\nover five years to fund clean, low-carbon growth \r\nin developing countries. In order to help promote \r\npeace and security in areas affected by instability, \r\nwe reaffirmed our support for NATO and committed \r\nourselves to expanding Canada’s role in United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations. We hosted the fifth \r\nReplenishment Conference of the Global Fund to Fight \r\nAIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, where we increased \r\nour contribution by 20 per cent by giving more than \r\n$800 million to the Global Fund. We also encouraged \r\nour partners to increase their contributions, making it \r\npossible to raise $13 billion in support of ending AIDS, \r\ntuberculosis and malaria by 2030.\r\nA/71/PV.8 20/09/2016\r\n56/56 16-29296\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe have done all this — and will do much \r\nmore — because we believe we should confront anxiety \r\nwith a clear plan to deal with its root causes. We believe \r\nwe should bring people together around shared purposes \r\nsuch as the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. What \r\nis the alternative? Is it to exploit anxiety? Is it to turn it \r\ninto fear and blame? Is it to reject others because they \r\nlook or speak or pray differently than we do?\r\nIn Canada we got a very important thing right — not \r\nperfect, but right. In Canada, we see diversity as a \r\nsource of strength, not weakness. Our country is strong \r\nnot in spite of our differences, but because of them. \r\nWe must make no mistake: we have had many failures, \r\nfrom the internment of Ukrainian, Japanese and Italian \r\nCanadians during the World Wars, to our turning \r\naway of boats of Jewish and Punjabi refugees, to the \r\nshamefully continuing marginalization of indigenous \r\npeoples. What matters is that we learn from our mistakes \r\nand recommit ourselves to doing better. To that end, in \r\nrecent months, Canadians have opened their hearts and \r\ntheir arms to families f leeing the ongoing conflict in \r\nSyria, and from the moment they arrived, those 31,000 \r\nrefugees were welcomed — not as burdens, but as \r\nneighbours and friends — as new Canadians.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThat effort has brought Canadians together. In an \r\nalmost unprecedented fashion, the Government has \r\nworked with the business community, engaged citizens \r\nand civil society to help the newcomers adapt to their \r\nnew country. But our efforts will not truly be successful \r\nuntil those refugees have become established, full-\r\nf ledged members of the Canadian middle class. I want \r\nthe General Assembly to know that this objective is \r\nwithin our grasp — not because of what we have done, \r\nbut because of what they are themselves.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nRefugees are people with the same hopes and \r\ndreams as our own citizens. But while our people have \r\nfelt anxiety, Syrians faced catastrophe. We all know \r\nwhere Syria’s middle class is: they are living in refugee \r\ncamps in Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan. They are moving \r\nacross Europe, looking for a place to set down roots, \r\nto get their kids back into school, to find steady work \r\nand to become productive citizens. Refugee camps are \r\nteeming with Syria’s middle class: doctors and lawyers, \r\nteachers and entrepreneurs. They are well educated. \r\nThey work hard. They care about their families. They \r\nwant a better life — a safer and more secure future for \r\ntheir kids — as we all do. When I say, therefore, that I \r\nhope that the Syrian refugees we welcomed will soon \r\nbe able to join our middle class, I am confident that we \r\ncan make that happen, and we will do it by offering to \r\nthem the same things we offer to all our citizens — a \r\nreal and fair chance at success for everyone.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe are going to do all we can to build a strong \r\nmiddle class in Canada. We are going to invest in \r\neducation, because it gives the next generation the \r\ntools they need to contribute to the world economy and \r\nto succeed. We are going to invest in infrastructure \r\nbecause it creates good, well-paying jobs for the middle \r\nclass and helps to make our communities better places \r\nto live, work and invest. We are determined to build \r\nan economy that works for everyone — not just the \r\nwealthiest 1 per cent — so that every person benefits \r\nfrom economic growth. And we are going to refuse to \r\ngive in to the pressure of trading our cherished values \r\nfor easy votes. The world expects better from us, and \r\nwe expect better from ourselves.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn the end, there is a choice to be made. Strong, \r\ndiverse, resilient countries like Canada did not happen \r\nby accident, and they will not continue without effort. \r\nEvery single day, we need to choose hope over fear \r\nand diversity over division. Fear has never created a \r\nsingle job or fed a single family, and those who exploit \r\nit will never solve the problems that have created such \r\nanxiety. Our citizens, the nearly 7.5 billion people \r\nwe collectively serve, are better than the cynics and \r\npessimists think they are. People want their problems \r\nsolved, not exploited.\r\nCanada is a modest country. We know we cannot \r\nsolve these problems alone. We know we need to do this \r\nall together. We know it will be hard work. But we are \r\nCanadian, and we are here to help.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Canada for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.50 p.m.\r\n"
