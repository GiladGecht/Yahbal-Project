We very much hope that \r\nthis occasion will also be an opportunity to promote \r\ninternational collaboration. I would also like to express \r\nto Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon my most sincere \r\nthanks and appreciation for all of his great efforts for \r\nthe good of peoples around the world, as well as his \r\npromotion of the noble principles of the United Nations.\r\nThis session is taking place at the same time as the \r\ncelebration of independence of the State of Tunisia — 60 \r\nyears of independence as a modern country. It is 60 \r\nyears since we joined the United Nations, and this is \r\nan opportunity for us to reiterate how much Tunisia is \r\ncommitted to the purposes and principles behind the \r\ncreation of the Organization. We are fully prepared to \r\npursue assistance to the Organization so that the United \r\nNations can accomplish its noble goal of promoting \r\npeace, security, human rights and development \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nTunisia has had the unique experience of building \r\ndemocracy based on national accord so that we can \r\novercome differences in political opinion. That has \r\nallowed us to see major political accomplishments. \r\nWe have a new, modern Constitution. We have held \r\nlegislative and presidential elections that were witnessed \r\nby the entire world and declared transparent, free and \r\nfair. That has increased our confidence in ourselves \r\nand has made us more able to face up to the challenges \r\nwe face. It also led to the Tunisian National Dialogue \r\nQuartet winning the Nobel Peace Prize in 2015, which \r\nin turn enabled us to rectify our political trajectory to \r\novercome a political impasse.\r\nOur democratic experience in Tunisia has had \r\nmajor achievements, but we still need support. Given \r\nour fragile economy, we still need to strengthen our \r\ndemocracy. Five years have already gone by since \r\nthe 2011 Tunisian revolution, but we are still facing \r\nenormous challenges on the path towards achieving an \r\neconomic revival and improving living standards.\r\nWe have launched an ambitious initiative to meet \r\nthe expectations of the Tunisian people. We called for \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It \r\nled to the establishment of a Government of national \r\nunity, with robust participation by women, headed \r\nby a young leader. This reflects our determination to \r\nallow young people and women to assume important \r\nroles in this democratic experience. Tunisia left \r\nauthoritarianism behind in 2011, and our country is now \r\nunder the rule of law. We reiterate our determination to \r\nmove forward toward further democracy and freedom \r\nand to face up to all attempts to take us back in time.\r\nOf course, we are still a young country. We are \r\nfacing major economic and social challenges of an \r\nunprecented scale that jeopardize our path to the future, \r\nespecially given the regional context, particularly \r\nregional terrorism. That requires us to seek robust \r\nsupport from our partners so that we can overcome \r\nthe challenges and osbtacles and make headway on \r\ninternal development and create jobs for young people, \r\nparticularly those with qualifications.\r\nOn 29 and 30 November, Tunisia will host an \r\ninternational conference to support the economy and \r\nseek investment. Participants will include Heads of \r\nState and Government, representatives of international \r\norganizations, investment funds, civil society \r\nrepresentatives and representatives from the public and \r\nprivate sectors. It will be an opportunity for our brothers \r\nand friends to express their support and solidarity with \r\nTunisia, including their support for democracy in our \r\ncountry at this particularly critical point in time.\r\nThis year’s general debate is of particular \r\nimportance, especially following the adoption of the \r\nnew Sustainable Development Goals. It is of particular \r\nimportance because it is linked to the ambitious \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Tunisia \r\nalso adopted ambitious goals in establishing our own \r\ndevelopment plan. We will spare no effort to make the \r\n2030 Agenda a reality. \r\nWe call upon all partners to redouble their efforts \r\nto assist developing countries as they seek to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, including by \r\nproviding them with the support they are counting \r\non — especially for African countries, which are \r\nencountering many economic, social and environmental \r\ndifficulties. Those challenges require robust assistance \r\nfrom the international community so that African \r\ncommunities and countries can achieve development. \r\nWe need to make certain that we can do that in order \r\nto ensure that we have peace, stability and security and \r\nso that we can prevent conflicts and confront terrorism \r\nand extremism.\r\nToday, we renew our commitment to the African \r\nUnion Agenda 2063, which is the sum of our ambitions \r\nand our dedication. Given the close link between \r\npeace, security and development, we also renew our \r\ncommitment to strengthening our participation in \r\nUnited Nations peacekeeping operations and to taking \r\na more active role in capacity-building within the \r\nAfrican continent, including on military assistance.\r\nThe Arab world is seeing an increase in violence and \r\nconflict, which is a major source of concern. Violence, \r\nextremism and terrorism are spreading. We have seen \r\nthat lead to an increase in organized criminal activity, \r\nwhich is destabilizing every one of our countries \r\nwithout exception. The lack of stability in the Arab \r\nworld is just a part of the instability found throughout \r\nthe world. Therefore, we call upon everyone to find \r\nurgent political solutions to all the issues concerning the \r\nregion. First and foremost is the Palestinian question, \r\nwhich requires a fair, comprehensive solution that will \r\nprovide justice for the Palestinian people, bring an end \r\nto their suffering and allow them to obtain their historic \r\nlegitimate rights, in particular the establishment of \r\nan independent State, with Al-Quds as its capital, in \r\nconformity with related international decisions.\r\nWe are greatly concerned by the crisis in Libya, \r\nand our concerns will remain while instability reigns \r\nin that brotherly country, with all the implications that \r\nit can have for our security and our economy. We are \r\nfirmly committed to promoting reconciliation and \r\nagreement between the different parties in Libya so that \r\nthey can implement all phases of the Libyan Political \r\nAgreement, signed in 17 December 2015, under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations. We shall also continue \r\nour support for the Government of National Accord so \r\nthat it can assume its responsibilities and accomplish \r\nits role in re-establishing peace, stability and security \r\nand in combating terrorism and improving the living \r\nstandards of the Libyan people.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.9\r\n16-29302 3/18\r\nWe are following with concern the evolution of the \r\nsituations in Syria and Yemen. We are concerned about \r\nthe implications for security and the humanitarian \r\ndisaster resulting from those conflicts. We need a \r\npolitical solution to the situations in those two countries \r\nso that they can maintain their unity and territorial \r\nintegrity in order to ensure peace.\r\nMr. Onyeama (Nigeria), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nI stand here before the Assembly as we commemorate \r\nour independence and the sixtieth anniversary of our \r\naccession to the Organization. That reminds me of the \r\nfounder of modern Tunisia, Habib Bourguiba, who in \r\na speech confirmed that Tunisia, having recovered its \r\nindependence, declared its complete commitment to \r\nthe purposes and principles and the noble humanitarian \r\nvalues enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Today, as we begin a new chapter in our \r\nhistory — our ancient history — with many efforts to \r\nadvance democracy and the protection and promotion \r\nof human rights, we again affirm our determination \r\nto create a conducive environment for our citizens to \r\nbe able to live in dignity. As Tunisia grounds itself on \r\nthe efforts of the Tunisian people, with the support of \r\nour brothers and partners, we firmly believe that those \r\nefforts will be successful in contributing to security \r\nand peace in the region and worldwide.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Tunisia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Béji Caïd Essebsi, President of the Republic \r\nof Tunisia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Andrzej Duda, President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Poland.\r\nMr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Andrzej Duda, President \r\nof the Republic of Poland, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Duda (spoke in Polish; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): At the outset, I wish to \r\ncongratulate Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session, on his \r\nelection to his important position. I assure him of my \r\ncountry’s full support for his effort. At the same time, \r\nI wish to express my warm gratitude to Mr. Mogens \r\nLykketoft for his active presidency during the seventieth \r\nsession, during which I was honoured to take part for \r\nthe first time in my capacity as the President of the \r\nRepublic of Poland.\r\nSustainable development, the protection of \r\nhuman rights, and peace and security are the goals \r\npursued by the United Nations the achievement of \r\nwhich humankind deeply yearns. By adopting the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the \r\nnew Sustainable Development Goals last year, we \r\ndemonstrated that we are capable of acting together \r\nas an international community to achieve success, \r\nimplement the required tasks and, at the same time, \r\napproach new ambitious goals.\r\nI wish to address the three foundations of sustainable \r\ndevelopment, without which such development will \r\nnever be possible. It is my profound conviction that \r\nthese are the rules with which we should all identify if \r\nwe truly care about human happiness and the successful \r\nprogress of our nations. These three rules — the \r\nthree foundations of sustainable development — are \r\nresponsibility, solidarity and justice.\r\nResponsibility arises from our obligation to \r\nsafeguard the heritage that we are going to leave to \r\nour children and grandchildren: how we are going \r\nto be remembered by them and what they are going \r\nto write about us in history books. Responsibility is \r\nunderpinned by the conviction that history neither \r\nbegins nor ends here and now, but is a succession of \r\ngenerations, destinies and commitments.\r\nUnderstood in that way, responsibility nowadays \r\npertains in particular to social issues and the natural \r\nenvironment. Responsible development is development \r\nthat cares for the appropriate continuity to be preserved \r\nbetween generations — past, present and future. As in \r\nan Olympic relay, the smooth handing off of the baton is \r\nof key importance when one approaches the changeover \r\nbox.\r\nOn many occasions, as history has illustrated, \r\nthis historical continuity is interrupted. This is what \r\nhappens when people want to build too rapidly while \r\nA/71/PV.9 20/09/2016\r\n4/18 16-29302\r\ndestroying what our forebearers left behind, acting \r\nagainst their beliefs and their sense of rightness. When \r\norder gives in to chaos, social bonds are destroyed and \r\nfear and anxiety are aroused. When respect for tradition \r\nis absent and social engineering is used instead, \r\ndevelopment itself is not possible, let alone sustainable \r\ndevelopment.\r\nProgress that does not create but destroys is in \r\nfact regression. Family is the basic form of human \r\ncommunity that harmoniously links together succeeding \r\ngenerations. That is why solicitude for its durability \r\nand welfare is so crucially significant. Human rights \r\nare also family rights, and their attainment involves \r\nactive support for a multigenerational society. The \r\nmain instrument of the latter is a pro-family policy.\r\nI am proud to declare that the authorities of the \r\nRepublic of Poland are now carrying out an ambitious \r\nprogramme for improving the living conditions \r\nof children in Polish families. The groundwork \r\nunderpinning any development is the creation of \r\nappropriate conditions for the conception of new life.\r\nThe second challenge to sustainable development, \r\none which also calls for responsible policies, is care \r\nfor the natural environment. The implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development will \r\nnot be possible without fighting the degradation of \r\nnature — an effort to be undertaken with determination \r\nand consistency. We were reminded by Pope Francis, in \r\nhis encyclical Laudato si’, that the natural environment \r\nis a common good, belonging to all and meant for all.\r\nThe immensity of the challenges we face can be best \r\nillustrated by the fact that, at the recent International \r\nGeological Congress, scholars came to the conclusion \r\nthat we might describe a new geological era, termed \r\nAnthropocene. For the very first time in the history \r\nof the Earth, this era has not been determined by \r\ngeological but by human activity.\r\nWe realize what grave environmental consequences \r\nchanges in the natural environment produce. However, \r\ntheir social, economic and political ramifications are of \r\nequal importance. We can already ask ourselves whether \r\nwe are threatened by climate wars. This is precisely \r\nwhy only global actions undertaken in concord by all \r\nStates can bring about improvement in the condition of \r\nnature on our Earth.\r\nLast year in Paris we jointly demonstrated that we \r\nare capable of taking responsible decisions by adopting \r\na new climate agreement. The Republic of Poland \r\nwas an active participant in those negotiations. I wish \r\nto inform the Assembly that Poland has initiated the \r\nprocess of ratifying the Paris Agreement and the Doha \r\nAmendment. As President of the Republic of Poland, I \r\nattach great importance to its conclusion as quickly as \r\npossible, in line with the provisions of our Constitution.\r\nResponsibility for the natural environment, \r\nhowever, involves more than the mere prevention of \r\nclimate change. In line with the spirit of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, it also includes protecting \r\nthe water and the soil and fighting desertification. \r\nResponsible development requires a balanced approach, \r\nand therefore the natural environment should be viewed \r\nfrom the three perspectives of water, soil and air.\r\nIf it is to be sustainable, development must also take \r\ninto account the specificity of individual countries, \r\nparticularly their economic and employment structures.\r\nThe second pillar of sustainable development is \r\nsolidarity. This concept is particularly close to the hearts \r\nof the Polish people, who, led by the social movement \r\nbearing the same name, carried out a peaceful political \r\ntransformation a quarter of a century ago, rejecting the \r\nsystem founded on lies and enslavement. It is thanks to a \r\ncommunity that is sensitive to the misfortunes of others \r\nand respectful of all people, regardless of their origin or \r\nfinancial situation, that Polish solidarity is built upon \r\nsuch durable foundations. Today the Republic of Poland \r\nimplements the principle of solidarity on two planes: \r\ndomestic, and global.\r\nSolidarity is a development undertaken in the name \r\nof welfare for all social groups, not only those that are \r\nstrongest and most influential. Politics operating in the \r\nspirit of solidarity are politics that care for the weakest, \r\nnot the strongest. That is why it must rely on solidarity \r\nbetween employers and employees, and solidarity \r\nbetween more developed and less developed regions.\r\nFinally, the most fundamental solidarity is a \r\nsolidarity with those who have a sense of attainment, \r\nwith those who struggle to survive each and every day. \r\nOnly a development model founded on solidarity is \r\ncapable of producing a system where man, his needs \r\nand his aspirations are at its centre. This system must \r\nafford equal opportunities to all and allow us to tap into \r\nthe potential represented by those who have thus far \r\nbeen living in social exclusion.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.9\r\n16-29302 5/18\r\nIt is the concept of development founded on \r\nsolidarity that lies at the heart of the policies pursued \r\nby Poland’s present Government. In line with its tenets, \r\nimprovement of the quality of life of all citizens should \r\narise from the measures taken by the Government, and \r\nnot just macroeconomic indicators, which are often \r\ninsufficient in translating the advancement of the \r\nformer.\r\nWe do not want to be captives of economic dogmas; \r\nwe want solutions that allow the active participation of \r\nall social groups in development processes, giving them \r\nequal opportunity to benefit from economic growth. \r\nSuch solutions will produce the expected outcomes for \r\nrestraining exclusion and poverty and for levelling out \r\nsocial inequalities.\r\nOur policy is therefore consistent with the ambitious \r\nvision of the 2030 Agenda, which we jointly decided to \r\nimplement one year ago. I think the time has come to \r\nstart a global coalition of States for the solidarity-based \r\ndevelopment of societies. Solidarity in international \r\nrelations is, first and foremost, humanitarian and \r\ndevelopmental aid in all territories affected by military \r\nconflicts, economic crises or natural disasters.\r\nThe unprecedented scale of migration f lows in the \r\ncontemporary world — a phenomenon that we need to \r\nconfront directly — is a reminder of our great shared \r\nresponsibility: to begin actions to eliminate the real \r\nroots of poverty and to guarantee everyone the right to \r\nlive in his or her own home country.\r\nPoland has been watching with anxiety and concern \r\nthe growing number of people affected by conflicts, \r\nespecially in Syria and in Ukraine. Guided by our sense \r\nof solidarity, we have increased our humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment aid in the Middle East region and to the \r\nEast. \r\nIn our efforts to build peace and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we attach great importance to the \r\neducation of children and young people. That is why \r\nwe provide financial support to education projects in \r\nAfrica. My country has been, and will continue to be, an \r\nactive advocate for solidarity in the international arena.\r\nThe third pillar of sustainable development \r\nis justice. A just and equitable order, where the \r\nsustainable development model can be delivered, is \r\nfounded on respect for human rights and the law of \r\nnations. Individual freedom, the dignity of the human \r\nperson, the inviolability of human life and freedom of \r\nconscience and religion are all constituent parts of the \r\ncatalogue of inalienable human rights, which nowadays \r\ncall for particular protection. There are far too many \r\nplaces around the world where freedom is restricted by \r\nan oppressive political system, human dignity is violated \r\nand humankind’s most fundamental right — the right to \r\nlife — is encroached upon.\r\nOur fundamental objection is that there are so \r\nmany places in the world where people die because \r\nof the religion they profess, which is only a matter \r\nof conscience. We cannot stay silent in the face of \r\nsuffering Christians who are murdered in the name \r\nof religious fanaticism. The world must react to the \r\nphenomenon of religion-based genocide, which has \r\nbecome increasingly common.\r\nThat is why Poland welcomed with particular \r\nsatisfaction the fact that the protection of human \r\nrights has been given pride of place among the \r\npriorities of the new development agenda. Through \r\nour global agreement, we have jointly reaffirmed the \r\ninterdependence that exists between development and \r\nhuman rights and freedoms. Only through respect for \r\nall human rights — political, social, economic and \r\ncultural — can we fully harness human potential and \r\neventually implement the sustainable development \r\nmodel. Nevertheless, it must be remembered that all \r\nhuman rights are derived from the most fundamental \r\none, namely, the right to life.\r\nOur endeavours to make the world a better place \r\nto live will be futile, however, if we are incapable of \r\nsafeguarding the absolute primacy of international law \r\nin relations among States. Last year, in this very Hall, I \r\nspoke about the need to ground international relations \r\nin law (see A/70/PV.13). I went on to emphasize that \r\nall States were equally obligated to carry out their \r\ninternational commitments and that any actions \r\nviolating provisions of international law, among \r\nthem political sovereignty and territorial integrity in \r\nparticular, should be categorically denounced by the \r\nglobal community.\r\nToday, I wish to reiterate, in the clearest terms, that \r\nwe must abide by the rules, a principle best expressed \r\nby a Roman proverb, “ex injuria jus non oritur”, \r\nmeaning that law cannot arise from illegal acts. A \r\nnon-agressor has a right to the territory he occupies. \r\nWe reject the system by which it is the politics of force \r\nand aggression that decides a nation’s destiny. Peace \r\nand security are two fundamental preconditions for \r\nA/71/PV.9 20/09/2016\r\n6/18 16-29302\r\nsustainable development. The effectiveness of global \r\naction in that regard will depend on international \r\nsolidarity and concerted action among States.\r\nIn the meantime, any act of aggression that \r\nencroaches on international commitments undermines \r\nmutual trust among States and societies. It undermines \r\nthe order that was so strenuously built in the wake of \r\nthe Second World War. That is why it is so crucially \r\nimportant to ensure that the policy of force will always \r\nbe met with the decisive opposition of the international \r\ncommunity. For the law to be effective, any violation \r\nthereof must absolutely trigger the execution of \r\nsignificant countermeasures.\r\nI also wish to highlight the fact that the realization \r\nof the principle of justice in international relations is \r\nequally jeopardized if we decide to base it on the division \r\nof spheres of influence among super-Powers, for proxy \r\nwars would break out, respect for the subjective status \r\nof weaker States would disappear and the freedom and \r\nequality of States and nations would be encroached \r\nupon. Let us recall than any instance of peace made at \r\nthe expense of someone else’s freedom can hardly ever \r\nlast and is never equitable.\r\nThis year, my country has hosted two events that \r\nrestore faith in the power of international cooperation \r\namong States and nations. The North Atlantic Treaty \r\nOrganization Summit in July testified to NATO’s \r\nunity in the effort to build peace and freedom in the \r\ntrans-Atlantic space. It was an expression of the \r\nfailed responsibility of NATO countries that led to an \r\nagreement resulting in Europe’s heightened security. \r\nThe outcomes of the Warsaw Summit are an expression \r\nof allied solidarity and respect for the independence \r\nof free nations, and hence the values that underpin \r\nequitable international order.\r\nSoon after the NATO Summit, in my hometown of \r\nKrakow, we celebrated International Youth Day, during \r\nwhich young people from all over the world met with \r\nPope Francis. Those days were a time of celebration, \r\na time of joy, friendship and love. The young people \r\nwho gathered in Poland taught us that the road to peace \r\nbegins with human solidarity, based on concern for \r\nothers regardless of origin or religion. \r\nResponsibility, solidarity and justice are the pillars \r\non which Poland would like to build an international \r\ncommunity for the sustainable development of free \r\nnations and equal States.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Poland for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrzej Duda, President of the Republic \r\nof Poland, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the \r\nRepublic of South Africa\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa.\r\n Mr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Jacob Zuma, President \r\nof the Republic of South Africa, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Zuma: I wish to congratulate the \r\nPresident on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. I assure him of \r\nSouth Africa’s continued support in the implementation \r\nof his priorities and responsibilities throughout his term.\r\nWe also commend Mr. Mogens Lykketoft of Denmark \r\nfor his able stewardship of the General Assembly during \r\nits historic seventieth session.\r\nThe year 2016 is an important year in South Africa, \r\nas we mark two significant historic anniversaries in our \r\ncountry. We recently marked the sixtieth anniversary \r\nof the 1956 Women’s March against discriminatory and \r\nracist laws, and the fortieth anniversary of the youth \r\nuprising against apartheid of 16 June 1976. Those two \r\nevents marked significant turning points in the history \r\nof our struggle against apartheid minority rule in our \r\ncountry. The Women’s March brought into sharp focus \r\nthe gender dimension of the struggle and the equal \r\nrole of women in the fight against white domination, \r\noppression and injustice. Equally, the youth uprising 40 \r\nyears ago highlighted and cemented the role of young \r\npeople in fighting for liberation and a better society.\r\nWe are reminded of those two milestones as we \r\naddress the theme of this debate: “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”. Last year, world leaders marked the seventieth \r\nanniversary of the United Nations by adopting the 2030 \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.9\r\n16-29302 7/18\r\nAgenda, that is, the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs). We committed ourselves to an ambitious and \r\ntransformative global development programme that \r\nseeks to address the triple challenge of this century, \r\nwhich is poverty, unemployment and inequality. \r\nTo a great extent, the Millennium Development \r\nGoals (MDGs) played a critical role in galvanizing \r\nGovernments and communities all over the world \r\nto put in place programmes and policies aimed at \r\npoverty eradication and addressing socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment, particularly in Africa.\r\nIt is a well-known reality that our continent, \r\nparticularly sub-Saharan Africa, did not achieve the \r\ntargets that were set in the MDGs. It was for that reason \r\nthat we insisted that the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals should continue the unfinished business of the \r\nMDGs. We therefore have an interest in ensuring the \r\nfull implementation of the SDGs as we take forward the \r\nagenda of promoting Africa’s sustainable development.\r\nWe have made significant strides in the past couple \r\nof decades in reversing the impact of underdevelopment \r\nand the legacies of colonialism and apartheid in Africa. \r\nIf the African continent is to develop faster, we need to \r\naddress certain constraints. That includes inadequate \r\ninfrastructure; high dependency on primary products; \r\nhigh exposure to commodity-price volatility; limited \r\ninvestment in research and development, science, \r\ninnovation and technology; and low private-sector \r\ninvestment, as well as the need to continue improving \r\nskills. To respond to some of those constraints, the \r\ncontinent has embarked upon a number of initiatives, \r\nincluding the New Partnership for Africa’s Development, \r\nthe Presidential Infrastructure Championing Initiative, \r\nthe African Mining Vision and the Programme for \r\nInfrastructure Development in Africa.\r\nIn South Africa, we have put in place a national \r\ndevelopment plan that is aligned with both Agenda 2063 \r\nof the African Union and the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals. At the core of our development plan is a focus \r\non poverty eradication and raising the standard of \r\nliving of our people. Our national development plan \r\nis also in line with the drive for the industrialization \r\nof Africa. That will contribute to eradicating poverty \r\nand reducing inequality and unemployment, and will \r\nalso contribute to global growth and prosperity. It is \r\ntherefore imperative that Africa and the least developed \r\ncountries, which were left behind in previous \r\nindustrialisation processes, not be excluded from the \r\nfourth, or new, industrial revolution.\r\nThe successful implementation of Africa’s \r\ndevelopment plans depends on the availability of \r\nresources. We are therefore seriously concerned about \r\nthe loss of the continent’s resources through illicit \r\nfinancial f lows. The joint African Union-United \r\nNations Economic Commission for Africa High-level \r\nPanel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa estimates \r\nthat illicit f lows from Africa could amount to as much \r\nas $50 billion per year. Illicit financial f lows deprive \r\ndeveloping countries of economic resources that are \r\nmuch needed to uplift their economies in order to \r\nprovide infrastructure and basic services, such as \r\neducation and health care. We urge the world at large \r\nto treat this problem with the seriousness and urgency \r\nthat it deserves.\r\nWe also need to close the gap that has painfully \r\ndivided people between rich and the poor and divided \r\ncountries between big and small economies. Global \r\ninequality and economic exclusion have become a \r\nserious threat to global peace and stability. Inclusive \r\ngrowth is therefore a peace, security and prosperity \r\nimperative. However, inclusive growth will remain a \r\ndistant dream if powerful nations continue to put their \r\nnational interests ahead of the global collective interest.\r\nThe African continent remains committed, \r\nthrough the African Union and its Peace and Security \r\nArchitecture, to resolving the remaining conflicts. We \r\nhave committed ourselves to silencing the guns by \r\n2020. We appeal to the Security Council in particular to \r\nsupport African peace operations so that we can achieve \r\nthat noble goal. The situations in Libya, South Sudan \r\nand the Central African Republic remain a continental \r\npriority. We strongly urge the Security Council to better \r\nalign and coordinate with the African Union in efforts \r\nto bring about peace in those sister countries and on the \r\ncontinent at large.\r\nBeyond the continent, we remain concerned about \r\nthreats of terrorism. Fifteen years after the 11 September \r\nterrorist attacks on the United States, international \r\nterrorism remains a challenge that no single country \r\nor region has been able to deal with successfully. We \r\nhave witnessed the rise of the Islamic State in Iraq and \r\nthe Levant and are horrified by its brutal and senseless \r\nkillings. The conflicts in both Libya and Syria have \r\nprovided fertile ground for the terrorists to carry out \r\ntheir unjustified terrorist activities.\r\nIn less than five years, the conflict in Syria has led \r\nto chaos in that country, with a devastating effect on \r\nA/71/PV.9 20/09/2016\r\n8/18 16-29302\r\nthe stability of the region. The deadlock in the Security \r\nCouncil on the Syrian question exposes the inherent \r\nstructural dysfunction of the 1945 post-Second World \r\nWar consensus. We must therefore ask ourselves if the \r\nUnited Nations, and particularly the Security Council \r\nas currently configured, can fulfil its mandate in \r\naddressing the challenges of the twenty-first century.\r\nThe Security Council is supposed to act in our \r\ncollective interests, without being bogged down by the \r\nnarrow domestic interests of a few States. It is imperative \r\nand urgent that the United Nations be reformed, and in \r\nparticular the Council. South Africa has been calling, \r\nand will continue to call, for fundamental reform of the \r\nSecurity Council in order to ensure the representation \r\nof Africa. One billion people cannot continue to be \r\ndenied a voice in this manner.\r\nThe lack of progress in finding a durable solution \r\nto the Palestinian question and the Sahrawi Arab \r\nDemocratic Republic’s struggle for self-determination \r\nremains of major concern for us. It is important that \r\nthe United Nations carry out its historic mission to \r\nensure that the two longest-standing decolonization \r\nand occupation issues are resolved once and for all, in \r\nfulfilment of the objectives set forth under the Charter \r\nof the United Nations.\r\nThe signing of the Paris Agreement last year \r\nmarked a historic moment in humankind’s resolve to \r\nminimize the impact of climate change and address \r\nthe human contribution to it. I would like to take \r\nthis opportunity to commend Secretary-General Ban \r\nKi-moon for the extraordinary leadership that he \r\nprovided since the fifteenth Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange, held in Copenhagen. He was unwavering in \r\nhis commitment to seeing a legally binding agreement \r\nfinally agreed to by all. The adoption of the Durban \r\nPlatform for Enhanced Action, during the seventeenth \r\nConference of the Parties, was a historic milestone and \r\nmarked a turning point in the negotiation of a legally \r\nbinding instrument. It provided a clear road map with \r\ntargets and deadlines.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of \r\nSouth Africa, I would to take this opportunity to salute \r\nthe outgoing Secretary-General of the United Nations, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for the sterling and \r\noutstanding manner in which he steered the affairs of \r\nthe Organization in the past decade. We wish him well \r\nin his future endeavours.\r\nWe are pleased that for the first time in the history \r\nof the United Nations the General Assembly has been \r\nat the centre of the process of finding a new Secretary-\r\nGeneral. We believe in a balanced and equal role between \r\nthe two principal organs of the United Nations on the \r\nquestion of the selection of the Secretary-General. The \r\nGeneral Assembly, as the most representative organ, \r\nrepresenting all the aspirations of the peoples of the \r\nworld, should be central in determining the right man \r\nor woman to lead the United Nations into the future. \r\nThe General Assembly cannot be expected just to \r\nrubber-stamp decisions of the Security Council. South \r\nAfrica is particularly supportive of the proposal to limit \r\nthe term of office of the Secretary-General to a seven-\r\nyear non-renewable term in order to allow him or her \r\nto work without being concerned about reappointment.\r\nSouth Africa looks forward to working with the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly and other Member \r\nStates throughout this session.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof South Africa for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jacob Zuma, President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Africa, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Borut Pahor, President of the \r\nRepublic of Slovenia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia.\r\nMr. Borut Pahor, President of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Borut Pahor, President of \r\nthe Republic of Slovenia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Pahor: Today, we bear witness to a \r\ndigital transformation all over the globe. So far, it \r\nhas been reflected above all in the global economy. \r\nHowever, there is no doubt that, very soon, that \r\ntransformation will substantially affect every aspect of \r\nsocial life — at the local, regional, and international \r\nlevels. I was fascinated by the announcement of the \r\nUnited States Department of Labor that 65 per cent \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.9\r\n16-29302 9/18\r\nof today’s students will be employed in jobs that do \r\nnot exist at present. It is true that such forecasts are \r\nmore valid for the most developed countries, but the \r\nvery essence of the digital transformation is rapidly \r\nspreading across the globe. \r\nBe that as it may, such remarkable technological \r\nprogress should be welcomed. We are filled with hope \r\nthat, in this way, we can find solutions to unsolved \r\nproblems. However, like similar changes in the past, \r\ntoday’s fourth industrial revolution will bring about \r\nnew problems and deepen some of the old challenges \r\nthat humankind is facing.\r\nI will speak first about inequality. Yet the issue of \r\ninequality relates not only to the sense of social justice \r\nor injustice but increasingly to world peace. Today’s \r\nworld has not yet come to understand, let alone rid itself \r\nof, the traditional reasons for the use of force within \r\nand between countries. And there is already a new \r\nchallenge ahead of us, namely, how we should regulate \r\ntechnological progress so that it benefits everyone, \r\nand not just a privileged minority. The information \r\nrevolution has paved the way to a global awareness \r\nof social inequalities. I believe that that is one of the \r\nmain triggers of social conflicts, including in the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe question of legal and any other regulation of \r\nthe digital transformation is certainly a new issue on \r\nthe agenda. That also holds true for the most developed \r\ncountries in the international community. However, the \r\nglobalization of the digital transformation is occurring \r\nso swiftly that it will have to be actively addressed \r\nby the United Nations. We will encounter difficulties \r\nand obstacles at the beginning, but eventually historic \r\nnecessity will force us to pool our efforts.\r\nPooling our efforts in creating effective regulation \r\non climate change proves that we can be successful \r\nin our endeavours. It is quite possible that one of the \r\nelements of success was the fact that climate change \r\nis a major factor of global migration. And as long as \r\nmigration is not regulated, it will continue to cause \r\nthe world’s paramount security problem. In that sense, \r\nmigration is yet another catalyst for the international \r\ncommunity to find appropriate common solutions.\r\nIn any and all contexts, the peaceful resolution \r\nof conflicts is absolutely essential. With regard to its \r\nfundamental reason for existence, it seems that the \r\nUnited Nations is not effective enough. That should \r\nbe a further reminder that the Organization ought to \r\nadapt to the new circumstances and balance of powers. \r\nIf the United Nations system is not successful in coping \r\nwith international conflicts, it risks being sidelined. \r\nThe use of force as an extreme means of dispute \r\nresolution without the necessary endorsement by the \r\nUnited Nations — for example, in the fight against \r\nterrorism — risks bringing about the decline of the \r\npolitical and security architecture established after the \r\nSecond World War.\r\nThe next leader of the United Nations is therefore \r\nof crucial importance. My country, Slovenia, is proud \r\nto have presented Mr. Danilo Türk, our former Head \r\nof State and former Assistant Secretary-General for \r\nPolitical Affairs with a decades-long commitment to \r\nthe United Nations, as a candidate for that eminent \r\npost. I am firmly convinced that he is a strong and \r\ncredible candidate and that it is time that a Secretary-\r\nGeneral came from among the Group of Eastern \r\nEuropean States.\r\nI like to present my country as smart, green and \r\nof just the right size to be a reference country in many \r\ndifferent aspects, but Slovenia also stands for democracy, \r\nequality and the peaceful resolution of disputes, and it \r\nrespects international law and principles. We have built \r\nour community of nations on respect for international \r\nlaw and on the protection of individuals and their \r\nhuman rights. If we wish our societies to f lourish, such \r\nduties must never be far from our minds.\r\nMy country is also a strong supporter of effective \r\nmultilateralism and is among those countries that strive \r\nto bring the global community closer to universal respect \r\nfor human rights, promote respect for international law, \r\nstrengthen the rule of law, foster preventive diplomacy, \r\nparticularly in the field of mediation, protect peace and \r\nsecurity, promote gender equality, protect the elderly, \r\npreserve natural resources, implement sustainable \r\ndevelopment goals and ensure a decent life for all.\r\nSlovenia will promote these principles within the \r\nUnited Nations, including as a member of the Human \r\nRights Council and a candidate for its presidency in \r\n2018, as a current Chair of the Human Security Network \r\nand as a member of various informal groupings within \r\nthe United Nations, as well as within other regional \r\norganizations and groupings of which we are members.\r\nAfter the truly landmark previous session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, it is now time to start implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which, \r\ntogether with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \r\nA/71/PV.9 20/09/2016\r\n10/18 16-29302\r\nprovides a signpost for and a vision of a more sustainable \r\nfuture for our planet and prosperity for its people.\r\nWe will also continue our efforts to have May \r\n20 proclaimed World Bee Day. Our activities during \r\nthis session of the General Assembly will take place \r\nmainly within the context of the Food and Agriculture \r\nOrganization of the United Nations, and we expect to \r\npresent a resolution in New York during the Assembly’s \r\nseventy-second session. We believe that strengthening \r\nour common care for bees and other pollinators is \r\nneeded to ensure food security, biodiversity and \r\nsustainable development.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that it was a tremendous \r\nprivilege to work with the outgoing Secretary-General. \r\nI would like to pay tribute to him and to thank him for \r\nhis determined efforts to promote the United Nations, \r\nits values and its goals. We will remember him for his \r\ntireless endeavours to make the world a better place. Let \r\nus fervently hope that the next Secretary-General will \r\ndo the same, and even better, for the sake of humanity \r\nand of our children and grandchildren.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Borut Pahor, President of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of \r\nthe Arab Republic of Egypt\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Arab Republic \r\nof Egypt.\r\nMr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, \r\nPresident of the Arab Republic of Egypt, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Al Sisi (spoke in Arabic): Allow me at \r\nthe outset to congratulate President Peter Thomson \r\non having assumed the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session and to wish \r\nhim every success. I would also like to express my \r\ngratitude to Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session, for his efforts \r\nand contributions.\r\nThe current session of the General Assembly \r\ncomes in the wake of our launching a new phase in \r\nour efforts to achieve comprehensive sustainable \r\ndevelopment, in its environmental, economic and \r\nsocial dimensions, following our adoption of the 2030 \r\nSustainable Development Agenda and the Addis Ababa \r\nAction Agenda (resolution 69/313) on financing for \r\ndevelopment the previous year.\r\nThe aspirations of peoples, particularly in the \r\ndeveloping world, to a decent standard of living and \r\nongoing progress are without a doubt our primary \r\nresponsibility as leaders, entrusted to us by our peoples, \r\nin line with the principles of humanity that guide us \r\nall. However, the challenges that face developing \r\ncountries, coupled with their limited capacities, prevent \r\nthe full realization of the Goals set out in the Agenda. \r\nDeveloping countries are not afforded sufficient \r\nopportunity to achieve sustainable development; they \r\nrequire a conducive international environment that \r\nprovides them with a larger share of international trade, \r\nfinancing mechanisms and the transfer of technology, \r\nas well as investment f lows and debt settlement. They \r\nmust also have a national environment that is conducive \r\nto development.\r\nEgypt calls for support for the role of the State \r\nin order to ensure a balance between the different \r\ndimensions of sustainable development, particularly in \r\nrelation to the effectiveness of social security networks \r\nand advancing national ownership of development. \r\nEgypt also stresses the importance of harnessing \r\nthe global monetary system to establish a fair global \r\neconomic system that provides equal opportunities \r\nfor development and contributes to minimizing the \r\ngap between developed and developing countries. The \r\nUnited Nations is the ideal platform to address this \r\nissue. Accordingly, Egypt was among the first 22 States \r\nto present a voluntary review of its development plans \r\nlast July.\r\nLast year we reached an agreement based on the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change. As Coordinator of the Committee \r\nof African Heads of State and Government on Climate \r\nChange, I reaffirm Africa’s commitment to confronting \r\nclimate change, within the limits of its capabilities, and \r\nits aspiration to put into practice the implementation \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.9\r\n16-29302 11/18\r\nmechanisms of the agreement on the transfer of \r\ntechnology and sustainable financing. Egypt has \r\nestablished a track for the Renewable Energy Initiative \r\nand presented it in the context of its leadership of the \r\nCommittee of African Heads of State and Government \r\non Climate Change, in implementation of the relevant \r\nAfrican Union resolutions.\r\nEgypt wishes to highlight the importance of this \r\ninitiative in providing support to Africa. Efforts to \r\naddress climate change must take into consideration \r\nequity and the right to development, as well as \r\nadherence to the principles of international law, the most \r\nimportant of which is refraining from harm; enhancing \r\ncooperation; and the participation of different countries \r\nin prospective projects, in accordance with the rules that \r\ngovern international financial institutions, particularly \r\nthe World Bank.\r\nThe world has become a global village as a result of \r\nthe positive impact of the communications technology \r\nrevolution, as well as unimpeded capital f lows, \r\ninvestments and global trade. However, we continue to \r\nsee another facet of globalization, one that has led to a \r\nnumber of social and economic challenges. \r\nGlobalization has been linked to an increase in \r\npoverty, the expansion of the inequality gap and the \r\nundermining of the social contract. These factors \r\ncombined have exerted pressure on the institutional \r\ncohesion of affected countries. These challenges and \r\npressures constitute the greatest incentive for the \r\ninternational community to work diligently to provide \r\nState institutions in all countries with the best possible \r\nmeans of undertaking their responsibilities and meeting \r\nthe needs and aspirations of their peoples. \r\nAmid the challenges facing the international order, \r\nthe Egyptian people have succeeded in enforcing \r\ntheir will to achieve stability, to protect the State and \r\nits institutions and to safeguard their society from \r\nfragmentation and chaos. The Egyptian people approved \r\na new Constitution that enshrines the rights and freedoms \r\noutlined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, \r\nestablishes equality regardless of citizenship and \r\nconsolidates protection of vulnerable groups, paving \r\nthe way for women to occupy an unprecedented number \r\nof seats in the House of Representatives and expanding \r\nits youth representation. The House of Representatives \r\nis now actively exercising its legislative authority and \r\noversight responsibilities over the executive authorities.\r\nOn the economic front, Egypt is steadily moving \r\nforward in implementing an ambitious plan for \r\neconomic reform that takes into consideration social \r\ndimensions and the requisites of a decent livelihood for \r\nthe Egyptian people. Egypt is also implementing major \r\nnational projects with an aim of expanding its road \r\nnetwork and renewable energy production, as well as \r\nincreasing agricultural land.\r\nWhile the Middle East continues to suffer from \r\nbloody conflicts, Egypt has managed to preserve its \r\nstability in a highly unstable region, thanks to the solidity \r\nof its institutions and its people’s awareness of their \r\ngreat cultural heritage. The international community \r\nmust acknowledge and support that fact, to the benefit \r\nof the region and the whole world, so that Egypt may \r\ncontinue to act as an anchor of stability in the Middle \r\nEast, sparing no efforts in carrying out its natural role \r\nby working with regional and international parties to \r\nrestore security and stability in the Middle East.\r\nAt the forefront of the bloody conflicts plaguing the \r\nregion, the agonizing situation in Syria has now reached \r\nits sixth year, resulting in hundreds of thousands of \r\ndeaths and millions more internally displaced people \r\nand refugees, both within their homeland and in \r\nneighbouring countries. Among them are 500,000 \r\nSyrians whom Egypt has welcomed as brothers and \r\nsisters, providing them with health care, education and \r\nhousing. The bloodletting in Syria and the absence of \r\nany political prospects on the horizon are no longer \r\nacceptable.\r\nWhat is necessary is clear — an immediate and \r\ncomprehensive halt to all hostilities throughout Syria, \r\nthereby paving the way for a political solution that ends \r\nthe bloodshed and preserves the territorial integrity \r\nand security of Syria and its State institutions, as well \r\nas realizing the aspirations of Syrians and putting an \r\nend to the chaos that has served only to facilitate the \r\nproliferation of terrorism. In that regard, we welcome \r\nthe latest agreement on cessation of hostilities, which \r\nwas reached as a result of commendable efforts by \r\nRussia and the United States. We hope for swift and \r\nserious international action to resume negotiations as \r\nsoon as possible, in order to reach a comprehensive \r\nsettlement to the crisis.\r\nWithin the same context of our troubled region, \r\nthe Arab-Israeli conflict continues to be the core of \r\nregional instability in the Middle East, necessitating \r\njoint efforts by the countries of the region and \r\nA/71/PV.9 20/09/2016\r\n12/18 16-29302\r\nthe international community to reach a final and \r\ncomprehensive solution to the conflict. Egypt continues \r\nto pursue its best efforts to achieve peace in the region \r\nand end the Israeli occupation through negotiations and \r\nprogress in the peace process in order to reach a final \r\nsettlement as well as sustainable and just peace, on the \r\nbasis of a two-State solution. We therefore welcome \r\ncurrent efforts based on a genuine desire to improve the \r\nsituation in Palestinian territories, as the Palestinian \r\npeople continue to suffer from a state of affairs that \r\nmust be rectified. There should be a focus on ending the \r\noccupation and restoring the rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople through a peace agreement consistent with \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy — one that \r\nguarantees Palestinians’ right to their own State and \r\nachieves security for Israel by normalizing relations in \r\nthe region.\r\nEgypt reiterates that a hand for peace continues \r\nto be extended in the form of the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative. Egypt also stresses the need to work to take \r\nconstructive steps to end Israeli settlement-building \r\nand to initiate negotiations for a lasting resolution, \r\nwhile simultaneously halting all acts that bring harm to \r\nthe Arab heritage in Jerusalem. \r\nAllow me to deviate from my written \r\nstatement — here at this forum, which represents the \r\nvoice of the world — to address and appeal to Israeli \r\nleaders and the Israeli people to consider the need to find \r\na solution to this question. We have a real opportunity \r\nto begin a new chapter in the history of our region and \r\nto move towards peace. Egypt’s inspiring and unique \r\nexperience can in fact be replicated by solving the \r\nPalestinian problem and establishing a Palestinian \r\nState alongside the Israeli State, while preserving \r\npeace, security and prosperity for both Israelis and \r\nPalestinians.\r\nLibya is currently at a dire juncture and in deep \r\npolitical crisis, which has direct implications for \r\nEgyptian national security. Despite the progress \r\nachieved last year through the signing at Skhirat \r\nof the Libyan Political Agreement, there have been \r\ndifficulties in its implementation. Egypt is playing an \r\nactive role in bringing the Libyan parties together and \r\nsupporting the implementation of the Agreement as a \r\nmeans of regaining the unity of the Libyan State and \r\nits authority over its territory and allowing it to operate \r\nthrough its legitimate institutions, as represented by the \r\nPresidential Council, the National Unity Government, \r\nthe House of Representatives and the national army. \r\nEgypt is also hosting meetings of our Libyan \r\nbrothers to facilitate the implementation of the Skhirat \r\nAgreement, as well as the establishment of a national \r\nunity Government that represent all Libyans and its \r\nratification by the House of Representatives, so that the \r\ncountry can focus on its reconstruction. That in turn \r\nwould allow the Libyan army to focus on combating \r\nterrorism. In that regard, it is necessary to lift the arms \r\nembargo imposed on the army. There is no place for \r\nterrorism and militias in Libya. The time has come to \r\nrestore the institutions of the Libyan State.\r\nIn Yemen, Egypt is exerting every effort to support \r\nYemeni territorial integrity and security and the return \r\nof the legitimate Government. We support the efforts \r\nof the United Nations Special Envoy for Yemen, Ismail \r\nOuld Cheikh, and his plan to resolve the crisis, which \r\nhas been approved by the legitimate Government. We \r\nstress the importance of resuming negotiations and for \r\nall parties to declare their commitment to the Special \r\nEnvoy’s plan to reach a comprehensive settlement \r\nin Yemen in accordance with Security Council \r\nresolutions, in particular resolution 2216 (2015). Egypt \r\nwill continue to support efforts towards a solution \r\nand to provide humanitarian assistance to our Yemeni \r\nbrothers and sisters, in addition to our fundamental role \r\nin securing maritime navigation in Bab Al-Mandab and \r\nthe Red Sea.\r\nThe majority of these Arab crises are a reflection \r\nof a global state of conflict, and I must reiterate Egypt’s \r\nrejection of any foreign interference in Arab affairs. I \r\nwould like to affirm our commitment to the principle \r\nof good neighbourliness and to stress Egypt’s solidarity \r\nwith Arab States in facing foreign interventions, in the \r\nlight of the link between Arab security, including the \r\nsecurity of the Arab Gulf.\r\nBy the same token, Egypt shoulders its \r\nresponsibility towards the security and stability of \r\nAfrica. Egypt currently chairs the Peace and Security \r\nCouncil of the African Union. In that capacity, Egypt \r\nis focusing on enhancing cooperation between the \r\nAfrican Union and the United Nations in terms of \r\ngrowing transnational threats, including terrorism \r\nand organized crime. We aim to bring about a shift in \r\naddressing conflicts, on the basis of the principle of \r\nnational leadership and ownership, to ensure the success \r\nof peacebuilding efforts. Through its memberships in \r\nboth the African Union Peace and Security Council \r\nand the United Nations Security Council, Egypt has \r\nbeen keen to enhance coordination between the two \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.9\r\n16-29302 13/18\r\nbodies — something Egypt placed at the forefront of \r\nits priorities during its chairmanship of the Council.\r\nEgypt has sought to support the Peace and Security \r\nArchitecture in Africa, in particular by way of efforts \r\nto operationalize the African Standby Force. Egypt \r\nhas also increased its participation in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions in the region, having regained \r\nits place as one of the ten largest contributors.\r\nEgypt calls for the adoption of a comprehensive \r\ncounter-terrorism strategy through an approach that is \r\nnot limited to security aspects but includes ideological \r\nconsiderations as well. Egypt will host the counter-\r\nterrorism centre for the Community of Sahelo-Saharan \r\nStates.\r\nEgypt would also like to highlight the importance \r\nof assessing any rising sources of tension, taking into \r\nconsideration the phenomena of desertification and \r\nwater scarcity, and the developmental needs related to \r\nmanaging transnational boundaries in connection with \r\nwater resources.\r\nWith regard to situations in the African continent, \r\nEgypt stresses the need to provide the Somali \r\nGovernment with support in order to conclude \r\nelections. In Burundi, Egypt seeks to find solutions \r\nto the political crisis through the African Union Peace \r\nand Security Council and through the United Nations \r\nSecurity Council. We are working to address the crisis \r\nin the appropriate manner so as to defuse the political \r\nsituation and allow all the Burundian parties to \r\nintensify peaceful political dialogue, thereby averting \r\nthe use of violence.\r\nEgypt has sought to participate in the regional \r\nframework to address the crisis in South Sudan ever \r\nsince its inception, engaging with the parties to the \r\nconflict, as well as regional and international parties, to \r\nachieve peace. Through its current chairmanship of the \r\nAfrican Peace and Security Council, Egypt is seeking \r\nto increase the role of the Council in that regard, as well \r\nas to enhance cooperation with the joint monitoring and \r\nevaluation mechanism. Egypt calls for all parties to \r\nwork within the Transitional Government of National \r\nUnity of South Sudan, with the aim of restoring peace \r\nto Juba. \r\nRegarding the Republic of the Sudan. Egypt \r\ncommends the efforts carried out by the Sudanese \r\nGovernment, which have resulted in the signing of the \r\nroad map proposed by the African Union High-level \r\nImplementation Panel last April.\r\nThe phenomenon of terrorism and the animus \r\ntowards the right to life it represents have become \r\nan urgent threat to international peace and security. \r\nTerrorism constitutes a threat to the entity of the State \r\nin favour of extremist ideologies that utilize religion as \r\na veil from behind which to conduct monstrous acts and \r\nmenace the destinies of peoples. Fighting it requires \r\nintensive regional and international cooperation. Egypt \r\nhas always stressed that the effort to defeat terrorism \r\nwill never achieve its end unless we address the root \r\ncauses of the phenomenon, confront terrorist groups \r\nwith decisiveness and refute the extremist ideologies \r\nthat give birth to terrorism and its proponents.\r\nI call upon the international community to take all \r\npossible measures to prevent terrorism from exploiting \r\nadvances in information technology, which have \r\ncontributed to endowing the phenomena of terrorism \r\nand ideological extremism with dangerous new \r\ndimensions that have given them a global reach. It is \r\nessential to end the broadcasting of channels and the \r\nhosting of websites that incite violence and extremism.\r\nThe world is at a crossroads. Threats to international \r\npeace and security are no longer conventional but have \r\nrather evolved to constitute a threat to the very tenets \r\nof human civilization. In the same vein, the challenges \r\nthat we face — be they humanitarian, environmental, \r\neconomic, developmental or health-related — are \r\nno longer confined by international borders but have \r\nbecome global. In that regard, I would like to point out \r\nthat the first preambular paragraph to the Constitution \r\nof UNESCO states that “since wars begin in the minds \r\nof men, it is in the minds of men that the defences of \r\npeace must be constructed”.\r\nI assert before the Assembly that terrorism is the \r\ncancer of our age, spreading with it the call for extremism \r\nand violence in the minds of people. Accordingly, it is \r\nour duty to instil in those very same minds the principles \r\nof tolerance and coexistence. If culture is the reflection \r\nof the principles by which humankind lives, then we \r\nmust employ culture, technology and knowledge for the \r\nbenefit of the development of peace. \r\nThe United Nations has to give greater attention \r\nto addressing the cultural aspects of development and \r\npeacemaking and to eliminating destructive ideologies, \r\nincluding through access to knowledge, transfer of \r\ntechnology and confronting extremist ideologies. That \r\nmust be undertaken in partnership with UNESCO, an \r\norganization whose role has grown vastly in importance \r\nA/71/PV.9 20/09/2016\r\n14/18 16-29302\r\nin today’s world. Egypt recognizes the ever-increasing \r\nimportance of that role and the importance of taking \r\nthe utmost advantage of the organization with a view to \r\nachieving a better, safer and more understanding world \r\nin which there is room for all.\r\nIt high time for humankind to reclaim the \r\nessence of its humanity, while sharing knowledge and \r\ntechnology without monopolizing them and uniting in \r\nthe face of challenges. Just as it has always been an \r\neternal accumulation of civilizations, Egypt reaffirms \r\nbefore the General Assembly today its commitment \r\nto continuing to contribute to coexistence within the \r\ninternational family and striving for a more secure and \r\nprosperous world for our future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Abdel Fattah Al Sisi, President of the Arab \r\nRepublic of Egypt, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of \r\nthe Federal Republic of Nigeria\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Federal Republic \r\nof Nigeria.\r\nMr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, \r\nPresident of the of the Federal Republic of Nigeria, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Buhari: On behalf of the people and the \r\nGovernment of Nigeria, Sir, let me congratulate the \r\nPresident on his well-deserved election as the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-first session. I \r\nassure him of Nigeria’s support in steering the affairs \r\nof the General Assembly over the next 12 months. I \r\nalso take this opportunity to express my appreciation \r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Mogens Lykketoft, for the \r\nachievements recorded during his tenure.\r\nLast year, I presented my first address to the \r\nGeneral Assembly after my assumption of office as \r\nPresident of the Federal Republic of Nigeria (see A/70/\r\nPV.15). Indeed, it was a remarkable year, which not only \r\ncelebrated the gains of the Millennium Development \r\nGoals but also witnessed the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. These landmark \r\nachievements by the global community will without \r\nany doubt build a more prosperous, all-inclusive \r\nworld. We must work together to liberate humankind \r\nfrom poverty, save our planet from the devastation of \r\nclimate change and rid the world of terrorism for a more \r\npeaceful and prosperous future.\r\nWe must remain committed to taking bold steps \r\nto transform our world. The Sustainable Development \r\nGoals underscore the imperative for our collective will \r\ntowards finding enduring and sustainable solutions to \r\naddressing global disparities. It is in the light of our \r\nappreciation of the enormity of the task before us that I \r\nwelcome the theme of the Assembly: “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform \r\nour world”.\r\nNigeria, as a developing country, has been \r\nadversely affected by the global economic downturn. \r\nWe are, however, undeterred and have embarked upon \r\na wide range of reforms in our efforts to diversify our \r\neconomy and shift emphasis to mining, agriculture, \r\nindustrialization, infrastructure development and the \r\ncreation of an enabling environment for foreign direct \r\ninvestment. Our strategic objective is to stimulate the \r\neconomy, restore growth and accelerate recovery. In \r\ndoing that, we are taking measures to reduce the cost of \r\ngovernance and increase expenditure on infrastructure \r\nand ensure environmental best practices.\r\nFighting corruption remains a cardinal pillar of \r\nour Administration. Corruption freezes development, \r\nthereby undermining the achievement of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. I am pleased that \r\nour efforts in fighting corruption are yielding positive \r\nresults, including significant recoveries of stolen \r\nassets. The recovered funds are being channelled \r\ntowards the development of critical infrastructure and \r\nthe implementation of social inclusion programmes \r\nfor our people. We are also strengthening the capacity \r\nof Government entities to institutionalize reforms to \r\nensure transparency and good governance.\r\nThe Anti-Corruption Summit held in London in \r\nMay this year served as further assurance of the global \r\ncommunity’s commitment to fight corruption through \r\nthe proposed practical steps to address the challenges, \r\nincluding actions to hold perpetrators to justice within \r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.9\r\n16-29302 15/18\r\nthe law. Nigeria supports the development of an \r\ninternational legal framework to enforce anti-corruption \r\nmeasures and strengthen existing international \r\ninstitutions to effectively deal with corrupt practices.\r\nNigeria calls on Member States that are yet to \r\nsign up to the United Nations Convention against \r\nCorruption to do so. Nigeria will continue to advocate \r\nfor the facilitation of the recovery of illicit financial \r\nassets. Indeed, the speedy and unconditional return of \r\nstolen public assets should be the focus of the follow-up \r\nanti-corruption conference, to be hosted by the United \r\nStates and United Kingdom next year in Washington, \r\nD.C.\r\nFurthermore, Nigeria remains committed to the \r\nExtractive Industries Transparency Initiative, a global \r\ncoalition that promotes transparency and accountability \r\nin the management of revenues from the oil, gas and \r\nsolid minerals sectors. We voluntarily signed up to the \r\nInitiative because we are convinced that transparent \r\ngovernance is an imperative for resource-rich \r\ndeveloping countries like ours. Through the work \r\nthat our national chapter of the Extractive Industries \r\nTransparency Initiative has done over the years, it is \r\nclear that our faith is not misplaced. The Initiative has \r\nbeen empowering citizens with the critical information \r\nthey can use to hold Government and other players \r\nin the extractive industries to account, and make \r\nrecommendations that drive reforms in those strategic \r\nsectors of our national life.\r\nThe world took a giant step in Paris towards \r\naddressing the challenges of climate change. Nigeria is \r\nproud to have been part of the process leading to the \r\nadoption of the Paris Agreement in December 2015 \r\nat the twenty-first meeting of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change. That meeting marked a watershed \r\nin the global community’s commitment to address \r\nclimate change, and we will continue in our determined \r\nefforts to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions. At the \r\ncentre of Nigeria’s climate action is our determination \r\nto implement the strategies in our intended nationally \r\ndetermined contributions, which will foster a low-\r\ncarbon economy and sustainable growth in building \r\na climate-resilient society. We are creating public \r\nawareness through the integrated involvement of the \r\nprivate sector and civil society and by strengthening \r\nnational institutions and mechanisms.\r\nThe negative consequences of climate change \r\nhave manifested themselves in the drying up of our \r\nLake Chad. The means of livelihood of an estimated \r\n30 million inhabitants of the Lake Chad Basin — spread \r\nacross Cameroon, Chad, the Niger and Nigeria — are \r\nbeing severely threatened. The cost of replenishing \r\nthe lake has been put at $14 billion, under a five-year \r\nplan that should be accorded global attention. Nigeria \r\nalso supports the African Union initiative on the Great \r\nGreen Wall to halt desertification.\r\nIn furtherance of our commitment to environmental \r\nsustainability, Nigeria has launched the Clean Up \r\nOgoniland initiaitve in Nigeria’s Niger Delta, based \r\non the 2011 environmental assessment of the area \r\nby the United Nations Environment Programme. \r\nMultinational oil companies operating in the area \r\nwill be required to live up to their corporate social \r\nresponsibilities and contribute to the cleaning-up of \r\nthe environment, degraded as a result of their activities \r\nand operations. We call on development partners \r\nand multinationals to support our efforts through the \r\nOgoniland Restoration Fund.\r\nThe twenty-first century has thus far been marked \r\nby the rising insecurity unleashed by global terrorism \r\nand violent extremism, which constitute a real threat to \r\nthe international community. With the global increase \r\nin the spate of terrorist attacks, there is now, more than \r\never, international consensus and greater willingness \r\nto collaborate in combating the threat. Indeed, we are \r\nmeeting at the time when our hosts, the American \r\npeople, have just marked the fifteenth anniversary of the \r\ntragic and dastardly terrorist attacks on their soil. We \r\nin Nigeria, having been victims of terrorism ourselves, \r\nfully understand the impact of 9/11 on the American \r\npsyche and the families of the thousands of innocent \r\nvictims whose lives were lost that day. I therefore \r\nreiterate the sympathies of the Nigerian Government \r\nand the Nigerian people to the American people, along \r\nwith prayers for the families of the victims that they \r\nmay heal and find closure soon.\r\nWe hope that justice will be done for the families \r\nof victims of 9/11, as indeed to the victims of terror \r\neverywhere, in conformity with the norms of \r\ninternational justice. As we seek justice for terrorism \r\nvictims, the international community should avoid \r\nreacting in the heat of the deep emotions of the moment \r\nby taking unilateral measures, legal or otherwise, \r\nthat will have a negative and disruptive impact on the \r\ninternational community’s collective efforts to fight \r\nA/71/PV.9 20/09/2016\r\n16/18 16-29302\r\nterrorism. We should not be distracted in our collective \r\nresolve to beat back terrorism in all its forms. \r\nAs we confront terrorism, we must also commit \r\nto stopping the proliferation of small arms and light \r\nweapons, which nurtures its spread. To that end, Nigeria \r\nurges Member States that are yet to sign and ratify the \r\nArms Trade Treaty to do so without further delay.\r\nNigeria has made remarkable progress in its resolve \r\nto defeat Boko Haram, whose capacity to launch \r\norchestrated attacks as a formed group has been severely \r\ndegraded. In the past few months, their operations have \r\nbeen limited to sporadic use of improvised explosive \r\ndevices against soft targets.\r\nNigeria has continued to combat terrorism on the \r\nbasis of the established rules of engagement and in \r\nconformity with international best practices. I take \r\nthis opportunity to reaffirm Nigeria’s commitment to \r\nhuman rights norms and international humanitarian \r\nlaw in our efforts to counter terrorism and violent \r\nextremism. I also wish to restate the assurance that \r\nthe Federal Government of Nigeria is employing all its \r\njudicial tools to investigate and address reported cases \r\nof human rights violations.\r\nI commend the contributions of our neighbours — the \r\nRepublic of Benin, the Republic of Cameroon, the \r\nRepublic of Chad and the Republic of the Niger — whose \r\ncombined efforts under the Multinational Joint Task \r\nForce accomplished the present return of normalcy in \r\nareas hitherto occupied by Boko Haram. May I also \r\nthank our international partners — including France, \r\nthe United States of America, the United Kingdom \r\nof Great Britain and Northern Ireland, Germany, the \r\nUnited Nations, the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States and the African Union — and many \r\nother multilateral and bilateral partners for their \r\ninvaluable support. Our experience today is proof that, \r\nwith determined international collaboration, terrorism \r\ncan be defeated.\r\nThe f low of refugees and migrants worldwide has \r\nreached alarming proportions. That is why Nigeria \r\nsupports the ceasefire agreement brokered by the \r\nUnited States and Russia to end the atrocious tragedy \r\nof the Syrian civil war. Of particular concern to us in \r\nNigeria is the plight of internally displaced persons \r\nresulting from Boko Haram’s terrorism. We have taken \r\nconcrete steps to address their humanitarian needs and \r\nto ensure that the necessary conditions are established \r\nto enable the voluntary return of the displaced persons \r\nto their places of abode in safety and dignity.\r\nAt the same time, the Palestinian issue, despite \r\nyears and years of international efforts, is no nearer \r\nto being resolved. Nigeria, in company with States \r\nmembers of the African Union, firmly supports the \r\ntwo-State solution, with Palestinian rights to statehood \r\nin conformity with numerous Security Council \r\nresolutions, beginning with resolution 242 (1967).\r\nLet me take this opportunity to once again thank all \r\nUnited Nations and other aid agencies and development \r\npartners currently deployed in north-east Nigeria. I \r\nreaffirm Nigeria’s commitment to collective action \r\ntowards an effective global response to address the root \r\ncauses of refugee f lows worldwide.\r\nWe acknowledge the importance of youth in national \r\ndevelopment and remain committed to harnessing the \r\npotential of the increasing youth bulge. We must take \r\nadvantage of the numbers and creative energy of young \r\npeople, who are in the majority in Nigeria and in most \r\nother Member States. Therefore, at the international \r\nlevel, we call for the establishment of a specialized \r\nUnited Nations agency for youth development to \r\nachieve that strategic objective.\r\nNuclear security remains central to our quest for \r\ndurable peace and security. That was why I participated \r\nin the fifth Nuclear Security Summit, hosted by President \r\nBarak Obama in Washington in March 2016. Nigeria and \r\nthe other peace-loving States Members of the United \r\nNations must continue to uphold the fundamental \r\nprinciples of nuclear disarmament, non-proliferation \r\nand the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.\r\nThe United Nations should now redouble the long-\r\nprotracted effort for its reform to enable it to effectively \r\naddress the challenges of our times. Nigeria therefore \r\nreiterates its call for the reform of the Security Council, \r\nin particular to reflect equitable and fair representation \r\nand greater transparency, legitimacy and inclusiveness \r\nin its decision-making. Africa should be adequately \r\nrepresented on the Security Council in the permanent- \r\nmember category. In that regard, Nigeria stands ready \r\nto serve Africa and the world on a reformed Security \r\nCouncil to advance international peace and security.\r\nLet me conclude by reaffirming Nigeria’s abiding \r\nfaith in the United Nations and in its capacity to \r\nsupport Member States to deliver on the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\n20/09/2016 A/71/PV.9\r\n16-29302 17/18\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Muhammadu Buhari, President of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Nigeria, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President \r\nof the Republic of Uganda\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Uganda.\r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Museveni: I would like to congratulate \r\nthe President on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. \r\nThe theme for this session is “The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals: a universal push to transform our \r\nworld”. This is a good topic. It adds another nail in the \r\ncoffin of the old parasitic arrangement where only a \r\nsmall portion of humankind — those living in the \r\nUnited States of America, Canada, Western Europe, \r\nAustralia and New Zealand — lived in aff luence while \r\nthe rest of the world lived in abject poverty.\r\nThe reasoning then was that one could not be \r\naff luent without doing so at the expense of somebody \r\nelse. This logic has now been challenged. Between \r\n1981 and 2010, 380 million and 270 million people in \r\nChina and India, respectively, came out of poverty. \r\nEven in Africa, a continent with a lot of accumulated \r\ndisadvantages, 414 million people have come out of \r\npoverty. In Uganda’s case, in 2004 56 per cent of its \r\npeople were living in poverty. Today that figure is \r\n19 per cent. It is hoped that by 2017, it will be reduced \r\nto 10 per cent.\r\nIs the world not a better place with the spread \r\nof aff luence? Have not the old aff luent societies and \r\nthe new ones both benefited? The United States is \r\ntoday exporting goods and services to China worth \r\n$120 billion per year. The European Union is exporting \r\ngoods and services to China worth $356 billion. Has not \r\nthe spread of aff luence benefited more people?\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nunderstood this very well. There are 17 of them, and \r\nthey are: to end poverty in all its forms everywhere, to \r\nend hunger, to ensure healthy lives, to ensure inclusive \r\nand equitable quality education and to promote lifelong \r\nlearning opportunities for all, to achieve gender \r\nequality and so forth. I do not have to read out all 17 \r\nSDGs because representatives know them.\r\nAll this is a different way of providing a prescription \r\nfor the problems of underdevelopment. We are happy at \r\nlast. The global agenda includes most of the ingredients \r\nnecessary for growth and the transformation of \r\nsocieties, as happened in the past for those societies that \r\npioneered the Industrial Revolution. In particular, the \r\ninclusion of energy on the list of SDGs is a departure \r\nfrom past global agendas.\r\nThese SDGs fluctuate with many of our own \r\n10 strategic bottlenecks. These are ideological \r\ndisorientation; a weak State, especially the army, \r\nwhich needed restructuring; the suppression of the \r\nprivate sector; the underdevelopment of human \r\nresources, that is, a lack of education and health; \r\nthe underdevelopment of infrastructure, that is, the \r\nrailways, roads, electricity, telephones and piped \r\nwater and so forth; a small internal market; the lack of \r\nindustrialization; the underdevelopment of the services \r\nsector; the underdevelopment of agriculture and the \r\nattack on democracy.\r\nAs the Assembly can see, there are two crucial \r\nbottlenecks that are missing in the SDGs. These are \r\nideological disorientation, which for us is bottleneck \r\nnumber one, and market integration, which is bottleneck \r\nnumber six. One can of course say that the idea of \r\nideological disorientation is subsumed in SDG 16 — that \r\nof peace, justice and strong institutions. Nevertheless, \r\nthere is no harm in singling out and highlighting \r\nthis problem of the pseudo-ideology that exploits the \r\nidentities of people — of religion, tribe, race, gender \r\nand so forth — and eclipses the interests of the people, \r\nsuch as balanced trade. That equal relationship between \r\nthe producer of a good and the producer of a service \r\nand the buyer of the same, both in ancient and modern \r\ntimes, is the greatest stimulus for global prosperity.\r\nThis, however, is many times eclipsed by the \r\nshallow promotion of the chauvinism of religion, tribe, \r\nrace or gender, even when one’s religion mates, tribe \r\nA/71/PV.9 20/09/2016\r\n18/18 16-29302\r\nmates and race mates are doing nothing or little for \r\none’s prosperity. Yet the recent growth through trade of \r\nChina, India and so forth in their interaction with the \r\nUnited States of America, the European Union, Africa \r\nand so forth shows the power of the stimulus. Let the \r\nglobal body therefore understand and blacklist the \r\npseudo-ideology of the sectarianism and chauvinism \r\nof groups. All the past mistakes and the present ones \r\nare linked to this problem. Imperialism, the slave trade, \r\ncolonialism, neocolonialism, the ongoing sectarian \r\nconflicts in many parts of the world — all, in one way \r\nor another, spring from this pseudo-ideology. The fair \r\nand authentic ideology of being my brother’s keeper, as \r\nit says in the Book of Genesis — chapter 4, verse 9 — is \r\nthe true antidote to this poison. Abandon all forms of \r\nchauvinism and the world will be safer for everybody. \r\nIn my dialect we say, “The one who shoots arrows at \r\nothers should expect arrows to come his way”.\r\nFinally, our sixth bottleneck — the bottleneck of \r\nfragmented markets in Africa and possibly in other \r\nplaces — should also be addressed. It has eased its \r\ntrade with China, with India, with the United States, \r\nwith Russia, with Brazil and Indonesia, because they \r\nare markets of $1.3 billion, $1.2 billion, $150 million, \r\n$200 million and $200 million, respectively, because \r\nthey are societies under one political authority each.\r\nWe and the others that have fragmented markets must \r\nstruggle to rectify this deficiency. \r\nMr. Zamora Rivas (El Salvador), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair. \r\nIn Africa, we are already moving forward. Hence, \r\nour East African Community, the Common Market for \r\nEastern and Southern Africa, the Southern African \r\nDevelopment Community, the Economic Community \r\nof West African States and, ultimately, the common \r\nm+arket of the whole of Africa, as we agreed recently, \r\nin Kigali. These markets are taking us in the right \r\ndirection. Remember that when I buy what is produced \r\nby your factories, I am supporting your prosperity; and \r\nwhen you buy what I produce, you are supporting my \r\nprosperity. Long live the SDGs.  But, please, do not \r\nforget to add the bottlenecks that we observed here.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Uganda for the statement \r\nhe has just made. \r\nMr. Yoweri Kaguta Museveni, President of the \r\nRepublic of Uganda, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall. \r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
