"United Nations A/72/PV.10\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n10th plenary meeting\r\nWednesday, 20 September 2017, 6.05 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Biang (Gabon), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.05 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President \r\nof Romania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nof Romania.\r\nMr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President of Romania, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Klaus Werner \r\nIohannis, President of Romania, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Iohannis: I would like to begin my \r\nstatement by conveying my condolences to the people \r\nof Mexico in the wake of the 19 September earthquake.\r\nLet me welcome the theme of the seventy-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly, “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet”. Those are very important objectives \r\nthat will require all of our determination as responsible \r\nleaders in order to achieve them, especially when we \r\nsee obstacles before us. Indeed, people across the globe \r\nstill suffer from the brutal effects of war, poverty, \r\ninequality and injustice. Tensions over cultural identity \r\nand faith are rising, even within traditionally open and \r\ntolerant societies. Natural disasters cause increasing \r\ndamage every season. Terrorist attacks deepen the \r\nsense of insecurity.\r\nEven if there are some perceptions that the United \r\nNations has not dealt well with the multitude and \r\ncomplexity of the new crises at hand, it is clear that \r\nno path serves us better than multilateralism in finding \r\nviable solutions for the current global challenges. More \r\nthan ever, a rules-based international system — namely, \r\nthe international rule of law — is vital  our success. The \r\nUnited Nations has to be equipped with the essential \r\ntools to perform as an efficient Organization that \r\nreflects the will of its Member States and enjoys the \r\ntrust of all the people of the planet. At the same time, \r\nwe, the Member States, must increase our commitment \r\nto the Organization.\r\nDeveloping and sustaining peace require not \r\nonly a swift and adequate response to crises, but also \r\nan understanding of the root causes of conflicts and \r\ninsecurity, which rarely emerge from a single source. \r\nAt the same time, the agenda of the United Nations \r\nis not only about conflicts and crises; it is also about \r\nsustainable development and the promotion of human \r\nrights. It is about hope and a decent life for all, which \r\nrepresent the only foundation on which we can build \r\na safe and sustainable planet. Working on education \r\nand ensuring the prosperity of our peoples are the most \r\nefficient ways to prevent instability and crises. Focusing \r\nour actions on people should remain the ultimate goal. \r\nHow should we achieve that goal?\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Romania has formulated essential \r\ndevelopment policies that will have a real impact on \r\nadvancing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda. We \r\nhave chosen to involve all political actors, civil society, \r\nthe private sector and the scientific community in that \r\nprocess. To share our experience in coordinating the \r\nnational process of implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nand to discuss our progress, Romania will submit its \r\nvoluntary national review during the meeting of the \r\nHigh-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development \r\nto be held in July 2018.\r\nWe cannot lose sight of the stabilizing role that the \r\nUnited Nations plays in setting the broad parameters \r\nof contemporary international relations. That is why \r\nour efforts to improve the effectiveness of the United \r\nNations should remain strong. At the end of the day, \r\nno matter what a reformed Security Council may look \r\nlike in the future, we need the United Nations to have \r\nrobust policy-planning capabilities and the ability to \r\nproject visions for global peace and well-being beyond \r\npresent crises.\r\nRomania supports the Secretary-General’s focus on \r\nthe creation of an integrated institutional structure for \r\nsupporting a holistic approach to crisis management. \r\nWe also strongly advocate for modernizing and \r\nincreasing the effectiveness of peace operations. \r\nWe support the Secretary-General in his efforts to \r\npursue meaningful reform on three priorities: conflict \r\nprevention, sustainable development and management \r\nreform, including reshaping the Secretariat in order to \r\nmake the United Nations more efficient.\r\nMy country also welcomes the reform of the \r\ncounter-terrorism architecture of the United Nations, \r\nas well as the steps taken by the United Nations to \r\nmake counter-terrorism a key element of its prevention \r\nagenda. Since no country can fight such a terrible \r\nscourge alone, we trust that the newly established Office \r\nof Counter-Terrorism will increase our effectiveness in \r\ncombating terrorism in all its forms and manifestations. \r\nIn that respect, Romania remains committed to the \r\ncommon initiative, developed with Spain, for the \r\npossible future establishment of an international court \r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nWe also expect to see the United Nations increase its \r\ncontribution to global efforts in the area of international \r\nmigration, including in addressing the problem of its \r\nmain origins. We hope for a consistent follow-up to the \r\nNew York Declaration. In my view, it is important to \r\nensure that the global compact for migration, on which \r\nnegotiations will start soon, will cover every aspect of \r\ninternational migration, to the benefit of both migrants \r\nand host communities.\r\nWe also support the reinforcement of the human \r\nrights dimension within all relevant areas of United \r\nNations activities. That is why I welcome the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s Human Rights up Front initiative, which aims \r\nto mainstream human rights policies throughout the \r\nUnited Nations system.\r\nEarlier today, I had the pleasure of organizing a \r\ndebate on a very important topic — making education \r\nfor peace. The use of identity fears and of the us-\r\nversus-them paradigm cannot be left unanswered. In \r\nthe context of increasing violence and disinformation, \r\nRomania is convinced that it is only through quality \r\neducation that we can counter the extremist trends that \r\nour young people are facing today.\r\nAt the same time, we continue to be concerned \r\nabout security developments in and around our region. \r\nThe belt of protracted conflicts around the Black Sea \r\nremains a serious threat. We are still witnessing actions \r\nthat offend the principles and norms of international \r\nlaw. The proliferation of protracted conflicts in our \r\nneighbourhood is an obstacle to regional cooperation \r\nand has brought our mutual confidence to a historically \r\nlow level, which is why the international community \r\nshould actively support and stimulate regional \r\ncooperation and confidence-building measures and \r\ndecisively address conflicts.\r\nRomania has constantly emphasized the importance \r\nof strengthening United Nations cooperation with \r\nregional and subregional organizations. To that end, \r\nwe promoted Security Council resolution 1631 (2005) \r\nin our capacity as a non-permanent member of the \r\nCouncil at the time. Romania would be proud to once \r\nagain bring its contributions to the work of the Security \r\nCouncil. Our bid for a non-permanent seat for the 2020-\r\n2021 term is about my country’s sincere engagement \r\nin supporting the efforts of the United Nations for \r\npeace and security and our enduring commitment to \r\npeace, development and justice. If that endeavour is \r\nsuccessful, we will be honoured to work even harder \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 3/29\r\nfor the advancement of our common projects and of the \r\nOrganization as a whole.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Romania for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Klaus Werner Iohannis, President of Romania, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President \r\nof the Republic of Malawi\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Malawi.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Arthur Peter \r\nMutharika, President of the Republic of Malawi, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mutharika: The cause that rallies \r\nus together is that we are one humankind on one \r\nplanet. That is the tie that binds us all, and all our \r\ndifferences and national interests are secondary to that \r\noverriding cause.\r\nThe United Nations was founded to safeguard the \r\nhuman race, its human rights and its potential. We are \r\nhere to protect people, their existence and their rights. \r\nWe are here to ensure that the potential of every people, \r\neverywhere, fully blossoms into f lowers of hope. It is \r\nour sacred duty as a generation to take actions that offer \r\nhope to following generations.\r\nIt is therefore fitting that this year we are meeting to \r\nthink about focusing on people. In Africa, we should be \r\nfocusing on investing in the people if the full potential \r\nof African people is to be realized. The eradication of \r\npoverty and the pursuit of prosperity across the world \r\nshould be based on raising the potential of the people \r\nwe seek to support. Development cannot be taken to any \r\npeople and succeed unless it is driven from within. No \r\nhuman community can take off economically without \r\nempowering its people to drive their own development \r\nagenda. That is why I underline the importance of \r\ninvesting in our human capital.\r\nHowever, it is also a foregone conclusion that any \r\neffort to invest in the people and raise their potential \r\nneeds our collaboration as a global family; hence our \r\nappeal for concerted action by all States Members \r\nof the United Nations and, indeed, many global \r\nnon-State actors.\r\nThe adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment by the United Nations reflects our global \r\nresolve to address the world’s most pressing challenges \r\nin the spirit of sustainable human collaboration. Our \r\nunity among nations is imperative because we achieve \r\nmore when we unite and collaborate. The well-being \r\nof global society is more assured when we work in \r\npartnerships for development. At the same time, we \r\nachieve more within our nations when we include all \r\nsectors of society.\r\nStatistics provided by the United Nations and the \r\nWorld Bank show that there is a correlation between \r\nthe inclusion and empowerment of women, on the one \r\nhand, and economic growth and development, on the \r\nother. The inclusion and empowerment of women begin \r\nwith a focus on the girl child. We need to do away with \r\nearly marriages. Indeed, I am pleased to note a global \r\ndrop in early marriages from 36 per cent to 26 per cent \r\nover a period of two years since 2015.\r\nMalawi is proud to be part of that achievement. \r\nAmong other initiatives, my Government has enacted \r\na law against marriage below the age of 18. By law, \r\nMalawi provides an opportunity for girls to grow, \r\nmature and make informed choices about their \r\neducation and future life, so they are legally protected \r\nin that regard. I am therefore proud to reiterate my \r\nGovernment’s commitment to promoting gender \r\nequality and women and girls’ empowerment in order \r\nto reduce the vulnerabilities of women and adolescent \r\ngirls to violence and all forms of abuse.\r\nAnother critical category in the focus on people is \r\nyoung people. Youth empowerment is a way to achieve \r\ninclusion. According to African Economic Outlook \r\n2015, Africa has the fastest-growing and youngest \r\npopulation in the world. In giving young people the \r\nfocus they deserve, the African Union agreed in 2015 \r\nto designate 2017 the Year of the Youth. This is the year \r\nwe focus on investing in young people.\r\nMalawi is honoured to be part of the mission for \r\nyouth empowerment. We have taken decisive measures \r\nthat include providing technical and entrepreneurial \r\neducation to the young people who have not had the \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n4/29 17-29407\r\nopportunity to attend university. At the same time, we \r\nare also increasing access to tertiary education.\r\nOne more category that needs inclusion is that \r\nof persons with disabilities. Malawi is reviewing its \r\npolicies and strategies in education, health and trade in \r\norder to foster the effective inclusion of persons with \r\ndisabilities. We have also made strides in efforts to \r\neradicate vicious and irrational attacks against persons \r\nwith albinism. There was a time when these attacks \r\nwere rampant in some parts of the country. I am glad \r\nto report that there have not been any new ones in the \r\npast six months.\r\nMalawi is committed to inclusive development. We \r\nrecognize, however, that the majority of our citizens \r\ncontinue to depend on agriculture for their livelihood. \r\nBut agriculture is a challenging sector, given the \r\ncurrent climate variability affecting many parts of the \r\nworld. That being the case, Malawi is implementing \r\nsocial protection programmes aimed at cushioning the \r\nvulnerable in our society. Our measures include cash \r\ntransfer programmes, food for work, school feeding \r\nprogrammes and a farm income subsidy programme. \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express our \r\ngratitude to cooperating partners, including the United \r\nNations, for their continued technical and other support \r\nto the success of these programmes.\r\nAs we think of focusing on people, it is important \r\nto pay close attention to the issues that affect our most \r\nvulnerable citizens. Climate change tops the list. For \r\nan economy that depends on agriculture, like that of \r\nMalawi, where 85 per cent of the people live in agrarian \r\ncommunities, crop failure is always a tragedy. For the \r\npast two years, Malawi has suffered alternating heavy \r\nrains, f loods and drought that have led to crop failure \r\nand hunger. The suffering caused by climate change is \r\nevident everywhere; it is real. The people who suffer \r\nin these tragedies are not just figures and statistics, \r\nbut real human souls. We must all feel the urgent need \r\nto collectively undertake sustainable management of \r\nour natural resources. We must remember that if this \r\nplanet perishes, we all perish with it. This is a matter \r\nthat demands our collective responsibility. I therefore \r\nappeal to all Member States to consider strategies and \r\navenues of collaboration that will enable us to adapt to \r\nthe fast-changing climate.\r\nApart from climate change, our world is also \r\ncollectively facing the threat of terrorism. Terrorism \r\nand conflict hinder progress and leave the world in a \r\nstate of fear, and anything that causes humankind to \r\nlive in a state of fear is an evil to be fought. Malawi \r\nstands in solidarity with the victims of terrorism across \r\nthe world. We reaffirm our commitment to standing \r\nagainst all forms of terrorism and we stand in solidarity \r\nwith the victims of human trafficking and forced \r\nmigration, wherever they are.\r\nLet me now move on to the question of peace. \r\nPeace is a prerequisite for development. As a country, \r\nwe believe in peace as a necessary condition for human \r\nexistence. For that reason, Malawi has been active in \r\nthe peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations of the \r\nUnited Nations and the African Union. Today, Malawi \r\nreaffirms its pledge to continue to act as an envoy \r\nof peace. We believe that is our duty to humankind. \r\nWe believe that in protecting our neighbours, we \r\nprotect ourselves.\r\nWhile we all seek peace as a necessary condition for \r\nexistence, we also still face the threat of nuclear weapons. \r\nNuclear weapons are an existential threat to humankind \r\nand of concern to us all. Ironically, even those nations \r\nthat possess nuclear weapons are concerned about \r\nsuch threats. The idea of stockpiling nuclear weapons \r\nputs the wisdom of humankind in question. Let me \r\ncategorically express my Government’s disapproval of \r\nthe spread of ballistic-missile technology, which should \r\nnot be tolerated in any way by any State Member of the \r\nUnited Nations. No country is too small to contribute \r\nto the peace agenda of the world and no continent is too \r\npoor to be part of the global peace agenda.\r\nMalawi strongly supports the African position in \r\nfavour of our continent’s full representation on the \r\nSecurity Council. The United Nations can no longer \r\nclaim to take the lead in democracy while sidelining \r\nthe representation of 1.2 billion people in Africa. \r\nHow can we claim to be united with those whom we \r\nexclude? Africa must be included at the table of global \r\ngovernance. Our rising Africa is always ready to play \r\nits role in the global community, and Malawi will \r\ncontinue to be a global player.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Malawi for the statement he has just \r\nmade.\r\nMr. Arthur Peter Mutharika, President of the \r\nRepublic of Malawi, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 5/29\r\nAddress by Mr. Hery Martial \r\nRajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Madagascar\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Madagascar.\r\nMr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Madagascar, was escorted into \r\nthe General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Hery Martial \r\nRajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana, President \r\nof the Republic of Madagascar, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Rajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana \r\n(spoke in French): I am very proud and honoured to be \r\naddressing the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession in my capacity not only as President of the \r\nRepublic of Madagascar and on behalf of the Malagasy \r\npeople, but also as President of the Common Market for \r\nEastern and Southern Africa and current President of \r\nthe Summit of la Francophonie.\r\nAt the outset, I would like to welcome the \r\nelection of Mr. Miroslav Lajčák as President of the \r\nAssembly and to extend to him my sincerest and \r\nwarmest congratulations. Madagascar, at his side as a \r\nVice-President of the Assembly, which brings together \r\nthe 193 States Members of the United Nations, and as \r\nhost of the sixteenth Summit of la Francophonie, on \r\n26 and 27 November 2016, can only share in the values \r\nand ideals that unite us here to achieve a more just and \r\nstable world together — development, peace, security \r\nand international law.\r\nThe theme of our debate, “Focusing on the human \r\nbeing: Striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet”, appeals to us all because \r\nthe very raison d’être of every State is to ensure its \r\npeople’s welfare through the ways and means of their \r\nown choosing. For Madagascar, the choice is clear \r\nand obvious. We have placed and continue to place \r\nthe human individual at the centre of our concerns. \r\nWe therefore welcome the relevance of this year’s \r\ntheme, and I am happy to share with the Members of \r\nthe Assembly what we have done and strive to do in \r\nMadagascar since 2014 to provide a better and decent \r\nlife for the Malagasy.\r\nThe challenges that awaited me in 2014 — when \r\nI was elected by the Malagasy people to preside over \r\ntheir destiny on the heels of our protracted emergence \r\nfrom a five-year political, economic and social \r\ncrisis — were significant. The country and people had \r\nbeen overwhelmed by international sanctions for five \r\nyears, which exacerbated the poverty rate, affecting \r\n92 per cent of the population, and the incidence of food \r\ninsecurity and malnutrition. The logical outcome of the \r\ncrisis was political and social instability and an anaemic \r\neconomy, not to mention corruption and insecurity.\r\nHowever, we stepped up to meet those challenges. \r\nWe were fully convinced that Madagascar had no \r\nreason to remain poor, with its potential and its people, \r\nmore than 50 per cent of whom are women and more \r\nthan 61.3 per cent under 25 years of age. If everyone \r\nmakes their own resolute contribution, then I truly \r\nbelieve — optimist that I am — in economic recovery \r\nand national reconstruction leading to renewed growth. \r\nThose three pillars will enable our State to consolidate \r\na people-centred approach. In fact, like many of the \r\nleaders and high-ranking officials present in the Hall, I \r\nam an upbeat optimist about my country, my continent \r\nand our collective future. Faced with challenges, I often \r\nthink about what Nelson Mandela said: \r\n“After climbing a great hill, one only finds that \r\nthere are many more hills to climb. It always seems \r\nimpossible until done.”\r\nThere can be no doubt that this affirmation holds true \r\nfor us all. \r\nToday, one year before Madagascar’s 2018 \r\npresidential elections, after continued and determined \r\nefforts, I can say that Madagascar has reached a \r\nmilestone and a level that gives rise to the highest \r\nhopes, given the progress made in terms of both \r\npolitical stability, however fragile, and economic and \r\nsocial prospects. In that context, I can say that since \r\n2016, Madagascar has raised $6.4 billion in global \r\ninvestment and aid from institutional donors. That \r\nhas enabled us to start investing in key sectors of our \r\neconomy and the future of our country. Worksites have \r\nbeen opened everywhere with a view to permanently \r\nreducing the poverty of my country and assisting our \r\nmost vulnerable strata. Our efforts have included \r\ninstitutional standardization, good governance and the \r\nestablishment of conditions conducive to improving \r\nthe political climate, in particular through national \r\nreconciliation and implementation of our national \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n6/29 17-29407\r\ndevelopment plan for revitalizing our economy through \r\nrealizing the real potential of our wealth.\r\nOur policy of establishing basic infrastructure \r\nin many sectors is beginning to bear fruit. We have \r\nreceived support from our partners in implementing \r\nthe bases of the 2015-2019 national development plan in \r\nagriculture, cattle-raising, energy and fisheries. Lastly, \r\nwe have shown that Madagascar can play a part on the \r\nworld stage by successfully hosting and organizing \r\nregional and international summits, including for the \r\nCommon Market for Eastern and Southern Africa \r\nand the Summit of la Francophonie, of which we are \r\ncurrently President.\r\nThis year, we intend to pursue projects that include \r\nestablishing special economic zones in two areas, \r\ncreating pilot digital cities, accelerating our energy \r\ntransition and strengthening basic infrastructure to \r\nimprove education and public health. In the social \r\nsector, too, we are investing in education and training \r\ndoctors, teachers and engineers.\r\nIn order to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 4, \r\nmy Government has developed an ambitious education \r\nsector plan to ensure that children in Madagascar have \r\naccess to quality education. We are also investing in \r\nrebuilding our health-care system, which was gutted \r\nand destroyed during the years under sanctions. We \r\nhave also reopened the health centres that were closed \r\nduring the crisis periods in order to revitalize the \r\nnetwork and expand it nationally.\r\nIn general, we have established a platform for \r\nstrengthening our health-care system to coordinate the \r\nhealth-related interventions of our various partners and \r\nimprove our monitoring of disease. Madagascar has \r\ncreated a digital epidemiological surveillance system \r\nthat enables it to monitor in real time 28 diseases that \r\nhave the potential to become epidemics. In addition, \r\nthe Government has taken steps to promote long-term \r\nactions such as launching universal health coverage and \r\nreducing maternal and infant mortality, a major aspect \r\nof maternal, newborn and child health.\r\nThe budget for nutrition has been increased, \r\nagricultural production has been diversified and specific \r\nwater, sanitation and nutrition projects targeting \r\nvulnerable populations have been implemented through \r\nour national nutrition action plan.\r\nWe are also investing in infrastructure to create \r\njobs and accelerate economic growth. We are investing \r\nin ports, highways, bridges and airports, which will \r\nreintegrate Madagascar into the global economy. \r\nWe are also strengthening our tourism industry to \r\ncreate decent, paying jobs and preserve our unique \r\nand invaluable ecology and biodiversity. In that \r\ncontext, Madagascar has always sought to uphold \r\nits international commitments. The commitment we \r\nentered into in Durban in 2002 to tripling our protected \r\narea has been honoured; today those areas encompass \r\nmore than 6.9 million hectares, in addition to our \r\nmarine protected areas.\r\nIn order to effectively tackle poverty, we must \r\nsustainably create wealth for the largest possible number \r\nof people while ensuring the responsible management \r\nof natural resources and combating global warming. \r\nWe must also develop and implement appropriate \r\nsustainable development as quickly as possible. Low-\r\ncarbon, inclusive and shared growth that creates jobs, \r\nin particular for women and young people, must be the \r\neconomic model of tomorrow in order to ensure that \r\nfuture generations enjoy better living conditions in a \r\nprotected environment.\r\nGiven climate change and the threats to natural \r\nresources, biodiversity and ecosystems, we have no \r\nchoice but to act quickly and we must not waste time. \r\nWe therefore support the initiatives of the President of \r\nFrance aimed at putting a global environment pact in \r\nplace. I take this opportunity to thank the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco for providing financial assistance to \r\nMadagascar, which is currently suffering from drought, \r\nin the framework of bilateral South-South cooperation. \r\nThat is concrete action.\r\nOur agriculture, which accounts for 26.4 per cent \r\nof our overall gross domestic product and employs \r\nmore than 75 per cent of the workforce, is considered \r\none of the main drivers of our economy. We are \r\nmaking additional efforts to meet the challenges of \r\nestablishing and developing agribusiness through land \r\nreform in order to enable peasants to own land. We \r\nare increasing productivity, building infrastructure, \r\nguiding production to allow access to markets, capital, \r\nseeds and inputs, and providing technical services \r\nand training.\r\nGiven all of this, the economic outlook for \r\nMadagascar is favourable; our growth rate is around \r\n4 per cent in 2017 and next year will exceed 5 per cent. \r\nThat will create economic momentum and help to \r\nestablish a new development trajectory for improving \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 7/29\r\nthe lives of the people of Madagascar. Our aim is to \r\nraise Madagascar to the rank of a middle-income \r\ncountry by 2030.\r\nI take this opportunity to inform the Assembly \r\nthat we have begun a reform process for improving the \r\nindependence of our judiciary and our anti-corruption \r\noffice. We have prepared measures to protect the \r\nintegrity of our democratic processes, not to mention \r\npublic security, which is a very sensitive area in \r\nMadagascar. The reforms we have undertaken have \r\nallowed us to enjoy lasting economic recovery, and I \r\nam convinced that this recovery will be supported \r\nby greater investment. Our economic growth rate is \r\nexpected to reach more than 6 per cent per year by \r\n2020. That is attainable.\r\nYesterday, in his speech at the opening of the \r\ngeneral debate (see A/72/PV.3), the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly expressed the hope that next year \r\nhis successor would be able to commend the progress \r\nmade at the seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly with regard to such global challenges as the \r\nstate of global peace and security, global disparities and \r\ninequalities, persistent poverty, the outrageous fact that \r\nwe have more than 65 million refugees, international \r\nterrorism, human rights, the preservation of the planet \r\nand so forth. The General Assembly already has the \r\ntools it needs to do this, and now it is a matter of \r\nstrengthening them and improving the way they are \r\nused by emphasizing prevention. Madagascar will \r\nsupport the President in that regard.\r\nThis is also an opportunity for me to reiterate from \r\nthe magnificent sounding board that is the rostrum of the \r\nGeneral Assembly the appeal launched in Antananarivo \r\nat the sixteenth Summit of la Francophonie:\r\n“Our Francophone community, aware of its \r\nresponsibilities and based on the Antananarivo \r\nDeclaration, is determined to work for shared \r\ngrowth, sustainable and responsible development, \r\nand the establishment of fairer and more united \r\neconomic relations by strengthening our dialogue \r\nand influence in international forums. By holding \r\nhigh our values of solidarity and sharing for a \r\nmore peaceful world, we call for a new model of \r\nsustainable and inclusive development that responds \r\nto the concerns and meets the expectations of our \r\npeoples.”\r\nWe must also recall the importance of investing in youth.\r\nI was pleased to learn yesterday that the first meeting \r\nof the United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, \r\nwhich was established at the initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, will be held next year. Madagascar expresses \r\nits readiness to work closely with the United Nations to \r\nsustainably eradicate the scourge of terrorism.\r\nFinally, I cannot conclude without expressing my \r\nheartfelt sympathy for Mexico, which just yesterday \r\nexperienced a new, deadly earthquake in Mexico City. \r\nOn behalf of the country and the people of Madagascar \r\nand myself, I would like to express my solidarity, \r\ncompassion and sincere condolences to the President, \r\nthe people and the Government of Mexico, with special \r\nthoughts for those who have lost loved ones.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of Madagascar for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Hery Martial Rajaonarimampianina Rakotoarimanana, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Madagascar, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Macky Sall, President of the \r\nRepublic of Senegal\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Senegal.\r\nMr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Macky Sall, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Senegal, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sall (spoke in French): The Senegalese \r\ndelegation would like to thank the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session and to wish \r\nthe current President every success in guiding the \r\nwork of our session. I would also like to reiterate our \r\ncongratulations and support to Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres for the success of his mission at the \r\nhead of the Organization.\r\nThe theme of the seventy-second session commits \r\nus to focusing on people for peace and a decent life \r\nfor all on a sustainable planet. Unfortunately, in these \r\ntimes of turbulence and uncertainty, the ideal of a better \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n8/29 17-29407\r\nworld for all comes up against the crises of a world of \r\nconflict that is also in conflict with itself.\r\nOn the security and humanitarian fronts, millions \r\nof individuals continue to suffer every day from the \r\nravages of war, terrorism and violence in all their forms. \r\nWith regard to food crises, according to the Food and \r\nAgriculture Organization, more than 1 billion tons of \r\nfood are wasted each year, while more than 795 million \r\npeople go hungry every day.\r\nWhere the environment is concerned, global \r\nwarming has reached an unprecedented level, while \r\nagreed-on commitments to addressing the related \r\ncrises, including adequate Green Climate Fund \r\nfinancing, have been slow to materialize.\r\nWith regard to our ethical and moral crises, we see \r\nthe universal mission of democracy and human rights \r\nproclaimed at the same time that it turns in on itself \r\nand lets extremist, racist and xenophobic tendencies \r\nre-emerge. These dangerous excesses, born out of the \r\nabsurd claim that one race, civilization or culture is \r\nsuperior to others, have inspired the worst tragedies of \r\nhistory, including slavery, colonization, the Holocaust \r\nand apartheid.\r\nIf we yield to these abuses, we renounce the \r\nfounding values of the United Nations. We forget that \r\nthe true challenges of our time lie elsewhere, such as \r\nin the fight against the threat of terrorism. Senegal, I \r\nemphasize, vigorously condemns terrorism wherever \r\nit may strike. Nothing, and certainly not religion, can \r\njustify violent fanaticism. At the same time, we cannot \r\naccept the equation of Islam with violence. We cannot \r\naccept that Muslims are held accountable for violence \r\nof which they themselves are victims.\r\nWe are all concerned about the terrorist threat. \r\nWe therefore have a responsibility to work together \r\nto find agreed solutions to this scourge. That is the \r\npurpose of the Dakar International Forum on Peace \r\nand Security in Africa, whose fourth meeting will be \r\nheld on 13 and 14 November. Among other topics, the \r\nForum will focus on the doctrinal response of Islam \r\nvis-à-vis violent extremism. We wish to see an Africa \r\nof peace and security, a place that does not serve as a \r\nhaven for terrorist groups that are fought and defeated \r\nelsewhere. That is why Senegal remains engaged in \r\nseven peacekeeping operations, including the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in Mali, and welcomes the efforts of the Group \r\nof Five for the Sahel and its partner States in the fight \r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nI would like to reiterate our support for the national \r\npeace and reconciliation process under way in our \r\nsister Republic of Mali, a process that is taking place \r\nwith respect for the country’s territorial integrity and \r\nin accordance with Security Council resolution 2374 \r\n(2017).\r\nIn the Middle East, Senegal reiterates the right of \r\nthe Palestinian people to a viable State, living side by \r\nside in peace with the State of Israel, each within secure \r\nand internationally recognized borders.\r\nIn Burma, we are seriously concerned about \r\nthe abuses of the Muslim Rohingya population. We \r\ntherefore cannot allow outrage to be a selective emotion, \r\nand Senegal urges the international community to take \r\naction to put an end to this genuine human tragedy.\r\nIn a world of interaction and interdependence, \r\npeace today, more so than in the past, is not merely the \r\nabsence of war. It is also the preservation of the planet’s \r\nresources, the scarcity of which increases the risk of \r\ninternal crises and of international conflicts. It is vital \r\nto safeguard the integrity of the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. The future of the planet is at stake.\r\nPeace also requires fairer international trade that \r\npaves the way for progress and prosperity for all. The \r\nworld cannot be at peace with itself as long as there \r\nendures a system of unequal exchanges in which the \r\nhaves continue to earn more and the have-nots to \r\nhave even less. We must work for mutually beneficial \r\nexchanges that protect investment, pay fairly for raw \r\nmaterials and generate shared prosperity. That is the best \r\nway to overcome poverty, to support Africa’s efforts to \r\nemerge and to curb illegal migratory movements.\r\nAs the current Chair of the New Partnership \r\nfor Africa’s Development, I welcome the Compact \r\nwith Africa initiative, launched by Germany within \r\nthe framework of the Group of 20, to stimulate \r\ninvestment on the African continent. As part of this \r\nnew momentum of support for development through \r\npartnership, Senegal looks forward to hosting three \r\nmajor events on the international community’s agenda. \r\nThey are the third Africa Investment Forum, from \r\n25 to 27 September, in cooperation with China and the \r\nWorld Bank; the International Conference on Quality \r\nInfrastructure in January 2018, at the initiative of \r\nJapan; and, on 8 February 2018, the replenishment \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 9/29\r\nconference for the Global Partnership for Education \r\nFund, amounting to $3.1 billion over three years. By \r\nmobilizing these resources, we will give millions of \r\nchildren the opportunity to go to school and achieve \r\ntheir dreams of a fulfilled life. I thank France for \r\nsponsoring the conference, together with Senegal, and \r\nwe invite all partner and beneficiary States to attend.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe positive changes we seek to promote in the \r\nworld’s affairs will succeed only in the context of an \r\ninclusive and equitable momentum that reconciles all of \r\nour interests. To that end, the time has come to afford \r\nAfrica the place it deserves on the Security Council, as \r\ncalled for in the Ezulwini Consensus. It is time to reform \r\nthe rules of global economic and financial governance, \r\nincluding by combating tax evasion more effectively \r\nto help mobilize domestic resources for development \r\nfinancing. It is time to stop seeing Africa as a continent of \r\nthe future, content with random and uncertain promises \r\nthat others design, write and interpret on its behalf. \r\nAfrica wishes to be a stakeholder in a present that takes \r\nits interests and its need to emerge into account through \r\nrenewed and mutually beneficial partnerships. It is in \r\nthat spirit that Senegal will continue to work with all \r\nfriendly countries and partners after its mandate on the \r\nSecurity Council ends, in a few months’ time.\r\nDespite the uncertainties and difficulties of our \r\ntimes, we must continue to have faith in multilateralism. \r\nPreceding generations had the wisdom to understand \r\nthat isolationism and belligerency are a dead end. Out \r\nof the ruins of war, they built the foundations of peace; \r\nbut it is a peace that is always a work in progress. \r\nWhenever its foundations falter, all humankind is \r\nthreatened. The wisdom of our predecessors demands \r\nthat we work together to safeguard peace, in the name \r\nof our shared humanity, which brings us together and \r\nassigns us a shared destiny.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Senegal \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Macky Sall, President of the Republic of Senegal, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by King Mswati III, Head of State of the \r\nKingdom of Swaziland\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Head of State of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland.\r\nKing Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nMajesty King Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom \r\nof Swaziland, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nKing Mswati III: Allow me to express our sincere \r\ncongratulations to you, Mr. President, on your election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. We commend you for immediately \r\nidentifying six overarching priorities for your tenure, \r\nwhich touch on attaining peace, giving impetus to \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, climate change \r\ncommitments, equality and human rights for all, \r\namong others. These priorities truly capture several of \r\nthe current troublesome global challenges and we look \r\nforward to working closely with you on these issues.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini would also like to \r\ncommend the leadership of the new Secretary-General, \r\nwho is committed to transforming the United Nations \r\ninto an Organization fit for the twenty-first century. \r\nReform of the United Nations and its attendant bodies \r\nhas been under discussion for a long time. My delegation \r\nbelieves that fresh impetus must be given to this \r\nprocess and tangible progress made. We are therefore \r\nencouraged by the Secretary-General’s intention to \r\nrefocus our attention on the reform agenda.\r\nReform of the Security Council is a key aspect of \r\nthe process, and no transformation could be complete \r\nwithout its fundamental change. To that end, the \r\nKingdom of eSwatini wishes to reiterate Africa’s \r\ncall for a permanent seat on the Security Council, in \r\naccordance with the Ezulwini Consensus. The United \r\nNations is urged to listen to the voice of the millions of \r\nAfricans who want to contribute to the welfare of the \r\nglobal community as equal partners.\r\nWe are confident that under the able leadership \r\nof the Secretary-General, the United Nations will \r\nreach greater heights in its support for countries in \r\nimplementing the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change. The United Nations staff are \r\nalso to be congratulated on their remarkable work in \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n10/29 17-29407\r\nsupporting inclusive and sustainable development, \r\ntackling diseases, promoting peace and stability and \r\ncreating a conducive environment for humankind to \r\nlive in, sometimes under extremely inimical conditions.\r\nThe theme of this session — “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on \r\na sustainable planet” — resonates perfectly with the \r\nmotto of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nof leaving no one behind. The theme is indeed cross-\r\ncutting in nature, as it affects every aspect of life. It \r\ncalls on all of us to work to create peaceful countries, \r\ncontinents and a sustainable world in which people can \r\nlead peaceful and prosperous lives. In that regard, we \r\nwish to urge Member States to join hands in addressing \r\nthe issue of nuclear threats, which have the potential \r\nto disrupt world peace. No country has the right to \r\nmake the world an unsafe place to live in, and we owe \r\nit to our people and future generations to put a stop to \r\nnuclear threats.\r\nTerrorism remains a threat to the safety of our \r\npeoples in various parts of the world. It is a setback \r\nto key development issues that deserve the priority \r\nattention of the United Nations.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini is committed to peace \r\nand a decent life for all. We are also firm believers in \r\nthe principle of consultative decision-making, which is \r\na transparent and all-inclusive undertaking and grants \r\nall citizens an opportunity to voice their views so as \r\nto constructively contribute to our country’s social, \r\neconomic, cultural and political development.\r\nWe are committed to the SDGs, as they provide \r\na development framework within which the global \r\ncommunity is able to strive for the inclusive and \r\nsustainable development of its respective countries. \r\nWe have taken several initiatives to mainstream and \r\nlocalize the SDGs through public-awareness campaigns, \r\nconsultations, education and training at all levels. The \r\nKingdom of eSwatini has also integrated the Goals \r\ninto its national development strategy, which has been \r\nrevised to ensure that it is linked to the SDGs and the \r\nAfrican Union’s Agenda 2063. Appropriate institutional \r\narrangements are now in place for properly monitoring \r\nthe implementation of the Goals at all levels.\r\nSustainable Development Goal 13 calls for urgent \r\naction to combat climate change and its impacts. That \r\nurgency is now a global reality, and recent weather \r\nepisodes around the world, such as hurricanes, f loods \r\nand mudslides, have shown that no nation is immune to \r\nits effects. The Kingdom of eSwatini is no exception. \r\nIn 2015 and 2016, the southern African countries, \r\nincluding our Kingdom, faced a severe drought. Its \r\ndevastating effects, aggravated by the fall armyworm, \r\nadversely affected crop production. Funds from other \r\nprojects and activities were diverted to mitigate the \r\nchallenges. The scale of the drought led the Southern \r\nAfrican Development Community (SADC) region to \r\ndeclare it a natural disaster. We are grateful to the United \r\nNations, our development partners, the international \r\ncommunity, non-governmental organizations and other \r\nlocal organizations for supporting us during that period.\r\nThe Government will continue its programme of \r\nfarming input subsidies for our farmers, and developing \r\nadequate water-harvesting infrastructure to enhance \r\nfood sufficiency will always remain one of our top \r\npriorities. We urge donors and all nations not only \r\nto fulfil their pledges to the Green Fund but also to \r\nadopt policies that strike a correct balance between the \r\nproduction of essential products and the environmental \r\nsustainability we need to protect and preserve the world \r\nfor future generations.\r\nThe net enrolment ratio in primary schools in the \r\nKingdom increased significantly from 79.2 per cent \r\nin 2000 to 97.7 per cent in 2015, in a reflection of my \r\ncountry’s efforts to ensure that all children have access \r\nto education, irrespective of their socioeconomic \r\nstatus. The Government is also providing for our \r\nchildren’s needs by placing greater focus on assisting \r\nthose who are orphaned and vulnerable through various \r\nprogrammes that ensure that they too can access free \r\nprimary-school education and have adequate nutrition \r\nthrough school feeding schemes.\r\nIn our quest to achieve a decent life for all, and in \r\nline with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand Africa’s Agenda 2063, the Kingdom of eSwatini \r\nhas put in place several all-inclusive initiatives that \r\nare aimed at ensuring that no one is left behind. The \r\nGovernment also provides grants to the elderly as a way \r\nof supplementing their livelihoods.\r\nThe Kingdom is also developing innovation parks \r\nthat will equip our young people with creative skills \r\nthat can enable them to contribute to the country’s \r\nsustainable development. We would like to forge \r\npartnerships with well-established international parks \r\nto leverage and learn from their experience, and we \r\nhave urged our private sector to take advantage of that \r\ninitiative. We believe that together with many others, \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 11/29\r\nthis initiative will help to nurture a future generation \r\nthat is skilled and well equipped to provide solutions to \r\nthe socioeconomic challenges and youth unemployment \r\nthat our nation is facing.\r\nThe Kingdom of eSwatini will host the SADC \r\nUniversity of Innovation and Technology, which is \r\nexpected to produce highly skilled manpower and \r\nprovide solutions for transforming economies, thereby \r\nenabling countries in the SADC region to close their \r\nskills gap. We are seeking the support of highly \r\neducated facilitators and the international community \r\nto make that project a reality.\r\nTackling poverty, hunger and the disease burden \r\nand improving our people’s basic standards of living \r\nhave been at the centre of our Vision 2022 and national \r\ndevelopment strategy. The importance of human capital \r\ninvestment and promoting the interests of vulnerable \r\ngroups represent crucial steps towards economic \r\ngrowth and prosperity.\r\nI have full confidence in our innovative and \r\neducated workforce, which has demonstrated an \r\nindomitable spirit and resilience in overcoming the \r\nsevere social, economic and environmental challenges \r\nof recent times. As a result, our national guiding theme \r\nfor 2017 is “Rising above adversity to create prosperity \r\nfor all”. The critical importance of the demographic \r\ndividend to Africa’s transformative development \r\nhas been acknowledged by African leaders. They \r\nhave recognized the urgent need to accelerate the \r\nimplementation of the African Union Roadmap on \r\nHarnessing the Demographic Dividend through \r\nInvestments in Youth.\r\nThe HIV and AIDS pandemic remains one of \r\nour priority areas, as it continues to undermine our \r\nsustainable development objectives. It is stretching our \r\nhealth resources to the limit and calls for collective \r\naction on the part of the Government, international \r\ndonors and other stakeholders to address it. As a nation, \r\nwe have decided to work to reach AIDS-free status by \r\n2022, a vision in line with Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 3, ending AIDS by 2030.\r\nWe are pleased to be able to inform the Assembly \r\nof the positive results we have attained through our \r\nconcerted policies in tackling this scourge. Key findings \r\nfrom Swaziland’s second HIV incidence measurement \r\nsurvey show that we have achieved a more than 70 per \r\ncent viral load suppression among adults living with \r\nHIV. We also reduced HIV incidence by nearly half \r\nbetween 2011 and 2016, a major achievement. While we \r\nare encouraged by these results, we will continue to do \r\neverything in our ability to ensure that there are no new \r\ninfections.\r\nWe are also pleased to mention that our efforts to \r\ntackle malaria eradication are being recognized. We \r\nwere honoured that during the African Union Summit \r\nin Addis Ababa in January, Africa’s Heads of State and \r\nGovernment elected us Chair of the African Leaders’ \r\nMalaria Alliance. Tomorrow we will hold a side event \r\non malaria here at United Nations Headquarters. \r\nMalaria is a scourge that requires our concerted efforts \r\nto eradicate from the face of the Earth. We aim to \r\npartner with our private sector in Africa and beyond \r\nto mobilize resources to combat it. We appreciate \r\nour partners’ support and also appeal to financial \r\ninstitutions, development partners and donors to join \r\nus in this fight, since it will pay handsome dividends \r\nfor the people of our beloved African continent.\r\nAmong the political issues that have continued \r\nunresolved for too long is the denial of the right of \r\nthe people of the Republic of China on Taiwan to \r\nparticipate in the United Nations system. Taiwan has \r\nshown significant commitment to the ideals of the \r\nUnited Nations and has aligned its priorities with those \r\nof the Organization. Humankind could therefore benefit \r\na great deal from Taiwan’s experience in the framework \r\nof our global agenda as Member of the United Nations.\r\nI reaffirm the full commitment of the Government \r\nof the Kingdom of eSwatini to implementing the Goals \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nHowever, it is worth noting that while our Goals may \r\nbe universal, we do not all have the same capabilities \r\nand capacities for implementing them. As we recognize \r\nthose resource and capacity constraints, therefore, \r\nwe need to enhance resources, capacity-building, \r\ntechnology transfer and South-South cooperation so \r\nas to support lower middle-income countries, along \r\nwith the least developed countries, in achieving our \r\nambitious and transformative Agenda.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Head of State of the Kingdom of \r\nSwaziland for the statement he has just made.\r\nKing Mswati III, Head of State of the Kingdom \r\nof Swaziland, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n12/29 17-29407\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Faiez Mustafa \r\nSerraj, President of the Presidency Council of the \r\nGovernment of National Accord of Libya\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Presidency Council of \r\nthe Government of National Accord of Libya.\r\nMr. Faiez Mustafa Serraj, President of the \r\nPresidency Council of the Government of National \r\nAccord of Libya, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Faiez Mustafa Serraj, President \r\nof the Presidency Council of the Government of \r\nNational Accord of Libya, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Serraj (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, I \r\nwould like to congratulate you, Mr. President, on your \r\nelection to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session, and to wish you every success in \r\nyour work. I commend your predecessor, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, for all his efforts and wish him every success \r\nin his future endeavours. I would also like to note the \r\nongoing wise efforts of Secretary-General Guterres to \r\nimplement the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations in the areas of peace, security and \r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe members of the General Assembly are aware of \r\nthe challenges that my people are facing in these very \r\ntrying times, starting with the revolution of February \r\n2011 and its consequences, which have been a war \r\nand the negative involvement of a number of States. \r\nWe have striven to mitigate and reduce our people’s \r\nsuffering and to achieve real success. However, a great \r\nmany problems remain and will not be resolved without \r\nthe joint efforts of my country and of friendly States \r\nand the United Nations to enable us to establish the rule \r\nof law and democracy in Libya.\r\nI would like to commend the efforts of all those \r\nwho have worked to find a political settlement to the \r\ncrisis and to thank a number of States and regional and \r\ninternational organizations — including the League \r\nof Arab States, the African Union, the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation and the United Nations — for \r\nhelping us to restore stability in my country. I would \r\nalso like to take this opportunity to welcome the new \r\nSpecial Envoy, Mr. Ghassan Salamé, and to wish him \r\nevery possible success in proposing rapid solutions to \r\nthe current crisis.\r\nThe Libyan Political Agreement reached following \r\ntwo years of negotiations remains the cornerstone for \r\nour efforts to address various problems and build the \r\ninstitutions of State. We are undergoing a transition that \r\nwill ensure that we can coexist, leave the past behind us \r\nand stabilize our country, and the Presidency Council \r\nof the Government of National Accord is the fruit of all \r\nthis work. It is essential to implementing and carrying \r\nout national reconciliation with the participation of all, \r\nwithout exception.\r\nSince the outset we have been determined to \r\nconfront our crises, despite the difficulties they pose, \r\nwith wisdom, patience and foresight, and we have been \r\nable to resolve a number of problems. We have put an end \r\nto the violence in Tripoli and other Libyan cities, where \r\nlaw enforcement and security agencies have started to \r\ndischarge their mission. A number of embassies have \r\nreturned, as will the United Nations Support Mission in \r\nLibya in the near future. Certain displaced individuals \r\nhave returned to their home cities, although that has not \r\nbeen possible for others, owing to the lack of services, \r\nundermined by the military clashes. We continue to \r\nwork to restore peace and security and rid ourselves \r\nof those trying to spoil things.\r\nIn the economic field, we are now producing \r\n1 million barrels of oil a day, up from 150,000 in \r\nMarch 2016. We must also mitigate the suffering that \r\nmany have been experiencing during this development \r\nperiod, and we hope that with the restoration of security, \r\nthe provision of the necessary financial resources and \r\nthe resumption of activity by foreign firms we will be \r\nable to rebuild our State. We have demanded that the \r\nembargo on frozen assets be lifted, because it is costing \r\nthe Libyan State close to $1 billion a year, and we \r\nsincerely hope that this will happen, especially since \r\ncurrent circumstances are improving.\r\nIn the area of national reconciliation, we have \r\nheld a number of meetings aimed at achieving unity \r\nand resolving our differences and divisions. The \r\ndecision-making monopoly of the Presidency of the \r\nCouncil of Deputies has resulted in political stagnation, \r\npreventing the majority from implementing the Political \r\nAgreement. In July, we came up with a road map for \r\nextricating ourselves from this crisis, providing for \r\na referendum and presidential and parliamentary \r\nelections next year and the establishment of a supreme \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 13/29\r\nnational council for reconciliation, mandated to address \r\nsuch issues as compensation, amnesty and others \r\nduring the transition period. This positive vision was \r\nreaffirmed at the Paris meeting, where a consensus was \r\nreached on our progress towards democracy and the \r\npeaceful settlement of our problems through elections \r\nrather than armed confrontation — needless to say with \r\nthe exception of the war against terrorism, which must \r\ncontinue — and through the restoration of ourmilitary \r\nand executive institutions.\r\nWith regard to the fight against terrorism, we were \r\nsuccessful in our attempt to liberate the cities of Sirte \r\nand Benghazi, among others, from Da’esh. However, \r\nwe continue to have problems in dealing with the \r\nconsequences of their seizure by terrorist organizations. \r\nWe pay tribute to the memory of the martyrs who have \r\nlaid down their lives to liberate the cities of Libya, \r\nand reiterate the need for a strategic partnership with \r\nall friendly States, especially the United States of \r\nAmerica, which we thank for its support in halting the \r\nacts of these terrorist organizations.\r\nWe must all understand that the fight against \r\nterrorism is not over. There are new hotbeds of tension \r\nand terrorism. Terrorists who have f led Iraq and Syria \r\nhave now come to our country. We ask to be allowed \r\nto rebuild our army so that it can confront them and \r\nprotect our country.\r\nMy country is experiencing other difficulties, \r\nincluding illegal migration. A number of migrants have \r\nentered Libyan territory and used it as a transit country \r\non their way to Europe across the Mediterranean. \r\nLibya suffers from this problem just as other States \r\ndo. It is a burden on our already very limited resources \r\nand has a number of adverse security and economic \r\nconsequences. We also lack the necessary resources \r\nto tackle the armed smuggling networks plaguing our \r\ncountry. We thank all who have helped us to address \r\nwith this problem, especially Italy, which has recently \r\nprovided training assistance in a number of cities. \r\nWe welcome the support provided by France, Italy \r\nand Germany, especially in monitoring our southern \r\nborders, where most illegal migrants cross. We do not \r\npossess the capacity to tackle this problem alone.\r\nAnother issue related to the migrants and \r\nrefugees in Libya is how to pay for the aid they need. \r\nThe Government of National Accord is working to \r\nassist them as much as possible, and we welcome the \r\nhelp we have had from humanitarian organizations, \r\nespecially in the form of shelters. We would like to \r\nreturn these refugees to their homes rather than grant \r\nthem citizenship in our country. Libya participated \r\nwith European States in the Paris summit at which an \r\nagreement emerged aimed at finding political solutions \r\nto restoring stability throughout Libya. It was also \r\nagreed that we need to be provided with the assistance \r\nnecessary to fund development programmes in the \r\nmigrants’ countries of origin.\r\nMy country views human rights as extremely \r\nimportant. Since the 2011 revolution we have adopted a \r\nnumber of laws promoting human rights, but as this is a \r\ntransitional period we are still working to restore State \r\nauthority throughout the country, and that has naturally \r\nhad an impact on the security situation. The Presidency \r\nCouncil is applying the no-impunity principle in order \r\nto gradually enable the law-enforcement agencies to \r\ntake up their necessary functions. We would like to \r\nbenefit from United Nations technical expertise in \r\nthe field of human rights, and we have therefore been \r\ninviting human rights special programmes to visit \r\nLibya since 2012, as was reiterated during the thirty-\r\nfourth session of the Human Rights Council in March.\r\nOne of the crucial current issues for the United \r\nNations is Security Council reform. In that regard, we \r\nwelcomed the Council’s adoption of resolution 2378 \r\n(2017) a couple of days ago. We hope that reform will \r\nhelp us in developing the role of our Organization by, \r\nfor instance, granting a permanent seat on the Security \r\nCouncil to the African continent, in keeping with the \r\nEzulwini Consensus and the Sirte Declaration on the \r\nreform of the United Nations.\r\nThe situation in the Middle East remains an absolute \r\npriority. Despite the crises that we are experiencing, we \r\nhave spared no effort to support the Palestinian people \r\nin their attempts to establish an independent State with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital. We reiterate our support \r\nfor the Arab Peace Initiative to settle the Palestinian \r\nissue, and we urge the world’s major Powers to assume \r\ntheir responsibilities in that regard. We wish to see a \r\npeaceful solution to the crises in Syria and Yemen in \r\norder to protect them from division and collapse as a \r\nresult of the destructive conflicts raging through their \r\ncountries and to fulfil the aspirations of their peoples \r\nin a dignified way that respects human rights and the \r\nrule of law.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for \r\nholding a special meeting on Libya this morning that \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n14/29 17-29407\r\nattracted a great deal of international interest and at \r\nwhich everyone present reaffirmed that the backdrop to \r\nany solution must be a political one. Assistance will be \r\nneeded for the presidential and parliamentary elections \r\nnext year. We ask the Secretary-General and the Special \r\nRepresentative for Libya, Mr. Ghassan Salamé, to \r\npresent us with a timeline and send a clear message to all \r\nwho attempt to hinder the process that there can be no \r\nmilitary solution and that negotiations with authorities \r\nparallel to the Government of National Accord must \r\nstop, as they are in violation of the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. I would like to reiterate our desire \r\nfor all sectors of the Libyan population to be able to \r\nexercise their rights to national self-determination and \r\nlive in a State that enjoys the rule of law.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Presidency Council \r\nof the Government of National Accord of Libya for the \r\nstatement that he has just made.\r\nMr. Faiez Mustafa Serraj, President of the \r\nPresidency Council of the Government of National \r\nAccord of Libya, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of \r\nthe Republic of Nauru\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Nauru.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President \r\nof the Republic of Nauru, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Waqa: It is an honour to be here for the \r\nopening of the seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly. On behalf of the Republic of Nauru, I would \r\nlike to congratulate you, Sir, on your recent assumption \r\nof the presidency of the General Assembly. Please be \r\nassured of my delegation’s full support and cooperation \r\nas you steer its work during this critical session. I would \r\nalso like to thank the outgoing President, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, for his exceptional work.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto express our deepest sorrow and condolences to our \r\nbrothers and sisters who have suffered so much from \r\nthe series of hurricanes in the Caribbean and the United \r\nStates and to our brothers and sisters in Mexico for the \r\ndevastating earthquakes. Their suffering and grief is \r\nshared by us all, and we pray that God will be their \r\nstrength and great provider during their recovery efforts.\r\nThe Government of Nauru shares the international \r\ncommunity’s view that full implementation of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) must be at the \r\ncentre of our work in the coming year. The 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development is a universal agreement \r\nrepresenting our collective priorities, from the largest \r\nto the smallest nations among us. Bringing that same \r\napproach to our implementation effort is the only way \r\nto ensure that no country is left behind.\r\nMembers will recall the five words that guided our \r\nwork on the SDGs — people, planet, prosperity, peace \r\nand partnership — which, I am sure, gave inspiration \r\nto the President’s choice of a theme for this new session \r\nof the General Assembly. Those five words are broad \r\nenough to encompass our collectively held ideals while \r\naccommodating our tremendous diversity. In the case \r\nof Nauru, our status as a small island developing State \r\nunderlies every aspect of the lives of my people.\r\nThe global economic system was not created with \r\nsmall islands in mind. Small size and population, \r\ngeographic isolation, few natural resources and a high \r\nlevel of vulnerability to economic and environmental \r\nshocks are among the characteristics that make small \r\nislands a special case for development. Our people \r\ncrave prosperity just like anyone else. However, the \r\nwell trodden pathways to development are simply not \r\navailable to us.\r\nMore than most, our prospects depend on a stable \r\nplanet, including a safe climate and healthy oceans. \r\nThat is why Nauru was among the first countries in \r\nthe world to ratify the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, and why we have made the implementation \r\nof our national contribution to the Agreement our top \r\npriority. Nearly every country has made that solemn \r\ncommitment, and we are now two years closer to the \r\ntime when we will be held to account.\r\nWith regard to climate action in developing \r\ncountries, implementation is a collective responsibility. \r\nAs developing countries, we have demonstrated our \r\npolitical will to be part of the global effort, but most of us \r\nlack the resources to fully implement our contributions \r\nalone. In that regard, we call on our development \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 15/29\r\npartners to step up their assistance programmes. \r\nNauru’s climate priorities fall into four categories —\r\nrenewable energy, land rehabilitation, water security \r\nand infrastructure-proofing. We are looking to \r\nbuild genuine and durable partnerships to achieve \r\nthose objectives.\r\nWhile the Paris Agreement was a historic diplomatic \r\nachievement, we must remember that we remain well off \r\ntrack for achieving its central goal of keeping warming \r\nbelow 1.5°C. Failure to achieve that goal would be \r\ndevastating for small islands, but we should not pretend \r\nthat any additional warming is safe. Negative impacts \r\nin the form of superstorms, irregular rain patterns and \r\nheatwaves are here with us now and will continue to \r\nget worse for the foreseeable future. As I said at last \r\nyear’s World Humanitarian Summit, all of us must face \r\nup to some very difficult questions. How will we feed a \r\nplanet of 9 billion people when crop yields are projected \r\nto fall? How will we share declining freshwater \r\nresources as glaciers disappear and drought becomes \r\ncommonplace in many regions? How will we protect \r\nthe millions who are rendered homeless when low-lying \r\ncoastal areas are inundated? How can those and many \r\nother challenges be managed effectively so that we can \r\navoid breakdowns in governance and a proliferation of \r\nfailed States?\r\nIt is difficult to see how we can realize our vision \r\nfor a peaceful planet without answers to those questions. \r\nClimate change will be the defining security challenge \r\nof the century, and we are simply not prepared for life \r\non a hotter planet. For that reason, Nauru supports \r\nthe proposal by the Pacific small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) that the United Nations appoint a Special \r\nRepresentative on climate and security, whose work \r\nmust begin with an assessment of the United Nation’s \r\ncapacity to respond to climate disasters.\r\nIn addition to a safe climate, the prosperity of Nauru’s \r\npeople depends on a healthy ocean. In that regard, we \r\nmust show ambition in tackling the mounting threats to \r\nthe health of our oceans. The special case of SIDS needs \r\nto be enshrined in our work across all ocean sectors and \r\nin the new implementing agreements on biodiversity \r\nbeyond national jurisdiction under the United Nations \r\nConvention on the Law of the Sea. Launching and \r\nconcluding an intergovernmental conference to draft a \r\nnew implementing agreement in line with the common \r\nheritage of mankind that would allow for the protection \r\nand preservation of the oceans should be an urgent \r\npriority in that work. The security of our oceans is \r\nanother problem that all of us must tackle.\r\nIllegal, unreported and unregulated fishing is \r\nanother great threat and represents an economic loss to \r\nour small economy. Along with transnational crimes that \r\noccur within our waters and those of our neighbours, it is \r\nan issue that requires cooperation on a number of fronts \r\nthrough inter-agency and intercountry partnerships. \r\nI call on our friends and partners to continue with \r\nexisting programmes, such as the Shiprider Agreement \r\nand other ongoing bilateral cooperation arrangements \r\nnegotiated by the United States, as well as the maritime \r\nsurveillance programmes provided by Australia and \r\nNew Zealand. We look forward to partnering with other \r\nlaw-enforcement agencies throughout the Asia-Pacific \r\nand beyond.\r\nIn order for the people of Nauru to benefit from \r\nthose global efforts to protect the climate and ocean, we \r\nwill have to build genuine and durable partnerships that \r\nare based on mutual respect and a clear understanding \r\nof the real needs on the ground. Too often, small \r\ncountries like mine have been excluded from \r\ninternational programmes. Funding mechanisms can be \r\neffectively impossible to access because the application \r\nand reporting requirements exceed the capacity of our \r\ndomestic institutions. Private investment is unreliable \r\nand rarely available to support the provision of basic \r\nservices and the construction of critical infrastructure. \r\nMeanwhile, the most promising financing models \r\nfor small developing countries, such as direct access \r\nand direct budgetary support, are rarely offered by \r\nour development partners. That must change. We \r\nneed our partners to meet the needs of small and \r\nvulnerable countries.\r\nWe know that we too must become better partners, \r\nwhich is why my country has emphasized the \r\nimportance of capacity-building as a critical component \r\nof our international cooperation. In order for our people \r\nto prosper, we must invest in building their knowledge \r\nand skills. There is no shortage of workshops held in \r\nthe Pacific region. What Nauru needs is a sustained \r\ncapacity-building effort that is backed by real resources, \r\nincluding the long-term, in-country presence of our \r\ndevelopment partners when appropriate, so that we are \r\nleft with strong domestic institutions run by a skilled \r\ndomestic workforce.\r\nI cannot stress the importance of a robust capacity-\r\nbuilding programme enough. As a former schoolteacher, \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n16/29 17-29407\r\nI am passionate about the importance of high-quality \r\neducation for my people. We have our own training \r\nprogrammes for our high school and tertiary students, as \r\nwell as programmes for those already in the workforce. \r\nWe acknowledge the generous support of our friends \r\nand partners, who have provided scholarships and \r\ntechnical workshops that are invaluable to our long-\r\nterm development, particularly in high-priority areas \r\nsuch as the health sector, education, engineering, public \r\nadministration and good governance.\r\nHaving a healthy economy and a productive people \r\nalso requires international relations to be peaceful \r\nand stable, not only in the Pacific but throughout the \r\nworld. With regard to the Pacific region, Nauru calls \r\non the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to enter \r\ninto dialogue with the other countries involved in the \r\ndispute on the Korean peninsula. The threats made \r\nagainst the Republic of Korea, Japan, Guam and cities \r\nof the United States do not help the situation, and they \r\npotentially put many small countries in the Pacific, \r\nincluding Nauru, in the line of fire. That is completely \r\nunacceptable, and the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea must stop such threats, including the launching \r\nof rockets into the Pacific Ocean.\r\nFurther to the south, we have in Taiwan a State \r\nthat is peaceful, prosperous and happy. Taiwan has \r\nthe technical and financial capacity to contribute to \r\nworld peace and development, particularly where its \r\ntechnical prowess and know-how are concerned. It \r\nwishes to contribute and participate freely through \r\nthe partnerships and activities of the United Nations \r\nsystem, including the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, the World Health Organization, UNESCO, the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange and other United Nations-related agencies and \r\nactivities. In order to ensure that the Taiwanese people \r\ncan make positive contributions to societies around \r\nthe world, they must be given the freedom to travel \r\nwhere they choose. We are, after all, a world that calls \r\nfor inclusiveness and for no one to be left behind. In \r\nthat same spirit, Nauru renews its call for an end to the \r\neconomic, commercial and financial blockade imposed \r\nby the United States on Cuba.\r\nThe phrase “people, planet, prosperity, peace, \r\nand partnership” elegantly captures the scope of our \r\nwork over the coming year and beyond. However, \r\nthere is another word that begins with P that we must \r\nnot ignore. That word is power. Power will determine \r\nwhether resources are mobilized for people or for \r\nprofiteering. Power will determine whether the voices \r\nof the marginalized are heard. Power will determine \r\nwhether we leave a healthy and bountiful planet for \r\nfuture generations. To ignore the role of power in \r\nshaping our future is to cede what little power we may \r\nhave. If we are to achieve our ambitious goals for a \r\npeaceful, prosperous and sustainable planet, we will \r\nhave to grapple with power as it actually exists in the \r\nworld, including all of its inequities and perversities. \r\nThat will undoubtedly be the most difficult aspect of \r\nthe task before us.\r\nIn closing, I would like to thank the Governments \r\nof Australia, Taiwan, New Zealand, Japan, India, the \r\nRussian Federation, the European Union, Italy, Israel, \r\nCuba, the Republic of Korea and the United States for \r\ntheir continued support and assistance to Nauru. We \r\nvalue their friendship very much, and we look forward \r\nto their continued cooperation and support.\r\nAlong those lines, I would like to make a special \r\nacknowledgement to the United Nations for the support \r\nit provided to Nauru nearly 50 years ago, leading to our \r\nindependence. On 31 January 2018, we will celebrate \r\nour golden jubilee as a sovereign and democratic \r\nnation. I would also like to thank all the countries that \r\nsupported us in exercising our self-determination and \r\nachieving our independence.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Nauru \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Baron Divavesi Waqa, President of the \r\nRepublic of Nauru, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Henry Van Thio, Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of the Union of Myanmar\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Vice-President of the Republic of the \r\nUnion of Myanmar.\r\nMr. Henry Van Thio, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of the Union of Myanmar, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Henry Van Thio, Vice-President \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 17/29\r\nof the Republic of the Union of Myanmar, and inviting \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Van Thio (Myanmar): I would like to \r\ncongratulate you, Sir, on your election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nWe are confident that under your able leadership, this \r\nyear’s session will be fruitful.\r\nBefore I go into the substance of my statement, \r\nI would like to take the opportunity to express my \r\ndeepest sympathy to the Government and the people of \r\nMexico for the loss of life and property caused by the \r\ndeadly earthquake that hit Mexico City.\r\nI also wish to convey our profound sympathy to the \r\nGovernments and the peoples of the United States and \r\nStates of the Caribbean, which have experienced the \r\nhorrendous consequences of consecutive hurricanes in \r\na short span of two weeks. Our sympathies also go to \r\nthe people of Puerto Rico, who are still reeling from the \r\neffects of Hurricane Maria. The intensity and frequency \r\nof such natural disasters are evidence of climate \r\nchange, now becoming a reality that poses a serious \r\nthreat to our planet. Its impacts are global in scope and \r\nunprecedented in scale. Myanmar is highly vulnerable \r\nto the negative effects of climate change, so as a country \r\nfrequently affected by storms, f loods and droughts we \r\nwelcome the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nI am pleased to inform the Assembly that yesterday \r\nMyanmar deposited with the Secretary-General its \r\ninstruments of ratification of the Paris Agreement and \r\nthe Doha Amendment to the Kyoto Protocol.\r\nWe welcome the current session’s theme, “Focusing \r\non people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on \r\na sustainable planet”. Peace and stability are something \r\nthat we are striving to achieve in Myanmar after nearly \r\nseven decades of civil strife and conflict.\r\nLast year, from this rostrum, our State Counsellor, \r\nMs. Aung San Suu Kyi, set out our Government’s \r\nvision for ending decades of internal armed conflict \r\nin Myanmar and finding lasting and meaningful \r\nsolutions to the complex situation in Rakhine state (see \r\nA/71/PV.11). Today, one year later, I am here to apprise \r\nthe Assembly of the progress that we have made and the \r\nremaining challenges that lie before us. Given that the \r\nsituation in Rakhine state has understandably been the \r\nfocus of the world’s attention in recent weeks, let me \r\nstart by addressing that issue.\r\nYesterday, the State Counsellor briefed the \r\ndiplomatic corps in Myanmar on the Government’s \r\nefforts to promote national reconciliation and peace. \r\nShe highlighted the achievements of the past 18 months \r\nand the challenges that remain. With respect to the \r\nsituation in Rakhine, she said that Myanmar shares \r\nthe concern of the international community regarding \r\nthe displacement and suffering experienced by all \r\ncommunities affected by the latest round of terrorist \r\nattacks. She also stressed that:\r\n“We condemn all human rights violations \r\nand unlawful violence. We are committed to the \r\nrestoration of peace, stability and the rule of law \r\nthroughout Rakhine state. The security forces \r\nhave been instructed to adhere strictly to the code \r\nof conduct in carrying out security operations, to \r\nexercise all due restraint and to take full measures \r\nto avoid collateral damage and the harming of \r\ninnocent civilians. Human rights violations and \r\nall other acts that impair stability and harmony \r\nand undermine the rule of law will be addressed \r\nin accordance with strict norms of justice. We feel \r\ndeeply for the suffering of all of the people who \r\nhave been caught up in the conflict.”\r\nThe situation in Rakhine has been one of the top \r\npriorities of the Government since it assumed office. \r\nThe Government has been endeavouring to restore \r\npeace and stability and to promote harmony among \r\nall communities. The Central Committee on the \r\nImplementation of Peace, Stability and Development of \r\nRakhine State, chaired by the State Counsellor herself, \r\nwas established on 30 May 2016 to address that state’s \r\nspecific needs. Additionally, in August 2016, she set \r\nup an advisory commission, headed by former United \r\nNations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, to advise the \r\nGovernment on sustainable solutions to the complex \r\nsituation there.\r\nWe have been striving to ensure that Rakhine \r\nstate is duly developed while ensuring peace, stability \r\nand societal cohesion. That is no easy task. The deep \r\nmistrust that has developed over decades has to be \r\nslowly chiselled away. On 24 August, the Annan \r\nAdvisory Commission released its final report. Our \r\nGovernment welcomed it immediately.\r\nWe had hoped that today would be an opportunity \r\nfor us to communicate to the world the progress that \r\nwe have made towards implementing the Advisory \r\nCommission’s recommendations. It is, therefore, with \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n18/29 17-29407\r\ndeep regret that I must instead primarily address the \r\nAssembly on the current state of affairs in Rakhine \r\nstate following the recent attacks by the terrorist \r\ngroup known as the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army \r\n(ARSA) last month.\r\nAs the General Assembly is aware, within hours \r\nof the release of the Advisory Commission’s report, a \r\nseries of coordinated attacks were carried out against \r\n30 police outposts in northern Rakhine. The ARSA \r\nclaimed responsibility for the attacks. Those attacks \r\nignited fresh violence in the region, resulting in \r\nsignificant loss of life, widespread suffering and the \r\nmass displacement of many communities. Many have \r\nhad to abandon their hearths and homes — not just \r\nMuslim and Rakhine, but also other small minority \r\ngroups, such as Daing-net, Mro, Thet, Mramagyi and \r\nHindus. Most of the world has been oblivious to their \r\nexistence and plight.\r\nLet me be clear. The Government of Myanmar \r\nis extremely concerned about the present situation in \r\nRakhine state. Our deepest sympathy goes to the families \r\nof all innocent civilians and members of the police and \r\nsecurity forces who have lost their lives. There is no \r\ndenying that this is a problem of significant magnitude.\r\nI am happy to inform the Assembly that the situation \r\nhas improved. No armed clashes have been reported \r\nsince 5 September. Accordingly, we are concerned \r\nabout reports that the f low of Muslims crossing into \r\nBangladesh remains unabated. We would need to find \r\nout the reason for that exodus. What is known is that the \r\ngreat majority of the Muslim population have decided \r\nto remain in their villages.\r\nWe share the need to ensure that vital humanitarian \r\nassistance is provided to all those in need. Moreover, we \r\nacknowledge that the duty to respond to the challenges \r\nin Rakhine state is first and foremost the duty of \r\nour national Government. The situation in Rakhine \r\nis complex. The challenges we face are significant. \r\nAccordingly, we have adopted an integrated national \r\nstrategy to address the problem.\r\nI am pleased to announce the launch of a committee \r\nchaired by the Union Minister of Social Welfare, Relief \r\nand Resettlement to implement the recommendations of \r\nthe Advisory Commission. To ensure transparency and \r\naccountability, the committee is mandated to publicly \r\nissue a progress report every four months. In addition \r\nto the committee, we intend to establish an advisory \r\nboard made up of eminent persons from both Myanmar \r\nand abroad.\r\nAt present, humanitarian assistance is our first \r\npriority. We are committed to ensuring that aid is \r\nreceived by all those in need, without discrimination. \r\nWe have already dedicated significant national funds \r\nand resources to humanitarian relief operations. I \r\nam also pleased to inform the Assembly that a new \r\nGovernment-led mechanism, established in cooperation \r\nwith the Red Cross Movement, has also started its \r\nhumanitarian assistance activities.\r\nOn behalf of the Government of Myanmar, I would \r\nlike to express my gratitude to all those countries that \r\nhave offered to contribute to that assistance programme. \r\nIn particular, we are grateful for the generous offers \r\nof support that we have received recently from many \r\nof our friends across the world. At the same time, \r\nwe are working hard to strengthen relations with \r\nBangladesh. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs \r\nand the National Security Advisor visited Bangladesh \r\nin January and July. We were hoping for a visit from the \r\nHome Affairs Minister of Bangladesh, but it had to be \r\npostponed, as the Minister could not come in August. \r\nWe will welcome him whenever he is able to come \r\nand hope to take forward our cooperation on border \r\nsecurity matters.\r\nThere has been a call for the repatriation of the \r\ndisplaced people who have recently f led from northern \r\nRakhine to Bangladesh. In her statement yesterday, \r\nthe State Counsellor said that Myanmar was prepared \r\nto start the verification process at any time. Our two \r\nneighbours had experience with such a process in 1993, \r\nthrough the establishment of a joint working group \r\nfor implementing the repatriation process, and we can \r\ndevelop a process based on that experience.\r\nMyanmar stands together with the rest of the \r\nworld in condemning terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations. Terrorism constitutes one of the most \r\nserious threats to international peace and security, and \r\nour position is clear. We cannot condone terrorism. At \r\nthe same time, the Government is working to ensure \r\nthat acts of terrorism will not distract us from pursuing \r\nthe long-term strategy that is necessary in order to \r\naddress the complex challenges in Rakhine state today. \r\nThe recommendations of the Advisory Commission on \r\nRakhine state provide us with a clear road map. Our \r\nimplementation committee began its work last week, \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 19/29\r\nand we will be inviting observers to witness some of \r\nour programmes in due course.\r\nThe recent events in Rakhine state are a painful \r\nreminder that we face difficult challenges ahead on \r\nthe long journey to peace, prosperity and democracy. \r\nHowever, I would like to reiterate that our commitment \r\nto peace remains as strong and as unwavering today as \r\nit was a year ago, when our State Counsellor, Aung San \r\nSuu Kyi, first addressed the General Assembly from \r\nthis rostrum. As part of that commitment, we have made \r\nthe national reconciliation and peace process our top \r\npriority. Our vision here is clear — we want to achieve \r\na democratic, federal union, based on the principles of \r\nfreedom, justice, equal rights and self-determination.\r\nWith regard to the peace process in Myanmar, I \r\nam pleased to inform you that in May we successfully \r\nheld the second session of our Union Peace Conference. \r\nFor the first time, we were able to discuss and define \r\nkey principles that will form the basis of a federal, \r\ndemocratic Union. The Union Accord, consisting of 37 \r\nprinciples covering the political, economic, social and \r\nenvironmental sectors, was signed by representatives \r\nof the Government, the Parliament, the military, ethnic \r\narmed organizations and political parties.\r\nMr. Barros Melet (Chile), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAlthough we have made real progress, we know that \r\nthe road ahead is long and convoluted. Our democratic \r\ntransition is fragile. At this important juncture in our \r\nnation’s history, we only ask that the international \r\ncommunity continue to support our efforts to achieve \r\npeace, prosperity and democracy.\r\nI would like to conclude by reaffirming Myanmar’s \r\nfaith and confidence in the purposes and principles of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. I would also like to \r\nemphasize our firm commitment to a world in which \r\npeace and harmony prevails.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nVice-President of the Republic of the Union of Myanmar \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Henry Van Thio, Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof the Union of Myanmar, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the State of Kuwait.\r\nSheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al Sabah, \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait, was escorted \r\nto the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Highness Sheikh \r\nJaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad Al Sabah, Prime Minister \r\nof the State of Kuwait, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nSheikh Al Sabah (Kuwait) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the Government and the President of the State \r\nof Kuwait, allow me at the outset to extend our sincere \r\ncongratulations to the President and his friendly country, \r\nthe Republic of Slovakia, on his election to preside over \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I \r\nwould also like to assure him of my country’s support \r\nand of our desire to facilitate his work and fulfilment \r\nof his responsibilities. We are fully confident that his \r\ngreat experience in international affairs will contribute \r\nto the conduct of the session’s work.\r\nFurthermore, I would like to avail myself of this \r\nopportunity to express my sincere appreciation for \r\nthe outstanding work of his predecessor, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, during his capable and successful presidency \r\nof the previous session. I would also like to take this \r\nopportunity to congratulate Mr. António Guterres on \r\nthe deserved trust that the international community \r\nhas placed in him and his friendly country of Portugal \r\nwith his appointment as the new Secretary-General. We \r\nwould like to wish him success in serving the purposes \r\nand principles of the Charter of the United Nations, as \r\nwell as in his efforts to strengthen peaceful coexistence \r\namong nations, maintain international peace and \r\nsecurity and reinforce international cooperation in all \r\nfields, including the follow-up to and implementation of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and targets.\r\nIn that connection, we would like to say that \r\nwe value the vital and effective role played by his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, over the past 10 years, \r\nand the great achievements accomplished during his \r\ntenure, such as the Paris Agreement under the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the adoption of the SDGs, among others.\r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n20/29 17-29407\r\nThe State of Kuwait firmly believes in the vital \r\nand effective role played by the United Nations and its \r\nvarious bodies, agencies and programmes in addressing \r\nthe increasing global challenges and risks. We welcome \r\nthe proposals and plans put forward by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral to restructure the Secretariat so as to make it \r\nmore coherent, promote its effectiveness, and ensure the \r\ncohesion and coherence of its activities in maintaining \r\ninternational peace and security and the follow-up to \r\nand the implementation of the SDGs.\r\nWe renew our call with regard to the need to reform \r\nthe Security Council so as to reflect new international \r\nrealities in a manner that can reinforce its credibility and \r\nlegality and ensure a permanent Arab representation on \r\nthe Council, commensurate with the number of Arab \r\nStates and their contribution to supporting the various \r\nactivities of the United Nations.\r\nWe are concerned about the challenges and risks \r\nthat have arisen in various regions of the world, such \r\nas the spread of violence, extremism and terrorism, \r\nas well as the risk of the proliferation of weapons of \r\nmass destruction and the threat of their use. We also \r\ndeplore violations of human rights such as those of the \r\nRohingya Muslim minority in Myanmar. We call for \r\nall acts of oppression against them to end immediately. \r\nThey must be granted the right to citizenship and a \r\ndecent life.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has a firm and principled position \r\nwhen it comes to condemning terrorism in all of its \r\nforms and manifestations. We support all international \r\nmeasures to combat terrorism and eliminate terrorist \r\norganizations. Kuwait also contributes significantly to \r\nthe provision of logistical support to the international \r\nalliance against extremist groups.\r\nIt is regrettable that for multiple reasons the Middle \r\nEast region has the lion’s share of such extremist \r\nchallenges in various forms. We therefore need \r\nconcerted international efforts to deal with them, and \r\nwe must concentrate on addressing their root causes \r\nso that the world can enjoy security and stability. \r\nSuch challenges and risks threaten the very essence of \r\ninternational peace and security, with the majority of \r\nvictims being innocent civilians.\r\nOur brother Republic of Iraq is facing significant \r\nsecurity, political and economic challenges, the most \r\nprominent of which is combating terrorist organizations \r\nand extremist groups. In that respect, we congratulate \r\nthe Government and the people of Iraq on the victories \r\nthat its forces have achieved on the ground in battling \r\nthe Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and on \r\ntheir successful liberation of numerous areas previously \r\nunder the control of ISIL. We hope that such victories \r\ncontinue until the remaining areas still under ISIL’s \r\ncontrol are entirely liberated. We hope that they can \r\ncontribute to national reconciliation efforts among \r\nthe various elements of the Iraqi people, leading to \r\nthe restoration of peace and stability in Iraq and the \r\nmaintenance of its unity, independence and territorial \r\nintegrity, while creating an appropriate environment for \r\nlaunching the process of reconstruction and ensuring \r\nthe return of refugees to their homes.\r\nIn that context, and in response to the calls \r\nfor humanitarian and development assistance, the \r\nState of Kuwait, in cooperation with Iraq and the \r\ninternational community, will host an international \r\ndonors conference in the coming year to rebuild the \r\nareas devastated by ISIL. We renew our commitment \r\nto providing all possible forms of support to help Iraq \r\nfulfil its remaining obligations under the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions so as to regain its regional \r\nand international role and standing.\r\nThis year marks 50 years since the occupation \r\nof Palestinian territories began in 1967. It is the only \r\nArab cause that has been the subject of endless United \r\nNations resolutions and international and regional \r\ninitiatives only to see none of them implemented, owing \r\nto the intransigence of the occupying Power, Israel, and \r\nits explicit and blatant refusal to implement Security \r\nCouncil resolutions of international legitimacy. The \r\nmost recent is resolution 2334 (2016), which stressed \r\nthat the Israeli settlement activities are illegal and \r\nillegitimate and called for them to cease, as they \r\nundermine the prospects of reaching a just, lasting and \r\ncomprehensive peace.\r\nThe State of Kuwait stresses its condemnation of \r\nthe Israeli violations that occurred recently at Al-Haram \r\nAl-Sharif in Jerusalem in a new attempt to alter its \r\nhistorical status. We categorically reject all illegal \r\nIsraeli policies, plans and practices aimed at Judaizing \r\nthe Holy City, erasing its Arab identity, disrupting \r\nits demographic structure and isolating it from its \r\nPalestinian perimeter. Such violations represent a \r\nf lagrant threat to international peace and security and \r\nrun counter to the relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nand the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 21/29\r\nWe therefore appeal to the international community \r\nand the Security Council to honour their responsibilities \r\nand continue pressuring Israel to implement the \r\nresolutions of international legitimacy, allowing the \r\nPalestinian people to gain their legitimate political \r\nrights and the recognition of their own independent \r\nState over their own territory, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital and based on the borders of 4 June 1967, in \r\naccordance with the principle of land for peace and the \r\nArab Peace Initiative.\r\nIt is deplorable that since the onset of the crisis in \r\nSyria, we have seen horrifying actions in that ongoing \r\nconflict, confirming that destruction is its main theme. \r\nIts economic, social and humanitarian impact has yet \r\nto be evaluated or calculated, but it will, unfortunately, \r\ncontribute to the loss of an entire generation of our \r\nbrothers in Syria. The death toll of the conflict has \r\nexceeded 400,000 and nearly 12 million Syrians are \r\neither displaced or refugees, in addition to the massive \r\ndestruction of property and infrastructure that has \r\noccurred in the majority of Syria’s provinces.\r\nWe estimate my country’s voluntary contributions \r\nat various conferences to be $1.6 billion, the bulk of \r\nwhich has been given to specialized United Nations \r\nagencies and intergovernmental and non-governmental \r\norganizations dealing with humanitarian affairs. \r\nDespite the political and humanitarian efforts aimed at \r\ncurbing the conflict in Syria, the reality on the ground \r\nremains unchanged, making it clearer than ever that the \r\nconviction and position that we have advocated from \r\nthe beginning — that the crisis cannot be resolved by \r\nmilitary means — is correct.\r\nThe pace of the political track is still slow. Since \r\nthe issuance of the communiqué of the Geneva \r\nConference on Syria (A/66/865, annex), whose content \r\nhas led to sharp differences over its interpretation, we \r\nhave witnessed seven rounds of Syrian talks in Geneva \r\namong the various parties over a period of five years, \r\nwithout any significant progress. We must, therefore, \r\nintensify our efforts to bring together the parties to \r\nthe conflict, so that they can hold direct talks aimed \r\nat finding a peaceful settlement in accordance with \r\nthe provisions of Security Council resolution 2254 \r\n(2015). Such talks should lead to the creation of a \r\npolitical situation that is able to maintain the unity, \r\nindependence and sovereignty of Syria and meet the \r\nlegitimate aspirations of the Syrian people.\r\nWe reaffirm our full commitment to the unity of \r\nYemen and respect for its sovereignty and independence. \r\nWe reject any interference in its internal affairs and \r\nstress our support and backing of constitutional \r\nlegitimacy in Yemen. A political solution in Yemen \r\nshould be based on the three agreed actions — in other \r\nwords, the initiative of the Gulf Cooperation Council \r\ncountries and its Implementation Mechanism, the \r\noutcome of the national dialogue and the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions, in particular resolution \r\n2216 (2015). The State of Kuwait has made significant \r\nefforts to peacefully resolve the conflict in Yemen. Last \r\nyear, over a period of three months, we hosted political \r\nconsultations between the Yemeni parties under the \r\nauspices of the United Nations aimed at restoring \r\nstability in that brother country. In that regard, we \r\nreiterate our readiness to host our Yemeni brethren for \r\nthe signing of a final accord reached among them.\r\nWe renew our support for the efforts of the United \r\nNations and the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Yemen aimed at reaching a peaceful \r\nsettlement to that crisis, thereby ending the suffering of \r\nthe Yemeni people, who are facing dire humanitarian \r\nand economic conditions. We believe that the optimal \r\nsolution for addressing those humanitarian conditions \r\nrequires the restoration of peace and stability in Yemen \r\nin a manner that would preserve its sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nAt the regional level and within the framework of \r\nthe efforts undertaken by Kuwait to consolidate the \r\nfoundations of good neighbourly relations, we renew \r\nour call to the Islamic Republic of Iran to take serious \r\nconfidence-building measures and establish relations \r\nbased on reciprocal cooperation, mutual respect, \r\ncommon interests and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of States. We also call on it to renounce practices \r\nthat jeopardize the security and stability of the region \r\nand contradict the principles of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and international law, and to adhere \r\nto the resolutions of international legitimacy. Such \r\nmeasures would enable us to direct our efforts towards \r\nreconstruction and development, so that all the peoples \r\nof the region can enjoy security, peace and well-being.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nfaces major challenges, thanks to erroneous behaviour \r\non the part of human beings over the years and the \r\nimpact of natural disasters and greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions — challenges that only increase our \r\ninternational responsibility. It is therefore incumbent \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n22/29 17-29407\r\non us to do our utmost to fully implement the 2030 \r\nAgenda. To that end, we must enhance the mechanisms \r\nof development partnerships in order to keep pace with \r\nthe needs and requirements of sustainable development. \r\nBy doing that, we will be able to fulfil our international \r\ncommitments and show our solidarity at the global level. \r\nThat would constitute a real start towards reaching the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with a view to \r\neliminating every form of poverty. In the context of the \r\nhistoric Paris Agreement on Climate Change, we must \r\naddress the impact of climate change, as it represents \r\none of the biggest impediments to achieving the SDGs, \r\nand we must do so by following the principle of shared \r\nbut differentiated responsibility.\r\nThe State of Kuwait is steadily forging ahead \r\nunder the leadership of His Highness Sheikh Sabah \r\nAl-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of the State of \r\nKuwait, as we work to implement the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development by mainstreaming its goals in \r\nKuwaiti national development plans and programmes, \r\nwith the participation of all sectors of civil society \r\nand all partners. My country’s development plan, the \r\nNew Kuwait 2035 strategy, contains seven basic pillars \r\nthat aim to transform Kuwait into a leading regional \r\nfinancial, commercial, cultural and institutional hub.\r\nThe State of Kuwait has consistently shouldered \r\nits regional and international responsibilities with a \r\nview to achieving development in its various economic, \r\nsocial and environmental dimensions. We have come \r\na long way along the path of implementing the noble \r\ninitiatives of His Highness the Amir aimed at advancing \r\ninternational partnerships and reinforcing Kuwait’s \r\nprevious humanitarian and development efforts.\r\nBefore I conclude my statement, I would like to \r\nexpress the gratitude of the Government and the people \r\nof the State of Kuwait for the trust that those present \r\nplaced in my country during the elections held in June by \r\nelecting it as a non-permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil for the period 2018-2019. Almost 40 years \r\nafter Kuwait’s first non-permanent membership in the \r\nSecurity Council from 1978 to 1979, we return today to \r\nrenew our commitment to strengthening the role of the \r\nSecurity Council in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security, the prevention of conflicts and the \r\nsupport of mediation efforts and endeavours for the \r\npeaceful settlement of conflicts.\r\nWe are also committed to supporting efforts to \r\nmake the Council more transparent and promote the \r\nparticipation of small States in the work of the United \r\nNations and its bodies. We will strive to support and \r\nactivate the international response to the refugee \r\nand immigrant crises and all other humanitarian \r\ncrises resulting from wars and conflicts, which have \r\nintensified in recent years, while hoping that peace and \r\nsecurity prevail all over the world.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the State of Kuwait for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nHis Highness Sheikh Jaber Al-Mubarak Al-Hamad \r\nAl Sabah, Prime Minister of the State of Kuwait, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Josaia Voreqe \r\nBainimarama, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Fiji\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Fiji.\r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Fiji, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Josaia Voreqe \r\nBainimarama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Fiji, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Bainimarama (Fiji): I want to begin by \r\ncongratulating Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on assuming the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session and by wishing him every success in the \r\nupcoming year.\r\nAs we all know, the global community faces a great \r\nnumber of challenges, of which climate change is only \r\none. But I am sure that we all want to send a message \r\nof solidarity and sympathy tonight to the millions of \r\npeople in the Caribbean who are suffering from the \r\nravages of Hurricane Maria. It is an especially cruel \r\nordeal so soon after Hurricane Irma paved a path of \r\ndestruction through the Caribbean and the southern \r\npart of the United States. Our thoughts and prayers are \r\nwith those who have been affected.\r\nThe Fijian people share a special sense of solidarity \r\nwith those who have lost either loved ones or their \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 23/29\r\nhomes and possessions in such events. Last year, we lost \r\n44 of our own people and a third of our gross domestic \r\nproduct when Fiji was struck by the biggest cyclone in \r\nits history. So, as the incoming President of the twenty-\r\nthird session of the Conference of the Parties to the \r\nUnited Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange (COP-23), I am deeply conscious of the need to \r\nlead a global response to the underlying causes of such \r\nevents. The appalling suffering in the Caribbean and \r\nthe United States reminds us all that there is no time \r\nto waste.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to the new \r\nPresident’s predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, the \r\nfirst Fijian to occupy the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly. Ambassador Thomson carried out his role \r\nwith great distinction, and I especially want to thank \r\nhim for the role he has played in bringing the parlous \r\nstate of our oceans to global attention. The Ocean \r\nConference that Fiji co-hosted with Sweden in June \r\nwas an unqualified success. As a global community, we \r\nhave begun the massive task of restoring the health of \r\nour oceans and tackling the overfishing that is stripping \r\nthem of marine life and depriving millions of people of \r\na precious resource, now and in the future. I salute the \r\nUnited Nations for appointing Ambassador Thomson as \r\nSpecial Envoy for the Ocean. It is an honour for Fiji to \r\nhave one of our own leading an effort that is so vital to \r\nensuring the implementation of a crucial Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal.\r\nNext year will mark the fortieth anniversary of \r\nFiji’s contribution to United Nations peacekeeping. As a \r\nsmall nation, we have suffered a great deal of pain from \r\nthe loss of some of our finest troops on peacekeeping \r\nduties over the years. But our contribution is a very \r\nimportant part of how we see ourselves as a nation, \r\nwith our men and women in uniform serving the global \r\ncommunity by protecting ordinary people in troubled \r\nparts of the world. For 40 years, we have helped make \r\nthe world more secure. And now we are determined to \r\nmake a successful contribution to the wider security of \r\nthe planet through our leadership of COP-23.\r\nThere is no escaping the fact that climate change \r\nis as great a threat to global security as any conflict. \r\nMillions of people are already on the move because of \r\ndrought and the changes to agriculture that threaten \r\ntheir food security. History has taught us that human \r\nbeings will always fight over access to water. Unless \r\nwe tackle the underlying causes of climate change, we \r\nalready know that some places will become unlivable \r\nand others will disappear altogether. In my own region, \r\nthree of our neighbours are at risk, which is why Fiji \r\nhas offered to give refuge to the people of Kiribati and \r\nTuvalu in the event of a worst-case scenario in which \r\ntheir homes sink beneath the waves.\r\nFor the Fijian people, climate change is real. It \r\naffects our lives in every way. The entire villages that \r\nwe are moving out of the way of rising seas, the loss of \r\nour ancestral burial grounds, the salinity affecting our \r\ncrops and the constant threat of destruction to homes \r\nand infrastructure of the kind that we experienced last \r\nyear are all evidence of that. The reason that our hearts \r\ngo out to the people of the Caribbean right now is not \r\nonly because we can empathize with them but because \r\nwe fear the same fate. I implore the nations of the world \r\nto imagine a third of their gross domestic product being \r\ndestroyed in the space of a year or so. Imagine another \r\ncyclone scoring a direct hit and wiping out decades \r\nof development.\r\nIt is clear that global warming changes our very \r\nunderstanding of what our national interests are. It \r\nchallenges us to understand that the only way for every \r\nnation to put itself first is to lock arms with every \r\nother nation and move forward together. Anything else \r\nis self-destructive for the world and for each nation. \r\nIt may be tempting for political leaders to show that \r\nthey are protecting some national industry or near-\r\nterm economic goal, but we must ask at what cost. \r\nWise leaders must work hard to convince their peoples \r\nto embrace the path that we know that we must take. \r\nThere is no choice to be made between prosperity \r\nand a healthy climate, for how prosperous can we be \r\nif we must devote our resources to relocating entire \r\npopulations or reinforcing major cities? How much \r\ndoes it cost to find new places to farm? What will the \r\nconsequences be for global and regional security if \r\nnations begin to compete for safe land or have conflicts \r\nover the movements of climate refugees? It is obvious \r\nthat we need to cooperate.\r\nWe need to learn from each other and use the \r\nworld’s considerable resources to do the greatest \r\npossible amount of good for the greatest possible \r\nnumber of people. We need to continue to create \r\nprosperity and ensure the well-being of the nations \r\nand ecosystems of the world. If we view the process as \r\nsome sort of negotiation in which each country tries to \r\npreserve its narrow national interests, we will all lose. \r\nWe will be powerless to protect our own people from \r\nthe consequences of climate change. Collective action \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n24/29 17-29407\r\nis the only way forward. Wise men and women will \r\nunderstand that.\r\nThat is why I took on the role of President of COP-\r\n23 and why I have eagerly embraced the opportunity to \r\nbe the first Pacific Islander to do so. It is about ensuring \r\nthat my own people f lourish and prosper, now and in \r\nthe future. By collaborating with the other nations \r\nof the world through the process, we will ensure that \r\ntogether, humankind can f lourish and prosper. Morocco \r\nwill pass the ball to me and the Fijian team in Bonn \r\nin November, and we thank the Moroccan presidency \r\nof COP-22 for making such great strides towards the \r\ngoal of fully implementing the Paris Climate Change \r\nAgreement. Next year, Fiji will pass the ball to Poland. \r\nI want to assure the Polish presidency of COP-24 that \r\nFiji will be supporting it throughout the entire process.\r\nOur own presidency would not be possible without \r\nGermany’s wonderful assistance. We simply could not \r\nhave staged an event of such size and complexity in Fiji. \r\nOut of necessity, we have forged a bond with Germany \r\nthat is an example to the world of how countries at \r\nopposite ends of the Earth and of vastly different means \r\nand size can work effectively for a common goal. We \r\ndid it with Sweden at the Ocean Conference in June, \r\nand we are equally proud to stand shoulder to shoulder \r\nwith Germany to deliver on the goals that the Paris \r\nAgreement has outlined.\r\nFiji is deeply conscious that Governments alone \r\ncannot overcome the challenge at hand. That is why \r\nwe are placing such emphasis on the notion of a grand \r\ncoalition of Governments at every level with civil \r\nsociety, the private sector and ordinary citizens moving \r\nthe agenda forward. I am reaching out to governors, \r\nmayors and leaders of every sort across our societies, \r\npeople of faith, people on the front line in the climate \r\nstruggle, women and the young people who represent \r\nour future. We are going to do things differently in \r\nBonn. The formal proceedings will be led by our chief \r\nnegotiator, Ambassador Nazhat Shameem Khan, and \r\nI will play a roving role. I will be on hand to resolve \r\nany difficulties that arise in the formal negotiations. In \r\norder to reflect the importance of our grand coalition, I \r\nwill be travelling between the two zones in Bonn, that \r\nof the formal negotiations and the climate action zone, \r\nalong with my good friend and our climate champion, \r\nMr. Inia Seruiratu, as well as my fellow Pacific leaders. \r\nI am counting on them to help me get the message \r\nacross that only by working together can we move the \r\nprocess faster and further.\r\nIn the climate action zone — the Bonn zone — Fiji \r\nand Germany are bringing together all those who have \r\na part to play in making our grand coalition a great \r\ntransformation, including climate activists, companies \r\nat the cutting edge of technology, artists, creative \r\npeople, dancers and performers. We will be stamping \r\nthe zone with the Fijian bula spirit of optimism \r\nand inclusiveness that has made our islands famous \r\nthroughout the world. In the formal Bula zone, we \r\nwant the nations of the world to embrace what we in \r\nFiji and some other Pacific countries call the spirit \r\nof talanoa, characterized by dialogue based on trust, \r\nempathy and the collective good. In our experience, \r\nit is the best way of getting things done, especially in \r\ndifficult circumstances. It embodies engagement that is \r\nrespectful, honest and cooperative and acknowledges \r\nthat none of us, no matter how powerful, can solve \r\nthe climate challenge on our own. For humankind to \r\nsurvive, f lourish and prosper, we have no alternative \r\nbut to cooperate.\r\nWe have already established a solid foundation for \r\nour efforts in the presidency. The formal negotiations are \r\nprogressing, and we are looking forward to welcoming \r\nministers and their delegations and representatives \r\nof civil society to Fiji next month for our pre-COP \r\nmeeting. We are already delighted to see the energy and \r\nsense of purpose of the leaders in our grand coalition. \r\nI am especially grateful to Governor Jerry Brown \r\nof California, whom I have appointed to help me as \r\nSpecial Envoy for States and Regions and who heads \r\nan impressive list of political leaders around the world \r\nwho are part of the Under2 Coalition. As we all know, \r\nthe Paris Agreement calls for global warming to be kept \r\nwell under 2°C above the average temperature of the \r\nindustrial age and as close as possible to 1.5°C.\r\nA year ago I stood here, before my appointment \r\nas President of COP-23, and called for 1.5°C to be our \r\ntarget (see A/71/PV.8). I meant it then and I mean it \r\nnow. Fixing that number as our objective is urgent, and \r\nwe must do it as soon as possible. I certainly carry with \r\nme the authority of the Pacific to pursue that objective, \r\nand at this point I would like to pay heartfelt tribute to \r\na Pacific islander whom we have just lost but whose \r\nlegacy will live on in these negotiations. Two years \r\nago, Tony deBrum of the Marshall Islands took a very \r\npowerful slogan to Paris — “One point five to stay \r\nalive”. We intend to honour Tony’s legacy, and I intend \r\nto draw on his spirit during my presidency.\r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 25/29\r\nIn addition to ensuring decisive action to limit \r\nglobal warming, we must also do a lot more to make \r\nnations and communities more resilient where the \r\neffects of climate change are concerned. We know that \r\nwe are all going to have to adapt. But we must make \r\nspecial provision for those who are most vulnerable \r\nand have the fewest resources for coping with the \r\ncatastrophic consequences we are witnessing all around \r\nus. We are pleased to be part of a serious engagement \r\nwith Governments and the private sector aimed at \r\nsecuring innovative and more affordable access to \r\ninsurance so that those affected by disasters can recover \r\nmore quickly. It is a question of fairness and economic \r\ndevelopment, because without insurance, many nations \r\nand communities find restoration and rebuilding simply \r\ntoo great a burden. We are also encouraged by the rapid \r\ndevelopment of clean, affordable alternative-energy \r\nsolutions for countries across the world, which offers \r\ngreat promise that we can achieve the 1.5°C target \r\nand prosper.\r\nI have no doubt that the role that I have embraced as \r\nCOP-23 President is the most important ever undertaken \r\nby a Fijian leader. I appeal to my fellow Pacific leaders \r\nto support me as we tackle the greatest challenge \r\nthat our region and the world have ever seen. I want \r\nto acknowledge the work of the past 30 years of the \r\nAlliance of Small Island States, which has consistently \r\nlooked after the interests of our peoples and reminded \r\nthe world that our interests are the interests of every \r\nglobal citizen. We are all in the same canoe, which is \r\nwhy we will have a Fijian ocean-going canoe — a na \r\ndrua — in the main hall in Bonn to remind everyone of \r\nthe need to fill its sails with the collective determination \r\nto move this process forward and deliver on the promise \r\nwe made to each other in Paris. To all the nations that \r\nhave yet to ratify the Paris Agreement, I say, please \r\ndo so.\r\nI appeal to the nations of the world and to all the \r\nleaders of the grand coalition for their support. I draw \r\nmy power as COP President from them and I will do \r\neverything in my power to use it wisely.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Fiji for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Josaia Voreqe Bainimarama, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Fiji, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Nasser Bourita, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Cooperation of the Kingdom \r\nof Morocco.\r\nMr. Bourita (Morocco) (spoke in Arabic): On \r\nbehalf of the delegation of the Kingdom of Morocco, \r\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on \r\nhis election to preside over the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session and to wish him every success \r\nin his noble task. We would also like to commend his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his excellent work \r\nand the successes that his presidency brought.\r\nWe would like to reiterate our support for the efforts \r\nof Secretary-General Guterres to reform the United \r\nNations and its mechanisms on the political, economic \r\nand security fronts. The proposed reforms create new \r\ndynamics, giving new momentum to the Organization’s \r\nactivities and strengthening the principles enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. We would also like to \r\nexpress the support of the Kingdom of Morocco for the \r\nroad map that the Secretary-General has proposed for \r\nmediation and preventive diplomacy in the settlement \r\nof disputes by peaceful means, building on efforts to \r\nmaintain peace, realize sustainable development and \r\ncombat terrorism. Our world today is at a crossroads \r\nthat is having a direct effect on our collective efforts to \r\nachieve sustainable development, strengthen peace and \r\nsecurity and lay the foundations of cooperation, and I \r\nwould therefore like to address three relevant issues.\r\nFirst, there can be no doubt that while walls \r\nbetween nations have come down and the numbers \r\nof victims have diminished, there have emerged new \r\nthreats to security, such as terrorism, extremism, \r\nseparatist movements and climate change, that are no \r\nless dangerous than previous ones. It is clear that while \r\nglobalization has greatly boosted the international \r\neconomy, it also triggered the economic and financial \r\ncrisis that led to increased unemployment and poverty \r\nand deepened social differences within States.\r\nSecondly, while information technology has \r\nwitnessed great developments, including expanded \r\nnetworks and growing numbers of users, some terrorist \r\norganizations have sought to use those developments \r\nto undermine security and stability, threaten the peace \r\nof individuals and erode development efforts, while \r\nstill others have used them to advance their criminal \r\nenterprises. This situation, which gives a glimpse of the \r\nfuture of our world, is very threatening because we are \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n26/29 17-29407\r\nunable to foresee what is coming. We therefore have to \r\nreform our collective working mechanisms in order to \r\nimprove their predictive capacities.\r\nThirdly, there are those who believe that they have \r\nthe ability and resources to fend for themselves against \r\nthese difficulties. However, the Kingdom of Morocco \r\nbelieves that only an effective, multilateral global \r\norganization can resolve the collective problems that \r\nwe are all facing.\r\nWe can no longer look at Africa as a burden on the \r\ninternational community. We Africans do not believe \r\nthat our continent has ever been a burden on the world, \r\ndespite the misunderstandings and unfair rulings and \r\njudgements that exist. Africa has yet to take its proper \r\nplace on the world’s agenda, which cannot be based \r\non the numbers of conferences dedicated to it, related \r\nagenda items taken up or resolutions adopted. The \r\ncontinent’s problems cannot be addressed through the \r\nmere provision of assistance. Given its varied natural \r\nand human resources — including approximately a \r\nbillion young people — its fertile lands and abundant \r\nwater, Africa has enormous potential.\r\nThanks to the foresight of His Majesty King \r\nMohammed VI, over the past two decades Morocco \r\nhas made South-South cooperation the basis of its \r\nforeign policy, reflecting the King’s view that such \r\ncooperation represents a promising foundation for the \r\nefforts of the international community. Morocco has \r\nadopted a realistic approach to forging partnerships \r\nand is supplying human resources and technological \r\nknow-how to assist African countries in their efforts. \r\nIn an address to the people of Morocco on 20 August \r\n2016, His Majesty emphasized that Morocco does not \r\nview Africa as a market for the sale and promotion of \r\nMoroccan products or as a source of quick profits, but \r\nas a forum for joint action to save the region and develop \r\nAfrican cities. That is why we have sought to establish \r\npartnerships with a number of African countries aimed \r\nat supporting economic growth and integration and \r\nproviding jobs and security. That was not a decision \r\nfuelled by opportunism but a historic commitment \r\nemerging from the King’s deep understanding of the \r\ncontinent, as he expressed at the twenty-eighth session \r\nof the Summit of the African Union when he said, \r\n“Africa is my continent. Africa is my home”.\r\nWith the same commitment and determination, \r\nMorocco will continue to shoulder its responsibility \r\nwithin the African Union as a founding member of its \r\nprecursor, the Organization of African Unity, and as \r\na committed partner that has never disappointed the \r\nAfrican continent but rather has always defended it \r\nin regional and international forums. We are always \r\neager to serve Africa and realize its ambitions and \r\nobjectives. Morocco is committed to multilateralism \r\nand to finding the right answers to problems, based on \r\nthe international community’s three important areas \r\nof responsibility — migration, climate change and the \r\nfight against terrorism and extremism — and attested \r\nto by the confidence that the international community \r\nhas placed in Morocco, which bases its approach on \r\naligning its national priorities with those on the United \r\nNations agenda and on sharing its experience with \r\nAfrican partners.\r\nAs Chair of the Global Counter-Terrorism Forum, \r\nMorocco, along with the Netherlands, works to \r\nstrengthen national and regional cooperation and to \r\nshare its experience in combating terrorism with its \r\nAfrican brothers and partners by sharing information \r\nand expertise, as well as through religious training \r\nprogrammes that reject all forms of intolerance and \r\nextremism and that have reached hundreds of thousands \r\nof imams and leaders, men and women, of various \r\nAfrican nationalities, at centres such as the Institute of \r\nMohammed V and the Mohammed VI Foundation for \r\nAfrican Ulema.\r\nMorocco co-chairs the Global Forum on Migration \r\nand Development, which seeks to develop proposals \r\nthat are not limited to security issues but are also \r\ninformed by the development and human aspects of \r\nmigration. We hope those efforts will be included in \r\nthe global compact on migration to be adopted by the \r\nUnited Nations in 2018. Within the African Union, \r\nKing Mohammed will be presenting a concept paper on \r\ndeveloping a joint African approach to migration and \r\nits root causes. Morocco has also developed a strategy \r\nfor activating a process that can help African citizens \r\nsouth of the Sahara fully enjoy their economic and \r\nsocial rights.\r\nWith regard to climate change, Morocco presided \r\nover the twenty-second session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change, held in Marrakech in November \r\n2016. Qualitative changes were made during the session \r\nin translating the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\ninto practical measures, as well as the adoption of \r\nthe Marrakech Declaration, which states that efforts \r\nto achieve development and sustainable development \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 27/29\r\nrepresent a high-level political commitment that should \r\nbe honoured with a balanced and cooperative approach \r\nthat meets the needs of least developed countries and \r\ndeveloping nations.\r\nAfrica is at the heart of Morocco’s interests in this \r\nregard. His Majesty chaired the first African summit \r\non climate change, which resulted in an ambitious \r\nand balanced action plan that reflects the continent’s \r\ncommitment to shouldering its responsibilities \r\nwith regard to international efforts. At the national \r\nlevel, Morocco has adopted an ambitious policy for \r\naddressing the effects of climate change, particularly \r\nwhere renewable energy is concerned. It should reduce \r\nour energy needs by 42 per cent by 2020 and 52 per cent \r\nby 2030, as well as lowering our carbon dependency. It \r\nshould also attract promising international investment \r\nin the development of clean energy.\r\nSince the 1960s, the Kingdom of Morocco has been \r\ncommitted to the United Nations cause in deploying \r\npeacekeeping forces in Africa. We have contributed \r\nto those international forces by sending military units \r\ntotalling 6,000 soldiers to six countries — Angola, \r\nthe Congo, Somalia, Côte d’Ivoire, the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo and the Central African \r\nRepublic, where there are currently more than 1,600 \r\nMoroccan military personnel. I would like to express \r\nMorocco’s deep concern about the irresponsible \r\nattacks that have recently been made on international \r\npeacekeepers. Such attacks trample on United Nations \r\nvalues and should be considered war crimes whose \r\nperpetrators should be brought to justice. The Kingdom \r\nof Morocco shares the Organization’s concern about \r\nsuch attacks and therefore requests that the Secretariat \r\ntake appropriate measures to protect peacekeepers \r\nin conflict zones. Today, we need a new approach to \r\npeacekeeping operations, making troop-contributing \r\ncountries central to their decision-making in a way that \r\nis based on the values of the United Nations.\r\nThe Palestinian question was one of the first just \r\ncauses taken up by the United Nations following its \r\ninception, yet no solution has been found to date, nor is \r\nany agreement in sight, despite the tremendous efforts \r\nmade by the international community, especially the \r\ncurrent United States Administration. The Kingdom \r\nof Morocco, whose King Mohammed VI chairs the \r\nAl-Quds Al-Sharif Committee of the Organization \r\nof Islamic Cooperation, reiterates its rejection of any \r\nattempts aimed at changing the historical and legal \r\nstatus of the Holy City and the Al-Aqsa Mosque and \r\nrenews its calls to the Israeli authorities to cease \r\nsuch practices.\r\nThe Arab Maghreb is still dealing with the difficult \r\nissues that have resulted from the lack of political \r\ncooperation and the vulnerable security situation \r\nproduced by the crisis in Libya. This raises questions \r\nfor the parties that are still dealing with past conflicts, \r\nsuch as in the Moroccan Sahara. If the international \r\ncommunity wishes to achieve a peaceful settlement \r\nbased on consensus, and if the Moroccan initiative for \r\nself-rule there is to gain more support, the parties in \r\nthe region involved in that dispute should abandon their \r\ntwo-faced discourse and assume their responsibilities. \r\nMorocco would like to emphasize its readiness to \r\nwork in honestly and transparently with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and Mr. Horst Köhler, his Personal Envoy for \r\nWestern Sahara, in order to reach a peaceful settlement \r\nthat can maintain Morocco’s territorial integrity and \r\nsovereignty, based on the self-rule initiative.\r\nMorocco is also developing a policy to enable the \r\npeople of the Moroccan Sahara to rule themselves and \r\nthus to enable North-West Africa to mitigate the dangers \r\nof separatism, Balkanization, extremism and terrorism. \r\nIn that context, we would like to call the Assembly’s \r\nattention to the terrible situation in the Tindouf refugee \r\ncamps and urge the international community to put \r\npressure on the host country to allow the Office of \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\nto respond to the Secretary-General’s call and register \r\neveryone in the camps.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Miguel Vargas Maldonado, \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs of the Dominican Republic.\r\nMr. Vargas Maldonado (Dominican Republic) \r\n(spoke in Spanish): I am honoured to address the General \r\nAssembly on behalf of the people and the Government \r\nof the Dominican Republic. At the outset, I would like \r\nto apologize on behalf of Mr. Danilo Madina Sánchez, \r\nPresident of the Dominican Republic, for his absence \r\nfrom the debate, as he has had to return to our country \r\nto deal with Hurricane Maria.\r\nOur meeting this week coincides with the \r\ndevastating season of natural disasters that our region \r\nhas been enduring for nearly a month with terrible \r\nconsequences. The disasters have also spread to Mexico, \r\nwhich has been hit by two destructive earthquakes, \r\nand the southern United States, viciously punished by \r\nHurricane Harvey. In the catalogue of human suffering \r\nA/72/PV.10 20/09/2017\r\n28/29 17-29407\r\ncaused by Hurricane Irma, that of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda stands out, particularly Barbuda, 90 per cent \r\nof whose infrastructure has collapsed, according to its \r\nPrime Minister, Gaston Browne. Hardly had Irma’s \r\ndevastating winds dropped than Maria arrived, leaving \r\na new trail of destruction and death, inflicting a direct \r\nhit first on Dominica and today on its neighbour Puerto \r\nRico, causing great destruction and damage.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express our solidarity \r\nwith Puerto Rico, which is also our neighbour, as \r\nwell as with all the countries affected. The people of \r\nthe Dominican Republic offer their deepest sympathy \r\nfor the destruction and the large numbers of victims. \r\nAccurate figures for the damage done on Saint \r\nBarthélemy, Saint Maarten, Anguilla, the Virgin \r\nIslands, Tortola, Turks and Caicos, Puerto Rico, the \r\nDominican Republic and especially Florida and Cuba, \r\nhave yet to be determined. However, we can say that \r\nthey have suffered substantial damage, that recovery \r\nwill take years and that, tragically, valuable lives have \r\nbeen lost.\r\nTo give Member States an idea of how severely \r\nwe have been affected, despite the lack of definitive \r\nfigures, I can say that the material losses caused by this \r\nhurricane season alone far exceed the gross domestic \r\nproduct of the Dominican Republic. We often focus \r\non material damage and ignore the human suffering \r\ncaused by such disasters, whose lethal power has \r\nbeen aggravated by climate change. The statistics are \r\nstriking, but they cannot reflect the pain of the victims, \r\ntheir desolation at seeing so much work ruined and \r\nso many efforts, visions and dreams lost. It is not just \r\nhouses that have been lost, it is homes. Material damage \r\nhas been done, but above all, lives have been shattered.\r\nWe must recognize the inherent dangers of climate \r\nchange, which are far more significant in the context \r\nof the geography of the Caribbean. Our economies, \r\nour way of life and our potential for development are \r\nin jeopardy. The vulnerability of the Caribbean and of \r\nthe Dominican Republic poses a risk that we cannot \r\nface alone. While our country was fortunate enough \r\nnot to suffer human losses during the recent passage \r\nof Hurricane Irma, we are aware that, like every \r\nCaribbean island, we will always be vulnerable to this \r\ntype of phenomenon.\r\nThat reality impels us to once again draw the \r\nAssembly’s attention to the crucial importance of \r\njoining forces to confront such threats. It compels us \r\nto act in a responsible and united way to defend the \r\nlives of our people. And I would like to be extremely \r\nclear on this point. The messages of solidarity and the \r\nhumanitarian aid that always follow such disasters are \r\nnot enough. Nor is it enough to sign agreements on \r\nclimate change. There is an urgent and critical need to \r\nact coherently on those agreements in order to advance \r\na united agenda and set concrete plans in motion.\r\nWe are facing a growing problem that knows no \r\nborders and requires the cooperation and solidarity of \r\nall of us, but especially the most developed and most \r\npowerful countries. We are facing a reality that will \r\noblige us to act as responsibly as we can if we do not \r\nwant to go on lamenting the consequences. That is why \r\nmy country is once again proposing to the Assembly \r\nthat we create a special fund for dealing with this type \r\nof disaster and for prevention and early warning, which \r\nwill help us save lives. If we want to see an example \r\nof how economic resources can help to mitigate the \r\ndamage done by natural phenomena, we need only look \r\nat the United States. After the most recent hurricanes, \r\nits Government, which has the necessary resources, \r\nimmediately made $15 billion available for rebuilding \r\nits affected states, thereby providing its citizens with \r\nthe help they needed. Conversely, there is no way \r\nthat vulnerable areas such as the island region of the \r\nCaribbean can cope with the devastation that such \r\nphenomena inflict on our peoples and countries.\r\nAs an example, take my own country, the \r\nDominican Republic. This year, natural phenomena in \r\nthe form of rains and f loods have damaged thousands \r\nof kilometres of highways and roads, resulting in \r\nsubstantial losses. Dozens of bridges have collapsed \r\nand miles of retaining walls and irrigation canals have \r\nbeen destroyed. Thousands of acres of mixed farmland \r\nthat are vital to keeping our people fed every day have \r\nbeen lost. In addition, among much other damage, \r\nhundreds of homes have been destroyed, not counting \r\nthose hit by Hurricane Irma. We have spent more than \r\n$500 million on rescue and relief operations just in the \r\npast few months.\r\nWe are therefore concerned about the fact that \r\nsimilar, or even more powerful, events resulting from \r\nclimate change have the potential to set the development \r\nof ours and other Caribbean countries back 10 years. \r\nI am talking about snatching away a whole people’s \r\nhappiness and prospects for the future. That is not \r\nsomething we can continue to take lightly. It is in that \r\n20/09/2017 A/72/PV.10\r\n17-29407 29/29\r\ncontext that the work of the United Nations and the \r\nsolidarity between our countries make most sense.\r\nOn behalf of all the men, women, children and \r\nelderly people who are utterly desperate right now, I \r\nurge all of us to seek ways for the United Nations to \r\nsupport Governments that cannot cope on their own \r\nin rebuilding their countries in the wake of natural \r\ndisasters. Let us take the necessary steps to make that \r\naid available and ensure that it reaches those in desperate \r\nneed. It is part of our responsibility as brother nations. \r\nI would also like to call on the countries of the United \r\nNations to reflect anew, and urgently, on what we must \r\ndo in order to counteract extreme climate events. The \r\nscientific evidence for the relationship between natural \r\ndisasters, man-made change and global warming is \r\nquite sufficient. It is time for us to play our part and act \r\nto slow down events, or the future will judge us for our \r\ntotal lack of responsibility.\r\nSince the Organization was founded, 72 years \r\nago, our country has been a member of the unique \r\nexperience in the history of humankind that is its \r\ncreation. Since then, the United Nations has been a \r\nbeacon pointing the way to a future of hope. We must \r\nnever fall into complacency on that road. We know \r\nthat essential aspects of our civilization, such as peace, \r\nsecurity and development, are not gifts that drop from \r\nthe sky. They are not something that we can take for \r\ngranted. They are the result of a commitment between \r\nour peoples that must be constantly renewed and that \r\nwe must keep working for. The Dominican Republic \r\nis fully committed to that vision and to the search \r\nfor comprehensive solutions to the challenges facing \r\nthe international community. We are determined to \r\ncontribute energetically to building an ever-more \r\ndemocratic, participatory and effective United Nations \r\nto help solve our peoples’ real problems.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.35 p.m.\r\n"
