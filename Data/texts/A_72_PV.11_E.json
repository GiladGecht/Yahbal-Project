"United Nations A/72/PV.11\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n11th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 21 September 2017, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Aleksandar Vučić, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Serbia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Serbia.\r\nMr. Aleksandar Vučić, President of the Republic \r\nof Serbia, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Aleksandar Vučić, President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nPresident Vučić: I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on assuming your important \r\nduties. I would also like to congratulate Mr. Peter \r\nThomson on his successful presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session and to avail myself \r\nof this opportunity to thank and pay tribute to the new \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, for his active \r\nengagement during the first year of his tenure in such a \r\nremarkably responsible post and for initiating a reform \r\nprocess of great importance to the Organization.\r\nIt is my great honour to address the Assembly for \r\nthe first time in this Hall in my capacity as President of \r\nthe Republic of Serbia. We have carefully followed the \r\naddresses made by world leaders over the past two days, \r\nand it seems that it would be no exaggeration to say \r\nthat almost everybody has spoken about the necessity \r\nof the reform of the United Nations and about peace and \r\nstability, often accusing someone else — an opposing \r\nparty — of acting to prevent peace and stability or \r\nbeing responsible for a difficult situation in the world. I \r\nwill do my best to avoid such an approach.\r\nLast year, in this very Hall, it was said that the \r\nsituation worldwide was difficult. Today it is certainly \r\nmore difficult than it was a year ago. Today, I take this \r\nopportunity to speak before the Assembly, not to attack \r\nthose who cannot defend themselves or those who \r\nwould not be able to defend themselves from the truth. \r\nI will speak about Serbia, its people, its re-entering \r\nof the world, and the fact that the world is once again \r\naccepting and embracing Serbia and Serbia is trying \r\nto understand the world, even if sometimes it might \r\nnot agree with the great Powers. Unlike some leaders, \r\nI have no need to patronize my people or to run an \r\nelection or non-election campaign from this rostrum, \r\nbecause we have already won all our internal political \r\nbattles. That is why I will speak about Serbia today and \r\nSerbia in the future, as well as the future of the entire \r\nWestern Balkans region, where I come from.\r\nIt important to speak about the entire Balkans, \r\nespecially its Western part, because without broader and \r\nmore serious insight into the problem we are facing, we \r\nwill not be able to see, let alone resolve, our individual \r\nproblems. I would like to share a quote from our famous \r\nwriter, Isidora Sekulić, who said the following:\r\n“A peninsula is a separate world. Countries \r\nand nations within it, as if embarked on one boat, \r\nmust have one common political problem and a \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The Balkans comes first, before all the \r\ncountries in the Balkans, whenever the moment is \r\ndifficult and dangerous, regardless of whether it is \r\ndangerous politically or in terms of culture. Will \r\nthe Balkans for once open its sleepy eyes and see \r\nits paramount cultural capacity, if it plunges as \r\na whole?”\r\nCondition number one for a prosperous future for \r\nall of us in that region is how to preserve peace and \r\ntranquillity. The Republic of Serbia invests a great \r\ndeal of effort in stabilizing the situation in the region, \r\nwhich is our permanent commitment and policy. As we \r\nhave done so far, we will continue to work devotedly \r\nand committedly to promote regional stability and \r\ncooperation, because we believe that it is an investment \r\nin a better tomorrow for all of us. In order to achieve \r\nsuccess today and progress in the future, it is necessary, \r\nno matter how pathetic that might seem, to preserve \r\npeace and stability at all costs. This is a priority \r\nsociopolitical task that requires daily hard work and \r\nlearning. That in turn will help economic growth and \r\nreforms, which are a prerequisite for a better life, not \r\nonly for the poor but also for the middle classes.\r\nIn previous years, we in Serbia demonstrated that \r\nwith responsible politics of fiscal consolidation, even \r\nwithout huge privatization incomes, we could create \r\na budget surplus. We lowered the unemployment rate \r\nfrom 26 per cent to 12 per cent and created a f lexible \r\nlabour market by introducing modern laws, even though \r\ndoing that has proved difficult for some far stronger \r\ncountries in the developed West. Above all else, I am \r\nproud that we have begun to invest in the creativity of \r\nour young people and that digitalization and artificial \r\nintelligence are becoming important topics in Serbia, \r\nnot just in the most developed countries of the world.\r\nOf course, there are still many things that we \r\nmust deliver. When a person comes from the Western \r\nBalkans the first question is whether we will be part of \r\nsome new conflict or whether we will opt for a better \r\nand more carefree future. In spite of its numerous \r\nchallenges, Serbia will continue investing in efforts to \r\ncreate conditions for better relations within the region \r\nthat are based on mutual respect and commitment to a \r\ncommon European future.\r\nToday I would particularly like to mention the \r\npolitical issues in the region and Belgrade’s relations \r\nwith Pristina. Bearing in mind the paramount \r\nimportance of this issue for the Republic of Serbia, I \r\nunderline once again that reaching a political solution to \r\nthe issue of Kosovo and Metohija is a national priority \r\nfor Serbia. It is an issue that has a huge effect not only \r\non our economy but also on a clear future for young \r\npeople both in Serbia and in the entire region.\r\nWe all know that we do not recognize the unilateral \r\ndeclaration of independence of so-called Kosovo, but \r\nI will not speak about disrespect for our territorial \r\nintegrity and sovereignty. Instead, I will speak about \r\nour efforts to resolve the problem and to try to find \r\na solution to a centuries-long problem that the great \r\nPowers were not helpful with back in 1999 and 2008. \r\nI will speak about our efforts to talk about the future \r\nwith Albanian leaders from Pristina.\r\nYesterday we all listened to Michael Bloomberg \r\nsaying that it is better to spend thousands of hours talking \r\nthan one minute fighting. Everything that has been \r\nachieved so far through the Brussels dialogue has been \r\nthe result of difficult compromises and unambiguous \r\nconcessions on both sides, albeit mostly on ours. The \r\nsignificant progress reached throughout this process \r\nconfirms the constructiveness and commitment of the \r\nRepublic of Serbia to this dialogue.\r\nWe have also demonstrated our readiness to make \r\ncompromises that were not easy, thereby helping to \r\nfind mutually acceptable solutions to many complex \r\nissues. I want to emphasize that in the past four years, \r\nafter we started the dialogue process in Brussels, \r\nalthough there have been some fights, quarrels and \r\nphysical attacks against the Serbs in the territory of \r\nKosovo and Metohija, nobody has been killed in ethnic \r\nconfrontations. For Serbs and for Albanians, this is a \r\ngreat step forward, and I am therefore eager to continue \r\nwith such political efforts in the future.\r\nNevertheless, upon entering this Hall, we received \r\ninformation that Pristina’s authorities had announced \r\nthat they had secured the majority needed for Kosovo \r\nto gain membership status in UNESCO. I urge the \r\nAssembly not to allow this, and remind members that it \r\nwas these very people who took part in the devastation \r\nof Serbian monasteries, churches and cultural and \r\nspiritual heritage sites in Kosovo and Metohija.\r\nAdditionally, we have made great efforts to \r\nstabilize the overall situation in the Balkans. We have \r\noften stayed silent in the face of insults and attacks \r\nfrom various other countries because we know that \r\npeace and reconciliation are more important than \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 3/26\r\nscoring easy political points. Precisely because of that, \r\nSerbs are more than eager to continue with successful \r\neconomic reforms, as well as with the idea for creating \r\na regional economic zone, which we do not intend to \r\ngive up on.\r\nThe former Yugoslavia was widely respected as a \r\nmarket and for its success in attracting investors and \r\ninternational attention. Today, we are too small to \r\nsucceed as individual markets. I therefore firmly believe \r\nthat a unique customs zone and taxation system are the \r\nfuture of the region. An example of the problems we \r\nhave is that a farmer producing milk only 10 kilometres \r\nfrom the border loses at least 7 to 8 per cent of his profit \r\nby waiting 48 hours to cross into another country. I also \r\nbelieve that a better, improved economy is the second \r\nbiggest task for all our nations and for Serbia as well.\r\nThe third issue — no less important than the first \r\nand second — is uniting the big tasks of economic \r\nprogress with our aspirations to European Union (EU) \r\nmembership. The path to membership in the EU, our \r\nmost important trade and investment partner, is seen \r\nas leading to greater stability, economic progress and \r\nthe consolidation of democracy. In previous years, the \r\nEU enlargement policy for Western Balkan countries \r\nhas been one of the most powerful instruments in the \r\npolitical and economic transformation of the countries \r\nof the region into stable and modern societies.\r\nWe believe that this policy, regardless of all the \r\ndifficulties existing within the EU itself as well as in \r\nthe candidate countries and potential candidates, must \r\ncontinue, and on an equally strong basis. We all want \r\nto be a part of the EU, but sometimes people in the \r\nBalkans and people in Serbia are treated unfairly, in \r\ncontrast to those who took that route earlier. We are \r\nasking the EU not to speed up our accession process but \r\nto treat us fairly and, at least to some extent, in the same \r\nmanner that it treated some of the full-f ledged Member \r\nStates admitted after 2003.\r\nAs all are aware, Serbs are a very dignified people, \r\nand we expect all other countries of the world to respect \r\nus as we respect them and their territorial integrity \r\nand sovereignty. We have never wanted nor will we \r\never want something that belongs to somebody else. \r\nWe ask only for equal respect for our country and its \r\npeople. I am proud that Serbia protects its freedom, \r\nindependence and sovereignty and is a country that \r\nobserves democratic principles. We will continue along \r\nthat path and never give up the politics of military \r\nneutrality, because we believe that it is the politics of \r\npeace and the future.\r\nWhile we strive towards joining the EU and \r\nestablishing partnerships with Western countries, \r\nincluding by improving our relations with the United \r\nStates, we continue to cherish the best possible relations \r\nwith the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic \r\nof China. Not only are we not ashamed of those good \r\nrelations, we are very proud of them. But we will always \r\nbe ready to observe developments in today’s world by \r\nnot judging superficially what is right or wrong, just \r\nor unjust. We have never threatened anybody, nor will \r\nwe, but we will always dare to condemn actions such \r\nas launching a missile that forces the inhabitants of the \r\nJapanese island of Hokkaido to spend a day or a night \r\nin shelters.\r\nI would like to remind members that the courageous \r\nand wise American President Dwight D. Eisenhower \r\nwas prudent enough to say that\r\n“every gun that is made, every warship launched, \r\nevery rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a \r\ntheft from those who hunger and are not fed, those \r\nwho are cold and are not clothed”.\r\nLikewise, we will always show care for and solidarity \r\nwith Syrian, Afghan, sub-Saharan or any other \r\nrefugees, without diminishing our resolve to confront \r\ninternational terrorism and radical Islamic movements \r\nsuch as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham or \r\nAl-Qaida, because we believe that a democratic society \r\nbased on equal rights for all is the only society that we \r\nwant to live and see our future in.\r\nWe recognize that fighting poverty and social \r\ninequality in the context of preventing radicalism and \r\nstrengthening extremism is a very important task. We \r\nchampion the integration of citizens of all religions \r\nand political and other affiliations into modern society \r\non a basis of common values, while preserving each \r\nperson’s individual identity and respect for all.\r\nSerbia believes in and is pleased with the \r\nincreasingly important role of the United Nations, \r\nnot only in maintaining peace and stability, but in the \r\nmore important tasks the Organization performs for the \r\nbenefit of humankind today. Serbia will support any \r\nUnited Nations reform that strengthens the role of the \r\nOrganization, because it means more discussion, less \r\nuse of force and less arrogance in international relations. \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n4/26 17-29579\r\nOur job is therefore to do everything we can to enable \r\na more active role for the United Nations worldwide.\r\nI will conclude with words that are often attributed \r\nto the great Albert Einstein:\r\n“The world is a dangerous place to live. Not \r\nbecause of the people who are evil, but because of \r\nthe people who do not do anything about it.”\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Serbia \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Aleksandar Vučić, President of the Republic \r\nof Serbia, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Jovenel Moïse, President of the \r\nRepublic of Haiti\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Haiti.\r\nMr. Jovenel Moïse, President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti, was escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Jovenel Moïse, President of the Republic \r\nof Haiti, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Moïse (spoke in French): At the outset, \r\nI would like to convey our sincere congratulations to \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to preside over this \r\nsession of the General Assembly.\r\nToday, all eyes rightly turn to the United Nations, \r\nwhose mission has never been so essential. That is why \r\nwe must pursue the reform process started years ago, in \r\norder to better adapt our Organization to modern reality \r\nso that it can effectivelyattain the goals enshrined in \r\nthe founding Charter of the United Nations. In that \r\nconnection, I welcome the vision and leadership of \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres. I hope that under \r\nhis able leadership, the Organization can honour the \r\ncommitments and initiatives aimed at improving living \r\nconditions for everyone on our planet and enabling the \r\nUnited Nations to confront global threats and prevent \r\nand resolve conflicts.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti fully supports any initiative \r\nthat reduces international tensions, defuses crises and \r\nachieves peaceful settlements to disputes. We believe \r\nthat the United Nations must act in the context of \r\nconflict prevention. The Republic of Haiti has always \r\nspoken out against the proliferation of nuclear weapons \r\nand firmly condemns any tension generated by the \r\ndesire to possess and produce nuclear weapons.\r\nIn the Middle East, the Syrian crisis continues \r\nto shock our universal conscience. In this very Hall, \r\nnumerous resolutions have been voted on calling \r\nfor an end to that inhumane tragedy, which has left \r\ncountless dead. The prevailing status quo in the \r\nIsraeli-Palestinian conflict, punctuated by intermittent \r\nviolence, will obviously not produce a solution.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti calls for an honourable exit \r\nfrom the present situation that can benefit our brother \r\npeople of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela, and \r\nurges all the parties involved to engage in dialogue \r\nand negotiation.\r\nThe successful negotiated outcome of the conflict \r\nin Colombia shows that it is not armed confrontation \r\nand blind violence that resolve disputes. May the \r\nvictory in Colombia serve as an example to us all.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti, true to its ideals of peace, \r\ndialogue and friendliness among peoples, would very \r\nmuch like to see a window of opportunity offered \r\nto the Republic of China on Taiwan, so that it can \r\nparticipate in the major decisions that we, the Member \r\nStates, have adopted to improve the human condition \r\non planet Earth.\r\nAs I address the Assembly for the first time, I \r\nrecognize our immense responsibility for addressing \r\nthe environmental challenges and threats confronting \r\nthe planet. The Republic of Haiti is committed to the \r\nenvironmental dimension of sustainable development. \r\nAs an island State, Haiti is determined to strengthen its \r\nresilience in the face of the natural disasters that affect \r\nthe Caribbean region every year. The Haitian people are \r\nmaking tremendous efforts to recover from the damage \r\ncaused by Hurricanes Matthew and Irma.\r\nSimilarly, the unprecedented scale of destruction \r\nby consecutive hurricanes inflicted on our sister \r\nCaribbean countries, including Antigua and Barbuda \r\nand Dominica, as well as parts of Texas and Florida in \r\nthe United States of America, shows the adverse effects \r\nof global warming on our planet. In that regard, the \r\nRepublic of Haiti would like to express its solidarity \r\nwith the victims in general and the people of the \r\nCaribbean in particular. We also stand with the victims \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 5/26\r\nof natural disasters and the people and the Government \r\nof Mexico.\r\nIn that regard, my country attaches particular \r\nimportance to the fulfilment of commitments under the \r\nParis Climate Agreement, especially since the prospects \r\nfor sustainable development are shrinking in the wake \r\nof environmental crises and climate degradation. We \r\ntherefore hope that major greenhouse-gas-emitting \r\ncountries will contribute the necessary resources for \r\nthe effective implementation of the Paris Agreement. \r\nWe firmly believe that we must honour the pledge to \r\nequip the most vulnerable countries with the means \r\nto help them make the energy transition to renewable \r\nenergies and bolster their resilience to the adverse \r\neffects of climate change.\r\nIn the Caribbean, and in Haiti in particular, the \r\nlatest events have reminded us of the extent to which \r\nclimate change affects our countries. And at the same \r\nmoment, the spectacular power of Hurricane Maria \r\nthreatens us again. But the fact is that what happens to \r\nus is not fated, but is rather a result of human beings’ \r\nactions on their environment, which we have a shared \r\nresponsibility to repair. The victim countries, including \r\nthe Republic of Haiti, do not have the spare resources \r\nto respond adequately to the tragic consequences of \r\nclimate change.\r\nI call for an increase in insurance coverage for \r\nhurricanes and other natural disasters. The small \r\nCaribbean countries, with severely limited economic \r\nresources, need an insurance system that is proportionate \r\nto the threat. To that end, in January 2018, when Haiti \r\nassumes the presidency of the Caribbean Community, \r\nwe intend to organize a regional conference to set up \r\nan inter-State commission to agree on an appropriate \r\nstrategy. It will be a logical follow up to Haiti’s call \r\nat the fifth summit of the Global Platform for Disaster \r\nRisk Reduction, held in Cancún, Mexico, in May, for \r\nthe creation of a regional fund to finance programmes \r\nto mitigate the effects of natural disasters in the region. \r\nThe fund would be financed based on a percentage of \r\nthe gross domestic product of the affected countries \r\nand by developed countries that emit greenhouse gases. \r\nHaiti would like to take this opportunity to appeal to \r\nStates Members of the United Nations that are affected \r\nby climate change to take this approach as well.\r\nThis year unquestionably marks a break with \r\nthe instability that has been such an obstacle to the \r\ndevelopment of the Republic of Haiti. Since my accession \r\nto the presidency on 7 February, my Administration \r\nhas worked to consolidate democracy and the rule of \r\nlaw by making efforts to create conditions conducive \r\nto socioeconomic development and political and \r\nsocial stability.\r\nFirst, the Haitian Government has been \r\nuncompromising in tackling corruption — overbilling \r\nfor public contracts, misuse of State property and \r\ncheques made out to fictitious employees, all facilitated \r\nby corrupt individuals who, through such despicable \r\ncrimes, steal the fruits of education from the children \r\nof the Haitian people. Corruption, in all of its forms, \r\nplagues and atrophies the economy. It has deeply \r\nweakened our political foundation and destabilized the \r\ncountry’s social fabric.\r\nCorruption is a crime against development. The \r\nmillions of dollars spent Haiti in recent decades were \r\nsometimes channeled into contracts that destabilized \r\nthe national economy to our people’s detriment. It is \r\ntherefore high time that official development assistance \r\nand our domestic resources served the interests of the \r\nentire Haitian nation. Corruption deprives the Haitian \r\nGovernment of the resources it needs to provide basic \r\nservices to the population. If it is not stopped but rather \r\ncontinues to spread, it will fuel political and social \r\ninstability. It deprives the vast majority of Haitians of \r\nadequately distributed electricity, a quality education \r\nfor their children, clean drinking water and social and \r\neconomic opportunities. With the aim of reversing this \r\ndevastating trend, the new Haitian leadership is waging \r\na determined struggle against corruption.\r\nAs regards the public administration, the \r\nGovernment is working on five priorities based on the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. We are \r\nworking with Parliament to strengthen our republican \r\ninstitutions in order to provide citizens with better \r\naccess to public services. This policy has been given \r\ntangible form through the Caravan of Change, a strategy \r\naimed at providing electricity 24 hours a day through \r\nclean energy. We are looking to manage groundwater, \r\nirrigate agricultural land and tend to our rivers, which, if \r\nnot cared for, pose an environmental threat. We are also \r\nstriving to overcome our housing deficit and to provide \r\n12,000 more classrooms throughout the country.\r\nWith regard to the rule of law, measures currently \r\nunder way aim to guarantee the independence and \r\nincrease the effectiveness of our judicial apparatus. \r\nWe are strengthening our fight against corruption, \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n6/26 17-29579\r\ncontraband and impunity. We are reinforcing public \r\nsecurity by continuously improving and building the \r\ncapacities of the Haitian National Police. At the same \r\ntime, we are remobilizing Haiti’s armed forces, which \r\nare working in accordance with a new development \r\nframework and strictly in line with the Constitution.\r\nThe international community has been supporting \r\nnational and public security in Haiti for 13 years, and \r\nwith every national disaster, friendly countries have had \r\nto come to the aid of the Haiti people, showing why we \r\nneed a strong defence force and why Haiti, following the \r\ndeparture of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \r\nHaiti (MINUSTAH), will gradually establish a military \r\nforce to accomplish three key mandates.\r\nWe will first create an engineering unit able to \r\ncontribute to major public-works projects and intervene \r\npromptly following natural disasters. Secondly, we \r\nwill launch an aviation unit for training young people \r\nin aeronautical mechanics and pilots able to f ly \r\nhelicopters in the wake of natural disasters; and thirdly, \r\nwe will have a medical unit able to care for the victims \r\nof natural disasters and residents of the most remote \r\nareas of our country.\r\nOn the economic front, despite our lack of national \r\nresources, the Government is mobilizing all levers at its \r\ndisposal to get the economy back on a path to growth. \r\nThis year, through a legislative agenda based on the \r\njoint efforts of the political parties, we have enacted \r\neight of nine laws geared to improving the business \r\nclimate. Similarly, through its dynamic policies, \r\nmy Administration is taking necessary if politically \r\ncontroversial measures to get Haiti’s economy back on \r\na path to growth and to create decent jobs, particularly \r\nfor young people concerned about their futures. In that \r\nregard, our human resources management office is \r\nworking in a framework of State reform, through public \r\nexaminations, to recruit 12,000 young civil servants in \r\norder to give new impetus to the growth and development \r\nof public administration, and will be replacing civil \r\nservants who are on the brink of retirement.\r\nWe are determined to provide other alternatives \r\nand opportunities, particularly to the most vulnerable \r\nsectors of our society, to ensure that they are not \r\ntempted to leave the country, sometimes putting their \r\nlives in danger, in search of better living conditions. \r\nHaiti cannot continue to see its young people f lee in \r\nsearch of opportunities, driven by the corruption \r\nand the destruction of national institutions that have \r\nsignificantly widened the gap between citizens and \r\nthe State.\r\nWe wish to thank all friendly countries of the \r\nregion who have taken in Haitian migrants and will \r\ntherefore contribute actively to international efforts in \r\n2018 to adopt a global compact for safe, orderly and \r\nregular migration.\r\nThe Haitian Government has undertaken efforts to \r\ngive its agricultural sector new momentum through the \r\nCaravan of Change. All of the country’s departments will \r\nbenefit from the public authorities’ efforts to develop \r\ntheir potential for social and economic development. In \r\none area of Artibonite, and in the South, in Grand’Anse \r\nand Les Nippes, we have already launched a strategy \r\nwhereby the once moribund State will relaunch long-\r\nneglected but essential work. We intend to do our all to \r\nhalt the accelerated degradation of the environment and \r\nmake Haiti more resilient to climate change, improve \r\nbasic essential public infrastructure, increase the \r\nprovision of basic services, and stimulate the private \r\nsector and foreign direct investment.\r\nWhat is really at stake here, and what is crucial, is \r\ncreating an enabling environment for strong, sustained \r\nand inclusive growth that will create jobs. Our long-\r\nterm goal is to make Haiti a magnet for investment. The \r\nHaitian people are acutely aware that they are primarily \r\nresponsible for taking ownership of and organizing the \r\ncountry in a sovereign fashion. All our endeavours at \r\nthe economic level are focused on making rational use \r\nof our scant resources and doing everything we can \r\nwith them.\r\nWhile we are deeply grateful to the United Nations \r\nfor its commitment to Haiti, I would be remiss if I \r\ndid not recall two lamentable situations that have \r\narisen from its presence in our country. On the one \r\nhand, we have seen odious acts of sexual exploitation \r\nand violence committed by certain peacekeepers or \r\nother members of United Nations staff; and on the \r\nother, we have witnessed the introduction of a cholera \r\nepidemic into Haiti. The harmful consequences of \r\nthese demonstrations of international solidarity imply, \r\nas the United Nations has already recognized, a moral \r\nobligation to enact measures to provide the resources \r\nnecessary to eliminate cholera in Haiti.\r\nImproving the health-care system, including \r\nby eradicating cholera, is a priority of the Haitian \r\nGovernment. Despite the recent progress, the number of \r\nvictims stands at approximately 10,000 and, regrettably, \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 7/26\r\ncontinues to grow. There are tens of thousands of \r\ncholera orphans. The time has therefore come for the \r\nUnited Nations to truly live up to its noble ideals, based \r\nfundamentally on respect for human rights, by assuming \r\nits full responsibility for remedying a situation that has \r\ndone serious harm to the Haitian people. It is high time \r\nthat the United Nations honoured the commitments it \r\nhas made under the new approach to fighting the cholera \r\nepidemic recommended by the Secretary-General \r\nand approved by the General Assembly. We therefore \r\nalign ourselves with the urgent appeal launched by \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres to establish a \r\ntrust fund to fully implement the two components of \r\nthis new approach.\r\nWe also welcome the decision taken by the \r\nGeneral Assembly to reallocate $40.5 million from the \r\nMINUSTAH budget for 2015-2016 to the fight against \r\nthe epidemic. We would like to see  other international \r\npartners follow that example. We want to ensure that \r\nthe sick receive adequate care, that the victims and their \r\nchildren get due compensation, and that drinking water \r\nand sanitation systems in Haiti are developed under the \r\nauspices of the National Directorate for Drinking Water \r\nand Sanitation.\r\nThe Republic of Haiti is resolutely committed to \r\nmaking progress and strengthening the rule of law. Of \r\ncourse, these objectives remain works in progress. The \r\nnew leadership of Haiti will spare no effort to foster \r\nthe great transformations necessary to bring the State \r\nout of its traumatic and painful lethargy. The Haitian \r\nGovernment is working tirelessly to ensure the safety \r\nand well-being of its people. These are vital prerequisites \r\nfor achieving the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nPolitical stability is the most important of all \r\npublic goods, as I said in my election campaign. In that \r\nregard, I intend to continue the dialogue I began last \r\nweek on building robust institutions in the political \r\nsphere, a dialogue in which almost all the political \r\nparties in Parliament and all local authorities took part. \r\nMoreover, in the coming weeks, my Administration \r\nwill begin a national consultation in all sectors with a \r\nview to achieving the stability required to undertake a \r\nprogramme of economic and social development over \r\nthe next 25 years at least.\r\nEconomic, political and social stakeholders in \r\nHaiti are aware of the overriding obligation they have \r\nto promote social peace in order to fulfil the destiny \r\nthat has been reserved for our noble and great nation, a \r\ncradle of liberty, equality and fraternity, the Republic \r\nof Haiti.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of Haiti for \r\nthe statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Jovenel Moïse, President of the Republic of \r\nHaiti, was escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Moon Jae-in, President of the \r\nRepublic of Korea\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, \r\nwas escorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic \r\nof Korea, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Moon (spoke in Korean; interpretation \r\nprovided by the delegation): First of all, on behalf of the \r\npeople and the Government of the Republic of Korea, \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to convey my \r\ndeepest sympathy to the victims of the earthquake that \r\nhit Mexico on 19 September  as well as to the people \r\nand the Government of Mexico.\r\nI would like to express my respect and gratitude to \r\nall Member States and the staff of the Secretariat for \r\ntheir contributions to world peace and security.\r\nI congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. I expectt this session will yield many \r\nmeaningful results under his excellent leadership.\r\nI also wish Secretary-General António Guterres \r\ngreat success. The Republic of Korea is a strong \r\nsupporter of the goals of the United Nations aimed \r\nat preventing conflicts and sustaining peace. I look \r\nforward to its rebirth as an even stronger organization \r\nfor fostering peace and prosperity for all peoples during \r\nhis tenure as Secretary-General.\r\nAs I prepared this address, I thought about the \r\nspirit of the United Nations and the joint mission we \r\nall share. The United Nations is perhaps one of the best \r\ninstitutional inventions created by human intelligence. \r\nIt was born to save succeeding generations from \r\nthe scourge of war and has worked tirelessly to meet \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n8/26 17-29579\r\nthe challenges confronting humankind over the past \r\n70 years. The role and contribution to the international \r\ncommunity of the United Nations will continue to grow \r\nover time. Today the number of transnational issues \r\ncontinues to increase, and no country can resolve them \r\nsingle-handedly. For this reason, we should truly fulfil \r\nthe spirit of the United Nations in finding solutions to \r\nall the problems facing us.\r\nTo that end, I hope the world will look to the \r\nRepublic of Korea, located on the southern part of the \r\nKorean peninsula at the eastern end of the Eurasian \r\ncontinent. I believe the candlelight rallies last winter \r\nin my country represented a historic moment that \r\nreflectedthe brilliant achievement of the spirit of the \r\nUnited Nations. Embodying the power of cooperation \r\nand solidarity in defiance of challenges, the rallies lit \r\nthe way ahead towards a future for humankind. Some \r\nmay remember the scenes of the candlelight rallies \r\nshown by the media. On streets sparkling with millions \r\nof lights, people expressed their opinions freely and \r\njoined in discussions on every street corner. There \r\nwas singing, dancing and painting, the radiant faces \r\nof parents taking their children by the hand to join the \r\nrallies, and the pride of young people who picked up \r\ntrash on the streets afterwards. All those scenes were \r\nvery much a part of our democracy and peace.\r\nThe candlelight revolution in Korea started in a \r\npublic square where a yearning for the restoration of \r\ndemocracy and the Constitution awakened citizens’ \r\ncollective intelligence. I myself participated in the \r\nrallies as an ordinary citizen. The people of the Republic \r\nof Korea achieved democracy in the most peaceful and \r\nbeautiful manner. They proved the power of popular \r\nsovereignty, which is the quintessence of democracy. \r\nThey also proved that the power of peace can bring \r\ngreater changes to the world than violence can.\r\nThe new Administration of the Republic of Korea \r\nwas made possible by that candlelight revolution. \r\nBeyond its significance in making way for democratic \r\nelections, the Administration was established through \r\nthe people’s participation and aspirations in the \r\nawareness that they are the rightful owners of the nation. \r\nI stand here now on behalf of that Administration. I \r\nam very thankful for, as well as proud, of the fact that \r\nthe Republic of Korea, while it is a democracy that \r\nbloomed only recently, has shown the world new hope \r\nfor that form of Government. Currently building on its \r\nnew-found strength, the Republic of Korea intends to \r\nplay an active role in addressing the issues facing the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe Republic of Korea has always walked in step \r\nwith the United Nations. Since our Government was \r\nestablished, in 1948, we have received significant \r\nassistance from the United Nations, both during \r\nthe Korean War and in the process of post-war \r\nreconstruction. Although we were not able to become \r\na Member of the United Nations until 1991, we have \r\nenhanced our role and responsibilities as a State \r\nMember faster than any other in the span of only a \r\nsingle generation. Since 1993, Korea continues to \r\nparticipate in peacekeeping operations. As Chair of the \r\nPeacebuilding Commission this year, it is focusing on \r\nresolving the root causes of conflicts.\r\nIn the past five years, the Republic of Korea has \r\nincreased its financial assistance for refugees 15-\r\nfold, and last year, it joined the $20-million-plus club \r\nunder the aegis of the Office of the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees. By expediting the \r\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange and making changes in its own energy policy, \r\nthe Korean Government is also taking a lead role in \r\nsupporting the climate-change responses of developing \r\ncountries through the Global Green Growth Institute and \r\nthe Green Climate Fund. Moreover, my Administration \r\nhas reached the goal of filling 30 per cent of its Cabinet \r\npositions with female ministers, thereby spearheading \r\nefforts to realize gender equality, one of the Goals of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nIn the next few years, the Republic of Korea \r\nwill significantly increase its contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations in every sector. It is truly meaningful \r\nthat the theme of this session of the General \r\nAssembly — “Focusing on people: Striving for peace \r\nand a decent life for all on a sustainable planet” — is \r\nin line with the philosophy of governance of the new \r\nAdministration in the Republic of Korea. “People come \r\nfirst” is the slogan that I have used for several years to \r\nexpress my political philosophy, and the people are at \r\nthe centre of every policy of my new Administration. As \r\nof now, my Administration is pursuing bold measures \r\nto change the economic paradigm so as to deal with \r\ninequalities that stand in the way of growth and \r\nsocial cohesion. We are currently pursuing economic \r\npolicies focused on income growth for individuals \r\nand households, and promoting an economy in which \r\ngrowth is fuelled by job creation and everyone can \r\nenjoy equal opportunities and the products of growth. \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 9/26\r\nThat is what we call a people-centred economy. My \r\nAdministration’s determined endeavours to realize \r\ninclusive growth will not be confined to our country. \r\nIn accordance with that new paradigm, the Republic of \r\nKorea will offer its support for sustainable growth in \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nI was born in a refugee town in the middle of the \r\nKorean War. That civil war, which evolved into an \r\ninternational war, devastated countless lives. More \r\nthan 3 million people died, and many of the survivors \r\nwere deprived of a decent living. My father was one \r\nof them. My father, who believed that he was taking \r\ntemporary refuge at that time, was never able to return \r\nto his hometown before he passed away. I come from \r\none of the separated families — victims whose human \r\nrights were violated because of the war. The war has yet \r\nto come to a complete end.\r\nThe Korean War, which began as an offshoot of \r\nthe larger Cold War, continues to this day. Although \r\nthe Cold War ended and it has been 64 years since the \r\nconclusion of the Korean armistice agreement, the war \r\ncontinues in the form of an uneasy ceasefire on the \r\npeninsula — the last remnant of the Cold War order in \r\nNorth-East Asia. As tensions mount in North-East Asia \r\nbecause of the North Korean nuclear and missile issue, \r\nthe memory of war and its wounds are becoming more \r\nacute, and hearts that long for peace are filled with pain. \r\nThat describes the situation concerning the Republic of \r\nKorea on the Korean peninsula in September 2017.\r\nFor me, the President of the only divided country \r\nin the world, achieving peace is a calling and a historic \r\nduty. I represent my fellow citizens, who have sent a \r\nmessage of peace through their candlelight revolution \r\nto the global village in which wars and conflicts know \r\nno end. At the same time, I have been entrusted with \r\nthe responsibility of safeguarding my people’s right to \r\npeace and to undisturbed daily life as universal values. \r\nFor those reasons, I hope that North Korea will be \r\nable to choose its own path leading to peace. I believe \r\nthat peace, when it is chosen willingly, naturally \r\nbecomes sound and sustainable. More than anything, \r\nI am grateful that my convictions are shared by the \r\ninternational community.\r\nDespite the international community’s concerted \r\ndemands and warnings, and to our great disappointment \r\nand indignation, North Korea recently carried out \r\nits sixth nuclear test and additional missile-related \r\nprovocations. In the wake of the nuclear test, the Korean \r\nGovernment has consequently convinced countries \r\nin and beyond the region of the need for stronger \r\nsanctions and pressure to make North Korea end them \r\nand choose the path of dialogue. I very much appreciate \r\nthe Security Council’s unanimous and unprecedentedly \r\nrapid adoption of resolution 2375 (2017), on North \r\nKorea sanctions, with measures tougher than in any \r\nprevious resolution. That clearly reflects the fact that \r\nthe international community is collectively outraged \r\nand is responding with one voice to address the North \r\nKorean nuclear issue and the problems on the Korean \r\npeninsula. Once again, as the representative of one of \r\nthe parties directly involved with issues concerning \r\nthe Korean peninsula, I would like to express my \r\nappreciation to the international community for its \r\nshared understanding and support for the position of \r\nthe Korean Government.\r\nDespite North Korea’s f lagrant violation of its \r\nobligations and commitments under the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, the Korean Government and the \r\ninternational community are determined to make \r\nevery possible effort to resolve the North Korean \r\nnuclear issue peacefully. The relevant Security Council \r\nsanctions on North Korea, in resolutions that articulate \r\nthe principles of a peaceful, diplomatic and political \r\nsettlement of the North Korean nuclear issue, are also \r\npart of those efforts.\r\nOnce again, here in the General Assembly, where \r\nnations pledge to act to achieve world peace and the \r\nshared prosperity of all peoples, I will make the \r\nfollowing points very clear to North Korea and the \r\ninternational community. We do not desire the collapse \r\nof North Korea. We will not seek reunification by \r\nabsorption or artificial means. If North Korea makes \r\nthe decision, even at this juncture, to stand on the right \r\nside of history, we are ready, alongside the international \r\ncommunity, to assist. North Korea should acknowledge \r\nall these immutable facts as soon as possible. It must \r\nimmediately cease making reckless decisions that \r\ncould lead to its own isolation and downfall, and choose \r\nthe path of dialogue. I urge North Korea to abandon \r\nits hostile policies against other countries and to give \r\nup its nuclear weapons programme in a verifiable and \r\nirreversible way.\r\nThe efforts of the international community should \r\nalso be strengthened. It must continue to respond \r\nstrongly and sternly until North Korea gives up its \r\nnuclear programme of its own accord. All nations must \r\nthoroughly implement Security Council sanctions \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n10/26 17-29579\r\nresolutions and seek new measures in the event of \r\nany further provocations by the North. It is also \r\nimportant to manage the situation calmly. All of our \r\nendeavours are aimed at preventing the outbreak of war \r\nand maintaining peace. In that respect, the situation \r\nsurrounding the North Korean nuclear issue must be \r\nmanaged calmly so that tensions are not ratcheted up \r\ntoo far and accidental military clashes do not destroy \r\nthe peace. We should all remind ourselves of the words \r\nof former United States President Ronald Reagan: \r\n“Peace is not the absence of conflict, but the ability to \r\ncope with conflict by peaceful means”.\r\nI would like to make a special request to the States \r\nMembers of the United Nations and in particular to the \r\nSecurity Council. In order to fundamentally resolve the \r\nNorth Korean nuclear issue, the basic spirit of a secure \r\ncommunity enshrined in the Charter of the United \r\nNations should be fulfilled on the Korean peninsula and \r\nin North-East Asia. The pillars of security in North-East \r\nAsia and multilateralism should be wisely combined.\r\nThe spirit of the United Nations is realizing global \r\npeace through multilateral dialogue. The Korean \r\npeninsula is where that spirit is most desperately \r\nneeded. The realization of peace is what the United \r\nNations was created for, what it aims for and what it is \r\nin the process of achieving. We need the United Nations \r\nto play a more active role on the Korean peninsula. The \r\nmost important role the United Nations is being asked \r\nto play today is to come up with fundamental measures \r\nto end the vicious cycle of increased provocations and \r\nheightened sanctions.\r\nI have explained our new economic map for the \r\nKorean peninsula and new vision for the northern \r\neconomy many times. I believe that genuine peace \r\nand prosperity in North-East Asia will begin when \r\nthe foundation for a North-East Asian economic \r\ncommunity is solidified on one side and multilateral \r\nsecurity cooperation comes into being on the other.\r\nWhen the Olympic Games were reintroduced, \r\nin 1896, they had not been held for 1,500 years. The \r\nimpetus behind their revival was the thirst for peace. \r\nThe history of the modern Olympics started with the \r\noverwhelming emotion of the first Olympics, held \r\nin Athens on the Balkan peninsula, once a centre of \r\nconflict. Five months from now, the XXIII Olympic \r\nWinter Games will be held in PyeongChang, in the \r\nRepublic of Korea, the first of a series to be held in \r\nNorth-East Asia — PyeongChang in 2018, Tokyo \r\nin 2020 and Beijing in 2022. I hope that these three \r\nOlympics will offer an opportunity for promoting peace \r\nand economic cooperation in North-East Asia, where \r\nthe remnants of the Cold War and hope for the future, \r\nas well as confrontations and cooperation, coexist. \r\nThe Republic of Korea is ready to make every possible \r\neffort to that end.\r\nMr. Hilale (Morocco), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nI would ask members of the Assembly to imagine, \r\nfor one moment, people who love peace and sports \r\ngathering from all around the world in PyeongChang, \r\nwhich is only 100 kilometres from the demilitarized \r\nzone, the symbol of division and confrontation on the \r\nKorean peninsula. Heads of State and Government \r\nfrom all corners of the world will exchange greetings \r\nof friendship and harmony. My heart fills with joy \r\nwhen I imagine North Korean athletes marching into \r\nthe stadium during the opening ceremony, a South and \r\nNorth Korean joint cheering squad enthusiastically \r\nwelcoming them alongside the brightly smiling \r\nfaces of people from all over the world. It is not an \r\nimpossible dream.\r\nI will work wholeheartedly to turn that into a \r\nreality, in cooperation with the International Olympic \r\nCommittee, up until the last minute, in order to welcome \r\nNorth Koreans to the PyeongChang Winter Olympics. \r\nI hope that PyeongChang will become another candle \r\nto be lit. Like the candles the Korean people held out \r\nin the face of the crisis of democracy, I believe that \r\nPyeongChang will become a candle that sheds light on \r\npeace when peace is threatened. I hope that all Member \r\nStates and the United Nations will light their candles. I \r\nhope they will put their hearts and minds together to go \r\nhand in hand with peace.\r\nToday, with that heartfelt pledge, I invite all Heads \r\nof State and Government from around the world to \r\ncome to PyeongChang. The steps they take, together, \r\nwill become a march for peace. I look forward to seeing \r\nthem all in PyeongChang next year.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Korea for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Moon Jae-in, President of the Republic of Korea, \r\nwas escorted from the General Assembly Hall.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 11/26\r\nAddress by General Michel Aoun, President of the \r\nLebanese Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Lebanese Republic.\r\nGeneral Michel Aoun, President of the Lebanese \r\nRepublic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency General \r\nMichel Aoun, President of the Lebanese Republic, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Aoun (spoke in Arabic): At the outset, \r\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its current session. I wish him every \r\nsuccess in his endeavours. I also thank His Excellency \r\nMr. Peter Thomson for wisely guiding the work of the \r\nprevious session, and I commend Secretary-General \r\nGuterres for his efforts in revitalizing the role of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nToday we are in New York in September. We should \r\nthink back 16 years ago and remember when terrorism \r\nstruck this city, claiming the lives of thousands of \r\nvictims. From this very rostrum, we renew our solidarity \r\nwith the families of those victims and the families of all \r\nvictims of terrorism all over the world.\r\nThat tragic event ignited an international war \r\nagainst terrorism. That war has spread and has lost its \r\npurpose. Its raging fire has spread to other countries, \r\nespecially in the Middle East. Many countries have \r\nfelt that raging fire — some directly, while others have \r\nborne the burden of the results. It has fed the most \r\nheinous forms of terrorism, terrorism that seeks to \r\neliminate humankind, civilization and culture. It has \r\nperpetrated the most heinous crimes against our people. \r\nIt has spared no civilians, no children, no women, no old \r\npeople. It has spared no cultural or religious landmark. \r\nIt has also mushroomed and struck five continents, its \r\nmeans growing bloodier by the minute. Its crimes have \r\nviolated all laws, conventions and international norms. \r\nNo one knows where this terrorism will reach and how \r\nand when it will end.\r\nAs the war began in Syria, the situation in \r\nLebanon became destabilized. It was clear that, as an \r\nArab country, it was supposed to be drawn into the \r\ncircle of terrorism. However, Lebanon was able to \r\nprevent that horror, by preserving its unity despite its \r\nsevere political divisions. No one crossed the red line \r\nfacing every civilian, and that preserved the unity \r\nand security of Lebanon, despite the fact that some \r\nterrorists managed to infiltrate our towns and cities \r\nand organize armed cells there. With all of its forces, \r\nLebanon was gradually able to eliminate those terrorist \r\ncells. Recently, our army emerged victorious against \r\nthe terrorist organizations of Da’esh and Jabhat Fath \r\nAl-Sham and their armies, and ended their military \r\npresence in Lebanon.\r\nThe burden that the ongoing war in Syria has caused \r\nLebanon greatly exceeds our capacities. However, the \r\nLebanese people have proved that they are humane and \r\nresponsible. They have welcomed refugees into their \r\nhomes, schools and hospitals. They have shared their \r\nfood and their labour market with them throughout the \r\nyears of conflict to this very day, thereby drastically \r\nincreasing the country’s unemployment rate. I would \r\nlike to point out that more than half of our public \r\nschools operate in double shift,  morning and afternoon, \r\nin order to accommodate and educate Syrian children.\r\nLebanon is a small, densely populated country \r\nwith limited resources. Its economy has been affected \r\nby several crises — first,the global economic crisis, \r\nand then the regional wars that have surrounded our \r\ncountry and prevented it from turning to the East and \r\nthe Arab States that constitute our vital support. Waves \r\nof displaced people and refugees have been unleashed, \r\nincreasing the country’s population by a total of 50 per \r\ncent, which means that for every two Lebanese citizens \r\nthere is one displaced person or refugee. Our population \r\ndensity has increased from 400 to 600 people per square \r\nkilometre, resulting in severe overcrowding spread over \r\na total of 10,452 square kilometres. That has adversely \r\naffected our economy and led to an increase in the rates \r\nof various categories of crime.\r\nMore dangerous is the fact that terrorist groups \r\nhave taken shelter in refugee gathering areas and \r\ncamps, making them fertile terrain for carrying out \r\nterrorist activities and claiming the lives of innocent \r\npeople. We therefore need to regulate the return of \r\ndisplaced persons to their homeland. That need has \r\nbecome urgent as the situation in most of their original \r\nresidences has settled.\r\nThere are those who talk of voluntary return, while \r\nwe speak of safe return. There is a difference, and the \r\nmeetings of the International Syria Support Group have \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n12/26 17-29579\r\naffirmed that difference. Return is either voluntary or \r\nsafe, depending on the reasons for displacement. In the \r\ncase of individual or political asylum due to a threat \r\nto the safety and security of the individual, the return \r\nshould be voluntary. That is the case with political \r\nrefugees, who should themselves decide the timing of \r\ntheir return, which must be coupled with the acceptance \r\nof the host country.\r\nAs for the current form of collective asylum in \r\nLebanon, it has arisen for economic and security \r\nreasons, as an escape from the dangers of war. We \r\ntherefore call it displacement rather than asylum. It is \r\nnot coupled with the acceptance of the host country and \r\nis not limited to individual asylum; it is, rather, a form \r\nof population invasion. As for the claim that such people \r\nwill not be safe if they return to their country, we are \r\nall aware that it is a pretext and that it is unacceptable.\r\nOn the one hand, around 85 per cent of Syrian \r\nterritory has been recovered by the Government. On the \r\nother, if the Syrian Government is reconciling with the \r\narmed groups that it is fighting and granting them the \r\nfreedom to choose between remaining in their villages \r\nor moving to other regions, what will the Government \r\ndo with displaced persons who have f led the war? \r\nRecent events in Lebanon have confirmed that issue.\r\nOn top of this, the displaced are living in misery \r\nin an unhealthy environment, despite all the services \r\nprovided by the international and Lebanese institutions. \r\nIt is painful for us to be unable to improve their situation, \r\ngiven their great numbers and our limited capacities. \r\nThere is no doubt that it would be better if the United \r\nNations assisted them in returning to their homeland \r\nrather than helping them to remain in camps that lack \r\nbasic decent living standards.\r\nIn addition to the Syrian exodus and the impending \r\nfinancial collapse of the United Nations Relief and \r\nWorks Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near \r\nEast (UNRWA), Lebanon is burdened by the 500,000 \r\nPalestinian refugees who have been displaced from \r\ntheir homeland for 69 years and are still waiting to \r\nreturn to Palestine. We see no serious effort on the \r\npart of the United Nations in general, and the Security \r\nCouncil in particular, to implement a two-State \r\nsolution. On the contrary, the international community, \r\nwith all of its institutions, is unable to compel Israel to \r\nstop building new settlements. The violence continues \r\nunabated because people whose identity and land have \r\nbeen stolen cannot be subjugated.\r\nIsrael’s approach to the solution has always been \r\nbased on military force and violation of others’ rights. \r\nLebanon is a case in point. Israel has repeatedly \r\nviolated both Lebanese sovereignty and resolution 1701 \r\n(2006). Some days ago, the Israeli air force bombed \r\nSyrian territory from Lebanese air space. A few \r\ndays later, it carried out an imaginary raid, breaking \r\nthe sound barrier above Saïda and causing material \r\ndamage. Moreover, from time to time Israel installs \r\nspying devices in Lebanese territory. Those violations \r\nare not new. Israel has been doing such things for seven \r\ndecades now. Records show that there are at least 100 \r\nland, sea and air violations of Lebanese sovereignty \r\neach and every month. Lebanon has lodged complaints \r\nwith the Security Council, but so far has been unable to \r\nstop those violations.\r\nThese seven decades of war with Israel have shown \r\nthat cannons, tanks and planes do not achieve solutions \r\nor peace. There can be no peace without rights and there \r\ncan be no justice without respect for rights. It is clear \r\nthat the crime of expelling Palestinians from their land \r\nand displacing them cannot be rectified by committing \r\nthe additional crime of compelling Lebanon to impose \r\nnaturalization on Palestinians and denying them the \r\nright of return. The weakening of UNRWA’s role is \r\na step towards that goal, seeking to end their refugee \r\nstatus in preparation for their resettlement. Lebanon \r\nwill not allow that to happen. We will refuse to take \r\nin those refugees and displaced persons, whatever \r\nhappens. The choice is ours and ours alone to make.\r\nAll these wars have left deep wounds in our society \r\nand citizens. They have destroyed civil attitudes and \r\nthe principles of coexistence, solidarity, tolerance and \r\nacceptance among individuals and groups worldwide. \r\nOur region has become trapped in a cycle of poverty \r\nand is becoming a hotbed of extremism, thereby \r\ncreating continually deteriorating crises. Any solution \r\nmust therefore be coupled with economic and social \r\nmeasures that can boost growth, improve social \r\nconditions and ensure a decent and stable life for the \r\npeople of the region.\r\nI therefore call on Members to seriously consider \r\nestablishing a common market to ensure that we do not \r\nlive outside the shadow of freedom. Lebanon is itself a \r\nmodel of diversity. Its people, cultures and civilizations \r\nhave always been diverse. They are the result of an \r\namalgamation born in ancient times — from Aramaic, \r\nthe language of Jesus Christ, to Arabic, the language \r\nof the prophet, in addition to Phoenician, Roman, \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 13/26\r\nGreek, Latin, Persian and Coptic. We must not forget \r\nthat the Lebanese people have long brought Muslims \r\nand Christians of different sects together. Despite a \r\nhistory of war and its repercussions, we have enjoyed \r\npeace and its positive aspects. Given our experience in \r\ncoexistence and our comprehensive culture, Lebanon \r\ncan be an oasis where the world can meet and engage \r\nin dialogue.\r\nAfter the end of the First World War, the League \r\nof Nations was established to maintain world peace. \r\nHowever, it failed and the Second World War broke \r\nout only two decades later. At the end of that war, the \r\nUnited Nations was established with the main objective \r\nof peacefully resolving disputes among countries and \r\npreventing future wars. But has it been successful in \r\nachieving that goal? The answer to that question is not \r\ndifficult. The explosive world around us is the answer.\r\nWorld War Three has assumed a new form. It is no \r\nlonger a war among nations, but rather a devastating \r\ninternal war. Many countries have exploded for religious \r\nand ethnic reasons related to extremism and the rejection \r\nof others’ rights to exist. As for the division of States \r\ninto sectarian and ethnic groups, it is definitely not the \r\nsolution and will never prevent wars. On the contrary, \r\nthat approach can serve only to increase fanaticism, \r\nextremism and conflict. The solution will come only \r\nthrough intellectual and cultural change.\r\nHence the urgent need for an institution \r\ndedicated to providing peace education. That has \r\nbecome crucial, since only a new culture of peace \r\nand forgiveness that teaches the principles of living \r\ntogether — also known as coexistence, in which people \r\nrespect freedom of conscience and the right to hold \r\ndiffering opinions — can confront terrorism and create \r\nsocieties capable of establishing peace among people \r\nand nations; a culture that brings people together and \r\ncontributes to strengthening relations among different \r\nsocieties; a culture that assists in adopting the language \r\nof dialogue as a means of conflict resolution.\r\nThe role and mission of Lebanon is to wage war \r\nagainst the ideology of terrorism. Lebanon, in its \r\npluralistic society, is the antithesis of the unilateralism \r\nrepresented by Da’esh and its peers. That is the basic \r\neffort that the United Nations must undertake — to \r\nintellectually fight terrorism, which has no geographic \r\nborders. It is an intellectual infection, transmitted \r\nelectronically around the world.\r\nFor all of those reasons, I propose Lebanon’s \r\ncandidacy as a permanent centre, independent of \r\nthe United Nations, for dialogue among different \r\ncivilizations, religions and races. We hope that Member \r\nStates will support Lebanon when that proposal is \r\nsubmitted so that we can work together to secure the \r\naspirations of the United Nations as an institution and \r\nas nations seeking peace and a decent life for all people \r\nin a world of security and stability.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Lebanese Republic for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nGeneral Michel Aoun, President of the Lebanese \r\nRepublic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of \r\nthe Republic of Cyprus.\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the President of the Republic of Cyprus.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Nicos Anastasiades, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Anastasiades: At the outset, I would \r\nlike to convey my Government’s congratulations to \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session and \r\nassure him of our unwavering support for his mandate.\r\nAt the same time, I would like to once again \r\ncongratulate Secretary-General António Guterres \r\non his assumption of his duties since 1 January. The \r\nGovernment of Cyprus and I personally have full faith \r\nand confidence in his abilities and vision. To that end, \r\nwe stand ready to provide all necessary assistance \r\ntowards achieving our shared goal of promoting the \r\nvalues and principles of the United Nations at a time \r\nmarked by great uncertainty and instability.\r\nLike the years preceding it, 2017 has been marked \r\nby turbulence. To name only a few examples, terrorism, \r\nregional conflicts, forced migration, the alarming \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n14/26 17-29579\r\neffects of climate change and humanitarian crises are \r\nrealities that have placed an enormous strain on our \r\npeoples and the environment. Human nature drives us \r\nto work for what is in our best interests and those of \r\nfuture generations — the preservation of our planet, \r\npeaceful settlements of conflicts, an end to terrorism \r\nand extremism, action to prevent natural disasters, \r\nand joint efforts to alleviate the immeasurable human \r\nsuffering experienced around the world.\r\nThere is only one way to achieve that, and it is \r\nmultilateralism. We stand here as world leaders to \r\npledge our determination and commitment to a better \r\nworld, through cooperation and joint actions. It is only \r\nthrough collective efforts that we can address crises \r\nlike the current one with North Korea, which threatens \r\nthe resilience of our global non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament regimes, as well as the peace and security \r\narchitecture of the region and beyond.\r\nInternational multilateral cooperation is also vital \r\nin dealing with the scourge of terrorism. Terrorist \r\nattacks have unfortunately become commonplace in \r\nour world, from Baghdad to Kabul, from Paris to Cairo, \r\nfrom Barcelona to London. They target our cities and \r\ncitizens with cowardly acts of asymmetric aggression. \r\nAlong with adopting enhanced security measures, it is \r\nessential to prevent and counter radicalization and violent \r\nextremism within our societies through education, \r\ndialogue, economic growth and social inclusion.\r\nThere is no security without development, and there \r\nis no development without security. Enhancing our \r\nsocieties’ resilience is a key aspect of our multilateral \r\nendeavours, and in that respect our determination \r\nto implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment must remain high on the list of priorities. \r\nSustainable development is at the heart of dealing \r\nwith the root causes of forced migration, which for the \r\npast two years has dominated the global agenda, and \r\nnot without cause. The crisis is putting pressure on \r\nour societies as well as our Governments, while at the \r\nsame time it is changing the way political dialogue is \r\nconducted. However overwhelming the situation may \r\nbe, we must not lose sight of the big picture, which is \r\nthe need for solidarity and burden-sharing.\r\nAll these issues, along with the additional challenges \r\nthat we are facing, point in one direction. We need a \r\njust, effective and efficient global governance system. \r\nIn that regard, we are here to renew our commitment \r\nto a global order based on international law, with the \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations at its \r\ncore — a global order that ensures that peace, security, \r\nhuman rights and sustainable development remain the \r\nhighest values that we subscribe to, preserve and uphold. \r\nCyprus believes that the reform priorities that the \r\nSecretary-General has laid out are essential to ensuring \r\nthatmultilateralism remains relevant and effective in a \r\ntime of growing scepticism and isolationist tendencies.\r\nThe three pillars of reform, in distinct yet parallel \r\nand complementary processes, will, if successful, \r\nprovide us with a changed narrative pertaining to the \r\nability to prevent crises before they erupt, reinforcing \r\nand enhancing peacekeeping and peacebuilding, \r\nhumanitarian assistance and long-term development \r\nand growth.\r\nThe theme of this year’s session of the General \r\nAssembly — ”Focusing on people: Striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable \r\nplanet” — is extremely relevant to my country, which is \r\nstill suffering from the scourge of war and its ongoing \r\nviolent division. In that regard, we firmly believe that \r\nthe most vital element in achieving inter-State, regional \r\nand global peace is respecting and ensuring the full \r\nand unhindered independence, territorial integrity \r\nand sovereignty of each and every State Member of \r\nthe United Nations — a pillar that constitutes one of \r\nthe most indispensable provisions of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the most basic rule aimed at \r\nprohibiting foreign intervention in the territory, the \r\nexclusive economic zone or the internal affairs of \r\nindependent and sovereign States Members of the \r\nUnited Nations. It is only by adhering to that standard \r\nthat we can avoid inter-State conflicts and bloody \r\ninternal clashes, which in turn establish the conditions \r\nfor prolonged destabilization, violence and uncertainty.\r\nOne country that unfortunately continues to endure \r\nthe consequences of blatant violations of fundamental \r\nprinciples of the United Nations is mine, the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, which since the 1974 military invasion of \r\nTurkey has remained under its occupation. The pretext \r\nfor the invasion was the restoration of constitutional \r\norder following the attempted coup d’état against the \r\nPresident of the Republic by the Greek military junta. I \r\nhave deliberately used the word “pretext” since, instead \r\nof restoring the constitutional order, Turkey ended up \r\noccupying 37 per cent of the territory of Cyprus, while \r\nforcibly displacing more than a third of the Greek \r\nCypriot community from their ancestral homeland. \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 15/26\r\nThousands were murdered, and more than 1,000 Greek \r\nCypriots have been missing since 1974.\r\nBy the same use of force, all our Turkish Cypriot \r\ncompatriots were compelled by Turkey to relocate from \r\nthe areas controlled by the Government of Cyprus, in \r\nwhich they had been residing peacefully, to the areas \r\noccupied by Turkey. In the same context, through the \r\ncontinuous presence of more than 40,000 Turkish \r\ntroops and thousands of transplanted settlers, in a \r\nconscious effort to alter the demographic character of \r\nthe island, Turkey established an illegal entity under \r\nits absolute political, economic, cultural and religious \r\ncontrol and dominance.\r\nIt is not my intention to engage in a game of blame. \r\nOn the contrary, I truly wish that I were in the position \r\nto inform the Assembly that my vision of reaching a \r\nsettlement — one that I have repeatedly described from \r\nthis rostrum — has become a reality. Unfortunately, \r\ndespite our constructive approach, our tireless and \r\nunwavering efforts and the progress achieved, the most \r\nrecent rounds of talks, which were launched in May \r\n2015 and began to crescendo in July 2017 at Crans-\r\nMontana, have reached a deadlock, which is attributable \r\nexclusively to Turkey’s intransigent position, as \r\nreflected in its proposals aimed at reducing Cyprus \r\nto a Turkish protectorate instead of being positively \r\npredisposed to establishing a truly independent, \r\nsovereign and conventional State. One might consider \r\nmy previous comments to be exaggerated were I not \r\nable to substantiate them, as I intend to do now.\r\nIn 1960, with the establishment of the Republic of \r\nCyprus, among others, under the Treaty of Guarantee, \r\nTurkey, Great Britain and Greece set out to guarantee \r\nthe independence, territorial integrity and security of \r\nCyprus. In that regard, I should stress that Turkey’s \r\nexploitation of that provision has regrettably led to the \r\npain and suffering that the people of Cyprus — Greek \r\nand Turkish Cypriots alike — have endured and continue \r\nto endure as a consequence of the unacceptable status \r\nquo. It is for that exact reason that, since resuming \r\nnegotiations on establishing a normal and sovereign \r\nState and from the very beginning, we have made it \r\nour goal to terminate the Treaty of Guarantee and the \r\nright of intervention, as well as agree to a sunset clause \r\nfor full withdrawal of the foreign occupation troops. \r\nThat is a principled position that the Secretary-General \r\nhimself holds as an indispensable element in efforts to \r\nreach a settlement. As he said on 4 June,\r\n“Progress in this chapter [that is, the chapter \r\npertaining to security and guarantees] is an \r\nessential element in reaching an overall agreement \r\nand in building trust between the two communities \r\nin relation to their future security”.\r\nBased on both the observed progress in the \r\nbicommunal dialogue and the Secretary-General’s \r\nassessment, which I just cited, on 28 June the multilateral \r\nConference on Cyprus opened with great expectations. \r\nFollowing negotiations in an effort to positively support \r\nthe whole process, the Secretary-General presented an \r\noutline of six fundamental thematic topics comprising, \r\non the one hand, the chapter on security and guarantees, \r\nincluding the withdrawal of foreign troops, and, on the \r\nother hand, issues related to the internal aspects of the \r\nCyprus problem. Reaching the points of convergence \r\nwithin the Secretary-General’s framework would have \r\nled to a strategic agreement, thereby injecting a new \r\ndynamic and impetus into the process of realizing the \r\nvalid hope that an overall settlement might be feasible.\r\nIn full compliance with the Secretary-General’s \r\noutline, I submitted credible and realistic proposals \r\nthat effectively addressed the sensitivities and concerns \r\nof both communities, and that, like the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s framework, were based on the capacity of the \r\nRepublic of Cyprus as a State member of the European \r\nUnion (EU) and the United Nations. In stark contrast \r\nto the framework of the Secretary-General and the \r\npositions of the other two guarantor Powers, Turkey, in \r\nadopting an inflexible position, insisted on maintaining \r\nthe Treaty of Guarantee and the right of intervention, as \r\nwell as the permanent presence of troops.\r\nIn his statement before the General Assembly at \r\nits current session (see A/72/PV.4), the President of \r\nTurkey, Mr. Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, claimed that the \r\nunsuccessful outcome of negotiations at Crans-Montana \r\nwas attributable to the incomprehensible position of the \r\nGreek Cypriot side. In response, I would like to say \r\nthat I am sorry but I have to reply by asking the Turkish \r\nPresident the following questions.\r\nIs it incomprehensible to aspire to establish an \r\nindependent and sovereign State without foreign \r\nguarantees and the intervention of a third country, \r\nwhile enjoying freedom from the presence of \r\noccupation troops?\r\nIs it irrational to advocate establishing a normal \r\nState in which all decisions are made only by its \r\ncitizens, free from foreign dependencies?\r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n16/26 17-29579\r\nIs it unreasonable for an EU member State \r\nto efficiently and effectively participate in the \r\ndecision-making of the European Union?\r\nIs it unfounded to envision terminating the \r\nanachronistic Treaty of Guarantee and establishing \r\na robust security system based on the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and the relevant treaties of the European \r\nUnion and the Council of Europe?\r\nIs it against any established principle for the \r\nUnited Nations, as well as the relevant institutions of \r\nthe EU, to ensure and safeguard the smooth and secure \r\nimplementation of the provisions of the settlement? \r\nAnd is it a paradox to reject Turkey’s insistence that it \r\nshould assume that role?\r\nDoes any constitution of a federal State provide \r\nthat, for every decision at the federal level, at least one \r\npositive vote by the members of the State is required, \r\nespecially when one of the members of the federation is \r\ncontrolled by a third party?\r\nFinally, could anyone maintain that reaching a \r\nsettlement based on Turkey’s proposals would have led \r\nto establishing a functional and viable State?\r\nDespite our disappointment, what I want to \r\nemphatically stress and convey is that the vision of the \r\npeople of Cyprus is simply to end the unacceptable \r\nstatus quo and establish a federal State that would \r\nensure all generations of Greek and Turkish Cypriots \r\nconditions of stability for a safe, prosperous and \r\npeaceful future; a State free from any foreign \r\ninterventions and dependencies; a “normal State”, as the \r\nSecretary-General has very correctly stated; a State led \r\nby Cypriots for Cypriots. In that regard, and contrary \r\nto the statements made by Turkish officials, it is my \r\nintention, at tomorrow’s meeting with the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, to convey our readiness to immediately \r\nresume negotiations in accordance with his framework \r\nand in line with the relevant United Nations resolutions.\r\nWithin this context, it is widely acknowledged that \r\nif a new conference on Cyprus is to convene, and in \r\norder to avoid a repetition of the shortcomings of the \r\npast, there should be thorough and solid preparations \r\nand strong political will and determination on the part \r\nof all interested parties and stakeholders so as to ensure \r\nthat this time deliberations will lead to a positive \r\noutcome. For that, I have no doubt that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral and the permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil will offer us their support and help.\r\nAt the same time, at this critical juncture we need \r\nan alternative to unilateral actions that have a negative \r\neffect on the aim of moving the process forward. \r\nMutually agreed confidence-building measures that are \r\nin line with the relevant Security Council resolutions \r\nand reports of the Secretary-General, such as the return \r\nand resettlement of Varosha to its rightful and lawful \r\ninhabitants, would be game-changers in creating a \r\nclimate conducive to resuming negotiations with the \r\naim of reaching a comprehensive settlement. That aim \r\nwould be further reinforced through progress on the \r\nhumanitarian issue of missing persons. To that end, I \r\ncall on Turkey to fully cooperate in order to resolve \r\nthis tragic issue. I also take this opportunity to urge \r\nall countries that may hold information to open their \r\narchives in order to support our efforts to bring an end \r\nto this tragic aspect of the Cyprus problem.\r\nIn conclusion, I once again urge Turkey and our \r\nTurkish Cypriot compatriots to realize that it is only \r\nthrough mutual respect and compromises, not obsolete \r\nfixations on failed practices, that we will achieve a \r\nviable and lasting settlement that has neither winners nor \r\nlosers and fully respects and addresses the sensitivities \r\nand concerns of both communities. That is the only way \r\nfor Cyprus to fully utilize its potential and exploit its \r\nunique geographical position. That is my vision.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Cyprus for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Nicos Anastasiades, President of the Republic \r\nof Cyprus, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, \r\nPresident of Faso and President of the Council of \r\nMinisters of Burkina Faso\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nof Faso and President of the Council of Ministers of \r\nBurkina Faso.\r\nMr. Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, President of \r\nFaso and President of the Council of Ministers \r\nof Burkina Faso, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 17/26\r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Roch Marc \r\nChristian Kaboré, President of Faso and President of \r\nthe Council of Ministers of Burkina Faso, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kaboré (spoke in French): The seventy-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly is being held at \r\na time when the world’s ability to make progress faces \r\ncontinued significant challenges. The maintenance \r\nof international peace and security, the fight against \r\nterrorism and extremism, the eradication of poverty, \r\nand the achievement of sustainable development and \r\na fairer and more humane international order are our \r\nmain concerns today. They test us unremittingly, and \r\nwe have an urgent and pressing duty to provide rapid \r\nand sustainable solutions.\r\nMy delegation and I congratulate the President of \r\nthe General Assembly on his well-deserved election, \r\nand I would like to assure him of our full cooperation \r\nin his successful conduct of his work. I also thank his \r\npredecessor for his effective execution of his mandate.\r\n I would also like to pay tribute to Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres who, during his first few months at \r\nthe head of our Organization, has demonstrated his \r\nfully committment to peace and development and his \r\nresolve to pursue the ambitious goal of revitalizing the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nTwo years ago we adopted the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) in order to give a new \r\nglobal momentum to peace, prosperity, development, \r\njustice and humanism. The entry into force of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change was welcome in that \r\nregard. The establishment of a follow-up and review \r\nmechanism for the implementation of the SDGs, as \r\nwell as the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment to monitor the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, are also \r\nreal achievements.\r\nDespite those successes, obstacles remain on the \r\npath to building a world of peace and prosperity. I \r\nwould therefore stress the importance of our theme this \r\nsession, which restores the human individual to the heart \r\nof our global development and governance policies.\r\nWe cannot forget that every day in Africa, in \r\nmy country and in others, men and women are dying \r\nbecause of a lack of care or food, children are not \r\nenjoying the fundamental right to education, young \r\npeople are reduced to facing the rage of the seas and \r\noceans to seek a better future, and entire populations \r\nare condemned to wander endlessly as victims of \r\nconflicts and disaster, all against the backdrop of an \r\ninternational context overshadowed by terrorism and \r\nextreme violence. Obviously, it is now more important \r\nthan ever to change our paradigms, in our conduct of \r\nboth domestic and international affairs, in order to move \r\nfrom rhetoric to action and a results-based approach.\r\nThe success of the round table of public and \r\nprivate donors to our national plan for economic and \r\nsocial development, following the appeal that I made \r\nat this forum on 22 September 2016 (see A/71/PV.15), \r\nspeaks to our partners’ confidence in my country. I \r\nwould like to take this opportunity to offer them our \r\ndeep gratitude. Burkina Faso is engaged in a process of \r\neconomic recovery through major structural reforms, \r\nand one of the objectives is to attract, facilitate and \r\nsecure investments.\r\nWith a view to strengthening our participatory \r\ndemocracy by putting citizens in charge of the \r\nfunctioning of the State, Burkina Faso joined the \r\nPartnership for an Open Government in 2016. In that \r\ncontext, we are drawing up our first national action plan \r\nto strengthen the fight against corruption and improve \r\nour quality of governance, in a spirit of cooperation \r\nwith non-State actors, civil-society organizations and \r\nthe media. At the same time, an array of reforms aimed \r\nat strengthening our democracy and optimizing our \r\ninstitutions is moving ahead smoothly. A preliminary \r\ndraft constitution has been prepared by representatives \r\nof every sector of society, and the judiciary is working \r\nindependently to resolve the political and economic \r\ndisputes and crimes that have plagued our national \r\nreconciliation efforts for decades.\r\nTargeted for some time by terrorist and obscurantist \r\nforces, my country is fully aware of their clearly \r\nstated intention to destabilize it and all the countries \r\nof the region. The fight against terrorism is therefore \r\na national priority, and will succeed if it is part not \r\nonly of a subregional approach but also in a context of \r\neconomic development in the most vulnerable areas.\r\nWe are therefore paying particular attention \r\nto the north of our country. While there have been \r\nsome operational successes there, we must bolster \r\nthem through the emergency investment programme \r\nthat we recently adopted as a way to reduce the \r\nvulnerability of populations, especially young people \r\nand women. However — and we cannot reiterate this \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n18/26 17-29579\r\nenough — terrorism is above all a global scourge. \r\nGiven that it strikes without discrimination, it calls \r\nfor a clear and firm condemnation from all of us and \r\nan effective collective response based on solidarity \r\nand shared efforts and means. That is the raison d’être \r\nof the Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), whose \r\noperationalization we are working to accelerate, as the \r\ninauguration on 10 September in Sévaré, Mali, of the \r\nG-5 Sahel Force Command Centre demonstrated.\r\nI also welcomed the Security Council’s adoption \r\nof resolution 2359 (2017) on 21 June. However, given \r\nthe gravity of the situation in the area, we must seize \r\nthe opportunity offered by the consideration of the \r\nSecretary-General’s forthcoming follow-up report \r\nto strengthen the mandate of the Multinational Joint \r\nTask Force by providing it with the means necessary \r\nto achieve its mission. Similarly, we welcome the \r\nestablishment of the Sahel Alliance, whose first high-\r\nlevel meeting is scheduled for October.\r\nOne of the major challenges in that regard remains \r\nthe mobilization of resources, as we stressed at the \r\nhigh-level meeting held on 18 September here in New \r\nYork, under the auspices of the Secretary-General, on \r\nthe situation in the Sahel. We hope that the international \r\nplanning conference provided for in resolution 2359 \r\n(2017), to be held in Brussels in December, will fulfil \r\nall its promises.\r\nThe quest for peace must remain at the heart of our \r\ncommon action, especially that of our Organization. \r\nIn Africa, many hotbeds of tension persist. While we \r\nwelcome the recent political developments in Mali, it \r\nshould be noted that the security situation in the north \r\nof that country remains highly precarious. I hope \r\nthat the establishment of a sanctions regime by the \r\nSecurity Council on 5 September, at the request of the \r\nGovernment of Mali, will be an effective additional \r\nlever for the implementation of the Agreement on \r\nPeace and Reconciliation in Mali. We invite all the \r\nforces present in Mali — including the National Armed \r\nForces, the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in Mali, Operation Barkhane and \r\nthe G-5 Sahel force — to work in good faith and in full \r\ncoordination in order to expedite the definitive return \r\nof peace and security to the region.\r\nMr. Rabary-Njaka (Madagascar), Vice-President, \r\ntook the Chair.\r\nWe must remain mobilized to bring to a successful \r\nconclusion the processes of conflict resolution or exit \r\nfrom the crises in Libya, the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo, the Central African Republic, Somalia, \r\nSouth Sudan and Burundi. We call on the various \r\nprotagonists to promote dialogue and reconciliation, \r\nand to recognize that they will be the primary owners \r\nand architects of peace in their countries. Concerning \r\nthe question of Western Sahara, Burkina Faso reiterates \r\nits call for dialogue and negotiation, in a spirit of \r\ncompromise, with a view to achieving a political and \r\nrealistic settlement of the dispute.\r\nThe Palestinian issue continues to be a major \r\nconcern. I welcomed the holding in January of the Paris \r\nConference, which reaffirmed a solution whereby two \r\nStates, Israel and Palestine, should live side by side in \r\npeace and within secure and internationally recognized \r\nborders. The commitment of both parties is the only \r\nway to end the conflict and achieve a peaceful and \r\ndefinitive settlement.\r\nThe efforts of the international community in Iraq, \r\nSyria and Yemen must be intensified if we do not wish \r\nto see that part of the world sink into perpetual chaos. \r\nBurkina Faso is also concerned about the situation in \r\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council. It urges the protagonists \r\nto give priority to dialogue and negotiation in order to \r\nend to that crisis.\r\nBurkina Faso condemns North Korea’s nuclear \r\ntests, which pose a threat to the peace and security of the \r\nKorean peninsula and the world. We urge that country \r\nto respect the resolutions of the Security Council, and \r\nhope that the logic of dialogue and negotiation will \r\nprevail over that of escalation and confrontation.\r\nIn that context, I reaffirm my country’s commitment \r\nto general and complete disarmament and its support for \r\nthe efforts of the United Nations to that end, in relation \r\nboth to weapons of mass destruction and conventional \r\nweapons. In that regard, I urge all countries, especially \r\nthose whose ratification is required, to prioritize the \r\nentry into force of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-\r\nBan Treaty as soon as possible. The adoption of the \r\nTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons on 7 July \r\nshould give further impetus to that effort.\r\nThe proliferation of small arms and light weapons \r\nposes one of the main threats to international peace and \r\nsecurity. My country, which actively participated in the \r\ndevelopment of the Arms Trade Treaty, is convinced \r\nthat its implementation will help to eradicate that \r\nscourge, which is a genuine obstacle to the development \r\nof our States.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 19/26\r\nMultilateralism is the tool par excellence of \r\ndialogue and solidarity among peoples. In that regard, \r\nthe international community would certainly benefit \r\nfrom the Republic of China on Taiwan’s effective and \r\nbroader participation in the specialized agencies and \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations system. In the name \r\nof that same dialogue and solidarity, which characterize \r\npeaceful relations among the actors on the international \r\nstage, Burkina Faso is in favour of the total lifting of \r\nthe embargo on Cuba so that Havana and Washington, \r\nD.C., can maintain mutually beneficial partnership \r\nrelations.\r\nUnited Nations reform remains a central issue for the \r\nworld’s governing body. We must approach it with the \r\ncourage and serenity that seeing justice done for Africa \r\nrequires, particularly with regard to its representation \r\non the Security Council. That accords with the African \r\nCommon Position and our Organization’s necessary \r\nadaptation to a changing world. At a time of such \r\nuncertainty and upheaval, we must shoulder our \r\nresponsibility to give our citizens reason to believe that \r\na better future lies ahead and that we can bequeath a \r\nsafer world to the next generation.\r\nThe United Nations is the best instrument we \r\nhave for that. Let us all commit here and now to \r\nmaking the United Nations stronger, more modern \r\nand more efficient. In that regard, we know that we \r\ncan count on the Secretary-General’s commitment and \r\ndetermination. I firmly believe that he will play his \r\npart in implementing bold reforms so that the United \r\nNations can be a genuine Organization of the people.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof Faso and President of the Council of Ministers of \r\nBurkina Faso for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Roch Marc Christian Kaboré, President of \r\nFaso and President of the Council of Ministers \r\nof Burkina Faso, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Ghana.\r\n Mr. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Nana Addo \r\nDankwa Akufo-Addo, President of the Republic of \r\nGhana, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Akufo-Addo: It has been 60 years \r\nsince my country, Ghana, became a Member of the \r\nOrganization. We joined when we became independent, \r\nsome 12 years after the first meeting of the Organization \r\nin San Francisco, and Ghana has been an active \r\nparticipant in the United Nations ever since.\r\n I want to thank the United Nations for the honour \r\ndone Ghana by my appointment by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral as co-Chair of the advocacy group of \r\neminent persons for the United Nations Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), to continue in the position \r\nthat was held by my predecessor as President, His \r\nExcellency Mr. John Dramani Mahama. That mark of \r\ntrust in Ghana’s leaders is a matter of justifiable pride \r\nfor the Ghanian people, a trust I pledge to uphold.\r\nOn 25 September 2015, when the SDGs were \r\nadopted, there were sceptics who feared that the Goals \r\nwere too many and too complex to be successfully \r\ntackled, even with concerted effort. The lesson that we \r\nhave learned from the experience of the Organization, \r\nhowever, is that once the world puts its collective mind \r\nto something, the chances are that we will get it right. \r\nEvery day, something happens to bring home to us, the \r\ninhabitants of the planet, that we are in it together.\r\nThere is no better or more dramatic indication of \r\nthat truth than the images that have recently dominated \r\nour television screens of devastation caused by f loods \r\nin Houston, Texas; Dhaka, Bangladesh; Mumbai, India; \r\nPalpa, Nepal; Dominica, Puerto Rico, Antigua and \r\nBarbuda and Saint Martin, all in the Caribbean, and \r\nNiamey, in the Niger. One of the most modern cities in \r\nthe richest, most powerful nation on our Earth suffered \r\nthe same fate as did Niamey in the Sahel region of \r\nAfrica, one of the poorest parts of the world. At the \r\nheight of the raging storms, one thing became clear. \r\nIt did not matter if you were in the richest or poorest \r\npart of the world, the awesome power of nature was on \r\ndisplay and we humans came across as the same sad \r\ncreatures at the mercy of nature.\r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n20/26 17-29579\r\nAs I watched and listened along with the rest of the \r\nworld, it occurred to me that taken altogether, the SDGs \r\nare indeed a worthy set of Goals for the world. They \r\nbear repeating — no poverty, zero hunger, good health \r\nand well-being, quality education, clean water and \r\nsanitation, decent work and economic growth, industry, \r\ninnovation and infrastructure, reduced inequality, \r\nsustainable cities and communities, responsible \r\nconsumption and production, life below water, life \r\non land, peace, justice and strong institutions, to be \r\nachieved through partnerships for the Goals. We should \r\nwork hard to achieve the Goals; the world will be a \r\nmuch better place.\r\nGhana was the first country in sub-Saharan Africa \r\nto gain its freedom from colonial rule. This year marks \r\nthe sixtieth anniversary of its independence, and it is \r\nauspicious that I am addressing the Assembly for the \r\nfirst time on the birthday of our historic first President \r\nKwame Nkrumah — the day we have set aside to \r\ncommemorate him.\r\nWe believe that it is time Africa came of age and \r\nheld its rightful place on the world stage. Africa will \r\nbe neither a pawn nor a victim. This Africa will be \r\nhonest with itself and with the world. It will shed its \r\ncloak of poverty and become prosperous. We are under \r\nno illusions about the hard work it will take to achieve \r\nour stated goals, but we are not afraid of hard work. We \r\nknow that the critical ingredient in making sustainable \r\neconomic progress is to ensure a stable, democratic \r\nsystem of Government.\r\nI believe that we are making that progress in Ghana. \r\nAfter years of political turmoil and accompanying \r\neconomic chaos, a consensus has emerged in our \r\nFourth Republic. We have had political stability for \r\nthe past 25 years and a multiparty democracy in which \r\nregular elections are now an accepted feature of our \r\ngovernance. I am here today because of elections last \r\nDecember, in which the people of Ghana voted out an \r\nincumbent Government and gave me and my party the \r\nmandate and honour to govern our nation for the next \r\nfour years. We continue to be a beacon of democracy \r\nand stability on the continent. Our institutions of State \r\nare growing stronger and we have made more progress \r\nwith our economy than at any time since independence.\r\nWe are nowhere near where we want to be, but \r\nwe are determined to realize our potential and make \r\nGhana a prosperous nation. There will always be the \r\nadventurous among us Ghanaians who would want to \r\nseek challenges in different parts of the world. We wish \r\nthem well, and expect that wherever they go they will be \r\nwelcomed and treated with dignity. But we are working \r\nto grow our economy and open up opportunities for \r\nall our citizens. No longer should Ghanaians feel that \r\nthey have to subject themselves to the intolerable \r\nand inhumane conditions of crossing the Sahara and \r\ndrowning in the Mediterranean in hopes of making a \r\nliving in Europe.\r\nWe have just started the free senior high school \r\nprogramme that aims to guarantee secondary education \r\nfor all of Ghana’s children. It will ensure that all our \r\nchildren will be educated at least to the secondary \r\nlevel, and that money, or the lack of it, will no longer \r\nmean being denied an education. That has already led \r\nto an increase of more than 90,000 children entering \r\nsecondary school in the current academic year \r\nwho would otherwise have dropped out at by now. \r\nSustainable Development Goal 4, which aims to ensure \r\ninclusive, equitable, quality education and promote \r\nlifelong learning opportunities for all, will be within \r\nour reach by the target date. We do not want to be a scar \r\non anybody’s conscience. We want to build an economy \r\nthat is not dependent on charity and handouts. Long \r\nand bitter experience has taught us that no matter how \r\ngenerous the charity, we would remain poor.\r\nWe want to build a Ghana that looks to the use \r\nof its own resources and their proper management as \r\nthe way to engineer social and economic growth in \r\nthe country. We want to build an economy that looks \r\npast commodities in order to position our country \r\nin the global marketplace. We are not rejecting aid, \r\nbut we do want to discard a mindset of dependency \r\nand living on handouts. We want to build a Ghana \r\nbeyond aid. It is an easier platform on which to build \r\nsustainable relationships.\r\nIn talking about sustainable relations, Africa and, \r\nindeed, Ghana are committed to ensuring that we remain \r\na continent free of nuclear weapons. Three weeks ago, \r\nhighly enriched uranium was f lown out of Ghana back \r\nto China, signalling the end of the removal of all such \r\nmaterial from the country. Our nuclear reactor has since \r\nbeen converted to using low-enriched fuel for power \r\ngeneration. A world free of nuclear weapons is in our \r\ncollective interest.\r\nI wish to reaffirm my country’s commitment to \r\nmaintaining friendly and cordial relations with all \r\nthe countries and peoples of the world. Ghana’s full \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 21/26\r\nengagement, through the Economic Community of \r\nWest African States, in the process of West African \r\nintegration, and through the African Union, in the \r\nprocess of African integration, remains a goal of my \r\nGovernment. Regional and continental integration are \r\nin Ghana’s interest, as they represent one of the surest \r\nways of establishing the conditions for prosperity on the \r\ncontinent in the decades ahead. They will also help to \r\nensure security and combat the scourges of terrorism, \r\nextremism and intolerance.\r\nThe conflicts that continue to plague our continent \r\nin Libya, South Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and Mali would be more effectively resolved if \r\nthe international community were to support and not \r\nundermine the efforts of our regional and continental \r\norganizations to deal with them. Ghana will also \r\ncontinue to be active in the multilateral organizations \r\nto which we belong, such as La Francophonie, the \r\nCommonwealth of Nations and the United Nations, \r\nbecause we believe multilateral action and international \r\ncooperation are in our common interest.\r\nWe want to build a Ghana that will enable our people \r\nto deal with the rest of the world on an equal playing \r\nfield. I am saying nothing new when I draw attention \r\nto the urgent need to reform the Organization. While it \r\nhas been talked about and scheduled for a long time, we \r\nhave somehow never found the courage or the will to \r\nreform the United Nations. Ghana supports the process \r\nof United Nations reform, especially of the Security \r\nCouncil, as set out in the African Common Position \r\non United Nations reform, based on the Ezulwini \r\nConsensus. The time is long overdue to correct the \r\nlong-standing injustice that the current structure and \r\ncomposition of the Security Council represents for the \r\nnations of Africa.\r\nWe cannot continue to preach democracy and \r\nfairness and insist on peace and justice around the \r\nworld when our global Organization is not seen by the \r\nmajority of its Member States as having a structure \r\nthat is just and fair. Indeed, many see it as helping to \r\nperpetuate an unfair world order. The Organization \r\nprovides the best vehicle for the world to manage its \r\nmany and varied problems, and we would undermine \r\nits credibility and fail in our duty if we did not reform \r\nthe United Nations. Let us not dare to let ourselves and \r\nfuture generations down. The time for reform has come.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Ghana for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, President \r\nof the Republic of Ghana, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Gabonese Republic.\r\nMr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the \r\nGabonese Republic, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Ali Bongo \r\nOndimba, President of the Gabonese Republic, and to \r\ninvite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Bongo Ondimba (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, let me congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on \r\nhis outstanding election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. I wish to assure \r\nhim of Gabon’s support in his fulfilment of the mandate \r\nentrusted to him. I also commend the valuable work of \r\nhis predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson.\r\nIt is a privilege for me to convey my warm \r\ncongratulations to the new Secretary-General, \r\nMr. António Guterres. I believe firmly that his rich and \r\nlong experience is a valuable asset to our Organization, \r\nand I welcome his special emphasis on conflict \r\nprevention in his inaugural speech.\r\nThe theme of the general debate of this session, \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”, lies at the very heart \r\nof our priorities. It reminds us all of the place that the \r\nhuman individual must occupy in our respective actions \r\nand of our obligation to reconcile development and \r\ndurable peace with the preservation of the environment \r\nfor present and future generations. It is up to us all to \r\nact to fashion a human species for whom a decent life \r\nfor all will be self-evident.\r\nAlong with security, peace is an essential \r\nprerequisite for the development of Africa, including \r\nmy country of Gabon. In that connection, Africa \r\ncontinues to occupy the lion’s share of the Security \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n22/26 17-29579\r\nCouncil’s agenda, and my country therefore endorses \r\nthe African position in favour of a permanent seat for \r\nAfrica on the Council.\r\nInasmuch as peace is essential at the international \r\nlevel, peace and security at the national level are \r\nthe basic ingredients for development and for the \r\nparticipation of all in the democratic debate. Gabon is \r\na country that bears the stamp of peace, and we want \r\nto remain the haven of fraternity and solidarity that we \r\nhave always been. That is why, at the beginning of the \r\nyear, I convened a political dialogue to which I invited \r\nall of the nation’s most prominent persons. Everyone \r\nwho participated in the dialogue was able to candidly \r\ndiscuss all of our country’s important issues and desired \r\nreforms. We reached compromises that were difficult \r\nbut also dynamic and necessary — on the voting system, \r\nelectoral procedures and the organization of powers. \r\nMoreover, the implementation of the conclusions \r\nof the political dialogue has already begun, with the \r\nrecent formation of a new Government that includes \r\nrepresentatives from the opposition and civil society.\r\nWith the adoption first of the Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals and, subsequently, of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs), the Organization is \r\ncontinuing its efforts to mobilize the international \r\ncommunity in order to offer humankind a decent life on \r\na preserved planet. Beyond such declarations, however, \r\nif we are to achieve the SDGs, the time has come to give \r\nthe Organization the resources it needs to carry out its \r\nwork through predictable and sustained financing.\r\nAs for Gabon, the new Government is operating \r\nunder a framework entitled “Emerging Gabon 2025: \r\na vision, a strategy, a road map”, aimed at achieving \r\nsustainable development and diversifying the national \r\neconomy. That approach, which seeks to reduce the \r\ncountry’s dependence on extractive industries and \r\ndampen the volatility of raw-material prices, is already \r\ntaking shape through an industrial base that is creating \r\njobs and wealth, the Nkok special economic zone.\r\nGabon has not been spared from the crisis that has \r\naffected our entire planet and that has been reflected in \r\nan economic slowdown that has had a negative impact on \r\nemployment, particularly for young people. In response, \r\nwe have adopted an economic recovery programme \r\naimed at providing new economic momentum through \r\nmeasures that adjust the budget, develop infrastructure \r\nand encourage the private sector to leverage our \r\neconomy’s diversification and transformation.\r\nNevertheless, my Government is striving to offer \r\nthe people of Gabon better living conditions through a \r\nnumber of measures, ranging from reducing the prices \r\nof food staples to building new hospitals. I have also \r\ninitiated an equal-opportunity programme that will \r\nenable all Gabonese people to enjoy the same resources \r\nas they embark on a path of personal and collective \r\nfulfilment. To that end, I have placed women’s \r\nempowerment at the heart of the Government’s agenda.\r\nThe future of our planet will depend on our \r\ndetermination to honour the commitments that we \r\nundertook in the Paris Agreement during the twenty-\r\nfirst Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change. We do not \r\nhave the right to disappoint our peoples at this historic \r\nmoment, because the challenges posed by global \r\nwarming are not simply environmental in nature — they \r\nare also political, economic and security challenges. \r\nWe have even less right to disappoint our peoples, given \r\nthat the reality that we may wish to ignore calls attention \r\nto itself every day with increasingly brutal force, in \r\nthe form of all the recent environmental disasters. \r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express the \r\ncondolences and moral support of the people of Gabon \r\nto the countries that have been victims of the recent \r\nhurricanes and cyclones, as well as the victims of the \r\nearthquake in Mexico.\r\nGabon will not deviate from its path. Our public \r\npolicies will continue to be aimed at managing our \r\nresources responsibly and sustainably. In that spirit, \r\nmy country has just created 20 marine protected areas \r\nin addition to our existing 13 national parks on land. I \r\nhave also instructed the Government to strengthen its \r\nreforestation policy so as to ensure the sustainability \r\nof our forests. With regard to my country’s ongoing \r\ncommitment to those key issues, I have agreed to \r\nlead the Committee of African Heads of State and \r\nGovernment on Climate Change for the next two years, \r\nfollowing the term of my Egyptian brother President Al \r\nSisi. I will be responsible for bringing Africa’s voice to \r\nall climate-change negotiations.\r\nAt the subregional level, my peers have also \r\nappointed me Secretary-General of the Economic \r\nCommunity of Central African States (ECCAS). My \r\ntask will be to spearhead an institutional reform process \r\nin that important regional integration body. We are even \r\nmore determined to ensure economic integration in our \r\nsubregion because we believe that joint development \r\nis needed in order to deal with the f luctuations in the \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 23/26\r\ninternational market. Through its Office in Libreville, \r\nECCAS supports Central Africa in its efforts to deal \r\nwith the peace and security challenges in the region. \r\nIn that regard, member countries have confirmed their \r\nfirm determination to fight the beast of terrorism in all \r\nits forms regardless of its motivation.\r\nTo that end, the subregional counter-terrorism \r\nstrategy for Central Africa, which was recently \r\nendorsed in Yaoundé and is in line with the African \r\nUnion counter-terrorism strategy, translates our \r\ncommitment to eradicating that scourge through \r\nconcrete steps. I take this opportunity to commend the \r\nupcoming holding of a joint summit of ECCAS and \r\nthe Economic Community of West African States on \r\ncounter-terrorism, which I have always hoped to see \r\nhappen and which was encouraged by Security Council \r\nresolution 2349 (2017). I also commend the initiative \r\ntaken by the countries of the Group of Five for the Sahel \r\nto establish a subregional force to effectively combat \r\nterrorism and all other threats to peace and security.\r\nCombating terrorism is a multifaceted and long-\r\nterm struggle that requires cooperation among States \r\nand solidarity with the victims of such barbarism. The \r\nresponse cannot be exclusively military. I therefore call \r\nfor the implementation of the relevant provisions of \r\nresolution 2199 (2015) in order to reduce the sources of \r\nfinancing for these criminal networks.\r\nIn addition to terrorism, another serious threat \r\nto many countries, including mine, is poaching. In \r\nthat regard, my country has sponsored an important \r\nresolution aimed at pooling our efforts to contain \r\nthe problem, which decimates our f lora and fauna \r\nand encourages instability in a number of regions, \r\nparticularly in Africa. Speedy implementation of the \r\nrecommendations put forward in the resolution is \r\nessential and should guide us in seeking the proper \r\nbalance between the protection of nature and the \r\nsurvival of local populations, who are actually the main \r\nvictims of poaching.\r\nAmong the worrying current situations in \r\nAfrica, that in the Central African Republic requires \r\nour sustained attention. Gabon continues to have a \r\npresence in that brother country as part of the United \r\nNations Multidimensional Integrated Stabilization \r\nMission in the Central African Republic. I call on our \r\nvarious partners to support the action plan developed \r\nby ECCAS and the Central African Economic and \r\nMonetary Community, as well as the disarmament, \r\ndemobilization and reintegration programme.\r\nSimilarly, the arms embargo must be lifted for the \r\nlegal and legitimate Government of the Central African \r\nRepublic exclusively, so that it can restore security \r\nand its authority throughout the national territory. The \r\nresilience and defiance of the negative forces that are \r\nravaging the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the \r\nCentral African Republic and other parts of the Central \r\nAfrican subregion derive their strength from the illegal \r\nexploitation of underground natural resources and \r\nwildlife. International measures designed to combat \r\nthe illegal trade in such resources must be properly \r\nenforced if we wish to defeat the armed groups that \r\ncontinue to carry out such criminal activities.\r\nWorking to foster peace also requires eliminating \r\nweapons of mass destruction by implementing the \r\nrelevant international instruments. Some parts of the \r\nMiddle East have been the focus of the serious threats to \r\ninternational peace and security caused by the nebulous \r\nterrorist organization known as the Islamic State, which \r\nis exacerbating instability in Syria and Iraq.\r\nIn that connection, we must address the question \r\nof Palestine, which remains a thorn in the side of the \r\ninternational community. In my view, the resumption \r\nof direct talks between the two sides remains the only \r\nway to reach a solution. I commend the efforts by the \r\nUnited States and France to push for a resumption of \r\nthe peace process.\r\nSimilarly, we have noted the recent events on \r\nthe Korean peninsula and remain firmly committed \r\nto peace and stability in that part of the world. We \r\ncall for strict compliance with the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions in that regard.\r\nAnother major human tragedy unfolding before our \r\neyes is the situation of the Rohingya in Myanmar. In \r\nthe twenty-first century it is simply unacceptable that \r\nmen, women and children are being killed or forced \r\nto f lee their country for the mere fact that they belong \r\nto a particular religious community. The Assembly’s \r\nuniversal conscience cannot and must not accept that.\r\nFinally, and in connection with international \r\nsolidarity and justice, lifting the embargo that has \r\nplagued Cuba for several decades is only fair.\r\nOur Organization is blowing out its seventy-\r\nsecond candle. Its universal vocation has been firmly \r\nestablished. I am confident that, with our collective \r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n24/26 17-29579\r\ndetermination, it will be able to overcome the current \r\nmultifaceted challenges to peace and security in the \r\nworld. That is why prioritizing human beings by ensuring \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a protected planet is no \r\nlonger a simple ambition but a collective duty.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Gabonese Republic for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Ali Bongo Ondimba, President of the \r\nGabonese Republic, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Yemen.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Abdrabuh \r\nMansour Hadi Mansour, President of the Republic of \r\nYemen, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mansour (spoke in Arabic): On behalf \r\nof the Government and the people of Yemen, I sincerely \r\ncongratulate the President and his friendly nation, \r\nSlovakia, on assuming the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, and wish him \r\nevery success in his endeavours. I would also like to \r\nexpress my great appreciation for the significant efforts \r\nof his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, in guiding the \r\nwork of the previous session.\r\nI would like to thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nexceptional efforts in implementing the Organization’s \r\nnoble mission of maintaining international peace and \r\nsecurity, and in employing all its good offices with a \r\nview to achieving sustainable peace in my country, \r\nYemen. We are also grateful to his Special Envoy for \r\nYemen, Mr. Ismail Ould Cheikh Ahmed.\r\nThis debate is being held as we in the Republic of \r\nYemen are ending our third year of the war imposed \r\non our people by the Houthi/Saleh coalition, following \r\nits rebellion against the consensus solutions adopted \r\nunder the Gulf Cooperation Council Initiative and \r\nits Implementation Mechanism and the outcomes of \r\nthe national dialogue, as well as the political process \r\ncarried out fully under the auspices of the United \r\nNations. The political process culminated in a visit to \r\nSana’a by the former Secretary-General, where he held \r\na special meeting with the Security Council in Yemen. \r\nThe evil Houthi/Saleh coalition has rebelled against the \r\nnational consensus, which was based on the outcomes \r\nof the national dialogue and included all the Yemeni \r\npolitical parties and social factions. It has used violence \r\nand terrorism to rebel against the legitimately elected \r\nleadership and armed force against our people. It has \r\ndestroyed the cities of Yemen and taken the entire \r\ncountry hostage.\r\nAfter exhausting every possible peaceful political \r\nmeans to turn this evil coalition away from the path of \r\nviolence and terrorism that it has chosen, the Yemeni \r\npeople, in all their various factions, have united and \r\nresisted the rebels’ de facto policy of facilitating \r\nIranian expansionism in our region. To that end, we \r\nhave requested support, on behalf of the people of \r\nYemen, from our brothers in the Arab coalition under \r\nthe leadership of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. They \r\nhave responded to our request and granted us support.\r\nThe theme of the seventy-second session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly represents what we have been \r\nseeking in Yemen. Through negotiations in Geneva, \r\nVienna and Kuwait, our legitimate leadership has \r\nsought a sustainable, fair and lasting peace that will \r\nnot falter and that lays the foundation for a real State \r\nthat ensures peace and security for all its citizens and \r\nprevents violence. We seek a peace that grants the State \r\nalone a monopoly on the use of force and prevents \r\narmed militias from forming and operating in the \r\ncountry. It must be a peace that is based on consensual \r\ndocuments that people have agreed on and that have \r\nreceived international and regional support.\r\nHere, I would like to clarify a commonly heard \r\nclaim that our problem in Yemen is one of political \r\ndifferences that cannot be managed merely by sitting \r\naround negotiation tables, despite our efforts and \r\ncompromises in that regard. But what we are facing is \r\nnot even a coup d’état as it is commonly understood. \r\nIt transcends that and is based on a difference in \r\nphilosophies, ideologies and values. We are dealing \r\nwith extremist religious sects that believe that God \r\nhas granted them an ethnic superiority and the right to \r\nrule, to forge alliances with forces that seek retaliation \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.11\r\n17-29579 25/26\r\nand that go against all human values. In this way, the \r\ncoup of the Houthis, who are racist, backward and \r\npatrilineal, has gone beyond any traditional military \r\ncoups d’état, which still preserve the State and its \r\ninstitutions. These militias are destroying all State \r\ninstitutions. The army and security forces have been \r\nreplaced by popular committees and militias that serve \r\none faction only, based on ethnicity. That also affects \r\neconomic institutions.\r\nOur resources are utterly depleted, and we have \r\nnot even been able to pay salaries for almost a year. \r\nThe private sector has disappeared, replaced by a new \r\nclass of merchants who function at the expense of our \r\nnational interests. Even our school curricula have been \r\nreplaced with extremist curricula that have provoked \r\nsectarian strife. On top of all that, the opposition \r\nmilitias receive full support, politically and militarily, \r\nin kind, in the form of weapons and financing from \r\nIran, a State that is determined to destabilize our \r\nregion. Sustained peace can therefore only be possible \r\nif Iran ceases to interfere in our affairs, which it has \r\nbeen doing by creating tensions, inventing conflicts \r\nand stoking feelings of hatred and violence. We must \r\ncontrol Iran’s expansionist aspirations in the region.\r\nMember States may remember that when I stood \r\nbefore the Assembly five years ago, I spoke of the \r\nmeasures that we would take on the path of peaceful \r\npolitical transition in Yemen in the context of the \r\nGulf Cooperation Council Initiative and the National \r\nDialogue Conference outcomes (see A/67/PV.9), and \r\nI informed them that Iran had been taking various \r\nmeasures against us. We have seized shipments carrying \r\narms, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guards have been \r\nsupporting the militias in our country and supplying \r\nthem with long-range missiles. They remain a threat to \r\nour country and the entire world.\r\nI am trying to give Member States an image of the \r\nevents from the inside. The world needs to understand \r\nthat the rebels are refusing all calls for peace — from \r\nKuwait to Geneva — including the latest initiative about \r\nthe port of Al Hudaydah. We announced that we were \r\nready to accept the initiative on the Hudaydah seaport, \r\nbut the other side has unilaterally rejected it. They even \r\nattempted to assassinate an international envoy. They \r\nhave continued to threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity and international maritime sea lanes. They \r\nhave also threatened our brothers in the United Arab \r\nEmirates, attacking them with rockets.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I emphasize our continued \r\nwillingness to stop the war and build peace. We are not \r\nwarmongers. We desire peace. And I have personally \r\nextended my hand, and will continue to do so, to \r\nreach a sustainable peace, because we feel the weight \r\nof our responsibility for all citizens of the Yemeni \r\nState. I affirm that we continue to desire peace based \r\non the consensus agreements and everything that the \r\ninternational community has endorsed, including the \r\nimplementation of Security Council resolution 2216 \r\n(2015).\r\nI must not forget here to thank our brothers in the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, who have led the efforts to \r\nmitigate our humanitarian crisis through the support \r\nthat their country continues to provide through the \r\nKing Salman Centre for Humanitarian Aid and Relief, \r\nand to thank all of the humanitarian organizations of \r\nthe Arab coalition, donor countries and the United \r\nNations agencies, as well as all the international efforts \r\nto combat the cholera outbreak. We stress that we are \r\nstill in need of support and assistance, given our high \r\nlevels of poverty, insecurity and food insecurity. We \r\nare still under blockade and at war. The city of Taiz has \r\nbeen under siege for three years.\r\nThe situation is dire in all of the governorates \r\nunder rebel control. Salaries are no longer being paid. \r\nThe State’s resources, including customs incomes, have \r\nbeen looted. We therefore call on the United Nations \r\nand the international community to shoulder their \r\nresponsibilities in Yemen by applying pressure on \r\nthe rebels to implement the relevant Security Council \r\nresolutions and offer real compromises, so that we \r\ncan avoid more bloodshed and destruction and so that \r\nhumanitarian assistance can reach the people who \r\nneed it.\r\nFrom this rostrum, I announce that we in the Yemeni \r\nGovernment are ready to provide all of the facilitation \r\nneeded so that humanitarian assistance can have access \r\neverywhere in Yemen, from Sana’a to Al-Mahra, as well \r\nas in the areas under Houthi control. We are responsible \r\nbefore God first and before our people and the world \r\nas well. We are responsible for all our Yemeni people, \r\nregardless of their loyalties. We want to preserve the \r\nlife of every Yemeni, including those who fire bullets \r\nat us and target the Yemeni people. As a legitimately \r\nelected leader, it is my job to save the Yemeni people \r\nfrom further bloodshed. It is forbidden for a Yemeni to \r\nkill another — absolutely forbidden.\r\nA/72/PV.11 21/09/2017\r\n26/26 17-29579\r\nThe Yemeni Government continues to face the \r\neconomic and security challenges that stem from the \r\ndestruction of all aspects of Yemeni life. Today, the \r\nYemeni Government needs extensive support for its \r\nefforts to consolidate peace and stability, provide \r\nservices in the liberated areas, control the economic \r\nsituation and implement counter-terrorism measures.\r\nWe call on friendly donor countries and \r\ninternational organizations to provide urgent support to \r\nYemen and uphold the pledges made at the conference \r\nheld in Geneva in April in support of the humanitarian \r\nresponse plan for Yemen. One year has passed, and only \r\n50 per cent of the pledged funding has been provided. \r\nWe also want to reactivate the dormant Group of \r\nFriends of Yemen. We must save Yemen from the crisis \r\nand move from humanitarian relief to reconstruction \r\nand economic recovery.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen sincerely and effectively \r\nsupports counter-terrorism efforts, particularly because \r\nmy country has long suffered from terrorism. We \r\nreject all forms of terrorism and continue to embrace \r\nour tolerant Islamic values, which reject violence and \r\nextremism, while calling for tolerance and brotherly \r\nrelations. We reach out to the international community \r\nto coordinate efforts in the areas of security, culture \r\nand information and technology, so that we can defeat \r\nterrorism together.\r\nIsrael’s occupation of the Palestinian territories and \r\nits settlement policies still represent one of the greatest \r\ncauses of stress in our region. The people of our region \r\ntherefore look to the Assembly to find a fair and lasting \r\nsolution so that the Palestinian people can establish \r\ntheir own State, with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nand end the occupation and settlement, as well as the \r\nsuffering of the Palestinian people.\r\nThe Republic of Yemen denounces the plight of the \r\nRohingya Muslims in Myanmar. That genocide must \r\ncease. Terrorism in the State must stop, and we call on the \r\ninternational community to uphold its responsibilities \r\nand prevent such monstrous events, which we thought \r\nour modern world had permanently eliminated.\r\nTogether with our patient people and all the \r\nhonourable citizens of the world, we will spare no effort \r\nto rid the Yemeni people of the atrocities committed \r\nby the rebels. We will, with God’s help, fulfil the \r\naspirations of our people to build a federal civil State \r\nthat upholds justice and equality and good governance. \r\nWe will rebuild a new Yemen that embraces all of its \r\nchildren — a Yemen that is a source of stability and \r\nsecurity for itself, its neighbours and the world.\r\nI should not conclude without expressing my \r\nsincere congratulations to all Yemeni people and \r\nfreedom-loving nations on the occasion of the fifty-\r\nfifth anniversary of our revolution, on 26 September, \r\nwhich we will commemorate in the next few days. That \r\nrevolution uprooted one of the most despotic regimes in \r\nhistor, that of Imam Ahmed in northern Yemen, whom \r\nliberators toppled to found our Republic in 1963.\r\nWe are reminded of that racist regime by the Houthis \r\nand their allies. Over the past three years, they have \r\ntried to impose a similarly racist regime once again, in \r\nan even more violent and terroristic manner. During the \r\ntime that our capital of Sana’a has been under Houthi \r\ncontrol, thousands have been killed, injured or detained. \r\nThe media have been outlawed and journalists arrested, \r\nalong with countless other retaliatory measures. We \r\nmust control that racist group. I salute our people on \r\nthe occasion of the revolution’s anniversary.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish the General Assembly every \r\nsuccess at its seventy-second session and hope that it \r\ncan achieve more development and effectiveness in its \r\nwork. And I wish all Member States and human society \r\nprosperity, peace and stability.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Yemen for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour, President \r\nof the Republic of Yemen, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe meeting rose at 12.10 p.m.\r\n"
