"United Nations A/72/PV.12\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n12th plenary meeting\r\nThursday, 21 September 2017, 12.10 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Rabary-Njaka \r\n(Madagascar), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 12.10 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Danny Faure, President of the \r\nRepublic of Seychelles\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Seychelles.\r\nMr. Danny Faure, President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Danny Faure, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Seychelles, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Faure: I would like to join those who \r\nhave spoken before me in congratulating His Excellency \r\nMr Miroslav Lajčák on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I \r\nwould also like to thank His Excellency Ambassador \r\nPeter Thomson for making the small island developing \r\nStates and the rest of the international community \r\nproud through his strong leadership of the seventy-\r\nfirst session.\r\nMay I start by saying that the thoughts of the \r\nGovernment and the people of Seychelles go out to the \r\nmillions of people in South Asia, Africa, the United \r\nStates and Mexico, as well as our island brothers \r\nand sisters in the Caribbean, who have suffered \r\nunimaginable losses from floods, hurricanes and \r\nother forms of extreme weather these past months.We \r\nurge the international community to not only respond \r\ngenerously to those countries’ calls for support, but also \r\nto take the need to upscale the urgent action required \r\nfar more seriously in order to prevent, prepare for, \r\nadapt to and recover from such increasingly destructive \r\nclimate-related disasters.\r\nEvents around the world today sadly show that \r\nthe theme of this year’s general debate, “Focusing \r\non people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet”, cannot be achieved without \r\neffective implementation of the principles of democracy \r\nand a concerted demonstration of will. That calls for \r\ngood governance, transparency and accountability, \r\nwhich serve as the foundation for the prosperity and \r\nsecurity of all nations. Indeed, they put the rights and \r\naspirations of the people at the centre of development, \r\nwhere prosperity is shared by all. We must create the \r\nnecessary space in society for diverging views and ideas \r\nto f lourish and be respected. Doing so helps promote \r\nunity, tolerance and respect in the population.\r\nSeychelles is, for the first time in its history, \r\nexperiencing a system of political cohabitation where I, \r\nas President and head of the executive arm, am working \r\nwith a legislature dominated by the opposition. When I \r\nfirst addressed our legislature at the National Assembly \r\nalmost a year ago last October, I gave my word that we \r\nwould work together to deliver a better future for our \r\npeople. Our cohabitation is working well.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Most importantly, \r\nit is an environment based on mutual respect. We are \r\nreshaping our Government to make it more inclusive. \r\nWe are empowering our citizens, especially our youth, \r\nby giving them equal opportunities to play important \r\nroles in the development of our country and the growth \r\nof our economy. In that context, we are improving \r\nthe environment for free media to play a vital role in \r\nnation-building efforts.\r\nTogether with the National Assembly we are \r\namending legislation relating to institutions, authorities \r\nand agencies so as to ensure that they reflect the \r\nnew principles of good governance. With greater \r\ntransparency, good governance and accountability, \r\nthe independence of institutions and authorities will \r\ncontinue to increase. They are the bedrock of our society.\r\nWe are writing a new chapter in Seychelles, where \r\nwe work together to overcome our challenges and show \r\nrespect for all opinions in the interest of a Seychelles \r\nthat unites all of us despite our differences. Openness \r\nand a policy of discourse are at the core of my nation’s \r\nwillingness to secure a bold future for our people. I \r\nbelieve that small island developing States such as mine \r\ncan serve as the moral barometers for what is right. \r\nWe do not shy from accepting and learning from the \r\nexperiences of others but, in that regard, we also have \r\nvaluable lessons to share with others. The path that we \r\nare charting in our country can serve as an example to \r\nall for the sake of tolerance and a global lasting peace.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThat has been our experience in Seychelles. But as \r\nwe look around us, what do we see? We see growing \r\ninstability on a national and regional scale. That is a \r\nhindrance to peace and to a decent and sustainable life \r\nfor all of our peoples. We believe that such factors lie at \r\nthe heart of the global refugee crisis. That is a problem \r\nthat could worsen owing to the increasing movements \r\nof populations as a result of climate change.\r\nA globalized world economy requires us to act \r\nas organized regions in order to give ourselves the \r\nbest possible chance of transforming our hopes into \r\ntangible improvements in the quality of life for our \r\npeoples by strengthening the values of democracy and \r\ngood governance.\r\nThat also applies to this institution — the United \r\nNations. Indeed, after a quarter of a century of reforms \r\nand counter-reforms of the Security Council, it is high \r\ntime to harken to the deafening call of more than 160 \r\nStates Members of the United Nations for true and just \r\nreforms. That would be a way for us to react to the \r\naccusations that the United Nations is simply a room \r\nin which to hold rambling discussions. We would also \r\nhave an opportunity to practice what we preach.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFor there to be peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet, it is not enough just to \r\nthrow more resources — financial, human and \r\nothers — into implementing the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. All \r\nof those processes should be democratically governed, \r\nunderpinned by transparency and accountability \r\nthroughout and in harmony with and with respect for \r\nthe natural environment in which we live.\r\nIn Seychelles, the private sector, civil society, \r\nnon-governmental organizations and parliamentarians \r\nhave joined with the public sector in a national effort \r\nto integrate the 2030 Agenda and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals into our country’s budget and \r\ndevelopment plans. Together we are drafting a new \r\nnational development strategy and a more sustainable \r\nnational development plan for Seychelles over the \r\nnext 15 years called Vision 2032. That exercise also \r\nincludes the integration of Agenda 2063, adopted by the \r\nAfrican Union, and the Small Island Developing States \r\nAccelerated Modalities of Action.\r\nThe same inclusive approach applies to stepping up \r\nour implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange in the light of recent developments. According \r\nto the latest science, all stakeholders need to be involved \r\nif the international community is to drastically upscale \r\nour collective climate action so as to achieve our targets. \r\nThere is something that I said at the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Marrakech in November 2016 \r\nthat is even more pertinent today, as we head towards \r\nthe next Conference of the Parties, led by our fellow \r\nsmall island developing State of Fiji and supported \r\nby Germany. Referring to the Paris Agreement, I said,\r\n“For the very first time in history, a global \r\nclimate-change deal, giving renewed hope to the \r\nworld, has been reached. We find ourselves at \r\na crossroads and cannot afford to renege on our \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 3/33\r\ncollective commitment to travel the moral path for \r\nthe sake of humanity.”\r\nFrom small islands come big ideas. Last year \r\nSeychelles reached an agreement with the Paris Club \r\nand others on a first-of-its-kind $21 million debt-\r\nfor-adaptation swap to protect 30 per cent of our \r\n1.37-million-square-kilometre exclusive economic \r\nzone, partly as an ecosystem-based adaptation to climate \r\nchange. Also, by the end of this year, we aim to launch \r\nthe world’s first blue bonds to raise another $15 million \r\nfor sustainable fishing practices in our waters. Both of \r\nthose measures seek to establish innovative sources of \r\nfinancing to implement Sustainable Development Goal \r\n14, on oceans and seas, and other interlinked SDGs \r\nas part of developing the Seychelles’ blue economy. \r\nWe thank our many partners at home and abroad who \r\nhave helped us on this bold and exciting new path to \r\nsustainable development and resilience to climate \r\nchange and who continue to be actively involved.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to congratulate Fiji and \r\nSweden for the great success of the Ocean Conference \r\nin June and its Call for Action. As President of a \r\nlarge-ocean developing State, I would like to reiterate \r\nSeychelles’ commitment to continuing to play a \r\npioneering role in the search for innovative ways to \r\nrespond to the Call for Action and implement SDG 14 \r\nas an integral part of all the SDGs and the 2030 Agenda.\r\nOn that positive note, I wish all the peoples of the \r\nworld a happy International Peace Day.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of \r\nSeychelles for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Dany Faure, President of the Republic \r\nof Seychelles, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Botswana\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Botswana.\r\nMr. Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Botswana, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Botswana, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Masisi (Botswana): I feel deeply honoured \r\nand privileged to deliver this statement on behalf of the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Botswana, His Excellency \r\nLieutenant General Seretse Khama Ian Khama.\r\nOn behalf of my delegation, I wish to join previous \r\nspeakers in congratulating you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession. I assure you of the full support and cooperation \r\nof my delegation in the discharge of your mandate. In \r\nthe same vein, please allow me to pay tribute to your \r\npredecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, for his \r\nstewardship of the Assembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nI would also take this opportunity to extend a warm \r\nwelcome to our new Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. António Guterres, and his Deputy and wish them an \r\nenjoyable and successful tenure at the helm of our world \r\nbody. We also thank our former Secretary-General, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his leadership and the \r\nvaluable contribution he made towards advancing the \r\nmandate of the Organization over the past decade.\r\nWe are gathered here at the United Nations \r\nbecause we share a common destiny. Despite its \r\nimperfections, the United Nations remains the only \r\nuniversal organization that has the moral authority and \r\nlegitimacy to seek global solutions to the challenges we \r\nface. Botswana is of the firm conviction that as Member \r\nStates, we collectively hold the will and the power to \r\nchange the world for the better and for the benefit of \r\nboth present and future generations.\r\nBotswana welcomes the theme of this session, \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”. We strongly feel that \r\nthat theme is pertinent because it reinforces the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which the global \r\ncommunity adopted on 25 September 2015 as a “plan \r\nof action for people, planet and prosperity” or a charter \r\nfor “people, planet, prosperity, peace and partnership” \r\nin the twenty-first century (resolution 70/1). That \r\ntheme appropriately draws our attention to four of the \r\nfive Ps of the 2030 Agenda: people, planet, prosperity, \r\npeace and partnership. It recognizes the importance of \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n4/33 17-29585\r\nfocusing on people and improving their lives, as they \r\nare both the main beneficiaries of development and \r\nits greatest resource, as we work to achieve peace and \r\ndevelopment on a sustainable and resilient basis. The \r\ntheme thus recognizes the nexus between peace and \r\nsecurity, sustainable development and climate change.\r\nIn that regard, the 2030 Agenda notes that there can \r\nbe no sustainable development without peace and no \r\npeace without sustainable development. It is therefore \r\nimperative that we give priority to the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda and the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange in order to achieve sustainable development \r\nand address climate change.\r\nWith regard to people, I am pleased to state that \r\nthe Government of Botswana embarked on a series \r\nof multi-stakeholder consultations involving both \r\nthe public and the private sectors, civil society, local \r\nauthorities, development partners and academia in \r\nthe formulation of our National Development Plan 11, \r\nwhich runs from 2017 to 2023, and in the formulation \r\nof our current Vision 2036, which runs from 2017 to \r\n2036. The Plan and the Vision are both aligned to the \r\n2030 Agenda and the African Union Agenda 2063. We \r\npurposefully undertook extensive consultations so as to \r\nensure that our national priorities reflect our people’s \r\nneeds and aspirations. We hold the view that our people \r\nhave a right to sustainable development and improved \r\nquality of life. We must, therefore, pursue those twin \r\nobjectives as a moral and political imperative.\r\nIt is important to recall that when we adopted \r\nAgenda 2030 two years ago, we acknowledged that \r\nevery goal, every target and every indicator in the \r\nAgenda represents a step towards a better world. We \r\nrecognized the need for each country, based on its \r\nneeds and circumstances, to formulate a unique set \r\nof actions to achieve the universal goals that we set \r\nfor ourselves. We also recognized that innovation, \r\nscience and technology will be critical catalysts in the \r\nsuccessful implementation of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nIn line with the theme of the seventy-second \r\nsession, our two national development frameworks \r\nplace heavy emphasis on improving the quality of life \r\nof all people in Botswana through the acceleration of \r\nsocioeconomic development and the provision of better \r\neducation, health care and housing, and by tackling \r\nextreme poverty, income inequality, gender inequality \r\nand unemployment, especially among young people \r\nand women. Driven by our strong desire to build an \r\ninclusive, peaceful and prosperous society based on \r\nthe respect for democracy, human rights and the rule \r\nof law, we accordingly adjusted our empowerment \r\nprogrammes in order to ensure that they cater to all \r\nvulnerable and disadvantaged groups in our society, \r\nincluding women and girls, young people, the elderly, \r\npeople with disabilities, and children.\r\nTo that end, the top priorities of our National \r\nDevelopment Plan 11 are human-capital development, \r\nsocial development, the development of diversified \r\nsources of economic growth, the sustainable use \r\nof natural resources, the consolidation of good \r\ngovernance, the strengthening of national security \r\nand the implementation of an effective monitoring and \r\nevaluation system.\r\nIn order to ensure that all our people live in \r\ndignity, the Government of Botswana took a bold \r\npolicy decision to shift from poverty reduction to the \r\neradication of extreme poverty, which resulted in a \r\nmarked reduction in the proportion of the population \r\nliving in abject poverty or below $1.25 per day, from \r\n24.5 per cent in 2002-2003 to 6.4 per cent in 2009-2010. \r\nThat is a notable achievement considering the fact that \r\nin 1985-1986, 59 per cent of the population was living \r\nin poverty.\r\nWe identified the sustainable use of natural \r\nresources as one of the main priorities of our national \r\ndevelopment agenda so as to ensure that the natural \r\nwealth of our country benefits both present and \r\nfuture generations. To address youth unemployment, \r\nthe Government introduced youth-empowerment \r\nprogrammes, such as the Youth Development Fund, \r\nthe National Service Programme and the Internship \r\nProgramme. For the past two decades, more than 25 per \r\ncent of the Government’s total annual budget has been \r\ninvested in education and skills development.\r\nIn addition, we have implemented a number \r\nof f lagship programmes, the centrepiece of which \r\nis the Economic Stimulus Programme, which was \r\nintroduced to stimulate the economy and address the \r\ninfrastructure deficit. We are also proud that Botswana \r\nwas among the countries that shared their 2030 Agenda \r\nimplementation experience under the auspices of the \r\nrecently held High-level Political Forum and Voluntary \r\nNational Review exercises.\r\nOn climate change, Botswana fully supports the \r\nobservation made in the 2030 Agenda that\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 5/33\r\n“[c]limate change is one of the greatest challenges \r\nof our time and its adverse impacts undermine \r\nthe ability of all countries to achieve sustainable \r\ndevelopment” (resolution 70/1, para. 140).\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the entry into force of the \r\n2015 Paris Agreement on Climate Change and reaffirm \r\nour commitment to that agreement. Botswana is pleased \r\nto be among the countries that signed and ratified the \r\nAgreement before the threshold for ratifications for its \r\nentry into force was reached. We appeal to all countries \r\nto remain steadfast in their defence and protection of \r\nthe integrity of the Paris Agreement.\r\nWe reiterate our appeal to the Government of the \r\nUnited States of America to reconsider its decision to \r\nwithdraw from that landmark agreement, which marks \r\na universal effort by the international community \r\nto tackle the challenges of climate change. As those \r\npresent are aware, the challenge of climate change \r\nrequires collective action, as no single country can \r\nsuccessfully address the challenge on its own. It is as if \r\nthe recent hurricanes and their disastrous effects were \r\nmeant to underscore to the American Administration \r\nthat climate change is real. If there is anything positive \r\nthat we have learned from those hurricanes, it is that it \r\nhas been able to bring people in the affected states and \r\nwider America together — be they young or old, black, \r\nHispanic or white or of whatever religious persuasion.\r\nWe also welcome the recent convening by the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly of the first ever \r\nOcean Conference in New York, pursuant to Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14. Even though Botswana is a \r\nlandlocked country, we are impacted in one way or \r\nthe other by the ocean environment. We also have a \r\nstrategic interest in benefiting from marine resources. \r\nIt is for that reason that we actively participated in the \r\nnegotiations that led to the adoption of the Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea of 1982, to which we subsequently \r\nbecame a State party.\r\nI am delighted to announce that Botswana has \r\nresponded positively to international humanitarian \r\nappeals, which have been made from time to time \r\nin response to humanitarian calamities that have \r\naff licted a number of countries, including the \r\nextremely devastating famine in Somalia. Consistent \r\nwith our caring and compassionate nature, we will \r\ncontinue to do everything we can, within the limit of \r\nour meagre resources, to extend assistance to fellow \r\nmembers of the human family who are in dire need of \r\nhumanitarian relief.\r\nOn international peace and security, the Charter \r\nof the United Nations states that the Organization \r\nwas created “to save succeeding generations from the \r\nscourge of war”, and yet peace continues to elude us, \r\nespecially in some parts of Africa, as well as in other \r\nparts of the world. There are continuing reports of \r\nraging conflicts, gross human rights violations, extra-\r\njudicial killings, sexual violence and arbitrary arrests \r\nand detentions.\r\nThe situation in South Sudan, in particular, \r\ncontinues to be a cause for grave concern. The country \r\nis virtually on a precipice. The people of that country \r\nhave yet to enjoy the peace that the Agreement on the \r\nResolution of the Conflict in the Republic of South \r\nSudan of August 2015 was widely expected to deliver. \r\nWe therefore appeal to the Intergovernmental Authority \r\non Development countries, as the main guarantors of \r\nthe Agreement, to constructively engage the leaders \r\nand political stakeholders in South Sudan, with a view \r\nto getting them to unconditionally commit to the full \r\nand effective implementation of the Agreement.\r\nOn Syria, the political, security and humanitarian \r\nsituation there remains catastrophic. Botswana is on \r\nrecord as having consistently expressed disappointment \r\nat the Security Council’s failure to take decisive action \r\non the situation in Syria. That failure is due to the fact \r\nthat some permanent members of the Council have, \r\nfrom time to time, vetoed resolutions that were aimed \r\nat addressing the political and humanitarian crisis in \r\nthe country.\r\nIn view of that unfortunate scenario, Botswana \r\nbelieves that the international community should \r\nalways resort to using the moral power and authority \r\nof the General Assembly whenever there is paralysis in \r\nthe Security Council. We also fully support the referral \r\nof the situation in Syria to the International Criminal \r\nCourt, in order for those responsible for committing \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity to be held \r\naccountable for their actions.\r\nBotswana is deeply concerned about the unrelenting \r\nand blatant contravention of international law and \r\nUnited Nations resolutions by North Korea through its \r\ncontinued testing of ballistic missiles. Those despicable \r\nacts by North Korea pose a threat, not only to the \r\nKorean peninsula, but throughout the Pacific region \r\nand the world at large. It is obvious to us, as it should \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n6/33 17-29585\r\nbe to everyone else, that North Korea is being assisted \r\nby others in its development of missiles and nuclear \r\ntechnology. They are, therefore, as much to blame for \r\nthose missile and nuclear tests as North Korea itself is.\r\nWe therefore appeal to the international community \r\nto work in unison and take prompt and decisive action \r\nthat will force North Korea to adhere to the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations Charter. Inaction \r\nis not an option in the face of such adversity. Regime \r\nchange must be brought about in order to remove, once \r\nand for all, the everlasting threat to peace in that region \r\nand give the North Korean people hope for a life of \r\nfreedom and prosperity.\r\nOn Western Sahara, it is reprehensible that \r\nthat territory remains the only non-self-governing \r\nterritory on the African continent. We therefore \r\nreiterate our support for and solidarity with the \r\npeople of Western Sahara in the pursuit of their \r\njust and inalienable right to self-determination. \r\nWe strongly feel that it is high time that they be \r\nallowed to exercise that right through an independent \r\nand impartial vote under the supervision of the United \r\nNations. The Sahrawi have waited long enough for \r\nthat to happen. We similarly support the people of \r\nPalestine in their legitimate struggle for sovereignty \r\nand independent statehood. As a gesture of our support \r\nand solidarity, I am pleased to report that Botswana \r\nestablished diplomatic relations with the State of \r\nPalestine on 8 March.\r\nBotswana strongly condemns terrorism, violent \r\nextremism and racial intolerance in all their forms and \r\nmanifestations. In that regard, it is deeply regrettable \r\nthat we have recently witnessed a spate of terrorist \r\nattacks on innocent people and Governments around \r\nthe world. I wish to state that we stand firmly in \r\nsolidarity with the Governments and the peoples of the \r\ncountries concerned and extend our deepest sympathy \r\nto them. We need to be constantly mindful of the fact \r\nthat no single country is immune to terrorist attacks. \r\nThose attacks are a stark reminder of the ferocious \r\nnature of terrorism. The international community must, \r\ntherefore, urgently take concerted action to resolutely \r\nfight that scourge.\r\nBotswana fully supports the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts towards nuclear disarmament. \r\nWe also reaffirm our commitment to international \r\ninstruments that ban weapons of mass destruction, \r\nsuch as the Convention on the Prohibition of the \r\nDevelopment, Production, Stockpiling and Use of \r\nChemical Weapons and the Biological Weapons \r\nConvention. In that regard, we welcome the recent \r\nadoption by the General Assembly of a legally binding \r\ntreaty to prohibit the production of nuclear weapons. \r\nWe are fully convinced that only a nuclear-free world \r\nwill guarantee a safer future for our populations.\r\nBotswana greatly values the opportunity it was \r\ngiven to contribute to the promotion and protection of \r\nhuman rights through its membership in the Human \r\nRights Council for two consecutive terms. With the \r\nimminent end of our tenure in the Council in December, I \r\nwish to reaffirm that we will continue to work earnestly \r\nwith the international community to advance the global \r\nhuman rights agenda and so that all the people of the \r\nworld can live in democracies where human rights and \r\nthe rule of law are upheld. Our advocacy on human \r\nrights is premised on the firm belief that society’s \r\naspirations for sustainable development will remain \r\na mirage unless we redouble our collective efforts \r\ntowards equality and human dignity.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to urge everyone to \r\nmaintain the momentum on the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Let us \r\nsummon our collective wisdom and strength, coupled \r\nwith our singularity of purpose, to deliver real change \r\nfor the benefit of the peoples we represent. Botswana \r\npledges to be an active and reliable partner in the \r\ncommon endeavour to create a better and safer world \r\nof shared prosperity, where no people, no region and no \r\ncountry will feel left behind. That is the best legacy we \r\ncan collectively bequeath to posterity.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nBotswana for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Mokgweetsi Eric Masisi, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Botswana, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Excellency Mr. Andrej \r\nPlenković, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Croatia\r\nMr. Andrey Plenković, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Croatia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Andrey Plenković, Prime Minister \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 7/33\r\nof the Republic of Croatia, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Plenković (Croatia) (spoke in English): Let me \r\ntake this opportunity to offer my sincere condolences \r\nto all those affected by the destruction wrought by \r\nHurricanes Irma and Maria and to the people of Mexico, \r\nwho have been hit by successive earthquakes in past \r\nfew days.\r\nTwenty-five years ago, my country’s first President, \r\nFranjo Tuđman, addressed the General Assembly as \r\nCroatia was being admitted to the United Nations (see \r\nA/47/PV.7), which brought us back into the fold of free \r\nnations. At that time, he appealed to the international \r\ncommunity to help end the aggression against Croatia \r\nand establish lasting peace. Since then, my country has \r\nbeen rebuilt, modernized and profoundly transformed \r\nand has become one of Europe’s top tourist destinations. \r\nToday Croatia is a State member of the European \r\nUnion and NATO. Building on its unique historical \r\ncircumstances, we are now actively participating \r\nin peacekeeping operations around the globe and \r\nproviding development aid to societies in need.\r\nI address the Assembly as the Prime Minister of \r\na country that in that relatively short time has served \r\non the Security Council, presided over the Economic \r\nand Social Council and chaired the Peacebuilding \r\nCommission, and which is currently a member of the \r\nHuman Rights Council.\r\nToday we celebrate the International Day of Peace. I \r\nwould like to reiterate that, as a peace-loving nation — as \r\nsymbolized here at the United Nations by the recently \r\nrestored Peace Monument by our great sculptor, \r\nAntun Augustinčić — Croatia is a strong advocate of \r\na rules-based international order. At the national and \r\nglobal levels, we believe that institutions need to be \r\nmore open to the public and genuinely involve people \r\nin their decision-making. It is only through an active \r\nand informed citizenry that we can make Governments \r\naccountable and create credible institutions.\r\nOnly well-functioning institutions ensure the \r\nimplementation of the rule of law. Such citizen \r\ninvolvement brings about a welcome mix of \r\nrepresentative and participatory democracy by \r\nbringing forward substantiated arguments and avoiding \r\nsuperficial and misleading populism. Croatia places \r\ngreat emphasis on peace, justice and strong institutions \r\nas one of the 17 goals to transform our world.\r\nOur own experiences in building State institutions \r\nwere a particular challenge for a country that achieved \r\npeace and re-established its territorial integrity only \r\n20 years ago. Croatia is dedicated to assisting others \r\nin post-conflict transitions with its own experiences in \r\nreconciliation and confidence-building.\r\nWe were a recipient of international security \r\nassistance, including through several United Nations \r\nmissions. One of the most successful peacekeeping \r\nmissions to date was the United Nations Transitional \r\nAdministration in Eastern Slavonia, Baranja and \r\nWestern Sirmium, which ended in January 1998 with \r\nthe peaceful reintegration of our formerly occupied \r\nterritories. We put at the world’s disposal that unique \r\nknow-how and extensive expertise as a useful \r\ncomplementary contribution to the international \r\ncommunity’s efforts in similar situations, such as \r\nwith the implementation of the Minsk agreements in \r\nUkraine, where we can draw many parallels.\r\nDiscussing strong international organizations \r\nglobally also means addressing the strength of this \r\ninstitution — the United Nations. As the world \r\nchanges, our firm belief is that the United Nations \r\nmust also keep up and change. Croatia supports the \r\nSecretary-General’s drive to reform the Secretariat, \r\nespecially in peacekeeping and development. The \r\nSecretary-General’s surge in diplomacy is also a much-\r\nneeded development.\r\nSecurity Council reform is central to United Nations \r\nreform. It is vital that its membership — both permanent \r\nand non-permanent — be regionally balanced and more \r\nreflective of the world 70 years into the Organization’s \r\nlife. In particular, we believe that the path to achieving \r\nthat goal would be expedited by enlarging both categories \r\nof membership, including by ensuring that the Group \r\nof Eastern European States is better represented in the \r\nSecurity Council’s non-permanent membership.\r\nOne of the effects of globalization is that the world \r\nis faced with an unprecedented number of people on \r\nthe move. Refugee crises and mass migration are a \r\nreality. One in 30 people around the world is a migrant. \r\nCroatia has faced acute refugee and migrant crises in \r\nthe past. The approach we took — and will always \r\ntake — was one that put people first. In the context \r\nof the upcoming negotiations on the global compact on \r\nmigration, we advocate an approach to human mobility \r\nthat prioritizes the safety, dignity and the human rights \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n8/33 17-29585\r\nand fundamental freedoms of all migrants, no matter \r\nwhere they come from or where they are headed.\r\nAs with all global challenges, a holistic approach \r\nis required in that regard. We therefore need to work \r\ntogether to fight the root causes of mass migrations — be \r\nit poverty, failing States and wars or climate change and \r\nnatural disasters — while standing against exploitation \r\nand abuse in the context of human trafficking and \r\npeople smuggling. In the framework of the European \r\nUnion, Croatia is working with its partners on \r\nstemming the illegal f lows of people, especially from \r\nthe Eastern Mediterranean-Balkan route, while at the \r\nsame time providing concrete support to countries of \r\norigin to address root causes, in particular through its \r\ndevelopment aid programmes.\r\nIn addressing crises across the globe, our focus \r\nshould be on early warning, prevention and diplomacy. \r\nAny post-conflict measure comes too late, especially in \r\nterms of human life. Conflicts need to be dealt with on a \r\ncase-by-case basis and require tailor-made approaches. \r\nWhile a consistent approach to conflicts by the United \r\nNations, and in particular by the Security Council, \r\nis essential for the Organization’s credibility, copy-\r\npasted, one-size-fits-all approaches are not the most \r\neffective way to proceed.\r\nIn understanding the situation and risks on the \r\nground, we must in particular draw on the knowledge and \r\nexperience of local populations, neighbouring countries \r\nand regional organizations. Croatia believes that when \r\naddressing conflicts and crises — be it in Syria, Libya, \r\nIraq, Yemen or anywhere else in the world — it is \r\nimportant to have a global, comprehensive approach \r\nbased on solidarity and coordinated international \r\neffort under strong United Nations leadership. Such \r\nan approach would include political, humanitarian, \r\nsocioeconomic, stabilization and security elements, \r\nand in which reconstruction goes hand in hand with \r\nreconciliation and building resilience.\r\nOur contribution to peacekeeping operations will \r\ncontinue to be an important component of our foreign \r\npolicy, both through direct participation and sharing \r\nour experiences and expertise or know-how. Croatia \r\nhas contributed to 19 United Nations peacekeeping \r\noperations to date, and we are currently preparing \r\nour contribution to United Nations Interim Force in \r\nLebanon. Like many other countries, apart from United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations, we also participate in \r\ninternational operations led by other organizations, such \r\nas the European Union, NATO and the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe.\r\nHuman rights and fundamental freedoms are \r\nuniversal values. We should spare no effort in their \r\npromotion and protection. Any violation of human \r\nrights requires an immediate and appropriate response. \r\nWe advocate tighter links between the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and the Security Council. We also acknowledge \r\nthe importance of the principle of the responsibility to \r\nprotect. We take particular pride in the fact that one of \r\nCroatia’s top diplomats leads the United Nations efforts \r\nin that regard.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the United \r\nNations Office of Counter-Terrorism, as it is evident \r\nthat there is a real need for strategic coordination and \r\nleadership for our global counter-terrorism efforts. It is \r\nalso necessary that we continue working on preventing \r\nand countering radicalization and violent extremism.\r\nCroatia fully supports the recent unanimous \r\nSecurity Council action on North Korea, whose actions \r\nrepresent a direct threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity. We appeal to the North Korean authorities to \r\ndiscontinue developing and testing nuclear weapons and \r\nto fully meet their commitments under international \r\nlaw, the relevant to the Security Council resolutions \r\nand the global non-proliferation regime.\r\nAdherence to the standards, principles and rules \r\nof international law and their faithful implementation \r\nprovide a firm foundation for lasting peace and stability \r\nworldwide, to which we are deeply attached. In that \r\nregard, I would particularly like to recall the principles \r\nof good faith and free consent. We believe that disputes \r\nshould be resolved through peaceful means and in \r\nconformity with international law.\r\nIt is of the utmost importance that all international \r\nadjudications meet the highest legal standards and \r\nfully respect their own relevant rules. Compromising \r\nthe impartiality or independence of international \r\nadjudicators or tribunals, as was the case in the \r\nterminated arbitration process between Croatia and \r\nSlovenia, makes their decisions legally void — and left \r\nCroatia with no choice other than to withdraw from the \r\narbitration process.\r\nWe consider that that example of undermining the \r\nrule of law is a discouragement for States considering \r\nthird-party dispute settlement. At the same time, \r\nwe want to solve the open border issue with our \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 9/33\r\nneighbouring friend and ally Slovenia through bilateral \r\ndialogue. In addition, Croatia strongly supports the full \r\nand unequivocal implementation of all applicable rules \r\nof international humanitarian and criminal law, as well \r\nas the full investigation and punishment of all atrocities.\r\nPreserving peace and stability in South-East \r\nEurope is obviously of key importance for my country. \r\nWhile the world faces many overwhelming challenges, \r\nwe should bear in mind that regional stability in South-\r\nEast Europe is still to be entrenched. By transferring \r\nour knowledge and promoting the integration of the \r\ncountries of South-East Europe into the European \r\nUnion and NATO — if they so wish — Croatia actively \r\nencourages stability in the region.\r\nWe believe in building strong societies in our \r\nneighbourhood, while aiming to shift away from \r\ncontaining crises towards prevention, political dialogue \r\nand active engagement. That is especially important \r\nin neighbouring Bosnia and Herzegovina, where the \r\nproper implementation of the constitutional equality \r\nof its three constituent peoples — Bosniaks, Serbs \r\nand Croats — is a prerequisite for ensuring the full \r\nfunctionality and stability of the State and its European \r\nintegration process, which we wholeheartedly support.\r\nTwo years ago, through the adoption of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, the international \r\ncommunity properly recognized the limits to the reach \r\nof individual Governments. Universal challenges indeed \r\ndemand our joint response. In addition, cooperation \r\nwith academia, the business community and civil \r\nsociety is indispensable, but it would be unwise not to \r\nalso tap the ideas and ingenuity of each individual in \r\nour respective societies, especially of our youth, who, in \r\nthe age of modern technology, are absorbing knowledge \r\nand acquiring skills in a faster and more open manner. \r\nIt is therefore our global task to adjust our educational \r\nsystems to form future responsible citizens, to give \r\nthem job opportunities and fit the real needs of our \r\nlabour markets. Coming from Croatia, the homeland of \r\nthe great inventor Nikola Tesla, I cannot but stress how \r\nvitally important it is that the United Nations facilitate \r\na transformation towards the age of the digital economy \r\nand narrow the digital divide, which could generate \r\nnew inequalities.\r\nEradicating poverty remains our primary \r\ndevelopment objective, since it is a cause and \r\nconsequence of conflict, instability and crises. But it \r\nis only by paying equal attention to transformational, \r\ncross-cutting elements — such as human rights, \r\nequality, good governance, the rule of law and inclusive \r\nsocieties — that we will be able to achieve true \r\nsustainable development.\r\nAs we are witnessing the daily erosion of climate \r\nconditions and increasing natural disasters, more is \r\nrequired from humankind. That burden is ours to \r\nbear. In recent months, unfortunately, my country \r\nwas not spared wildfires and f loods either, which \r\nreached unprecedented dimensions. Those increasingly \r\nworrying warnings are a call to action, without delay. \r\nCroatia has already demonstrated its dedication to \r\nglobal efforts to preserve the environment by ratifying \r\nthe Paris Agreement. Two days ago I expressed our \r\nprincipled support to the new French initiative — the \r\nGlobal Pact for the Environment — aimed at better \r\ncoordinating global action against climate change.\r\nIn the context of sustainable development, \r\nsynergies among global, national and local policies \r\nneed to be strengthened. We believe that next year’s \r\nHigh-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development \r\nwill offer a platform to discuss efficient measures for \r\na true transformation towards sustainable and resilient \r\nsocieties, such as the pivotal goal of making cities and \r\nhuman settlements inclusive and safe, while granting \r\ntheir inhabitants a proper quality of life.\r\nCroatia’s commitment to multilateralism is unwavering. \r\nWe believe in the United Nations system and our joint \r\npotential to promote effective, inclusive and sustainable \r\nglobal governance based on the rules and principles \r\nof international law. It is with that aspiration in mind \r\nthat Croatia joined the United Nations 25 years ago. A \r\nquarter of a century later, I stand before the Assembly \r\nwith the same noble ambitions and responsibility for \r\nrespect of human rights and fundamental freedoms, \r\ndemocracy and economic betterment, for solidarity \r\nwith humans living in precarious conditions and for \r\ncommon issues concerning our planet. Only with joint \r\nvigour to that end can we advance and materialize our \r\nprofessed common goals and values. It is incumbent \r\nupon us to do so, and the time is now.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Prime Minister of Croatia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Andrej Plenković, Prime Minister of Croatia, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n10/33 17-29585\r\nAddress by Mr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister \r\nof Canada\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of Canada.\r\nMr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of \r\nCanada, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Trudeau (Canada): Before I begin, in the \r\nlight of Tuesday’s earthquake in Mexico, I would \r\nlike to offer Canada’s condolences to all families and \r\nfriends in mourning. We wish a speedy recovery for all \r\nthose who were injured and thank all first responders \r\nfor their tireless efforts to help keep people safe. Our \r\nthoughts are also with our friends in the Caribbean, \r\nwho continue to suffer from devastating hurricanes. \r\nThe generosity and resilience that millions have shown \r\nin the face of those natural disasters is an inspiration to \r\nthe world. Canada stands ready to lend a helping hand \r\nwhenever we can.\r\nIt is an honour to be back here at the General \r\nAssembly today and to have an opportunity to speak \r\nto this year’s theme, namely, “Focusing on people: \r\nStriving for peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet”.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nPeople. Peace. A good quality of life and an \r\nenvironment that we take care of. Equality for all, \r\nno matter where. That is what counts in the eyes of \r\nCanadians. Throughout our history, we have worked \r\ntirelessly to realize our ambitions both at home and \r\nelsewhere in the world. Today I would like to speak \r\nabout the difficult lessons that Canada has learned \r\nalong the way. Canada is not a wonderland where the \r\ndifficulties experienced by others do not exist. We face \r\nthe same challenges. Canada is continually evolving.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nCanada remains a work in progress. I want to \r\ntell the Assembly about the Canadian experience \r\nbecause, for all the mistakes we have made, we remain \r\nhopeful — hopeful that we can do better, and be better, \r\nand treat each other with the dignity and the respect \r\nthat is the birthright of every human being. I want to \r\ntell the Assembly our story because I know that the \r\nchallenges we have faced, and continue to face, are not \r\nunique in the world, nor are the solutions. An approach \r\nthat values human dignity and emphasizes fairness and \r\nreal opportunity for everyone has a home in Canada \r\nand in every country. It is an approach that does not \r\njust serve domestic needs but makes the world a better, \r\nmore peaceful, more prosperous place for all.\r\nMr. Llorenty Solíz (Plurinational State of Bolivia), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThis year Canada celebrates the 150th anniversary \r\nof out Confederation. But Canada is much older than \r\nthat. It has been home to the descendants of settlers \r\nand immigrants for hundreds of years, and indigenous \r\npeoples for millenniums. We are a country that is built \r\non different cultures, different religions and different \r\nlanguages all coming together. Such diversity has \r\nbecome our great strength.\r\nBut that is not, and has not always been, true for \r\neveryone who shares our land. Canada is built on the \r\nancestral land of indigenous peoples, but, regrettably, \r\nit is also a country that came into being without the \r\nmeaningful participation of those who were there \r\nfirst. Even treaties that were developed to provide \r\na foundation for proper relations have not been fully \r\nhonoured or implemented. For First Nations, Métis \r\nNation and Inuit peoples in Canada, those early colonial \r\nrelationships were not about strength through diversity \r\nor a celebration of our differences. For indigenous \r\npeoples in Canada, their experience was mostly one of \r\nhumiliation, neglect and abuse.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThey were victims of a Government that did not \r\nrespect them; their traditions, their assets, their way of \r\ngoverning or their laws. It chose to deny and undermine \r\ntheir rights and their dignity. They were victims of a \r\nGovernment that sought to rewrite their unique history \r\nand eradicate their languages and cultures by imposing \r\ncolonial traditions and their own way of life. They were \r\nvictims of a Government that refused to protect their \r\nlands and waters and that rejected their principle of \r\nalways thinking seven generations ahead.\r\nIn short, we rejected the very idea of entire \r\ngenerations of indigenous peoples defining their own \r\nlives with the dignity and pride they are due. We have \r\ndeprived Canada of the significant contributions that \r\nthose generations could have made to the progression of \r\nour great country. The inability of successive Canadian \r\nGovernments to respect the rights of indigenous \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 11/33\r\npeoples in Canada causes us great shame. For too many \r\nindigenous peoples, that lack of respect for their rights \r\npersists today.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nToday there are still children living on reserves \r\nin Canada who cannot safely drink, bathe in or even \r\nplay in the water that comes out of their taps. There are \r\nindigenous parents who say goodnight to their children \r\nand have to cross their fingers in the hope that their \r\nkids will not run away or take their own lives in the \r\nnight. Young indigenous people in Canada struggle to \r\nget a good education. Although residential schools are \r\nthankfully a thing of the past, too many indigenous \r\nyouth are still sent away, far from their families, just \r\nto get the basic education most Canadians take for \r\ngranted. For far too many indigenous women, life in \r\nCanada includes threats of violence so frequent and \r\nsevere that Amnesty International has called it a human \r\nrights crisis.\r\nThat is the legacy of colonialism in Canada, of a \r\npaternalistic Indian Act, of the forced relocation of \r\nInuit and First Nations communities and a systematic \r\ndenial of Métis rights and history, of residential \r\nschools that separated children as young as 5 years old \r\nfrom their families, punished them for speaking their \r\nown language and sought to extinguish indigenous \r\ncultures entirely.\r\nThe good news is that Canadians get it. They see \r\nthe inequities, and they are fed up with the excuses. And \r\nthat impatience gives us a rare and precious opportunity \r\nto act. We now have before us an opportunity to deliver \r\ntrue, meaningful and lasting reconciliation between \r\nCanada and First Nations, the Métis Nation, and \r\nInuit peoples.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nAt a time where we seek to reconcile, we should be \r\nguided by the basic standards adopted in this Hall 10 \r\nyears ago this month. I know that in the past Canada’s \r\nposition on the United Nations Declaration on the \r\nRights of Indigenous Peoples was disappointing. We \r\nactively campaigned and voted against such rights, only \r\nto finally accept them reluctantly by saying that it was \r\nsimply a document of aspirations. However, they are \r\nnot aspirations. The Declaration is very concrete for \r\nindigenous peoples and for those who who worked long \r\nand hard to make that document a reality.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn the words of the Truth and Reconciliation \r\nCommission of Canada, the Declaration provides \r\nthe necessary principles, norms and standards for \r\nreconciliation to f lourish in twenty-first-century \r\nCanada. That is not an aspiration, that is a way \r\nforward. Last year, at the United Nations Permanent \r\nForum on Indigenous Issues, Canada’s then Minister \r\nof Indigenous and Northern Affairs finally corrected \r\nCanada’s position on the Declaration, and announced \r\nthat we are now, without qualification, a full supporter \r\nof the Declaration.\r\nIn partnership with indigenous peoples, we are \r\nmoving ahead with a thorough review of federal laws, \r\npolicies and operational practices to get our house in \r\norder and make sure that our Government is meeting \r\nits obligations, including international obligations \r\nunder the Declaration. We know that the world expects \r\nCanada to strictly adhere to international human rights \r\nstandards — including the United Nations Declaration \r\non the Rights of Indigenous Peoples — and that is what \r\nwe expect of ourselves too.\r\nWe are working closely with indigenous peoples in \r\nCanada to better respond to their priorities, to better \r\nunderstand how they see and define self-determination \r\nand to support their work of nation rebuilding. Along \r\nwith indigenous partners, we are co-developing \r\nprogrammes to ensure the preservation, protection \r\nand revitalization of Métis, Inuit and First Nations \r\nlanguages. In short, we have been working hard, in \r\npartnership with other orders of Government and with \r\nindigenous leaders in Canada, to correct past injustices \r\nand to bring about a better quality of life for indigenous \r\npeoples in Canada.\r\nI will give a few examples. Many will sound familiar \r\nbecause they are closely aligned with the United Nations \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) — goals that \r\napply to all of our countries without exception. Our \r\nefforts include investments to help bring safe and clean \r\ndrinking water to all indigenous communities, part of \r\nSustainable Development Goal 6, on clean water and \r\nsanitation. So far, more than two dozen long-term \r\ndrinking-water advisories in indigenous communities \r\nhave been eliminated, and we have a plan to bring to an \r\nend those that remain.\r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n12/33 17-29585\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nThose efforts take the form of new investments to \r\neliminate gaps in the education of First Nations. The \r\nnew agreements recognize the power and authority of \r\nFirst Nations. They also consider ways to create and \r\nmanage educational systems that are managed within \r\nthe communities, by the communities and for the \r\ncommunities. Those important notions are in line with \r\nSustainable Development Goal 4, on quality education.\r\nFor many indigenous peoples in Canada, among \r\nother things, those investments will enable laying the \r\nfoundation for reaching Sustainable Development Goal \r\n8, on decent work and economic growth. We know that \r\nno one can hope to have a true and equal chance of \r\nsucceeding without good health, a solid community, a \r\nwell-paid quality job, quality education and safe and \r\naffordable housing. Of course, that also applies to \r\nindigenous peoples.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nThat is why our efforts include working with \r\nindigenous communities to help build and refurbish \r\nhomes. Construction work on nearly 4,000 homes has \r\nbeen completed or is under way, helping to fulfil SDG \r\n11, on making communities safe and sustainable places \r\nto live. And across the country, we are also working \r\non a national housing strategy to give more Canadians \r\naccess to housing that is safe, affordable and adequate.\r\nOur efforts also include a sharper focus on \r\nindigenous communities across Canada and around \r\nthe world as it relates to SDG 5, on combating gender-\r\nbased violence and giving women and girls equal \r\nopportunities to succeed. We need women and girls \r\nto succeed because that is how we grow stronger \r\neconomies and build stronger communities. That is why \r\nour Government will be moving forward shortly with \r\nlegislation to ensure equal pay for work of equal value.\r\nThe Sustainable Development Goals are as \r\nmeaningful in Canada as they are everywhere else in \r\nthe world. We are committed to implementing them \r\nat home, while we also work with our international \r\npartners to achieve them around the world. That \r\nis important, because poverty and hunger know \r\nno borders. We cannot pretend that those solvable \r\nchallenges happen only on distant shores. The need for \r\ngreater equality and decent work are real and persistent \r\nhuman needs — ones we cannot afford to ignore, \r\nespecially in our own countries.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIt is up to each of us to ensure that all of us, \r\nincluding indigenous peoples, have better opportunities. \r\nIt is our responsibility to ensure that true equality is \r\nunconditional. Equality applies to us all, regardless \r\nof our gender, origin, beliefs or the person we choose \r\nto love. It is our responsibility to take better care of \r\nthe environment that we all share. As I said here at \r\nthe signing ceremony of the Paris Agreement, we are \r\nall implicated, in all senses of the word. We are all \r\nresponsible, and our new ways of doing things must \r\ntake that into account.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nIn Canada that means new relationships \r\nbetween the Government of Canada and indigenous \r\npeoples — relationships based on recognition of rights, \r\nrespect, cooperation and partnership. We recently made \r\nchanges to our Government structures to help with the \r\ntransition to those new relationships with indigenous \r\npeoples. We are dismantling the old colonial bureaucratic \r\nstructures and creating a new Department of Crown-\r\nIndigenous Relations and Northern Affairs, led by \r\nCarolyn Bennett, an experienced and effective advocate \r\nfor indigenous peoples in Canada. In her new role, she \r\nwill lead our Government’s efforts to better support \r\nindigenous peoples as they strengthen their distinct \r\npolitical, cultural, legal and economic institutions and \r\nassume autonomy over their own affairs, including the \r\nrecognition and implementation of self-government as \r\nan expression of self-determination.\r\nAt the same time, we recognize that in Canada \r\nthe federal Government has a historic responsibility \r\nfor providing services to indigenous peoples and an \r\nongoing role to play. To better do that work while at the \r\nsame time supporting indigenous self-determination, \r\nin consultation with indigenous peoples, we will create \r\na new Department of Indigenous Services, led by our \r\nformer Minister of Health, Jane Philpott. Over time, \r\nprogrammes and services will increasingly be delivered \r\nby indigenous peoples, as part of their move towards \r\ntrue self-government and the full implementation \r\nof the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of \r\nIndigenous Peoples.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe believe that this separation is the best way \r\nfor Canada to meet its sustainable development \r\ncommitments, while following the principle of self-\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 13/33\r\ndetermination, which is at the heart of the Declaration. \r\nWe are in uncharted territory. No one has paved the way \r\nfor us, but we cannot wait. The time has come to take \r\nour own journey together. The time has come to think \r\noutside the box, to move away from the limits imposed \r\nby old outdated colonial structures and to make room \r\nfor innovation and structures that respect the inherent \r\nrights of indigenous peoples to govern themselves and \r\nto determine their own future.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nFor the federal Government, that means making \r\nchanges to how we operate. The departmental change \r\nI mentioned is part of fulfilling that responsibility. \r\nFor indigenous peoples, it means taking a hard look \r\nat how they define and govern themselves as nations \r\nand Governments, and how they seek to relate to other \r\norders of Government. Indigenous peoples will decide \r\nhow they wish to represent and organize themselves. \r\nSome may choose to engage with our Government \r\nbased on historic nations and treaties, others will use \r\ndifferent shared experiences as the basis for coming \r\ntogether. The choice is theirs. That is precisely what \r\nself-determination demands.\r\nAlthough that path is uncharted, I am confident \r\nthat we will reach a place of reconciliation, that we \r\nwill reach a place as a country where nation-to-\r\nnation, Government-to-Government and Inuit-Crown \r\nrelationships can be transformed — a place where the \r\nstandards enshrined in the United Nations Declaration \r\nof the Rights of Indigenous Peoples are fully realized \r\nnot merely by Government mandate, but in true \r\npartnership with indigenous peoples.\r\nPart of that new partnership will involve \r\naddressing the shared challenge of climate change. \r\nIndigenous and northern communities are particularly \r\naffected by its stark reality. In communities across \r\nthe north — places like Paulatuk, Kugluktuk, and \r\nTuktoyaktuk — community members are finding \r\nsea ice conditions more dangerous and unpredictable \r\nfor travelling and hunting in the winter. In Canada’s \r\nwestern Arctic, the permafrost is melting and huge \r\npieces of tundra are eroding into the ocean. Around \r\nBaffin Island, Inuit elders are finding it difficult to \r\nforecast the weather like they used to, so difficult that \r\nmany are now reluctant to even try.\r\nAt home, we are working hard to help those \r\ncommunities adapt and prepare for the future. At the \r\ninternational level, our commitment is unwavering. \r\nThere is no country on the planet that can walk away \r\nfrom the challenge and reality of climate change. For \r\nour part, Canada will continue to fight for the global \r\nplan that has a realistic chance of countering it. We \r\nhave a responsibility to future generations, and we will \r\nuphold it.\r\nWe have a chance to build in Canada and around the \r\nworld economies that are clean, that are growing, that \r\nare forward-looking. We will not let that opportunity \r\npass us by.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIn Canada that means imposing a tariff on \r\ncarbon-related pollution. When that is done properly, \r\nit is the most effective way of reducing emissions \r\nwhile continuing to grow the economy. It also means \r\ncontinuing to work with other countries to bring us \r\ncloser to the goals we have set for ourselves. Last week \r\nin Montreal, we welcomed environment leaders from \r\nover 30 countries to participate in a working meeting. It \r\nwas an opportunity for us to discuss the various ways of \r\nimplementing the Paris Agreement and to maintain the \r\ninternational momentum towards a more sustainable \r\nfuture for all.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nLikewise, the global community has a responsibility \r\nto do all that it can to reduce inequality within and \r\namong countries. In Canada we are working hard to \r\nachieve that goal. We improved child benefit payments. \r\nOur new programme gives nine out of 10 families \r\nmore money to help with the high cost of raising their \r\nkids, and because of that we expect to reduce child \r\npoverty in Canada by 40 per cent. We raised taxes on \r\nthe wealthiest 1 per cent so that we could lower them \r\nfor the middle class, and we are continuing to look for \r\nways to make our tax system more fair. Right now we \r\nhave a system that encourages wealthy Canadians to \r\nuse private corporations to pay a lower tax rate than \r\nmiddle-class Canadians. That is not fair, and we are \r\ngoing to fix it.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe are investing to make education more affordable \r\nand accessible so that every Canadian can get the \r\ntraining needed to find and keep a good, well-paying \r\njob. That is particularly important at a time when \r\nautomation is challenging the traditional definition \r\nof work.\r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n14/33 17-29585\r\nAt the international level, we have reaffirmed \r\nCanada’s commitment to reducing poverty and \r\ninjustice, while also putting gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women and girls at the heart of our \r\ndevelopment efforts. We have adopted that approach \r\nbecause we know that supporting women and girls leads \r\nto economic growth, and that peace and cooperation \r\ncan then take root. Families and communities can then \r\nhope for a better quality of life.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nWe are also working hard to deliver progressive \r\ntrade agreements such as the Comprehensive Economic \r\nand Trade Agreement (CETA) with the European \r\nUnion, which comes into effect today. CETA will \r\nexpand opportunities for businesses, create good, \r\nwell-paying jobs for workers and deliver meaningful \r\neconomic growth — the kind of growth that benefits \r\nall our citizens, not just the wealthiest. We have the \r\nopportunity — and I would argue that we have the \r\nresponsibility — to ensure that trade agreements \r\ninclude strong provisions to safeguard workers’ rights, \r\nto protect the environment and to ensure that the \r\nbenefits of trade are felt more broadly. When we do \r\nthat, we do not just grow our economies, we live up to \r\nour values. We say to ourselves and to one another that \r\ngood enough just is not good enough, and that better is \r\nalways possible.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nIt is always possible to do better when people are \r\nat the heart of the decisions we make. People, as the \r\ntheme of this general debate reminds us, are the key to \r\nbuilding a peaceful and prosperous future. It is a future \r\nthat we all want for ourselves, for our children and for \r\nour grandchildren. It is a future in which indigenous \r\npeople in Canada and around the world have the right to \r\nparticipate as equal partners. It is a future that we can \r\nbuild if we work together.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nOur efforts to build a better relationship with \r\nindigenous peoples in Canada are not only about \r\nrighting historical wrongs. They are about listening, \r\nlearning and working together. They are also about \r\nconcrete actions for the future. The reconciliation that \r\nwe seek holds lessons for us all.\r\nWe cannot build strong relationships if we refuse \r\nto have conversations. We cannot chart a more peaceful \r\npath if the starting point is suspicion and mistrust. And \r\nwe cannot build a better world unless we work together, \r\nrespect our differences, protect the vulnerable and \r\nstand up for the things that matter most. As I said last \r\nyear (see A/71/PV.8), I know that it will be hard work. \r\nBut I remain confident — for Canada’s experience \r\nshows it to be true — that any challenge can be met if \r\nwe meet it together.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of Canada for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, \r\nwas escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State \r\nof Samoa\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of \r\nthe Independent State of Samoa, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Tuilaepa Sailele \r\nMalielegaoi, Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of the Independent State of Samoa, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Malielegaoi (Samoa): Samoa warmly welcomes \r\nthe assumption of Mr. Miroslav Lajčák to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session, \r\nat a time when our Organization is going through \r\nunprecedentedly volatile and difficult times. We look \r\nforward to his leadership so that together we can chart \r\na safer, more predictable and more humane pathway \r\nin our journey through life’s uncharted waters. He can \r\ncount on Samoa’s support as we work in partnership \r\nto translate into tangible and measurable achievements \r\nthe overarching theme of his tenure, “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet”.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 15/33\r\nThe President’s predecessor, Ambassador Peter \r\nThomson of Fiji, demonstrated strong leadership \r\nduring his successful presidency. We wish him well in \r\nhis new calling.\r\nSecretary-General Guterres is passionate about, \r\nand committed to, turning the United Nations into \r\nan efficient and effective Organization that is fit for \r\npurpose and readily responsive to the needs of the very \r\npeoples it was established to serve in the first place. In \r\nworking to make the focus of the United Nations more \r\npeople-centred than process-centred, Samoa assures \r\nthe Secretary-General of its full support.\r\nThis week’s annual general debate is the twentieth \r\nsuccessive general debate of the General Assembly \r\nthat I have attended and addressed. My continuous \r\nparticipation is a measure of my conviction and my \r\nGovernment’s unqualified faith in the value of the \r\nUnited Nations and the endless potential that it holds to \r\ndeal successfully with any issue of diversity and gravity \r\nthat it confronts. The United Nations remains our choice \r\nof last resort and hope to provide the political will and \r\nthe necessary commitment to address our challenges. \r\nThat is why we want it to remain relevant and adaptable \r\nto changing circumstances. It must be able to respond \r\neffectively to the current and emerging challenges that \r\nour world faces.\r\nWe meet against the backdrop of a world plagued by \r\nuncertainty and a sense of ebbing hope. We are losing \r\nthe fight to free our world from poverty and instability. \r\nConflicts abound, and we are no longer distanced or \r\ndisconnected from deadly acts of terrorism and the \r\ndevastation of natural and human-induced disasters. \r\nWe are living in an environment of risk. Climate \r\nchange is an existential threat. Allow me to pause and \r\noffer our sincere condolences to the Governments and \r\nthe peoples of all the countries that have suffered from \r\nthe recent devastation of hurricanes and earthquakes.\r\nWe cannot help but watch with trepidation and \r\nuneasiness the global dynamics that are nudging our \r\nworld perilously close to a potential catastrophe of \r\nunimaginable proportions. As small island Pacific \r\ncountries, we are no longer protected by our isolation. \r\nWe are bystanders, but we have the most to lose in the \r\nunfolding power drama being played out on the Korean \r\npeninsula. We pray for visionary leadership with sound \r\nmoral judgment on both sides in order to ensure that we \r\ngive peace a chance.\r\nThat explains why I signed the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons yesterday on Samoa’s \r\nbehalf. As a signatory to that historic Treaty, we wanted \r\nto demonstrate unequivocally our aspiration for a world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons. The conventional narrative \r\nthat the possession of nuclear weapons will act as \r\ndeterrent to make the world a safer place to live has \r\nnot been borne out by the current realities. Otherwise, \r\nthe developments on the Korean peninsula would not \r\nhave happened at all. We firmly believe that possessing \r\nnuclear weapons and adding new nuclear Powers only \r\nmake our world less safe, less secure and less peaceful, \r\nhence the need to rid our world completely of all \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nNo matter how noble a goal lies behind having \r\nsuch arsenals, allowing them to fall into the wrong and \r\nunprincipled hands is a recipe for doom and mayhem, \r\nbecause people, after all, are human and mere mortals. \r\nBut all is not yet lost. The adoption of the New York \r\nDeclaration for Refugees and Migrants, which offers \r\na united approach to addressing the plight of the \r\nworld’s displaced peoples, the creation of the United \r\nNations Office of Counter-Terrorism, which is aimed \r\nat enhancing the Organization’s capability to assist \r\nMember States in implementing the United Nations \r\nGlobal Counter-Terrorism Strategy, and the historic, \r\nfirst-ever Treaty banning nuclear weapons are all \r\npositive developments moving forward.\r\nLike other global challenges, climate change \r\ntranscends borders without leaving a trace. It has no \r\nrespect for sovereignty and does not discriminate \r\nbetween rich and poor countries. Its dire consequences \r\nare real, including for those who remain in denial. \r\nClimate change is a perpetual priority issue for my \r\ncountry and our Pacific region. In our small islands, \r\nas we witnessed recently, natural catastrophes can \r\ndecimate an entire country, bringing with them great \r\npain and upheaval to peoples’ lives, as well as set \r\nback the national economy for years. We know that \r\nfrom repeated past experience. Our islands’ limited \r\nresources and lack of adaptive capacity make the burden \r\nof rehabilitation a mammoth undertaking. While we \r\napplaud the resilience of our people to bounce back \r\nfrom major natural disasters, the scars of those natural \r\nphenomena take years to heal and recover from. If it is \r\nany consolation to our island States, even some of the \r\nwell-resourced developed countries continue to try to \r\nrecover from and overcome the impact of catastrophes \r\nthat devastated their economies.\r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n16/33 17-29585\r\nSamoa remains committed to ongoing efforts to \r\npursue respect for human rights and the rule of law, and \r\ndoes its part to contribute to that global effort. For the \r\nfirst time ever, at Samoa’s invitation, a United Nations \r\nhuman rights expert group visited last month to carry \r\nout a fact-finding mission to assess the progress made \r\ntowards eliminating discrimination against women and \r\ntowards protecting and promoting women’s rights in \r\nthe country. Samoa is the first Pacific country to open \r\nits doors to that independent mechanism.\r\nWe continue to place great faith in the rule of law \r\nand the vital protection it offers to all States, especially \r\nto weak and small countries like mine without any \r\narmed forces or affiliation to any military grouping. \r\nThe International Criminal Court (ICC) is an important \r\npart of the architecture of world peace based on the rule \r\nof law. We call for the early activation of the Kampala \r\nAmendments. The ICC was represented at the Pacific \r\nIslands Forum Special Leaders’ Retreat held earlier this \r\nmonth in Samoa.\r\nTerrorism is an offence to humankind and runs \r\ncontrary to the core values of the United Nations. For \r\nSamoa, I reaffirm our strong support for the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions against terrorism, which \r\nsend a clear signal of our determination to suppress \r\nterrorist activities, including training, international \r\nrecruiting and financing. Samoa continues to align \r\nits domestic policies and legislation to meeting its \r\ninternational obligations to help combat terrorism, \r\nas well as to participate actively in Pacific regional \r\nsecurity initiatives.\r\nIn the context of peacekeeping, Samoa’s \r\nunwavering support for United Nations peacekeeping \r\nwork is underscored by 17 years of uninterrupted police \r\ndeployment serving in missions in Liberia, the Sudan, \r\nTimor-Leste and South Sudan. Although we are a small \r\ncountry, Samoan police officers continue to serve side \r\nby side with officers from other countries in places \r\nthat require the intervention of the United Nations. \r\nOur commitment is rooted in our firm belief in the \r\nrole that United Nations peacekeeping plays in helping \r\neliminate the causes of conflict and in bringing about \r\npeace and stability. We fully endorse the condemnation \r\nof sexual exploitation and abuse in peacekeeping, which \r\nis why we signed the international compact initiative \r\nof the Secretary-General to committing countries to \r\neliminating those heinous acts in peacekeeping.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nprovides our framework to put the world on a path \r\ntowards a sustainable and resilient future for the people, \r\nthe planet and prosperity. Although the 2030 Agenda \r\nremains a high priority on the global agenda and we \r\nsee signs of momentum in terms of its implementation, \r\nmuch work remains to be done. The need to accelerate \r\nglobal action on, and awareness of, the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) remains. The adoption of \r\nthe Pacific regional road map for implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development in Asia and \r\nthe Pacific complements Samoa’s road map based on \r\nan integrated approach involving the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, the Small Island Developing States \r\n(SIDS) Accelerated Modalities of Action, known as the \r\nSamoa Pathway, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nand the Framework for Pacific Regionalism, which are \r\naligned with our national development strategy.\r\nFor small island developing States, the Samoa \r\nPathway is their sustainable development road map, \r\nwhich highlights their key tasks and priorities, and is \r\nclosely linked to the 2030 Agenda. As we approach the \r\nfive-year review of the Samoa Pathway in 2019, it is \r\nimportant to ensure that the comprehensive review of \r\nUnited Nations support for SIDS is properly addressed \r\nand implemented. We need to study closely lessons \r\nlearned from the partnerships registered for SIDS and \r\nencourage proactive follow-up, as well as pursue new \r\npartnerships for the group’s sustainable development.\r\nSince the last annual global multi-stakeholder small \r\nisland developing States partnership dialogue, several \r\npartnerships and voluntary commitments specific to \r\nsmall island developing States were launched during the \r\nOcean Conference. Prior to the mid-term review of the \r\nSIDS outcome document, it is important that we look \r\nat ways of improving implementation and addressing \r\ngaps and emerging issues. The success of the Ocean \r\nConference was crucial to building momentum in the \r\nimplementation of the SDGs, given that the ocean is the \r\nlifeblood of the planet. Addressing the targets of SDG \r\n14 for SIDS is catalytic to implementing several, if not \r\nall, of the 17 Goals.\r\nWith the new Blue Pacific concept for the Pacific \r\nregion, and the concrete outcomes from the Conference, \r\nemphasis will be placed on implementation. At the \r\nOcean Conference, Samoa pledged 13 voluntary \r\ncommitments that showcased national efforts aimed \r\nat the conservation, management and sustainable use \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 17/33\r\nof the ocean and its resources and the engagement \r\nof communities.\r\nDuring the Ocean Conference in June, I was \r\nappointed the Special Ambassador of the International \r\nYear of Sustainable Tourism for Development by the \r\nUnited Nations World Tourism Organization. The year \r\n2017 is a crucial one for sustainable tourism. Given the \r\nreliance of many of our small economies on tourism \r\nand the role it can play in SDG implementation, we will \r\ncontinue to promote the role of tourism in support of \r\npeaceful societies and sustainable development.\r\nLet me now turn to the regional context and share \r\nwith the Assembly some of the decisions taken by the \r\nleaders of our Pacific Islands Forum at their forty-\r\neighth Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting, which \r\nmy country was privileged to host at the beginning of \r\nthe month. For our year-long chairmanship we chose \r\nthe theme “The Blue Pacific: Our sea of islands — Our \r\nsecurity through sustainable development, management \r\nand conservation”.\r\nWe in Samoa reaffirmed the Framework for Pacific \r\nRegionalism to drive our region’s policy agenda towards \r\nthe realization of our vision, that of a region of peace, \r\nharmony, security, social inclusion and prosperity, so \r\nas to enable all Pacific people to lead free, healthy and \r\nproductive lives.\r\nWe also endorsed the Blue Pacific identity as \r\nthe core driver of collective action for advancing \r\nthe leaders’ vision under the Framework for Pacific \r\nRegionalism. This new narrative calls for inspired \r\nleadership and a long-term Pacific Islands Forum \r\nforeign policy commitment to act as one for the good of \r\nall rather than a few. The Blue Pacific identity reinforces \r\nthe potential of our shared stewardship of the Pacific \r\nOcean, based on the explicit recognition of our shared \r\nocean identity, ocean geography and ocean resources. \r\nIt aims to strengthen collective action by putting the \r\nBlue Pacific at the centre of regional policymaking and \r\nunited action for advancing the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nLeaders’ vision for the region.\r\nWe discussed the key priorities for our region with \r\nother Pacific leaders, a few of which I will highlight, \r\nas their implementation requires collective and urgent \r\naction from this gathering of the United Nations.\r\nFirst, climate change remains a priority challenge \r\nfor the Pacific region because of its existential nature \r\nand its security implications. Climate change is already \r\nhappening; it cannot be washed away by the rising \r\ntides. It has significant security implications. Its impact \r\nthreatens the continued existence and viability as \r\nsovereign States of some of our low-lying atolls. Even \r\ncountries that have been in self-denial with regard to \r\nthe phenomenon of climate change, must surely now \r\naccept the weight of scientific evidence.\r\nThe implementation of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change is of high priority and requires \r\ncollective action to address this existential threat. \r\nWe are confident that Fiji’s presidency of the twenty-\r\nthird Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change will focus \r\nthe spotlight on challenges and the need for genuine \r\npartnerships to help us deliver on our nationally \r\ndetermined contributions as part of the implementation \r\nof the Paris Agreement. The Pacific has also endorsed \r\nits Framework for Resilience Development in the \r\nPacific: An Integrated Approach to Address Climate \r\nChange and Disaster Risk Management and its \r\ninstitutional arrangements to support the elaboration \r\nand implementation of the Paris Agreement.\r\nSecondly, the ocean and its resources continue to be \r\ncritical to the livelihoods of our people and the region. \r\nThe impacts of climate change, illegal, unregulated and \r\nunreported fishing and overfishing are threatening the \r\nsustainability of this crucial resource of our region. The \r\nPacific Forum members will continue to be actively \r\nengaged on all ocean-related issues at the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, including the \r\nbiodiversity beyond national jurisdiction process.\r\nThirdly, we adopted the Pacific Road Map for \r\nSustainable Development and its implementation \r\nstrategy. That reflects the seriousness our region places \r\non implementing the 17 SDGs and the importance of \r\na regional approach to meeting those international \r\ncommitments. We continue to count on the important \r\nrole of the United Nations and our partners to support \r\nregional and national efforts for SDG implementation, \r\nparticularly the building of our capabilities. We look \r\nforward to the Secretary-General’s reform and how the \r\nForum can engage to ensure its priorities in terms of its \r\nSDG road map and the implementation of the Samoa \r\nPathway, the Paris Agreement and other regional needs \r\nare considered in the reform.\r\nFinally, in the context of security, the Pacific Islands \r\nForum remains committed to collective arrangements \r\nand mechanisms to assist regional Governments \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n18/33 17-29585\r\nrecover from national conflicts and crises. The success \r\nof thse arrangements, together with the support of \r\nthe United Nations, is already evident in the positive \r\nresults of the Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon \r\nIslands (RAMSI). I am honoured to acknowledge the \r\nsuccessful conclusion of the Mission, which brought \r\ntogether peacekeepers from all member countries of the \r\nPacific Islands Forum.\r\nLeaders acknowledged the successful conclusion \r\nof RAMSI and recognized it as a success story of \r\nregionalism and a workable example of regional \r\ncooperation and diplomacy, embodying more than \r\na decade of partnership and cooperation among the \r\nForum member countries. They agreed to build on the \r\nBiketawa Declaration and other Forum security-related \r\ndeclarations to expand the concept of security, including \r\nhuman security, humanitarian assistance, prioritizing \r\nenvironmental security and regional cooperation in \r\nbuilding resilience to disasters and climate change.\r\nOver the years, the Pacific has continued to call for \r\nadvancing the cause of nuclear non-proliferation. Issues \r\nsuch as radioactive contaminants in the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands are of great concern to both that country \r\nand the region. We count on the promised support of the \r\nrelevant United Nations entities to respond accordingly \r\nto requests for assistance, including working closely \r\nwith the regional technical agencies. The United States \r\nof America is also encouraged to take urgent action to \r\naddress the issue.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Trade of the Independent State of Samoa for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of the \r\nIndependent State of Samoa, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Miro Cerar, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Slovenia\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by His Excellency \r\nMr. Miro Cerar, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia.\r\nMr. Miro Cerar, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nSlovenia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Miro \r\nCerar, Prime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Cerar (Slovenia): At the outset, I would like \r\nto express our sympathies to Mexico and its people as \r\nthey grapple with the effects of the earthquake that has \r\nresulted in so many tragic victims and ruined homes.\r\nI would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on \r\nhis election to the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-second session and to wish him every \r\nsuccess in discharging his duties. He can count on \r\nSlovenia’s full support. I would also like to to express \r\nmy gratitude to the outgoing President, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, for his important contribution to the work \r\nof the General Assembly over the past year. Lastly, I \r\nwould also like to congratulate Mr. António Guterres \r\non his appointment as Secretary-General. I commend \r\nhis determination to promote the United Nations and its \r\nvalues and goals, and his tireless efforts to strengthen \r\nthe Organization.\r\nThe world continues to deal with challenges to \r\ninternational peace and security that are ever more \r\ncomplex and intertwined. Shocking images of human \r\nsuffering are a daily reality, the consequences of the \r\narmed conflicts, environmental degradation, famine, \r\nlack of economic opportunity, grave breaches of \r\nhuman rights and terrorism that are just some of those \r\nglobal challenges. If we are to address them, effective \r\ninternational cooperation, with the United Nations \r\nat its core, is essential. We have the mandate and the \r\nresponsibility to act. We must stand united to address \r\nglobal challenges together. Despite those threats, I am \r\nencouraged by a new dynamic in the United Nations and \r\nthe strong push by the Secretary-General to strengthen \r\nmultilateralism and the reform agenda. I commend his \r\ndetermination to make the Organization stronger and \r\nmore fit to serve as the bedrock of the international \r\nrules-based order. More than ever, we need a strong \r\nUnited Nations to be one of our key actors in providing \r\nsecurity, stability and a life of dignity for all.\r\nTwo years ago, we achieved a milestone by agreeing \r\non our development road map. Together, the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) and the Paris Climate \r\nChange Agreement provide a framework and vision for \r\na more sustainable planet in the future and prosperity \r\nfor all. The true test now is their implementation. This \r\nis not the time to go back on our promises. Rather, we \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 19/33\r\nneed to turn them into real progress that will benefit \r\npeople around the globe. Slovenia has embarked on that \r\npath with a sense of urgency. That is demonstrated, \r\namong other things, by Slovenia’s high ranking in \r\nthe SDG Index and Dashboards 2017 Report, which \r\nshows that we are in the top 10 of 157 measured \r\ncountries in our achievements towards the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nWe are strongly engaged in protecting the \r\nenvironment and ensuring its sustainability, and \r\nwe are determined to raise awareness about the key \r\nfactors shaping our sustainable future. For example, \r\nwe recognize the key role that bees and other \r\npollinators play in preventing hunger, ensuring food \r\nsecurity, improving human health and preserving the \r\nenvironment and its biodiversity. In that context, we are \r\nproposing that the General Assembly declare 20 May \r\nan international day of bees and proclaim it World \r\nBee Day. I would like to thank all of the States that \r\nhave already expressed support for the initiative and \r\nencourage others to do so.\r\nAchieving sustainable development is only \r\npossible if the global community works together in a \r\nsolid partnership between Governments, international \r\norganizations, civil society, academia and the private \r\nsector. The same is true for dealing with large global \r\nmigrations and refugee f lows. Shared responsibility and \r\nsolidarity should be the guiding principles of our global \r\napproach. In that spirit, Slovenia is constructively \r\nengaged in the consultation process for the global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration and \r\nthe global compact on refugees. We believe that the \r\nadoption in 2018 of both global compacts will be \r\nanother major milestone in our path towards ensuring a \r\nlife of dignity for all.\r\nWithout respect for human rights, there can be no \r\npeace, freedom, security or development. The United \r\nNations has been instrumental in promoting respect for \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms worldwide. \r\nHowever, let us not forget that the primary responsibility \r\nfor the fulfilment of human rights lies with States. \r\nSlovenia, as a current member of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, is a strong supporter of human rights. In that \r\nspirit, we continue to advocate a progressive approach \r\nto human rights issues, enhancing protection norms \r\nand standards at all levels. Our main focus is on the \r\nrights of children, support for gender equality and the \r\nempowerment of women, as well as the rights of the \r\nelderly. In that context, we also focus on the importance \r\nof intergenerational collaboration.\r\nThere is still much to be done before we can ensure a \r\nlife of dignity for all without discrimination. More must \r\nalso be done to mitigate harm to civilians, especially in \r\nthe context of armed conflicts, and to prevent all forms \r\nof sexual violence. It is particularly despicable when \r\npeople deployed to protect civilians engage in abuse. \r\nWe therefore underline the need for a zero-tolerance \r\npolicy on all forms of sexual exploitation and abuse.\r\nRespect for international treaties, the decisions of \r\ninternational courts and tribunals and other sources of \r\ninternational law, as well as the ability to implement \r\nthem, is indispensable to a functioning global \r\ncommunity. Respect for the obligations arising from \r\ntreaties and for other sources of international law is \r\nalso embedded in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nand is the very foundation of international peace \r\nand security. Moreover, it is an important guarantor \r\nof friendly relations and cooperation among States. \r\nSlovenia recognizes the essential role of the rule of law \r\nand international law and has therefore made it central \r\nto its foreign policy.\r\nIn the context of the rule of law, ending impunity \r\nfor the most serious international crimes continues to \r\nbe an important goal for my Government. Slovenia is \r\ncommitted to promoting international criminal justice, \r\nespecially as it is represented by the International \r\nCriminal Court (ICC). The principles enshrined in the \r\nCharter attest to the natural partnership between the \r\nUnited Nations and the Court, and that relationship is \r\nexpected to advance even further with the activation \r\nof the ICC’s jurisdiction over the crime of aggression, \r\nwhich is anticipated by the end of the year. We express \r\nour strong support for swift activation of the Kampala \r\namendments on the crime of aggression. Needless to \r\nsay, the primary responsibility to prosecute atrocity \r\ncrimes still rests with States. Slovenia, together with \r\nother leading States, will continue to actively pursue \r\nthe improvement of the international legal framework \r\nfor mutual legal assistance and extradition for domestic \r\nprosecution of the most serious international crimes.\r\nYears of horrific war in Syria, conflicts in \r\nAfghanistan, Yemen, Iraq, Libya and Mali and dire \r\nsituations such as those in South Sudan and the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, to name just a few, \r\nremain particular sources of concern. We call on all \r\nrelevant parties to refrain from the use of force and \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n20/33 17-29585\r\nengage in political dialogue. Violent extremism and \r\nthe crimes committed by terrorist groups continue to \r\nplague the world. We must do all we can to prevent \r\nand stop such crimes, particularly by providing viable \r\nalternative opportunities for young people.\r\nThe United Nations plays a key role in countering \r\nterrorism, including the prevention of violent extremism. \r\nIn that regard, Slovenia welcomed the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations counter-terrorism architecture, as well \r\nas resolution 71/291, designed to strengthen the ability \r\nof the United Nations system to assist Member States \r\nin implementing the United Nations Global Counter-\r\nTerrorism Strategy.\r\nAs a strong supporter of non-proliferation and \r\ndisarmament in the area of weapons of mass destruction, \r\nSlovenia is committed to treaty-based nuclear \r\ndisarmament and arms control. We firmly believe \r\nthat we must work progressively to achieve a world \r\nfree of nuclear weapons through full implementation \r\nof the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. In that regard, we strongly condemn the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s violations of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and its own international \r\ncommitments. They pose a serious threat to peace and \r\nsecurity in the region and beyond. We must intensify \r\nour efforts to sustain peace everywhere, but most \r\nimmediately in a wide range of fragile and conflict-\r\naffected States. Conflicts cannot be prevented or \r\nresolved by addressing the symptoms alone; we must \r\naddress the underlying causes. For that we have to \r\nthink long term. The United Nations can help to defuse \r\nlatent conflicts. Whenever possible, we should opt for \r\ndiplomacy, mediation and conflict prevention.\r\nThe emphasis must be on doing more in a collective, \r\ntimely and effective manner. That can be achieved \r\nonly by a strong, robust, adaptable, knowledgeable \r\nand responsible United Nations, which is why Slovenia \r\nstrongly supports the Secretary-General’s reform \r\nefforts. The various parts of the United Nations \r\nsystem must be better coordinated. Duplication must \r\nbe avoided, and the common goal must be getting \r\ntangible results. I would like to conclude by assuring \r\nthe Assembly that Slovenia is committed to supporting \r\nthe United Nations and is determined to work with all \r\npartners to deliver tangible, meaningful results that \r\nwill advance peace, security, development and human \r\nrights for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Slovenia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Miroslav Cerar, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Slovenia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Sigmar Gabriel, Vice-Chancellor \r\nand Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Germany.\r\nMr. Gabriel (Germany) (spoke in German; \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): We seem to \r\nbe going through a phase in which we are confronted \r\nwith hurricanes and earthquakes, both political and \r\nnatural, upheavals that are getting harsher and more \r\nintransigent and belligerent from day to day and from \r\nspeech to speech. As responsible politicians, it is \r\nvital that we ask ourselves how we can bring about a \r\nchange in direction that will lead to more peace and \r\nstability, less hunger and better prospects for everyone \r\nin the world.\r\nHow do we ensure that globalization will ultimately \r\ndeliver justice for all rather than riches to the few? \r\nOne answer as to how we can achieve that change in \r\ndirection can be found in a report addressed to the \r\nSecretary-General of the United Nations. It states that \r\nwe must not limit ourselves to the “traditional questions \r\nof peace and war” but must also work to overcome \r\n“world hunger, mass misery and alarming disparities \r\nbetween the living conditions of rich and poor”. I \r\nfind the analysis very apt. The painful thing about \r\nthat excerpt is that it comes not from a recent report \r\nto the Secretary-General but from one that goes back \r\nnearly 40 years. Its apt analysis of the global situation \r\ncan be found in North-South: A Program for Survival, \r\ncommissioned almost 40 years ago to the day, the report \r\nof the North-South Commission, which began its work \r\nin 1977. The Chairman of the Commission was former \r\nGerman Chancellor Willy Brandt.\r\nHumankind is still dealing with more or less the \r\nsame structural difficulties today, but it seems to have \r\nbecome rather more difficult to change the world for \r\nthe better. Looking around the globe today, it seems \r\nthat a world view that puts one’s own national interests \r\nfirst and which refuses to engage in a balancing of \r\ninterests among the nations of the world is gaining ever \r\nmore ground. National egotism, I believe, is worthless \r\nas an organizing principle for our world of the twenty-\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 21/33\r\nfirst century. Such egotism sees the world as an arena, \r\na battleground in which everyone is fighting against \r\neveryone else and in which everyone has to assert his \r\nor her own interests, either alone or in alliances of \r\nconvenience. In this world view, it is the law of the \r\nstrongest that prevails, not the strength of international \r\nlaw. I firmly believe that we have to rise up against this \r\nworld view. We need more international cooperation \r\nand less national egotism, not the other way around.\r\nSome 40 years ago, the North-South Commission \r\nrecognized that global problems cannot be resolved \r\nthrough confrontation but only through often arduous \r\nefforts to compromise and identify common interests. \r\nUltimately, no country can win if it strives only to assert \r\nits own interests. If we all did that, looking out only for \r\nour own national interests, confrontations and conflicts \r\nwould increase and global prosperity would falter. The \r\nmotto “Our country first” would not only lead to more \r\nnational confrontations and less prosperity; in the end, \r\nwe would all be the losers. As Germans, our historical \r\nexperience is quite unusual. Only after two terrible \r\nworld wars did we learn to see our former enemies as \r\nneighbours and partners with whom we wanted to share \r\nand shoulder responsibility for a peaceful coexistence. \r\nOnly since then have our own citizens in Germany had \r\na better life. We have learned that it was not “Germany \r\nfirst” that made our country strong and prosperous; \r\nrather, it was “European and international responsibility \r\nfirst” that gave us Germans peace and prosperity.\r\nIn international cooperation, no one loses \r\nsovereignty. Rather, we all gain a new sovereignty \r\ntogether that we cannot possess as nation States on our \r\nown in today’s world. That is why the European Union \r\ntoday provides the framework for our German policies. \r\nThe road has often been rocky and arduous, for nothing \r\nis more difficult than turning former enemies into \r\nfriends. Often the way is not popular, and one needs \r\nconsiderable political courage to take it. Indeed, the \r\ncall for international cooperation and for efforts to \r\nbalance interests is not always popular in our own \r\ncountries. However, that courage finally led to peace \r\nand prosperity in Europe after centuries of war. Today \r\nwe Germans are grateful to the courageous people in \r\nFrance, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy and many other \r\ncountries of Europe for having the courage to befriend \r\nus — their former enemies — as new and lasting \r\npartners after the Second World War. It is precisely \r\nbecause of that experience in Germany and Europe that \r\nwe support the work of strong, functioning collective \r\ninstitutions, above all the United Nations.\r\nThe urgent need for us to work together to establish \r\na safer world has been vividly demonstrated by North \r\nKorea’s current irresponsible actions, which pose a \r\nserious threat to world peace. We must send a clear \r\nmessage that the international community will not \r\naccept its nuclear provocations. Germany welcomes \r\nthe sanctions adopted by the Security Council and \r\ncalls for their speedy implementation in Europe, \r\nand we also support European initiatives calling for \r\nadditional measures. At the same time, we should \r\nuse all the diplomatic means at our disposal, first to \r\ndefuse the situation and then to find a starting point \r\nfor long-term solutions. Resolving this international \r\ncrisis is crucial because if we do not, others will be \r\nencouraged to emulate North Korea. If a country can \r\nbuild up a nuclear arsenal while the international \r\ncommunity stands helplessly by, other political leaders \r\nand countries will follow its example. That would bring \r\nabout new nuclear crises emerging all over the world, \r\nand our children and grandchildren would grow up in \r\na very dangerous world. That is why North Korea’s \r\nacquisition of nuclear weapons is neither a bilateral nor \r\na regional problem, but rather a global challenge that \r\nwe have to overcome together.\r\nWe cannot accept the possibility that efforts \r\nto build a nuclear arsenal can be rewarded on the \r\ninternational stage. It is therefore more important than \r\never that the international architecture for arms control \r\nand disarmament does not crumble. Existing treaties \r\nand agreements must not be called into question. That \r\napplies in particular to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\nAction (JCPOA) for Iran’s nuclear programme. The Plan \r\nis a way out of the impasse of a nuclear confrontation \r\nthat would jeopardize security in the region and have \r\nan impact far beyond it. However, we can reach the \r\nlevel of confidence that we so urgently need only if \r\nall obligations are rigorously met and the transparency \r\nwe have agreed on is established. Germany will work \r\nwithin the E3+3 framework to ensure that the JCPOA is \r\nstrictly implemented and upheld. That is not just about \r\nIran; it is about the credibility of the entire international \r\ncommunity. For what State would renounce the \r\ndevelopment of its own nuclear programme if it were \r\nshown that negotiated agreements did not last and that \r\na binding agreement with the international community \r\nwas not worth the paper it was written on? How can \r\nwe convince countries such as North Korea that \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n22/33 17-29585\r\ninternational agreements make them more secure and \r\nwill therefore encourage them to commit to further \r\ndisarmament efforts if the agreement with Iran, the \r\nsole international example of such an endeavour, is \r\nnot upheld?\r\nWhat the world needs most urgently now is renewed \r\ntrust. With particular regard to the implementation of \r\nthe ban on the proliferation of nuclear weapons, we \r\nhave a request for the United States, Russia, China \r\nand every country possessing nuclear weapons. They \r\nwill be instrumental to ensuring the implementation of \r\nthe non-proliferation of nuclear weapons and of arms \r\ncontrol and disarmament. To that end, trust among \r\nthem must be restored.\r\nStatements by Presidents of the United States are \r\nalways important and interesting, and always worth \r\nlistening to and even reading after they have been \r\ndelivered. I found a passage in one such statement that \r\nI especially liked. In it, the President of the United \r\nStates of America called for general and complete \r\ndisarmament. Every year, he said, billions of dollars \r\nwere spent on weapons that were acquired for the \r\npurpose of making sure we never need to use them. \r\nThat, he went on to say, was clearly not the most \r\nefficient means of ensuring peace. I have to admit that \r\nthe statement dates back even further than the report of \r\nthe North-South Commission. It was delivered by John \r\nF. Kennedy in 1963. We can see that everything that \r\nwe need for a safer future has already been considered, \r\nwritten and said. I believe that today we should focus \r\non the bold visions of the North-South Commission and \r\nPresident Kennedy, and have the courage to come up \r\nwith new proposals for disarmament, arms control and \r\nconfidence-building.\r\nOne of our tasks is to resolve emerging crises early \r\non. A recent example is the escalating violence against \r\nthe Rohingya people and the resulting refugee f lows in \r\nthe region. We should act as quickly as possible on the \r\nissue to offer both political and humanitarian support \r\nfor alleviating the suffering and ending the conflict. \r\nGermany will again increase its aid to the Rohingya \r\nthrough the International Red Cross. We are committed \r\nto providing political and humanitarian support, as well \r\nas to practical peacebuilding, in many crisis regions \r\naround the world. And while military engagement under \r\nUnited Nations auspices is also sometimes necessary, \r\nwe must ensure that we do not create any imbalances \r\nin that regard.\r\nTo bring up the North-South Commission again, \r\nits report included the impressive finding that, at the \r\ntime it appeared, a half-day of the world’s military \r\nexpenditure would have sufficed to finance the entire \r\nmalaria eradication programme. I suspect that today \r\nwe would not even need that much. The world’s current \r\nannual spending on weapons is just under $1.7 trillion. \r\nTo achieve Sustainable Development Goal 1 and \r\nthereby eradicate extreme poverty in the world by 2030, \r\nwe would need only 10 per cent of that. Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 4, on education, would require even \r\nless per year. With that in mind, Germany has tripled \r\nits funding for civilian peacebuilding measures in the \r\npast few years.\r\nThankfully, progress has been made in some areas, \r\nfor example in Iraq. We must work fast to consolidate \r\nthe successes achieved there in combating the so-\r\ncalled Islamic State by initiating reconstruction and \r\nstabilization measures in the cities and regions that \r\nhave been liberated. Germany has therefore decided \r\nto make an additional €250 million available for the \r\nreconstruction of Mosul. We cannot abandon the victims \r\nof the thugs of the Islamic State. We must help them \r\nreturn to their country. It is also important to strengthen \r\na democratic and inclusive Iraqi State and ensure that \r\nthe actions of an individual region do not leave it \r\nexposed to a relapse into destabilization or civil war. \r\nWe can only ask the Kurdistan Regional Government \r\nin northern Iraq not to trigger any new conflicts, which \r\nare the very last thing that the country needs.\r\nWe also have to make progress in the Ukraine \r\nconflict. The Minsk agreements, which Germany \r\nplayed a key role in drafting, provide a clear road \r\nmap for peace, based on the principles of the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and the inviolability of borders. \r\nIf proposals are now put forward for deploying a United \r\nNations peacekeeping mission involving Blue Helmets, \r\nI think we should pursue that idea resolutely. While \r\nthere is certainly not yet sufficient consensus on what \r\nsuch a mission should look like, the idea is worth testing \r\nif it can help achieve a ceasefire and the withdrawal of \r\nheavy weapons from the conflict zone. We would like \r\nto ask the Secretary-General to press for the proposal \r\nto be realized.\r\nThe North-South Commission pointed out that \r\nfocusing solely on questions of war and peace was not \r\nenough. Those issues are also inextricably linked to \r\nthe fair distribution of resources and to economic and \r\nsocial development and respect for universal human \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 23/33\r\nrights. Only a world in which solidarity prevails will \r\nultimately bring us security and stability. The 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development shows that the \r\ninternational community sees that as a common interest. \r\nIf we want to make a reality of major ambitions such \r\nas peace, security and justice, we need stronger joint \r\ninternational institutions, and especially a stronger \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe founders of the United Nations were not naive. \r\nThey had experienced the horrors of the first half \r\nof the twentieth century. For that very reason, they \r\nbequeathed to us the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nwith its timeless principles and maxims. But while \r\nthe principles of the United Nations are not outdated, \r\nthe Organization has to adapt to the challenges of our \r\ntimes. We therefore support the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts to push ahead with bold reforms within the \r\nUnited Nations. He is setting the right priorities. The \r\nsuccess of United Nations reform is largely up to \r\nus, the Member States. We have to work together to \r\nensure that the United Nations is more efficient and \r\nhas greater clout. In my view, reform efforts should \r\nnot focus primarily on budget cuts. On the contrary, \r\nthe United Nations will need more resources if it is to \r\nfulfil its mandate. We must therefore provide it with the \r\nmeans it needs to be successful. However, at present \r\nthe figures tell a different story. The World Food \r\nProgramme currently receives less than 50 per cent of \r\nthe funding it needs to combat hunger crises around \r\nthe world. Today a mere 15 per cent of contributions \r\nto the United Nations Development Programme are \r\nvoluntary, non-tied payments, although in 2011 they \r\nwere still at 50 per cent. The same is true for other \r\nUnited Nations aid programmes, and sometimes the \r\noutlook is even bleaker.\r\nIt should not be the job of those in positions of \r\nresponsibility at the United Nations to spend more time \r\nsending begging letters seeking the necessary funding \r\nthan in organizing effective assistance. We must change \r\ncourse and grant the United Nations more freedom \r\nwith resources in exchange for greater transparency \r\nin its use of funds. Germany at any rate intends to \r\nmaintain its financial support for the United Nations. \r\nAs the country that is the fourth-largest provider of \r\nassessed contributions to the United Nations and that \r\ngoes far beyond that, being one of the biggest donors \r\nof global humanitarian assistance generally, our input \r\nis substantial.\r\nI believe that as Member States we should now take \r\non another reform project that is long overdue. That is \r\nthe composition of the Security Council, which should \r\nfinally reflect the realities of the twenty-first-century \r\nworld. Today many more States than at the time of the \r\nestablishment of the United Nations, more than 70 years \r\nago, are shouldering the responsibility for peace and \r\nsecurity and are prepared to live up to that responsibility \r\nas Members of the Organization. Germany is ready and \r\nwilling to take on additional responsibilities, which is \r\nwhy we are seeking a non-permanent seat on the Council \r\nfor the 2019-2020 term. We have clear goals in mind. \r\nPeace and security, global justice and human rights are \r\nindivisibly linked. We are preparing for reform of the \r\nUnited Nations and its Security Council, and we intend \r\nto work in partnership with all countries of the United \r\nNations in Africa, Asia, the Americas and Europe, for \r\nwe can resolve global problems only if we refrain from \r\nfocusing solely on national interests and instead work \r\nto reach a fair and peaceful balance of interests among \r\nall nations. Yes, that is an arduous process. But we must \r\nmuster the courage to go down that path. For as Willy \r\nBrandt, who headed the North-South Commission after \r\nhe left office as Chancellor, once said, “We firmly \r\nbelieve that problems created by men can also be solved \r\nby men”. Let us work on that together.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Sergey Lavrov, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Russian Federation.\r\nMr. Lavrov (Russian Federation) (spoke in \r\nRussian): In December of last year, the General \r\nAssembly adopted resolution 71/190, on the promotion \r\nof a democratic and equitable international order, which \r\nclearly stipulated the inadmissibility of interference in \r\nthe internal affairs of States and of coups d’état as a \r\nmethod of transferring power, and the importance of \r\nexcluding from international relations certain States’ \r\nefforts to exert unlawful pressure on others, including \r\nthrough the extraterritorial application of national \r\njurisdictions. An overwhelming majority of Member \r\nStates voted in favour of the resolution. The minority \r\nwas chiefly represented by the very countries that, \r\ncontrary to the purposes and principles of the United \r\nNations Charter, are attempting to dominate world \r\naffairs and impose their own development models and \r\nvalues on other States and peoples, led by a one-sided \r\nlogic that undermines international law.\r\nBut the world is not standing still. We were \r\npleased that United States President Donald Trump \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n24/33 17-29585\r\nunequivocally stated from this rostrum the day before \r\nyesterday (see A/72/PV.3) that it is important to comply \r\nwith the principles of sovereignty in international \r\naffairs and to lead by example rather than by imposing \r\none’s will on other nations, and that countries with \r\ndifferent values, cultures and aspirations can not only \r\ncoexist but can work side by side on a basis of mutual \r\nrespect. I believe that we can all subscribe to those \r\nwords, especially if United States foreign policy will in \r\nfact be conducted on that basis.\r\nRussia has always abided by the principles of \r\nsovereignty, non-interference in the affairs of other \r\nStates, the equality of peoples and mutual respect in \r\nits international dealings, and it will continue to uphold \r\nthem. In the past quarter century, despite challenges, \r\nour country has taken on in good faith its share of the \r\nwork of eliminating the legacy of the Cold War and \r\nhas done much to strengthen trust and understanding \r\nin Europe, the Atlantic region and all over the world. \r\nHowever, that has not been reciprocated by our Western \r\npartners, intoxicated as they were by the illusion of the \r\nonset of the end of history, and who are still trying to \r\nadapt rudimentary institutions designed for an era of \r\nbloc-versus-bloc confrontation to today’s realities. \r\nNATO wants to recreate the climate of the Cold War \r\nand refuses to implement the principle it solemnly \r\ndeclared in the 1990s — equal and indivisible security \r\nthroughout the region of the Organization for Security \r\nand Cooperation in Europe.\r\nThe West has built its policies according to the \r\nprinciple of “he who is not with us is against us”, \r\nand has proceeded with the heedless expansion of \r\nNATO eastwards, fomenting instability in post-Soviet \r\ngeopolitics and inciting anti-Russian feeling. It is that \r\npolicy that lies at the root of the protracted conflict in \r\nUkraine. Despite the efforts of the Normandy format \r\nand the Trilateral Contact Group, the authorities in \r\nKyiv constantly come up with new ploys to interfere \r\nwith the implementation of their commitments under \r\nthe package of measures outlined in the Minsk \r\nagreements of 12 February 2015 and endorsed by the \r\nSecurity Council.\r\nBut even in those circumstances, Russia has been \r\nfocused on constructive effort and on finding mutually \r\nacceptable ways to implement the Minsk agreements. In \r\nresponse to concerns that have been expressed about the \r\ncurrent security situation, President Putin has launched \r\nan initiative to establish a United Nations mission to \r\nprotect the OSCE observers in the Donbas region, and \r\na corresponding draft resolution has been introduced \r\nin the Security Council. We believe Russia’s proposal \r\nwill help to facilitate a settlement of the internal crisis \r\nin Ukraine that resulted from the anti-constitutional \r\ncoup led by ultra-radicals. We hope for constructive \r\ninteraction on the issues with our European and United \r\nStates partners, without zero-sum games.\r\nHere at United Nations Headquarters, we should \r\nbear in mind how the United Nations began. The \r\ndecisions of the Nuremberg Tribunal were a warning \r\nagainst forgetting the lessons of the Second World War \r\nand the disastrous consequences of attempts to take \r\ncontrol of the world’s destiny by trampling on the lawful \r\ninterests of other nations and peoples. It is disgusting \r\nto use concerns about freedom of expression as a \r\npretext for condoning radical movements that preach \r\nneo-Nazi ideology and support the glorification of \r\nNazis and their associates. We need constant vigilance \r\nto maintain a secure shield against neo-Nazism, \r\nrevanchism, extremism and xenophobia and strengthen \r\ninternational and intercultural harmony.\r\nInciting hatred and intolerance, terrorists, \r\nextremists and nationalists destroy and desecrate objects \r\nof historical, religious and cultural value. Civilized \r\nEurope tolerates the demolition of monuments to the \r\nliberators of the continent and heroes of the Second \r\nWorld War whose victory was the foundation for the \r\nUnited Nations. We think this issue should be a priority \r\nfor immediate attention from the General Assembly and \r\nUNESCO with a view to establishing a legal framework \r\nto prevent such actions, and Russia intends to submit \r\nproposals for it. The continuing indifference to the \r\nshameful issue of statelessness that persists in Europe \r\nis also unacceptable, as is the suppression of minority \r\nlanguages, which is a gross violation of Council of \r\nEurope conventions.\r\nHistory has shown us throughout the ages that \r\narriving at lasting settlements to disputes is possible \r\nonly through dialogue and finding a balance between \r\nthe conflicting parties’ core interests. Unfortunately, \r\noutright pressure is replacing diplomacy increasingly \r\noften in the arsenals of a number of Western countries. \r\nImposing unilateral sanctions on top of those authorized \r\nby the Security Council is an illegitimate act that \r\nundermines the collective international effort. Today we \r\nhave all been watching with alarm as the United States \r\nhas imposed yet another set of restrictions — in fact, \r\nextraterritorial restrictions — on Iran, and threatening \r\nthe implementation of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 25/33\r\nAction, which has become a key factor in international \r\nand regional stability. The United States embargo on \r\nCuba, which has gone on for more than half a century, is \r\na demonstration of the uselessness of policies involving \r\nunilateral sanctions, and almost every Member State \r\nhas been calling for it to be lifted for decades. It is time \r\nto listen to them.\r\nThe spiralling confrontation around the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea is unraveling dangerously. \r\nWe firmly condemn Pyongyang’s adventurist nuclear-\r\nmissile manoeuvres, which violate Security Council \r\nresolutions. But whipping up military hysteria is not \r\nonly a blind alley, it is a deadly one. It goes without \r\nsaying that all Security Council resolutions must \r\nbe implemented but, along with sanctions, they all \r\ninclude provisions on the importance of resuming \r\ntalks. We must stop blocking those provisions. There \r\nis no alternative to the political and diplomatic route, \r\nbased on a dialogue among all interested parties, for \r\naddressing the Korean peninsula’s nuclear problem. \r\nWe urge all responsible members of the international \r\ncommunity to support the Russian-Chinese road map, \r\nas outlined by the Foreign Ministries of Russia and \r\nChina in a joint statement on 4 July.\r\nIncitement to disorder and threats of violent \r\nintervention in the cause of the democratization of \r\nVenezuela are unacceptable, as is any action aimed at \r\nundermining the legitimate Government of any country. \r\nIn any internal conflict, the international community \r\nmust encourage the parties to take the path of national \r\nreconciliation and compromise. Efforts to ignore the \r\nopinions of others and resort to decrees and ultimatums, \r\nor to use force to circumvent the Charter of United \r\nNations, have never done any good. The explosion of \r\ninternational terrorism, the millions of refugees and \r\nunprecedented waves of illegal migration are to a large \r\ndegree the result of the attempts of the past few years \r\nto achieve regime change, including through the armed \r\ninterventions that have wreaked havoc and destruction \r\nin the Middle East and North Africa and have paved the \r\nway for terrorists in parts of the world where they had \r\nnever appeared before.\r\nDespite the fact that the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Levant (ISIL) is pulling back in Syria and \r\nIraq, considerable additional effort will be needed \r\nto stabilize the region. We should recall that we are \r\nfighting Al-Nusra as well as ISIL, despite the fact \r\nthat for some reason Al-Nusra is tolerated by United \r\nStates coalition members. Recent developments in \r\nSyria have given grounds for cautious optimism. The \r\nsixth international meeting on Syria, held in Astana \r\non 14 and 15 September, finalized the establishment \r\nof the four de-escalation zones, which had been agreed \r\non with the participation of Russia, Iran, Turkey, the \r\nUnited States, Jordan and the United Nations, with \r\nthe support of many other countries. The agreements \r\ncreate the conditions for further progress towards \r\nimplementing Security Council resolution 2254 (2015) \r\non the basis of direct dialogue between the Government \r\nand the opposition aimed at uniting their efforts to \r\neliminate the terrorist epicentre as soon as possible and \r\nrestoring peace and unity throughout the country, while \r\nresolving its acute humanitarian problems. The most \r\nurgent task is to increase the supplies of humanitarian \r\naid and demining the liberated territories. We believe \r\nfirmly that anyone who sincerely desires peace for Syria \r\nand its people should take part in this process under \r\nthe leadership of the United Nations and without any \r\npreconditions. The incidents where chemical weapons \r\nhave been used in the region are a separate issue. Every \r\ncase should be investigated honestly and professionally, \r\nwith no attempts to manipulate the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons-United Nations Joint \r\nInvestigative Mechanism.\r\nFinding solutions to humanitarian issues and \r\nreconciling conflicting parties are also relevant issues \r\nfor other crises in the region, including the situations \r\nin Libya, Yemen and Iraq. In all of those situations, \r\nas with any conflict, Russia is pursuing a balanced \r\npolicy and working with all parties without exception. \r\nWith regard to issues in the Middle East and North \r\nAfrica, we cannot put United Nations decisions on the \r\nPalestinian question and the Arab Peace Initiative on \r\nthe backburner, much less consign them to oblivion. \r\nWe believe that restoring Palestinian unity is crucial \r\nand welcome Egypt’s efforts in that direction. Russia \r\nis ready to assist in every possible way with the \r\nresumption of direct talks between Israel and Palestine, \r\nand to cooperate with its partners in the Quartet and the \r\nArab League of States for that purpose. As long as the \r\nPalestinian question goes unresolved, it will continue \r\nto be exploited by extremists, who are attracting ever \r\nmore new recruits.\r\nThe never-ending bloody terrorist attacks around \r\nthe world illustrate the illusory nature of efforts to create \r\nisolated safe havens. We can combat extremism and \r\nterrorism together, without double standards or hidden \r\nagendas, only based on the primary responsibility \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n26/33 17-29585\r\nof States, as envisaged in the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy. We welcome the reform \r\nof United Nations counter-terrorism activities that the \r\nSecretary-General has initiated, which the General \r\nAssembly has endorsed. We see the appointment of \r\na Russian to head the new United Nations Office of \r\nCounter-Terrorism as an acknowledgement of the role \r\nthat Russia has played in combating this evil, and we \r\nthank everyone for their support.\r\nRussia is committed to the goal of achieving \r\na nuclear-weapon-free world. Under the existing \r\ntreaty regimes in the area of arms control and \r\nnon-proliferation, the complete elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons should be the end result of a process of \r\nuniversal and total disarmament that continues to \r\nensure equal and indivisible security. Attempts to \r\noutlaw nuclear weapons that ignore current realities and \r\nall the factors that can affect strategic stability serve \r\nonly to make this common goal further off than ever \r\nand to undermine the consensus regimes of the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nWe urge everyone to say no to the militarization of \r\nthe information space. We must work to stop it becoming \r\nan arena for political and military confrontation and \r\nprevent the use of information and communications \r\ntechnologies as instruments for exerting pressure, \r\ninflicting economic damage and spreading terrorist \r\nand extremist propaganda. The United Nations should \r\nfocus its efforts on formulating rules for responsible \r\nbehaviour in the digital sphere that can meet the \r\nsecurity interests of all States. Russia has drafted \r\na universal convention on countering cybercrime, \r\nincluding hacking, and we hope to launch discussions \r\non it during the current session.\r\nIt is clear that in future the world will continue to \r\nconfront a whole range of new, long-term problems \r\naffecting our entire civilization. We have no right to \r\nwaste our energy, time and efforts on geopolitical \r\ngames. We need collective approaches, not unilateral \r\nones. The process of shaping a polycentric world \r\norder is also a trend — a changing event that reflects \r\nthe redistribution of the global balance of power and \r\nthe increasing role that the cultural and civilizational \r\nidentity of peoples plays in it. All of us, including those \r\nwho are used to telling the world what to do, will have \r\nto adapt to it. It is in our common interests not to try to \r\nrestrain this natural process. We will have to work to \r\nensure that the world order becomes fair and democratic, \r\njust as the founding fathers of the United Nations \r\nenvisioned. Globalization should unite rather than \r\ndivide people, while taking account of the interests of \r\nall States without exception and contributing to a stable \r\nand secure future for all humankind. Without mutual \r\ntrust, we cannot hope for the effective implementation \r\nof the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals or the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change, or for solutions to \r\nglobal issues that are so crucial to developing countries, \r\nsuch as food security, demographics and health care.\r\nThe fundamental principles of international \r\nrelations should include the recognition of political \r\npluralism, freedom of choice and the rule of law. We \r\nmust stop relying on military alliances and instead \r\nprovide support and security guarantees to States that \r\nopt for neutrality. On the economic front, we must \r\nwork to lower barriers to trade and investment and \r\nstop politicizing economic relations. The International \r\nOlympic Movement, and sports in general, should \r\nremain outside politics. First and foremost, we must \r\nfoster in young people respect for the cultural and \r\ncivilizational diversity of today’s world. We invite \r\neverybody to the nineteenth World Festival of Youth \r\nand Students, which my country will host in Sochi \r\nless than a month from now. Another important event \r\nwill take place in Russia at the same time, when St. \r\nPetersburg convenes the 137th Inter-Parliamentary \r\nUnion Assembly, at which the main topic for discussion \r\nwill be “Promoting cultural pluralism and peace through \r\ninterfaith and inter-ethnic dialogue”. Let us encourage \r\ndialogue among various cultures and religions and stop \r\nusing historical events to foment hatred and fear.\r\nA philosophy of coexistence, unity and \r\nharmonization of countries’ different interests \r\nunderlies President Vladimir Putin’s proposal for a \r\ngreater Eurasian partnership, open to all States of Asia \r\nand Europe, with the goal of creating an economic \r\nand humanitarian space based on the principle of the \r\nindivisibility of security. It goes without saying that \r\nequal rights for all, individuals and States, would be a \r\nuniversal requirement, as stated in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Those just and equitable principles form \r\nthe foundation for the activities of various organizations \r\nin which Russia actively participates, including the \r\nCommonwealth of Independent States, the Collective \r\nSecurity Treaty Organization, the Eurasian Economic \r\nUnion, the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and \r\nthe BRICS group of Brazil, Russia, India, China and \r\nSouth Africa. We also continue to build relations \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 27/33\r\nwith the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the \r\nAfrican Union, the Community of Latin American \r\nand Caribbean States and other associations of Asian, \r\nAfrican and Latin American countries. Through \r\nour joint efforts we have achieved a more balanced \r\napproach in the work of organizations such as the \r\nGroup of 20, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation, \r\nthe International Monetary Fund and the International \r\nBank for Reconstruction and Development.\r\nWe believe in the vitality of this Organization and \r\nwould like the Secretary-General to play an active \r\nrole in facilitating the full realization of its potential \r\nbased on the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, while respecting the prerogatives \r\nof its intergovernmental bodies. Peacekeeping reform \r\nin particular requires a carefully tailored approach, \r\nwithout abrupt shifts or abandoning decades of \r\ninvaluable accumulated experience.\r\nTwo thousand years ago, the Roman philosopher \r\nSeneca wrote, “We are born to live together”. The \r\nfounding fathers of the United Nations understood that \r\nbetter than anyone. They believed — and enshrined in \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations — that our God-given \r\nexistence on a single planet should compel all of us to \r\nunite in order to prevent the scourge of new wars. If we \r\nare to do that today, we badly need to revive the culture \r\nof diplomacy and dialogue and the quest for a balance \r\nof our interests, rather than making rash, instinctive \r\ndecisions in our desire to punish those who disobey us. \r\nWhat this is really about is preserving humankind in \r\nall its richness and diversity. Russia has always been, \r\nand always will be, open to working together with all \r\nthose who show that they are ready to meet halfway \r\nand cooperate on a basis of equality and mutual respect. \r\nWe will continue to uphold those principles in the work \r\nof the United Nations in the interests of improving \r\nglobal governance and genuinely democratizating \r\ninternational relations.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Wang Yi, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China.\r\nMr. Wang Yi (China) (spoke in Chinese): The \r\ntheme of the General Assembly at this year’s session, \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”, is highly relevant, \r\nespecially for an Organization that has made an \r\nexceptional contribution to peace and development. \r\nThe United Nations has upheld its mission to support \r\nworld peace by setting up a collective security \r\nmechanism, defusing regional hotspots and deploying \r\npeacekeepers. It has been instrumental in preventing \r\nfull-scale wars and securing more than seven decades \r\nof relative peace for humankind. It has pursued its \r\ngoals for development by setting a global development \r\nagenda and mobilizing resources worldwide. The \r\nUnited Nations has helped many developing countries \r\nonto a fast track to development, leading billions of \r\npeople to modernization.\r\nBut since the ideals of the United Nations have not \r\nyet been fully realized, countries must persist in their \r\nefforts. We live in an era defined by deepening trends \r\ntowards a multipolar world, the collective emergence \r\nof emerging markets and developing countries, \r\nsteady progress in globalization and the application \r\nof information technology, and an exciting new \r\nphase in the scientific and technological revolution. \r\nIn humankind’s pursuit of greater development and \r\nprosperity, we see opportunities as never before. We \r\nare also living in a world that is witnessing profound \r\nchanges in the international landscape and the balance \r\nof power. We see major threats, traditional and \r\nnon-traditional, inadequate drivers of global growth \r\nand an increasing backlash against globalization. In our \r\npursuit of lasting peace and sustainable development \r\nwe are encountering unprecedented challenges. We \r\nare once again at a crossroads, so it is time to make \r\nthe right choices between peace and war, openness and \r\nisolation, unity and division.\r\nTwo years ago, from this rostrum, Xi Jinping, \r\nPresident of the People’s Republic of China, called \r\non us to foster a new form of international relations, \r\nbased on win-win cooperation, with a view to building \r\ncommunity and a shared future for humankind (see \r\nA/70/PV.13). President Xi’s vision is a great one, \r\nreflecting his firm grasp of the prevailing trends of \r\nour times. It is also China’s answer to the question \r\nof the kind of future that humankind should build, \r\nand it is fully aligned with the purposes of the United \r\nNations and the aspirations of its Member States. With \r\nthe understanding and support of the international \r\ncommunity, it can inspire us as a common goal.\r\nTo ensure peace, development and dignity for \r\nall, we must embrace the spirit of the United Nations \r\nand move its work forward. The United Nations must \r\ncontinue to be the guardian of world peace, since the \r\nmaintenance of peace and security is one of the core \r\npurposes of the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n28/33 17-29585\r\nthe primary mission of the Organization. The United \r\nNations must encourage its members to live together \r\nin peace, as good neighbours, and to work to achieve \r\nshared, comprehensive, cooperative and sustainable \r\nsecurity. The five permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil must play an exemplary role in rejecting \r\nconflict and confrontation in favour of mutual respect \r\nand win-win cooperation. All Member States should \r\ntreat one another as equals, choosing dialogue over \r\nconfrontation and partnerships over alliances in their \r\nrelations. Credibility and justice must be upheld and \r\nefforts must be made to find common ground, manage \r\ndifferences and work to settle disputes peacefully \r\nand reasonably.\r\nWe need a holistic approach to fighting terrorism. \r\nWe must abide by the rule of law and avoid applying \r\ndouble standards. Terrorism should not be associated \r\nwith any particular ethnic group or religion, and the \r\nUnited Nations should lead and coordinate efforts to \r\nbuild a global united front against it. Political solutions \r\nare the fundamental answer to hotspot issues. The \r\nparties to any conflict must stay committed to dialogue \r\nand negotiation, and the international community \r\nshould work objectively and impartially to facilitate \r\ndialogue and promote peace, rather than stirring \r\nup trouble and making things more difficult. The \r\nUnited Nations should serve as the main channel for \r\nconflict prevention, make full use of Chapter VI of \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and step up political \r\nmediation efforts.\r\nWe are seeing some light on the horizon for a \r\npolitical settlement of the Syrian crisis. We should make \r\ngood use of the Geneva and Astana channels and exert \r\ngreater pressure for direct substantive talks between \r\nthe Syrian Government and opposition. Alongside the \r\ntalks, efforts must be made to achieve a cessation of \r\nhostilities, increase humanitarian assistance and launch \r\npost-war reconstruction in order to give people greater \r\nfaith in peace talks.\r\nThe Palestinian question has been bogged down \r\non the United Nations agenda for 70 years, and the \r\ninternational community owes the Palestinians a long-\r\noverdue and just solution. All settlement activities in the \r\noccupied territories and all violence against civilians \r\nmust end immediately. Concerted efforts should be \r\nmade to advance a political resolution based on a two-\r\nState solution and to restart the peace talks as soon as \r\npossible. We must think out of the box with a view to \r\nfacilitating peace through development and helping the \r\npeople of the region to lay the groundwork for peace.\r\nThe situation on the Korean peninsula is now a \r\nfocus of international attention. Two days ago, on \r\n19 September, we marked the twelfth anniversary of the \r\n2005 joint statement of the Six-Party Talks. At the time, \r\nthe six parties — China, as Chair, the United States, \r\nRussia, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nthe Republic of Korea and Japan — made concerted \r\nefforts, and the United States and the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, the two major parties \r\ninvolved, made political decisions. We formulated a \r\nroad map for the denuclearization of the peninsula. The \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea undertook to \r\nabandon its nuclear programmes, and the United States \r\nto normalize its relations with the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. All the parties committed to setting \r\nup a permanent peace mechanism for the peninsula. \r\nThe joint statement opened new vistas for regional \r\npeace and stability and inspired hope for a peaceful \r\nsettlement to the dispute.\r\nTwelve years have passed. Some may think that \r\nthe situation on the peninsula has changed and that the \r\njoint statement has become outdated, but we believe \r\nthat things that follow progressive trends of the times \r\nare never outdated, and that decisions on the right side \r\nof history never become obsolete. If there has been \r\nany change, and if there is anything we need now, it \r\nis still denuclearization, but denuclearization that is \r\nmore comprehensive, thorough and irreversible. There \r\nshould be no new nuclear-weapon State, whether in the \r\nnorth or south of the peninsula, in North-East Asia or \r\nanywhere else in the world. We urge the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea not to continue along this \r\ndangerous path. We call on the United States to honour \r\nits formal commitment and on all the parties to play a \r\nconstructive role in easing tensions. There is still hope \r\nfor peace, and we must not give up. Negotiation is the \r\nonly way out and deserves every effort. The parties \r\nshould meet halfway by addressing one another’s \r\nlegitimate concerns. In China’s view, the day when the \r\ndenuclearization of the peninsula is achieved should \r\nalso be the day when a peace mechanism is established. \r\nChina has always been a force for peace. We have \r\nworked tirelessly for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear \r\nissue on the peninsula. Whatever changes happen, \r\nhowever long it takes and whatever the difficulties \r\nwe may face, China will stay firmly committed to \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 29/33\r\nthe denuclearization of the peninsula, to dialogue and \r\nnegotiations and to regional peace and stability.\r\nThe United Nations must remain a champion of \r\ninternational development. The implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development should be its \r\ntop priority in the field of development. It is important \r\nto encourage Member States to seek complementarity \r\nbetween the Agenda and their own development \r\nstrategies, to eliminate hunger and poverty and to leave \r\nno one behind. We must ensure equitable, inclusive and \r\nquality education and lifelong learning opportunities \r\nfor all. We should enhance the role of North-South \r\ncooperation as the main channel for international \r\ndevelopment and cooperation, while leveraging South-\r\nSouth and tripartite cooperation. Climate change \r\nis a major factor to consider where the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of humankind is concerned. It will be \r\ncrucial to ensure that the United Nations continues \r\nto work on the follow-up to the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change and to urge all parties to uphold the \r\nprinciples of common but differentiated responsibilities, \r\nequitability, and respective capabilities, and to reinforce \r\ninternational cooperation on climate issues.\r\nThe problem of refugees is a result of regional \r\ninstability and uneven development. The United \r\nNations must respond to crises promptly through its \r\nhumanitarian efforts. We must work to address the \r\nroot causes of such problems by helping countries and \r\nregions to achieve development. Restoring the global \r\neconomy to full recovery and growth continues to be \r\nan uphill task. The United Nations should promote the \r\nfacilitation of liberalized trade and investment and \r\nwork to build an open world economy. We must seize \r\nthe opportunities that the newest phase of the scientific \r\nrevolution presents, stay committed to reform, pursue \r\ninnovation-driven development, find new spaces for \r\ndevelopment and foster a new development system.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to be a pacesetter \r\nin global governance. As an organization at the core of \r\nthe contemporary international system, it can accurately \r\nreflect the state of affairs in global governance. It \r\nshould therefore follow current trends and work to \r\nmake international relations more democratic, rules-\r\nbased and equitable. Our Organization belongs to all of \r\nits 193 Member States, which are all equal, regardless \r\nof their size and wealth. The United Nations should \r\ntherefore promote a spirit of democracy and ensure \r\nthat all countries enjoy equal rights and opportunities \r\nand follow the same rules in international affairs, \r\nenabling them to set international rules together, \r\nrun global affairs together and share in development \r\nachievements together. At the same time, the United \r\nNations should also constantly improve its institutions \r\nand mechanisms in order to uphold the interests of the \r\nmajority of countries and to keep abreast of the evolving \r\ninternational landscape. It should promote the equal \r\nand uniform application of international law and stress \r\nthe importance of fully and faithfully implementing it. \r\nIt should urge all parties to observe the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, fulfil \r\ntheir responsibilities and obligations and keep the \r\nfoundations of international law and order intact.\r\nGlobalization is an unstoppable trend. It is not a \r\nchoice between East and West. It should not follow the \r\nlaw of the jungle, much less a winner-take-all approach. \r\nThe United Nations should uphold the principle of \r\nextensive consultations, joint contributions and shared \r\nbenefits, and work to make economic globalization \r\nmore open, inclusive, balanced and beneficial to all.\r\nThe United Nations must remain a facilitator of \r\nexchanges among civilizations. It is the diversity of its \r\ncivilizations that gives our global village its vitality. \r\nWe should raise awareness about the importance \r\nof that diversity and be eager to respect, protect and \r\npromote it. Civilizations can complement one another \r\nas they seek common ground and make progress \r\ntogether through exchanges and mutual learning. We \r\nshould encourage our various civilizations, cultures \r\nand countries to f lourish together through interaction \r\nand healthy competition. UNESCO and the Alliance of \r\nCivilizations have a large role to play in that regard. \r\nWe should also encourage and respect the efforts of \r\ncountries to choose development paths that suit their \r\nnational conditions. Countries with different systems \r\nand paths should respect and learn from one another in \r\norder to make progress together. The United Nations \r\nshould serve as a platform for harmonious coexistence \r\nbetween countries with different systems and as a \r\nbridge for dialogue and exchange.\r\nChina’s journey over the past five years has been a \r\nmomentous one. Under the leadership of the eighteenth \r\nCentral Committee of the Communist Party of China, \r\nwith Comrade Xi Jinping at its core, China has made \r\nremarkable achievements on all fronts, and socialism \r\nwith Chinese characteristics has entered a new and \r\nhistoric stage. As we looking to the future, China’s \r\ncontinuous progress will bring to the world greater \r\nbenefits of peace, development and governance. China \r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n30/33 17-29585\r\nis an anchor of world peace. Maintaining the stability \r\nof a country with a population of more than 1.3 billion \r\npeople represents an enormous contribution to world \r\npeace. Aggression has never been in Chinese genes, and \r\nacts of colonization or plunder are nowhere to found in \r\nour history. President Xi has solemnly pledged that no \r\nmatter how advanced China’s development becomes, it \r\nwill never seek hegemony or to expand or extend its \r\nsphere of influence. China will always vote for peace \r\nin the Security Council.\r\nChina is an engine for development and prosperity. \r\nThe Belt and Road Forum for international cooperation \r\nthat China successfully hosted last May has produced \r\nmore than 270 cooperation deliverables. China wants \r\nto make the Belt and Road a road to peace, prosperity, \r\nopenness and innovation that connects different \r\ncivilizations. This project of the century will offer a \r\nnew paradigm for efforts to promote world peace and \r\ndevelopment. It will also inject fresh impetus into the \r\npursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030.\r\nStarting next year, China will host the China \r\nInternational Import Expo, make even greater strides \r\nin its opening up and provide a new driving force for \r\nthe global economy.\r\nChina is a champion of multilateralism. It firmly \r\nupholds the purposes and principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations; the sovereignty, independence and \r\nterritorial integrity of countries; and the centrality of \r\nthe United Nations in international affairs. No matter \r\nhow the international landscape may change, China \r\nwill stay firmly committed to multilateralism and will \r\nshoulder the responsibilities assigned it by the United \r\nNations and will fulfil its due obligations to the world.\r\nThe Communist Party of China will soon convene \r\nits nineteenth national congress. This will be a very \r\nimportant meeting held at a time when China is reaching \r\na decisive stage in the completion of the building of a \r\nmoderately prosperous society in all respects and a key \r\nphase in the development of socialism with Chinese \r\ncharacteristics. It will open a new chapter in the pursuit \r\nof the Chinese dream. China will seek to realize its \r\nown dream in the context of the shared aspirations \r\nof all peoples of the world and continue to contribute \r\nto the development of all other countries through its \r\nown progress. Let us work together for a better future \r\nfor humankind.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish) : I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Luis Videgaray Caso, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the United Mexican States.\r\nMr. Videgaray Caso (Mexico) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nI am addressing the General Assembly today at a \r\ndifficult and painful time for Mexicans. Our nation \r\nhas been battered by Nature. In recent weeks, together \r\nwith our sister nations of the Caribbean and the states \r\nof Florida and Texas, in the United States, we have been \r\nhit by tremendous natural disasters that have resulted \r\nin suffering, destruction and death.\r\nThe worst for Mexico was two consecutive \r\nearthquakes in only 12 days, which have put to the test \r\nnot only our readiness and infrastructure but our very \r\nhumanity. The first earthquake left approximately 100 \r\npeople dead and 300,000 injured in the southern states \r\nof Chiapas and Oaxaca. The second, just 48 hours \r\nago, so far has caused 273 deaths and the destruction \r\nof many houses, schools and bridges. It has left many \r\npeople wounded in Mexico City and in the central part \r\nof Mexico.\r\nIn the face of these natural disasters, today more \r\nthan ever I feel proud to be Mexican. Mexican society, \r\nunited and in a spirit of solidarity, has taken to the \r\nstreets to help and rescue the victims. We are seeing \r\nyoung people rescuing the old, children rescuing \r\ntheir parents, homemakers joining rescue brigades, \r\nneighbours collecting food, people opening their homes \r\nand turning them into shelters, and others forming \r\nhuman chains to clear debris and save the lives of those \r\nwho are still trapped. It is with great hope that we \r\ninform the Assembly that we have been able to pull 51 \r\npeople alive from collapsed buildings, and we hope to \r\nrescue many more.\r\nAt this difficult time, Mexicans are very moved \r\nby the many speedy gestures of solidarity on the part \r\nof the international community. Friends are there at \r\ndifficult times, and we have seen with great emotion \r\nthat Mexico has true friends throughout the world. \r\nTheir timely help can make the difference between life \r\nand death for many. So far, priority has been given to \r\nrescue activities, helping people trapped in the rubble \r\nto be able to see the light of day once again. We are also \r\nproviding immediate medical assistance to those who \r\nneed it urgently, and have joined together to feed and \r\nshelter all those who have lost their homes or are afraid \r\nto return to them.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 31/33\r\nLeading these efforts is a society resolved to move \r\nforward stronger than ever. We have had vital help in \r\nassisting our people from our armed forces and civil \r\nprotection authorities. The rescuers have not rested in \r\nthis task, and yet much remains to be done.\r\nOn behalf of the people and the Government of \r\nMexico, and on behalf of the President of all Mexicans, \r\nEnrique Peña Nieto, let me wholeheartedly express \r\nmy gratitude for the innumerable shows of sympathy \r\nand support that we have received from throughout \r\nthe world. This help shows us that to be in the United \r\nNations following a natural disaster means being \r\namong one’s family. Today Mexico feels embraced and \r\nis relieved to see that the world has not abandoned us \r\nin our tragedy. We would in particular like to thank \r\nSecretary-General António Guterres and the staff of \r\nthe United Nations system that help with emergency \r\nsituations by supporting urgent assistance efforts.\r\nI should like also to thank the many countries \r\nthat mobilized very quickly to send rescue teams and \r\nexperts. This morning in Mexico City we woke up to \r\nthe presence of rescue teams from Honduras and El \r\nSalvador, who were assigned to the Tlalpan area. Rescue \r\nteams from Israel were busy in Álvaro Obregón street; \r\nfrom the United States, in Escocia and Edimburgo \r\nstreets; and from Panama, in Queretaro and Medellín \r\nstreets. Rescue teams have recently arrived from Spain, \r\nand in the next few hours we are expecting teams from \r\nEcuador, Japan, Colombia, Costa Rica and Peru and \r\nmany other nations that have offered help, which we \r\nwill definitely accept and avail ourselves of.\r\nWe give heartfelt thanks to the Governments of \r\nthose countries for their solidarity. The Mexican people \r\nwill not forget it.\r\nThe international solidarity that is on display in \r\nMexico does not mean that we should not talk about \r\nthe challenges facing the world, which can be overcome \r\nsuccessfully only through that same solidarity. One of \r\nthose challenges is the growing lack of confidence in \r\nmultilateralism. In the past decade, the international \r\neconomy experienced the impacts of a severe financial \r\ncrisis in the more developed countries, which led to \r\na sudden rise in unemployment, the loss of savings \r\nand a drop in the net worth of millions of families; \r\nmany companies also went bankrupt. In addition, \r\nthousands of jobs are gradually disappearing owing \r\nto the growing use of robotics in certain industries \r\nand the automatization in the service industry. These \r\nfactors have given rise to a wave of deep fear and social \r\nfrustration, which have led to the rejection of an open \r\nworld and of globalization.\r\nTerrorism has also contributed to increasing fears \r\nof the outside world among the peoples of various \r\nregions. This wave of fear and rejection of globalization \r\nhas reached the United Nations and other international \r\norganizations. Today we hear voices questioning the \r\neffectiveness of multilateralism in dealing with global \r\nchallenges. It would seem today that the community \r\nof sovereign States is dealing with a false dilemma: \r\nto persevere in cooperation and in building bridges of \r\nunderstanding or, on the contrary, to close borders and \r\nbuild walls based on fear. Mexico rejects that dilemma. \r\nMexico has been, is and will remain a sovereign State \r\nwith a deep multilateral vocation. No country, however \r\npowerful, is capable of responding on its own to the \r\nenormous shared challenges of our time.\r\nIt is multilateralism that makes the difference \r\nbetween an international system of States that are \r\nlimited to mutual coexistence and an international \r\nsociety in which sovereign States are committed to a \r\njoint and responsible coexistence for the solution of \r\nthe common challenges. The commitment of States \r\nto multilateralism reduces anarchic tendencies in the \r\ninternational system. A world based on sovereignly \r\naccepted rules and procedures is in everyone’s interest, \r\nbecause multilateralism sets acceptable international \r\nparameters within which sovereign States accept to \r\nmaintain their conduct.\r\nThe achievements of multilateralism in recent \r\nyears are many. The fight against climate change, the \r\npreservation of biodiversity, the regulation of the arms \r\ntrade, the new paradigm of international drug control \r\npolicy and the response to natural disasters are some \r\nexamples of that. Today, Mexico is betting once again \r\non multilateralism in the process of negotiating the \r\nglobal compact for safe, orderly and regular migration.\r\nToday, as Mexico confronts a tragedy, Mexicans \r\nonce again see the value of multilateralism through \r\nthe support provided by the United Nations Office for \r\nthe Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). \r\nWe recognize the value of being part of an authentic \r\ninternational community. In minutes, OCHA helped \r\nus to identify the countries that had the capacities \r\nto support our emergency. In that moment of pain, \r\nmultilateralism and the United Nations showed the \r\nMexicans their most generous and practical face.\r\nA/72/PV.12 21/09/2017\r\n32/33 17-29585\r\nFew instruments call for solidarity among \r\nhuman beings with the power of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. For Mexico, the Agenda is \r\na State commitment. In that regard, we established \r\na national council, headed by the President of the \r\nRepublic, and the Federal Government will prepare \r\nits budget and development plans based on the criteria \r\ncontained in the Agenda. The 2030 Agenda should serve \r\nas a new focal point for the work of our Organization. \r\nWe must channel the energies of the United Nations \r\ntowards effectively seeking the prosperity of the people \r\nof the planet.\r\nMexico will always be in favour of peace and the \r\npeaceful settlement of disputes. Unfortunately, armed \r\nconflicts continue to demand the involvement of the \r\nUnited Nations. That is why Mexico has participated \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping operations since 2014. \r\nThe successful case of the Final Agreement for Ending \r\nthe Conflict and Building a Stable and Lasting Peace is \r\na significant example. However, if the United Nations \r\nis to be more effective in that task, it is necessary to \r\nstrengthen its preventive capacities, focused on the \r\nindividual, the promotion of development and, of \r\ncourse, respect for human rights.\r\nThe existence of nuclear weapons poses a threat to \r\nall humankind. In view of the persistence of the nuclear \r\ndanger, the Government of Mexico signed the Treaty on \r\nthe Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons yesterday, which \r\nthe executive will soon submit to the approval of the \r\nSenate of the Republic. At the same time, Mexico will \r\nsupport all Security Council resolutions against nuclear \r\nthreats, and today we reiterate our full support for the \r\nTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in \r\norder to ensure its effective compliance.\r\nWe unequivocally condemn all terrorist attacks, \r\nregardless of their motivation. That is why we support \r\nthe multilateral initiatives of the United Nations, \r\nwhich, together with the efforts to eradicate terrorism, \r\npromote tolerance and the respect for human rights. \r\nStates have the obligation to protect and promote \r\nhuman rights. However, women and girls suffer sexual \r\nviolence, exclusion, marginalization, discrimination \r\nand, in extreme cases, abominable murders. Mexico \r\nrecognizes its obligation to redouble efforts to combat \r\nthose practices and punish their perpetrators. States \r\nshould be committed in solidarity to the empowerment \r\nof women and girls. Gender equality is a prerequisite \r\nfor a world in which peace and development are truly \r\nsustainable, inclusive and lasting.\r\nMexico reaffirms its openness to the world. We are \r\nexpanding and diversifying our political, economic and \r\ncooperative links with all regions, including Europe, \r\nAsia and the Pacific. Mexico and the Union Europe are \r\nabout to complete the updating of their legal framework, \r\nwhich will have stronger instruments, based on shared \r\nvalues, such as the defence of multilateralism, to better \r\nface the global challenges of today together. In the same \r\nway, we are strengthening our ties with China, Japan \r\nand the Republic of Korea. We have launched trade \r\nnegotiations with Australia, New Zealand, Singapore \r\nand Israel, to mention just a few.\r\nAt the same time, we are determined to deepen \r\nour ties with the region to which we proudly belong, \r\nLatin America and the Caribbean. The natural disaster \r\nthat Mexico experienced proves that solidarity is a \r\ncritical value for the countries of our region. Mexico is \r\nstanding and will continue to stand in solidarity with \r\neach and every one of the nations of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean. We want to stand in solidarity with our \r\nbrothers from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras \r\nin their ongoing efforts to strengthen the security, \r\nstability and prosperity of their societies in the interest \r\nof increasing the safety and prosperity of their peoples. \r\nMexico also wishes to stand in solidarity with our \r\nbrothers of the Caribbean, who are facing a huge \r\nchallenge in their reconstruction. Mexico has been and \r\nwill continue to be present in that effort.\r\nWe want to stand in solidarity with the Venezuelan \r\npeople, who are struggling to recover their democracy. \r\nWe will maintain our solidarity with our partners of \r\nthe Pacific Ocean Alliance — Chile, Colombia and \r\nPeru — in order to continue promoting innovation, \r\ntrade and investment in our countries. We want to \r\nstand in solidarity with members of the Southern \r\nCommon Market — Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and \r\nUruguay — with which the Pacific Ocean Alliance \r\nhas started a promising process of rapprochement. \r\nWe want to be in solidarity with our Cuban brothers, \r\nwho aspire to open up to the world and normalize \r\ntheir relations with all nations. Mexico is also a proud \r\nmember of North America. As a sovereign and solidary \r\nnation, we believe in the process of North American \r\nintegration so that the region can consolidate itself \r\nas the most competitive in the world. Mexico aspires \r\nto and foresees a region where bridges of friendship \r\nand cooperation prevail, along with the principle of \r\nshared responsibility in facing our common problems. \r\nToday, the people and the Government of Mexico \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.12\r\n17-29585 33/33\r\nreiterate from this rostrum their deep solidarity with all \r\nMexicans living in the United States, regardless of their \r\nimmigration status. The Government of Mexico has the \r\nmoral and legal obligation to protect and support them. \r\nThrough our consulates, we will continue to support \r\nthem, defend their rights and advocate for their causes. \r\nWe are deeply proud of them and their contribution \r\nto the North American economy, culture and society. \r\nWe are particularly proud of the “dreamers” and will \r\ncontinue to strive for a permanent solution to their \r\nlegal status.\r\nWith Canada and the United States, we are making \r\nprogress in updating the North American Free Trade \r\nAgreement. We are participating in that process with \r\nabsolute seriousness. Mexico will always defend its \r\nlegitimate national interests in the conviction that it is \r\npossible to achieve a very positive result for all three \r\ncountries. We know that the world is focused on the \r\noutcome of those negotiations. We have an opportunity \r\nto consolidate a more prosperous, more competitive \r\nand more just North America.\r\nIn the present moment of pain, Mexicans see \r\nthe value of a more supportive, efficient, effective, \r\ntransparent and representative United Nations. The \r\nGovernment that I represent supports the proposals \r\nof Secretary-General António Guterres, because they \r\nare aimed at making the United Nations system a more \r\neffective and solidary Organization.\r\nThe message that I bring today is that Mexico will \r\novercome the recent catastrophe and our nation will be \r\nstronger for it. Mexicans are a strong people. The people \r\nand the Government of Mexico are still standing. Today, \r\nMexicans thank the world and the United Nations. We \r\nthank the United Nations agencies for being aware of \r\nus. We thank Governments for their sympathy, support \r\nand extraordinarily valuable help. We thank all for their \r\nsolidarity. We thank the citizens of the world who are \r\nthinking of us today. We thank them for their prayers \r\nand good wishes and for standing with Mexicans, today \r\nand always.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.30 p.m.\r\n"
