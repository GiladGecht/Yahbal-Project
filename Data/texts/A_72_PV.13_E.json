(Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Skinner-Klée \r\n(Guatemala), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.35 p.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of El Salvador.\r\nMr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Salvador \r\nSánchez Cerén, President of the Republic of El Salvador, \r\nand to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Sánchez Cerén (spoke in Spanish): \r\nGiven that today is the International Day of Peace, \r\nit is an honour to present a message of achievements \r\nand challenges from the Republic of El Salvador on \r\nthe global agenda to General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. I would like to express our solidarity \r\nand condolences to the people and the Government of \r\nMexico, which have faced a devastating earthquake. \r\nWe extend the same message of sympathy to the \r\nCaribbean countries and the United States, which have \r\nbeen affected by hurricanes.\r\nEl Salvador identifies with the central theme of \r\nthis debate and agrees to follow up on such a vision \r\nfor the fulfilment of Agenda 2030 and its Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs). Agenda 2030 constitutes an \r\nimportant instrument for the dialogue and consensus-\r\nbuilding processes in El Salvador. We have contributed \r\nour experiences to the discussion at the High-Level \r\nPolitical Forum on Sustainable Development, to which \r\nwe submitted our first national voluntary review on the \r\nimplementation of Agenda 2030.\r\nEl Salvador has a national agenda for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, which was developed through the creation \r\nof an institutional architecture for its implementation. \r\nWe have allocated more than half of public spending to \r\neducation, health and social protection in order to reduce \r\nextreme poverty and enhance social development. \r\nWe have also increased the allocation of resources to \r\nprogrammes focused on poverty reduction.\r\nIn the area of education, which is a priority for \r\nour Government, we have made significant progress \r\nin eradicating illiteracy and increasing the availability \r\nof an inclusive education, while maintaining a high \r\nlevel of primary-education coverage over the past four \r\nyears. Also noteworthy are our advances in food and \r\nnutritional security, through which we have reduced \r\nchronic child malnutrition. We promote family farming \r\nby supporting small producers, improving their incomes \r\nand ensuring food security through participatory and \r\nsustainable processes.\r\nIn order to address employment and opportunities \r\nwe established the National Employment System, which \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It is important to point out \r\nthat we have great challenges before us, especially in \r\nthe fiscal area, where agreements are urgently needed \r\nif we are to achieve greater dynamism and economic \r\ndevelopment that goes hand in hand with social progress \r\nand benefits for the people.\r\nSuch sustainable development requires an \r\nenvironment of peace and security, and for that reason \r\nwe have promoted a process of dialogue at the political \r\nand multisectoral levels. It was out of that process \r\nthat we developed the Plan El Salvador Seguro. It has \r\na comprehensive approach aimed at addressing the \r\nphenomenon of violence, emphasizes prevention and \r\nfirmly respects human rights. Two years after we began \r\nto implement it, we have seen good results, such as \r\nreducing the homicide rate by 50 per cent and achieving \r\na similar percentage with regard to extortion.\r\nI must stress that without a financing strategy, \r\nadapting Agenda 2030 to national planning becomes a \r\ncomplex exercise. That is why I reiterate the pressing \r\nneed to link Agenda 2030 to the Addis Ababa Agenda \r\nfor Action, which sets out more than 100 measures and \r\npractices aimed at generating investment that will drive \r\nsustainable development over the next 15 years.\r\nIn our case, we conceived a financing strategy that \r\nembraces all sources and calls for shared responsibilities \r\nwith regard to achieving the SDGs at the national level. \r\nAgainst that backdrop, we recognize that the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, which seeks to \r\neradicate poverty and inequality, presents a challenge \r\nfor middle-income countries, such as El Salvador. For \r\nnations that are considered to fall in that category, it \r\nis imperative to eliminate measurements based solely \r\non average income, or only on economic income, and \r\nthat conceal economic, social and cultural inequalities. \r\nThat is why we reaffirm the call to go beyond and move \r\ntowards the implementation of a multidimensional \r\ncalculation.\r\nIt is equally relevant to refer to sovereign debt, given \r\nits negative impacts on development. A restructuring \r\nmechanism that promotes a fair and shared distribution \r\nbetween debtors and creditors based on human needs \r\nis a priority. On the other hand, a crucial issue for El \r\nSalvador is the issue of migration. It is very important to \r\nbear in mind that in 2015, when we adopted Agenda 2030, \r\nwe recognized the positive contribution of migrants on \r\ninclusive growth and sustainable development.\r\nThat is why my country promoted the inclusion of the \r\nmigration issue in the SDGs, and we have prioritized it \r\nin our national agenda for sustainable development. We \r\nbelieve that achieving a global compact for safe, orderly \r\nand regular migration presents a true opportunity, but \r\nalso a challenge. It is an opportunity that will enable us \r\nto tackle the issue of migration from a standpoint that \r\nensures human development and human rights, and a \r\nchallenge that we must commit to addressing in order \r\nto eliminate stereotypes that stigmatize migration as a \r\ncriminal act.\r\nToday, as anti-migration policies and movements \r\ngather strength throughout the world, we most \r\nenergetically condemn xenophobia directed against \r\nrefugees and migrants. My country therefore believes \r\nthat it is vital to acknowledge the positive contributions \r\nand participation of migrants in their destination \r\nsocieties and their positive effect on sustainable \r\ndevelopment. One example of that contribution is our \r\ntemporary protected-status population in the United \r\nStates, for whom we hope that such status will be \r\nextended.\r\nWe should facilitate conditions that seek to regulate \r\nimmigration status and promote the rights of migrants, \r\nas well as their integration into the host country culture \r\nand labour market, and their health care, education and \r\nhousing systems, and acknowledge the contribution \r\nthat they make to the economies of their host societies. \r\nIn line with that position, we have submitted an \r\ninitiative to our Legislative Assembly to help regulate \r\nthe migratory situation of nationals who come from \r\nneighbouring countries to El Salvador, mostly for work. \r\nIn July 2017 we launched our national policy for the \r\nprotection and development of Salvadoran migrants \r\nand their families as a tool aimed at strengthening \r\nthe protection and promotion of the development of \r\nSalvadorans abroad and of their relatives at home, as \r\nwell as the returning population.\r\nIn order to obtain a culture of peace at the global \r\nlevel, it is essential to recognize and give priority to \r\ndialogue and peaceful solutions to controversies. As \r\na country that suffered internal armed conflict for \r\nover a decade and was able to find lasting solutions \r\nonly through dialogue and negotiation, we know very \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 3/24\r\nwell how important peaceful means are for resolving \r\ndisputes. In that context, we welcome the fresh \r\nefforts for dialogue between the opposition and the \r\nGovernment of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nWe congratulate the President of the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Danilo Medina, on that important initiative.\r\nFurthermore, I call for an end to the economic \r\nblockade imposed by the United States on Cuba, so that \r\nwe may begin a new chapter in our Caribbean history \r\nand look firmly ahead to the future. We hope for an \r\nadvance in relations between those two neighbours and \r\nhope that other unilateral measures that hinder progress \r\nand the well-being of both peoples will be avoided.\r\nMy country firmly supports all initiatives that \r\npromote and strengthen the disarmament regime, \r\narms regulation and the fight against organized crime \r\nand terrorism, and all efforts to achieve international \r\nsecurity and world peace. I reiterate our concern in the \r\nface of the threat posed to humankind by the existence \r\nof weapons of nuclear destruction. The use or threat \r\nof use of such weapons is a clear violation of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and of international and \r\nhumanitarian law.\r\nIn another area, we must adopt urgent measures to \r\ncombat the negative effects of climate change, which \r\ncontinue to compromise economic development, \r\nnatural resources and the well-being of countries such \r\nas El Salvador, which produces few greenhouse gases. \r\nIt concerns us to see regression in the international \r\nconsensus to fight the negative effects of climate \r\nchange at the multilateral level.\r\nI wish to end by highlighting that the peace \r\nagreements that we signed in 1992, which have now \r\nreached their twenty-fifth birthday, taught us that the \r\nbest victories are those won through the hard work and \r\nwill of all parties. In that vein, I express my gratitude \r\nto the Secretary-General for the support and solidarity \r\nthat he has provided us with in the process of national \r\ndialogue that we are developing in El Salvador, which is \r\nnow in its second stage towards reaching an agreement.\r\nIn that same spirit of joint work and cooperation, I \r\ncall on Member States to unite in implementing the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, truly focusing on \r\npeople, so that no one is left behind and all those living \r\non this planet can do so in dignity and peace.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Republic of El Salvador for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Salvador Sánchez Cerén, President of the \r\nRepublic of El Salvador, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Azali Assoumani, President of the \r\nUnion of the Comoros\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nGeneral Assembly will now hear an address by the \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros.\r\nMr. Azali Assoumani, President of the Union of the \r\nComoros, was escorted into the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Azali \r\nAssoumani, President of the Union of the Comoros, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Assoumani (spoke in French): It is an \r\nhonour to once again address the General Assembly. \r\nOn this occasion, I would first like to join those who \r\nhave spoken before me in this Hall to express the great \r\ncompassion that the people and the Government of my \r\ncountry, the Union of the Comoros, feel for the people \r\nand the Government of the United States of America, \r\nthe host country of the Assembly, in the aftermath of \r\nthe hurricane that recently devastated Texas.\r\nAs an island State, I would also like to extend our \r\ngreatest sympathy to the French Government and the \r\npeoples and islands of the Caribbean for both the heavy \r\nloss of life and the magnitude of material damage \r\nwrought by Hurricane Irma. Those repeated natural \r\ncatastrophes are a resonating call to climate sceptics \r\nto remind them that now is the time for commitment \r\nand action if we wish to mitigate, as far as possible, \r\nthe causes of such devastating threats linked to global \r\nwarming.\r\nI would also like to associate the voice of the \r\nComoros with those who spoke earlier today to express \r\nour deepest condolences and full solidarity to the \r\nGovernment and the people of Mexico following the \r\nviolent earthquake that recently struck the heart of \r\nMexico, causing hundreds of deaths and disappearances, \r\nas well as tremendous damage.\r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n4/24 17-29591\r\nAllow me to commend the President on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session and to voice true optimism for \r\nsuccess in our work under his leadership as a seasoned \r\nstatesman. His predecessor, His Excellency Peter \r\nThomson, also merits the admiration and gratitude of \r\nmy delegation and all others for his remarkable energy \r\nin accomplishing his mission during the previous \r\nsession.\r\nTo Secretary-General Guterres and to all Members \r\nof our prestigious institution, we reiterate our \r\nreadiness to make our modest contribution towards \r\nthe achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\n(SDGs) and the upholding of peace and security, for \r\nwhich the United Nations is constantly working with \r\nself lessness and devotion. \r\nMy country, the Union of the Comoros, on behalf of \r\nwhich I speak, appreciates the responsibility borne by \r\nthe international community in the light of the gravity \r\nof the situation throughout the world and the concerns \r\nplaguing people in many countries. I would therefore \r\nlike to voice our commitment to the United Nations and \r\ncommend its efforts to tackle present-day challenges \r\nand threats to peace, stability and collective prosperity. \r\nI welcome the relevance of the theme selected for this \r\nseventy-second session, which enables us to highlight \r\nthe increasingly evident link between the environment, \r\npeace and security.\r\nHere, I would like to reiterate our tribute to the \r\nGovernments of France and Morocco for the work \r\naccomplished at the twenty-first and twenty-second \r\nsessions of the Conference of the Parties of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change, \r\nencouraging each of our countries, particularly island \r\nStates, to give utmost priority to everything that has to \r\ndo with the survival of our planet.\r\nThe general theme of our discussion today focuses \r\non people, the striving for peace and a decent life for \r\nall on a sustainable planet, and it incorporates many \r\nissues that lie at the heart of the concerns of the \r\ninternational community. They include migration, \r\npreventive diplomacy, conflict prevention, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and United Nations reform. Speaking \r\nabout the human being also implies a reference to \r\nhuman rights, including human dignity, which are \r\nan uppermost priority for our Organization. Global \r\nwarming, migrations, conflicts, wars and terrorism \r\nare all challenges that all continents, and Africa in \r\nparticular, are facing and require urgent responses.\r\nTerrorism, which represents the absolute \r\nrepudiation of the human being, has become a scourge \r\nthat we condemn and that we must fight mercilessly on \r\na global scale with all our strength. In that regard, I \r\ncall for the rejection of the dangerous confusion and \r\nunfortunate association between the terms “terrorism” \r\nand “Islam”. There is no Islamic terrorism, just as there \r\nis no Christian or Jewish terrorism. Terrorists belong to \r\nno faith. Terrorists are simply barbarians.\r\nMy country, the Union of the Comoros, which I \r\nhave the honour to lead, is a country whose people are \r\neducated in the practices of a religion, Islam, which \r\nadvocates love of one’s neighbour, tolerance and respect \r\nfor human dignity. Those principles f ly in the face of \r\nthe cowardly, barbaric acts committed by groups acting \r\nfaithlessly and lawlessly. By no means can they be \r\nassociated with our religion.\r\nWe vehemently condemn the atrocities targeting \r\nminorities and communities — yesterday, unfortunately, \r\nin Bosnia and Herzegovina against Muslims and today \r\nin Burma against the Rohingyas, as well as atrocities \r\nperpetrated against minorities throughout the world. \r\nThe inhumane and savage nature of such attacks is a \r\nshock to our conscience as we see attempts at ethnic \r\ncleansing committed against the poorest segments \r\nof society. I dare hope that our Organization will be \r\nable to uphold the most basic rights of the oppressed, \r\nregardless of origin, race, gender and creed.\r\nWhat priority do we attach to the human being in \r\nthe face of such ghastly scenes where human rights \r\nare trampled upon on a daily basis? The international \r\ncommunity must absolutely act to end such acts and \r\npunish the perpetrators, at the risk of losing credibility \r\nbefore the people whose eyes are riveted on our \r\ninstitution, which has the right, duty and ability to \r\nprovide them with protection, dignity and well-being.\r\nIt is by guaranteeing peace, security and human \r\nrights that we can collectively promote the SDGs, \r\nespecially for a decent existence, health for all, \r\ngender equality and education for new generations. \r\nTechnological possibilities present immense potential \r\nfor our young people.  Goal 7 of the SDGs is geared to \r\nensuring universal access to reliable, sustainable and \r\nmodern energy services at an affordable cost. The lack \r\nof widespread access to electricity is a hindrance to \r\nsustainable growth, particularly in Africa. \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 5/24\r\nIn the Union of the Comoros, in one year, we managed \r\nto end the electricity shortages and constant load-\r\nshedding that had plagued our economy, our businesses \r\nand our homes, and to emerge from a protracted energy \r\ncrisis. However, now that the emergency is over, we \r\nneed to ensure that those results can be made long-term \r\nthrough a medium- and long-term energy policy and \r\nthrough the development of renewable energy with a \r\nlow-carbon footprint. To succeed in that and achieve \r\nthe 17 Sustainable Development Goals, we must rely on \r\nourselves and our own resources above all. However, \r\nwe need international solidarity, but also the solidarity \r\nof industrialists, bankers and international investors.\r\nThe Union of the Comoros has returned to political \r\nstability after witnessing three peaceful transfers of \r\npower at the highest State level over the past 15 years. \r\nToday, we are offering an incentive policy and support \r\nmeasures with a more attractive investment code.\r\nMy country, as a small island developing State, is \r\nsubject to myriad risks. Nevertheless, my Government’s \r\ndetermination to work for the well-being of our people \r\nhas prompted us to set a goal of making the Union of \r\nthe Comoros an emerging country by 2030. There is \r\ngreat optimism driving us forward, and we hope that \r\nindicators will soon attest to our progress towards \r\nthat ambitious and lofty goal. The main thrusts of \r\nour Government converge on the achievement of that \r\ngoal, which is underpinned by a national development \r\nstrategy.\r\nFurthermore, there is a great deal of work under \r\nway to endow my country in the near future with \r\nadequate resources in terms of energy, road, port and \r\nairport infrastructure, economic recovery and the \r\nestablishment of a framework for consultations. That \r\nwill bring the private and public sectors closer together \r\nand will afford opportunities for civil society and \r\npolitical parties to fully play their roles.\r\nFor that reason, at the initiative of the elders and \r\nleaders of our country, we have launched an inclusive \r\ndialogue among the various components and forces of \r\nthe Comorian nation. There are plans to hold a national \r\nforum in December to take stock of our 42 years of \r\nindependence. That is an inclusive, broadened national \r\nframework, one that includes all national life forces. Its \r\nmission is to assess the past, draw lessons from it and \r\nplan for a better future under better conditions.\r\nI have therefore unreservedly embraced this \r\nparticipatory, inclusive and representative approach, \r\nand the debates will lead to conclusions on everything \r\nthat will strengthen the peace, security, calm and \r\nstability of the country and determine its future \r\nby drawing lessons from the past. In order for that \r\nimportant event to come to the hoped-for historic \r\nconclusions for the benefit of our people, I ask for the \r\npartnership and support of the international community \r\nand international and regional institutions, to which I \r\nwould like to reiterate here once again our gratitude \r\nand our most sincere thanks for their unfailing support, \r\nespecially when the Comoros almost sank into chaos 20 \r\nyears ago. It is with their invaluable assistance that the \r\ncountry has returned to the path of peace and stability.\r\nThe displacement of populations — in other \r\nwords, migration — destabilizes both the countries of \r\norigin and the host countries. However, the Union of \r\nthe Comoros refuses to allow the term “immigrants” \r\nto be applied to Comorians who visit the Island of \r\nMayotte, which is an integral part of its territory, \r\ndespite the fact that it unfortunately remains under \r\nFrench administration. Indeed, the thousands of my \r\ncompatriots who die each year in their attempts to go to \r\nMayotte, a part of their territory, is not an immigration \r\nissue. The question of the Comorian Island of Mayotte \r\nrelates to territorial integrity. Forty-two years after my \r\ncountry acceded to its international sovereignty, and in \r\nthe absence of a solution to the issue since 1975, that \r\nquestion continues not only to weaken stability but also \r\nto hinder the country’s socioeconomic development.\r\nI therefore welcome the continuation of the dialogue \r\nbetween my country and France in the quest for a just \r\nand equitable solution to the dispute over the Comorian \r\nIsland of Mayotte, consistent with international law and \r\nrespectful of the interests of each party. I pray to Allah \r\nthe Almighty that He will keep us alive so that next \r\nyear from this same rostrum I will be able to share with \r\nthe Assembly the positive and consensual results of that \r\ndialogue.\r\nFrance is a permanent member of the Security \r\nCouncil. Its history links it to freedom, democracy, \r\njustice, respect for international law and the promotion \r\nof peace. It does not intend to divide or separate a \r\npeople. Its interest, like ours, lies in a world of stability \r\nand a peaceful and prosperous Indian Ocean region \r\nlooking towards a better future.\r\nIn the Near East and the Middle East, the \r\ninternational community must mobilize further to end \r\nthe martyrdom of the thousands of children crushed \r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n6/24 17-29591\r\nunder bombs, the hunger imposed on populations, the \r\nuse of chemical weapons, the chaos and the partition \r\nprocesses in countries at war. The international \r\ncommunity must sanction the use of chemical weapons. \r\nWe must act to ensure that hope is restored for the \r\ndisplaced and refugees and that the countries affected \r\ncan recover their stability and territorial integrity.\r\nWith regard to the Middle East, the lack of a solution \r\nto the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and the current status \r\nquo are fuelling insecurity and destabilization in the \r\nregion. The solution to that conflict lies in stopping the \r\nunacceptable colonization of the Palestinian territories, \r\nthe end of injustice and violence against the Palestinian \r\npopulations and the global settlement of the conflict, \r\nwhich is more than a half century old, on the basis of \r\nthe two-State solution, which will fulfil the Palestinian \r\npeople’s right to full sovereignty, with East Jerusalem \r\nas its capital.\r\nBeyond solidarity speeches, support for causes, \r\nthe condemnation of attacks on friendly countries and \r\npeoples, the expressions of compassion for victims, \r\nand the calls for respect for the right of peoples, \r\nthe sovereignty of States and the integrity of their \r\nterritories, we must show greater commitment. In any \r\ncase, the Union of the Comoros believes in the United \r\nNations and its capacity to face today’s challenges. \r\nWe believe that such an Organization is possible. We \r\nbelieve that we are able to build such a United Nations \r\ntogether.\r\nBefore concluding my remarks, allow me to take \r\nthe opportunity of the coming of the Islamic New Year \r\n1439 to convey to the General Assembly my greetings \r\nand best wishes for peace, progress and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Union of the Comoros for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Azali Assoumani, President of the Union of the \r\nComoros, was escorted from the General Assembly \r\nHall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., \r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Palau.\r\nMr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Tommy Esang \r\nRemengesau Jr., President of the Republic of Palau, and \r\nto invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Remengesau: I would like first to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on \r\nhis election to lead our work in the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-second session. I would also like to thank \r\nhis Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for his exceptional \r\nservice during his recently completed term as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nAt the outset, the people of Palau extend our \r\ndeepest condolences to those who have had their lives \r\ndevastated by the recent spate of hurricanes, typhoons, \r\nearthquakes and other natural disasters across Asia and \r\nthe Americas. We must not forget that many do not have \r\nthe resources necessary to rebuild. The international \r\ncommunity must work harder to ensure that they are \r\nnot abandoned. Such record-breaking storms are a \r\nharbinger of worse to come on a hotter planet.\r\nPalau, in the Pacific, has experienced at first hand \r\nthe impact of climate extremes. For us, those super-\r\nstorms are akin to ticking time bombs: no one knows \r\nwhen or where the next one will detonate, but we are \r\nkeenly aware that they can wipe out years of progress \r\nin the span of hours.\r\nThe President’s clear determination to focus \r\nfuture efforts on conflict prevention, peace, migration \r\nand a decent life for all on a sustainable planet is \r\ncertainly timely and well attuned to the realities of our \r\ngeneration. In fact, his attention to those very different \r\nyet related issues demonstrates a clear understanding \r\nof the complex times in which we live and the need to \r\nconnect the dots between the causes and the effects of \r\nthe interrelated challenges that we face.\r\nIn this modern world, we must continue to expand \r\nour cooperation at every level — private, public, not-\r\nfor-profit and political — within the context of a global \r\nnetwork that establishes fair and transparent guidelines \r\nthat prescribe how to act and react to those dynamic \r\ntopics. The only body that can fill that essential void is \r\nthe United Nations.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 7/24\r\nWith respect to sustainable development, we \r\nrecognized, in 2015, through the adoption of the 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals, that a global rights-\r\nbased regime was necessary in the context of a global \r\npartnership, if we are to successfully eradicate poverty, \r\naddress universal inequalities and provide economic \r\nand social opportunities to all for the peoples of the \r\nworld.\r\nThrough the creation of Sustainable Development \r\nGoal 14, we finally recognized that the oceans are a \r\nresource that belong to and serve all the peoples of \r\nthe world and must be protected as such. By coming \r\ntogether and finally agreeing on the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change, we established a global commitment \r\nto begin the process of reducing greenhouse gases to \r\nacceptable levels.\r\nYet even as we worked hard to respond to that \r\nglobal environmental crisis through joint actions, we \r\nhave found other issues of security and peace taking \r\nthe forefront in our international conversation. As the \r\nIslamic State in Iraq and the Sham (ISIS) is pushed back \r\nfrom its strongholds in Syria and Iraq, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea has been firing missiles \r\nand detonating atomic and possibly hydrogen bombs, \r\nthereby threatening worldwide peace and harmony. At \r\nthe same time, migrants throughout the world are forced \r\nto f lee their countries to escape the ever-increasing \r\nlevels of violence.\r\nThose are issues that must be dealt with globally \r\nthrough strong multinational institutions and \r\npartnerships. If those efforts are to be successful \r\nwithin the framework of the United Nations, the United \r\nNations must be strengthened so that all of its members \r\ncan believe in the fairness and effectiveness of the \r\noverall international negotiation and dispute-resolution \r\nprocess. These are the issues that our global focus is \r\ncentred upon: a decent life for all and a sustainable planet.\r\nI believe that we can all agree that, in terms of \r\npeace and security, inclusive sustainable development \r\nfrequently prevents conflicts and sustains peace. \r\nHowever, peace is not always achievable, and when that \r\nis the case, the United Nations must facilitate efforts \r\nto respond to aggression and violence. Palau therefore \r\nsupports all efforts and United Nations resolutions \r\naimed at bringing North Korea to the negotiating \r\ntable. The threat posed to the innocent people of Guam \r\nis a threat to us in Palau and the entire region. Palau \r\nalso reaffirms its support for international efforts \r\nto eradicate terrorist organizations, such as ISIS and \r\nAl-Qaida. We must also support the Secretary-General’s \r\nefforts to revamp the United Nations architectures and \r\nprocedures for peace and security development and \r\nmanagement as a significant component of the overall \r\nreform of the Organization.\r\nThe Pacific small island developing States (SIDS) \r\nface a unique set of security and development challenges. \r\nHowever, the United Nations presence in the region is \r\nquite limited. In shepherding that process, I urge the \r\nSecretary-General to recall the guiding principle that \r\nwas so successful in delivering the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development: leave no country behind.\r\nTaking into account the recent actions by North \r\nKorea, we must take seriously the long-term need to \r\nban nuclear weapons. A good place to start would be \r\nby acceding to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. I must give credit to the leaders of my \r\ncountry, who, more than 30 years ago, recognized the \r\nthreat of nuclear weapons and banned the use, testing \r\nand storage of nuclear weapons in Palau’s Constitution. \r\nIn their honour, I signed that Treaty yesterday.\r\nIf we are to find success in achieving our 17 \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the 2030 \r\nAgenda, we are going to have to face the hard reality \r\nthat the costs are very significant. Success will require \r\nall available partnerships and the development of the \r\nnecessary means of implementation in line with the \r\n2030 Agenda, the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the \r\nSIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action, known as the \r\nSamoa Pathway.\r\nIn the area of climate change, we must continue \r\nto work to achieve the full implementation of the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change. I would like \r\nto congratulate my colleague from the Pacific His \r\nExcellency Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama of Fiji \r\non his imminent ascension to the presidency of the \r\nupcoming twenty-third session of the Conference of the \r\nParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change. In order to strengthen his efforts, Palau \r\nis seeking the appointment of a Special Representative \r\nof the Secretary-General for climate and security. \r\nThe appointment of a Special Representative would \r\nsignificantly aid us in our preparations to confront \r\nthat multifaceted challenge and would enhance United \r\nNations reform proposals.\r\nMy country, although small, is very proud of its \r\ncommitment to achieving our Global 2030 Agenda. To \r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n8/24 17-29591\r\nhelp protect our oceans, we have established one of the \r\nlargest protected areas in the world. Within that context, \r\nwe emphasize our support for a new implementing \r\nagreement on the conservation and sustainable use of \r\nbiodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. We \r\nhave also supported resolution WCC-2016-Res-050, \r\nentitled “Increasing marine protected area coverage for \r\neffective marine biodiversity conservation”, adopted \r\nby the International Union for Conservation of Nature \r\nand Natural Resources in 2016, which promises to work \r\ntowards designating and effectively setting aside at \r\nleast 30 per cent of coastal States’ national waters as \r\nmarine protected areas by 2030. In addition, we have \r\ncommitted to addressing and taking action with regard \r\nto marine pollution in all its forms.\r\nAt the Pacific Islands Forum Leaders Meeting, \r\nPalau also called on other countries to join it in \r\nbecoming parties to the Agreement on Port State \r\nMeasures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, \r\nUnreported and Unregulated Fishing, an international \r\ntreaty that will help stop the transfer of illegally caught \r\nfish and marine life through our ports. I would like to \r\nmake the same appeal here today.\r\nIn our work to save our oceans, we welcome the \r\nappointment of His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of \r\nFiji as the first Special Envoy of the Secretary-General \r\nfor the Oceans, which promises to bring greater \r\nattention to one of our most urgent priorities. Palau \r\nextends its congratulations to its close friend from Fiji.\r\nThose types of commitment require the strong \r\nsupport of a broad alliance of partners. Fortunately, \r\nmy country has a long history of strong partnerships. \r\nThe United States continues to support Palau in \r\nits development and movement towards economic \r\nindependence. We have a shared history and over the \r\ndecades have become close friends. We recognize the \r\nunique relationship that we share. In these difficult \r\ntimes, we support and participate in the efforts of the \r\nUnited States, on behalf of the world community, to \r\ncombat terrorism, bring closure to the hostilities in \r\nSyria and reduce the nuclear threat emanating from \r\nNorth Korea. We also thank the United States for \r\nits ongoing support for our efforts to establish our \r\nnational marine sanctuary. We look forward this year to \r\ncompleting our compact of free association agreement \r\nwith the United States, which will ref lect that close and \r\nspecial relationship.\r\nPalau also would like to acknowledge the great \r\nfriendship that it has with Japan and the very significant \r\neconomic support that we have received from that \r\ncountry over the years. We continue to express our \r\nsupport for the expansion and reform of the Security \r\nCouncil and Japan’s permanent membership on the \r\nSecurity Council. We wish to express our sincere \r\nthanks for the Nippon Foundation’s generous support \r\nto enhance partnership and collaboration in our marine \r\nsurveillance and enforcement efforts. We would \r\nalso like to recognize the very broad list of partners \r\nacross the world who make our efforts to achieve a \r\nsustainable future possible, including the Republic of \r\nChina on Taiwan, Australia, New Zealand, Monaco, \r\nItaly, the Netherlands, the European Union, private \r\norganizations, non-governmental organizations and \r\ncivil society, among many others.\r\nAt the end of the day, our success will depend \r\nupon the development and maintenance of genuine \r\nand durable partnerships at every level of society. The \r\nissues that we face are becoming increasingly severe, \r\ndangerous and global in scope. They cannot be dealt \r\nwith at the national or regional level alone. At no time \r\nin the history of my country or, indeed, the history of \r\nthe world has the need for a strong global partnership \r\nof countries, organizations and people, through a single \r\nbinding assembly of nations been more important. The \r\nUnited Nations has the potential to reconcile our global \r\nissues if — and only if — its Members are willing to \r\nrecognize those issues and take the necessary action to \r\ndevelop and implement appropriate solutions. \r\nMy small country — despite its size — is willing \r\nto act in concert with the other nations of this great \r\nOrganization to achieve a better life for our children, \r\ngrandchildren and all future generations. \r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Palau for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Tommy Esang Remengesau Jr., President of the \r\nRepublic of Palau, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President of \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 9/24\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour \r\nto welcome to the United Nations His Excellency \r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President of \r\nthe Republic of Equatorial Guinea, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly. \r\nPresident Obiang Nguema Mbasogo (spoke in \r\nSpanish): Although we currently live in a world of \r\nunrest and insecurity that is being scourged by an \r\nunprecedented global economic crisis, the Republic of \r\nEquatorial Guinea is participating rather optimistically \r\nin the political and diplomatic open debates on the \r\nitems on the agenda of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session. We believe that the topics \r\nselected for debate encapsulate the concern of every \r\nnation to achieve the objectives that were proposed in \r\nSan Francisco in 1945, so that we can achieve a world of \r\npeace, well-being and security for humankind. \r\nWe wish to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on \r\nhis election as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-second session. We believe that his wealth \r\nof political and diplomatic experience, that of his \r\nGovernment and the experience of the other members \r\nof the Bureau will help to guide our fruitful discussions \r\nto build a better world. \r\nWe also hope that the work of this session will \r\ncontinue on from the previous session’s endeavours, \r\nduring which, under the guidance of His Excellency \r\nMr. Peter Thomson, the United Nations made a correct \r\nassessment of the current state of global affairs. \r\nThat further fuels our optimism that we can arrive at \r\ndefinitive and sustainable solutions for the complex \r\nproblems affecting our planet. In that joint endeavour, \r\nthe work of the Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. António Guterres, has been highly praiseworthy, \r\nwhich is evident from the selection of issues before us.\r\nIt should be recalled once again that Chapter I \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations enshrines the \r\nintent of its Member States to build a world of peace \r\nand well-being for humanity by encouraging friendly \r\nrelations and mutual respect for the independence and \r\nsovereignty of every nation. No Member State should \r\nconsider itself exempt from that duty. We believe that \r\nall the Governments of the world, if one is politically \r\nhonest, are working for the welfare of their nations, \r\nwhich is why every country designs programmes to \r\npromote human rights, the democratization of society \r\nand socioeconomic development, thus ensuring the \r\nwell-being of their populations.\r\nHowever, despite our optimism in this debate, we \r\nexpress our deep concern about the numerous armed \r\nconflicts and the sociopolitical instability that are \r\nruining the socioeconomic structure of States, precisely \r\nbecause of interventions in the internal affairs of other \r\nStates, which is specifically condemned by the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. \r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea is greatly \r\nconcerned, because major wars that have destroyed \r\nentire nations have had Member States as powerful \r\nparticipating actors. Such States believe that armed \r\nforce is the only way to bring about peace and resolve \r\nconflicts, while forgetting that war can never do that. \r\nRather, it compounds and perpetuates conflicts, leading \r\nto disorder, destruction, desolation and ruin. Military \r\nforce should never be the recourse used by the United \r\nNations to ensure international peace and security. \r\nThe Assembly must remember that international peace \r\nand security can be ensured only when every country \r\nenjoys internal peace and each country’s fundamental \r\nand inalienable rights are respected.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea is fully aware \r\nof and grateful for the support and confidence of \r\nalmost all Member States regarding its candidacy as \r\na non-permanent member of the Security Council. We \r\nwish to convey here our total rejection of the use of force \r\nas the only recourse available to the United Nations.\r\nWe are party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. We condemn not only the use and \r\nmanufacture of such weapons in conflicts between \r\nStates, but also their possession and distribution. \r\nWe believe that the terms of that Treaty are still \r\ninsufficient — they should include the destruction \r\nof nuclear weapons, wherever they may be. Their \r\npossession by some States makes other States believe \r\nthey have the right to possess them as well.\r\nAs a member of the Security Council, the Republic \r\nof Equatorial Guinea will cooperate with all States to \r\nensure peace in the world, which should mean ensuring \r\npeace in each country and protecting its political, \r\neconomic, social and cultural rights.\r\nThere is also a great deal of uncertainty about the fact \r\nthat, despite the commendable initiatives in the 1990s \r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n10/24 17-29591\r\nto combat malnutrition, hunger, climate change and \r\nothers, and despite the High-level Plenary Meeting of \r\nthe General Assembly on the Millennium Development \r\nGoals held in 2010, after more than 20 years not much \r\nprogress has been seen in those areas. On the contrary, \r\nthere has been an increase in the number of people in \r\nthe world who go hungry; the environment continues \r\nto deteriorate, causing major disasters such as f loods, \r\nearthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis and the deaths of \r\nthousands of human beings and the destruction of the \r\ninfrastructure needed for human existence. The United \r\nNations is still very far from achieving the established \r\ngoals for the well-being of humankind.\r\nWe take this opportunity to express the condolences \r\nand solidarity of the people and the Government \r\nof Equatorial Guinea to the nations suffering from \r\ndisasters: Mexico, the United States, the countries of \r\nthe Caribbean and Sierra Leone, in Africa.\r\nAt the same time that we see those factors, we are \r\nalso witnessing international terrorism, extremism, \r\nxenophobia, human trafficking, emigration, piracy, \r\nthe phenomenon of mercenaries, major epidemics, \r\ntransborder crimes and an acute economic crisis that \r\nis currently affecting the entire world. All of those \r\nphenomena make it necessary to achieve greater \r\nawareness among nations of the need to establish more \r\ndirect cooperation among States and for all nations to \r\nundertake united, dynamic and coordinated action.\r\nNo matter how powerful a country may be, such \r\nevents mean that we must all pay attention, because no \r\nState is exempt from the responsibilities resulting from \r\nthe overbearing actions taken by some States against \r\nothers. We must therefore focus more on bringing about \r\npeace in the world and ensuring a healthy environment, \r\neliminating nuclear weapons and combating terrorism \r\nand piracy, which affect all countries. No country \r\nshould act as a policeman who imposes on others the \r\nprinciples of good governance, to which we all have \r\ncommitted ourselves anyway.\r\nWe want a world with a spirit that is equally \r\nparticipatory and egalitarian for women and men, \r\nand for nations large and small. We want a reform \r\nof the Security Council that enables the equitable \r\nparticipation of all continents and guarantees the rights \r\nof all nations. We want cooperation based on fairness. \r\nWe want respect for the cultural principles and values \r\nthat ensure the existence of every nation throughout \r\nthe ages. The premise here is that, in the absence of \r\nwars and the adverse phenomena we have mentioned, \r\nthe world could move towards sustainable development, \r\nthe achievement of the 2030 Agenda and Agenda 2063 \r\nof the African Union.\r\nThe Republic of Equatorial Guinea has taken \r\na giant step forward in its development, such that \r\nexpectations for its economic emergence have been \r\nestimated to occur by 2020. Unfortunately, however, its \r\nstrategy has had to be considerably modified because \r\nof the current economic crisis. That is what is currently \r\nbeing experienced in our country with regard to peace \r\nand development.\r\nThe threats to peace and stability that we have seen \r\nover recent years have been provoked from the outside, \r\nwith attempts to occupy the country and acts of piracy \r\nand terrorism that have been aimed at destabilizing \r\nthe peaceful and democratic system of the existing \r\nGovernment. They are attempts to disturb the peace \r\nand create riots for the benefit of fortune-hunting \r\nadventurers. That has resulted in unjust and gratuitous \r\naccusations against the leaders of our country and \r\nothers in the subregion, disparaging the legitimacy \r\nof our national sovereignty, and even ignoring the \r\ndecisions of international justice. All of that has been \r\npart of an attempt to confuse international public \r\nopinion about the reality of the progress achieved by \r\nEquatorial Guinea in order to justify, as always, an \r\nintention to impose so-called humanitarian intervention \r\nin our country.\r\nIn conclusion, we appeal for greater global \r\nconsensus to fight the phenomena impeding the progress \r\nand well-being of humankind. A more inclusive and \r\nparticipatory consensus on the strategies of action of \r\nthe United Nations and other international economic \r\norganizations is needed. The United Nations must lead \r\nus forward with the idea of a globalized world engaged \r\nin united action that does not condemn or punish, but \r\nrather helps the most needy to overcome the challenges \r\nof development.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Republic of Equatorial Guinea for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, President \r\nof the Republic of Equatorial Guinea, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 11/24\r\nAddress by Mr. Evaristo do Espirito Santo \r\nCarvalho, President of the Democratic Republic of \r\nSao Tome and Principe\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe.\r\nMr. Evaristo do Espirito Santo Carvalho, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I have the honour to welcome \r\nto the United Nations His Excellency Mr. Evaristo do \r\nEspirito Santo Carvalho, President of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Carvalho (spoke in Portuguese; English \r\ntext provided by the delegation): It is a great honour \r\nand joy for me to speak before the General Assembly \r\nfor the first time as Head of State of the Democratic \r\nRepublic of Sao Tome and Principe. The elections of \r\n2016, which brought me to power, once again illustrated \r\nunequivocally the level of democracy in Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe and the regular functioning of its institutions.\r\nAt the outset, allow me to take this opportunity \r\nto dedicate the first few words of my statement to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miroslav Lajcák, whom I congratulate \r\non his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, and to whom I \r\nconvey our full support for his mandate and wishes for \r\nhis great success. I would also like to congratulate the \r\noutgoing President, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\nfor the manner in which he conducted the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its previous session, that is to say, \r\njudiciously, with enthusiasm and unselfishness, in an \r\ninternational context that has posed serious challenges \r\nto our Organization.\r\nI also take this opportunity, before such a \r\ndistinguished audience, to congratulate Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres on his outstanding election. I \r\nam convinced that his political stature will undoubtedly \r\nenable him to lead the United Nations and address the \r\nmultiple global challenges involving the necessary \r\nreform of the Organization, including the Security \r\nCouncil, and efforts to promote peace, sustainable \r\ndevelopment and human rights.\r\nWithin the context of the complex global \r\nenvironment, the current challenges facing our peoples \r\nand countries are forcing us to delve deeper into the \r\nguiding spirit that undergirded the foundation of our \r\nOrganization as the ultimate and global guarantor in \r\nthe search for peaceful and lasting solutions that are \r\nconsensual and valid under international laws, so that \r\nwe might reach the desired goals of peace, security, \r\nstability and progress for all humankind. As such, \r\nwe can take advantage of this unique opportunity to \r\npursue our collective reflection aimed at strengthening \r\nthe role of the Organization. To that end, it is therefore \r\nurgent to carry out essential reforms that correspond to \r\nthe dynamics of today’s globalized world — that is, to \r\nenable the various specialized agencies of the United \r\nNations to act swiftly, effectively and in accordance \r\nwith to a process that was intended to be inclusive of all \r\nnations, as mandated under the Charter of the United \r\nNations, signed on 26 June 1945 in San Francisco.\r\nOn the other hand, we must strengthen our \r\nawareness of the need to implement mechanisms that \r\nallow for greater inclusion in decision-making and \r\nstrategic planning, which are the guiding principles \r\nof international financial institutions, namely, the \r\nInternational Monetary Fund and the World Bank. We \r\nfirmly believe that that is the only way for the economies \r\nof the developing countries to integrate more swiftly \r\ninto the global development process, whose benefits \r\nhave not yet been fully reflected in our own countries, \r\nwhile allowing for the renewal and strengthening of the \r\ncredibility of those institutions, which we consider to \r\nbe of central importance to the functioning of the global \r\nfinancial system, and to support our economic growth \r\nefforts aimed at the social and human development of \r\nour populations.\r\nThe theme of this session of the General Assembly, \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”, fits perfectly with \r\nthe present reality in which we live and corresponds \r\nto the challenges we face in search of a better world. \r\nTherefore, because the primary focus of any national, \r\nregional or international policy is to prioritize people and \r\ntheir yearning for a better life, as well as the continuous \r\nimprovement of the mechanisms needed to meet those \r\ngoals, the effort to achieve world peace is urgent and \r\nencompasses fundamental values that, we are certain, \r\nwe all stand for and strive to achieve. The serious \r\nconflicts that are troubling the world are of constant \r\nconcern, and their harmful consequences — which \r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n12/24 17-29591\r\naffect the well-being of humankind, the balance \r\nof relations among our nations and our economic, \r\nsocial and human development — must be firmly and \r\nuncategorically eschewed by us all.\r\nIn our view, the divisions that we are now seeing \r\nare the consequence of a lack of sincere, comprehensive \r\nand thoughtful dialogue among all parties. We cannot \r\nallow religious fanaticism, isolationism and populist \r\nrhetoric, which today are anachronisms — and I would \r\neven add selfish — to prevent us from accepting and \r\nliving with others’ differences or to continue to lead to \r\nsuch a degree of discord, thereby aggravating tensions \r\nand cutting short many lives, including those of our \r\nchildren, who, if they are well cared for, represent the \r\nreal future of our planet.\r\nIn that regard, we call for dialogue that will stress \r\nthe central mediating role of our Organization in order \r\nto ease tensions on the Korean peninsula.\r\nIt is also necessary to stop the proliferation of \r\nweapons in Syria, where people continue to live under \r\nthe threat of bomb attacks that have destroyed the \r\ncountry and torn apart its social fabric while claiming \r\nmany innocent lives. There is also a need to accelerate \r\ndialogue and the peace process in the Middle East, to \r\nwhich we once again make a firm appeal from this \r\nrostrum to find a peaceful and negotiated solution \r\nrespecting the right of the Palestinian people to \r\nconduct their own destiny, thereby respecting the basic \r\nprinciples of the United Nations.\r\nSimilarly, there is an urgent need to find a solution \r\nat the negotiating table for the tensions in Ukraine, the \r\nissue of Western Sahara and our brother country, the \r\nRepublic of Guinea-Bissau, which we greet warmly, \r\nand express the wish that its institutions will soon be \r\nrestored to their regular functions.\r\nAlthough the recent ministerial meeting of the \r\nAfrican initiative for peace and national reconciliation \r\nin the Central African Republic, which took place in \r\nthe Gabonese Republic on 17 July, was a step in the \r\nright direction, we have followed with great concern \r\nthe deterioration of the security situation there, \r\nwith incalculable humanitarian consequences, sadly \r\npointing to a situation of genocide. We therefore appeal \r\nfor efforts to be made to avoid another humanitarian \r\ndisaster in that African country.\r\nWe cannot but deplore the terrorist acts that \r\nunfortunately continue to claim so many lives \r\nthroughout the world. The barbarity and disrespect \r\nfor the precious good that is human life, committed \r\nthrough those indescribable, appalling and inhumane \r\nacts, warrant our firmest and vehement condemnation. \r\nIn that regard, we underline the atrocities committed \r\nby Boko Haram, among others, in our neighbouring \r\nand sister country Nigeria, which destabilized the \r\nentire region and severely slowed the implementation \r\nof sustainable development policies. Furthermore, \r\nthey have an undeniable echo in the deterioration of \r\nsecurity  in the Gulf of Guinea, where acts of maritime \r\npiracy and the illegal activities associated with it have \r\nplagued our region. The Democratic Republic of Sao \r\nTome and Principe, a State that is peaceful, democratic \r\nand open to dialogue, will always stand side by side \r\nwith its regional and international partners in all \r\ninitiatives seeking to eradicate that phenomenon from \r\nour societies.\r\nIf, as the theme of the session invokes, we truly \r\nwant to create the conditions for people to lead decent \r\nlives, it is urgent to address the problem of migratory \r\ncrises. Every day, we are confronted with the tragedies \r\nof thousands of people who, as they seek to escape \r\nconflicts and the miserable conditions that affect \r\ntheir countries, risk perishing on trips in precarious \r\ncircumstances as they go in search of a better life. There \r\nshould be no doubt that no one leaves their homeland or \r\nfaces such dangers on a whim.\r\nThere is a civic, ethical and moral responsibility \r\nto welcome those people and provide them with the \r\nindispensable humanitarian assistance necessary, but \r\nalso to create conditions conducive to mitigating the \r\nphenomenon in the countries of origin. That involves \r\nthe adoption of concerted policies for the reception of \r\nrefugees and the provision of support to countries of \r\norigin with a view to fostering an environment of peace \r\nand stability, so that they can provide the conditions \r\nnecessary for their people to take part in the life projects \r\nthey choose.\r\nWe also underline the important work of the \r\nGlobal Forum on Migration and Development, under \r\nthe co-chairmanship of Germany and Morocco, which \r\nbegan in January and will run until the end of 2018. \r\nThis shared leadership has made contributions to the \r\nUnited Nations Global Compact for Migration, which, \r\nwe are convinced, will lead to the much-desired policy \r\nof improved global migration to be adopted by the \r\ninternational community in 2018.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 13/24\r\nWe also welcome the recent French initiative that \r\nbrought together a European-Africa joint mini-summit, \r\nheld in Paris in late August, that sought to find ways \r\nto overcome Africa’s significant migratory f low to \r\nEurope, which has also transformed the Mediterranean \r\nSea into a veritable cemetery.\r\nI cannot fail to mention the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, the priorities of which go directly to the core of \r\nwhat we have been expressing. If we achieve — as we \r\nbelieve it possible to do — the eradication of poverty \r\nand hunger, the promotion of social and economic \r\ndevelopment, the protection of the rights of all, gender \r\nequality, the empowerment of women, a reversal of \r\nclimate change, access to quality services and the \r\nprovision of special attention to vulnerable groups, then \r\nwe will see a positive evolution in the living conditions \r\nwithin our nations. Let us therefore all work to that end.\r\nIn that regard, we highlight the efforts of the African \r\nUnion, enshrined in the guidelines of the important \r\nand ambitious Agenda 2063. Its implementation \r\nand success will contribute greatly to making such \r\nobjectives more easily reachable. It is without a doubt an \r\ninclusive document, based on the cultural specificities \r\nof each country, which consciously demand from our \r\nGovernments a very clear commitment to its success.\r\nHowever successful we may be in achieving the \r\ngoals of peace, stability and progress on a world scale, \r\nnone of it will make any sense if we do not know how to \r\ntake care of our planet. Combating the phenomenon of \r\nclimate change is perhaps the most complex objective \r\nrequiring all humankind to participate. The success of \r\nthis fight is perhaps the greatest legacy we can leave to \r\nfuture generations.\r\nIn that context, the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange is a historic, broad-based consensus on the \r\nchallenges we face in that area and the financial and \r\ntechnological means to overcome them. However, \r\nthe measures proposed have yet to be implemented. \r\nEvery day we further postpone the issue, the more our \r\nplanet suffers. Increasingly extreme weather events \r\ncause irreparable damage to our ecosystem and life \r\non Earth. I therefore appeal, without prejudice, for the \r\nthe members of the Assembly to demonstrate political \r\nboldness, in the understanding that each should \r\ncontribute according to the principle of common but \r\ndifferentiated responsibilities.\r\nSao Tome and Principe, a small island developing \r\nState, has spared no effort in that regard, and I want \r\nto assure those present of our firm commitment to \r\nbeing at the forefront of implementing climate-change \r\nmitigation measures. However, I note, along with \r\nmany other speakers, that funding for such measures \r\nlacks the support of the international community. \r\nCooperation agreements should be established with \r\nambitious funding for climate issues and guarantees for \r\nthe effective and efficient transfer of technology by the \r\nmore developed countries.\r\nAs those present know, our economy is extremely \r\nvulnerable, as it depends on official development \r\nassistance to meet almost 90 per cent of its needs. In \r\nthe context of international financial containment, it \r\nbecomes necessary to consider and design alternative \r\nways of addressing that complex situation. It was \r\nwith that in mind that the current Government of Sao \r\nTome and Principe decided to implement an ambitious \r\nagenda of transformation for the 2030 horizon. It is \r\nfundamentally aimed at changing the paradigm of \r\ngrowth and economic and social development policies, \r\nwith a strategic focus on the private sector of our \r\neconomy. The new strategic direction, as reflected in its \r\nguidelines, is in perfect harmony with the aspirations \r\nof both the Sustainable Development Goals and the \r\nAfrican Union Agenda 2063. We believe in its success \r\nand have the necessary ambition, but we will not be \r\nable to achieve it without the strong support of our \r\ntraditional partners and the international community.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to remind the Assembly \r\nthat, based on the recognition of the One China \r\nprinciple, the Government of the Democratic Republic \r\nof Sao Tome and Principe re-established diplomatic \r\nties with the People’s Republic of China late last year. \r\nWe are certain that this decision will help to strengthen \r\nour strategic partnership, and we hope that China will \r\naccompany us on the difficult path to development that \r\nwe have proposed with our transformation agenda 2030.\r\nIn addition, we support the development efforts of \r\nCuba’s friendly population and wish to reiterate our call \r\nfor further efforts to normalize its relations with the \r\nUnited States of America so that it will act as soon as \r\npossible to lift the embargo that for decades has been an \r\nobstacle to Cuba’s progress.\r\nIn an era of proliferating technological means at \r\nthe disposal of humankind, our increasingly attentive \r\nand informed societies demand a renewed effort to \r\naccomplish the noble mission of our Organization. \r\nLet us therefore seek inspiration in its founding \r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n14/24 17-29591\r\nprinciples, the quest for the peaceful resolution of \r\nconflicts, humanitarian support for all those in need, \r\nthe promotion of inclusive and constructive dialogue, \r\nthe protection of our ecosystem and the promotion \r\nand guarantee of human rights, which are vital for the \r\nharmonious development of our nations.\r\nThe Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe \r\nwill continue to fight for such ideals, joining forces and \r\nwillpower for its materialization.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and \r\nPrincipe for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Evaristo do Espirito Santo Carvalho, \r\nPresident of the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome \r\nand Principe, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nMr. Shava (Zimbabwe), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nAddress by Mr. Robert Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe.\r\nMr. Robert Mugabe, President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the United \r\nNations His Excellency Mr. Robert Mugabe, President \r\nof the Republic of Zimbabwe, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Mugabe: I wish to congratulate \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nI also thank his predecessor, Mr. Thomson, for \r\nhis commitment to and efforts in accelerating the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nThe President could not have chosen a better or \r\nmore relevant theme for this session, given the times \r\nthat we are living in, for the pursuit and maintenance of \r\npeace and the promotion of development, in solidarity, \r\nlie at the core of the mission of the United Nations and \r\nits entire system. Since the signing of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations 72 years ago, and in subsequent \r\nconventions, resolutions and declarations adopted over \r\nthe decades, Member States have sought to actualize \r\nthe unquenchable human hope for peace, justice \r\nand progress.\r\nHowever, the current global development agenda \r\ndiffers in significant ways from all of those that preceded \r\nit. It is ambitious, revolutionary, transformative and \r\nuniversal, and it encompasses every single facet of \r\nhuman life. For its success, the agenda demands a \r\nradical, unprecedented paradigm shift in every sphere \r\nof human life.\r\nWe cannot halt or reverse the continued destruction \r\nof our natural habitat or the rise in global atmospheric \r\ntemperature without a change in contemporary \r\nproduction and consumption patterns. That has been \r\nconfirmed by scientific evidence. We cannot halt \r\nor reverse the persistent, widening gap between the \r\nrich and the poor among our nations without deeper \r\ninternational cooperation and a genuine reform of the \r\nexisting inequitable international system. The current \r\nsystem is inherently structured to enrich a few and \r\nimpoverish the many. Therefore, it cannot deliver on \r\na key aspiration, watchword and objective of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development — that of leaving \r\nno one behind.\r\nFor us in Africa, the current antiquated system \r\nperpetuates a historic injustice — one that can never be \r\njustified today. The 2030 Agenda represents new wine, \r\nand we call for a new wineskin, lest we ruin the new \r\nwine. It is for that reason that I reiterate my country’s \r\nunflinching support for the African Common Position \r\non Security Council reform, commonly known as the \r\nEzulwini Consensus.\r\nThe overwhelming majority of us have accepted \r\nthat we need to reform the current system in order to \r\nimprove, but not destroy it. Nonetheless, the negotiations \r\nand process intended to yield the accepted reforms are \r\npainstakingly slow. We are left to wonder, justifiably \r\nso, whether those who enjoy and sometimes abuse the \r\npower and privileges of the current set-up are sincere \r\ninterlocutors in those discussions.\r\nIt is axiomatic that we harvest what we sow, yet by \r\nsome strange logic we expect to reap peace when we \r\ninvest and expend so much, in treasure and technology, \r\nin war. According to the Stockholm International \r\nPeace Research Institute, global military expenditure \r\nin 2016 amounted to approximately $1.6 trillion. In \r\nthe same year, according to the Organization for \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 15/24\r\nEconomic Cooperation and Development, overseas \r\ndevelopment assistance amounted to approximately \r\n$142.6 billion. Those mega investments in ever more \r\nlethal weapons and more sophisticated war machinery \r\nhave not resulted in greater peace or security. Instead, \r\nwe have witnessed heart-rending suffering and misery \r\nand increased mass movements of people f leeing wars \r\nand armed conflicts. That trend should be halted for the \r\nbenefit of humankind.\r\nWe believe that a different and better world \r\nis possible. In proposing and inviting us to focus \r\non prevention, preventive diplomacy, the peaceful \r\nresolution of conflicts, peacebuilding and sustaining \r\npeace, the Secretary-General is pointing us in that \r\ndesirable direction. We must also seriously tackle \r\nthe multifaceted and complex root causes of conflict, \r\nincluding enduring poverty and deprivation, unequal \r\naccess to resources, the denial of the right to self-\r\ndetermination of peoples, and interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other States, among other causes.\r\nThe continued denial of the right to self-\r\ndetermination to the peoples of Western Sahara and \r\nPalestine, who are living under colonial and foreign \r\noccupation, is immoral and an urgent issue for those \r\nseeking peace and security in our time. The Security \r\nCouncil has assumed its responsibilities, as set forth \r\nin the Charter of the United Nations, and adopted \r\nnumerous resolutions. What remains is the enforcement \r\nand implementation of those resolutions.\r\nWe call on the Security Council to demonstrate its \r\nauthority by ensuring the holding, without much further \r\ndelay, of the independence referendum in Western \r\nSahara. We expect the Security Council to work closely \r\nwith the African Union — its proven partner for peace \r\non the African continent — in that effort. The ever-\r\ndeteriorating situation and continued suffering of the \r\nPalestinian people should spur the Security Council to \r\nrenewed, time-framed efforts to bring about the two-\r\nState solution already defined in numerous General \r\nAssembly and Security Council resolutions.\r\nDevelopment and peace are conjoined and cannot \r\nbe separated. My country has embraced the 2030 \r\nAgenda as an integrated and comprehensive approach \r\nto address the myriad and complex national and global \r\nchallenges, in solidarity and in cooperation with other \r\nstakeholders. Zimbabwe was honoured to be among \r\nsome other 40-plus countries that participated in \r\nthe voluntary national review at the 2017 high-level \r\npolitical forum in July.\r\nWe were and still are pleased to share with \r\nother countries our experiences and to learn from \r\nothers about their experiences in implementing the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. We recognize the need \r\nfor beneficial partnerships, both within and outside our \r\nnational borders. One of our key partners is the United \r\nNations system, with which, I am happy to note, we \r\nwork very closely. I wish in that regard to welcome the \r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to ensure that the support \r\nof United Nations country teams will be guided by \r\nnational priorities. That will ensure national ownership \r\nand leadership of development processes, as well as the \r\nsustainability of development projects and programmes. \r\nThat is what we are experiencing in Zimbabwe.\r\nMy country is an unflinching advocate of respect \r\nfor the sovereignty and independence of countries. We \r\ntherefore strongly defend and respect the right of each \r\ncountry to take decisions in exercising its sovereign \r\nrights. We cannot, however, remain silent when those \r\ndecisions impact or have the potential to negatively \r\naffect our own welfare. And to that end, may I say that \r\nsome of us were embarrassed, if not frightened by what \r\nappeared to be the return of the biblical giant Goliath.\r\nAre we experiencing the return of a Goliath in our \r\nmidst that threatens the extinction of all countries? May \r\nI say to the United States President, Mr. Trump, that he \r\nplease blow his trumpet in a musical way towards the \r\nvalues of unity, peace, cooperation, togetherness and \r\ndialogue, for which we have always stood and that are \r\nenshrined in our very sacred document, the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. Upon those values each nation, \r\nincluding the United States, can build its greatness. And \r\nit is the greatness in recognizing those values of unity, \r\npeace, cooperation, dialogue and togetherness that we \r\nwould want to be guided by the United States, and not \r\nby the promise of our damnation. We shall always resist \r\ndamnation, no matter whence it comes. We resisted it \r\nwhen it was in the form of imperialism as we fought for \r\nour own independence, our own culture and our own \r\nsovereignty, and to be masters of our own destiny. That \r\nis why we call ourselves free today. It is because the \r\nmonster of imperialism was defeated by us. Bring us \r\nanother monster, by whatever name, and it will suffer \r\nthe same consequences.\r\nClimate change is a present reality and so are its \r\neffects and impacts. Climate change is global. We \r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n16/24 17-29591\r\ncannot remain silent when a major world economic \r\nPower, or any other State for that matter, decides to \r\nabandon the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, \r\nas Mr. Trump’s great United States has done. Let us \r\nwork together. Climate change is a reality. It is vital \r\nthat we all play our part, in keeping with the provisions \r\nof the United Nations Framework Convention on \r\nClimate Change, in order to halt the inexorable march \r\ntowards the destruction of that on which our own \r\nexistence depends.\r\nOn behalf of my country, I want to express our \r\ncondolences to Puerto Rico and to countries that have \r\nsuffered aff lictions. There are many in this part of the \r\nworld. We say that we are very sorry and we appeal to \r\nthe rest of us, who have not suffered similar aff lictions, \r\nto assist those who have suffered in such a horrific \r\nmanner. I ask anyone here to watch television today \r\nand tell me whether they know where Puerto Rico is \r\ngeographically. It has been completely wiped out by a \r\nhurricane. We are very sorry.\r\nAs I conclude my remarks, it is worth reminding \r\none another that the world today, by its very \r\ninterconnectedness, demands more, not less, solidarity; \r\nmore, not less, cooperation and dialogue; more, not \r\nless, multilateralism. We have brought more and more \r\nissues under the global agenda and within global \r\ndiscourse. That acknowledgement has found expression \r\nin the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and in \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals. Our survival and \r\nprogress calls for reinforced solidarity, partnerships and \r\ncooperation and for development in unity, cooperation \r\nand peace. That is a call to which we must all respond \r\npositively and actively. Zimbabwe is already doing so.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the Republic \r\nof Zimbabwe for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Robert Gabriel Mugabe, President of the \r\nRepublic of Zimbabwe, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Indonesia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof Indonesia.\r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Muhammad Kalla, \r\nVice-President of the Republic of Indonesia, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Kalla (Indonesia): Allow me to begin by \r\nwishing a happy new year to those who celebrate the \r\nIslamic New Year 1439 Hijri. May peace be upon us all.\r\nI would also like to extend Indonesia’s deep \r\nsympathy with and condolences to those affected by \r\nthe recent natural disasters, including the earthquake \r\nin Mexico, the hurricanes in the Caribbean and parts \r\nof the United States, as well as f loods in South Asia \r\nand other parts of the world. Our prayers go out to all \r\nthe victims.\r\nMay I congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session. Indonesia is committed to \r\ncontributing to his successful presidency. I would also \r\nlike to thank His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji \r\nfor his able stewardship as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session. We commend \r\nhis role in driving a universal push for the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs).\r\nWe are all represented on the same world map, yet \r\nwe see many different worlds. Our world today is far \r\nfrom equitable. The peoples of our world experience \r\nwar, hunger, extreme poverty and illiteracy. Peace and \r\nequal prosperity are far from being reached. Therefore, \r\nIndonesia welcomes the theme of this year’s session, \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent life \r\nfor all on a sustainable planet”. The theme recognizes \r\nthe importance of placing the needs of our peoples \r\nfirst and highlights the fact that peace, prosperity, and \r\nsustainability are mutually reinforcing. In that context, \r\nI wish to underline three important points for achieving \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet.\r\nFirst, it must be underlined that peace is never \r\ngiven; rather, it has to be developed and nurtured. We \r\nmust work towards creating a global ecosystem of peace \r\nand stability. Indonesia’s experience in the Association \r\nof Southeast Asian Nations shows that building such \r\nan ecosystem is fundamental. It is fundamental for \r\neconomic development and fundamental for the \r\nprosperity of the people.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 17/24\r\nIndonesia firmly believes that developing a global \r\necosystem of peace and stability is doable. However, \r\nto succeed we must practice the habits of dialogue, \r\ninclusiveness, the peaceful settlement of disputes \r\nand the non-use of force. More importantly, we must \r\ndevelop the United Nations as a robust global institution \r\nthat emphasizes the maintenance of peace, security \r\nand stability. Key to that is ensuring that the United \r\nNations reform process results in a strong, effective \r\nand relevant United Nations. It was for that reason that \r\nIndonesia co-sponsored the declaration of support for \r\nUnited Nations reform.\r\nFurthermore, we must also strengthen international \r\npeacekeeping and peacebuilding mechanisms. \r\nIndonesia is honoured to have played a part in \r\nmediating conflicts, peacekeeping and peacebuilding \r\nbeyond our borders. We have been and will always be \r\nready to be a part of a global solution. Over the past 60 \r\nyears, we have contributed more than 38,000 personnel \r\nto 28 United Nations peacekeeping operations. We \r\ncurrently deploy more than 2,700 peacekeepers in \r\nnine peacekeeping missions. We are also determined \r\nto contribute 4,000 personnel by 2019 and increase the \r\nnumber of female peacekeepers.\r\nBeyond peacekeeping, Indonesia is an active \r\nmember of the Peacebuilding Commission. We underline \r\nthe need to ensure sustainable peace at the global level, \r\nwhich requires a global culture of prevention. It is also \r\nimportant to ensure a strong partnership among the \r\nUnited Nations, the relevant regional organizations and \r\nnational Governments.\r\nA global ecosystem of peace and stability requires \r\nthe international community to settle one of the longest-\r\nstanding unresolved conflicts — that of Palestine and \r\nIsrael. This year marks half a century of the illegal \r\noccupation of Palestine. We shall not give up. Palestine \r\nis at the heart of Indonesian foreign policy, and \r\nIndonesia will continue to support it. After 50 years \r\nof stalemate, we need a fresh approach — one that is \r\nsustainable and innovative and can bring about a two-\r\nState solution.\r\nWe must not stop with the attainment of sustainable \r\npeace. A decent life for all people must be our global \r\ngoal. That leads me to my second point. There must be \r\nsynergies between sustaining peace and the development \r\nagenda. We must cultivate peace and stability to work \r\nfor us in achieving sustainable development. The \r\ninternational system is well equipped to attain a decent \r\nlife for all. A number of global commitments have been \r\nagreed, including the SDGs and the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, to name but two.\r\nHowever, commitments must be translated into \r\nconcrete actions. The key to that is the means of \r\nimplementation for the least developed and developing \r\ncountries. Adequate funding, technical assistance, \r\ncapacity-building and the transfer of technology are \r\nimportant elements for success. It is also important to \r\nsupport regions with huge potential that have undertaken \r\ngreat reforms towards sustainable development.\r\nAfrica is one such region. For Indonesia, South-\r\nSouth and triangular cooperation is our way to support \r\ndevelopment in the least developed and developing \r\ncountries. Over the past three years, we have \r\norganized 167 South-South and triangular cooperation \r\nprogrammes, from which more than 2,000 participants \r\nfrom the least developed and developing countries \r\nhave benefited. Indonesia is also proud to host the first \r\nIndonesia-Africa Forum in April of 2018, which shows \r\nour commitment to strengthening a partnership with \r\nAfrica towards achieving sustainable development.\r\nSynergy between sustaining peace and the \r\ndevelopment agenda requires a society that is just \r\nand inclusive and fully respects human rights. There \r\nshould be no more man-made humanitarian crises \r\nin the world. Indonesia shares the concern of the \r\ninternational community regarding the developments \r\nin Rakhine state. We have proposed a 4+1 formula \r\nto the Government of Myanmar, placing the needs \r\nand welfare of the people at its centre. It would first \r\nrequire restoring stability and security. Its second \r\ntenet is restraint and non-violence. Third is to provide \r\nprotection to all people in Rakhine state. Fourth is \r\nimmediate access to humanitarian assistance. We also \r\nwish to implement the recommendations of the team \r\nled by Kofi Annan.\r\nThat is why a people-centred Government must be \r\nat the heart of national development programmes. That \r\nis why Indonesia continues to strengthen democracy \r\nand good governance at all levels. Over the past 10 \r\nyears, through the Bali Democracy Forum, Indonesia \r\nhas also shared the experiences and best practices of \r\nits democracy, working to strengthen democracy in its \r\nwider region.\r\nFurthermore, development must not be achieved at \r\nthe expense of the environment. Despite the sceptics, \r\nclimate change is real. It is happening as we speak. Like \r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n18/24 17-29591\r\nmany small island developing States, Indonesia, with \r\nmore than 17,000 islands, is experiencing changing \r\nweather patterns and rising sea levels. That will affect \r\nthe sustainability of our development and even our \r\nsurvival. Indonesia is therefore fully committed to the \r\nParis Agreement. We call on all countries to implement \r\ntheir obligations under the Agreement.\r\nOne of the greatest challenges to our global order \r\nand development agenda is the threat of terrorism, \r\nradicalism and violent extremism. The threat is real, \r\nimminent and ever-present. Terrorism undermines \r\npeace and disrupts development. Therefore, my third \r\npoint concerns the urgent need for global action and \r\npartnership in combating terrorism, radicalism and \r\nviolent extremism. The key to tackling terrorism is to \r\naddress its root causes: extreme poverty, illiteracy and \r\nmassive youth unemployment. In most cases, radicalism \r\nand terrorism take hold of young, angry men, who think \r\nthey have no hope because their country is destroyed, \r\nin combination with authoritarian Governments and \r\ninvasions of big countries.\r\nIn Indonesia, we have adopted a comprehensive \r\napproach to addressing terrorism, radicalism and \r\nviolent extremism in the form of a seamless combination \r\nof using hard and soft powers and strengthening law \r\nenforcement and the rule of law. At the same time, \r\nwe are fostering engagement with communities \r\nthrough education, empowerment and interfaith and \r\ncultural dialogue. Indonesia has also implemented a \r\ncomprehensive programme for the deradicalization \r\nand reintegration of those who have been radicalized \r\nor gone to the dark side. We have deradicalized more \r\nthan 1,600 extremists in over 72 prisons in Indonesia. \r\nIn this digital age of social media, terrorism is like \r\ncancer; it spreads quickly and it is deadly. No one \r\ncountry can address it in isolation. Global cooperation \r\nand a comprehensive approach are the only panacea to \r\neradicate the threat.\r\nAs global challenges become more complex, it is \r\nevident that unilateralism is not a sustainable solution. \r\nThe world needs strong partnership — a true global \r\npartnership. Indonesia has long believed in such \r\npartnership. That belief stems from our embedded \r\nnational slogan “Bersatu kita teguh bercerai kita \r\nruntuh”, which translates as “united we stand, divided \r\nwe fall”. Indonesia has always desired to contribute \r\nto global partnership, global peace and security, and \r\nglobal prosperity. Indonesia has presented its candidacy \r\nfor non-permanent membership of the Security Council \r\nfor the term 2019-2020. Indonesia is a true partner for \r\nworld peace. We are counting on the support of those \r\npresent for our candidacy.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Vice-President of the \r\nRepublic of Indonesia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Muhammad Jusuf Kalla, Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of Indonesia, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by His Royal Highness Crown Prince \r\nAl Hussein bin Abdullah II, Crown Prince of \r\nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by His Royal Highness Crown Prince \r\nAl Hussein bin Abdullah II, Crown Prince of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\r\nCrown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II, Crown \r\nPrince of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Royal Highness Crown Prince \r\nAl Hussein bin Abdullah II, Crown Prince of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nCrown Prince Abdullah II: I am honoured today \r\nto speak on behalf of His Majesty King Abdullah II \r\nand the people of Jordan. I bring Jordan’s sincere \r\ncongratulations on the election of President Lajcák and \r\nour commitment to the work of the General Assembly. \r\nTo Secretary-General Guterres, I extend my country’s \r\ngreat appreciation for his partnership with our people.\r\nTwo years ago, I had the chance to advocate on \r\nbehalf of my generation and to chair a delegation that \r\nparticipated in the work leading to the adoption of the \r\nfirst Security Council resolution on youth. Our joint \r\nefforts resulted in the historic, unanimous adoption of \r\nresolution 2250 (2015), on youth, peace and security, \r\naimed at empowering young people to participate in \r\npeace processes and dispute resolution.\r\nToday, I stand before the Assembly not only as \r\na representative of my beloved Jordan, but also as a \r\nmember of the largest generation of young people in \r\nhistory. Like every other generation, we have inherited \r\nthe collective wisdom and values of our elders. \r\nAnd like others before us, we must often struggle to \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 19/24\r\nreconcile them with our reality today. What that reality \r\nis is unprecedented.\r\nOurs is a world at an epic intersection, driven \r\nby the confluence of deepened globalization and \r\ndisruptive technologies. We are at the brink of a fourth \r\nindustrial revolution that is redefining how we function \r\nas societies and how we relate to one another as human \r\nbeings. Our hyperconnected world is at once bringing \r\npeople closer together and widening the divisions \r\namong them.\r\nAmid all that, the young people of my generation \r\nare asking: what are the values that anchor global \r\ncitizenship today? In which direction does our collective \r\nmoral compass point, and can it guide us safely to \r\njustice, prosperity and peace for all? Too often, people \r\nof my generation are labelled dreamers, yet we all know \r\nthat every great deed was born a dream. We are often \r\ndismissed as idealists, but idealism is not foolish; it is \r\nfearless. It invigorates us to lift our reality to the level \r\nof our higher ideals, and not to compromise our ideals \r\nin the face of adversity.\r\nSo I humbly ask those present to indulge me as I \r\ntry, on behalf of my generation, to sharpen the contours \r\nof our foggy terrain and put forward some rudimentary \r\nquestions that are unfettered by the political decorum \r\nthat I know I will acquire with time. I will use my \r\ncountry, Jordan, as a launchpad for those thoughts and \r\nquestions, as I believe they are a true embodiment of \r\nwhat is so right and yet so wrong with our world today.\r\nThroughout its history, Jordan has suffered \r\nexternal shock after external shock, but the past couple \r\nof decades have been relentless. We are currently \r\nbordered by a number of conflicts. Over the years, \r\nthere have been wars in Gaza, Iraq, Syria, Libya and \r\nYemen, and there are worsening prospects for peace in \r\nthe Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Jordan has also had to \r\nweather the global financial crisis and the energy crises.\r\nAll that has affected us in very real and felt ways. \r\nOur largest export market, Iraq, was completely shut \r\noff. Trade with Syria came to a halt, and we lost critical \r\ntrade routes from Europe and Turkey. Despite our best \r\nefforts, regional instability has undermined tourism \r\nand investment. I do not know of any other country in \r\nrecent history that has gone through such an onslaught \r\nof crises and found itself surrounded by so many \r\nconflicts through no fault of its own.\r\nAnd it does not stop there. My country — a \r\nresource-poor nation in a conflict-rich region — is host \r\nto 1.3 million Syrian refugees, in addition to millions \r\nof Palestinian refugees and hundreds of thousands of \r\nIraqis, as well as others from Libya and Yemen. Jordan \r\ntoday is one of the largest hosts of refugees in the \r\nworld. The direct cost of the Syria crisis now consumes \r\nmore than a quarter of our budget. Its ripple effects \r\nare felt across local communities, where 90 per cent \r\nof Syrian refugees live. Housing, food, energy, health \r\ncare, education and jobs are all under pressure.\r\nYet in the face of those daunting challenges, we did \r\nnot back down from our ideals or values. We did not turn \r\nour backs on people in need. We are weighed down by \r\nmassive debt, yet we stand tall and proud. Our soldiers \r\ndodge bullets to let refugees into our country, not to \r\nkeep them out. Nor did we falter in our reform efforts, \r\ndifficult as some of them have been on our people. On \r\nthe contrary, the heavier our burden became, the more \r\nforcefully we forged ahead.\r\nPlease do not misunderstand me; we are not \r\nperfect. To bring down unemployment and create the \r\njobs needed for youth and future generations, we need \r\nto drastically improve our investment climate; enhance \r\nintegrity and accountability; advance our education \r\nsystem; and support young entrepreneurs. Ordinarily, \r\nassistance would be tied to our progress. But these are \r\nextraordinary times, and aid is a necessary runway if \r\nour political and economic reforms are to fully take off.\r\nDifficult circumstances did not stop Jordan from \r\nbeing a net contributor to global good. We have \r\nremained steadfast in our commitment to a just and \r\npeaceful resolution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict \r\nbased on the two-State solution, despite prevailing \r\nscepticism. We have staunchly upheld our duty as \r\nHashemite custodians of Muslim and Christian holy \r\nsites in Jerusalem. Preserving the historical and legal \r\nstatus quo at Al-Aqsa Mosque/Haram al-Sharif is key \r\nto peace in our region and the world, as Jerusalem is the \r\ncradle of all three monotheistic religions.\r\nWe have been unwavering in the international war \r\nagainst terrorism and our promotion of the true values \r\nof Islam. Our peacekeeping troops have protected \r\ninnocent civilians from Haiti to Darfur to East Timor; \r\nand our calls for inclusiveness and moderation ring \r\nloud in a region too often deafened by division and \r\nextremism. We have done the right thing, over and over \r\nagain, because that is what real integrity means.\r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n20/24 17-29591\r\nBut how has the world reacted? No doubt, Jordan \r\nis regularly praised for its humanitarian and moral \r\nstance, and we are proud of our country’s reputation. \r\nBut kind words do not balance budgets, build schools \r\nor bolster employment. For the people and youth of \r\nJordan, important questions linger. How can it be that \r\na country as small as ours struggles in the face of such \r\ncrushing adversity, only to be told that its friends are \r\nsuffering from donor fatigue? Financial institutions \r\noften remind us that on a per capita basis, we are a top \r\nrecipient of aid. Yet, on a per capita basis, few countries \r\nhave endured as many external shocks or contributed to \r\nglobal peace and security as Jordan has.\r\nHow can it be that a country like Jordan offers \r\na humble home to millions of desperate people, \r\nwhile richer countries around the world quibble over \r\naccepting thousands? What does it say about our \r\ncommon humanity when last year alone the world spent \r\nclose to $1.7 trillion on arms, but fell short by less than \r\n$1.7 billion in fulfilling the United Nations appeal \r\nto support Syrian refugees and host communities in \r\ncountries like Jordan? What does it say when trillions \r\nare spent waging wars in our region, but little to take \r\nour region to safer shores?\r\nThere are no good answers. The sad reality is that \r\nwar economies are thriving to the benefit of a few, while \r\nreal economies are suffering to the detriment of all. The \r\nmessage to the youth of Jordan and our region is loud \r\nand clear: there is no shortage of money for fighting \r\nevil, but the appetite for rewarding virtue is nearly \r\nnon-existent; that the voice of those who defend and \r\nbuild is drowned out by those who attack and destroy. \r\nIt just does not add up. So, what do we tell the people of \r\nJordan? What does the international community tell our \r\nyoung majority? Do we tell them that the values we live \r\nby are of no value? That pragmatism beats principles? \r\nThat complacency trumps compassion? Or that we \r\nshould play it safe; turn our backs on people in need, \r\nbecause we cannot count on others to have our back?\r\nThe United Nations is our global conscience, \r\nbut for too many in my country, and others around \r\nthe world trying to do good, it sometimes feels like \r\nthe world’s conscience is on silent mode. It is time to \r\nbreak the silence and start finding answers. In doing \r\nso, we can unleash a global current that carries our \r\ncommon humanity to safer shores. Our commitment \r\nto peace, moderation and international cooperation is \r\nuncompromising. Water a thirsty fruit-bearing tree or \r\ncontinue to add fuel to a raging fire? The world has a \r\nchoice to make.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Crown Prince of the \r\nHashemite Kingdom of Jordan for the statement he \r\njust made.\r\nCrown Prince Al Hussein bin Abdullah II, Crown \r\nPrince of the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime \r\nMinister of Tuvalu\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of Tuvalu.\r\nMr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister of \r\nTuvalu, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, \r\nPrime Minister of Tuvalu, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Sopoaga (Tuvalu): Next week, on 1 October, \r\nTuvalu will mark the thirty-ninth anniversary of its \r\nindependence. It gives me great pleasure, therefore, \r\non behalf of the Government and people of Tuvalu, to \r\nthank the United Nations and all its membership for \r\ngranting Tuvalu the recognition of full sovereignty in \r\nOctober 1978.\r\nTwenty-two years later, on the eve of the twenty-\r\nfirst century in September 2000, Tuvalu was admitted \r\nas the 189th Member of the United Nations, with the \r\nrights of full participation as a member of the United \r\nNations family. Our joining the United Nations is a \r\njourney of hope — hope in the noble values of this \r\ngreat body, the United Nations, and trust in its ability \r\nto assure humankind, including small and vulnerable \r\ncountries like mine, peace, security and prosperity for \r\nour survival.\r\nI record Tuvalu’s sincere gratitude to the United \r\nNations and its specialized agencies, development \r\npartners — especially our traditional partners in the \r\nPacific, regional bodies of the Pacific — friends in \r\nAsia, India, South Korea, Japan, the Republic of China, \r\nthe European Union and others, for all their support to \r\nmy island nation of Tuvalu. We welcome the friendship \r\nand partnership of United Nations Members and other \r\nentities as we move forward.\r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 21/24\r\nTuvalu applauds the theme of the seventy-second \r\ngeneral debate, “Focusing on people: Striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. \r\nIt captures the undeniable linkage between peace, \r\nsecurity and sustainable development. It underscores \r\nthat, without peace and security, our 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development will not deliver a fair \r\nglobalization for all. In short, without sustainable \r\ndevelopment, there will be no peace and no security.\r\nI congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election \r\nto the presidency and on his vision of focusing on \r\npeople during the seventy-second session. I also \r\ncongratulate the outgoing President of the General \r\nAssembly, Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji, on his efforts and \r\noutstanding leadership on many fronts.\r\nI want to express the deepest sympathy of Tuvalu, \r\nas a small and vulnerable island nation, to the people \r\nof the United States of America and the Caribbean \r\nislands who are suffering or have been affected by the \r\ndestruction caused by the recent hurricanes and tropical \r\ncyclones in that region. These unfortunate events clearly \r\nshow the magnitude and urgency of global work still \r\nrequired of the United Nations to better prepare, protect \r\nand save peoples and humanity from such calamities.\r\nWe also share the devastating grief of the people of \r\nMexico, including young schoolchildren, following the \r\nearthquake this week, as well as other peoples suffering \r\nsimilar disasters and violence around the world. We \r\npray that God brings comfort and a speedy recovery to \r\nthe affected people and their loved ones.\r\nHorrific acts of violence and terrorism continue \r\nto plague our world. Countless innocent lives are \r\ndestroyed and lost. Violence in any form is a direct \r\nthreat to peace and security and seriously undermines \r\nour efforts to achieve sustainable development. We \r\ntherefore condemn violence and terrorism in all their \r\nforms and manifestations.\r\nWe are particularly concerned with the threat to \r\nglobal peace and security posed by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. We acknowledge the \r\npersistent efforts of the Security Council to de-escalate \r\ntensions. A renewed engagement with inclusive \r\ndiplomatic dialogue is, in our view, the only option for \r\nsolving the crisis on the Korean peninsula. We believe \r\nthat a military response would lead to unimaginable \r\ndestruction and loss of life.\r\nIn this vein, Tuvalu maintains its commitments in \r\nsupport of all international legal instruments against \r\nviolence and terrorism. It is critical that we support \r\ninternational law for the protection and promotion of \r\nhuman rights. We commend the establishment of the \r\nOffice of Counter-Terrorism to ensure the effective and \r\nbalanced implementation of the United Nations Global \r\nCounter-Terrorism Strategy.\r\nJust yesterday, and with pride on behalf of my \r\ncountry, Tuvalu, I signed the Treaty on the Prohibition \r\nof Nuclear Weapons as a further demonstration of our \r\ncommitment to the elimination of nuclear weapons \r\nand to the South Pacific Nuclear-Free-Zone Treaty, \r\nwhich was negotiated and drafted at the 1984 Pacific \r\nIsland Leaders Forum, held in Tuvalu. It is our fervent \r\nhope that nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction, including the trade in materials and the \r\ndevelopment of technologies to produce such weapons, \r\nare totally banned, outlawed and prohibited worldwide \r\nby the United Nations. Humankind must be advanced \r\nneither on the principles of fear and deterrence nor \r\non the adage of “might is right”, but rather on moral \r\njustice for humankind, equity, trust, respect and the \r\nfull enjoyment of basic human rights.\r\nThe entry into force of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change last year raised our hopes \r\nthat, in recognizing the existential threat to us all, \r\nMember States would commit to the common cause \r\nof fighting climate change, adapting to its impacts \r\nand strengthening the ability of developing States, \r\nespecially the most vulnerable, to deal with them. The \r\nParis Agreement is our common hope of a decent life \r\non a sustainable planet. For Tuvalu, it is our hope of \r\nsecurity and survival.\r\nThis hope, however, dimmed with the announcement \r\nby the United States that it will abandon the Paris \r\nAgreement. This decision risks undermining our global \r\nefforts to save and protect the livelihoods of the people \r\nwho are at risk from the impacts of climate change. \r\nThese are the marginalized, the vulnerable, the poor, \r\nthe women and the children who suffer the most from \r\nclimate change, especially those who live on low-lying \r\nislands and incoastal areas. There are already tens of \r\nmillions of these people, and their number is increasing \r\nat an alarming rate.\r\nDomestic, economic and political interests are \r\noften short-term and benefit only a few. They should \r\nnot be pursued at the expense of a decent life for us \r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n22/24 17-29591\r\nall, current and future generations, on a sustainable \r\nplanet. That is the spirit that underpins our twenty-\r\nfirst-century development system. We therefore urge \r\nthe United States to reunite with us and to allow all \r\nof us, in particular the most vulnerable, the best \r\npossible chance to save ourselves and the sustainable \r\nfuture of humankind. We are nevertheless encouraged \r\nthis morning by the strong leadership of Canadian \r\nPrime Minister Justin Trudeau and French President \r\nEmmanuel Macron on climate change. We thank them \r\nand highly commend their courage.\r\nWe welcome the Secretary-General’s intention to \r\nconvene a dedicated climate summit in 2019 to mobilize \r\npolitical support. It will be an important opportunity, in \r\nour view, to review our progress and momentum and, \r\nmost importantly, to enhance our commitment to taking \r\nurgent and credible actions to reverse global warming. \r\nWe are also encouraged by the Secretary-General’s \r\ncommitment to intensifying high-level political \r\nengagement to limit the temperature rise to well below \r\n2°C above pre-industrial levels and aiming at limiting \r\nthe increase to 1.5°C. We are likewise heartened by \r\nhis dedication to rallying the United Nations system to \r\nbetter support Member States by mobilizing resources \r\nand strengthening partnerships in their pursuit of \r\nclimate action.\r\nIndeed, without enhanced commitment and genuine \r\npartnerships, the Paris Agreement will not save us all, \r\nespecially the most vulnerable. Climate change is a risk \r\nmultiplier on all factors of development. Its challenges \r\nare complex and continue to change. It is for this reason \r\nthat we reiterate our call for the appointment of a \r\nspecial representative on climate change and security \r\nin order to enhance international focus, coordination \r\nand commitment. In the same vein, we call for climate \r\nchange and security to be a permanent item on the \r\nagenda of the Security Council, given its direct threat \r\nto global peace and security.\r\nFor Tuvalu and many of the low-lying islands, our \r\npeace and security are not imperilled by traditional \r\nthreats of conflict, violence, drugs, weapons, famine or \r\ndisease. Instead, as the Male’ Declaration on the Human \r\nDimension of Climate Change recognized in 2007, “the \r\nimpacts of climate change pose the most immediate, \r\nfundamental and far-reaching threat” to individuals \r\nand communities in these most vulnerable States and \r\nthreaten a wide range of human rights, including\r\n“the right to life, the right to take part in cultural \r\nlife, the right to use and enjoy property, the right \r\nto an adequate standard of living, the right to food \r\nand the right to the highest attainable standard of \r\nphysical and mental health”.\r\nTen years ago we recognized that climate change \r\nwas the single greatest major threat to our peace, \r\nsecurity and, ultimately, survival. It remains so today, \r\nand the situation grows more urgent every day. Under \r\ncurrent warming trends, our islands may be submerged \r\nunder the sea within the next 50 years. If and when that \r\nhappens, we will be forced to abandon our islands, even \r\nthough we contribute the least to global warming and \r\nsea-level rise. This forced relocation or displacement of \r\nour people is an injustice and an infringement on our \r\nfundamental and basic human rights.\r\nIt is for this very reason that we continue to call for \r\nenhanced global commitment and partnerships in the \r\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement. We cannot give \r\nup on this campaign, for two very simple reasons. First, \r\nrelocation and statelessness are totally unacceptable, \r\nas many of us here in the Hall would agree. Secondly, \r\nwe all know that membership of our global family of \r\nthe United Nations has the tools and resources to save \r\nTuvalu and low-lying States from the impacts of climate \r\nchange. It is only a question of whether we have the will \r\nand the courage to help these people.\r\nWe have come together to face grave risks before. \r\nOver many years, the international community, guided \r\nby the Charter of the United Nations, has cooperated on \r\nmany fronts to deal with threats such as Ebola, cholera, \r\nviolence, natural disasters and, subsequently, the lives \r\nand rights of people displaced by such threats. The \r\ninternational response was immediate because these \r\nthreats were potential global threats to humankind. For \r\nothers, however, their response was driven by political \r\nand economic interests. Sadly, displacement owing to \r\nthe impacts of climate change has not drawn the same \r\ninternational concern and response, despite the fact that \r\nit has the very real potential to become a serious threat \r\nto global peace, security and human rights.\r\nUncontrolled mass migration into Europe as a \r\nresult of conflicts and natural disasters, for example, \r\nhas taught us the very important lesson that we should \r\nhave had in place effective international institutions \r\nand systems to control, manage and protect the rights \r\nof migrants. In exactly the same manner, we must now \r\nformulate effective international systems to protect \r\n21/09/2017 A/72/PV.13\r\n17-29591 23/24\r\nthe human rights of people displaced by the impacts \r\nof climate change and avoid further uncontrolled mass \r\nmigration and mass violation of human rights.\r\nThis preparation must include developing the \r\nappropriate international legal tools to cope with the \r\ncomplex and multifaceted challenges posed by climate \r\nchange. In particular, the current refugee regimes that \r\nwere developed to cope with traditional threats do not \r\nadequately protect people forced to leave their homes \r\nby the impacts of climate change. We therefore reiterate \r\nour proposal for a United Nations resolution on the \r\nestablishment of a legal process to protect the human \r\nrights and, ultimately, save the lives of people displaced \r\nby the impacts of climate change.\r\nAs a least developed country (LDC) and a small \r\nisland developing State (SIDS), we need enhanced \r\nglobal support to overcome the structural challenges we \r\nface in implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. On our own part, Tuvalu has developed \r\nits national strategy for sustainable development, known \r\nas Te Kakeega III, premised on building resilience \r\nthrough good governance, inclusive participation and \r\ncapacity measures for mitigation for LDCs, with targets \r\nof 100 per cent renewable energy by 2020, as well as \r\ncoastal protection adaptation on all islands, in order to \r\nprotect and save Tuvalu.\r\nWe are grateful to the members of the international \r\ncommunity for their generous support through the work \r\nof the Green Climate Fund, the Global Environment \r\nFacility and the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme, as well as through other donors and \r\nbilateral partners. While grateful for their goodwill, \r\nwe have established our own Tuvalu Climate Change \r\nand Disaster Survival Fund as a facility to help people \r\nrespond quickly to the impacts of climate change.\r\nTo enhance further adaptation work, access to \r\nappropriate infrastructures, maritime ports on the \r\nislands, airports, technology connectivity, health care, \r\nquality education and renewable energy are critical \r\nareas of particular priority. Tuvalu will welcome the \r\ndevelopment of genuine and durable partnerships, as \r\naspired to under the SIDS Accelerated Modalities of \r\nAction Pathway.\r\nIn regard to the issue of LDC graduation, it is our \r\nview that a country must graduate only when it can \r\nachieve sustainable development, not merely when it \r\nshould be able to achieve it. The unique vulnerability \r\nof SIDS and LDCs such as Tuvalu must be the central \r\ncriteria of consideration for LDC graduation.\r\nAs small islands surrounded by vast oceans, we \r\ninteract with the ocean every day of our lives. We \r\nare heavily dependent on the ocean, and the ocean is \r\ncentral to our achievement of sustainable development. \r\nWe firmly believe that once we have established our \r\nbaselines under the United Nations Convention on \r\nthe Law of the Sea, these baselines, as well as the \r\nidentified maritime zones, shall remain forever. This is \r\nirrespective of sea-level rise.\r\nThe ongoing discussions on the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of marine biological diversity \r\nbeyond areas of national jurisdiction must ensure that \r\nsmall island developing States, with our particular \r\nvulnerabilities, are provided the necessary financial \r\nand technical support to guarantee our equal and fair \r\nparticipation in the management and sharing of benefits \r\nfrom this instrument. We must agree at this session of \r\nthe Assembly to commence work on developing a legally \r\nbinding agreement to give protection to biodiversity \r\nbeyond national jurisdictions.\r\nOur 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is \r\nuniversal and holistic in that it applies to all countries \r\nand actors and covers all aspects of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. Critically to its success, the agenda is \r\nrooted in human rights and genuine partnerships. \r\nBut the vibrant democracy of Taiwan, which has long \r\nbeen an active and responsible development partner \r\nto many countries, including Tuvalu, is being denied \r\nparticipation in the United Nations system. It cannot \r\nbe right that the twenty-second-largest global economy, \r\nwith a notable capacity to contribute, cannot effectively \r\nparticipate in our 2030 Agenda. This is unfortunate, \r\ngiven that our 2030 Agenda needs genuine global \r\npartnerships to mobilize all available resources to \r\nbe successful. Under its principle of universality, the \r\nUnited Nations should allow the 23 million people of \r\nTaiwan to enjoy their fundamental right to participate \r\nfully in the United Nations system and to benefit and \r\ncontribute effectively to its programmes.\r\nIn the same vein, the people of Cuba must be \r\nallowed to freely exercise their rights to determine their \r\nown political, economic and social systems. With their \r\nrights and trade restricted by the unilateral blockade \r\nimposed by the United States, the people of Cuba \r\nare denied effective participation in our Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals programmes.\r\nA/72/PV.13 21/09/2017\r\n24/24 17-29591\r\nOf similar concerns, the people of West Papua \r\nshould be enabled to exercise their fundamental right, \r\nwith the intervention of this responsible Organization, \r\nto determine their own development aspirations and \r\nfuture. The West Papuans are a distinct people with \r\nPacific roots, with their own land, history and culture. \r\nThe violation of human rights in West Papua is a matter \r\nof constant and great concern to us. Tuvalu strongly \r\nbelieves that the United Nations must engage in setting \r\na clear pathway to address these issues and the issue of \r\nself-determination for the people of West Papua.\r\nWe must embrace the genuine partnership of those \r\nwho can contribute to the realization of a decent life in \r\nour marginalized communities. We cannot ignore and \r\nrisk leaving behind those who hope for a decent life \r\nbut are being constrained by violence, natural disasters, \r\nviolation of human rights, atrocities and the impacts of \r\nclimate change. We cannot leave anyone behind.\r\nFinally, I wish to express Tuvalu’s strong support \r\nfor a global pact on the environment, as initiated and \r\nproposed by France. We need an internationally legally \r\nbinding agreement that protects our rights to a safe \r\nand clean environment. We are but on one big canoe \r\nfor humankind and, as Canadian Prime Minister Justin \r\nTrudeau said this morning (see A/72/PV.12), no one \r\ncountry has the right to jump ship on climate change. \r\nWe must either paddle together to keep the canoe afloat \r\nand safe, or allow the canoe to sink and drown. It is \r\nour hope that, with this global pact on the environment \r\nand the Paris Agreement, we can save Tuvalu. If we can \r\nsave Tuvalu, we can save the world.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of Tuvalu \r\nfor the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Enele Sosene Sopoaga, Prime Minister of \r\nTuvalu, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.20 p.m.\r\n"
