"United Nations A/72/PV.15\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n15th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 22 September 2017, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Paul Biya, President of the \r\nRepublic of Cameroon\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Republic of Cameroon.\r\nMr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted into the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, and to invite him to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Biya (spoke in French): I would like \r\nto congratulate you, Mr. President, on assuming the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. I am sure that your rich experience will \r\nserve us well in successfully steering our deliberations. \r\nYou can count on the full cooperation of my delegation.\r\nMy congratulations also go to Ambassador Peter \r\nТhomson, your predecessor and the architect of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, on his \r\ncommendable record.\r\nLastly, I would like, once again, to congratulate \r\nMr. António Guterres on his unanimous election as \r\nSecretary-General of our Organization. He can count \r\non the continuing support of Cameroon as he carries \r\nout his important and complex tasks.\r\nThis session is being held in a global context of \r\nmultiple hotbeds of tension all over the world, in which \r\nterrorism continues to claim thousands of victims, \r\nhuman activity is causing climate disruptions and \r\npoverty is far from declining. But it is also taking place \r\nin parallel with laudable efforts aimed at implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which \r\nis designed to ensure humankind’s development in such \r\na way that no one will be left behind. That explains the \r\nfull relevance of this general debate under the theme \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”.\r\nOur debates, especially our conclusions, will be \r\na litmus test of our commitment to the ideals of the \r\npeoples of the United Nations, who, in the Preamble to \r\nthe Charter, have stated their resolve to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to promote \r\nsocial progress and create better standards of living for \r\nall people. For Cameroon and most of our States, peace \r\nis the sine qua non for the survival of humankind and \r\nsustainable development. The peace we have continues \r\nto be dangerously threatened, notably by terrorism, \r\nconflicts, poverty and climate disruptions. Today we \r\nare all, I would say, supplicants for peace, and such \r\npersistent threats are of enormous concern to all of us.\r\nToday, no continent or country is spared the scourge \r\nof terrorism, whose atrocities have, unfortunately, \r\nbecome part and parcel of our daily lives. Let me cite \r\na few examples, In August 2017, attacks took place in \r\nBarcelona and Ouagadougou; in July 2016, a Baghdad \r\nbombing left 292 dead; in October 2015, the crash of \r\na Russian Airbus in the Sinai left 224 dead; a March \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

The number of victims of the Boko Haram \r\nterrorist sect in the Lake Chad basin is estimated to \r\nbe 2,000. Cameroon and other neighbouring countries \r\nhave been dealing with that sect, which changes its \r\nmethods and tactics daily, and we appreciate the \r\nsupport of our partners in the fight against such \r\nbarbarism. The fight against Boko Haram, a jihadist \r\nsect, will need more widespread mobilization if we \r\nreally want to stamp it out. It is killing our peoples, our \r\ncommunities, our independence and our democracy. It \r\nspells death for peace. In that regard, we look forward \r\nto the forthcoming visit to the Lake Chad region of the \r\nhigh-level mission led by the Secretary-General and \r\nmandated by the Security Council under resolution \r\n2349 (2017).\r\nWe deplore the continuing conflicts in Africa, \r\nAsia, Latin America and the Middle East, which are \r\nwreaking pain and hardship — so many dead, so many \r\nrefugees and displaced persons, so many children \r\nwandering without a roof over their heads and facing \r\nuncertain, even shattered futures. Cameroon, which \r\nhas hosted and continues to host thousands of Central \r\nAfrican and Nigerian refugees, understands the degree \r\nto which they feel hurt, victimized and threatened in \r\ntheir very existence. Let us therefore mobilize, and \r\nthrough our policies, behaviours and actions, let us \r\nrefocus on people.\r\nPeace is under threat, not only from terrorism \r\nand conflicts, but also from persistent poverty. The \r\nSecurity Council has rightly reiterated that poverty is \r\na serious threat. Why, then, do we have such difficulty \r\ntackling it accordingly? The numerous declarations and \r\nresolutions, the various United Nations development \r\ndecades and the plans of action and other agendas \r\nadopted by the United Nations have not really been \r\neffective, and the result is clear. Poverty persists, and \r\nthe gap between rich and poor countries is continues to \r\nwiden. The situation has been aggravated by a decline \r\nin commodity prices.\r\nLet us galvanize ourselves in a powerful surge of \r\nsolidarity to roll back poverty. Let us match our words \r\nwith our actions and thereby create the conditions for \r\na decent life for our peoples. Let us therefore focus \r\non people.\r\nWe must, for present and future generations, save \r\nour planet. We therefore welcome the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, which Cameroon, I would like \r\nto point out, was among the first countries to sign \r\nand ratify. We are pleased that steps are being taken \r\nto implement it effectively. I would like to take this \r\nopportunity to emphasize the legitimate and unanimous \r\ndesire of developing countries. As we all know, they \r\npollute less and should therefore receive resources from \r\nthe rich countries, which pollute more, to enable them \r\nto effectively promote the goals of the Paris Agreement \r\nat their level.\r\nAfrica has two major environmental challenges. \r\nThe first is the ongoing forest degradation in Central \r\nAfrica. Let us save the Congo basin, which is planet \r\nEarth’s second lung. Secondly, there is desertification, \r\nwhich is causing Lake Chad to disappear. That vast body \r\nof water, essential to the survival of communities and \r\nbiodiversity, has already lost 90 per cent of its former \r\nsurface area. Let us save Lake Chad and thereby help to \r\npreserve the planet for the greater good of humankind.\r\nThe quest for peace concerns all of us. All countries \r\nmust join forces to achieve peace. Is it not high time \r\nthen for the voice of poor countries, especially those \r\nof Africa, to be heard? Is it not high time that Africa’s \r\nmessage to the world was better taken into account? Is \r\nit not high time that we structured our Organization to \r\ngive more weight to Africa’s voice within a revitalized \r\nGeneral Assembly and a Security Council that is \r\nmore receptive and more even-handed to us? A world \r\ncharacterized by greater solidarity is the prerequisite \r\nfor peace on Earth.\r\nIn conclusion, peace is our most precious asset. \r\nWithout it, we cannot undertake sustainable and \r\neffective initiatives in the interest of our peoples, \r\nespecially our young people. The theme of this debate \r\naptly reminds us of the commitment of the founding \r\nfathers of the United Nations, that is, to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and ensure a decent \r\nlife for all, free from want, through cooperation. This \r\ndebate urges us to renew our faith in the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the United Nations. Let us together take \r\nup the great challenge of world peace and development.\r\nOnce again, Cameroon, as it did from this very \r\nrostrum on 10 September 2000, urges the world to rally \r\ntogether in one great coalition for humankind, which \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 3/26\r\nmust restore to the centre of our policies. For its sake, let \r\nus secure peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Paul Biya, President of the Republic of \r\nCameroon, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of \r\nGovernment and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nImmigration of the Republic of Kiribati\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President, Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration of the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati.\r\nMr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head \r\nof Government and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nImmigration of the Republic of Kiribati, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Maamau: I bring warm greetings \r\nfrom the Government and the people of the Republic \r\nof Kiribati, on whose behalf I am very honoured and \r\nhumbled to address this gathering. In our traditional \r\nway and in the Lord’s name, I share with the General \r\nAssembly blessings and peace. May all be blessed.\r\nI join previous speakers in congratulating you, \r\nMr. President, on your election to the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nYou have an important responsibility to chart and lead \r\nthe course of our work during this session, and I am \r\nconfident that, under your able leadership, we will \r\nachieve the goals and targets set for this session based \r\non the theme “Focusing on people: striving for peace \r\nand a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. Please \r\nbe assured of our full support and cooperation.\r\nI join others in commending and acknowledging \r\nwith gratitude and pride the marvellous leadership \r\nof your predecessor and our Pacific brother, His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji.\r\nAs this is our new Secretary-General’s first general \r\ndebate, I extend to him our heartfelt congratulations on \r\nhis assumption of the leadership of our Organization, \r\nand acknowledge his unwavering commitment to \r\nreforming the United Nations in order to make it more \r\ninclusive and responsive to the contemporary global \r\nrealities facing its Member States.\r\nI congratulate you, Sir, on the theme you have \r\nchosen for this session. It serves as a reminder to us \r\nof two of the great wonders of creation: our people \r\nand our planet. They are giving rise, however, to great \r\nconcern both for today and for tomorrow. People are the \r\nfundamental foundations of our families, our societies, \r\nour nations and our planet, bound together by strong \r\nhuman values and a strong faith in God. The theme \r\nreminds us of our important responsibility as leaders \r\nto ensure that human lives, human dignity and human \r\nvalues must prevail over dollar value. We must make \r\nsure we serve and deliver on our main objective as a \r\nglobal family to provide a peaceful and secure world \r\nwithout nuclear weapons and promote social progress, \r\nbetter living standards, human rights and dignity for all \r\nour citizens. We all want to live a happy life on a safe \r\nand sustainable planet.\r\nAs leaders of our sovereign nations we are \r\nresponsible for our people, who are at the heart of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Every year, \r\nwe converge in this Hall from all corners of our planet \r\nto represent the voices of our people, to share their \r\ntriumphs and tribulations and to share our visions for \r\nthem and for our planet. The voices we represent at this \r\ngathering are constant and dominated by messages of \r\ntrials and challenges with varying degrees of urgency \r\nand intensity.\r\nIn recent years we have continued to witness \r\nhuman suffering around the world as a result of armed \r\nconflicts, terrorism, persecution, corruption, climate \r\nchange and natural disaster, to name but a few. Over \r\nthe past few weeks we also have witnessed, through \r\nthe media, heartbreaking news of the loss of lives and \r\nextensive devastation in the Caribbean, Mexico and \r\nthe United States caused by the unprecedented and \r\ncontinued onslaught of Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, Jose \r\nand Maria, as well as an earthquake.\r\nWhile they have not been as widely reported as \r\nthe hurricanes and earthquakes in the Americas, the \r\nintense typhoons and monsoons in Asia have also \r\ncaused great human suffering and loss. On behalf of the \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n4/26 17-29710\r\npeople and Government of Kiribati, I offer our heartfelt \r\ncondolences and prayers to all victims of those natural \r\ntragedies as they try to rebuild their lives after the loss \r\nof their loved ones and their homes.\r\nWe deal with human suffering in countries affected \r\nby rapid-onset disasters, but we must not forget the \r\nplight of those in countries such as Kiribati, Tuvalu, \r\nthe Marshall Islands, the Maldives and other small \r\nisland developing States, who continue to suffer on a \r\ndaily basis from the impact of the slow-onset climate \r\ndisaster. It may not be capturing the attention of the \r\nglobal community, owing to its slow impact and to \r\nlimited media attention, but it is causing great pain and \r\nsuffering in our communities.\r\nDuring this seventy-second session and in view of \r\nour theme, the United Nations should focus on the most \r\nvulnerable and underprivileged members of our global \r\nfamily, such as the least developed countries and small \r\nisland developing States. We must provide them with \r\nspecial attention and support so that they can achieve \r\nself-sufficiency and enjoy decent and dignified lives. \r\nWe must make sure they are not left behind in our global \r\njourney towards achieving the global development \r\nagenda. We must provide a platform on which they can \r\nparticipate meaningfully in international processes \r\nthat affect their lives. We must make sure their voices \r\nare heard.\r\nInternational processes and systems must be \r\nsimplified and streamlined so as to enable enhanced \r\nparticipation and easy access to global resources like \r\nthe Green Climate Fund. Above all else, human lives \r\nand dignity must be protected. We must celebrate and \r\nbuild on the diversity of our people, our rich cultures \r\nand values. We must respect each other and work \r\ntogether to overcome global challenges and unlock \r\nglobal potential.\r\nLike others, Kiribati looks forward to a day when \r\nwe will have a different story to tell to our children and \r\nour children’s children — a story without heartbreaking \r\nhuman suffering and loss; a story of success and joy. \r\nThat story must start with the major transformation of \r\nour homes, our societies, our nations and our world but, \r\nmost importantly, with the immediate transformation \r\nof our hearts. That is the main source of our \r\nglobal problems.\r\nMy Government is embarking on an ambitious \r\ntransformative 20-year vision for Kiribati towards \r\nbecoming a wealthy, healthy and secure nation based \r\non accelerated growth and strategic investment in our \r\nhuman, natural and cultural capital. Our priority sectors \r\nin the immediate term are fisheries and tourism, with an \r\nanticipated boost in our national income levels to help \r\nfinance our development priorities. Our intervention is \r\ntargeted at empowering our people at the household and \r\ncommunity levels. They are the foundation on which \r\nour nation is based. The stronger the foundation, the \r\nmore resilient and more self-sufficient our nation can \r\nbe. My Government has put in place income-generation \r\nprogrammes to boost household income levels in order \r\nto address poverty and hardship in our society and \r\nprovide an opportunity for a decent and dignified life \r\nfor our people.\r\nOur Government’s policy is to serve and deliver to \r\nour people based on the principles of good governance \r\nand transparency. We have established a parliamentary \r\nselect committee on anti-corruption. We have enacted \r\na leadership code and put in place the necessary \r\nregulations and arrangements for the establishment \r\nof a leadership commission next year. Before I left \r\nKiribati earlier this week, I launched our first-ever \r\nnational anti-corruption strategy covering the public \r\nsector, the private sector and civil society. Nurturing \r\nand developing a decent life for all requires genuine \r\nand inclusive partnerships. We acknowledge existing \r\npartnerships and look forward to establishing new ones.\r\nWe cannot talk about focusing on people and \r\ncreating a decent life for all if our United Nations family \r\nis incomplete or unbalanced. Every year, we pledge to \r\nconsolidate and act together to provide a better life \r\nfor our people, yet we choose to ignore the 23 million \r\npeople in Taiwan and deprive them of the right to be part \r\nof this global family and to participate and contribute \r\nmeaningfully to the sustainable development agenda. \r\nWe call for a reform programme that will see Taiwan \r\nincluded in our global family’s efforts and drive to \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nOur planet is struggling to keep up with our \r\ninsatiable greed and demands. We are stretching our \r\nplanet’s capacity to dangerous limits. Continuing with \r\nunsustainable patterns of production and consumption \r\nwill undoubtedly push our planet’s life-support \r\nsystem to the brink of collapse. The warning signs of \r\nunprecedented natural events, bringing despair and \r\nhavoc in their wake, should serve as confirmation of \r\nthe poor health of our planet.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 5/26\r\nWith lessons learned from the damage we have \r\ncaused to our atmosphere, we must ensure that we \r\nact urgently and collectively to conserve our ocean \r\nso that we do not repeat the same mistake we made \r\nwith our atmosphere. I am encouraged to note item \r\n77 on the agenda of the General Assembly, which \r\nproposes, among other things, the formulation of an \r\ninternationally legally binding instrument for the \r\nmanagement and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\r\nThat is crucial for Kiribati and other countries \r\nthat rely heavily on revenue from fisheries. A single \r\nmanagement failure in any such fisheries area, or \r\nany other part of the ocean, could have devastating \r\nconsequences, not just for the fisheries of a nearby \r\nexclusive economic zone but potentially for the fisheries \r\nof the entire ocean. Fishing revenue accounts for about \r\n80 per cent of our current budget. I cannot emphasize \r\nenough the impact of such an issue on the ambitious \r\nvision by which, 20 years from now, Kiribati aspires to \r\nimplement a self-reliance strategy to harvest, process \r\nand market its own tuna.\r\nThe ocean has a strong connection to the people \r\nand to peace and prosperity. Kiribati has played its part \r\nin the conservation and management of the ocean by \r\ndeclaring 11 per cent of its total exclusive economic \r\nzone as a marine protected area, a non-commercial \r\nzone and a world heritage entity under UNESCO, \r\nwith the aim of enabling the re-stocking of fisheries \r\nresources for the future. We have also declared our \r\nentire exclusive economic zone a shark sanctuary. \r\nIf a small, resource-constrained nation like mine is \r\nwilling to make such a profound sacrifice, affecting \r\nits own economy and a resource for the entire world \r\nthat its people rely on every day for a living, this global \r\nfamily certainly has a far greater capacity to do more \r\nand make sacrifices that focus on people, so that our \r\nchildren and their children can build a decent life in a \r\nsustainable environment.\r\nIn spite of all those challenges, we remain steadfast \r\nin our strong development aspirations and vision for \r\nour people. We need swift global action on climate \r\nchange and we require support to mitigate and alleviate \r\nthe suffering of our people. We are grateful for the \r\nsupport of all our development partners in our efforts to \r\naddress the impact of climate change on our people in \r\nareas such as water and sanitation, coastal protection of \r\nour water resources, our critical public infrastructure \r\nand farmland.\r\nAccess to climate financing such as the Green \r\nClimate Fund takes too long to process and disburse. \r\nThe longer the delay in delivering that much needed \r\nfinancing for urgent adaptation, the greater the cost to \r\nour people and environment. We simply cannot afford \r\nto wait any longer. As part of my Government’s plan, \r\nKiribati Vision 20, we have decided to take charge \r\nof our fate and put in place innovative financing \r\nmodalities. That will enable us to fast-track financing \r\nsupport for our sustainable development agenda, \r\nespecially in relation to climate change and disaster \r\nrisk management.\r\nWith the approval of Parliament, my Government \r\nis leveraging our sovereign wealth fund as collateral for \r\nconcessional debt financing. Ideally, the Government \r\nwill be looking at concessional debt financing with an \r\ninterest rate of 1 to 2 per cent, to be repaid when climate \r\nor adaptation financing is available. We are currently \r\nearning about a 6 per cent return on our investment. \r\nThat is a move beyond traditional and conventional \r\nroles, but we would rather take the initiative to drive \r\nour own aspirations and deliver to our people, than \r\nwait for financial assistance that may come at a \r\nmoment far too late. The fate of humankind and life \r\nmust not be mortgaged to the bureaucratic processes of \r\nfinancial institutions.\r\nIn conclusion, as leaders of this global family, we \r\nhave a moral responsibility to focus on the people we \r\nserve, strive for peace and a decent life for all and make \r\nsure the health of the planet is sustained so that it can \r\ncontinue to support life. In our quest for sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we often focus on the economic \r\nfundamentals at the expense of human values. For so \r\nlong, our focus has been diverted from the very purpose \r\nof this global family to our individual fights and quest \r\nfor power, dominance and greed. In the process, we \r\nfail to recognize that for some members of this global \r\nfamily, their priority is simply to survive and provide a \r\ndecent life and future for their children.\r\nThe compassion and love that exist within all of us \r\ncan easily transform our global challenges by focusing \r\non the most vulnerable members of our global family. \r\nWe contemplate how we can best find grand solutions, \r\nwhen all we really need is to translate the meaning \r\nof family into what it stands for — love, compassion, \r\nrespect, understanding and kindness. Those are \r\npriceless solutions to the mounting problems that we \r\ncontinue to battle.\r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n6/26 17-29710\r\nWe come to this gathering to listen and converse, \r\nand let us do so with greater compassion, understanding, \r\nlove, respect and kindness. As the saying goes, it is \r\nnever too late to start. Lastly, I share with those present, \r\nall our heart, love and traditional blessing: Te mauri, te \r\nraoi ao te tabomoa, which means “health, peace and \r\nprosperity to us all”. God bless all our people. God bless \r\nour United Nations leaders and our United Nations \r\nfamily and God bless our shared home, our planet.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President, Head of Government and \r\nMinister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration of the \r\nRepublic of Kiribati for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Taneti Maamau, President, Head of Government \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs and Immigration \r\nof the Republic of Kiribati, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Faustin Archange Touadera, \r\nPresident of the Central African Republic\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Central African Republic.\r\nMr. Faustin Archange Touadera, President of the \r\nCentral African Republic, was escorted into the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Faustin Archange Touadera, President \r\nof the Central African Republic, and to invite him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nPresident Touadera (spoke in French): I should \r\nlike to add my voice to those that have preceded me at \r\nthis rostrum in order to extend to you, Mr. President, \r\nmy warmest congratulations on your election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. We wish you every success in fulfilling \r\nyour noble task.\r\nI would also like to express my deep appreciation \r\nto your predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his \r\ntremendous work and outstanding achievements during \r\nhis tenure. And I commend Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres for his actions since his arrival at the head of \r\nour shared Organization.\r\nThe General Assembly is meeting for its seventy-\r\nsecond session at a time when our planet is facing \r\nnumerous challenges, including the problem of \r\ninternational terrorism, that must be urgently addressed. \r\nInsecurity has taken root everywhere. Whether in the \r\nMiddle East, Africa or Europe, international security is \r\nconstantly under threat from terrorist groups of every \r\nstripe. That is why I am appealing solemnly to the \r\nentire international community to redouble its efforts \r\nand pool its resources in order to eradicate this scourge.\r\nRegarding migration, North Africa is in turmoil \r\nas it sees so many victims abandoned in the desert or \r\ndisappearing at sea. The route across the Mediterranean \r\nfrequently ends in disaster and continues to be a major \r\nchallenge that we must tackle. Moreover, the problem \r\nof refugees has worsened in recent years and is now so \r\nserious that it is a priority concern of the international \r\ncommunity that demands special attention.\r\nConcerning climate change and sustainable \r\ndevelopment, our planet continues to suffer the effects \r\nof natural phenomena such as earthquakes, f loods, \r\ndrought, rapid desertification and global warming, \r\nwhich are real worries. To that end, I would remind us \r\nall, as signatories to the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, that we should honour the commitments \r\nmade at the twenty-first Conference of the Parties to \r\nthe United Nations Framework Convention on Climate \r\nChange regarding the importance of pooling our efforts \r\nin order to preserve our shared environment.\r\nWith regard to United Nations reform, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, as a member of the African Union \r\n(AU), supports the common position of AU member \r\nStates, as adopted by the Group of Eleven Forum in \r\nMalabo, on the need to enlarge the Security Council to \r\ninclude Africa.\r\nOther global issues are the respect for human \r\nrights, the rule of law and good governance, which are \r\nindispensable prerequisites for social welfare. I pledge \r\nthat the Central African Republic will continue to make \r\nits modest contribution to our joint efforts for peace, \r\nsecurity and sustainable development, to which we \r\nall aspire.\r\nI welcome the choice of theme for the present \r\nsession, entitled “Focusing on people: Striving \r\nfor peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable \r\nplanet”, an appropriate reflection of the importance of \r\nhumankind’s place in our Organization’s agenda and in \r\nline with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nadopted here in 2015 with the aim of reducing poverty \r\nby half by 2030.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 7/26\r\nToday, as part of its national reconstruction policy, \r\nthe Central African Republic’s peacebuilding and \r\nrecovery programme puts its citizens, as human beings, \r\nat the heart of its priorities. With the support of our \r\ntechnical and financial partners, the programme has \r\nenabled the Government to establish an appropriate \r\ninstitutional framework for the conduct, monitoring \r\nand evaluation of the SDGs, with particular emphasis \r\non the objectives that have been identified as priorities.\r\nSince this meeting of the Assembly offers me an \r\nopportunity to speak about the situation of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, let me say a few words about \r\nthat. At the Brussels donor conference in November \r\n2016, I mentioned the dream I share with my fellow \r\ncountrymen of rebuilding a State that can come to \r\nterms with itself as a diverse and reconciled nation in \r\na state of calm. Our plea led, as I have indicated, to an \r\nunprecedented display of international solidarity with \r\nthe Central African Republic aimed at ensuring the \r\nimplementation of the Central African peacebuilding \r\nand recovery programme.\r\nIn order to follow up on the plan’s implementation, \r\nwe have reached an agreement that will serve as a new \r\nframework for mutual commitment between the Central \r\nAfrican Republic and the international community. It is \r\nin that spirit of continuing consultation with partners \r\nthat on Tuesday, 19 September, here in New York, I \r\npresented an account of the progress we have made in \r\nimplementing our commitments to attaining the Central \r\nAfrican peacebuilding and recovery programme.\r\nTo touch on some aspects of the programme, \r\nwith regard to our commitment to peace and security, \r\nthe Government of the Central African Republic \r\nhas combined its resources in order to consolidate \r\nthe process for the cessation of all hostilities in the \r\ncountry. Through hard work, we have been able to \r\nsecure the active and permanent participation of the 14 \r\narmed groups involved in the work of our consultative \r\nfollow-up committee on disarmament, demobilization, \r\nreintegration and repatriation (DDRR) in the national \r\nDDRR programme, and the committee held its seventh \r\nsession on 3 and 4 August.\r\nIn our determined quest for peace, we accepted the \r\nassistance of the Community of Sant’Egidio, which led \r\nto the signing of the Political Agreement for Peace in the \r\nCentral African Republic on 19 June. On that occasion \r\nall the armed groups had to reaffirm their commitment \r\nto the integrity of our national territory, to our shared \r\nvalues and to the constitutional principles of the \r\nRepublic. Despite that significant progress, we deplore \r\ncertain armed groups’ violations of their commitment \r\nto an immediate cessation of hostilities throughout the \r\ncountry, and my Government categorically condemns \r\nthe senseless violence that continues to darken the lives \r\nof innocent civilians.\r\nIn order to galvanize the peace process into \r\nreaching its full potential, strengthen the coherence \r\nof our approach and unite the support of our friends, \r\nwe have worked to harmonize all the peace efforts in \r\nthe Central African Republic, resulting in the adoption \r\nof a road map for peace and national reconciliation in \r\nthe Central African Republic in Libreville on 17 July. \r\nWe welcome that major progress, which marks the \r\nunwavering commitment of our neighbours and of the \r\nAfrican Union, the Economic Community of Central \r\nAfrican States and the International Conference on the \r\nGreat Lakes Region to the success of our untiring quest \r\nfor peace.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to welcome \r\nthe very promising outcome of the first meeting of the \r\nfacilitation panel of the African Initiative in Bangui on \r\n11 September. Here, before the Assembly, I reaffirm \r\nmy commitment to the African Initiative, as well \r\nas to ensuring its full success for the benefit of my \r\nfellow citizens, in line with the expectations we share \r\nwith the friendly countries and organizations that are \r\nsupporting us. At this stage, it is the sole framework \r\nuniting all efforts aimed at achieving peace and \r\nreconciliation under the determined leadership of the \r\nCentral African Government.\r\nWithin the context of the implementation of \r\nthe disarmament, demobilization, repatriation and \r\nreintegration programme, the work of the advisory and \r\nmonitoring committee continues, and the programme \r\nhas gained steam with the pilot project that I launched \r\non 30 August. Its first phase involves 40 ex-combatants \r\nfrom each of 13 of the 14 armed groups. We are making \r\nevery effort to ensure that the pilot programme’s \r\nsuccess becomes a monument to our true commitment \r\nto peace, because our faith in peace is unshakable.\r\nAt the same time, we are working to rebuild a \r\nnational, representative, professional and republican \r\narmy within a framework of security-sector reform, \r\ninformed by a national security policy based on a \r\npolitical consensus that takes threats to security into \r\naccount, and on the republican values and principles \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n8/26 17-29710\r\nthat must guide the State in its sovereign mission to \r\nensure security for all. In that spirit, the support offered \r\nby the European Union Military Training Mission in \r\nthe Central African Republic has enabled us to form \r\ntwo battalions ready for deployment, and friendly and \r\nbrotherly countries have made a concrete demonstration \r\nof their solidarity by training Central African \r\ncomponents in accordance with the relevant resolutions \r\nof the Security Council. In order to address the need to \r\nstrengthen internal security, 500 police and gendarmes \r\nhave been recruited with the help of the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \r\nthe Central African Republic (MINUSCA).\r\nIn the areas of justice and human rights, our efforts \r\nhave focused on operationalizing the Special Criminal \r\nCourt and training prison guards, as well as on \r\nimproving our judicial and penitentiary infrastructure. \r\nMy Government attaches great importance to national \r\nreconciliation, but that cannot be achieved without \r\njustice, which must address the many claims of victims.\r\nThe Administration’s redeployment in the \r\nprefectures is also one of our biggest and most urgent \r\npriorities, and its implementation has had support \r\nfrom the international community. I welcome the \r\nredeployment of civil servants in the various districts \r\nof the country, as well as the considerable resources \r\nthat have already been invested in restoring public \r\ninfrastructure. With the continued support of our \r\nfriends and through the United Nations, the Government \r\nhas initiated the Bambari pilot project, aimed at \r\nsignalling the restoration of State authority. With that \r\nnew momentum in redeploying the Administration \r\nthroughout the territory, we are proceeding in stages so \r\nas to ensure that the approach is as inclusive as possible.\r\nRegarding financial governance, the Government’s \r\nwork is yielding encouraging results, which must be \r\npursued more vigorously, given that the country has yet \r\nto emerge fully from the acute crisis that tore it apart. \r\nSince the agreement signed with the International \r\nMonetary Fund in June 2016, several measures have \r\nbeen implemented to increase the State’s financial \r\nperformance. The strengthening of public financial \r\nmanagement mechanisms has been reflected in the \r\nadoption of measures to rationalize parafiscal measures \r\nand increase transparency so as better to cope with \r\nrevenue shortfalls. The outcome of the second review \r\nunder the extended credit-facility management issued \r\nby the International Monetary Fund in July confirms \r\nthat we have definitely embarked on a path of good \r\nfinancial governance.\r\nEconomic recovery is another area that we are \r\ngiving undivided attention. The protracted crisis had \r\na disastrous impact on production and has led to high \r\npoverty rates. The lack of economic opportunities and \r\nprospects have led some of my fellow citizens to join \r\nthose resorting to violence. The reconstruction of the \r\nCentral African Republic will continue to elude us \r\nas long as production continues to be unpredictable, \r\nunregimented and completely unregulated by the \r\nauthorities. Among other measures, my Government \r\nis meanwhile committed to building up its DDRR \r\nprogramme so that all the energy that was previously \r\nchannelled into negative activity  can be reinvested \r\nmore profitably in the service of the nation and for \r\ncommunity recovery. In that regard, the primary sector, \r\nagriculture and livestock are central to our efforts.\r\nThe exploitation of natural resources, a sector in \r\nurgent need of attention, must be entirely controlled by \r\nthe State. While we all know that the Central African \r\nRepublic is overflowing with immense resources, they \r\nwill continue to be empty words if we cannot harness \r\nthose resources for a positive impact on the daily life of \r\nevery one of my fellow citizens.\r\nDespite all these efforts and the progress that \r\nhas been made, we must not ignore the humanitarian \r\nsituation, which has seriously deteriorated in several \r\nparts of the country in the wake of a resurgence \r\nof violence, whose real motive continues is still a \r\nrapacious and fierce competition for the illegal control \r\nand exploitation of the riches that lie beneath and on \r\nthe surface of the soil of the Central African Republic.\r\nSome 2.4 million people are estimated to be in \r\nneed of emergency humanitarian assistance. We are \r\ndealing with 600,000 internally displaced persons who \r\nmust be supported and helped so that they can return to \r\ntheir homes and lead productive lives. On top of that, \r\nwe estimate that 500,000 of our citizens are currently \r\nrefugees living primarily in neighbouring countries, \r\nand we must make every effort to repatriate them. \r\nThe humanitarian crisis we are experiencing only \r\ncompounds the complexity of the political situation, \r\nand we must work to remedy it.\r\nWith regard to future action, I would like to share \r\nwith the Assembly our main areas of focus within the \r\nmutual engagement framework. On the issue of peace \r\nand security, I want to concentrate all our efforts on \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 9/26\r\nensuring that we will have taken significant steps \r\nin terms of dialogue with armed groups and the \r\nimplementation of the national DDRR programme by \r\nthe end of this year, and I am firmly committed to that.\r\nNevertheless, although the dialogue in this area \r\nis under way, it is a fact that the State must continue \r\nto function and especially to ensure the safety of all \r\ncitizens. In order for the Forces armées centrafricaines \r\nand the interior security forces to undertake their \r\nredeployment efforts, they must be able to take \r\naction. On behalf of the people of the Central African \r\nRepublic, I therefore solemnly call on the Security \r\nCouncil, as the political organ of the United Nations \r\ntasked with ensuring world peace, to deploy the means \r\nat its disposal, including relaxing the conditions \r\ngoverning the equipping of our republican defence and \r\nsecurity forces so that they can contribute to the rapid \r\nrestoration of peace and security in the Central African \r\nRepublic and enable us to consolidate the democratic \r\nachievements made thus far.\r\nWith respect to political, administrative and \r\nfinancial governance, we are going to strengthen our \r\ndialogue with all national actors and provide political \r\nsupport for the implementation of the road map for \r\npeace and reconciliation in our country. Our most \r\nardent wish is to be able to conclude that dialogue in \r\n2017, so that the new year will have genuine prospects \r\nfor peace. In that regard I call on the African Union, \r\nthe Economic Community of Central African States \r\nand the International Conference on the Great Lakes \r\nRegion to act swiftly and accelerate the deliberations of \r\nthe facilitation panel. I will also commit to working in \r\nthe area of justice and reconciliation. The preparations \r\nfor the implementation of the transitional justice \r\nmechanism should enable us to make 2018 a year \r\ndedicated to the immense task of giving our citizens the \r\nopportunity to talk to one another in a candid way, help \r\nthe truth emerge and decide to move forward towards a \r\nbrighter future.\r\nMr. Barros Melet (Chile), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nIn brief, that is our situation. That is the work that \r\nwe are doing constantly to achieve peace, reconciliation \r\nand the reconstruction of the Central African Republic. \r\nI am fully committed to the success of efforts to bring \r\nabout peace. However, Member States are undoubtedly \r\naware of the Central African Republic’s limited \r\ncapacity. Today, on top of our own weaknesses, we are \r\nworried about the fact that even MINUSCA’s staff is \r\ninadequate to the challenge of protecting our civilians. \r\nThe heightened security threats linked to violence from \r\narmed groups mean that more must be done to ensure that \r\nthe crisis does not spread. As I plead for the easement of \r\nthe equipment restrictions on our army, I now also call \r\non the international community to increase MINUSCA’s \r\nmilitary component, given the huge territory that it has \r\nto cover. I also ask that its mandate, which will expire \r\nvery soon, be reviewed and strengthened, so as to help \r\nthe legitimate Government regain control of those areas \r\nthat have natural resources sought after by various \r\ngroups beyond Government control.\r\nI would like to express the gratitude of the Central \r\nAfrican people to the brotherly countries that have \r\nsent peacekeepers to my country. I pay tribute to the \r\nmemory of those who have perished in carrying out \r\ntheir noble and dangerous mission of peace. I wish \r\nevery success for our deliberations and am grateful for \r\nthe opportunity to speak about my country, the Central \r\nAfrican Republic.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the President \r\nof the Central African Republic for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Faustin Archange Touadera, President of the \r\nCentral African Republic, was escorted from the \r\nGeneral Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nMr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I have the honour to \r\nwelcome to the United Nations Mr. Pavel Filip, Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Moldova, and to invite him \r\nto address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Filip (Republic of Moldova) (spoke in \r\nRomanian; English text provided by the delegation): \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n10/26 17-29710\r\nAt the outset, I would like to warmly congratulate \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session and to \r\nwish him success in fulfilling his important mandate.\r\nMy thanks also go to his predecessor Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, for his dedication and professionalism in \r\nconducting the work of the previous session.\r\nI take this opportunity to express words of \r\nencouragement and support to the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. António Guterres. I am confident that with his \r\ncompetent leadership and the joint efforts of the Member \r\nStates, we will succeed in redefining the role of the \r\nUnited Nations and adjusting it to the requirements of \r\nthe modern world.\r\nClearly, all of us gathered in this great Hall are \r\ndeeply concerned about the challenges confronting \r\nthe international community. The armed conflicts in \r\nthe Middle East, protracted disputes, terrorism and \r\nviolent extremism, and the aff liction caused by poverty \r\nare only some of the problems undermining peace and \r\nsustainable development. We are equally concerned \r\nabout the excessive accumulation of conventional \r\nweapons and the development of nuclear programmes. \r\nAn international environment marked by threats to \r\nuse force, including nuclear arms, greatly exacerbates \r\npeople’s sense of insecurity and lack of trust.\r\nThe devastating natural disasters occurring \r\nwith increasing frequency in a warming world affect \r\nhundreds of millions of people, especially those living \r\nin extreme poverty. In that context, I would like to \r\nexpress our compassion and deep condolences to \r\nthe countries and the families affected by the recent \r\ndevastating hurricanes, as well as by the earthquake \r\nin Mexico.\r\nThe statements by previous speakers show that we \r\nall have similar perceptions of global problems. Today \r\nmore than ever, we need the joint commitment of all \r\nStates Members of the United Nations to face those \r\nchallenges. In that context, I would like to reiterate my \r\ncountry’s full support for Secretary-General Guterres’s \r\nreform agenda, which puts renewed emphasis on conflict \r\nprevention, the repositioning of the development system \r\nand reform of the internal management of the United \r\nNations in order to effectively address the world’s \r\nmajor challenges.\r\nSince signing the European Union Association \r\nAgreement in June 2014, my country has engaged \r\nin a complex process of structural reforms aimed at \r\nbuilding a modern society based on the European \r\ndevelopment model. Our efforts have concentrated on \r\nsteadily consolidating the rule of law and developing \r\na functioning market economy, as well emphasizing \r\na prominent social dimension and respect for \r\nhuman rights.\r\nThe strategic priorities for sectoral development \r\ninclude, first of all, modernizing infrastructure, \r\nmanaging resources efficiently, promoting a green \r\neconomy and renewable energy and applying modern \r\ntechnologies in agriculture. We have also undertaken to \r\nreform the public administration and the public services, \r\nwhile ensuring gender equality and the promotion \r\nof youth. We have the political will needed to fully \r\nimplement those reforms, and in that endeavour we \r\nwill continue to rely on the support of our development \r\npartners, particularly the European Union and the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe Republic of Moldova fully shares the view that \r\nthe prevention and peaceful settlement of conflicts, in \r\nparticular protracted ones, are indispensable conditions \r\nfor implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Considering the current lack of progress \r\nin settling protracted conflicts, there should be more \r\ndirect involvement on the part of the appropriate United \r\nNations bodies. We believe that no conflict in the world \r\nshould be ignored by the United Nations, irrespective \r\nof whether it is on the Security Council’s agenda or not.\r\nWe appreciate the fact that the General Assembly \r\nhas agreed to include and maintain on its agenda the \r\nitem entitled “Protracted conflicts in the GUAM area \r\nand their implications for international peace, security \r\nand development”. Contrary to the fears of some, the \r\nGeneral Assembly’s deliberations on that item do not \r\nundermine the existing mechanisms for negotiating the \r\nsettlement of conflicts in the area of the Organization \r\nfor Democracy and Economic Development, made up \r\nof Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and the Republic of \r\nMoldova (GUAM). On the contrary, it is the continued \r\nmonitoring of the situation in the area, together with \r\na proactive approach by the United Nations when its \r\ninvolvement is needed, that can prevent or counter \r\nattempts aimed at changing the political borders of \r\nsome GUAM States through methods that have nothing \r\nto do with democracy and international law.\r\nI take this opportunity to express the Republic \r\nof Moldova’s deep concern about the ongoing armed \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 11/26\r\nconflict in eastern Ukraine, which endangers peace and \r\nsecurity in our region, and to once again reiterate our \r\nfull support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial \r\nintegritye.\r\nSince 1992, we have repeatedly referred from this \r\nrostrum to the unresolved conflict in the eastern part \r\nof the Republic of Moldova, which is also complicated \r\nby the illegal stationing of foreign military forces on \r\nour national territory. We have underlined that, unlike \r\nother, similar conflicts in the post-Soviet space, the \r\nTransnistrian conflict, while less intricate, could \r\nbe resolved more easily if all the parties concerned \r\ndisplayed the necessary political will. In our case, there \r\nis no ethnic or religious enmity, and the populations \r\non both banks of the Nistru River could live in peace \r\nand mutual understanding within a reintegrated \r\nMoldovan State.\r\nDespite our efforts over the past 25 years, including \r\nthe involvement of international actors, we have not \r\nsucceeded in settling this political conflict. We will \r\ncontinue to work to come up with a solution in the \r\nexisting 5+2 settlement format. For us, it is extremely \r\nimportant that the solution be based on respect for the \r\nsovereignty and territorial integrity of the Republic \r\nof Moldova, while providing a special status for the \r\nTransnistrian region, as stipulated in the relevant \r\ndocuments of the Organization for Security and \r\nCooperation in Europe (OSCE).\r\nWe firmly believe that the settlement process could \r\nbe based on the transformation of the current trilateral \r\npeacekeeping force, which also includes a Russian \r\ncontingent, into a multinational civilian mission with \r\nan international mandate. In that regard, I would like \r\nto emphasize that the trilateral disengagement force \r\nestablished in accordance with the Moldovan-Russian \r\nceasefire agreement of 21 July 1992 fulfilled its remit \r\nlong ago. That obsolete mechanism has become a factor \r\nin preserving the conflict and has failed to ensure the \r\nfull demilitarization of the security zone and eliminate \r\nobstacles to the free movement of people, goods \r\nand services.\r\nContrary to our expectations, the Russian Federation \r\nhas not yet withdrawn its military forces from the \r\nterritory of the Republic of Moldova, in accordance \r\nwith its international commitments as stipulated in the \r\nMoldovan-Russian ceasefire agreement of July 1992, \r\nthe Moldovan-Russian agreement of October 1994 \r\nand in the relevant OSCE documents, in particular \r\nthe political declaration adopted at the OSCE Istanbul \r\nSummit in 1999.\r\nI would like to make it clear that those military \r\nforces are distinct and should not be confused with the \r\nRussian contingent that participates in the trilateral \r\npeacekeeping force, which is operating on the basis of an \r\nad hoc arrangement. The military exercises conducted \r\nregularly in the Transnistrian region by Russian troops, \r\nwith the increased participation of paramilitary forces \r\nbelonging to the separatist regime in Tiraspol, pose a \r\ncontinuing security threat to the Republic of Moldova. \r\nThe joint military drills are in f lagrant violation of \r\nexpress obligations stipulated in the Moldovan-Russian \r\nceasefire agreement of 1992.\r\nAccording to OSCE reports, the Operative Group of \r\nRussian Troops has stockpiled more than 21,000 metric \r\ntons of weapons and ammunition. The Government \r\nof the Republic of Moldova neither controls nor \r\nsupervises those weapons and munitions. Due to the \r\ncomplete lack of access to those foreign-controlled \r\nstockpiles — some of which may pose substantial \r\nenvironmental danger — the munitions’ technical \r\ncondition cannot be assessed and transfers of them \r\nwithin that territory or outside it cannot be monitored.\r\nFor the same reasons, the Republic of Moldova \r\nis unable to fulfil its international obligations as a \r\nState party under various international disarmament \r\nconventions. Although they are located on the territory \r\nof the Republic of Moldova, those weapons and \r\nmunitions are not under its jurisdiction or control. \r\nTaking into account the commitments of the Russian \r\nFederation, the fundamental principles of international \r\nlaw and the provisions of the Constitution of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova regarding its permanently neutral \r\nstatus and its non-admission of the deployment of \r\nother States’ military troops on its national territory, \r\nwe firmly reiterate our request for the complete and \r\nunconditional withdrawal of the so-called Operative \r\nGroup of Russian Troops, a successor to the former \r\nfourteenth Soviet army, which is illegally stationed \r\non the territory of the Republic of Moldova. In that \r\ncontext, I should also invoke the declaration on 21 July \r\nby the Parliament of the Republic of Moldova that calls \r\non the Russian Federation to resume and finalize the \r\nprocess of withdrawing its troops and munitions from \r\nthe territory of the Republic of Moldova.\r\nMindful that the United Nations has the primary \r\nresponsibility for the maintenance of peace and \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n12/26 17-29710\r\nsecurity, the Republic of Moldova, in accordance \r\nwith Article 11 of the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nrequests the inclusion on the agenda of the seventy-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly of a new \r\nitem entitled “Withdrawal of foreign military forces \r\nfrom the territory of the Republic of Moldova.” In that \r\nregard, I respectfully call on all States Members of \r\nthe United Nations to support that legitimate request, \r\nwhich is fully compliant with the principles of the \r\nCharter and represents the fundamental interests of the \r\nRepublic of Moldova. We hope that the inclusion of that \r\nitem on the General Assembly’s agenda and its further \r\nconsideration by Member States in a constructive and \r\nnon-politicized manner, will constitute an important \r\nand necessary exercise in preventive diplomacy, in a \r\ncountry and a region where the maintenance of peace \r\nand security is persistently undermined by a lack of \r\ndialogue based on mutual respect and respect for the \r\nfundamental principles of international law.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Moldova for the \r\nstatement he has just made,\r\nMr. Pavel Filip, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nMoldova, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Belgium\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Belgium.\r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Charles \r\nMichel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Michel (Belgium) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express our support to the \r\nvictims of the recent hurricanes as well as those of the \r\nearthquakes in Mexico. Such natural disasters brutally \r\ndestroy lives and dreams and bring about instability \r\nand insecurity. Above all, however, such tragedies are \r\nakin to a warning shot. They remind us of the utter \r\nurgency of the need to work together against global \r\nwarming. In that regard, I would like to welcome and \r\nsupport the initiative undertaken by French President \r\nEmmanuel Macron in the wake of the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change aimed at establishing a genuine and \r\nfar-reaching compact for the environment.\r\nUnquestionably, we can no longer postpone what \r\nwe need to do today. For many countries, in particular \r\nthe island States in the Pacific, the Indian Ocean \r\nand the Caribbean, such natural phenomena have an \r\nimmediate impact on their survival. We must bequeath \r\nour children a planet where they can live and breathe, \r\nenriched by biological diversity. Let us use the best of \r\nour intelligence and our ability to innovate in order to \r\nrise to that existential challenge.\r\nWe all want a better world. We want to fight \r\nrelentlessly against all forms of injustice, inequality \r\nand discrimination, whether on the basis of skin \r\ncolour, religion, gender, culture of sexual orientation. \r\nAnd we all want to advance universal fundamental \r\nfreedoms. When we want the best for our countries \r\nand for our fellow citizens, there can be no question \r\nof the importance of the freedom of the press and of \r\nexpression. All too often, elections are manipulated, \r\njustice is undermined, corruption is widespread and \r\nthere is a purposeful lack of transparency. Both national \r\nand international institutions must guarantee personal \r\nfreedoms and work constantly to achieve emancipation \r\nand greater dignity for all. Of course, sovereignty must \r\nbe fully respected, but it cannot be used as a shield \r\nor an excuse for attempting to legitimize atrocities or \r\nforce submission.\r\nThis is not a lecture on morals or about dictating, \r\nby will or force, a ready-made model democracy. \r\nThis is about convincing others, through steady and \r\nconstant dialogue, of the need to unreservedly defend \r\nour universal values on behalf of each and every human \r\nbeing, no matter where they are from or where they \r\nare going. Diplomatic ruptures have never helped to \r\nadvance universal values, and abandoning dialogue \r\nis often an act of cowardice that also abandons those \r\nfighting for greater freedom in their country.\r\nWe all want a safer world. Peace, security and \r\nstability are the best ways to guarantee that we can all \r\nlive our lives to the full, having enough to eat, having \r\nwork, having a home and being able to send our children \r\nto school. Yet still today there are too many conflicts, \r\nwars and hatred tearing hopes and dreams apart.\r\nNo continent is spared the scourge of terrorism. \r\nFomenting hatred and spreading the poison of division \r\nis the grim goal of terrorists, whose senseless, barbaric \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 13/26\r\nacts of murder destroy families’ futures. None of us can \r\nremain indifferent to that, and my country is therefore \r\nparticipating, with others, in the Global Coalition \r\nagainst Da’esh. Military forces on the ground have \r\nforced Da’esh to retreat in Iraq and Syria, and we are \r\ncommitted to supporting the countries that have been \r\ndestroyed in their efforts to rebuild.\r\nBut we must always continue the fight to protect \r\nour universal values of freedom, tolerance, respect \r\nand non-discrimination. Our desire to live together \r\nin harmony despite our differences and with respect \r\nfor each other’s cultures and customs must prevail. In \r\nthat regard, I would like to recall the wise and ever-\r\npertinent words of Gandhi, who said that if we answer \r\nhatred with hatred, we only spread it.\r\nAnother threat to world security is the uncontrolled \r\nproliferation of arms, particularly nuclear weapons. \r\nWhile the world is in turmoil and there are numerous \r\nconflict zones, the most lasting and mutually beneficial \r\nsolutions will always be political and diplomatic in \r\nnature rather than military. The agreement concluded \r\nafter several years of intense negotiations with \r\nIran on the nuclear issue must be safeguarded and \r\nimplemented. My country has many major differences \r\nwith Iran but the agreement is nonetheless a channel for \r\ndialogue aimed at reducing tensions and threats. It is \r\nan opportunity to agree on our goals and deal with our \r\ndifferences peacefully. Rejecting it without proposing \r\nany alternative seems neither wise nor desirable.\r\nThe situation in North Korea is also enlightening \r\non this issue. In contrast to the situation with Iran, \r\nhere there was no continuous process of dialogue and \r\nnegotiation. The result has been a dangerous escalation \r\nthat is jeopardizing peace and security. We condemn \r\nthe country’s autocratic and provocative regime, but \r\nmerely condemning it is not enough. We should all \r\nmobilize in order to prepare the ground for dialogue, \r\nincluding invoking the responsibility borne by such \r\nactors as China and Russia.\r\nEconomic development must serve social cohesion. \r\nGrowth rates, even in double figures, are not necessarily \r\na guarantee of the fair and equitable distribution of \r\nwealth. Capitalism is a means, nothing more or less, for \r\nserving social and economic development. We support \r\nfree trade and we want an open global economy. The \r\nfree f low of goods, services and knowledge should \r\npromote shared development and progress. Sustainable \r\ndevelopment is not possible without development, and we \r\ncannot eradicate poverty without increasing prosperity. \r\nFree enterprise must be geared to the true economy, the \r\nproduction of good and services and job creation. We \r\nmust strengthen the middle classes everywhere. This \r\nis not about the survival of the fittest or having the \r\nlaw of jungle imposed on us. It is about distinguishing \r\nbetween investment and speculation. Investment, as \r\nopposed to financial speculation, is a responsible and \r\nvirtuous activity that benefits society as a whole and \r\nstimulates innovation and progress.\r\nThroughout history, freedom of movement and \r\nfree trade have brought people closer together. Those \r\nprinciples have been at the heart of the European \r\nproject for 60 years. The European Union negotiates \r\ntreaties with various partners all over the world, \r\nincluding Canada and Japan. Those treaties include \r\nsocial and environmental provisions. That openness to \r\nthe world, accompanied by rules and regulations, is the \r\nmost concrete response we can make to isolationism \r\nand protectionism. History has shown us, time and \r\nagain, that barriers and walls between peoples are \r\nillusory — they always give way to our natural thirst \r\nfor freedom, openness and innovation.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda defines an ambitious framework \r\nfor achieving the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nby promoting private initiative, strengthening the \r\nrule of law, encouraging education for boys and girls \r\nalike, developing agriculture and building on good \r\ngovernance. Those actions constitute the best recipe \r\nfor preventing conflict and creating a better, fairer and \r\nstronger world.\r\nCountries in the South as well as the North are all \r\nconcerned with the issue of migration. Belgium is a \r\nland that welcomes people seeking asylum and f leeing \r\nwars and persecution. And we will fight the faithless \r\nand lawless traffickers who put women and children \r\nin makeshift boats to embark on a journey towards an \r\nall too often tragic outcome. We must be on the side \r\nof those who suffer. Development in the countries of \r\norigin is the key. We must invest in the least developed \r\ncountries. We remain firmly committed to concluding \r\na global compact for safe, orderly and regular migration \r\nby 2018. We advocate for a comprehensive approach \r\nthat facilitates legal migration and enables people to \r\nreturn to their countries of origin, while ensuring their \r\nindividual security.\r\nMultilateralism is a robust and reliable engine for \r\nbuilding a better world. Coordination and consensus-\r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n14/26 17-29710\r\nbuilding are required. However, the essence of the \r\nUnited Nations is sometimes called into question. \r\nGlobalization generates doubts and fears. Yet \r\nmultilateralism does not cause such disruptions; on the \r\ncontrary, it is frequently the best solution to them.\r\nWe must respect our independence, but at the same \r\ntime we must also recognize our interdependence and \r\nuphold the virtues of concerted action. We must work \r\ntirelessly to build a consensus in which all nations, large \r\nand small, have their roles to play and, in that way, have \r\na say. Belgium is fully behind the Secretary-General’s \r\nvision for reforming the Organization, not because \r\nreform is an end in itself, but because the world today \r\ndemands more determined and results-oriented action.\r\nMultilateralism is a complex task, with occasional \r\nobstacles and frequent frustrations. However, there are \r\nalso successes of which we speak too little. In Colombia, \r\nfor example, concerted action has put an end to one of \r\nthe longest conflicts in the world. Multilateralism also \r\nrequires a comprehensive, inclusive and sustainable \r\napproach. Prevention, conflict resolution and \r\npeacebuilding must be seen as part of a continuum. \r\nInternational and regional consultation must also be \r\nstrengthened. As we know, when regional actors and \r\nthe United Nations are aligned and working together in \r\nthe same direction, great things can happen.\r\nIn the Great Lakes region of Central Africa, the \r\ncountries of the region have a decisive role to play. In \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, the security \r\nsituation has deteriorated considerably and the \r\nhumanitarian crisis is worrying. But even as the debate \r\non the cost of peacekeeping operations has begun, we \r\ncannot abandon the Democratic Republic of the Congo. \r\nOn the contrary, we must support it so that it can anchor \r\nitself in an irreversible democratic process, including \r\nby holding honest, transparent and inclusive elections. \r\nThe destinies of Africa and Europe have always been \r\nlinked. Challenges to one are challenges to the other, \r\nwhether we are talking about security, migration or \r\neven development. We must work to achieve a less \r\ncomplicated relationship, liberated from the demons of \r\nthe past and functioning on a peer-to-peer level, while \r\nwe look to the future.\r\nIn the Middle East, we continue to advocate for a \r\ntwo-State solution for Israel and Palestine. As far as \r\nSyria is concerned, that endless conflict can end only \r\nwhen the international community as a whole shows its \r\npolitical will and develops a genuine common strategy.\r\nCombating impunity and strengthening \r\ninternational justice are at the heart of Belgium’s \r\npriorities, and we will continue to work for them An \r\nexample of such efforts is the amendments to the Rome \r\nStatute of the International Criminal Court. We want to \r\nencourage cooperation among States in order to combat \r\nimpunity for the most serious international crimes. In \r\nthat regard, we call on all States that have not yet done \r\nso to support an initiative to launch the negotiation of a \r\nnew treaty on mutual assistance and extradition.\r\nOur shared goal for the United Nations must be \r\nworking every day to build an efficient Organization \r\nthat serves the common interests of the Member States. \r\nThe key to success lies in the art of compromise and \r\nthe ability listen actively — and in having the strength \r\nof conviction to bring that about. My country’s \r\ntransparent and constructive attitude is reaping results \r\nthat benefit everyone. Belgium is a land of compromise. \r\nIt is in that spirit that we are currently a candidate for \r\na non-permanent seat on the Security Council. Based \r\non our international roots and experience, we are ready \r\nto assume the responsibilities of building consensus \r\nand acting for peace. As the philosopher Jean-Jacques \r\nRousseau said, man can make his happiness only \r\nby working for that of others. We stand ready to get \r\nto work.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Belgium for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Charles Michel, Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Belgium, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Lyonchoen Tshering Tobgay, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Kingdom of Bhutan.\r\nMr. Lyonchoen Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Bhutan, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I \r\nhave great pleasure in welcoming His Excellency \r\nMr. Lyonchoen Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Kingdom of Bhutan, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Tobgay (Bhutan): I bring warm greetings from \r\nHis Majesty the Druk Gyalpo.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 15/26\r\nToday my thoughts are with the people of Mexico, \r\nwho suffered two terrible earthquakes this month. My \r\nthoughts are also with the victims of the other natural \r\ndisasters that have recently brought pain and misery to \r\npeople around the world — the three hurricanes that \r\nbattered communities in the Caribbean and the United \r\nStates and the devastating f loods in Bangladesh, India, \r\nNepal and Sri Lanka that have taken more than 1,200 \r\nlives. Please join me in observing a moment of silence \r\nto reflect on the suffering of those communities and to \r\noffer our prayers for their recovery.\r\nThe disasters I just referred to are not isolated \r\nincidents. Experts are increasingly convinced that \r\nnatural disasters like hurricanes and f loods are made \r\nworse by climate change. Climate change is a reality. \r\nEach of the past three years has been the hottest in \r\nrecorded history, and 16 of the 17 hottest years on \r\nrecord have all occurred in this new century. That must \r\nalarm us, for we are only in 2017. There is no room for \r\ncomplacency, hesitation or finger-pointing, excuses or \r\nprocrastination. The urgency is now. Our well-being is \r\nat stake. The survival of future generations is at risk. \r\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change is proof that \r\nwe have accepted that climate change is a reality, and \r\nthat we are willing to come together, to work together \r\nand to fight climate change together. I urge all countries \r\nto fulfil the promises they made in Paris.\r\nAs a landlocked, mountainous country, we are \r\nespecially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. \r\nThat is why we are particularly alarmed about unchecked \r\nenvironmental degradation, which is the root cause \r\nof climate change. We are already experiencing f lash \r\nf loods, glacial lake outbursts and severe and erratic \r\nweather patterns, whsoe effects can be particularly \r\ndevastating for a poor country.\r\nBut we will not give up. We will take action. We \r\nhave ratified the Paris Agreement and are well on our \r\nway to fulfilling our pledges. A total of 72 per cent \r\nof our country is under forest cover, and more than \r\nhalf of it is protected as national parkland, wildlife \r\nsanctuaries or nature reserves. That means that we are \r\nthe world’s only carbon-neutral country. In fact, we are \r\na carbon-negative country. In addition, we generate \r\nand export clean renewable energy and invest in green \r\nindustries and organic farming practices.\r\nAfter centuries of neglect, fighting climate change \r\nis complex and expensive. That is why it is critical \r\nto ensure that all countries fulfil their respective \r\ncommitments. But that takes money; hence the \r\nimportance of climate financing mechanisms. However, \r\nsecuring financing is one of the biggest challenges that \r\nsmaller nations have, and the role of climate-financing \r\ninstitutions is therefore essential. We applaud the Global \r\nEnvironmental Facility (GEF) for financing more than \r\n4,000 environmental projects in 170 countries since its \r\nestablishment in the 1990s. The Green Climate Fund \r\n(GCF) has also begun to help developing countries \r\naround the world respond to climate change through \r\ninnovative and transformative interventions. Those \r\ninstitutions are critical for those who have the will but \r\nmay not have the resources to take action. I applaud \r\nthe innovative strategies and interventions that they \r\nhave supported.\r\nFor our part, in partnership with the World Wildlife \r\nFund we have launched Bhutan for Life, an innovative \r\nfinancing mechanism that will help safeguard our rich \r\nbiodiversity until our Government can assume the full \r\ncost of its protection.\r\nNow is the time to scale up our support to the GEF \r\nand GCF. That will enable all countries to fight climate \r\nchange on a war footing and help developing countries \r\nrespond to its effects. I am optimistic that we will be \r\nable to prevent the worst effects of climate change. But \r\nfor that we have to work together. While the threat of \r\nnatural disasters will always remain, we can and must \r\nensure that they are not directly linked to human-\r\ninduced activity.\r\nThe World Bank estimates that more than \r\n800 million people live in poverty. For them, hunger, \r\nmalnourishment and deprivation are everyday realities. \r\nAnd that reality — the scourge of poverty — silently \r\nkills countless millions every year. I ask members to \r\nplease join me in observing a moment of silence for \r\nthe millions of people around the world, particularly \r\nchildren, who are suffering or dying from poverty \r\nand malnourishment.\r\nPoverty has no place in this day and age. After all, \r\nthis era — our era — is blessed with unprecedented \r\nwealth, knowledge and technology, giving rise to levels \r\nof prosperity the world has never seen before. Yet \r\nmillions are still condemned to a life of poverty. The \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are critical in \r\nthat regard. They give us reason for hope. While every \r\none of the 17 Goals will contribute to eradicating the \r\nscourge of poverty, our common resolve is articulated \r\npowerfully in the very first Goal of the SDGs, which \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n16/26 17-29710\r\npromises nothing less than to end poverty everywhere \r\nand in all its forms.\r\nEradicating poverty, like dealing with climate \r\nchange, is complex and expensive. But according to one \r\nestimate, it would take only $175 billion per year to end \r\nextreme poverty. That should come as good news, since \r\nit is barely 0.32 per cent of the current global gross \r\ndomestic product. We no doubt have a lot of work to \r\ndo, but the SDGs provide a realistic road map for this \r\nimportant task. However, there are no easy shortcuts.\r\nIn that connection, the Secretary-General’s \r\nreform initiatives will ensure that the United Nations \r\nis fit for purpose and able to respond to the call for \r\ntransformation in order to bring about shared prosperity \r\nfor all peoples of the world. I thank him for initiating \r\nsuch bold measures, and call on all Member States to \r\ngive full support to the important reforms.\r\nWe in Bhutan are blessed. Our enlightened \r\nmonarchs have carefully balanced economic growth \r\nwith social development, environmental sustainability \r\nand cultural preservation, all within a framework \r\nof good governance. We call this holistic approach \r\nto development Gross National Happiness, a unique \r\nphilosophy that guarantees all of our citizens free \r\neducation and free health care, while providing \r\nadditional targeted interventions for the poor.\r\nI am happy to report that our efforts are bearing \r\nfruit. Multidimensional poverty has already fallen by \r\nhalf, and we are well on our way to reducing it still \r\nfurther, to 5 per cent within the next few years. Our \r\nsuccess in reducing poverty is a tribute to the leadership \r\nof our kings and the spirit of the people of Bhutan.\r\nIt is also due to the support of the United Nations \r\nand our other development partners, particularly India, \r\nJapan, the European Union, the Asian Development \r\nBank and the World Bank. Their continued support, \r\npartnership and generosity have helped us reduce \r\npoverty, achieve social growth and prepare for imminent \r\ngraduation from the least-developed-country category.\r\nI now ask everyone to join me in observing a moment \r\nof silence to remember the victims of global terrorism.\r\nRecent acts of terrorism have brought pain and \r\nsuffering to countless people in nearly every part of \r\nthe world, and far too many lives have been cruelly \r\nlost. The horrific acts committed by terrorist groups \r\nundermine global peace and security, and Bhutan joins \r\nthe call for united action to combat those extremists. To \r\nwin the fight against terrorism, we have no option but \r\nto strengthen the United Nations so that multilateralism \r\nand global cooperation are further enhanced.\r\nTwo years ago, I joined many others in calling for \r\nUnited Nations reform (see A/70/PV.26). The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform initiatives will provide a much-\r\nneeded framework for revitalizing and strengthening \r\nthe United Nations. Bhutan joins all Member States in \r\nbacking that bold endeavour.\r\nBut any United Nations reform would be \r\nincomplete without reforming the Security Council \r\nto reflect the changing realities of today’s world. In \r\nthat regard, countries like India, Japan, Brazil and \r\nGermany must be called on to serve as permanent \r\nmembers in the Security Council, and Africa must also \r\nbe appropriately represented.\r\nWe recognize that global peace and security are \r\na shared concern and responsibility. As a peaceful \r\ncountry, one that has enjoyed the benefits of United \r\nNations membership for more than four decades, we \r\nfeel it is now time for us to contribute to global peace \r\nand security, if only modestly. Accordingly, it was with \r\na sense of pride and duty in 2014 that Bhutan joined the \r\npeacekeeping movement. Since then, we have gradually \r\nincreased our peacekeeping engagement in keeping \r\nwith our duty to contribute, albeit in a small way, to \r\nthe cause of global peace and security. In doing so our \r\npeacekeepers have and always will uphold the highest \r\nstandards of integrity, ethics and professionalism \r\nwhile discharging their important responsibilities. \r\nOur military and police officers today serve in 11 \r\npeacekeeping missions, and the first-ever military \r\ncontingent from Bhutan is now ready to be deployed to \r\na peacekeeping mission.\r\nHowever, the bedrock of global peace and \r\nsecurity ultimately lies within each and every one \r\nof our individual countries. Every country must \r\ntherefore protect the rights of its citizens, strengthen \r\nparticipatory democracy and participatory Government \r\nand enable economic opportunity for all. Those are the \r\nvery principles of democracy and freedom. They must \r\nbe nurtured and strengthened.\r\nNine years ago, Bhutan embarked on the path \r\nof democracy. In an unprecedented move in human \r\nhistory, our King, at the height of his popularity, \r\nimposed democracy, against the will of his people. After \r\na century of peace and prosperity under enlightened \r\nmonarchs, there was much apprehension and fear. But \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 17/26\r\nnine years on, it gives me great satisfaction to report \r\nthat democracy in Bhutan is well entrenched and \r\nirreversible. Today all the institutions of democratic \r\ngovernance have been established and are functioning \r\nwell, along with a growing body of civil society and a \r\nstrong and vibrant media. We held successful elections \r\nin 2008 and 2013, and look forward to a third election \r\nnext year, in 2018.\r\nThe importance of the United Nations has never \r\nbeen greater, and the imperative for multilateralism \r\nhas never been stronger. As we look to the future, \r\nBhutan will continue working with all Member \r\nStates to ensure that the United Nations continues to \r\nplay an instrumental role in fighting climate change, \r\neradicating poverty and maintaining global peace and \r\nsecurity. In that regard, I have the honour to conclude \r\nwith a quotation from our beloved King, His Majesty \r\nJigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck:\r\n“No nation today can stand alone in \r\nachievement. Time is slowly telling us that there can \r\nbe no lasting individual success without success as \r\na community, and there cannot be lasting national \r\nprogress and success if it does not fit into a future \r\nof global peace, harmony and equality. The world \r\nmust progress together or fail together.”\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Bhutan for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Lyoncheon Tshering Tobgay, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Bhutan, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Republic of Albania\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Albania.\r\nMr. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Edi \r\nRama, Prime Minister of the Republic of Albania, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Rama (Albania): How many times has it \r\nhappened that humankind has been confronted with as \r\nmany complex challenges in such a relatively short time \r\nas is the case nowadays? Has there ever been another \r\nperiod in what we call modern times when we have had \r\nto deal with so many pressing issues at once? When was \r\nthe last time we remember that we were all confronted \r\nwith such a conflicting prospect — on the one hand, of \r\nan inspiring world that grows richer by the hour, driven \r\nby the tremendous progress of science and technology, \r\nand on the other of a planet that seems to have lost \r\nits way, its energy and its vision and to be spiralling \r\nerratically downwards?\r\nThere are no simple answers to complex questions. \r\nYet facts are stubborn, and in many respects reality \r\nlooks grim. Global terrorism and extremism continue \r\nto threaten our values and our way of life. They have \r\nbecome a persistent threat, with the ability to strike \r\neverywhere, indiscriminately and with far-reaching \r\nconsequences, as we have sadly witnessed so many \r\ntimes, including in the recent past. Several brutal and \r\nseemingly intractable conflicts continue to devastate \r\nthe lives of millions of people, thereby threatening \r\nthe future of entire generations. Armed conflicts are \r\nnowadays more complex, the actors involved more \r\nnumerous, the weapons and tactics more sophisticated \r\nand the consequences, which continue to inflict endless \r\nhuman suffering, more dire. The approximately \r\n65 million people, the highest number since the Second \r\nWorld War, who have been forcefully and brutally \r\nuprooted from their homes constitute an indictment of \r\nour collective failure.\r\nClimate change, a defiant truth that some still \r\ndare to question, is putting our very survival at risk. It \r\nconstitutes one the most fundamental challenges for our \r\ncentury, as it continues to cause growing humanitarian \r\nstress. Disasters are becoming more frequent and \r\nintense, and one example, the current hurricane season \r\nin the Atlantic, reminds us that nature will always have \r\nthe upper hand unless we become aware of the need to \r\nquickly adapt our way of life and protect our planet, our \r\nlives and those of our children.\r\nThe international global order has been seriously \r\nchallenged without anything credible or promising to \r\nreplace it. Worse, the situation in North-East Asia, a \r\nprolonged and recently exacerbated crisis sparked \r\nby the policy of a stubborn and paranoid totalitarian \r\nregime, has brought back the dreadful fear of nuclear \r\nconfrontation. Inequality has continued to grow, \r\nwhile, in contrast, the world becomes wealthier, which \r\ncasts serious doubt on the validity of promises and \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n18/26 17-29710\r\nguarantees of positive results for the benefit of all so \r\noften advocated for from this very rostrum.\r\nNo country, however large, rich or powerful, can \r\nface or solve such problems alone. The challenges \r\nrequire a unified vision and a concerted response. In an \r\nincreasingly globalized world, our visions and actions \r\nshould be inclusive and universal and bring people, \r\ncommunities and countries together. As the leader of a \r\nsmall nation, I hereby reiterate our pledge that we will \r\nfaithfully do our part.\r\nThe increase in violent extremism and the number \r\nof non-State armed groups perpetrating atrocities, \r\nparticularly against ethnic and religious minorities, \r\ncontinue to represent one of our most pressing challenges. \r\nThe decisive action taken by the international coalition \r\nhas paid off. The Islamic State in Iraq and the Sham \r\n(ISIS) has lost almost 90 per cent of the territory it once \r\ncontrolled, and its ability to wage war has been severely \r\ndiminished. Yet let us make no mistake; its defeat on \r\nthe ground does not mean that it will disappear. Our \r\nresponse to the extremism and radicalization that leads \r\nto terrorism must continue and adapt to the nature of \r\nthat persistent threat itself. Albania was among the \r\nfirst countries to join the Global Coalition in the fight \r\nagainst ISIS and international terrorism. We are now \r\nimplementing a three-year action plan as an instrument \r\nfor implementing our national strategy on countering \r\nviolent extremism.\r\nWe welcome the increased attention that has been \r\ngiven to the role of regional organizations in security \r\nissues. In that respect, we greatly appreciate and \r\nwelcome the close cooperation between the United \r\nNations and the European Union (EU) on the Common \r\nSecurity and Defence Policy platform.\r\nAll over the world, people want to be safe and free \r\nfrom violence, oppression, persecution and fear. They \r\nwant to be treated with dignity and know that their lives \r\nmatter, regardless of gender, race, national or social \r\norigin, religious belief, political affiliation, property, \r\nbirth or any other status. To achieve those goals, we \r\nneed to go beyond declaratory undertakings. People \r\nrightly demand us to show responsibility and an ability \r\nto act. The pledge to leave no one behind is the central \r\ntheme of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nAlbania is fully committed to protecting and \r\npromoting all human rights, particularly women’s \r\nrights, which is another major battle for change that my \r\nGovernment is leading. I am proud to announce that, \r\nfor the second time in a row in Albanian history, half of \r\nthe members of my Government are women. They bring \r\nleadership skills, strength of character, commitment to \r\nour European values and special devotion to serving \r\nthe Albanian people.\r\nFurthermore, women count for approximately \r\n30 per cent of the members of our Parliament and more \r\nthan 45 per cent of our public administration. Those \r\nmay sound like mere statistics, but they rather reflect \r\na platform that ensures that the role of women in \r\ndevelopment and change is recognized, their rightful \r\nplace in the society is secured and their voice is heard. \r\nIt is my deep belief that the empowerment of women \r\nserves as a powerful driver of overall economic \r\ndevelopment and national prosperity.\r\nOne of the main national priorities for my country \r\nis to join the European Union. It is not just one of \r\nour foreign policy objectives and is not a contractual \r\nrelation of sorts. For us, European integration lies at the \r\nheart of our overall development, since it touches every \r\ncell of our development architecture.\r\nWe are resolved to deliver on the fundamentals \r\nthat consolidate the pillars of a democratic State, a \r\nfunctioning economy and a Government that works \r\nfor its citizens. We want to measure our progress with \r\nresults, and the very thorough justice reform we are \r\nimplementing is a shining example of that.\r\nIn turn, we expect our EU partners to do their part \r\nand to clear the way towards finally opening accession \r\ntalks. It will be a historic milestone, but also a strong \r\nencouragement for us to continue on the same path. \r\nWe hope that the European Union, despite the current \r\ncrisis, continues to believe that the enlargement process \r\nremains the best European catalyst for security, peace, \r\ndevelopment and prosperity. It has proved so in the past \r\nand remains the right bet for the future.\r\nA couple of months ago, at the general elections, I \r\nwas re-elected as Head of Government by the citizens \r\nof Albania. They have agreed with our plans for the \r\nAlbania we want. Expectations are high, and so is \r\nour resolve to meet them. Our target is to ensure a \r\nsustainable economic growth of 5 per cent during my \r\ncurrent mandate.\r\nThat brings me to one of my favourite \r\nsubjects — the development of regional cooperation \r\nand the transformation of the Western Balkans into an \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 19/26\r\narea of free movement for people, goods, capitals and \r\nideas, benefiting everyone in the region. That remains \r\none of the main pillars of our foreign policy.\r\nThere were times in the past when we would come \r\nhere and spend time and energy competing with some \r\nof our neighbours on how to belittle each other, telling \r\nour one-sided stories and trying to convince the world \r\nof our specific narratives. Hopefully, that is long gone. \r\nThe best proof of the profound change in the Western \r\nBalkans lies in our joint efforts, with a shared sense \r\nof responsibility and a common purpose to make the \r\nregion a natural part of Europe.\r\nTogether with the European Union, and based on its \r\nprinciples and policies, we are working to bring down \r\nevery barrier to free trade by encouraging transnational \r\neconomies. A new and vibrant regional economic area, \r\nwhich we agreed on in July in Trieste, will boost trade \r\nand benefit our economies. I do not have the slightest \r\ndoubt that it will help us to protect and promote \r\neveryone’s national interests, respect the rights of \r\nminorities, strengthen good neighbourly relations and \r\nmove our countries and the region as a whole towards \r\nthe European Union.\r\nStrong and healthy relations with the European \r\nUnion have proved key to stability and reform progress \r\nin the Balkans. We have noticed that when the EU is \r\noverly preoccupied with itself, that bond is fragile and \r\ninsecure. That is why this important relationship should \r\nbe continually nurtured and strengthened, because \r\nit also facilitates regional cooperation, increased \r\nunderstanding and work towards reconciliation in the \r\nbest European tradition and record.\r\nAs President Junker stated just a few weeks ago in \r\nhis address on the state of the European Union, there \r\nis need for a credible enlargement perspective so that \r\nthe Western Balkans can attain more stability in the \r\nEU. Revitalizing the enlargement policy will be the \r\nbest deterrent to the disintegration narrative that is \r\nfuelled by populist ideas. It is my firm belief that as \r\nmuch as we need the European Union, the European \r\nUnion needs a stronger, more developed and coherent \r\nWestern Balkans.\r\nWe are well aware of that. And practice has shown \r\nthat in order to build a fully functioning region, all of \r\nits members must be treated the same way. That is why \r\nwe think that the admission of Kosovo to every regional \r\nbody, with the same rights as other countries, is of \r\nparamount significance. Many have used the Assembly \r\nover the past years to express worries and fear that \r\nKosovo’s independence would unleash dark forces that \r\nno one would be able to control. We have seen nothing \r\nof the sort. Instead, what has really happened it that \r\nAlbanians in Kosovo and Albania, as well as Serbs, \r\nonce threatened with extermination by a brutal regime, \r\nare now free citizens living in democratic countries and \r\ncontributing to further developing an open society.\r\nWho can deny the impressive achievements made \r\nby Kosovo in less than a decade of independence? \r\nThey include the consolidation of its democratic \r\ninstitutions, good governance, exemplary multi-ethnic \r\nand interreligious coexistence and evident progress in \r\nthe Euro-Atlantic integration process. Every credible \r\nreport on the current situation in the Western Balkans \r\nwould undoubtedly lead to the same conclusion — today \r\nthe Western Balkans is far better off than it was three or \r\nfive years ago, let alone 10. Kosovo’s independence has \r\nnot unleashed any dark forces. On the contrary, it has \r\nbrought stability to the entire region.\r\nFor several years, Serbia and Kosovo have been \r\nengaged in serious dialogue on the normalization of \r\ntheir relations, with the mediation and facilitation of the \r\nEuropean Union. After centuries of mistrust, a climate \r\nof trust and regional cooperation for both countries is a \r\ngrowing reality. That serves as an even greater reason \r\nto remind those countries that have not yet recognized \r\nKosovo to consider doing so as soon as possible. That \r\nshould not be seen as defiance or a loss, as it is often \r\nwrongly portrayed. We have said it before and we will \r\nsay it again: recognizing Kosovo, establishing relations \r\nand helping Kosovo move forward, which is something \r\nthat 114 Member States have done so far, constitute a \r\ndirect contribution to bettering the lives of Kosovo’s \r\ncitizens and investing in the security and stability of the \r\nwhole region and all of its countries, including Serbia.\r\nLet me conclude by highlighting the need for the \r\nUnited Nations to change in order to remain relevant, \r\nlive up to its responsibilities, secure the promise of \r\nsustainable development, ensure human rights and \r\nguarantee peace and security for future generations. \r\nWe are aware that such reform is about what we can and \r\nmust do together in order to better support our common \r\nefforts in transforming lives. The 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development points the way towards a \r\nbetter future, the future we want and the future that our \r\nchildren deserve. We cannot and must not fail to deliver \r\non that promise. Albania stands ready to do its part and \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n20/26 17-29710\r\ncooperate with all those willing to invest in the future \r\nand make our world a better place for all.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister of the Republic of Albania for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Edi Rama, Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nAlbania, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister \r\nof the Republic of Malta\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta.\r\nMr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Malta, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I have \r\ngreat pleasure in welcoming His Excellency Mr. Joseph \r\nMuscat, Prime Minister of the Republic of Malta, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Muscat (Malta): There can be no peace while \r\npoverty, especially extreme poverty, exists. Peace is \r\nnot just about the absence of war or conflict. Rather, \r\nis is about managing and addressing climate change, \r\nmigration and food and water insecurity. The instrument \r\nof the United Nations that weaves sustainable peace \r\ntogether with universal challenges is the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. In that regard, Malta, as \r\nPresident of the Council of the European Union, has \r\nworked hard with its other member States to achieve a \r\nsuccessful march towards a new European consensus \r\non development that encompasses the 2030 Agenda \r\nthrough a resolute plan of action to eradicate poverty.\r\nNever has it been more urgent to work to preserve \r\nthe future of humankind. The 2030 Agenda is the first \r\nstep towards achieving the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). Every sector of society must be on \r\nboard if we are to deliver on such an arduous task. As \r\nthe Commonwealth’s Chair-in-Office, I would like to \r\nhighlight its strong commitment to its role in realizing \r\nthe SDGs. The Commonwealth represents 52 different \r\nrealities, which has led us to launch, in broad terms, \r\na number of common initiatives to accelerate the \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development Goals.\r\nMalta is taking action at the national level. We \r\nhave made a voluntary commitment to designating \r\n30 per cent of all waters under Maltese jurisdiction as \r\nmarine protected areas. As is well known, Malta has \r\nbeen at the forefront of international maritime and \r\nmarine-related issues. Fifty years ago, Malta’s first \r\nPermanent Representative to the United Nations, the \r\nlate Arvid Pardo, made a famous speech that triggered \r\nthe negotiation of the 1982 United Nations Convention \r\non the Law of the Sea (see A/C.1/PV.1515). It is in \r\na similar spirit that we support the valuable work \r\nbeing done to achieve a legally binding international \r\ninstrument under the United Nations Convention on the \r\nLaw of the Sea for the conservation and sustainable use \r\nof marine biological diversity in areas beyond national \r\njurisdiction, which will be crucial to finally bringing \r\nlegal protection to the biodiversity of the high seas. \r\nFor our part, we will continue contributing to the good \r\ngovernance of the oceans by hosting the next Ocean \r\nConference in Malta in October. Furthermore, we fully \r\nsupport the establishment of an intergovernmental \r\npanel on ocean governance that would report to the \r\nGeneral Assembly through the Secretary-General.\r\nI also wish to underline the recent initiative \r\nundertaken by the Commonwealth to develop a “blue \r\ncharter”, which will serve to assist the countries of \r\nthe Commonwealth, most of them small developing \r\nStates, in meeting the requirements outlined in SDG 14. \r\nLikewise, we wholeheartedly welcome the November \r\n2016 entry into force of the Paris Agreement. It is \r\nonly by greening our actions that we can ensure that \r\nsustainable development complements and respects \r\nMother Earth. Malta, together with all of its partners \r\nin the European Union, is strongly committed to the \r\nParis Agreement.\r\nAs a Government, we base our policies on four \r\noverarching principles: social mobility, social justice, \r\nequality and unity. Only today did we learn that, for \r\nanother year in a row, fewer people in Malta are at \r\nrisk of poverty. That follows our Government’s efforts \r\nto distribute the proceeds that come from sustained \r\ngrowth fairly. That is an achievement that is as dear to \r\nus as our record-setting economic growth and minimal \r\nlevels of unemployment. It is exactly what we strive for. \r\nOur raison d’être is what we describe as prosperity with \r\na purpose.\r\nA prosperous future must be accompanied by an \r\ninclusive society. People who live in fear or who are \r\noppressed or discriminated against cannot realize their \r\npotential, and are therefore not at peace. Malta seeks \r\nto lead by example and ensure equality as a hallmark \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 21/26\r\nof our political legacy. We have put human rights, \r\nequality and empowerment at the forefront of our \r\npolitical agenda, particularly on the priority issues of \r\nlesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer \r\nrights and gender equality. We have redefined marriage \r\nto grant full equality and affirm gender neutral access. \r\nAll this has been complemented by amendments to our \r\nconstitution to protect people against discrimination \r\non the basis of sexual orientation and gender identity. \r\nThese individual choices should really have as little \r\nsignificance as the colour of one’s eyes.\r\nThe economic and political empowerment of our \r\ncitizens, regardless of their gender, is a priority for \r\nus. We have been gradually introducing measures to \r\nhelp reconcile work and family responsibilities. We \r\nare proud to be the only European country providing \r\nuniversal free child care to all working parents, an \r\ninitiative that has liberated the potential of so many \r\nwomen in our society. We want to ensure more gender-\r\nbalanced political representation, coupled with recent \r\ninitiatives to increase youth participation by lowering \r\nthe voting age in general and in European elections \r\nfrom 18 to 16 years of age, after having already lowered \r\nit for local elections.\r\nMalta, despite its small size, can now serve as a \r\nbeacon of political courage that inspires others to \r\nintroduce concrete measures and reforms. Everyone \r\nmust feel empowered in today’s society. The protection \r\nof marginalized and vulnerable people is a must if we \r\nare to strive for an inclusive world. The United Nations \r\nis pivotal in all this. It must continue to spearhead, \r\nsustain and mobilize the international community as \r\nwe journey along the ambitious path to 2030.\r\nBut so much more must be done. The exploitation \r\nof human misery knows no boundaries. Migrant \r\nsmuggling and human trafficking by criminal groups \r\nare prevalent all over the world, and Malta has \r\nwitnessed much of that very close to home, along the \r\ncentral Mediterranean routes. As a State member of \r\nthe European Union, Malta is part of a wider European \r\nresponse aimed at tackling human-trafficking networks \r\nin the Mediterranean Sea.\r\nHowever, without a global response, national and \r\neven regional action is insufficient. Malta welcomes \r\nthe progress that has been made in developing a global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration. That \r\nshould reaffirm the sovereign right of States to decide \r\ntheir immigration policies, but it should also commit \r\nthem to building a migration system and institutions \r\nthat operate in a timely manner so that migrants are \r\ntreated fairly and with dignity. It should protect \r\nmigrants’ human rights and create awareness of the \r\nimportance of combating exploitation and modern \r\nslavery. It should lead campaigns against xenophobia \r\nwhile providing support for the integration of long-\r\nterm migrants and taking account of the feelings \r\nof people in host countries. It is also our belief that \r\nalthough the global compact should encompass all \r\nof these measures, it should also facilitate orderly, \r\nsafe and regular migration, while committing States, \r\nparticularly those of origin and transit, to taking action \r\nto reduce illegal and unmanaged f lows.\r\nChallenging times require us to act swiftly to meet \r\nsuch challenges. And that time is now. It is sooner \r\nrather than later. Systematic action by stakeholders at \r\nall levels and across all strata is crucial if its benefits \r\nare to be felt by people in every corner of the world. \r\nThe United Nations is the prime mobilizer and anchor \r\nof international peace, security and stability and has \r\na crucial role to play if we are to secure a peaceful, \r\nsustainable and better world for all. Malta is a firm \r\nbeliever in the overarching power of multilateralism. We \r\ndo not believe that the United Nations is simply a sum \r\nof its parts. Rather, it is a force that grows exponentially \r\nwhen we think and act as one rather than alone.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On behalf \r\nof the General Assembly, I wish to thank the Prime \r\nMinister of the Republic of Malta for the statement he \r\nhas just made.\r\nMr. Joseph Muscat, Prime Minister of the Republic \r\nof Malta, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. José Ulisses Correia e Silva, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Reform of the \r\nRepublic of Cabo Verde\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): The \r\nAssembly will now hear an address by the Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Reform of the Republic of \r\nCabo Verde.\r\nMr. José Ulisses Correia e Silva, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Reform of the Republic of Cabo \r\nVerde, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. José Ulisses Correia e \r\nSilva, Prime Minister and Minister of Reform of the \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n22/26 17-29710\r\nRepublic of Cabo Verde, and inviting him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nMr. Silva (Cabo Verde) (spoke in Portuguese; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): I am very \r\npleased and honoured to be taking part in this meeting \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. I \r\nbring with me the warm greetings of the Cabo Verdean \r\npeople both living in the country and in the diaspora.\r\nI want to assure Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres of the full support of the Government of \r\nCabo Verde, especially in carrying out the reforms \r\nhe has announced aimed at strengthening the broad \r\ndelivery capacity, transparency and accountability of \r\nour Organization.\r\nI salute the President of the Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session, Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, and wish him \r\nevery success. We listened with particular interest to \r\nthe programme he has announced for his presidency, \r\nwhose six points are interlinked and geared to ensuring \r\npeople’s protection, dignity and well-being. Indeed, the \r\ntheme proposed for the seventy-second session could \r\nnot be more appropriate, given the underlying objective \r\nof the President’s programme to bring the United \r\nNations ever closer to the people.\r\nCabo Verde prides itself on being a nation with five \r\nand a half centuries of history, and on having built a \r\ncreole identity of its own at the junction between Africa \r\nand Europe, while also being open to the world, with a \r\nsignificant diaspora in several countries and embodying \r\nthe peaceful coexistence we wish to see in all nations. \r\nAs a small island country that has few natural resources \r\nand no mineral resources at all, we know that we can \r\nonly affirm ourselves in the concert of nations and in \r\nthe global economic system by exemplifying political, \r\ninstitutional and social stability; by displaying \r\ncosmopolitanism, being trustworthy in our relations \r\nwith development partners and investors; by upholding \r\nthe values of democracy, freedom, human dignity \r\nand full citizenship; and by proving the quality of our \r\ninstitutions and the excellence of our human resources. \r\nAlthough intangible, they are our greatest assets and \r\nthe foundation of our development process. Our only \r\noption is to value those assets and to make them \r\ndistinctive and focused on the people who are truly our \r\ndevelopment actors and beneficiaries — the children, \r\nyoung people, women and men of all countries.\r\nI raise these points because I agree that it is \r\nappropriate to focus on people. Women and men in every \r\ncountry need political, institutional, socioeconomic and \r\neducational environments that release their creative \r\nenergy and their capacity to innovate and learn, to \r\nwork, cooperate and trust, to self-organize and to be \r\naccountable. That is possible only in environments of \r\npeace and security that establish a belief in the future \r\nin people, as opposed to simply living one day at a time, \r\nbeset with unease and limited horizons.\r\nThe people and the Government of Cabo Verde \r\nare concerned about the current international context, \r\nwhere not only do old disputes persist but where we \r\nare also seeing new internal political crises, armed \r\nconflicts, terrorist acts and the organized crimes of \r\ntrafficking in drugs, people and weapons and piracy, \r\nas well as other transnational ideological trends, \r\nsuch as populism, racial supremacy, xenophobia and \r\nintolerance of human and cultural diversity.\r\nSuch ills are detrimental to global peace, \r\nbecause they cause human suffering, claim lives and \r\ncontribute to other humanitarian tragedies, such as the \r\nunprecedented increase we are seeing in the numbers \r\nof refugees, as well as in hunger and violence against \r\nwomen and children. They undermine the rule of law, \r\nweaken democracy, threaten the territorial integrity \r\nof States, corrupt the bases of economic and social \r\nprogress and endanger coexistence at both the national \r\nand international levels. These evils, unfortunately, \r\nspare no region in a globalized world.\r\nJust as the threats to security are global, so are \r\nthe challenges. The opportunities for combat ing them \r\neffectively are also global, and permanent representation \r\nfor Africa on the Security Council is therefore fully \r\njustified. The Government of Cabo Verde supports \r\nreform of the Security Council aimed at enabling it to \r\nreflect today’s changing world by integrating permanent \r\nrepresentation for Africa into its broader composition. \r\nIn our view, considering that the positions of both sides \r\nhave already been sufficiently expressed, it is time to \r\nstart negotiations based on a text.\r\nThanks to the United Nations, for the first time \r\nhumankind has a holistic and comprehensive agenda \r\nthat offers a real opportunity for sustainable and \r\ninclusive development, not only because it integrates \r\nthe economic, social and environmental dimensions of \r\nsustainable development, but also because it considers \r\nthe cross-cutting issues of peace, security, justice and \r\nnecessary partnerships and promotes the call to leave \r\nno one behind.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 23/26\r\nNow, two years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, the challenges lie in its \r\nimplementation. The United Nations must therefore \r\nbe able to play a catalytic role in forming consensus \r\nand mobilizing resources to make a difference on the \r\nimplementation, funding and capacity-building fronts. \r\nIn that regard, we commend the Secretary-General’s \r\nongoing exercise aimed at adapting the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system and reforming the Secretariat’s \r\nmanagement structures to meet the challenges of \r\nimplementing the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals.\r\nIn that regard, we should focus particularly on the \r\nsituation of middle-income countries, including small \r\nisland developing States that have graduated to that \r\nstatus, such as Cabo Verde. This category of countries \r\nneeds a common response in terms of new metrics \r\nthat can provide a more systemic assessment of their \r\nfinancial needs and structural vulnerabilities.\r\nFor small island developing States, the swift and \r\nrapid implementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nchange is a priority, as it should be for the whole world.\r\nCabo Verde expresses its solidarity with the \r\nvictims of recent hurricanes. While there have always \r\nbeen hurricanes, the bad news is that with climate \r\nchange they tend to be more frequent, cruel and \r\ndestructive. The consequences are devastating for the \r\nregions and countries that are most vulnerable from \r\nan environmental and economic point of view, such as \r\nsmall island developing States and their regions. Every \r\nnew day is one day too late for vigorous and globalized \r\naction on the factors that trigger and accelerate \r\nclimate change.\r\nFor Cabo Verde, the rule of law and democracy \r\nare not mere options; above all, they are essential \r\nto ensuring objective, transparent and predictable \r\ngovernance, both nationally and internationally. Cabo \r\nVerde’s internal order is aligned with international \r\npositions and practices in the field of human rights \r\nthrough the Constitution of the Republic and its laws, \r\ninstitutions, public policies and social practices. We \r\nrecognize, however, that there have been difficulties \r\nwithin the United Nations in harmonizing positions \r\nregarding the universalization of human rights \r\nprinciples and practices, and that we must pursue that \r\nobjective through dialogue and respect among parties.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to highlight the \r\nSecretary-General’s initiative to establish a pact with \r\nMember States and a circle of leadership on preventing \r\nand responding to sexual exploitation and abuse in all \r\nUnited Nations operations, above all in the context of \r\npeacekeeping and humanitarian action. That initiative \r\nwill give greater dignity to our world’s most vulnerable \r\npeople, especially women and girls, and promote \r\ntheir rights.\r\nAs a supporter of international relations governed \r\nby international law, Cabo Verde actively participates \r\nin codifying such law by joining and taking part \r\nin negotiations and by signing, ratifying and \r\nimplementing most of the international instruments in \r\na broad spectrum of areas. In that context, Cabo Verde \r\nhas already deposited its instrument of ratification of \r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change and signed \r\nthe Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, \r\nconcluded in New York on 7 July.\r\nWe welcome the success of the preparatory work \r\ntowards developing an international legal instrument \r\non the conservation and sustainable use of marine \r\nbiodiversity in areas beyond national jurisdiction. \r\nMoreover, we support the convening of a diplomatic \r\nconference in 2018 to work towards such a convention \r\nissue, which should have safeguards for the specific \r\nsituation of small island developing States.\r\nThe conclusion of the Rome Statute of the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC) was a historic \r\nmoment in the fight against impunity for those \r\nresponsible for the most serious crimes against \r\nhumanity, and I therefore express Cabo Verde’s firm \r\nsupport to the ICC. Strengthening the Court is a duty \r\nthat the present generation owes to future ones.\r\nAs written by a poet and songwriter, and later \r\nsung by the diva Cesária Évora, Cabo Verde is “ten \r\nlittle grains of sand” in the middle of the Atlantic. \r\nDespite our small size, we want to make Cabo Verde \r\na country with relevance in the Middle Atlantic in \r\nterms of economic stature, security and diplomacy for \r\npeace and the promotion of freedom and democracy. \r\nWe intend to position Cabo Verde as a transit hub in \r\nthe Middle Atlantic for tourism, air transport, port \r\noperations, financial and investment operations, \r\nbusiness localization and development in the digital \r\nand nano-technological economy, and in the attraction \r\nof investment and skills from the diaspora.\r\nCabo Verde promotes collective and cooperative \r\nsecurity systems, as necessitated by the transnational \r\nnature of crime and its location. We are seeking to \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n24/26 17-29710\r\nposition ourselves as a useful interlocutor in the concert \r\nof nations for dialogue, peace and tolerance. Its history \r\nand location have transformed Cabo Verde into a \r\ncountry born of mergers between Europe and Africa, a \r\ncountry that maintains good relations with all nations \r\nof the world. We would like to value and develop those \r\nassets strategically. That is our vision and purpose for \r\nour economy, security and diplomacy. It is embodied in \r\nour strategic plan for sustainable development, which \r\nhas already been completed and is aligned with the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. Partnerships are an \r\nintegral and indispensable part of the 2030 Agenda, and \r\nnational ownership will find in them an unquestionable \r\ncomplement so that our strategic plan for sustainable \r\ndevelopment can succeed, with the United Nations at \r\nthe forefront.\r\nHappiness is the ultimate right to which the people \r\nof the world aspire. The 2030 Agenda has given the \r\nworld not only a vision but also a road map for bringing \r\nhappiness to people and leaving no one behind on the \r\npath to sustainable development. In 1945, the peoples \r\nof the United Nations showed their determination to \r\nconduct humankind down a path that would not lead to \r\nwar. Today, with the 2030 Agenda, they will be able to \r\ndetermine another course for humankind and for people \r\nwho struggle with poverty and a lack of development \r\nalternatives.\r\nIt is up to us — we, the peoples of the United \r\nNations — to support both the Secretary-General and \r\nthe President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session in this honourable and great task of \r\nadvancing the happiness agenda.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): On \r\nbehalf of the General Assembly, I wish to thank the \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Reform of the Republic \r\nof Cabo Verde for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. José Ulisses Correia e Silva, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Reform of the Republic of Cabo \r\nVerde, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Spanish): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Pham Binh Minh, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister of Viet Nam.\r\nMr. Pham Binh Minh (Viet Nam): I extend \r\nmy warmest congratulations to His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session.\r\nMy special thanks also go to the Secretary-General \r\nand the Secretariat. Only 10 months into his term of \r\noffice, Mr. Guterres has already left his mark on the \r\nOrganization’s work for peace, development and \r\nhuman rights.\r\nOn 20 September 1977, exactly 40 years ago, Viet \r\nNam was admitted to the United Nations as its 149th \r\nMember. One day later, the then Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Foreign Minister of Viet Nam stood right here \r\nat this rostrum and addressed the General Assembly \r\n(see A/32/PV.1). Representing a nation devastated \r\nby decades of war, he affirmed a unified Viet Nam’s \r\npledge to cooperate closely with other Member States \r\nin striving tirelessly to turn the lofty goals of the United \r\nNations into reality. Those goals are peace, national \r\nindependence, democracy and social progress.\r\nThose 40 years have been an era of transformation \r\nfor my country. Today, Viet Nam is a dynamic economy \r\non a path to reform and sustainable development. We \r\nhave transformed ourselves from being aid-dependent \r\nto a lower middle-income country. Our efforts to \r\nimplement the Millennium Development Goals have \r\nhelped to bring millions of Vietnamese out of poverty.\r\nBut one thing has not changed. Viet Nam today \r\nis as committed as ever to the United Nations. We are \r\na staunch supporter and proponent of multilateralism \r\nwith the United Nations at its core. We believe in the \r\nfundamental role of international law and the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and the principles of respect \r\nfor sovereignty, political independence and territorial \r\nintegrity, non-interference, of refraining from the \r\nthreat or use of force and of working for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\nWe are gathered here as the world is undergoing \r\nprofound and fast transformations. The fourth \r\nindustrial revolution, particularly the advance of digital \r\ntechnology, is creating unprecedented opportunities \r\nfor development for all. Enormous efforts to realize \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development are \r\nunder way, and yet our world is still fraught with \r\nturmoil, uncertainties and fragility. While peace \r\nand cooperation prevail, people around the world are \r\nfacing unprecedented challenges to their security \r\nand development. Political  instability and the risk of \r\nconflicts, disasters and climate change threaten the \r\nsustainable development of all nations.\r\nTerrorism and weapons of mass destruction \r\nhave gone global and are a threat to everyone. \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.15\r\n17-29710 25/26\r\nEfforts to achieve disarmament, arms control and \r\nnon-proliferation have not progressed as expected. \r\nThe worst migration and humanitarian crisis since \r\nthe Second World War continues to unfold. For \r\nmany decades, the desire to be able to live in peace \r\nhas remained a distant dream for millions of people. \r\nTogether, with the slow and unsustainable growth of the \r\nglobal economy, globalization and economic integration \r\nare now facing a less certain future. Inequality within \r\nand between countries remains one of the biggest \r\nchallenges of our time. The impact of climate change is \r\never more real and far beyond what has been predicted. \r\nThis year, we have witnessed multiple natural disasters \r\nthat have inflicted heavy losses in human life and \r\nproperty in Cuba, Mexico, the United States and other \r\nCaribbean countries.\r\nGiven those daunting challenges, the theme chosen \r\nfor this session, “Focusing on people: Striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet” \r\ncould not have been more timely. With the adoption \r\nof the 2030 Agenda, the international community \r\nhas clearly chosen sustainable development as the \r\npath towards a better destiny for current and future \r\ngenerations. It is now incumbent on us to make that \r\nambitious plan a reality. Developing countries should \r\nbe allowed more favourable conditions and resources \r\nto realize the Sustainable Development Goals. We call \r\non developed nations to fulfil their commitments on \r\nproviding financial assistance and technology transfer \r\nfor developing countries.\r\nOn the path to sustainable development, we must \r\nplace the interests of the people at the centre of all \r\nour policies and actions. If we do not, we will not be \r\nable to ensure a decent life for all. I do not believe that \r\nlife can be decent when poverty, unemployment and \r\nepidemics are still not effectively addressed. It cannot \r\nbe decent if it is still threatened by climate change \r\nand disasters. Above all, we will not succeed in our \r\nquest for sustainable development and a decent life for \r\nall if we cannot secure sustainable peace.\r\nHaving enjoyed peace and independence for the \r\npast four decades, we now know what peace can bring \r\nabout. Sustaining peace must always be at the top of \r\nour agenda. That major undertaking will take strong \r\ncommitment and cooperation. I believe we will need to \r\ncome together to strengthen multilateralism to achieve \r\nthose goals.\r\nFor today’s global challenges, multilateralism has \r\nbeen shown to provide the most effective solutions. \r\nMultilateral institutions are venues in which countries \r\ncan align their various interests, manage disputes and \r\ndifferences, and promote cooperation. However, trust \r\nin multilateralism will falter if those institutions fail to \r\nprove their effectiveness or lack consensus on common \r\ngoals and principles. Global and regional multilateral \r\nmechanisms should therefore function in a transparent, \r\neffective and responsive manner.\r\nThe United Nations must be at the centre of \r\ncoordination and joint efforts to address global \r\nchallenges, building an ever more comprehensive \r\nsystem of rules and norms with a mechanism for \r\nensuring objectiveness, fairness and equality. To do \r\nthat, the United Nations must undertake comprehensive \r\nreforms, from its organizational structure and working \r\nmethodologies to the way that development resources \r\nare mobilized and allocated. Viet Nam supports efforts \r\nto reform the United Nations in that regard and will \r\nparticipate responsibly in the process.\r\nInternational law is an essential foundation of order \r\nand stability in international relations. Wars, conflicts \r\nand tension occur today mainly because international \r\nlaw is not fully respected or observed in good faith. We \r\nbelieve that by upholding international law, peace can be \r\nsecured. We should take concrete action, in accordance \r\nwith international law and the Charter of the United \r\nNations, to prevent conflicts, build confidence and \r\npeacefully settle disputes, including in the Middle East \r\nand Africa, and we call for the denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula. In that regard, we also find that the \r\nunilateral embargo on Cuba is inappropriate and call \r\nfor its immediate removal.\r\nWe welcome the recent adoption of the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons, a historic milestone \r\non the road to a world free of nuclear weapons. I am \r\nsigning the Treaty today, and call on others to sign \r\nand ratify it so as to enable its entry into force as \r\nsoon as possible. Let us all be clear — the danger of \r\nnuclear weapons will loom over humankind as long as \r\nthey continue to exist.\r\nThis year also marks the fiftieth anniversary of \r\nthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), \r\nof which Viet Nam is proud to be a member. ASEAN \r\nis striving to build a rules-based and people-oriented \r\ncommunity to strengthen its centrality in the evolving \r\nregional architecture and actively contribute to peace, \r\nA/72/PV.15 22/09/2017\r\n26/26 17-29710\r\nstability and prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region. Viet \r\nNam is working closely with other ASEAN members to \r\naddress common challenges.\r\nWith regard to the South China Sea dispute, Viet \r\nNam and ASEAN call on all the parties concerned to \r\nexercise self-restraint and settle disputes by peaceful \r\nmeans, in accordance with international law, including \r\nthe 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of \r\nthe Sea. They must fully respect diplomatic and legal \r\nprocesses, implement the Declaration on the Conduct \r\nof Parties in the South China Sea and expedite the \r\ncompletion of an effective and legally binding code \r\nof conduct.\r\nViet Nam also took pride in hosting the Asia-Pacific \r\nEconomic Cooperation Forum this year, as we seek to \r\nbuild an Asia-Pacific partnership for sustainable and \r\ninclusive development in the twenty-first century.\r\nAt the global level, Viet Nam has actively engaged \r\nin the work of the United Nations, serving on the Human \r\nRights Council from 2014 to 2016 and as a member of \r\nthe Economic and Social Council for the term 2016-\r\n2018. We have begun to implement our national plan \r\nof action for implementing the 2030 Agenda and the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change. We will present \r\nour voluntary national review on the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda in 2018. In March, Viet Nam hosted \r\na high-level Euro-Asia regional meeting on improving \r\ncooperation on transit and trade facilitation.\r\nSince 2014, Viet Nam has sent its officers to work \r\nin United Nations peacekeeping missions in Africa \r\nand is preparing for the deployment of level-two field \r\nhospitals. Before that, in 2009, Viet Nam presented \r\nits candidature for non-permanent membership of the \r\nSecurity Council for the term 2020-2021. We believe \r\nthat those are the most practical ways we can contribute \r\nto the cause of sustainable peace and security.\r\nI am confident that through our concerted effort \r\nand the strength of multilateralism, we will fulfil our \r\nmission to maintain peace and security and secure a \r\ndecent life and a sustainable future for all.\r\nThe meeting rose at noon.\r\n"
