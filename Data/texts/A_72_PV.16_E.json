"United Nations A/72/PV.16\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n16th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 22 September 2017, 12 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Sauer (Finland), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at noon.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Allen Michael Chastanet, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Finance, \r\nEconomic Growth, Job Creation, External \r\nAffairs and the Public Service of Saint Lucia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Finance, Economic Growth, Job Creation, External \r\nAffairs and the Public Service of Saint Lucia.\r\nMr. Allen Michael Chastanet, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Finance, Economic Growth, Job \r\nCreation, External Affairs and the Public Service \r\nof Saint Lucia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure \r\nin welcoming His Excellency Mr. Allen Michael \r\nChastanet, Prime Minister and Minister for Finance, \r\nEconomic Growth, Job Creation, External Affairs and \r\nthe Public Service of Saint Lucia, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Chastanet (Saint Lucia): Saint Lucia \r\ncongratulates Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his assumption of \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session and assures him of the full support and \r\ncooperation of our delegation during his tenure.\r\nWe thank his predecessor, His Excellency \r\nAmbassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his able \r\nstewardship of the Assembly during the past year.\r\nFor small island States like my own in the \r\nCaribbean region, the promise of the United Nations \r\nis being tested today more than ever. The world is \r\nexperiencing extraordinary changes at a breathtaking \r\npace — changes that are reshaping the way we live, the \r\nway we work, our planet and the very nature of peace \r\nand security.\r\nI arrived in New York earlier this week after a \r\ntour of the devastation wrought by Hurricane Irma on \r\nislands in the Caribbean, and for the entire week I have \r\nbeen engaged in discussions focused on the region’s \r\nrecovery efforts. I have also watched, from afar and with \r\na heavy heart, further destruction to my region — with \r\nHurricane Maria’s crushing blow to the sister islands \r\nof Dominica and Puerto Rico, claiming many lives and \r\nsaddling those islands with hundreds of millions — if \r\nnot billions — in damage. \r\nI have also listened in dismay to the silence of \r\nmany, and the weak acknowledgement by others, \r\nregarding the crisis in our region. It has awakened in \r\nme the fear that we may be on our own to chart a path \r\nforward for our region. While some continue to doubt \r\nand deny the assessments of science, it is impossible to \r\navoid the facts of climate change. In less than a month \r\nDominica, Antigua and Barbuda, the Bahamas, Cuba, \r\nthe British Virgin Islands, Anguilla, the Dominican \r\nRepublic, Saint Bart, Saint John, Saint Thomas, the \r\nTurks and Caicos, Sint Maarten, and Saint Martin have \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

I can also \r\nadd Florida and Texas. The impact has been without \r\ndiscrimination. \r\nLet us acknowledge the fact that small island \r\ndeveloping States have repeatedly warned the \r\ninternational community that a failure to respond \r\nadequately to climate change would betray our children \r\nand condemn future generations to certain doom. I dare \r\nsay that we do not have the luxury to be silent on that \r\nfront anymore. We must act now. The effect of natural \r\ndisasters does not have a diplomatic solution. What is \r\nneeded is tangible action. The future is now, and the \r\nchallenges are profound. What is fast becoming the new \r\nnormal is the intensification of extreme weather events, \r\nwhich demands from us real solutions in real time. No \r\nlonger can we depend on the old mechanisms with their \r\ndense bureaucracies that delay or limit a nation’s ability \r\nto safeguard its citizens during a crisis and slow the \r\nrebuilding effort.\r\nI remind all here that Saint Lucia, along with most \r\nof our sister States of the Caribbean Community, is \r\nanchored at the heart of hurricane alley, with our people \r\non the front line, and all too often we are the first to \r\nendure the ravages of Mother Nature’s fury when the \r\nstorms come off the Atlantic Ocean. Today, as we \r\nlook to the world for leadership and partnership, we \r\nthank France, China and Germany for their continued \r\nleadership on climate-change issues. The Government \r\nand the people of Saint Lucia offer their most sincere \r\ncondolences and whatever support that we can to those \r\nin need. \r\nThe ties that bind our peoples run deep; the pain of \r\none is the pain of all. We ask that the global community \r\nfollow that ethos. We never forget that we are one global \r\necosystem that demands that we all be our brother’s \r\nkeeper. Our Nobel Laureate, Sir Derek Walcott, has \r\nspoken to the sense of responsibility to one’s neighbour \r\nthat is rooted in our cultural DNA and the imperative \r\nof helping, not out of a sense of duty but out of a sense \r\nof community. That was exemplified by Mr. Orlando \r\nSmith, the Premier of the British Virgin Islands, as \r\nDominica faced the imminent threat of Hurricane \r\nMaria. Mr. Smith, whose own island had already been \r\nbrutalized by Hurricane Irma, offered his unwavering \r\nsupport to the Prime Minister of Dominica, Mr. Skerrit. \r\nEven in our destitution, we in the Caribbean open our \r\nhearts and our means to those in need.\r\nI pause here to share our condolences to others in \r\nour hemisphere, notably Mexico, which has long been \r\nof support to us, but now faces a mounting death toll \r\nfrom the earthquakes that have struck that country.\r\nI stand here and ask that we revisit many of our \r\nlofty goals, as we see the lack of equity that is at the \r\nheart of all of our discussions and seek to address it. \r\nMultilateral discussions on development, resilience and \r\nthe sustainable development of our countries should \r\nbe grounded in what is equitable and just. We must \r\nacknowledge that the United Nations will never succeed \r\nwhen only a few prosper and many, whose number is \r\ngrowing, do not. How can we, when the progress we \r\nmake is fragile and unequal? How can we, when we \r\nindulge our differences to the exclusion of the work we \r\nmust do together? How can we, when inequity remains \r\nthe driving force of our international system, propelling \r\nsome forward and leaving far too many behind? How \r\ncan we, as leaders, talk about sustainable development \r\ngoals, when the people of our countries continue to \r\nstruggle just to survive?\r\nFundamentally, our global reality is an increasingly \r\nintegrated one. No one is spared the perils of the \r\nconvulsions in our world. Our economies, natural \r\nenvironment and people are all connected. We in this \r\nhemisphere are not impervious to the impact of the wars \r\nand the starvation that are taking place in the Middle \r\nEast and Africa, the persecution that is taking place in \r\nAsia and the rise of nationalistic tendencies taking place \r\nin Europe. We are stacked in a global row of dominoes, \r\nwhere a disruptive event in one country begets similar \r\nor worse events in neighbouring countries. It spreads, \r\nimpacting us all and testing our social, political and \r\neconomic systems.\r\nWe live in a world of imperfect choices — choices \r\nbetween clinging to the old systems that do not serve us \r\nany longer and rethinking new ways to secure a better \r\nfuture. We must not turn away from the hard choices. \r\nWe must not fear change. Our challenges are real, \r\nserious and numerous. We, the United Nations, must \r\nget better at the policies that strike at the root of the \r\nproblem and ground our 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) in one word: equity.\r\nI must repeat a point stated earlier. In a time when \r\ninequity pervades every aspect of our international order, \r\nwhat hope do we have of successfully implementing the \r\nSDGs when the deck is stacked against many of our \r\npeople? How do we ensure that all citizens have their \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 3/28\r\nmost basic needs satisfied, such as food on their plate, \r\nwhen we struggle from crisis to crisis? We must agree \r\nthat there should be a minimum standard of living for \r\neach and every one of our citizens. We must maintain \r\nbasic standards that provide adequate health care, \r\neducation, housing, security and economic opportunity \r\nfor every citizen of our countries. Without establishing \r\nsuch standards, we cannot engage in any meaningful \r\ndiscussion or plan of action.\r\nThat is what will stem the f low of migration. It \r\nwill offer opportunities to be productive members of \r\nsociety. It will dull the urge that drives some to crime \r\nand others into the arms of groups that foment evil. \r\nAny overhaul of the United Nations system must be \r\nfounded on the principle of equity. Without equity as a \r\nfoundation, Sustainable Development Goals are dreams \r\nthat go away when we open our eyes to the constant \r\nstate of crisis confronting us.\r\nI take this moment to assure the Secretary-General \r\nof my country’s support for the effort needed to reform \r\nthe Organization in order to address the new era and \r\nits responsibilities. At the heart of any reform of such a \r\nnature, we, nations both large and small, must play our \r\nrole in protecting the rights of individuals everywhere. \r\nIn the face of mounting challenges, we must seek the \r\ncourage and wisdom to act boldly and collectively and \r\nrevise outmoded programmes that are so glaringly \r\ninadequate for the needs of our time.\r\nWe have to harness new ideas and technologies \r\nand invest in the individuals and the generations who \r\nwill build our future. We must see more in terms of \r\noutcomes and less in terms of bureaucracy. We must \r\ncome here to make a difference and be able to return to \r\nour homes ready to deliver on the promises that we have \r\nmade. The mobilization of the leadership of the world \r\nto come here will be all for naught if we do not deliver. \r\nWe must come here to make a difference and not get \r\ncarried away by name-calling. Rather, we must ground \r\nour discourse in mutual respect and a commitment to \r\ndeliver to those we lead.\r\nWe must understand and acknowledge that when \r\ntimes change, so must we. Our claims to fidelity to \r\nthe words of the Charter of the United Nations mean \r\nnothing if we do not create new responses to old and \r\nnew challenges. We must be a source of hope for the \r\npoor, the sick and the marginalized so that we can \r\nensure peace and a decent life for all our citizens on \r\na sustainable planet. That requires that we constantly \r\nadvance the principles of the Charter. The commitments \r\nthat we make to each other must be honoured, which \r\nwill, in turn, strengthen our mutual trust.\r\nWithin and beyond the Organization, we must look \r\nmore honestly at how we categorize each other and \r\nhow the development and donor community rank us. \r\nHow can we call a country a middle-income country, \r\nbased solely on its gross domestic product per capita, \r\nwhen we know that its location renders it vulnerable to \r\nnatural disasters that have the capacity to bring it and \r\nits people to their knees?\r\nIt is unconscionable to see our peers forced to \r\nbeg and plead for goodwill and to have to depend on \r\ncommercial loan rates to rebuild broken economies, all \r\nbecause the traditional system is so unyielding, archaic \r\nand sometimes heartless in its design. That model \r\nmust change to one that affords small and developing \r\nnations the real opportunity to survive and thrive in an \r\nincreasingly cold global environment. The model has \r\nto change in order to afford all of us the opportunity \r\nto build back the infrastructure that can secure our \r\nfutures and those of our people and have it be stronger \r\nand more resilient.\r\nIn closing, the people of my region are resilient. \r\nWe are a people and a region committed to working \r\ntogether in order to rebuild stronger and better. In \r\nchallenging times, we do not hesitate to commit our \r\nscarce resources to one another. We truly are our \r\nbrothers’ keepers.\r\nWe have also been very fortunate to receive \r\nsupport from friends near and far as we seek to make \r\na better world for those who will follow us. In our \r\ncase, friendships like those that we have with Taiwan, \r\nCuba and Mexico, among others, allow us to envision \r\na positive future. I ask that, while we may come from \r\ndifferent places and with different priorities, we must \r\nnever forget that we share a common future — a \r\nfuture that will be secure only if we meet the threats, \r\nchallenges and opportunities that confront us together, \r\nwith greater cooperation and understanding.\r\nOur generation’s task is to engage in a common \r\neffort towards a common purpose as we answer the call \r\nof our times. Let it be said by our children’s children \r\nthat we were tested and that we did not fail, but rather \r\nthat we delivered to future generations a better world. \r\nWe have that obligation to our people and to our world.\r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n4/28 17-29716\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance, Economic Growth, Job Creation, \r\nExternal Affairs and the Public Service of Saint Lucia \r\nfor the statement he has just made. \r\nMr. Allen Michael Chastanet, Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Finance, Economic Growth, Job \r\nCreation, External Affairs and the Public Service \r\nof Saint Lucia, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Bruno Eduardo Rodríguez Parrilla, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Republic of Cuba.\r\nMr. Rodríguez Parrilla (Cuba) (spoke in Spanish): \r\nAllow me to reiterate to the Secretary-General Cuba’s \r\nsupport for his work at the helm of the United Nations \r\nand as a guarantor and advocate of international peace.\r\nI would like to express my deep condolences to the \r\nrelatives of the deceased and the victims of hurricanes \r\nIrma and Maria, as well as our readiness to increase our \r\ncooperation, to the extent of our modest possibilities, \r\nwith the brother peoples and the Governments of \r\nDominica and Antigua and Barbuda, which are small \r\nCaribbean islands that suffered terrible devastation, \r\nalong with the Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, \r\nSaint Martin, Sint Maarten, the Virgin Islands and \r\nAnguilla. I call upon the international community to \r\ngive the highest priority to the situation and to mobilize \r\nresources to assist the small Caribbean island States \r\nand territories that have suffered such devastation. \r\n We would like to convey Cuba’s warmest feelings \r\nof solidarity to the people and the Government of \r\nMexico, particularly the victims and their relatives \r\nwho were affected by earthquakes, and we reiterate \r\nour readiness to assist their people and support their \r\nrecovery efforts with our modest efforts.\r\nWe also want to express our sorrow to the people of \r\nthe United States, as well as our heartfelt condolences \r\nto the relatives of the deceased and to all victims of \r\nHurricane Irma.\r\nI speak on behalf of the people of Cuba, who are \r\ncurrently carrying out a colossal effort to recover from \r\nthe severe damage caused to housing, agriculture, \r\nthe power system and other services by Hurricane \r\nIrma. Despite the all-encompassing preventive \r\nmeasures — including the evacuation of more than \r\n1.7 million people — and the full cooperation of all \r\ncitizens, we suffered the loss of 10 people.\r\nThe grave damage to services, the loss of social and \r\npersonal goods, and the hardships endured by families \r\nthat spent many hours without electricity and/or water \r\nonly strengthened the unity and solidarity of our noble \r\nand heroic people. The moving scenes of rescuers \r\nsaving a girl and returning her to her mother, a little \r\nboy picking up a bust of José Martí from the rubble, \r\nstudents helping families they had never met before, \r\nsoldiers from the Armed Forces and the Ministry of \r\nthe Interior doing the toughest jobs, and local leaders \r\nheading the most difficult tasks have become all too \r\nfamiliar.\r\nDuring a visit to the area that suffered the most \r\nsevere devastation, President Raúl Castro issued an \r\nappeal that read: \r\n“These have been difficult days for our people, \r\nwho, in just a few hours, have seen how what was \r\nbuilt with great effort could be destroyed by a \r\ndevastating hurricane. The images received during \r\nthe past few hours are powerful, as is the spirit of \r\nresilience and victory of our people, who come \r\nback fighting in the face of every adversity.”\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nCuba, l sincerely appreciate the genuine expressions \r\nof solidarity and affection expressed by numerous \r\nGovernments, parliaments, international organizations \r\nand representatives of civil society. I would like to \r\nconvey my profound gratitude for the numerous offers \r\nof assistance that we have received.\r\nI still have vivid and emotional memories \r\nof the imposing presence of Fidel Castro Ruz, \r\nCommander-in-Chief of the Cuban Revolution, and the \r\ngreat validity of the ideas he expressed to the General \r\nAssembly. On behalf of our people and Government, I \r\nwould like to express our gratitude for the expressions \r\nof respect, affection and admiration that we have \r\nreceived from so many.\r\nLast Tuesday, President Donald Trump came here to \r\nconvince us that he proposes to promote the prosperity \r\nof nations and persons. But in the real world the wealth \r\npossessed by eight men together is equivalent to the \r\nwealth shared by the 3.6 billion human beings who make \r\nup the poorest half of humanity. In terms of turnover, 69 \r\nof the 100 biggest entities in the world are transnational \r\ncompanies, not States. The turnover of the world’s 10 \r\nbiggest corporations is higher than the public revenues \r\nearned by 180 countries combined. Seven hundred \r\nmillion people live in extreme poverty, and 21 million \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 5/28\r\nare victims of forced labour. In 2015, 5.9 million \r\nchildren died of preventable or curable diseases before \r\nreaching the age of 5. A total of 758 million adults are \r\nstill illiterate.\r\nEight hundred and fifteen million people suffer \r\nfrom chronic hunger — tens of millions more than \r\nin 2015. Two billion are undernourished. Even if the \r\nprecarious decreasing growth rate of recent years \r\nrebounds, 653 million persons will continue to face \r\nhunger by the year 2030. Given current trends, we will \r\nnot be able to eradicate hunger by the year 2050.\r\nThere are 22.5 million refugees. Humanitarian \r\ntragedies associated with migrant f lows are \r\nworsening and increasing amid the clearly unjust \r\ncurrent international economic and political order. \r\nThe construction of walls and barriers, as well as the \r\nlaws and measures adopted to prevent the waves of \r\nrefugees and migrants, have proved to be cruel and \r\nineffective. There is a proliferation of exclusive and \r\nxenophobic policies that violate the human rights of \r\nmillions of people and fail to solve the problems of \r\nunderdevelopment, poverty and armed conflicts — the \r\nmain causes of migration and refugee claims.\r\nMilitary expenditures have increased to $1.7 trillion. \r\nThat reality contradicts those who claim that there are \r\nnot enough resources to eradicate poverty. Despite \r\nall the rhetoric, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment lacks the means for its implementation, \r\nowing to the egoism and lack of political will of the \r\nUnited States and other industrialized countries.\r\nWhat is the miraculous solution that President \r\nDonald Trump recommends to us in the absence of \r\nthe financial f lows of the Marshall Plan? Who will \r\ncontribute the resources for that? How can that be \r\nreconciled with the “America First” idea advanced by \r\nPresident Reagan decades ago and by Trump today? \r\nThe President of the United States ignores and distorts \r\nhistory and believes that a chimera is a goal to be \r\npursued. The production and consumption patterns of \r\ncapitalism are unsustainable and irrational and will \r\ninexorably lead to the destruction of the environment \r\nand the end of the human species.\r\nCan anyone forget about the consequences of \r\ncolonialism, slavery, neocolonialism and imperialism? \r\nCould the several decades of bloody military \r\ndictatorships in Latin America be referred to as an \r\nexample of successful capitalism? Does anyone know \r\nof any form of neoliberal capitalism that has benefited \r\nus all, as opposed to that which destroyed the Latin \r\nAmerican economies in the 1980s?\r\nIt is urgent and essential for the United Nations \r\nto work to establish a new participatory, democratic, \r\nequitable and inclusive international economic order, \r\nas well as a new financial architecture. They must take \r\ninto account the needs and particularities of developing \r\ncountries and the asymmetries that exist in world trade \r\nand finance as a result of centuries of exploitation and \r\nplundering. Industrialized countries have the moral \r\nobligation, the historical responsibility and sufficient \r\nfinancial and technological means to do that. \r\nHowever, not even the rich will be able to enjoy \r\nthe forecast prosperity if climate change is not stopped. \r\nCuba regrets the decision taken by the Government of the \r\nUnited States, which has historically been the principal \r\ngreenhouse-gas-emitting country on the planet, to \r\nwithdraw that country from the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. In 2016, and for the third consecutive \r\nyear, the records for the average global temperature \r\nincrease have been broken, which confirms that climate \r\nchange is a threat to the survival of humankind and the \r\nsustainable development of our peoples. We reiterate \r\nour solidarity with the small island developing States, \r\nespecially those in the Caribbean and the Pacific, which \r\nare the most affected by climate change and for whom \r\nwe request just, special and differentiated treatment. \r\nWe also support the priority attention accorded to the \r\nneeds of sub-Saharan Africa.\r\nThe United States Government has come here \r\nto tell us that, in addition to prosperity, the other \r\ntwo “beautiful pillars” of the international order are \r\nsovereignty and security. We all share the common \r\nresponsibility of preserving the existence of human \r\nbeings in the face of nuclear weapons. An important \r\ncontribution to the achievement of that goal was the \r\nhistoric adoption and signing, under the auspices of the \r\nAssembly, of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, which bans the existence, use and threat \r\nof use of such weapons, which have the capacity to \r\nannihilate the human species. \r\nThe United States has strongly opposed that \r\ntreaty. It announced that it will invest $700 billion \r\nin military expenditures, and it is developing an \r\nextremely aggressive nuclear and military doctrine, \r\nbased on the threat of the use of force and the use of \r\nforce. NATO member States have violated international \r\npeace and security and international law by promoting \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n6/28 17-29716\r\nmilitary interventions and unconventional wars against \r\nsovereign States. As the Commander-in-Chief of the \r\nCuban Revolution, Fidel Castro Ruz, pointed out: \r\n“When this philosophy of despoilment disappears, \r\nthe philosophy of war will have disappeared” \r\n(A/PV.872, para. 188). \r\nThe unlawful imposition of unilateral coercive \r\nmeasures and the use of financial, judicial, cultural \r\nand communication tools to destabilize Governments \r\nand deny peoples their right to self-determination have \r\nbecome commonplace. I believe that the militarization \r\nand the covert use of information and communication \r\ntechnologies to attack other States have increased, \r\nwhile several developed countries strongly oppose the \r\nadoption of international treaties that would regulate \r\ncooperation aimed at securing a safe cyberspace.\r\nThe President of the United States manipulates the \r\nconcepts of sovereignty and security to his exclusive \r\nbenefit and to the detriment of all others, including his \r\nallies. The attempt to resort to military threat and force \r\nin order to stop the irreversible global trend towards \r\nmultipolarization and polycentrism will seriously \r\njeopardize international peace and security, which \r\nshould be defended and preserved through international \r\nefforts. The principles of sovereign equality, respect for \r\nthe territorial integrity of States and non-interference in \r\ntheir internal affairs should be respected. The Charter \r\nof the United Nations and international law do not allow \r\nfor reinterpretation.\r\nUnited Nations reform should pursue the principal \r\ngoal of responding to the pressing needs of people \r\nand the great disadvantaged majority. Multilateralism \r\nshould be protected and reinforced so as to resist the \r\nimperial interests of domination and hegemony. The \r\ndemocratization of the Security Council, both in \r\nterms of its composition and its working methods, is a \r\nmost urgent task. It is also essential to strengthen the \r\nGeneral Assembly and recover the functions that have \r\nbeen usurped.\r\nPatriotism, which was invoked in the statement of \r\nthe United States, is a perversion of humanism and of \r\nlove and loyalty to the homeland and the enrichment and \r\ndefence of national and universal culture. It embodies \r\nan exceptionalist and supremacist vision of ignorant \r\nintolerance in the face of diverse political, economic, \r\nsocial and cultural models.\r\nIn developed countries, the loss of the legitimacy \r\nof political systems and parties has worsened, and voter \r\nabstention is on the rise. Legal and illegal corruption is \r\nspreading. There is the extreme case of the so-called \r\nspecial interests, or corporate payments, in exchange \r\nfor benefits, in the country that spends the highest \r\namount of money in electoral campaigns and where, \r\nparadoxically, a candidate with the lowest number of \r\npopular votes can be elected or be entitled to govern \r\nwith the negligible support of voters. \r\nThere has been an increasing and unheard-of use of \r\nscience and technology to exercise hegemony, mutilate \r\nnational cultures and manipulate human behaviour, \r\nas in the case of so-called big data, or psychometry, \r\nused for political and advertising purposes. Seven \r\nWestern consortiums keep strict control over what is \r\nbeing read, seen or heard on the planet. Technologies \r\nare being monopolized. The governance of digital \r\nnetworks is dictatorial and discriminatory, and despite \r\nappearances the digital divide between rich and poor \r\ncountries is increasing. Opportunities and the rights of \r\nyouth, migrants and workers are being curtailed, and \r\ntheir human rights are being openly and systematically \r\nviolated.\r\nThe day before yesterday, the United States \r\nVice-President, Michael Pence, ridiculously ignorant \r\nof the functions of the Security Council and attempting \r\nto establish new prerogatives, said that the Security \r\nCouncil should modify the composition and methods of \r\nthe Human Rights Council, which “does not deserve its \r\nname” because “a clear majority of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil’s members fail to meet even the most basic \r\nhuman rights standards”. \r\nI assume that Mr. Pence is not including his own \r\ncountry in that category, which in fact deserves to \r\nbe included because of its pattern of the systematic \r\nviolations of human rights, such as the use of torture, \r\narbitrary detentions and imprisonment, as occurs in the \r\nGuantanamo naval base, the assassination of African \r\nAmericans by law-enforcement agents, the killing \r\nof innocent civilians by its troops, xenophobia and \r\nrepression against immigrants, including minors, and \r\nits limited compliance with international instruments.\r\nWe reaffirm our strongest condemnation of all \r\nforms and manifestations of terrorism, and we reject \r\nthe application of double standards in combating them.\r\nThe urgent quest for a just and lasting solution to \r\nthe conflict in the Middle East is based on the exercise \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 7/28\r\nof the inalienable right of the Palestinian people to \r\nself-determination and to the existence of a free and \r\nindependent State within the pre-1967 borders, with \r\nEast Jerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe situation in the Western Sahara requires an \r\neffort, in accordance with United Nations resolutions, \r\nto ensure the Saharan people’s ability to exercise self-\r\ndetermination and to ensure respect for their legitimate \r\nright to live in peace in their own territory.\r\nCuba reaffirms its support for the quest for a \r\npeaceful and negotiated solution to the war in Syria, \r\nwithout any foreign interference and with full respect \r\nfor its sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nThreats to international peace and security \r\nstemming from the expansion of NATO’s presence \r\nalong the borders of Russia are on the rise. We continue \r\nto reject the unilateral and unjust sanctions imposed \r\nagainst that country.\r\nWe demand respect for the so-called nuclear \r\nagreement signed with the Islamic Republic of Iran. \r\nWe reject the threat to totally destroy the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, home to 25 million human \r\nbeings. War is not an option on the Korean peninsula; \r\nit would threaten the existence of hundreds of millions \r\nof people in that area and in neighbouring countries, \r\nand it would lead to a nuclear conflagration of \r\nunpredictable consequences. Only through dialogue \r\nand negotiations will it be possible to achieve a lasting \r\npolitical solution, which should take into account the \r\nlegitimate concerns of all parties involved. We support \r\nthe total denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, \r\nwithout foreign interference, with full respect for the \r\nsovereign equality and territorial integrity of the States \r\nconcerned and strict adherence to the principle of the \r\nnon-use or threat of use of force.\r\nToday, new threats are looming over peace and \r\nstability in Latin America and the Caribbean, in open \r\ndisrespect for the Proclamation of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean as a Zone of Peace, signed in Havana \r\nby the Heads of State and Government of our region in \r\nJanuary 2014 at the Second Summit of the Community \r\nof Latin American and Caribbean States. \r\nWe reiterate the statement made on 14 July by \r\nPresident Raúl Modesto Castro Ruz concerning the \r\nBolivarian Republic of Venezuela:\r\n“The aggression and putschist violence against \r\nVenezuela harms all of ‘Our America’ and only \r\nserves the interests of those set on dividing us in \r\norder to exercise their control over our peoples, \r\nunconcerned about causing conflicts of incalculable \r\nconsequence in our region, such as those we are \r\nseeing in various parts of the world.\r\n“Today, we have warned that those attempting \r\nto overthrow the Bolivarian and Chavista revolution \r\nthrough unconstitutional, violent and putschist \r\nmethods will shoulder a serious responsibility in \r\nthe eyes of history.”\r\nWe strongly reject the military threats against \r\nVenezuela, including the United States executive \r\norder that designates Venezuela a threat to the national \r\nsecurity of the United States, and the unilateral, unjust \r\nand arbitrary sanctions applied against it.\r\nWe reiterate our unwavering solidarity with the \r\nBolivarian and Chavista people and Government, and \r\nwith its civic-military union led by Constitutional \r\nPresident Nicolás Maduro Moros. We denounce and \r\ncondemn the Nicaraguan Investment Conditionality \r\nAct initiative promoted in the United States Congress \r\nas part of an interventionist approach intended to \r\nimpose an economic embargo against the people and \r\nthe Government of Nicaragua, to whom we reiterate our \r\nsupport.\r\nWe express our solidarity with former President \r\nLuiz Inácio Lula da Silva, victim of political \r\npersecution intended to prevent him, by means of \r\njudicial disqualification, from running for direct \r\nelections. Lula, President Dilma Rousseff, the Workers’ \r\nParty and the Brazilian people will always find Cuba \r\non their side.\r\nWe reaffirm our historic commitment to the free \r\ndetermination and independence of the people of \r\nPuerto Rico.\r\nWe support the legitimate claim of Argentina for \r\nsovereignty over the Malvinas and the South Sandwich \r\nand South Georgia Islands.\r\nCuba will continue to contribute to the extent \r\npossible, and at the request of the parties involved, to \r\nefforts to achieve a stable and lasting peace in Colombia.\r\nWe will uphold our commitment to share our modest \r\nachievements with the peoples of the South, including \r\nthe efforts of the 40,000 aid workers deployed in 64 \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n8/28 17-29716\r\ncountries, who are fighting today for the life and health \r\nof human beings.\r\nOn 16 June, the President of the United States, \r\nMr. Donald Trump, announced the new Cuba policy \r\nof his Administration, which represents a setback \r\nin bilateral relations and undermines the basis \r\nestablished two years ago for a move towards a new \r\ntype of relationship between our two countries that \r\nwas characterized by respect and equality. The United \r\nStates Government has decided to tighten the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo by imposing new \r\nobstacles to the already limited possibilities that the \r\nUnited States business community has to trade with \r\nand invest in Cuba as well as additional restrictions on \r\nUnited States citizens wishing to travel to our country.\r\nThose decisions have ignored the support on the \r\npart of broad sectors in the United States, including \r\nthe majority of Cuban émigrés, for the lifting of the \r\nblockade and the normalization of relations. They only \r\nserve the interests of a group of individuals of Cuban \r\norigin based in south Florida, which is an increasingly \r\nisolated minority group that insists on harming Cuba \r\nand its people for having decided to defend, at all \r\ncosts, its right to be free, independent and sovereign. \r\nToday, we reiterate our condemnation of the measures \r\naimed at tightening the blockade and reaffirm that any \r\nstrategy intended to destroy the Cuban Revolution will \r\nfail. Likewise, we reject the manipulation of the human \r\nrights issue against Cuba, which has much to be proud \r\nof and has no need for lessons from the United States or \r\nfrom anyone else.\r\nWe wish to express our strongest condemnation \r\nof the disrespectful, offensive and interventionist \r\nstatement against Cuba and the Cuban Government \r\nmade three days ago from this rostrum by President \r\nDonald Trump (see A/72/PV.3). We remind him that the \r\nUnited States, where f lagrant human rights violations \r\nraising deep concerns in the international community \r\nare being committed, does not have the slightest moral \r\nauthority to judge my country. We reaffirm that Cuba \r\nwill never accept any preconditions or impositions, nor \r\nwill it ever renounce any of its principles.\r\nWith regard to the alleged incidents that have \r\nallegedly affected United States diplomatic officials \r\nin Havana, we categorically affirm that the Cuban \r\nGovernment rigorously and seriously abides by its \r\nobligations under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic \r\nRelations to ensure the protection and integrity of all \r\ndiplomats without exception, including those of the \r\nUnited States, and that Cuba has never perpetrated nor \r\nwill it ever perpetrate actions of that sort, nor has it \r\nallowed nor will it ever allow its territory to be used by \r\nthird parties for such purposes. \r\nBased on the preliminary results of the \r\ninvestigation, carried out with priority and with a high \r\ntechnical component, following instructions issued \r\nfrom the highest level of our Government, the Cuban \r\nauthorities, having taken into account data provided by \r\nUnited States authorities, have not found any evidence \r\nwhatsoever that could confirm the cause or the origin of \r\nthe health disorders referred by United States diplomats \r\nand their families. The investigation seeking to clarify \r\nthat issue is ongoing, and in order to be able to reach \r\na conclusion, it will be crucial to able to count on the \r\ncooperation of the United States authorities. It would be \r\nunfortunate if a matter of that nature were to become \r\npoliticized.\r\nAs has been expressed by Cuban President Raúl \r\nCastro Ruz, Cuba is willing to continue negotiating \r\nall pending bilateral issues with the United States, \r\non the basis of equality and absolute respect for the \r\nsovereignty and independence of our country. We will \r\nmaintain a respectful dialogue and cooperation in areas \r\nof common interest with the United States Government. \r\nCuba and the United States can cooperate and coexist, \r\nrespecting our differences and promoting everything \r\nthat benefits both countries and peoples, but no one \r\nshould expect Cuba to make concessions that affect its \r\nsovereignty and independence.\r\nThe Cuban people will not cease their demand \r\nfor the lifting and total elimination of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial blockade and will continue \r\nto denounce the strengthening of that policy. On \r\nNovember 1, Cuba will once again present to the \r\nGeneral Assembly the annual draft resolution entitled \r\n“Necessity of ending the economic, commercial and \r\nfinancial embargo imposed by the United States of \r\nAmerica against Cuba”.\r\nWhile inequality — the opulence of a few and \r\nthe marginalization of many — is growing in today’s \r\nworld, the Cuban people will keep up its struggle to \r\nachieve the most just society possible. We will continue \r\nto steadily advance down the path of revolutionary \r\ntransformation that has been sovereignly chosen by all \r\nCubans to further improve our socialism.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 9/28\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Khemais Jhinaoui, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of Tunisia.\r\nMr. Jhinaoui (Tunisia) (spoke in Arabic): I \r\ncongratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession, and wish him every success in his tasks. \r\nI thank Secretary-General António Guterres for his \r\nefforts to advance the lofty United Nations principles \r\nby promoting the pivotal role of our Organization, \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, and \r\npromoting sustainable development. \r\nI cannot fail to commend the efforts of Mr. Peter \r\nThomson as President of the General Assembly at \r\nits previous session, particularly with regard to the \r\nimplementation of 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. \r\nThe theme of this session, “Focusing on people: \r\nStriving for peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet”, is in line with the priorities of the \r\nTunisian Government for the coming period. In that \r\nrespect, Tunisia has, since 2011, made great strides \r\ntowards democratization and in promoting the rule of \r\nlaw and State institutions. That includes adopting a \r\nConstitution that promotes the values of democracy, \r\nhuman rights, women’s rights and youth rights. We \r\nalso held our first fair and transparent legislative and \r\npresidential elections in 2014. \r\nAs a young democracy, we are pursuing measures \r\naimed at strengthening constitutional institutions and \r\nstructural reforms at all levels, in accordance with a \r\nclear vision and consensus that include all components \r\nof Tunisian society. Achieving development, fighting \r\ncorruption, promoting investment and reducing \r\nunemployment, as well as promoting good governance, \r\nwhile focusing at the same time on combating the \r\nscourge of terrorism and extremism, have presented \r\nmany challenges on which we have focused our \r\nnational capacities. We are confident that brotherly and \r\nfriendly countries and the United Nations will continue \r\nsupporting us in our efforts. We appreciate in particular \r\nthe significant pledges made by many parties to support \r\ndevelopment in Tunisia at the International Conference \r\nto Support Tunisia’s Economic, Social and Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, Tunisia 2020, organized in Tunisia on \r\n29 and 30 November 2016. \r\nI note that Tunisia, in its fight against terrorism, \r\nhas had to redirect a significant portion of its resources \r\noriginally allocated to development. We are confronting \r\nthat scourge by doubling the budget for our military \r\nand security forces. Thanks to the unity of the Tunisian \r\npeople — a society that is premised on justice, equality \r\nand openness — and their commitment to democracy, \r\nwe have been able to combat terrorism and foil its \r\nschemes. That has enabled us to restore security and \r\nstability and improve many economic indicators in our \r\ncountry. \r\nTunisia today is secure, like the majority of the \r\ncountries in the world. It is endeavouring to promote its \r\nyoung democracy and its economy through significant \r\nreforms aimed at establishing a better business \r\nenvironment by attracting foreign investment and \r\npromoting tourism, as well as by seeking comprehensive \r\ndevelopment and meeting the needs and demands of our \r\nyoung people with regard to employment and a decent \r\nlife. \r\nThe scourge of terrorism derives its strength from \r\nproliferating hotbeds of tension, conflict and violent \r\nextremism. That exacerbates the challenges facing the \r\ninternational community’s fight against that menace, \r\nwhich excludes no region and recognizes no borders. \r\nTerrorism is also linked to all types of organized crime, \r\nthe influx of refugees and migrants, human trafficking \r\nand the consequent large-scale violations of universal \r\nhuman rights. \r\nCombating terrorism requires international \r\ncooperation and comprehensive and inclusive strategic \r\npartnership. We are confident that boosting the economy \r\nand development of our country, while working to \r\nensure social peace and security, requires the active \r\nengagement of the international community at large in \r\nsupporting our implementation of all the ambitious goals \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in \r\nparticular those that address environmental challenges, \r\nwhile mitigating the impacts of climate change on the \r\neconomies of developing countries and the livelihoods \r\nof their people. We have therefore mainstreamed those \r\ngoals in our national development plan for 2016-2020, \r\nand we have embarked upon implementing them in \r\ncollaboration with the competent international agencies \r\nand regional structures — in particular the African \r\nUnion, given the nexus between those goals and Agenda \r\n2063 for African development.\r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n10/28 17-29716\r\nWe are also preparing to release our first national \r\nreport on the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals for the consideration of the High-\r\nlevel Political Forum on Sustainable Development. In \r\nthat respect, we would like to reiterate that it is important \r\nto take into account the priorities and specificities \r\nof each region and country when dealing with the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. Optimal utilization of all international \r\nand regional mechanisms, especially those dedicated \r\nto the financing of development, technology transfer \r\nand capacity-building, would support the efforts of \r\nAfrican nations to achieve steady economic growth and \r\nsustainable development so as to put an end to poverty, \r\nmarginalization and epidemics and work towards \r\npeaceful, just, inclusive and prosperous African \r\ncommunities.\r\nWe believe that environmental considerations \r\nare important in achieving sustainable development \r\nfor all the world’s nations. We therefore signed the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change in 2015, and we \r\nvoluntarily committed to reducing our gas emissions \r\nby 41 per cent by 2030. Our commitment has also been \r\ndemonstrated by the nationally determined contribution \r\ndevoted to the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change.\r\nTunisia upholds the principles of international \r\nlegitimacy and supports all efforts aimed at \r\nmaintaining international peace and security, in \r\nparticular by strengthening our contributions to United \r\nNations peacekeeping and peacebuilding operations. \r\nTherefore, efforts to promote the principles of justice \r\nand equality in international relations would benefit \r\nfrom improvements in the effectiveness of the United \r\nNations work and its organs, in particular the Security \r\nCouncil, so that the Organization can better assume \r\nits crucial responsibility of maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\nThe security and stability of the Arab region is \r\nan integral part of the world’s stability. We therefore \r\ncall for immediate political settlements of issues in \r\nour region, in particular the Palestine issue, which \r\nrequires a comprehensive solution that brings justice \r\nto the Palestinian people, ends their suffering and \r\nenables them to recover their legitimate historical \r\nrights — especially the establishment of an independent \r\nState with East Jerusalem as its capital, in accordance \r\nwith international parameters and the Arab Peace \r\nInitiative.\r\nI seize this opportunity to reiterate our ongoing \r\nconcern over the Libyan crisis, and we reiterate Tunisia’s \r\ncommitment to stand by our Libyan brethren and urge \r\nthem to bridge their differences and swiftly find a \r\ncomprehensive political settlement to the crisis there. \r\nWithin the framework of our mediation efforts among \r\nLibyan protagonists, our President Essebsi launched \r\nan initiative in December 2016 for a comprehensive \r\npolitical settlement of the Libyan crisis. Tunisia, \r\nbelieving in the role of neighbouring countries, has \r\nbeen keen to ensure positive engagement with Algeria \r\nand Egypt on the issue, so that we join our efforts to \r\nhelp the Libyans to end their differences and proceed \r\nwith the political solutions sponsored by the United \r\nNations.\r\nIt is important to unite international efforts on the \r\nLibyan situation, so that we can ensure progress on the \r\npolitical path and achieve convergence among Libyans \r\nunder the supervision of the United Nations and the \r\nSpecial Representative of the Secretary-General for \r\nLibya. That is especially true given that our Organization \r\nis the guarantor for implementing commitments and \r\nis capable of adapting any amended agreement in \r\naccordance with Security Council resolutions. We seek \r\nin that connection to prevent any vacuum, which could \r\nworsen the anarchy and instability.\r\nWe commend the efforts of the Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General, Mr. Ghassan \r\nSalamé, and we support the road map that he put \r\nforward on the holding of the High-level Meeting on \r\nLibya on 20 September and his call for the Dialogue \r\nCommittee — comprising the Libyan House of \r\nRepresentatives and the State High Council — to launch \r\na new round of talks in Tunisia within the framework \r\nof the United Nations Support Mission in Libya and, \r\nunder his supervision, to introduce the consensual \r\namendments to the Libyan Political Agreement of \r\nSkhirat. We hope that that step will act as a springboard \r\nfor reconciliation and consensus in Libya.\r\nWe reiterate today that it is important to reach a \r\ncomprehensive and immediate political settlement to \r\nthe situation in Syria, and we urge the Syrian parties \r\nto give priority to the vital interests of their nation \r\nwith a view to reaching a consensus that preserves the \r\nunity and territorial integrity of Syria, putting an end to \r\nthe catastrophic humanitarian tragedy endured by the \r\nSyrian people and addressing the serious ramifications \r\nof that conflict at the regional and international levels.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 11/28\r\nWe are gravely concerned at the exacerbation of \r\nthe security and humanitarian situation in Yemen. \r\nThat calls for redoubling international efforts to push \r\nforward political consultations aimed at finding a \r\nsolution to that crisis in a manner that preserves the \r\nterritorial integrity and resilience of the country, and \r\nputs an end to the humanitarian suffering endured by \r\nthe Yemeni people. With regard to Iraq, we commend \r\nthe fact that that brotherly country, in collaboration \r\nwith the international coalition against Da’esh, has \r\nmade significant progress in its war against terror. We \r\nreiterate Tunisia’s solidarity with Iraq in combating \r\nthat serious scourge.\r\nRegarding the situation of the Rohingya Muslims in \r\nMyanmar, we reiterate our condemnation of the f lagrant \r\nviolations of human rights against that minority. We \r\nappeal to the international community to shoulder its \r\nresponsibilities and to swiftly intervene to provide the \r\nnecessary protection, ensure access to humanitarian \r\nassistance and save those people from the atrocities that \r\nthey have been enduring.\r\nWe are confronted with many serious challenges and \r\nissues, such as hotbeds of tension, conflicts, combating \r\nterrorism and extremists, addressing the proliferation \r\nof weapons of mass destruction, supporting human \r\nrights, implementing development goals and reforming \r\nthe United Nations, among other crucial matters. The \r\nrole of the United Nations is, thus, central in finding \r\nsolutions to deal with those challenges. There is also a \r\ngreat responsibility that we need to bear in confronting \r\nthe challenges caused by international transformations, \r\nfor which we need to shore up our efforts. On this \r\noccasion, I would like to commend the efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General to develop the United Nations \r\nsystem, particularly with regard to the repositioning \r\nof the United Nations development system and the \r\npromotion of a preventive approach in resolving \r\ninternational conflicts and maintaining international \r\npeace and security.\r\nIn conclusion, we reiterate Tunisia’s resolve to \r\ncontinue to contribute actively to international action \r\naimed at finding sound approaches and solutions to \r\nthose difficult issues in a manner that preserves human \r\ndignity and enables the nations of the world to devote \r\ntheir efforts and resources to achieve comprehensive \r\nand sustainable development in a world of tolerance and \r\nintercultural solidarity among nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Don Pramudwinai, Minister for Foreign Affairs of \r\nthe Kingdom of Thailand. \r\nMr. Pramudwinai (Thailand): I believe that I speak \r\non behalf of everyone here when I say that our hearts \r\nand prayers are with everyone in the small States of \r\nthe Caribbean, now facing the devastating effects of a \r\nseries of hurricanes. Our deepest sympathy and prayers \r\nare also with the people of Mexico, who have suffered \r\nimmensely from the deadly earthquake on Tuesday.\r\nOver the past few days, the words “we the peoples” \r\nhave been echoed in the General Assembly many times. \r\nThailand shares the view of Secretary-General Guterres \r\nand many Member States that we need to focus more \r\non people and less on bureaucracy. The United Nations \r\nmust be less about debates and more about actions that \r\ntruly impact changes on the ground.\r\nIn the General Assembly this year, it is gratifying \r\nto hear world leaders focusing on people. The life, \r\nsurvival and prosperity of a nation depend on the quality \r\nof life of its people. When people live decent lives, they \r\nthrive and, in turn, nations and our planet prosper. On \r\nthe other hand, if people still have to struggle in their \r\ndaily lives, have nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, no \r\nschooling or health-care access, then the advancement \r\nof nations would be an unrealizable ambition. That is \r\nwhy we must focus on people.\r\nIn fact, we have long focused on the people of \r\nThailand. Our late King, His Majesty King Bhumibol \r\nAdulyadej, told us to listen to the people and to \r\nlearn from them. He said that those living in the \r\ncommunity know best about their conditions and needs. \r\nDevelopment must not be top-down but bottom-up and \r\nmust vary according to specific contexts. His Majesty \r\nlaid the groundwork for the people-centred approach \r\nthrough the “sufficiency economy” philosophy, which \r\nstresses self-development and places emphasis on \r\neveryone’s potential to mould their own future and \r\nlive in harmony with nature. When each person can \r\ncontribute meaningfully to his or her community, the \r\nlife of the nation will surely be good.\r\nBased on the sufficiency economy philosophy, \r\nthe Royal Thai Government envisions the lives of our \r\npeople and the life of our nation as stable, prosperous \r\nand sustainable. Our key national frameworks, namely, \r\nthe 2017 Constitution, the 20-year National Strategy \r\nFramework and the twelfth National Economic and \r\nSocial Development Plan, have all been formulated to \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n12/28 17-29716\r\nfocus on people first. Thailand has stepped up efforts \r\nto put in place a decentralized area-based development \r\npolicy to empower those who will be affected and create \r\na space to appreciate local wisdom and knowledge.\r\nAt the same time, Thailand is seeking to utilize \r\nscience, technology and innovation to strengthen human \r\ncapabilities and foster an enabling environment in our \r\ndevelopment paradigm. Currently, we aim to build a \r\nvalue-based economy under the Thailand 4.0 policy. \r\nThe value-based economy encompasses various types \r\nof economy: a circular economy, in which resources are \r\nutilized efficiently and in an environmentally friendly \r\nmanner; a distributive economy, where development is \r\ninclusive; and an innovative economy, where growth \r\nsprings from ideas and knowledge. The value-based \r\neconomy under the Thailand 4.0 policy requires human \r\nwisdom even more than high technology. That is why \r\nwe are focusing on our people and putting human \r\nlife-cycle development as our priority.\r\nSince 2002, we have successfully embarked upon \r\nour universal health coverage system. That system \r\nrepresents an investment in our people and our \r\nfuture. At present, 99.87 per cent of the population \r\nenjoys some kind of health coverage. The Universal \r\nHealth Coverage system has helped prevent more than \r\n100,000 households from falling into poverty over \r\nthe past decade. As Chair of the Foreign Policy and \r\nGlobal Health Initiative, Thailand will present a draft \r\nresolution at this session of the General Assembly to \r\nmark 12 December as World Universal Health Coverage \r\nDay. We hope to receive support from Member States \r\nin that regard.\r\nAnother recent example of how we focus on people \r\nis our national strategy to eliminate HIV/AIDS. By 2030, \r\nThailand aims to reduce new HIV infections, lower \r\nthe number of HIV/AIDS-related deaths and reduce \r\ndiscrimination related to HIV and gender. We are also \r\nproud to say that in 2016 the World Health Organization \r\nrecognized Thailand as the first country in Asia, and \r\nthe second country in the world, to eliminate mother-\r\nto-child transmission of HIV and syphilis.\r\nThe world is going through a critical time and is \r\nfacing a series of shared challenges, such as extremism, \r\nterrorism, ongoing conflicts and irregular migration, \r\nalong with environmental degradation, climate change \r\nand natural disasters. Another grave concern is the \r\nnuclear threat, which is looming over us and feels \r\nmore real now than ever before. It is at times like \r\nthis that humankind is truly being tested. Two days \r\nago Thailand signed and deposited our instrument of \r\nratification to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. We are proud to be among the first countries \r\nto do so. We wish to call on others to do the same. By \r\ndoing so, we are sending a message to our children and \r\ngrandchildren that we care.\r\nThailand shares the international community’s \r\ngrave concern about the situation on the Korean \r\npeninsula, where we encourage all parties to find a \r\npeaceful solution, along with the full implementation \r\nof Security Council resolutions.\r\nThailand is also deeply concerned about ongoing \r\nviolence and conflicts elsewhere in the world, including \r\nthe situation in Rakhine state, which recently caused \r\nhundreds of thousands of people to leave their homes. \r\nWe are fully aware of the complexities of humanitarian \r\nsituations, which cannot be solved overnight. Those \r\nsituations call for long-term political and socioeconomic \r\nsolutions. Sustaining peace and sustaining development \r\nmust go hand in hand.\r\nIn order to enable people to have decent lives, we \r\nmust build inclusive societies where everyone has a \r\nsense of belonging and feels that his/her voice is heard \r\nand their views taken into consideration. We must \r\nempower the most vulnerable in our societies — those \r\nsuffering in poverty, women, children and persons with \r\ndisabilities — and leave no one behind. Their rights and \r\ndignity must be respected. They must be protected by \r\nlaw and have equal access to justice. Only then can we \r\nrealize a truly inclusive society with sustainable peace \r\nand development.\r\nTo sum up, my delegation would like to leave the \r\nAssembly with three key messages. \r\nFirst, multilateralism and the United Nations \r\nin particular, has a great role to play in fostering the \r\nquality of our people’s lives. The United Nations must \r\ntake transformative steps to live up to today’s reality \r\nand expectations. Development programmes, financial \r\nand technical assistance, peace operations, security \r\nsanctions, resource mobilization, and environmental \r\nprotection programmes must all truly enhance the \r\nquality of life of the people. The work of the United \r\nNations must have real impact on the ground. The \r\nUnited Nations must be able to identify challenges based \r\non the needs and particular situations of each country, \r\nand must be able to adapt its work in a responsive and \r\nf lexible manner. It must also address the root cause of \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 13/28\r\neach problem, especially by addressing structural gaps \r\nand focusing more on prevention rather than on curing \r\nsymptoms.\r\nWe look forward to hearing more details on \r\nthe United Nations development system reform and \r\nhow it would impact action on the ground, enhance \r\nresource efficiency and synergize the work of regional \r\ncommissions and United Nations country teams. We \r\nalso wish to hear about innovative resource mobilization \r\nand enhanced partnerships with all stakeholders, \r\nespecially the private sector, academia and civil society. \r\nPartnerships, particularly with science, technology \r\nand innovation communities, would bring about the \r\ntransformative push that is required in order to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\r\nSecondly, we must learn to mobilize each of our \r\ndiverse individual strengths. We must ensure that local \r\nwisdom and community knowledge are appreciated and \r\nintegrated into our efforts. We must create a culture of \r\npartnerships that is based on mutual trust and respect. \r\nFor our part, Thailand recognizes and appreciates the \r\ndiversity of strengths of each stakeholder. We value the \r\nsharing of knowledge and experiences. It is in that spirit \r\nthat Thailand has launched the sufficiency economy \r\nphilosophy for the SDGs partnership so as to encourage \r\nthe sharing of the sufficiency economy philosophy in \r\nadvancing the SDGs. As part of our efforts to promote \r\nSouth-South cooperation, last year Thailand supported \r\nthe reopening of the United Nations Office for South-\r\nSouth Cooperation for Asia and the Pacific in Thailand \r\nand has provided human resources to the Office.\r\nLast but not least, focusing on people is not only \r\nabout working on their external conditions. The first \r\nstep of a successful transformation is to work on their \r\nmindsets, especially those of children and youth. \r\nWe must not forget them, and their voices must be \r\nheard — the future belongs to them. Therefore, we must \r\nensure that children today grow up to become citizens \r\nof the world with global mindsets.\r\nEveryone can be an agent of change. If people \r\nhave a decent life and feel content with what they \r\nhave, eventually they will want to give and share. Our \r\nrole as Governments is to support people, create an \r\nenvironment that enables them to be able to give and \r\nshare, and let people drive change.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Julie Bishop, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nCommonwealth of Australia.\r\nMs. Bishop (Australia): The United Nations was \r\nfounded in response to the horrors of the Second \r\nWorld War. Nations resolved to prevent a repeat of that \r\ncatastrophic global conflict. Over the decades since, we \r\nhave worked together to build an international rules-\r\nbased order that ensures that disputes can be resolved \r\npeacefully and the interests of less powerful nations \r\ncan be protected from the overt or coercive pressure of \r\nmore powerful States. That order dictates how nations \r\nshould behave towards each other. It has supported and \r\nenabled the greatest economic expansion in human \r\nhistory. There have been times over the past seven \r\ndecades when the rules-based order has been under \r\npressure. We are now in a time when the challenges to \r\nthat order are increasing.\r\nThe Security Council is the custodian of \r\ninternational peace and security. Yet the authority \r\nof the Council is being challenged, undermined and \r\neven ignored. The most egregious example of that is \r\nNorth Korea. The regime of Kim Jong Un is openly \r\ndefying the Security Council. Its illegal nuclear and \r\nmissile programmes violate multiple Security Council \r\nresolutions. The security of millions of people is at \r\nrisk as a result of North Korea’s refusal to abide by \r\ninternational laws and norms.\r\nThe International Monitoring System of the \r\nComprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty confirms that \r\nNorth Korea is the only State that is currently testing \r\nnuclear weapons, and the only State to do so this \r\ncentury. The Security Council has responded with tough \r\nnew economic sanctions. It is crucial that all Member \r\nStates, especially the five permanent members, which \r\nhave a particular responsibility, strictly implement \r\nthose sanctions so as to compel North Korea to abandon \r\nits illegal programmes.\r\nThe authority of the Council must be defended \r\nand upheld. Australia will play its part in helping to \r\nresolve that crisis. We have already put in place a range \r\nof autonomous sanctions beyond those mandated by \r\nthe Security Council. We will explore further options \r\nshould North Korea continue its f lagrant disregard of \r\nthe views of the international community, as upheld by \r\nthe Security Council.\r\nThe rules-based order is also being challenged \r\nby non-State actors, terrorists and violent extremists. \r\nGlobal terrorism and the extreme Islamist ideologies \r\ndriving it must be confronted and defeated. Many \r\nnations, including Australia, have suffered terrorist \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n14/28 17-29716\r\nattacks. We can most effectively combat and defeat \r\nterrorism if we work together, sharing our knowledge \r\nand resources. Our work has continued this week at \r\nmeetings of the Global Counterterrorism Forum and \r\nthe United States-led coalition against Da’esh. \r\nThe use of chemical weapons presents another \r\nserious threat to the rules-based order. We know that \r\nthey were used in Syria. Australia supports the work \r\nof the United Nations and the Organization for the \r\nProhibition of Chemical Weapons in identifying those \r\nwho deployed such appalling illegal weapons. That \r\nwork must continue. Australia chairs the 42-member \r\nAustralia Group, which works to prevent the spread of \r\nchemical and biological weapons.\r\nOur rules-based order has been supported by \r\ninstitutions and, over the decades, United Nations \r\npeacekeepers have become the defining image of \r\nthe United Nations response to conflict and security \r\nthreats. Fifteen peacekeeping missions are currently \r\ndeployed across four continents. Often, they are the only \r\nauthority preventing civil breakdown and lawlessness \r\nin countries that are already suffering from conflict, \r\npoverty and despair.\r\nAustralia has been a long-term supporter of United \r\nNations peacekeeping. Last week in Canberra, we \r\ncommemorated the seventieth anniversary of the first \r\nsuch mission, noting that, in 1947, Australia was the \r\nfirst nation to deploy into the field military observers \r\nto monitor the ceasefire in the then Dutch East Indies. \r\nWe have contributed to 20 more United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions.\r\nWe support the work that is under way to ensure that \r\nUnited Nations peacekeepers are better trained, better \r\nequipped, more effective and act with greater integrity. \r\nPeacekeepers operate in dangerous and unpredictable \r\nenvironments and represent one of the most important \r\nglobal investments in peace and security.\r\nAustralia welcomes the new Secretary-General, \r\nwho has committed to reforming the United Nations \r\nin order to make it more effective as the defender \r\nand upholder of the rules-based order. Australia fully \r\nsupports Secretary-General Guterres in that endeavour. \r\nThe United Nations must focus on conflict prevention, \r\nas that is more effective than dealing with the tragic \r\nconsequences of conflict. United Nations management \r\nsystems must be made more efficient and accountable. \r\nThere must be more women in senior positions. In order \r\nto achieve reform, Secretary-General Guterres needs \r\nthe full support of Member States. \r\nThe standing of the United Nations is maximized \r\nwhen we work together for the common good. Recent \r\nsuccesses prove that to be true, such as the global Arms \r\nTrade Treaty, the Paris Agreement on Climate Change \r\nand the Sustainable Development Goals. If we are to \r\nmeet the challenges of our age, we must be guided by \r\na spirit of cooperation and compromise. Central to our \r\ntask is achieving sustainable and inclusive development. \r\nThe United Nations must play a more effective and \r\nagile role.\r\nThe development system of the United Nations \r\nshould be more focused on sustainable economic \r\ndevelopment aimed at providing employment \r\nopportunities and facilitating partnerships with the \r\nprivate sector. Economic development and security are \r\ninterlinked. One cannot be achieved without the other. \r\nEach country has to find its own model for prosperity \r\nand stability. However, there are many lessons to \r\nbe learned from other nations, and much support is \r\navailable for nations that are seeking to establish \r\nregulatory frameworks, particularly with respect to \r\nsupporting private investment that helps economies to \r\ngrow and generates employment. Economic resilience \r\ncan also be undermined by natural and man-made \r\ndisasters.\r\nWith the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement, \r\nthe Sendai Declaration and the World Humanitarian \r\nSummit’s grand bargain, there is a blueprint for \r\nglobal action that addresses the problems that can be \r\naddressed only by working together on the challenges \r\nwe face, which do not respect national borders. That \r\nincludes climate change, diseases, including malaria, \r\nthe management of our precious water resources, and \r\nmodern slavery. It is an unpalatable truth that forced \r\nlabour, child labour, human trafficking and modern \r\nslavery are rampant in the world. Australia has strongly \r\ncommitted to working with the international community \r\nto urgently address those egregious crimes. Last month, \r\nAustralia and Indonesia jointly launched the world’s \r\nfirst regional business-Government partnership aimed \r\nat addressing modern slavery, and we have continued \r\nour advocacy on that issue with other nations this week. \r\nWe will end such abhorrent practices. I want to pay \r\ntribute to Andrew, Nicola and Grace Forest for starting \r\nthe Walk Free Foundation and inspiring our work.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 15/28\r\nAustralia is a strong supporter of the Paris \r\nAgreement, and here at the United Nations we have \r\nvoiced our support, specifically on risk mitigation \r\nfor coral reefs, which are among the most valuable \r\nenvironments on our planet. They support more \r\nbiodiversity than almost any other ecosystem, are \r\nvital to the world’s fisheries, protect our coastlines \r\nand generate significant tourist revenue. Coral reefs \r\nsequester four times more carbon than forests and are a \r\nvital element in our global efforts to reduce emissions. \r\nWorldwide, more than 30 coral reefs are listed as \r\nWorld Heritage Sites, and 29 are under stress. As the \r\ncustodians of the Great Barrier Reef and with our \r\nextensive experience in reef management, we seek to \r\nbring our expertise to other locations. We hope to serve \r\non the World Heritage Committee next year.\r\nAustralia has worked with other countries on each \r\nof those issues during the past week. We are mindful \r\nthat no matter how much we work on building strong, \r\nresilient societies, crises will still occur. Australia has \r\nbeen a strong contributor to relief efforts in Iraq and \r\nSyria, as well as in South Sudan, Somalia and Yemen, \r\nwhere there are significant numbers of displaced people \r\nat increasing risk of famine. Australia is also supporting \r\nthose displaced by conflict in Rakhine state, Myanmar. \r\nWe are contributing to funding life-saving food for up \r\nto 300,000 people.\r\nAustralia also seeks to serve, for the first time, \r\non the Human Rights Council, starting in 2018. I am \r\ngrateful for the strong support from so many countries \r\nfor our candidacy. If elected, we will be a principled \r\nand pragmatic member of the Council. Australia would \r\nbe the first nation from the South-West Pacific on the \r\nCouncil. We will promote an agenda relevant both to \r\nour region and to the planet. Empowering women and \r\ngirls so that they can reach their full potential lifts a \r\ncountry’s productivity and underpins stability. We \r\nwill support the freedom of expression. The number \r\nof journalists and human rights defenders detained, \r\nabused or killed each year should be of grave concern \r\nto us all. We will support good governance and strong \r\ndemocratic institutions. Similarly, we will promote \r\nstrong, independent national human rights institutions \r\nin order to raise awareness of human rights, address \r\nviolations and hold to account those responsible for \r\nabuses.\r\nAustralia is proud to be the home of the world’s \r\noldest continuous culture, and we will strive to advance \r\nthe human rights of indigenous peoples around the \r\nglobe. Australia reaffirms its commitment to the \r\nDeclaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We \r\nwill also work with other members to enhance the \r\neffectiveness of the Human Rights Council, so that its \r\nwork can make a meaningful difference to the lives of \r\nindividuals around the world. The Council must remain \r\nrelevant to the broader international agenda, while \r\nmaking a contribution to building stable, prosperous \r\nand compassionate societies.\r\nWe all strive for an environment in which countries \r\ncan grow and prosper and in which individuals can \r\naspire to a life unburdened by the threat of violence, \r\nan environment driven by a shared vision of peace, \r\ncompassion and community. For its part, Australia \r\nwill work with others to protect an international order \r\nthat ensures that all States can pursue their interests \r\nsecurely and supports cooperative responses to global \r\nchallenges. \r\nThe United Nations can become an even more \r\npowerful force for stability in an uncertain world. It \r\ncan live up to the ideals and universal principles on \r\nwhich it was founded. The people of our world expect \r\nthe Organization to inspire the best in human nature, \r\nand that is our duty.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Péter Szijjártó, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade of Hungary.\r\nMr. Szijjártó (Hungary): At the outset, I would \r\nlike to congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election \r\nto the presidency of the General Assembly. For those \r\nof us from Central Europe, it is highly significant that \r\na Central European candidate was elected to such an \r\nimportant position. It shows that Central Europe is a \r\nstrong region that has attained success through policies \r\nthat are based on rationality and common sense. His \r\nelection, along with the fact that Poland was elected \r\nto the Security Council as a non-permanent member, \r\nserves as proof that the Visegrad Group is strong and \r\ncapable of speaking with a loud, united voice.\r\nNow, as we convene at the General Assembly, it \r\nis evident that we are living in extremely challenging \r\ntimes. Economic, political, defence and military \r\nrelations are changing extremely rapidly. Coming from \r\nCentral Europe, I would like to highlight three very \r\nimportant issues from our perspective: migration and \r\nthe threat of terrorism, the relationship between the \r\nEast and the West, and the rights of national minorities.\r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n16/28 17-29716\r\nEurope currently finds itself on the front lines of \r\nsignificant global changes. Since the end of the Cold \r\nWar, Europe has never had to face as many challenges \r\nas it does now. As a result of the migration crisis, \r\nEurope is facing the most serious threat of terrorism in \r\nits history. The European Union is facing its toughest \r\nchallenges since its foundation. Western Europe used \r\nto be the most secure, safest and most peaceful region \r\nglobally. A couple of years ago, we watched the news \r\non television about terror in the Middle East, and we \r\nwere sure that such events would surely never take \r\nplace in Europe. To the contrary, the fear of terrorist \r\nattacks has become a part of everyday life. Between \r\n2015 and 2017, Europe suffered 30 major terror attacks, \r\nwhich took 300 innocent lives. Churches, airports, \r\nbeaches and concerts have become sites for execution, \r\nwhich can take place within a couple of seconds. That \r\ndevelopment is a direct consequence of two phenomena. \r\nThe first is the massive influx of illegal migrants. \r\nDuring the past two and a half years, 1.5 million \r\nillegal migrants have entered European Union territory \r\nwithout any kind of control, checks or regulation. That \r\nhas definitely provided an opportunity for terrorist \r\norganizations to take advantage of that f low and send \r\ntheir terrorists and fighters to the European continent.\r\nSecondly — and here I will surely offend some by \r\nbreaking taboos and challenging dogma — we must \r\nadmit that the earlier social integration procedures in \r\nthe Western part of Europe have failed. Some of the \r\nattempts to integrate migrants who arrived in Europe \r\npreviously have been totally unsuccessful and, in many \r\nplaces in Western Europe, parallel societies have been \r\nconstructed.\r\nWe must honestly admit that we are shocked, \r\nafter the barbaric terrorist attacks in Europe, the \r\nmassive violations of national and international laws \r\nand regulations, and the loss of thousands of lives \r\non the Mediterranean Sea and elsewhere, that there \r\nare still leaders of international organizations and \r\nrepresentatives of powerful countries who claim \r\nforcefully that migration is a favourable phenomenon \r\nthat is to be encouraged. That is extremely irresponsible \r\nand unacceptable behaviour. Encouraging waves of \r\nmigrants endangers tens of thousands of people — there \r\nare those who risk their lives to reach a place where they \r\nthink they might find a better way of life, and those \r\nwho are put at risk of becoming victims of the terrorists \r\nwho seek to take advantage of those migratory waves.\r\nHungary’s position is quite clear. All States have \r\nthe fundamental right and responsibility to ensure \r\nthe security of their own people, all States have the \r\nfundamental right and responsibility to protect their \r\nown borders, and all States have the fundamental \r\nright and responsibility to make decisions on their \r\nown — including as to whom they allow to enter their \r\nterritory and whom they do not.\r\nHungary has made enormous efforts to comply \r\nwith its international obligations. We have spent \r\n€800 million on protecting not only ourselves and the \r\nborder of Hungary but also the external border of the \r\nEuropean Union and the external border of the Schengen \r\nArea. We have also built physical infrastructure and \r\nmobilized human resources. Again, altogether that has \r\ncost €800 million.\r\nI must remind the Assembly that this is not the first \r\ntime in history that we have had to protect the Western \r\npart of Europe as well as ourselves. But of course, as \r\nwe are a Christian country, we accept our responsibility \r\nto help those in need. Hungary’s principle is to provide \r\nhelp when it is needed, and that is why we help and \r\nassist Christian communities in the Middle East so that \r\nthey can stay or return once conflicts are over.\r\nWe have spent almost €2 million rebuilding 200 \r\nhouses in the Iraqi township of Telsqof, making it \r\npossible for more than 1,300 people to return. We have \r\nspent €4 million on building schools, covering medical \r\nexpenses and ensuring that Christian communities are \r\nable to stay and f lourish. We offer 100 scholarships on \r\nan annual basis to youngsters whose families are being \r\npersecuted in the region.\r\nWe understand that the rights of people should be \r\nrestored when they have been violated. We must work \r\nto help people stay as close to their homes as possible, \r\nand we have to help people return to their homes as soon \r\nas possible. We call for more support for countries that \r\nhave taken care of refugees from war-torn areas, such \r\nas Turkey, Jordan, Lebanon and the Kurdish region of \r\nIraq. However, we are all aware that a complete and \r\ndefinitive solution for the migration crisis can emerge \r\nonly by tackling the root causes, which includes \r\novercoming military conflicts beyond Europe’s borders \r\nand eliminating terrorist organizations. \r\nI would like to turn now to my second point, \r\nnamely, the relationship between the East and the West. \r\nI represent a small Central European country, and we \r\nare all aware that major international conflicts can \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 17/28\r\nbe resolved through agreements between the super-\r\nPowers of the West and the East. This is why pragmatic \r\ncooperation between East and West is necessary if we \r\nwish to eliminate the most dangerous terrorist groups \r\nworldwide. Hungary is therefore proud to contribute \r\n200 troops to the fight against the Islamic State in Iraq \r\nand the Sham.\r\nCooperation between the East and the West is \r\nnecessary if we wish to overcome the war and create \r\npeace in Syria, thereby making it possible for people to \r\nreturn and in order to decrease the migratory pressure \r\non Europe. It is necessary to create peace in Libya and \r\nensure stability there for the future. It is also necessary \r\nto address the extraordinary challenge posed by a \r\ncommunist dictator who is threatening the world with a \r\nnuclear programme, violating all possible international \r\nregulations and values.\r\nWe Central Europeans read this from history: \r\nwhenever there is a conflict between the East and the \r\nWest, Central Europe will certainly lose out. We do not \r\nwant to be losers anymore. That is why we call for a \r\nbetter and more pragmatic relationship and cooperation \r\nbetween the East and the West based on mutual trust \r\nand respect for each other and for international law.\r\nIn my third, and final, point from a Central European \r\nangle, I would like to highlight the importance of the \r\nrights of national minorities, which is a highly sensitive \r\nissue for Hungary, as millions of Hungarians live \r\noutside our borders. The rights of national minorities \r\nare among the most highly protected in international \r\nrelations. There is an international consensus — we \r\nbelieve, at least — that the rights of national minorities \r\nmust be respected by all members of the international \r\ncommunity, and discrimination against any kind of \r\nminority is simply unacceptable.\r\nOne of the most important elements of national \r\nminority rights is the right to use and receive \r\neducation in one’s mother tongue. Why is that so \r\nimportant? Because the best way to create difficulties \r\nfor national minorities is to prohibit them from using \r\ntheir native language by law. It is not an accident that \r\nlanguage rights are also enshrined in a variety of \r\nguiding documents and international standards on the \r\nmatter, such as the 1992 United Nations Declaration \r\non the Rights of Persons Belonging to National or \r\nEthnic, Religious and Linguistic Minorities, the three \r\nprinciples on language and education of UNESCO and \r\nthe various recommendations of the United Nations \r\nForum on Minority Issues on the implementation of the \r\nthe Declaration. Those documents describe a similar \r\nbasic approach for State authorities to meet their human \r\nrights obligations involving language.\r\nUnfortunately, the Parliament of Ukraine adopted \r\na new law on education on 5 September. That new law \r\ndrastically curbs the already acquired level of minority \r\nrights in education and language use. The new law takes \r\naway the right to receive an education in their mother \r\ntongue from all children older than 10. It is a shame \r\nthat we are seeing that kind of legislation adopted in \r\nthe twenty-first century in a country that is making \r\ngreat efforts to make quick progress on the economic \r\nintegration process of its Association Agreement with \r\nthe European Union. That law clearly discriminates \r\nagainst the minorities living in Ukraine.\r\nArticle 1 of the UNESCO Convention against \r\nDiscrimination in Education clearly states that,\r\n“[t]he term ‘discrimination’ includes any \r\ndistinction, exclusion, limitation or preference \r\nwhich, being based on race, colour, sex, language, \r\nreligion, political or other opinion, national or \r\nsocial origin, economic condition or birth, has \r\nthe purpose or effect of nullifying or impairing \r\nequality of treatment in education”.\r\nIt is obvious that the new Ukrainian law on education \r\nclearly violates those United Nations conventions and \r\ninternational norms. We therefore stress that it would \r\nestablish a very dangerous precedent if the United \r\nNations were not to act and remained silent in that regard. \r\nWe strongly urge the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights to begin investigating \r\nthe new Ukrainian law on education and use all the \r\nmeans at his disposal to address the serious violations \r\nof fundamental minority rights brought on by the new \r\nUkrainian law.\r\nHungary will always stand by Hungarian \r\ncommunities, regardless where they live in the world, \r\nand we will never let them down. That is our obligation. \r\nThat is our responsibility, and it comes from our heart, \r\nas well.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Abdelkader Messahel, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Algeria.\r\nMr. Messahel (Algeria) (spoke in Arabic): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to express my warmest \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. Miroslav \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n18/28 17-29716\r\nLajčák on his election to the presidency to the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. We assure him \r\nof my country’s full support. I would also like to express \r\nmy appreciation and gratitude to his predecessor, His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson, Foreign Minister of Fiji. \r\nI thank him for the excellent work that he performed \r\nduring the past session\r\nAt each session of the General Assembly, we \r\nrepeat our diagnosis of the miserable state of the world. \r\nUnfortunately, this session is no exception, given that \r\nit is being held in a context in which protracted crises \r\ncontinue, new and bloody conflicts are breaking out \r\nand hotspots are waiting for settlements that are harder \r\nto achieve than ever before. Our time is also marked \r\nby the fragile ecological balance of the planet owing \r\nto all of the damage that it has incurred. We add to \r\nthat extreme poverty, backwardness and diseases that \r\ncontinue to kill millions, as well as threats spreading \r\nacross borders, such as terrorism and the associated \r\norganized crime, which directly affect the safety and \r\nstability of our countries.\r\nThe challenges that we face cannot be \r\nunderestimated, nor can they be ignored. In every \r\nsituation, we must not doubt our ability to confront \r\nthose challenges and overcome them. In the words of \r\nPresident Abdelaziz Bouteflika, which he shared with \r\nthe General Assembly as President at its twenty-ninth \r\nsession in 1974: \r\n “[o]ur responsibility is less to turn our backs on \r\nreality than, rather, to face up to it rigorously and \r\nvigilantly”. (A/PV.2233, para. 27)\r\nDespite the fact that the United Nations can be improved \r\nin more than one area, it remains the only crucial means \r\nat nations’ disposal and has been described by President \r\nBouteflika as representing a monument of harmony and \r\nsolidarity among all the nations of the world.\r\n I would like to express our satisfaction with the \r\ntopic of this year’s session, namely, “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on \r\na sustainable planet”, which powerfully encapsulates \r\nthe challenges that we are facing today. In confronting \r\nnumerous crises, hotspots and the terrible human \r\ntragedies that they leave in their wake, we can only \r\nquestion our collective conscience over the deep-rooted \r\ncauses that have led to the failure of the collective security \r\nsystem that was designed by the founding fathers of our \r\nOrganization as a fortress that would forever protect \r\nfuture generations from the scourge of war. We must \r\ntherefore work in unison to reform the Organization so \r\nthat it can fully shoulder the responsibilities that it was \r\nestablished to assume, whether in terms of preventing \r\nconflict, promoting peace or respecting human rights, \r\nor in realizing the right to self-determination.\r\nThe time has come to implement a fundamental \r\nreform for the Organization, including its structure \r\nand management, and, in the reform process, we must \r\nprimarily focus on the Security Council as a starting \r\npoint. We must remedy the historical injustice embodied \r\nin the absence of African representation in both \r\ncategories of membership of that organ. Membership \r\nmust be expanded so that it represents the important \r\nactors in the international arena.\r\nI believe that there is also growing consensus on \r\nthe need to revitalize and strengthen the authority of \r\nthe General Assembly, which for the first time has \r\ninteracted directly and innovatively in the process \r\nof the selection and appointment of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, thereby confirming its trust in him and his \r\nlegitimacy to fulfil his mandate. That selection was \r\nunanimous. The appointment of Mr. Guterres, whose \r\npersonal and professional characteristics we admire, \r\nwas unanimous, which confirms the appropriateness of \r\nthe new procedure.\r\nAlgeria remains committed to certain basic foreign-\r\npolicy principles that are derived from the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, namely, respect for the independence \r\nand territorial integrity of States, non-intervention in \r\nother countries’ internal affairs, the peaceful settlement \r\nof conflicts and the right to self-determination. Algeria \r\nwill continue to act in accordance with those principles \r\nand will always support political rather than military \r\nsolutions in the settlement of conflicts, be they in Syria, \r\nYemen, Mali, Libya or elsewhere.\r\nWith regard to two of its neighbours, Algeria is \r\nconvinced that the people of Mali must choose dialogue \r\nand negotiations if the country is to overcome the \r\ndifficulties that lie in the path of implementing the \r\nAgreement on Peace and Reconciliation in Mali. In \r\norder for Libyans to preserve their unity and territorial \r\nintegrity, it is crucial that they settle their differences \r\nunder the supervision of the Special Representative of \r\nthe Secretary-General, with the support of neighbouring \r\ncountries. On the other hand, we in Algeria believe that \r\nthe Western Sahara issue is a matter of decolonization, \r\nwhich falls within the purview of the United Nations. \r\nAccordingly, we believe that there can be no viable \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 19/28\r\nsolution if the people of Western Sahara are not able \r\nto exercise their legitimate right to self-determination. \r\nIn that regard, Algeria hopes that the appointment of \r\nMr. Horst Köhler as United Nations Personal Envoy for \r\nWestern Sahara will help to bring about the resumption \r\nof negotiations between the two sides to the conflict, \r\nnamely, the Kingdom of Morocco and Frente Polisario, \r\nand assist in moving the country along the path towards \r\ndecolonization, in accordance with the principles of \r\ninternational legitimacy and the relevant Security \r\nCouncil resolutions. \r\nAlgeria would like once again to express its regret \r\nover the inability of the international community to \r\nput an end to Israel’s occupation of Arab territories. \r\nWe reiterate our support for the Palestinian people as \r\nthey strive to regain their legitimate national rights and \r\nestablish their independent State with Al-Quds as its \r\ncapital.\r\nCombating terrorism and violent extremism, \r\nwhich is a source of terrorism, unfortunately remains a \r\npriority on the international agenda. The terrorist threat \r\nhas been far-reaching in nature and continues to be so. \r\nWe are reminded of that fact by the tragedies caused \r\nby the numerous terrorist attacks in the Middle East \r\nand Sahel regions, not to mention the long list of such \r\nattacks perpetrated this year in other parts of the world. \r\nExtremism is spreading at an ever-faster rate owing to \r\nthe emergence of the Internet and social networking \r\nsites. The Organization’s strategy for combating violent \r\nextremism must therefore take that reality into account. \r\nIt must also prompt countries to combat the spread of \r\nIslamophobia at the individual and collective levels. \r\nWe also note that the repatriation of foreign \r\nterrorist fighters requires the international community \r\nto mobilize greater efforts to counter the dangerous \r\nthreats that they bring back to their countries of origin. \r\nAlgeria is fully aware of the dangers of terrorism and \r\ntransborder organized crime in its immediate vicinity. \r\nAlgeria maintains the highest degree of caution \r\ninternally and on its borders, thereby enhancing its \r\ncommitment to combating those phenomena at the \r\nregional and international levels.\r\nAlgeria’s experiences have been recorded in \r\ntwo published collections, one of which pertains to \r\ndemocracy and the role of national reconciliation \r\nin combating terrorism and violent extremism. The \r\nevolving nature of migration, be it legal or illegal, will \r\ninevitably offer opportunities to benefit our economies \r\nand societies. However, some forms of migration cause \r\nextreme harm to those involved, as well as to the \r\ncountries connected with the phenomenon. \r\nBy virtue of its geographical location, Algeria is at \r\nthe forefront in dealing with unregulated migration. In \r\nthe past, Algeria was a country of origin and a transit \r\ncountry, but today Algeria is a destination country \r\nfor such human flows. As a result, it understands \r\nthe complex nature of the issue. We believe that it \r\nis important to continue to work together to find \r\ncomprehensive, integrated and balanced solutions \r\nbased on a fair division of responsibilities, with a \r\nview to preserving the dignity of those who have been \r\nforced by fear or poverty to take the dangerous road of \r\nmigration, exposing themselves to the risk of abuse by \r\norganized transborder criminal gangs. \r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nthe Addis Ababa Action Agenda of the third International \r\nConference on Financing for Development have offered \r\nsome important gains, and we must mobilize all ways \r\nand means to fulfil and preserve them. We believe that \r\nwe have an excellent tool in our hands, namely, the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme and related \r\nentities, for helping developing States to formulate \r\npolicy and undertake domestic development efforts. \r\nBefore I conclude, I would like to inform the \r\nGeneral Assembly of some of the domestic activities \r\nthat Algeria has been undertaking. \r\nPursuant to the directives of the President of the \r\nRepublic, in July 2016 we adopted a new development \r\nplan that aims to expand our emerging national economy \r\nwith an eye on the 2030 horizon. The plan involves the \r\nrational management of financial resources so that \r\nthe gains achieved through social justice and national \r\ncohesion may be preserved. In that regard, Algeria \r\nhas committed itself to implementing Agenda 2030 by \r\nmobilizing national efforts and taking advantage of the \r\ncapacities of all partners, including civil society. Those \r\nefforts, which involve all sectors, seek to diversify the \r\nnational economy and achieve sustainable development.\r\nHaving realized the need to enhance the rights \r\nand independence of women and in the light of the \r\nattention that the United Nations gives to those issues, \r\nI would like to reiterate Algeria’s commitment to the \r\nsubject of women’s rights. The Algerian Constitution \r\nwas amended in 2016 to enshrine that deliberate \r\napproach, and that has been reflected in the improved \r\nsituation of women in rural areas, in local councils, \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n20/28 17-29716\r\nin both chambers of Parliament, as well as in the top \r\npositions in the State. That won Algeria an award from \r\nthe African Union in 2016, as part of its Human Rights \r\nDecade. Algeria received another award in 2017 in the \r\narea of enhancing the rights of women. \r\nYouth constitute three quarters of the population \r\nand are considered another major priority of the \r\nAlgerian State, which, in a constitutional amendment, \r\nestablished a High Council for Youth. Moreover, Algeria \r\nhas for years been working hard to take advantage \r\nof that important human resource, which is of such \r\nsocioeconomic importance. The educational sector \r\nhas also witnessed important efforts by Government \r\nauthorities to offer education to youth, that important \r\npart of society. \r\nAlgeria has been ranked third in Africa and first in \r\nthe Maghreb area in human development. \r\nIt is also worth mentioning that in August Gallup \r\nInc., an international institute for opinion polls, ranked \r\nAlgeria sixth on its list of safest countries in the world.\r\nThose are the points that I wanted to leave with \r\nthe membership on behalf of Algeria as we commence \r\nour work at the seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Amina Chawahir Mohamed, Cabinet Secretary for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Trade of the Republic \r\nof Kenya.\r\nMs. Mohamed (Kenya): I am delighted to address \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nI convey to all warm greetings and best wishes from \r\nthe President of the Republic of Kenya, His Excellency \r\nMr. Uhuru Kenyatta, whom I have the honour to \r\nrepresent here today. The President is committed to the \r\nagenda of this session and its overall objectives.\r\nI congratulate the President on his election to \r\npreside over the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession. I also congratulate His Excellency Mr. António \r\nGuterres on his participation for the first time in the \r\nGeneral Assembly as Secretary-General. I would say \r\nto him that I am encouraged by his commitment to \r\nempower the world’s women and girls, because, as he \r\nsaid, \r\n“Parity at the United Nations will improve \r\nperformance at the United Nations”. (A/72/PV.1, \r\np.3)\r\nHe can count on Kenya’s support for that \r\ncommitment.\r\nThe world faces enormous challenges ranging from \r\npoverty, global terrorism, climate change, conflicts and \r\ninequality, to the unfolding threats to the liberal order \r\nthat have governed the world in the post-war era. At \r\nstake in all those challenges is the well-being of the \r\npeople, the vast majority of whom are suffering the \r\nbrunt of those challenges and whose livelihoods are \r\nbecoming increasingly uncertain. Describing the state \r\nof the world at the time of the Industrial Revolution, the \r\nEnglish writer Charles Dickens said: “It was the best of \r\ntimes, it was the worst of times.” That is still an apt way \r\nof describing the state of the world today with all of its \r\nchallenges and opportunities.\r\nKenya welcomes the theme of the seventy-second \r\nsession, “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and \r\na decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. Kenya \r\nagrees with and supports the priorities for action that \r\nthe President has outlined to guide the focus on people, \r\nnamely, peace and conflict prevention; migration; the \r\nSustainable Development Goals; climate action; and \r\nhuman rights. Those priorities are urgent and deserve \r\nthe attention not only of Governments but also of the \r\nprivate sector and civil society. Kenya acknowledges \r\nthe importance of the Sustainable Development Goals as \r\nan appropriate response to the pressing challenges that \r\nwe face today. We played a key role in the formulation \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals as co-Chair of \r\nthe Open Working Group, and we remain committed \r\nto translating that transformative agenda into tangible \r\naction for our people without leaving any one behind.\r\nHowever, we recognize that achieving the \r\nSustainable Development Goals will be as much about \r\nthe effectiveness of development cooperation as it will \r\nbe about the scale and form such cooperation actually \r\ntakes. There is a lot of talk about partnerships today, \r\nbut not enough of the practical, on-the-ground support \r\nneeded to make partnerships effective in practice. As \r\na country, we have stepped up efforts to achieve the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. In the health sector, \r\nfor example, our Government now offers free maternal \r\nhealth-care services across our country. We next intend \r\nto cover health-care services for women, children and \r\nadolescents. Confirming that commitment two years \r\nago, President Kenyatta said: \r\n“I pledge to take the needed sustainable actions to \r\nend all preventable deaths of women, children and \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 21/28\r\nadolescents within a generation and ensure their \r\nwell-being, and we hold ourselves accountable for \r\nour collective progress towards that goal.” \r\nTogether with the United Nations family in Kenya, \r\nwe have also established a Sustainable Development \r\nGoal partnership platform that seeks to accelerate the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals in \r\nKenya. The platform brings together the Government, \r\ndevelopment partners, the private sector, civil society \r\nand the United Nations. The platform has created \r\ndiverse Sustainable Development Goal accelerator \r\nwindows, of which primary health care has been \r\nthe first. That partnership has resulted in a drastic \r\nreduction in maternal and child deaths. We intend to \r\ntransform primary care to pave the way for universal \r\nhealth coverage for all of 46 million Kenyans by 2021, \r\nthereby ensuring, as we pledged, that no one is left \r\nbehind.\r\nClimate change in our region is disrupting the \r\nlivelihoods of millions of people and generating \r\nconflicts over dwindling resources, especially land and \r\nwater. Climate change today costs Kenya’s economy \r\napproximately 3 per cent in gross domestic product \r\nannually. Kenya has enacted legislation to implement \r\nthe Paris Agreement in order to address that problem. \r\nWe have committed to a 30 per cent reduction in \r\ngreenhouse-gas emissions by 2030, relative to the \r\nbusiness-as-usual scenario, and subject to the necessary \r\nfinancing, technology transfer and capacity-building, \r\nas agreed in Paris. The capacity of our planet to sustain \r\nlife is under threat, and the need to address climate \r\nchange is not a choice; it is an urgent imperative.\r\nWe commend the United Nations for the steps \r\nthat have been taken to strengthen and upgrade the \r\nUnited Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) in \r\naccordance with the Rio +20 Declaration. We welcome \r\nthe step towards universal membership and the efforts to \r\nenhance the financing and ability of UNEP to fulfil its \r\nunique coordination mandate within the United Nations \r\nsystem. I am happy to say that, since its establishment, \r\nthe United Nations Environment Assembly has helped \r\nthe world refocus on the environment. Through the \r\nwork of the Assembly, which is now the de facto \r\nworld parliament for the environment, decisions that \r\ncontribute to the well-being of our planet are now being \r\nuniversally respected.\r\nI call upon the States Members of the United \r\nNations to strengthen UNEP so that it can effectively \r\nrespond to global environmental challenges. In that \r\nregard, Kenya insists on the implementation of the \r\ndecision by Heads of State, now enshrined in the Rio \r\nDeclaration, to consolidate the headquarters functions \r\nof UNEP in Nairobi at its headquarters in Kenya. That \r\nmatter is of grave concern and continues not to receive \r\nthe attention it deserves. The importance of having \r\nUNEP in Kenya, which lies in the global South, cannot \r\nbe overemphasized.\r\nKenya welcomes the creation of the United Nations \r\nOffice of Counter-Terrorism and looks forward to \r\nrobust and productive engagement with it. We expect \r\nthe Office to support all other United Nations bodies \r\nin developing initiatives that are responsive to the \r\nefforts of Member States. Our priorities are targeted \r\ncounter-engagement in radicalization clusters, the \r\ndisengagement of defectors, strengthening intelligence \r\nand law enforcement, and deploying whole-of-\r\nGovernment approaches and socioeconomic tools in \r\nline with a global strategy.\r\nMy delegation supports the Secretary-General’s \r\ncommitment to the reform agenda of the United Nations. \r\nThe United Nations must embrace reforms in order \r\nto adjust to the global landscape of the twenty-first \r\ncentury and be more accommodative, more democratic \r\nand more effective in order to be fit for purpose for our \r\nmodern world. Of particular concern to Africa is the \r\nfact that the Security Council continues to be dominated \r\nby a small club of countries, which totally excludes \r\nthe rest of us. That exclusion continues to undermine \r\nthe legitimacy and efficiency of the Security Council, \r\nwhile its operations, on the other hand, raise issues \r\nof accountability and transparency. Therefore, it is \r\nimperative that the United Nations embrace reforms on \r\nall of the five core areas that have been identified. We \r\ncall for Africa’s representation in both the permanent \r\nand non-permanent categories of the Security Council, \r\nas stated in the African Common Position.\r\nEarly in September, we held a high-level meeting to \r\ndiscuss best practices in relation to implementation of the \r\nNew Urban Agenda, as well as measures to enhance the \r\neffectiveness, efficiency, accountability and financial \r\ncapability of the United Nations Human Settlements \r\nProgramme (UN-HABITAT). At the meeting, Member \r\nStates committed to engaging in the UN-HABITAT \r\nprocess. They called for better coordination of urban \r\nmatters across the entire United Nations system and for \r\nan urban assembly to replace the 58-member Governing \r\nCouncil at its headquarters in Nairobi. We welcome \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n22/28 17-29716\r\nthe confidence that the membership has expressed in \r\nour country.\r\nIt is no secret that UN-HABITAT is among the least-\r\nfunded agencies of the United Nations. The Assembly \r\nneeds an adequate budget in order to enable it to \r\neffectively carry out its mandate. Kenya looks forward \r\nto engaging constructively in the follow-up discussions \r\nin the Second Committee during the current session of \r\nthe General Assembly.\r\nKenya has played a prominent role in the search \r\nfor peace and security in various countries, especially \r\nin Somalia and South Sudan. Thanks to our collective \r\nefforts as an international community, tremendous \r\nprogress has been made in Somalia. In particular, \r\nthe credible elections that took place last year and \r\nthe formation of a broad-based Government marked \r\na watershed moment that laid the foundation for a \r\nstable, democratic transition in Somalia. In order to \r\nconsolidate the gains already made and prevent a relapse \r\ninto conflict, we support the strengthening of the \r\nAfrican Union Military Observer Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM). We also welcome Security Council \r\nresolution 2372 (2017), which extends AMISOM with \r\nrevised core tasks.\r\nWe urge the United Nations to give greater support to \r\nthe Mission, particularly in terms of sustained funding, \r\nin order to enable it to deal with major security threats \r\nahead of the envisaged troop drawdown. Furthermore, \r\nwe strongly believe that support of the reconstruction \r\nprocess, including enabling the Government to provide \r\nbasic services, will improve confidence and help \r\nprevent conflict in Somalia in the future.\r\nMeanwhile, the humanitarian situation in South \r\nSudan remains of concern and needs urgent attention. \r\nWe urge the international community to provide much-\r\nneeded resources in order to help save lives that are \r\nbeing ravaged by famine. It is our expectation that the \r\nGovernment of South Sudan will ensure the protection \r\nof civilians and humanitarian workers. We also call \r\non the international community to support the efforts \r\nof the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \r\nrevitalization process to re-energize the peace process \r\nby bringing together all parties to the conflict.\r\nWe also remain concerned about the situations in \r\nLibya, the Central African Republic, Syria and Iraq. \r\nWe urge the international community to continue \r\nworking diligently to ease the challenges that those \r\nsisterly nations face. In the same vein, we support the \r\nSecretary-General’s continued efforts to find a lasting \r\nsolution for the Palestinian people, based on a two-\r\nState solution.\r\nSince the 1960s, Kenya has hosted huge numbers \r\nof refugees from neighbouring countries. We have \r\nbeen generous hosts, but lately the presence of refugees \r\nhas brought attendant challenges. Those challenges \r\ninclude smuggling, banditry, human trafficking and \r\nthe infiltration of refugee camps by terrorists. In the \r\nlight of those challenges, the Kenyan Government, \r\ntogether with the Somali Federal Government and \r\nthe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees \r\n(UNHCR), and without abdicating its responsibility for \r\nrefugees, signed a tripartite agreement on the voluntary \r\nrepatriation of refugees in 2013. Although it has been \r\nmoving slowly, the repatriation process has since been \r\nconducted in conformity with international obligations. \r\nWe expect the international community to join hands \r\nwith us in supporting the initiative, as it will enable \r\nrefugees to rebuild their lives and regain their human \r\ndignity, away from the squalor of refugee camps.\r\nKenya welcomes the President’s decision to \r\nconvene a high-level meeting of the General Assembly \r\non the appraisal of the United Nations Global Plan \r\nof Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons. As \r\na country, we enacted the Counter Trafficking in \r\nPersons Act in 2010, which domesticated the United \r\nNations Convention against Transnational Organized \r\nCrime, including its Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and \r\nPunish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and \r\nChildren. That high-level meeting will provide a much-\r\nneeded, integrated global platform to increase public \r\nawareness, share good practices and address loopholes \r\nthat aid slavery and trafficking, including ensuring \r\neffective border management, capacity-building for \r\nimmigration officers and the efficient monitoring of \r\nlocal and international employment agencies.\r\nKenya welcomes the historic adoption on 7 July \r\nof the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nAlthough nuclear-weapon States are absent, the \r\noverwhelming majority of Member States support the \r\nTreaty. That demonstrates our concerns about the danger \r\nthat the use of such weapons poses to humankind, about \r\nwhich we were all reminded by the unfortunate nuclear \r\ndetonation that took place on 3 September. The adoption \r\nof the Treaty gives us renewed hope that it is possible, if \r\nwe work together, to rid the world of nuclear weapons.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 23/28\r\nFinally, Kenya is a firm believer in multilateralism. \r\nWe acknowledge the remarkable role that the United \r\nNations has played in sustaining peace in our world \r\nand in providing a global platform for cooperation and \r\nsolidarity among nations. We know that the United \r\nNations can do better. We believe that the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and the Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment have given the United Nations a blueprint \r\nfor creating greater peace in our world and for making \r\nglobalization and development fair and equitable for \r\nall. That is the future that we want for ourselves and for \r\nfuture generations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Gudlaugur Thór Thórdarson, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Iceland.\r\nMr. Thórdarson (Iceland): We live in a world of \r\nopportunity. Never have we had such potential to end \r\npoverty, hunger and violations of human rights, and \r\nfocus on people striving for a decent life. We can either \r\nsucceed or we can fail. It is a choice; it is a decision. \r\nIt is our responsibility and it is our task. This task is \r\nnot just about numbers or statistics, but real-life people. \r\nThere is purpose and worth to each and every life. Let \r\nus not forget.\r\nOur task is not easy. But the most important things \r\nin life are never easy. The right path is always difficult, \r\nand we definitely face difficulties. The consequences of \r\nclimate change, bad governance, terrorism and conflict \r\nhave made our world seem more dangerous, less \r\npredictable and more chaotic, as our Secretary-General \r\nhas put it. It is our common responsibility to safeguard \r\nthe progress we have made since the establishment of \r\nthis institution and to make good on our promises of \r\nprosperity for all.\r\nThe world’s economic and social progress has, in \r\nlarge part, been driven by science and rational action, \r\nbased on evidence. We must hold firm to that approach. \r\nOnly policy, grounded in facts and evidence, can help \r\nus deal with such common threats as climate change and \r\ncreate a world that truly reflects our values. The Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change and the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development provide the blueprints for \r\nour success. Now we must deliver. Droughts, sea-level \r\nrise, ocean acidification and other consequences of \r\nclimate change have wide-ranging implications for all \r\nour communities. Climate change is nowhere as visible \r\nas in the Arctic, with far-reaching consequences in the \r\nother parts of the world. The melting of the polar ice in \r\nthe North causes higher sea levels in the South. What \r\nhappens in the Arctic does not stay in the Arctic. In \r\nfulfilling our Paris Agreement obligations, we aim to \r\nreduce emissions by 40 per cent by 2030 collectively \r\nwith our European countries. Iceland remains \r\ncommitted to that goal.\r\nSince the establishment of this institution, a \r\nrule-based international order has been the foundation \r\nfor peace and prosperity. The assault on the rule of law \r\nby certain Governments undermines the stability of the \r\ninternational system. We condemn in the strongest terms \r\nthe illegal actions of North Korean leaders and call on \r\nthem to accept generous offers to return to the negotiating \r\ntable. During the past weeks, we have at last seen a \r\nunited Security Council act firmly but constructively \r\nto push for dialogue and confidence-building measures, \r\nwhile staying firm on strengthening sanctions in the \r\nface of continued provocation.\r\nThe use of chemical weapons by the Syrian \r\nGovernment against its own people was a blatant \r\nviolation of international and humanitarian laws \r\nand demanded a firm response by the international \r\ncommunity. Complex internal conflicts have led to \r\ndisplacement and suffering on a massive scale, with \r\nfamine looming in many areas, including Yemen. \r\nThe issue of Western Sahara remains unresolved with \r\ntensions rising. The disregard for the sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity of Ukraine is another serious \r\nassault on the international rule-based order.\r\nThe Security Council bears primary responsibility \r\nfor maintaining international peace and security. Along \r\nwith several other countries, Iceland has encouraged \r\nthe Security Council to include long-term perspectives \r\nin its mission mandates to lay the foundations for \r\nlasting peace.\r\nThe modern era has also seen the rise of non-State \r\nactors — something our system did not plan for. \r\nTerrorists have sought to undermine trust and tolerance \r\nwithin and among our communities. Alongside \r\nimprovements of the United Nations anti-terrorism \r\nmechanism, we must identify the drivers of violent \r\nextremism and terrorism. At the heart of conflict and \r\nviolent extremism lies a failure of development. That is \r\nwhere the 2030 Agenda must play a vital role.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda is indeed a remarkable \r\nachievement. It is grounded in the Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights as human rights, peace \r\nand development are inseparable and essential to \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n24/28 17-29716\r\nthe successful implementation of the Agenda. I take \r\nvery seriously the Secretary-General’s warning that \r\ndisregard for human rights is a disease, and it is a \r\ndisease that is spreading — north, south, east and west.\r\nThe violation of freedom of expression, of rights to \r\nfree assembly, of the fundamental rights of women — all \r\nundermine the 2030 Agenda. Extrajudicial killings, \r\nrepression of minorities and the denial of the right to \r\nlegitimate opposition set back sustainable development, \r\nsometimes by generations. Here I would like to express \r\ndeep concern at the completely unacceptable situation \r\nof the Rohingya population in Myanmar.\r\nIceland knows first-hand the massive potential \r\nthat lies in gender equality. With UN-Women as a key \r\npartner, Iceland is a dedicated proponent of women’s \r\nhuman rights. We actively work to engage men in \r\nthe fight for gender equality and, indeed, our Prime \r\nMinister is a HeForShe IMPACT Champion. We support \r\nthe United Nations Population Fund and the SheDecides \r\ninitiative for sexual and reproductive health and rights, \r\nand continue to promote women’s participation in the \r\npeace and security agenda.\r\nI commend the Secretary-General for his commitment \r\nto gender equality within the United Nations and \r\nhis determination in addressing the issue of sexual \r\nexploitation and abuse by peacekeepers and United \r\nNations staff — a betrayal of the civilians under their \r\ncare and of the values of the United Nations.\r\nAt the beginning of the twentieth century, Iceland \r\nwas one the poorest countries in western Europe. \r\nNow, we are one of the richest. Why? The answer to \r\nthat question is the key to our approach to the task at \r\nhand of delivering for the people of this world who are \r\nstriving for a decent life, and making sure that everyone \r\ncan benefit from this world of ours — the world of \r\nopportunities. Iceland’s path from rags to riches is a \r\ntextbook example of the power of free trade. We gained \r\naccess to large foreign markets where we could sell our \r\nproducts, and by doing so we changed our fortunes.\r\nEvery year, we gather here in the capital of free \r\ntrade and talk about the importance of ending poverty \r\nin the world. We can talk the talk, but can we really \r\nwalk the walk? We can really do something about \r\nthis. We can open our markets. We can let the poorer \r\ncountries trade freely with our consumers. Let us trade, \r\nand let us keep in mind that free trade is not only the \r\nexchange of goods or services for money. Free trade is \r\nforming relationships. Free trade is people interacting, \r\ntravelling and understanding each other, regardless of \r\ncolour or religion. Free trade is the most powerful tool \r\nto establish and maintain peace.\r\nWhile the markets of the richest countries in the \r\nworld remain closed to the poorest countries, it is truly \r\nour obligation to provide development assistance. A \r\nlarge share of Iceland’s bilateral assistance goes to the \r\nleast developed countries, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. \r\nWe focus on our areas of expertise, such as energy and \r\nfisheries, while at the same time ensuring a horizontal \r\nemphasis on human rights and gender equality.\r\nTo share our knowledge and experience, Iceland \r\nhosts United Nations University (UNU) programmes \r\non fisheries management, geothermal energy and land \r\nrestoration, in addition to its UNU gender programme. \r\nThrough projects and partnerships with the International \r\nRenewable Energy Agency, Sustainable Energy for \r\nAll and the World Bank, Iceland works actively to \r\nincrease the utilization of sustainable geothermal \r\nenergy. We also support the work of the United Nations \r\nConvention to Combat Desertification and the Food \r\nand Agriculture Organization of the United Nations \r\nto increase food security and mitigate climate change \r\nthrough land restoration.\r\nContinuing a tradition of leadership in oceans \r\naffairs, Iceland actively contributed to the United \r\nNations Ocean Conference earlier this year. Our \r\nmany commitments include reducing marine litter and \r\nplastics in the ocean, an issue on which Governments, \r\nbusinesses and individuals must cooperate. Allow me \r\nto welcome the Secretary-General’s appointment of \r\nMr. Peter Thomson as his Special Envoy for the Ocean. \r\nWe look forward to working with Mr. Thomson.\r\nUnlocking the transformative potential of people \r\nand the private sector is key to success. In financing \r\nfor development, we must be clear that development \r\ncooperation, while vital, is only a small part of what is \r\nneeded. Good governance, strong institutions, human \r\nrights and equal opportunities are essential to inclusive \r\neconomic progress, which eventually depends on the \r\npolitical will of leaders. Creating an environment in \r\nwhich doing business is easy and investment makes \r\nsense is key to growth.\r\nIceland strongly believes in the potential of \r\nglobalization and international trade as an engine for \r\neconomic growth and poverty reduction. We must \r\ncontinue to promote a universal, rules-based, fair, \r\nmultilateral trading system under the World Trade \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 25/28\r\nOrganization. At the same time, we must be aware of \r\nthe measures necessary to enable the least developed \r\ncountries to participate on fair terms. If we are to \r\nachieve the Sustainable Development Goals, this is not \r\nthe time to erect trade barriers.\r\nThe dire situation of the 65 million people driven \r\nfrom their homes by conflict, economic hardship and \r\nclimate change urgently requires a solution. How we, \r\nas an international community, address migration will \r\ndefine us for future generations. The forthcoming \r\nprocess towards global compacts for refugees and \r\nfor safe, orderly and regular migration will give us \r\nthe opportunity to establish new and comprehensive \r\napproaches to that current challenge. Those approaches \r\nmust be grounded in humanitarian law and respect \r\nfor the human rights and fundamental freedoms of all \r\nmigrants, especially children. As host communities, we \r\nshould not forget the positive contribution that migrants \r\ncan make to growth and sustainable development.\r\nIceland has received an ever-increasing number of \r\nrefugees, in addition to providing generous assistance \r\nto United Nations agencies working in the countries \r\nthat neighbour Syria. We will continue to do our part. \r\nOur forefathers, scarred by the Second World War and \r\neconomic depression, had the foresight to set up the \r\nUnited Nations and the Bretton Woods Institutions.\r\nJust as this great building was renovated so \r\nsuccessfully a few years ago, so too must the United \r\nNations to be made fit for purpose in the modern era. \r\nWe strongly support the work of the Secretary-General \r\nin management reform, development reform and his \r\nsustaining peace agenda.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Margot Wallström, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Sweden.\r\nMs. Wallström (Sweden): In 1954, former \r\nSecretary-General Dag Hammarskjöld stated that the \r\nUnited Nations was not created to bring us to heaven, \r\nbut to save us from hell. The need for a United Nations \r\nthat seeks to save us from humankind’s worst impulses \r\nremains. However, in these days of uncertainty, we \r\nmust also learn from and build on what is positive in \r\nour world and the United Nations.\r\nIn his important address on Tuesday (see \r\nA/72/PV.3), our Secretary-General laid out the threats \r\nand challenges that we face and how we can overcome \r\nthem. Delivering a peaceful and prosperous future \r\nwill depend on collective action. This is the moment \r\nfor multilateralism, not unilateralism. We must grasp \r\nit or risk the consequences. The United Nations is at \r\nthe centre of that effort. It is a tailor-made space for the \r\nworld to find solutions to the common challenges of \r\nour time. Despite the sometimes justified criticisms, it \r\nis clear that we still believe in the power of the United \r\nNations. If we did not, Presidents, Prime Ministers and \r\nbusiness and civil-society leaders would not be here \r\nthis week. I believe that we all recognize that, in the \r\nface of global challenges, going it alone is no longer \r\nan option.\r\nThe United Nations, founded to save succeeding \r\ngenerations from the scourge of war and to promote \r\nbetter standards of life in larger freedom, has prevented \r\na repetition of the catastrophic wars that preceded its \r\nfounding. Extreme poverty has fallen to a historic \r\nlow. Life expectancy continues to climb. Millions \r\nof people are reached every year with life-saving \r\nhumanitarian assistance.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change and the sustaining \r\npeace agenda are powerful illustrations of what we can \r\nachieve together. Those agreements are the strategies \r\nfor our common future. We must now ensure that the \r\nOrganization has the structure and the tools needed to \r\nsupport countries to deliver them. The broad support \r\nfor the Secretary-General’s reform agenda illustrates \r\nthe importance that we attach to an effective United \r\nNations, its role at the centre of multilateralism and as a \r\nplatform for the delivery of our common commitments. \r\nThe scope of the reforms being proposed by the \r\nSecretary-General and the Deputy Secretary-General \r\nreveals the complex tasks at hand.\r\nThe peace and security architecture must better \r\nprevent conflicts and sustain peace. The United Nations \r\ndevelopment system must be radically reoriented to \r\nachieve the 2030 Agenda. Moreover, to deliver those \r\nchanges, modern management skills and systems will \r\nbe essential. More importantly, we must recognize that \r\nthose reforms cannot be pursued in isolation from one \r\nanother. People do not experience life in pieces — their \r\nneeds must be central. Peace and security, economic \r\nand social development and the protection and \r\npromotion of human rights are mutually reinforcing. \r\nAs a response, all pillars of the United Nations system \r\nand our own bilateral efforts must also be interlinked \r\nand mutually reinforcing. That calls for new ways of \r\nworking and thinking.\r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n26/28 17-29716\r\nSweden fully subscribes to the principles for reform \r\nthat were articulated by the Secretary-General: a country-\r\nlevel and people-centred perspective, gender parity, \r\ndecentralized responsibility and decision-making, \r\nand reformed budget procedures. Secretary-General \r\nGuterres and Deputy Secretary-General Mohammed \r\nhave our full support in their efforts.\r\nOn our part, we, as Member States, have a \r\nresponsibility to act coherently, avoid micromanagement \r\nand ensure long-term, stable and adequate financing. \r\nMore f lexible funding is necessary. We firmly believe \r\nin core and unearmarked funding. We cannot allow \r\nourselves to cherry pick to accommodate domestic \r\ninterests; that will not give the Organization the \r\nstability it needs.\r\nI am proud to say that Sweden will increase its \r\ndevelopment cooperation budget by approximately \r\n$350 million in 2018, bringing our budget to its \r\nhighest-ever level and delivering on our commitment \r\nto devote 1 per cent of gross national income to official \r\ndevelopment assistance. In addition to words, we will \r\nsupport the Secretary-General’s efforts with kronor by \r\nmaking available additional f lexible funding for reform.\r\nIn the immediate term, faced with record levels of \r\nhumanitarian need, the humanitarian system requires \r\nurgent funding to save lives and end suffering. In the \r\nlonger term, investing in the 2030 Agenda and the \r\nsustaining peace agenda will build resilience.\r\nLet me focus now on three particular areas in the \r\nremainder of my remarks.\r\nFirst, nine months ago, Sweden joined the Security \r\nCouncil. As the General Assembly elected us to the \r\nCouncil, it is only proper that I report back to its \r\nmembers on what we have been doing on their behalf. \r\nOur approach to the Council is simple. While we each \r\ncome with our own national perspective and will \r\nnot always agree, as Council members we are bound \r\ntogether by a responsibility to the Charter of the United \r\nNations and the world.\r\nTo that end, Sweden works with all members \r\nto deliver meaningful outcomes from the Council’s \r\ndiscussions. We work closely with the other elected \r\nmembers, which represent the broader membership \r\nand bring important perspectives. We are also talking \r\nwith many members of the Assembly as part of our \r\ncommitment to speaking with countries on the Council’s \r\nagenda, not only about them.\r\nDelivering real outcomes for those who need them is \r\na responsibility that goes beyond our national interests. \r\nNeeds are growing. The number of major conflicts is \r\non the rise. However, as the Secretary-General has said, \r\nneither war nor peace is inevitable; they result from \r\nthe choices that we make. Many of the conflicts on \r\nthe Council’s agenda have come about not because we \r\nfailed to see them coming — the signs were there — but \r\nbecause we failed to respond early or quickly enough.\r\nMoreover, prevention means not only choosing \r\nto heed the warnings when they come, but investing \r\nin peaceful societies to avoid the causes of conflicts \r\nemerging in the first place. As leaders within our \r\ncommunities and as national leaders, we must choose \r\npeace, invest in peace and deliver peace. The United \r\nNations system must be configured to support us.\r\nSweden has made conflict prevention a central \r\npillar of our Council membership. We have underscored \r\nthe need for the Council to recognize the primacy \r\nof politics in peacekeeping mandates and the need \r\nfor long-term political strategies that aim to prevent \r\nconflict and sustain peace by addressing root causes. I \r\nbelieve we are making progress. That is evidenced by \r\nthe Council’s support for a peaceful resolution of the \r\ncrisis in the Gambia, for the peace process in Colombia \r\nand for the transitions in Liberia and Côte d’Ivoire, \r\nas well as its cooperation with the African Union to \r\nbring stability to Somalia. As Chair of the Council’s \r\nWorking Group on Children and Armed Conflict, \r\nSweden has sought to strengthen the protection of \r\nchildren in conflict zones. The protection of children \r\ntoday prevents conflicts tomorrow.\r\nNonetheless, we have to do more. The situation in \r\nMyanmar is a haunting example of where the root causes \r\nof conflict went unresolved, with tragic consequences. \r\nIt is now urgent that the violence end and that the \r\npopulation be protected, human rights respected and \r\na dignified return allowed. Humanitarian access is \r\nessential. Sweden supports the recommendations \r\nof the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State. We \r\nurge the Myanmar Government to implement those \r\nrecommendations without delay.\r\nIn Syria, prevention also failed. The price paid \r\nby the country and its citizens has been unimaginable \r\nand horrific. Sweden will continue to work through \r\nthe Council for nationwide humanitarian access and \r\na political solution, which is the only option for long-\r\nterm peace and a better future for Syria.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.16\r\n17-29716 27/28\r\nIn South Sudan, the civilian population has also \r\nborne the brunt of a nearly four-year, devastating \r\nconflict. I welcome the recent initiatives of South \r\nSudan’s neighbours. I urge the Government and all \r\nother parties to increase humanitarian access, lay down \r\ntheir arms and engage in a meaningful process to end \r\nthe conflict.\r\nWe continue our long-standing engagement in \r\ntrying to advance the Middle East peace process. As \r\nthe Secretary-General said during his recent visit to the \r\nregion, the two-State solution is the only way forward. \r\nOnly a negotiated settlement between the parties and an \r\nend to the 50 years of occupation can achieve the goal \r\nof Israel and Palestine living side by side in peace and \r\nsecurity. We need to resolve the conflict once and for \r\nall. Doing so will have implications for peace that go \r\nbeyond the Holy Land and the Middle East itself.\r\nPerhaps the greatest threat to international peace and \r\nsecurity is the unacceptable and repeated provocations \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea in pursuit \r\nof a nuclear-weapons programme. We call upon the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to cease further \r\ntesting, fulfil its international obligations and turn to a \r\npath of sincere dialogue on denuclearization. All States \r\nmust implement the measures that have been decided \r\nupon by a united Security Council. Sanctions must be \r\ncombined with political efforts to pave the way for a \r\npeaceful solution. We welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\npledge to make his good offices available to that end.\r\nLasting peace requires the involvement of the entire \r\npopulation, meaning that the full, equal and effective \r\nparticipation of women must be hardwired into all of \r\nour efforts towards sustaining peace. That brings me \r\nto my second point — women and peace and security.\r\nAs a representative of the world’s first feminist \r\nGovernment, that issue is close to my heart. From \r\nspeaking with many members of the Assembly, I \r\nrealize that I am far from alone in my strong conviction \r\nthat women’s participation in peace and security efforts \r\nis essential for sustainable peace. Ensuring women’s \r\nparticipation must be at the centre of the United Nations \r\nreform efforts.\r\nSweden is working tirelessly to put the women and \r\npeace and security agenda into action in all aspects of \r\nthe Security Council’s work, from including gender \r\nreporting in mission mandates, to adding listing \r\ncriteria for sexual and gender-based violence in \r\nsanctions regimes. Sweden’s feminist foreign policy \r\nis an agenda for change that is aimed at increasing \r\nrights, representation and resources for all women and \r\ngirls, based on the reality of their lives. We urge all \r\ncountries to form their own feminist policy and ensure \r\nthat everyone — women, men, boys and girls — is \r\ntreated equally.\r\nMy third and last point regards our common \r\nresponsibility for global development. The 2030 \r\nAgenda provides the pathways to achieve the peaceful, \r\nsustainable and equitable societies we want. All \r\ncountries — rich and poor — share the responsibility of \r\nturning that promise into a reality for millions of people \r\naround the world. It will not be done by Governments \r\nalone. All stakeholders from across society have a part \r\nto play. Ensuring that the United Nations development \r\nsystem is transformed to support those efforts will \r\nbe critical.\r\nMeasuring our progress against the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) will be essential, both \r\nfor decision-making and accountability. Sweden \r\nhas developed a set of national goals, linked to the \r\nSDGs and our national budget, which we are using \r\nto measure the development of our society. As we \r\nall know, the strength of the 2030 Agenda is in the \r\ninherent interlinkages between all 17 Goals. Each Goal \r\nis equally important and interdependent. Nonetheless, I \r\nwould like to highlight two of those Goals.\r\nFirst, I will address the Goal of reducing inequality. \r\nGlobalization has opened the world, strengthened \r\neconomic growth and lifted hundreds of millions out \r\nof poverty. However, we have failed to allocate the \r\nbenefits of globalization equally. We must do better. As \r\npart of our contribution, in 2016 Sweden, together with \r\nan initial core group of States, businesses and trade \r\nunions, launched the Global Deal for Decent Work and \r\nInclusive Growth. The Global Deal is a partnership \r\ndeveloped with the International Labour Organization \r\nand the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment, with a focus on enhanced social dialogue \r\nand sound industrial relations, which are crucial to \r\nreducing inequality.\r\nThe second Goal I would like to mention is \r\nthat of healthy oceans and seas. Oceans connect us \r\nall. Without water, there is no life. Therefore, the \r\ndeteriorating condition of our oceans must ring alarm \r\nbells for us all. Sweden was pleased to co-host, with \r\nFiji, the Ocean Conference that took place in June. The \r\nmulti-stakeholder participation and all the commitments \r\nA/72/PV.16 22/09/2017\r\n28/28 17-29716\r\nmade highlighted the fact that saving the oceans will \r\nrequire all sectors of society to play their part, and that \r\nthey are ready to do so.\r\nThe oceans are also affected by and, in return, \r\naffect our climate. We are already seeing the \r\ndevastating impact of extreme weather events. Climate \r\nchange will increase the frequency and intensity of \r\nsuch events. Left unchecked, climate change will wash \r\naway development gains and increase instability and \r\nconflict. To the few who still doubt the overwhelming \r\nevidence that climate change is real, I ask: are they \r\nreally willing to take the chance? Especially when \r\nwe see that new technologies offer the opportunity to \r\nsimultaneously reduce emissions and grow economies. \r\nSweden is already proving that is possible and has set a \r\ngoal of zero net greenhouse emissions by 2045.\r\nAll countries must join the effort to achieve the \r\ndecisive transformations needed to reduce emissions \r\nand prevent the worst effects of climate change \r\nfrom happening. With 160 States parties to the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change so far, the global \r\ncommitment remains strong.\r\nIn his address on Tuesday, the Secretary-General \r\ntold us that we must act as one, because only together, \r\nas united nations, can we fulfil the promise of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and advance human \r\ndignity for all. He is right. The expression “we are all \r\nin this together” has perhaps never been so apt. As our \r\nworld becomes more integrated, so do the challenges \r\nand threats we face. We cannot go it alone; we must \r\nstand together. Multilateralism is the only path to peace \r\nand prosperity.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.05 p.m.\r\n"
