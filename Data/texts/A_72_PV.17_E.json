"United Nations A/72/PV.17\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n17th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 22 September 2017, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Brown \r\n(Liberia), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.10 p.m.\r\nAddress by His Majesty King Tupou VI, King of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the King of the Kingdom of Tonga.\r\nKing Tupou VI, King of the Kingdom of Tonga, was \r\nescorted into the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I have the honour to welcome to the \r\nUnited Nations His Majesty King Tupou VI, King of \r\nthe Kingdom of Tonga, and to invite him to address \r\nthe Assembly.\r\nKing Tupou VI: I would like to congratulate \r\nMr. Lajčák on his assumption of the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session and to \r\nassure him that the Tonga delegation will fully support \r\nhis able leadership in revitalizing and enhancing the \r\ncrucial role of the United Nations. I am grateful to \r\nhis predecessor, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\na distinguished son of the Pacific islands region, for \r\nadvancing the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and successfully convening \r\nthe inaugural Ocean Conference this year. I also \r\ncommend His Excellency Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres for his sterling stewardship since he began his \r\nfirst year at the helm of the United Nations. The Tonga \r\ndelegation will fully support his important reform work.\r\nWe send our message of solidarity and sympathy to \r\nthe people of Mexico and to their families and friends \r\naffected by the devastating earthquake, as well as to the \r\nmillions of people in the Caribbean and all those affected \r\nin recent weeks by the ravages of successive hurricanes.\r\nMy delegation and I welcome the timely and \r\nrelevant theme of this year’s session — “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on \r\na sustainable planet”. It essentially emphasizes the \r\npeaceful well-being of all people and the conservation \r\nand sustainable use of our global resources for \r\npresent and future generations. What is now crucial \r\nis implementation, through sincere partnerships, to \r\ncollectively achieve the targets, goals and objectives set \r\nunder international law and the internationally agreed \r\noutcomes. In contributing to the implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, including the internationally agreed \r\nblueprint for the sustainable development of small island \r\ndeveloping States (SIDS) and the SIDS Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway, Tonga has \r\nestablished a national monitoring mechanism, for which \r\nwe would like to acknowledge the support of the United \r\nNations Development Programme (UNDP).\r\nThe United Nations Development Assistance \r\nFramework 2013-2017 will conclude at the end of this \r\nyear. The five-year programme cycle for 14 Pacific island \r\ncountries, the United Nations Pacific Strategy 2018-\r\n2022, which was signed in August 2017 at the UNDP \r\nPacific Office, will commence after that. The close \r\npartnership between the Government of Tonga and the \r\nUnited Nations system for effectively implementing the \r\nintegrated Tonga strategic development framework and \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It is strategically positioned \r\nto provide technical advice to the Government, \r\nnon-governmental organizations, civil society and the \r\nprivate sector.\r\nWe also note the Secretary-General’s new \r\nsenior-management appointments and welcome the \r\nappointment of the first woman from Tonga and \r\nthe Pacific islands region to shepherd the important \r\nadvocacy and facilitation work in the years ahead for the \r\nUnited Nations Office of the High Representative for \r\nthe Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries and Small Island Developing States. We fully \r\nsupport the goal of gender parity, including at all levels \r\nin the Organization.\r\nThe 2017 High-level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment enabled us to review seven of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in particular \r\nGoal 3, on good health and well-being; Goal 5 on gender \r\nequality and the empowerment of women and girls; and \r\nGoal 14 on the ocean and its resources. We commend \r\nthe President of the Economic and Social Council for his \r\ninitiative in devoting adequate time to underscore and \r\nexamine the complex sustainability challenges facing \r\nSIDS, as a special case, and thereby enhancing efforts \r\nto implement the commitments called for in the Samoa \r\nPathway. The High-level Political Forum remains an \r\nimportant way to assess the follow-up, monitoring and \r\naccountability of commitments to SIDS, which are \r\nessentially linked to the 2030 Agenda and the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda.\r\nWe fully support Fiji’s presidency this year of the \r\ntwenty-third Conference of Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, with a view \r\nto strongly addressing the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange and the urgent need for innovation in adaptation \r\nfor SIDS. We note the role of the International Monetary \r\nFund, the World Bank, and the Asian Development \r\nBank in making disaster finance and other financial \r\ntools available to all SIDS. While we acknowledge \r\ntheir work on expanding the definition of fragility, we \r\nurge for further refinement of operational financing \r\ndecisions so as to include the drivers of vulnerability \r\nthat the Pacific islands region experiences, particularly \r\nnatural disasters and adverse economic shocks. We \r\nreiterate our call for the appointment of a special \r\nrepresentative for climate and security to ensure that \r\nthe United Nations system has the appropriate tools to \r\nrespond effectively and efficiently to climate change as \r\nan existential threat and a mounting security challenge \r\nfor SIDS and the entire international community.\r\nEnhanced access to modern and clean \r\nsustainable-energy services, energy efficiency and \r\nthe use of economically viable and environmentally \r\nsound technology and research play a critical role in \r\nour sustainable development. Mitigation efforts are \r\nalso essential to overcoming the challenges of excessive \r\ndependence on imported fossil fuels. To further \r\nstrengthen international and regional cooperation, \r\nthe Pacific Centre for Renewable Energy and Energy \r\nEfficiency was established in Tonga in April. The \r\nCentre provides valuable support to Pacific island \r\ncountries and territories in advancing their various \r\npriorities and commitments in achieving sustainable \r\nenergy and contributing to SDGs 7, 9 and 13. It is a \r\npartnership that includes the Pacific Community, the \r\nGovernment of Austria, the United Nations Industrial \r\nDevelopment Organization and the SIDS Sustainable \r\nEnergy Initiative, among others. The General Assembly \r\nacknowledged the Centre at its adoption in July of the \r\nbiennial resolution entitled “Cooperation between \r\nthe United Nations and the Pacific Islands Forum” \r\n(resolution 71/316).\r\nHowever, we continue to experience the negative \r\neffects of ocean degradation on our livelihoods and \r\nculture, owing to anthropogenic activities and the \r\ndevastating interrelated effects of climate change. We \r\nare already actively contributing to the implementation \r\nof SDG 14, and look forward to a strong collaboration \r\nwith all interested parties. This year we hosted an \r\ninternational whaling meeting. Through a far-sighted \r\nroyal decree in 1978, His Majesty the late King Tupou \r\nIV had already banned whaling in Tongan waters four \r\nyears before the international ban on whale hunting \r\ncame into effect. That was reaffirmed during the April \r\n2017 international conference on “Whales in a changing \r\nocean” that we were honoured to host.\r\nWe may be a small island State, but all small island \r\ndeveloping States are large-ocean States. For us and our \r\npeople, the successful implementation of Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goal 14 is critical to our pathway towards \r\nsustainable development and its interconnection with \r\nother goals, such as those related to food security, \r\nwater and sanitation, health, economic growth, and \r\nsustainable production and consumption. We need \r\nstrong political will for a whole-of-Government \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 3/27\r\napproach to mainstreaming ocean-related actions \r\nfrom international, regional, and national development \r\nplans and strategies, in order to ensure the inclusive \r\nparticipation and efforts of all stakeholders, including \r\nlocal communities and the private sector.\r\nTonga joined the international community in \r\nendorsing the call-for-action outcome document \r\n(resolution 71/312) of the Ocean Conference in June, \r\nwhich includes almost 1,400 voluntary commitments \r\nby stakeholders, including eight from Tonga. It is a \r\nfoundation for the development of a blue economy or \r\n“blue charter”, as proposed by the Commonwealth \r\nsecretariat. It is urgent that we begin working to \r\ndevelop practical guidelines and toolkits to assist States \r\nin delivering on all the targets under Goal 14 in an \r\nintegrated manner.\r\nWe acknowledge the completion of the work of \r\nthe Preparatory Committee established by General \r\nAssembly resolution 69/292 on the development \r\nof a legally binding instrument under the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Tonga \r\nmaintains its support for the commencement of an \r\nintergovernmental conference to initiate negotiations \r\non a substantive text as soon as possible. We embrace \r\nthe ongoing work of the International Seabed Authority \r\nin its administration and management of resources in \r\nthat area in accordance with the common heritage of \r\nmankind. Tonga congratulates the Secretary-General \r\nof the Authority in his first year in office as he works \r\nwith member States to develop important exploitation \r\nregulations, which must strike the appropriate balance \r\nbetween conservation of the natural environment in \r\nwhich mineral resources exist and its sustainable use. \r\nThe consultations must be transparent and inclusive if \r\nsuch a balance is to be achieved.\r\nTonga continues its engagement as a member State \r\nof the Authority and will seek re-election to the Council \r\nat the Authority’s twenty-fourth session in 2018. A \r\nTongan national, together with other members of the \r\nLegal and Technical Commission, provides expert \r\nviews for facilitating the work of the Commission in \r\ndeveloping an important financial mechanism for \r\nensuring the fair and equitable distribution of returns \r\nfrom seabed mining.\r\nTonga reiterates the call made under the Samoa \r\nPathway for genuine and durable partnerships that \r\ncan help to ensure that no one is left behind. A very \r\ncredible partnership mechanism between the 12 Pacific \r\nSIDS and Italy, Austria, Luxembourg and Spain is \r\nexemplified through the Joint Committee. It has been \r\nably co-chaired by Italy and the Chair of the Pacific \r\nSIDS every year since 2006. Tonga has therefore \r\nbenefited thanks to projects related to renewable \r\nenergy, water, the strengthening of young Government \r\nofficials’ capacities and, more recently, protected \r\nmaritime areas.\r\nWe welcome the establishment of the India-United \r\nNations Development Fund through the United Nations \r\nOffice for South-South Cooperation, which launched a \r\nproject implemented by UNDP for establishing early \r\nwarning systems in Tonga and other Pacific island \r\ncountries. The system relies on the timely provision of \r\ndisaster-risk information, guidance on how to act on \r\nwarnings and ensuring a constant state of preparedness. \r\nSustainable development is possible where there is \r\npeace and security, and sustainable development is key \r\nto peace and security.\r\nFinally, we urge all leaders to focus and reflect on \r\nthe best ways to ensure that their power and legitimacy \r\ncan benefit their own people and the entire world. We \r\nappeal for a speedy resolution to the current tensions on \r\nthe Korean peninsula, which are affecting global peace \r\nand security. I congratulate the Secretary-General on \r\nthe recent establishment of the High-level Advisory \r\nBoard for Mediation, designed to advise him on specific \r\ninitiatives and related efforts around the world.\r\nMay Almighty God guide and bless the President \r\nof the General Assembly, all the States Members of \r\nthe United Nations and their respective Governments \r\nand peoples.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the King of the Kingdom of \r\nTonga for the statement he has just made.\r\nHis Majesty King Tupou VI, King of the Kingdom \r\nof Tonga, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n4/27 17-29722\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime \r\nMinister of Solomon Islands\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now hear \r\nan address by the Prime Minister of Solomon Islands.\r\nMr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Manasseh Sogavare, \r\nPrime Minister of Solomon Islands, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Sogavare (Solomon Islands): I would like to add \r\nto those of others the congratulations of my delegation \r\nto Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nHis great experience and wisdom as a diplomat will \r\nguide our work going forward in this session. I assure \r\nhim that for its part, my delegation will try to lighten \r\nhis burden by providing him with full cooperation \r\nthroughout the proceedings of the Assembly.\r\nWith regard to his predecessor, His Excellency \r\nMr. Peter Thomson, what can I say? Not only was \r\nhe the first Fijian to hold the office of President of \r\nthe General Assembly, he was also the first Pacific \r\nislander to assume that prestigious office. Among his \r\nmany achievements was his championing of the 1,350 \r\nvoluntary commitments made at the Ocean Conference \r\nheld here in June. I thank him for a marvellous job done.\r\nOur world is going through difficult times. The year \r\n2017 has been dominated by intentional provocations \r\nand natural disasters. As such, the choice of our \r\ntheme — “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a \r\ndecent life for all on a sustainable planet” — is not only \r\nappropriate, it is perfectly timed. On that note, on behalf \r\nof the people of Solomon Islands, I extend our heartfelt \r\nsympathies to those affected by the recent natural \r\ndisasters, in particular Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and \r\nMaria. We would like to express our sympathies to the \r\nfamilies who lost loved ones in the recent earthquakes \r\nin Mexico. Whether we are talking about tsunamis, \r\ncyclones, f looding or earthquakes, Solomon Islands \r\nknows well the pain of having to live through such \r\nordeals. Our hearts and prayers are with the victims.\r\nI believe that the theme can effectively be summed \r\nup in three simple yet powerful words — peace, \r\nhumanity and equality. However, I am afraid that the \r\nstatus quo in the world today does not reflect them. \r\nAccording to the Office of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Refugees, approximately 65.6 million \r\npeople worldwide were forcibly displaced at the end of \r\nlast year. Those statistics are the result of persecution, \r\nconflict, violence or human rights violations — the \r\nconsequences of human actions. Sadly, the majority \r\nof the displaced are women and children. They are \r\nthe most vulnerable to the evil designs of their fellow \r\nhuman beings. They must therefore be protected. The \r\nprotection of people is in the DNA of the Organization. \r\nMy Government therefore reaffirms its support for the \r\nresponsibility to protect. The international community \r\nmust continue to stand firm in its fight to prevent \r\ncrimes against humanity.\r\nI stand here with pride in saying that today we in \r\nthe Pacific continue to enjoy the world’s most peaceful \r\ncorner. Although we play a minor role in the geopolitics \r\nof the world, we are now once again caught up in the \r\nmidst of a global power play. History shows that global \r\nevents have often dictated those in the Pacific region. \r\nThey were events beyond our control that were imposed \r\non us. They have had lasting effects on our peoples, \r\nmany of them negative. From bygone world wars \r\nto nuclear tests, to the current instances of military \r\nprovocation, we continue to deal with the remnants of \r\nthose foreign-imposed events.\r\nFor us in Solomon Islands, it was only a month \r\nago that we celebrated the seventy-fifth anniversary \r\nof Guadalcanal, a significant battle of the Second \r\nWorld War. For many, that war ended in 1945, but for \r\nus its repercussions continue. Between 2011 and 2017, \r\napproximately 37,000 pieces of unexploded ordnance, \r\nweighing some 152,000 metric tons, were destroyed. \r\nI thank the Governments of Australia and the United \r\nStates of America for their assistance in that exercise, \r\nwhich continues today.\r\nToday, we are also continually threatened by global \r\npower posturing attempting once again to dictate our \r\nfate as a region. However, we refuse to remain silent. It \r\nis on that note that I would like to register our strongest \r\ncondemnation of the actions by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea. We too would like to echo the global \r\ncall to the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to \r\nabide by the relevant Security Council resolutions. The \r\nrecent testing of ballistic missiles by the Democratic \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 5/27\r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea over the Pacific Ocean is \r\nan insult to the people of the Pacific. We are ocean \r\npeople. The sea is our sanctuary. It is the foundation \r\nof our heritage and where our people source their food \r\nand income. We therefore denounce any pollution or \r\ncontamination of the ocean that our Pacific peoples \r\ndepend on for their livelihoods.\r\nAs the Assembly is well aware, we in the Pacific \r\nsupply approximately 60 per cent of the world’s tuna \r\nmarket, underscoring our region’s global significance. \r\nMaintaining the health of our ocean is therefore not \r\nmerely in our own interests. The maintenance of our \r\nocean, given its importance to global food security, \r\nshould be in all of our interests. In that regard, Solomon \r\nIslands reaffirms the principles enshrined in the United \r\nNations Convention on the Law of the Sea for the \r\npeaceful use of ocean spaces.\r\nWhile the threat of nuclear warfare is a genuine \r\nconcern to us all, for our small island developing States \r\nthe effects of climate change that we are currently \r\nwitnessing at an alarming rate on our shores present \r\na clear and present danger. The concentration of \r\ncarbon dioxide in our oceans now stands at 400 parts \r\nper million. It has passed the safe level of 350 parts \r\nper million and at 550 parts per million will soon \r\nbegin to dissolve our corals. For Pacific nations like \r\nours, climate change continues to be our enemy. We \r\nare constantly invaded by that enemy, every day. In \r\nSolomon Islands, we have lost six islands to the effects \r\nof climate change. What was once a playground for \r\nchildren is now inundated with water. For many of \r\nour peoples, talk of a sustainable world is becoming \r\nincreasingly unattainable. We are in survival mode.\r\nThe horrors of the impact of a nuclear attack are \r\nundeniable, but the slow onset of tragedy caused by \r\nthe adverse impact of climate change is just as cruel. \r\nIf it has not happened yet, it will shortly. An unstable \r\nclimate and people’s subsequent displacement and \r\nrelocation can exacerbate some of the core drivers \r\nof conflict, such as migratory pressures, the clash of \r\ncultures and competition for resources. Those are \r\nthreats to humankind’s very existence and could very \r\nwell morph into threats to global peace and security. \r\nThat is why the Pacific small island developing States \r\nhave been requesting that the Security Council also \r\naddress the issue of climate change.\r\nWhile useful, the building of sea walls and \r\nwave-breakers to mitigate some of the effects of climate \r\nchange is a mere Band-Aid solution. We call on all \r\nmajor greenhouse-gas emitters to meet their national \r\ndetermined contributions for reducing emissions. We \r\nstrongly urge the United States of America to reconsider \r\nits position on the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. \r\nLet us all stand together in solidarity to face the \r\ndefining challenges of our time. With regard to the \r\ntwenty-third session of the Conference of the Parties, \r\nSolomon Islands pledges its full support to Fiji as Chair. \r\nAs a fellow Pacific island country, we congratulate Fiji \r\non its upcoming assumption of the chairship and look \r\nforward to discussions on effective implementation of \r\nthe Paris Agreement.\r\nRegarding peace and security, Solomon Islands \r\nhas contributed a contingent of five police officers \r\nwho have just completed their 12-month tour of duty \r\nin the African Union-United Nations Hybrid Operation \r\nin Darfur, in our first humble contribution to the \r\nmaintenance of world peace. Another eight police \r\nofficers, two of whom are women, are all set to go as soon \r\nas they secure their visas for the Sudan. The African \r\nUnion-United Nations Hybrid Operation in Darfur was \r\nset up to protect civilians in areas where militia groups \r\ncontinue to be active and intercommunal violence still \r\noccurs. The efforts could be made more effective if the \r\nUnited Nations Framework of Analysis for Atrocity \r\nCrimes could be integrated into predeployment and \r\nin-theatre training for all peacekeepers.\r\nThe mandate of the Regional Assistance Mission \r\nto the Solomon Islands ended on 30 June. On behalf \r\nof the people of Solomon Islands, I would like to \r\nsincerely thank members of the Pacific Islands Forum \r\nfor coming to our aid to save us from ourselves. At this \r\njuncture, I would like to pay tribute to those who made \r\nthe ultimate sacrifice during the Mission and to thank \r\ntheir families for their loved ones’ services. I am also \r\ndeeply grateful to Australia and New Zealand for their \r\nexcellent leadership role in the Assistance Mission, \r\nwhich was premised on a regional security framework, \r\nthe Biketawa Declaration. My Government is also very \r\nsupportive of the Pacific islands leaders’ communiqué \r\nfrom the forty-eighth Forum meeting, which calls \r\nfor a comprehensive expansion and updating of the \r\nDeclaration. We believe that a Biketawa-plus that takes \r\ninto consideration the security challenges the region \r\nfaces today, as well as our collective responses to them, \r\nwill help to keeping the Pacific islands region peaceful.\r\nLike other post-conflict countries, Solomon \r\nIslands will continue to face many challenges. \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n6/27 17-29722\r\nSustainable peace will require more than just effective \r\npolicing or a functioning public service. It will require \r\nsocial and economic development initiatives that \r\naddress the underlying causes of the conflict. In that \r\nregard, I must thank the Peacebuilding Commission \r\nfor facilitating our national dialogue on peace and \r\nsustainable development. The communiqué from that \r\ndialogue shows an inclusive and clear consensus on our \r\npriorities for sustaining peace. I therefore look forward \r\nto Solomon Islands being formally declared eligible \r\nfor peacebuilding support from the Peacebuilding \r\nRecovery Facility.\r\nI must also thank the Board of the Green Climate \r\nFund for approving $86 million for the Tina River Hydro \r\nProject when it met in South Korea early this year. The \r\nproject will create more than 200 jobs and offset more \r\nthan 44,000 tons of carbon dioxide per annum in diesel \r\nemissions. It will also provide renewable energy, at a \r\nmore affordable cost, to more than 100,000 people in \r\nand around our capital city of Honiara.\r\nI currently have an issue with the Commission \r\non the Limits of the Continental Shelf and the joint \r\nsubmission by Papua New Guinea, the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia and Solomon Islands concerning the \r\nOntong Java plateau. Solomon Islands notes with serious \r\nconcern that the Commission, in its deliberations, has \r\noverturned the understanding that we had reached with \r\nthe Sub-Commission on the connection of Duff and \r\nAnuta Islands to the continental margin of the Ontong \r\nJava plateau. The Sub-Commission and our joint \r\ndelegation reached mutually acceptable conclusions that \r\nwere the result of comprehensive interactions over two \r\nyears. However, we were not given the opportunity to \r\naddress the amendments proposed by the Commission, \r\ndespite their serious implications for our submission, \r\nnor were we given the reasons for the amendments \r\ndespite our repeated requests. We therefore have no \r\noption but to consider making a revised submission.\r\nA related issue is the negotiations on an implementing \r\nagreement under the United Nations Law of the Sea \r\nConvention on the conservation and sustainable \r\nuse of biological diversity in areas beyond national \r\njurisdictions. The current negotiations undermine the \r\nfundamental principles embodied in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and are grossly inadequate when \r\naddressing the principle of adjacency, the integration \r\nof traditional knowledge, and transboundary and \r\ncumulative impacts as they relate to small island \r\ndeveloping States. There must also be some recognition \r\nfor a funding mechanism that can adequately support \r\nthe implementation of the proposed instrument.\r\nThe Preamble to the Charter of the United Nations \r\nspeaks powerfully of our mission to reaffirm faith in \r\nfundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of \r\nthe human person, and in the equal rights of men and \r\nwomen and of nations large and small. This language \r\nclearly articulates the principle of universality for \r\nall peoples and nations, regardless of their size \r\nor population.\r\nHowever, as we in the Assembly speak of leaving \r\nno one behind, we are at the same time shutting the \r\ndoor for the people of Taiwan in participating in this \r\nuniversal process. We are thereby contradicting our \r\nown principles by leaving 23 million people behind. \r\nAnd yet the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development requires global partnership \r\nand the joint efforts of all stakeholders to mobilize \r\nall available resources. Taiwan is ready, willing and \r\nable to engage in and contribute to the wide range of \r\nsubstantive United Nations programmes for the welfare \r\nof humankind. If we are to focus on people and promote \r\npeace and sustainability, let us give Taiwan and its \r\n23 million people a chance.\r\nLet us not contradict the principles that the United \r\nNations was established to represent and allow the rules \r\nto change based on whose best interests are at stake. \r\nTaiwan has been actively involved in United Nations \r\nprogrammes and specialized agencies. Despite its \r\ncontributions to the well-being of the citizens of the \r\nworld, we continue to ignore Taiwan’s right to self-\r\ndetermination; as such, it is high time that the Assembly \r\ngave due recognition to Taiwan as a legitimate member \r\nof the family of nations.\r\nArticle 73 of our Charter also speaks powerfully on \r\nfundamental human rights. In the 1960 Declaration on \r\nthe granting of independence to colonial countries and \r\npeoples, the General Assembly stated:\r\n“The subjection of peoples to alien subjugation, \r\ndomination and exploitation constitutes a denial \r\nof fundamental human rights, is contrary to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations and is an impediment \r\nto the promotion of world peace and cooperation” \r\n(resolution 1514 (XV), para. 1).\r\nThanks to that Article, the people of New Caledonia \r\nwill hold a referendum in 2018 whereby they can finally \r\ndecide, without fear or favour, on their political future. \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 7/27\r\nI wish them all the best. I must thank and commend \r\nthe administering Power for working closely with the \r\nSpecial Committee on Decolonization (Committee \r\nof 24) on the issue of New Caledonia. I hope that the \r\nsame level of cooperation will also be shown on French \r\nPolynesia and that a visit by the Committee of 24 will \r\noccur soon.\r\nThe position of Solomon Islands on the issues \r\nI have mentioned is premised on principles that we \r\nhave consistently upheld. In this connection, Solomon \r\nIslands condemns the consistent human rights violations \r\nin West Papua. Our Sustainable Development Goals, \r\nwhich promote the notion of no one being left behind, \r\nwill be empty promises unless we in the United Nations \r\ntake active steps to address the plight of the peoples \r\nof West Papua. Indeed, we left them behind some 50 \r\nyears ago when, as a family of nations, we noted their \r\nplight without adding much. Since then, the peoples of \r\nWest Papua have never been allowed the proper act of \r\nself-determination guaranteed by the inalienable right \r\nto self-determination, as expressed in United Nations \r\nhuman rights covenants.\r\nOnly the international action of individual \r\ncountries and the leading organizational bodies of the \r\ninternational system, especially the General Assembly, \r\ncan pave the way for the recognition of a people whose \r\nright to self-determination has been denied for nearly 50 \r\nyears. Failing that, we as a family of nations will become \r\ncomplicit in perpetuating suffering and being blind to \r\ninjustice, missing yet another golden opportunity to \r\nremain true to the idea of leaving no one behind. At the \r\nseventy-first session, a group of Pacific Island nations \r\ncalled for the General Assembly to address the human \r\nrights violations in West Papua. Today, I stand before \r\nthe Assembly on behalf of my people and those of the \r\nPacific region to reiterate that same call to address the \r\nplight of West Papuan women, children and men.\r\nOur people are watching, West Papuans in West \r\nPapua are watching, praying and hoping for a brighter \r\nfuture. They have come in numbers to express their hope \r\nfor a better future. We as leaders have the responsibility \r\nto leave no one behind. I would therefore encourage \r\nIndonesia to engage in more constructive dialogue, \r\nincluding with West Papua, to find a way forward in \r\naddressing the aspirations of the people of West Papua. \r\nI urge the United Nations to proactively engage in those \r\ndialogues as well.\r\nViolence against women and girls is one of the most \r\nwidespread violations of human rights worldwide, my \r\ncountry and region included. Violence against women is \r\nan obstacle to gender equality, economic opportunities \r\nand livelihoods. The final Pacific Regional Millennium \r\nDevelopment Goals Tracking Report, published in 2015, \r\nhighlighted the fact that violence against women was an \r\nimpediment to achieving the Millennium Development \r\nGoals. If our region is to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, we will have to intensify efforts \r\nand increase support and cooperation to end violence \r\nagainst women and girls.\r\nThe Solomon Islands Family Protection Act of 2014 \r\nwas a national response to the urgent need to curtail the \r\nincreasing rate of domestic violence. It was aimed at \r\nensuring that homes in Solomon Islands, as important \r\nunits of the community, are peaceful and safe for \r\nall members of a family. The Act covers any type of \r\nabuse that happens in the home between perpetrators \r\nand victims of domestic violence. Yes, we have made \r\nbig strides in not just counting women, but more \r\nimportantly, in making women count.\r\nAs a small island developing State and least \r\ndeveloped country with inherent structural capacity \r\nconstraints, we greatly rely on the United Nations \r\nsystem to support and augment our national efforts in \r\nimplementing national development programmes. It is \r\nour hope that this expectation will be met by concrete \r\nand measurable deliverables on the ground by our \r\nUnited Nations partners.\r\nMy delegation welcomes the Secretary-General’s \r\nreform agenda and applauds his vision for repositioning \r\nsustainable development at the heart of the United \r\nNations. Its guiding framework, the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development, with its pledge to leave \r\nno one behind, is indeed our boldest agenda for \r\nhumankind. For my country, it will have to include \r\nfair representation in the recruitment of staff to the \r\nUnited Nations Secretariat. Despite having only one \r\nnational at the Secretariat, we have not been invited \r\nto sit the young professionals’ exams for two years in \r\na row now. We nevertheless remain steadfast in our \r\nsupport and encouragement of action for a strong and \r\neffective United Nations, and we stand ready to support \r\nthe Secretary-General’s noble efforts to transform the \r\nOrganization, including the Security Council.\r\nThe United Nations is still the town hall of our \r\nglobal village. People know what it does but do not \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n8/27 17-29722\r\nsee much value in it. It is inevitably imperfect. As \r\nthe Organization’s second Secretary-General, Dag \r\nHammarskjöld, famously said, “The United Nations \r\nwas not created to take humanity to heaven, but to \r\nsave it from hell”. The Organization’s imperfections, \r\nhowever, only mean that we need to work harder to \r\nmake it better. So let us do that.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Manasseh Sogavare, Prime Minister of \r\nSolomon Islands, was escorted from the General \r\nAssembly Hall.\r\nAddress by Mr. Zoran Zaev, President of the \r\nGovernment of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the President of the Government of \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.\r\nMr. Zoran Zaev, President of the Government of \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Zoran Zaev, President \r\nof the Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Zaev (Macedonia) (spoke in Macedonian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): It is an honour \r\nfor me to address the Assembly and to share the Republic \r\nof Macedonia’s positions on the most important issues \r\non the United Nations agenda. I firmly believe that we \r\nshare the common goal of world peace. I also believe \r\nthat we share the same commitments to a decent life for \r\nall in a sustainable environment and, further, that we \r\nwill find common solutions to our common challenges. \r\nPeace, commitment to a decent life, and joint solutions \r\nare the values that the Republic of Macedonia has \r\nrelied on in overcoming a deep political crisis that had \r\nrepercussions throughout our region.\r\nWe are a small, diverse countryy. We have \r\nmanaged to overcome difficult challenges because we \r\nhave united around common values. That is why today \r\nthe Republic of Macedonia is again free, secure and \r\nstable. It is a friend to all its neighbours and is firmly \r\noriented towards full integration into NATO and the \r\nEuropean Union.\r\n(spoke in English)\r\nAs Head of the Delegation of the Republic of \r\nMacedonia, I want to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák of the Slovak Republic on his \r\nelection to the prestigious position of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session. I would \r\nalso like to express our full support to Secretary-General \r\nGuterres. We wish him great success in carrying out his \r\ncomprehensive, ambitious and much-needed agenda to \r\ntransform and adapt the United Nations to enable it to \r\nmeet its demanding tasks and our common challenges, \r\nboth existing and emerging.\r\nThe United Nations must continue to do more \r\nand better to meet those challenges and stand the test \r\nof time. We must be vigilant and constant, but also \r\nseek to develop innovative and adaptable conflict \r\nprevention, sustainable development and management \r\nreform mechanisms, while building on the foundations \r\nenshrined in the Charter of the United Nations and \r\nother core documents.\r\nThe world is plagued by severe humanitarian crises, \r\nnew and protracted old conflicts, the intensification of \r\nterrorist attacks and violent extremism, human rights \r\nabuses and increasing climate-change effects. Different \r\nin scope and weight, those challenges have become \r\nmore complex. They require a wide-ranging response. \r\nWhile we have been able to mitigate the consequences \r\nfor some, others remain unabated. Just a few weeks ago, \r\nwe witnessed devastating natural disasters in the Gulf \r\nof Mexico and South Asia. That is a harsh reminder that \r\nour planet is changing, and we all have an obligation \r\nto do our best to mitigate and hopefully reverse the \r\nconsequences. We can progress if we are united.\r\nThe promotion and protection of human rights, \r\ndemocracy and the rule of law must remain at the core \r\nof our action. Despite the fact that the United Nations \r\nhas a robust human rights architecture, the current \r\nblatant human rights violations, widespread impunity \r\nand lack of accountability around the globe remind us \r\nthat there is much to be done.\r\nMonstrous terrorist attacks have increased in \r\nnumber. Our actions must focus on preventing violent \r\nextremism and radicalization, as they are major factors \r\nfor terrorist recruitment. The establishment of the \r\nUnited Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism, in which \r\none of the priority areas is prevention, was a welcome \r\nstep. For our part, we are also working on a national \r\nstrategy for the prevention of violent extremism and \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 9/27\r\nradicalization. I am aware that there are differing \r\napproaches to those crucial issues, as we have divergent \r\nviews among us. However, I would like to urge the \r\ninternational community not to focus on its differences, \r\nbut rather on its primary responsibility to act robustly \r\nfor the common good.\r\nThe proliferation of weapons of mass destruction \r\nand their means of delivery continues to jeopardize \r\nglobal security. The implementation of Security Council \r\nresolution 1540 (2004) is key to minimizing the possible \r\ndisastrous consequences for the generations to come. In \r\nthat regard, let me underline that we are deeply alarmed \r\nby the continued unilateral actions of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, which has been conducting \r\nnuclear tests and missile launches despite the repeated \r\ncalls of the international community to fully comply \r\nwith the relevant Security Council resolutions. We \r\nbelieve that the peaceful denuclearization of the \r\nKorean peninsula is possible, and we therefore urge the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to immediately \r\nabandon its nuclear and missile programmes and to sign \r\nand ratify the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty.\r\nLet me comment briefly on the main theme of the \r\ncurrent session of the General Assembly, “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on \r\na sustainable planet”. States must remain focused on \r\nthe implementation of the new sustainable development \r\nagenda that we agreed on at the seventieth anniversary \r\nof our Organization. That remarkable undertaking laid \r\nthe foundations for the future development framework. \r\nThat had implications for many other important areas \r\nof common concern.\r\nMany vital issues affecting global prosperity \r\nare related to the implementation of that agenda. It is \r\ntherefore important to continue to encourage and build \r\nnew avenues of cooperation and new partnerships among \r\nus. That is central to the integration of the economic, \r\nenvironmental and social dimensions of sustainability. \r\nThose are the fundamentals for development and a \r\nhopeful future, as well as for our peace, stability and \r\nsecurity. At the national level, our efforts to transform \r\nagreed goals into practice are included in the new \r\nUnited Nations Development Assistance Framework \r\nprogramme, the 2016-2020 United Nations Partnership \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\nHere I would like to mention to last year’s important \r\nsummit on the issue of large-scale movements of \r\nrefugees and migrants. That is a global phenomenon \r\nwith various causes and diverse implications. The \r\nUnited Nations adopted a comprehensive political \r\ndeclaration and pledged to intensify international \r\ncooperation, in particular among countries of origin or \r\nnationality, transit and destination.\r\nThe Republic of Macedonia supports and is \r\nparticipating in the ongoing consultation processes on \r\nthe two compacts dealing with refugees and migrants. \r\nWe expect an outcome that will address all aspects of \r\nthese global phenomena. Let me remind everyone that \r\nin the past couple of years, hundreds of thousands of \r\nmigrants have transited through my country and the \r\nregion. Even though that presented complex challenges, \r\nwe managed to provide humanitarian assistance to \r\nthe people in need. Since we have to adapt globally, \r\nwe must also do our homework and act as responsible \r\nGovernments in order to secure and provide a better \r\nfuture and prosperity for our people.\r\nThe Government of the Republic of Macedonia \r\naffirms its dedication to fundamental democratic values, \r\ngood governance, the rule of law and respect for human \r\nrights. We overcame a deep political and institutional \r\ncrisis through our resolute stand in defence of those \r\nfundamentals. Our understanding is that democracy \r\nmust be driven by civic engagement from the bottom \r\nup. Societies are better off when decision-making \r\nis comprehensive, inclusive and transparent. Public \r\npolicies must work for citizens’ well-being.\r\nMy Government has laid out an ambitious reform \r\nplan with short-, medium- and long-term measures. \r\nOur goal is to restore democracy, build professional and \r\nindependent institutions and improve the standard of \r\nliving for every citizen, and to expedite the integration \r\nof the Republic of Macedonia into the European Union \r\nand NATO.\r\nFrom the depths of a political crisis we have emerged \r\nstronger, and we have been able to contribute to regional \r\nstability and cooperation. Those who know Balkan \r\nhistory know that our region has not always been seen \r\nin a positive light. I strongly believe that we have a new \r\nchance to make a change, not just in perceptions but in \r\nsubstance. Over the past few months, the Government \r\nof the Republic of Macedonia has strongly promoted a \r\nnew approach to its neighbours. We have demonstrated \r\nthe capacity to overcome open issues. We have \r\narticulated our national interests and acted in pursuit of \r\nthem. At the same time, we have been fully aware and \r\nrespectful of the national interests of our neighbours. \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n10/27 17-29722\r\nOur policy is based on solving issues through dialogue \r\nand cooperation. We hope that that approach will \r\ninspire others and stimulate a new approach to bilateral \r\nrelations in our region. As a positive step forward, let \r\nme underscore our signing of a bilateral agreement \r\non friendship, good-neighbourliness and cooperation \r\nwith Bulgaria. That represents a joint success for the \r\ntwo countries.\r\nThis session of the General Assembly represents \r\nthe twenty-fifth year of our participation as an \r\nindependent State. Next year, we will mark a quarter-\r\ncentury of our United Nations membership. However, \r\nthat anniversary is also marked by the dispute over how \r\nmy country should be referred to, which has unilateral \r\nconsequences on our development and perspectives.\r\nThe Interim Accord of 1995 laid the foundations \r\nfor a normalization of relations between Macedonia and \r\nGreece. At present, the two countries are implementing \r\nconfidence-building measures, and that is a very \r\npositive development. We have a fresh impetus to \r\novercome the long-standing bilateral dispute. I would \r\nsay that we have both made certain mistakes at various \r\ntimes, but the main goal now is to resolve the issue and \r\nclose it.\r\nI firmly believe that we must seize the momentum, \r\nconduct discussions in good faith and resolve the issue \r\nfor our shared future. We greatly value the continuing \r\nefforts of the Personal Envoy of the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Matthew Nimetz, and the good offices that he \r\nprovides to that end. I firmly believe that there is a \r\nway to overcome the problem that Greece has with our \r\nconstitutional name. For a change, let us try to approach \r\nit from a positive point of view.\r\nMaintaining good neighbourly and friendly \r\nrelations is a two-way street. We are committed to \r\ndoing our job and expect the same of our neighbours. \r\nThat message has already been clearly sent to our \r\nfriends and partners. I would like to reaffirm it here, \r\nfrom the rostrum, where all of us have been recalling \r\nthe purposes and principals of the Charter of the United \r\nNations. The world can be a very noisy place, but the \r\nmost important things can be very quiet. I believe that \r\nif we listen to our peoples, we can hear the world.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to underline that the \r\nRepublic of Macedonia remains a staunch supporter \r\nof multilateralism. We will continue to work with \r\nthe United Nations and all Member States on jointly \r\nreinforcing world peace and security, promoting human \r\nrights, achieving the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand dealing with all the other issues that are crucial for \r\nthe people we represent.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the President of the \r\nGovernment of the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Zoran Zaev, President of the Government of \r\nthe former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nEthiopia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nDemocratic Republic of Ethiopia.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Hailemariam Desalegn, \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nEthiopia, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Desalegn (Ethiopia): I would like to join \r\nother delegations in congratulating the President on \r\nhis election to preside over the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session, and I wish \r\nto assure him of the support and cooperation of my \r\ndelegation in the discharge of his responsibilities \r\nthrough the course of the session. Let me also take this \r\nopportunity to express appreciation to his predecessor, \r\nwho effectively guided the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its previous session.\r\nWe welcome the appointment of Mr. António \r\nGuterres as the new Secretary-General and support his \r\ncall for a surge in diplomacy for peace in addressing \r\nthe many crisis situations that the world is facing today. \r\nLet me stress here we are behind the Secretary-General \r\nin his efforts to reform the Organization in the three \r\ninterrelated areas of development, peace and security, \r\nand management.\r\nIt has been indeed a great pleasure and honour \r\nfor Ethiopia to preside over the work of the Security \r\nCouncil during this important month, when world \r\nleaders gather in New York for the new session of the \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 11/27\r\nGeneral Assembly to discuss issues of global peace, \r\nsecurity and development. We would like to express \r\nour gratitude to all the delegations that participated \r\nin the high-level open debate of the Security Council \r\non Wednesday, 20 September, on the reform of United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations (see S/PV.8051). As \r\na leading troop-contributing country, Ethiopia attaches \r\ngreat importance to strengthening the role of United \r\nNations peacekeeping in addressing challenges to \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\nIn that regard, we welcome the unanimous adoption \r\nof Security Council resolution 2378 (2017), which we \r\nintroduced on Wednesday, and we thank all delegations \r\nthat sponsored the resolution, which reaffirms the \r\ncentral role of United Nations peacekeeping as one of \r\nthe most effective tools available to the world in the \r\npromotion and maintenance of international peace \r\nand security.\r\nThat the world is facing unprecedented challenges \r\nto its peace and prosperity has been all too apparent for \r\nquite some time now. Geopolitical tensions reminiscent \r\nof the Cold War are increasing. The proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction is posing a real threat \r\nto global peace and security. Terrorism and violent \r\nextremism continue to wreak havoc across various parts \r\nof the world. Global income inequality is no longer just \r\na development challenge; it is also a security threat. \r\nClimate change is not a fiction but real, and we are \r\nwitnessing its devastating consequences for humankind \r\nand the planet. Countries such as my own continue to \r\nface that horrendous challenge to their development.\r\nThree major peace and security reviews were \r\nconducted only two years ago, providing valuable \r\nrecommendations, which, if implemented, could \r\nhelp the United Nations keep pace with the changing \r\nglobal security dynamics and respond effectively to \r\nnew and emerging peace and security challenges in a \r\ncomprehensive, systematic and coordinated manner. \r\nThe clear conclusion of the three major reviews was \r\nthat the primary United Nations approach to resolving \r\nconflicts should be a political one. Indeed, the many \r\nconflict and crisis situations around the world cannot \r\nbe resolved other than through political means. That \r\nholds true not only for the crisis in South Sudan, close to \r\nmy country, but also for the conflicts that are raging in \r\nthe Middle East, including in Syria and Yemen, as well \r\nas the dangerous situation on the Korean peninsula. It \r\nis therefore only by reaffirming our commitments to \r\nthe letter and spirit of Chapter VI of the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations, on the pacific settlement of disputes, \r\nthat we can effectively respond to the global peace and \r\nsecurity challenges we are facing today.\r\nHowever, that is obviously easier said than \r\ndone. That is because without the political will and \r\ncommitment of the conflicting parties to finding a \r\npolitical solution through dialogue and negotiation, \r\npeace is bound to elude us. A common purpose and \r\nresolve on the part of all external actors involved in \r\nthe search for a political solution to conflict and crisis \r\nsituations are also absolutely vital. What current global \r\nsecurity requires is a stronger and more effective global \r\nand regional partnership in the service of conflict \r\nprevention and peace. What we have repeatedly seen is \r\nthat in the absence of that partnership, which must be \r\nunderpinned by the principles of complementarity and \r\ncoherence, no meaningful progress can be achieved. \r\nThe United Nations should be able to play a leading role \r\nin forging those kinds of partnerships and in sharing \r\nthe burden in accordance with the Charter.\r\nThe links connecting peace, security and \r\ndevelopment have long been recognized, and that was \r\nalso the other clear key message emanating from the \r\nthree major peace and security reviews. More peaceful \r\nand inclusive societies generate an environment \r\nconducive to sustainable development, and sustainable \r\npeace is both an enabler and an outcome of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. The year 2015 was indeed seminal in \r\nthat regard. The commitment that we made in this Hall \r\nto the transformative 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment and to inclusiveness, leaving no one \r\nbehind, was the result of our shared conviction that our \r\nfates and futures are linked and that poverty is a shared \r\nchallenge. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nwere further reinforced by the adoption of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, which entered into \r\nforce last November, thereby strengthening the global \r\nresponse to the threats posed by that phenomenon.\r\nToday, however, it is no longer the time to celebrate \r\nthose achievements; we need rather to reflect where we \r\nare in terms of their implementation. Though the SDGs \r\nwere endorsed by all with much optimism, the current \r\nstate of affairs is far from reassuring. The global \r\nsituation since their adoption has not been conducive \r\nto ensuring their reasonably effective implementation. \r\nThat is a major disappointment for all those who have \r\nbeen hoping to see renewed global partnership in the \r\nspirit of the 2030 Agenda.\r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n12/27 17-29722\r\nFor our part, we have fully embraced and begun to \r\nrecord encouraging initial results in implementing the \r\n2030 Agenda. We have continued to invest in our people \r\nso as to improve their well-being. In order to achieve \r\nstructural transformation and diversify our economy, \r\nthe Government is expanding our manufacturing sector \r\nand infrastructure facilities, which have continued to \r\nattract an increasing amount of domestic and foreign \r\ninvestments. In order to finance our ambitious national \r\nprojects, we are mobilizing domestic resources while \r\nmaximizing the positive impacts of foreign assistance. \r\nBy implementing integrated, pro-poor policies, we \r\nhave been reducing poverty and enhancing the quality \r\nof life, and we have sustained our rapid and inclusive \r\neconomic growth.\r\nEthiopia is therefore projected to be the fastest \r\ngrowing economy in the world by the end of 2017. That \r\nshould, of course, not be a source of complacency; \r\nit should rather drive us further to redouble our \r\ndetermination and endeavours to accelerate the full \r\nimplementation of our current national development \r\npolicy, which integrates the SDGs, and we will \r\nremain fully committed to realizing the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, to responding to the legitimate \r\ndevelopment demands of our people and to addressing \r\nour multifaceted development challenges. That is not \r\neasy, nor are our challenges uncomplicated, most \r\nparticularly those related to natural phenomena.\r\nWe in Ethiopia, like many other countries, are \r\ndealing almost every day with the adverse effects \r\nof climate change. Now is not the time, therefore, to \r\ndoubt their devastating impact, while millions of our \r\nfellow humans are losing their lives and their hard-\r\nwon development achievements. That is happening \r\nall over the world. It is high time to act urgently and \r\ndecisively to combat the adverse impacts of climate \r\nchange, particularly its disproportionately bad effect \r\non the most vulnerable countries, which, as has been \r\nrepeatedly pointed out, bear almost no responsibility \r\nfor causing climate change.\r\nClimate change, not just poverty, is our major \r\nchallenge. The current climate-induced drought is \r\naffecting millions of people. For the third consecutive \r\nyear, after successfully dealing with the El Niño-induced \r\ndrought in 2015, Ethiopia is confronting the adverse \r\neffects of climate change. That is why I said earlier \r\nthat climate change is real and poses a clear danger \r\nfor humankind, because it undermines development \r\ngains. We are doing everything that we can to mitigate \r\nits negative effects, with the continuing and much \r\nappreciated support of our bilateral and multilateral \r\npartners. While we are committed to addressing our \r\ncurrent humanitarian emergency, we will also continue \r\nto implement our national strategy to build a green and \r\nresilient economy.\r\nCountries such as Ethiopia that are fully committed \r\nto implementing the Sustainable Development Agenda \r\nrequire an international environment that can help \r\nthem succeed in their fight against poverty. Ending \r\npoverty, achieving prosperity for all and preserving \r\nour planet are attainable goals. We know that we have \r\nthe resources and the capabilities to achieve a world \r\nfree from poverty. We have begun implementing the \r\nSDGs, albeit unevenly, but time is of the essence. We \r\nmust accelerate the process if we are to leave no one \r\nbehind. That has enormous meaning for peace, security \r\nand prosperity as well. Poverty and economies that fail \r\nto produce employment opportunities are not fertile \r\nground for peace to grow in and be nurtured.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Hailemariam Desalegn, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of \r\nGovernment of the Principality of Andorra\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Head of Government of the \r\nPrincipality of Andorra.\r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government \r\nof the Principality of Andorra, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Antoni Martí Petit, \r\nHead of Government of the Principality of Andorra, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Martí Petit (Andorra) (spoke in Catalan; \r\nSpanish text provided by the delegation): I would like \r\nto begin by congratulating the President, Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák, on his choice of theme for the seventy-second \r\nsession of the General Assembly. The link between \r\npeace and a dignified life is, without a doubt, one of the \r\nkey issues of our time — as is sustainable development, \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 13/27\r\nwhich has become the principal challenge facing the \r\ninternational community. The priorities set forth by \r\nthe President and the theme for the current session \r\nhighlight the close link between peace, a dignified life \r\nand a sustainable planet.\r\nThe choice of those priorities and theme are in \r\nkeeping with what we have been building together over \r\nthe years, as reflected in the aims of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, which we agreed on \r\ntwo years ago, and are also based on the actions of the \r\nSecretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, during his \r\nfirst nine months at the helm of the United Nations.\r\nNext year will mark 70 years since the publication \r\nof the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the first \r\nmajor joint success of the United Nations. Throughout \r\nthose seven decades, we have learned that the goals \r\nshared by all of humankind are interrelated. The \r\nUnited Nations was founded with the fundamental \r\naim of preventing conflicts and ensuring peace. Over \r\nthe centuries, all our parliaments and assemblies have \r\nbeen established on the basis of that goal, namely, to \r\npeacefully resolve conflicts and make decisions that \r\naffect us all together. This parliament, an assembly of \r\nall the countries of the world, was also founded on that \r\nvery desire.\r\nSoon afterwards, the original objective of \r\nmaintaining peace and security was joined by those \r\nof promoting human rights and, subsequently, by the \r\neconomic and social development of nations and their \r\ncitizens. That in itself was because the international \r\ncommunity became aware of the strong relationship \r\nbetween development opportunities and the prevention \r\nof conflict. A fairer world with fewer inequalities, with \r\nopportunities for all and respect for our differences, \r\nwill tend to be a safer and more peaceful world.\r\nIt was several decades ago that the United Nations \r\nturned its focus towards another major objective, \r\nnamely, sustainability, caring for the environment and, \r\nmore specifically, the fight against climate change. In \r\nJune we marked the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nsigning of the United Nations Framework Convention \r\non Climate Change in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Its \r\nfour objectives — peace, human rights, development \r\nand sustainability — continue to be priorities. All \r\nfour are tightly interconnected, and all four require a \r\nmultilateral approach, since no country, no matter how \r\npowerful, can guarantee peace and security alone.\r\nNo country or group of countries can implement \r\ndevelopment policies alone, and no country can fight \r\nclimate change alone. We must therefore continue to \r\nuphold inclusive multilateralism. It is not enough to \r\nsimply work together to resolve issues that affect us \r\nall — the solutions we agree on should leave no one \r\nbehind. They must be fair and inclusive, and we must \r\nmake sure that they benefit us all.\r\nIt is in that spirit that Andorra has become a \r\nmember of the Economic and Social Council for 2017 \r\nto 2019, because it is in that Council that inclusive \r\nmultilateralism is truly significant. The Economic and \r\nSocial Council is the clearest manifestation that the \r\nUnited Nations not only strives to be an assembly of \r\nthe world’s countries but also wants to have a direct \r\nimpact on the lives of citizens all over the world. If, as \r\nthe Secretary-General stated, development is the key to \r\nconflict prevention, the Economic and Social Council \r\nis a key tool for that.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nalso plays a key role. For that reason, Andorra will \r\nparticipate in the next round of voluntary national \r\nreviews of the Sustainable Development Goals, which \r\nwill evaluate our implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nand accelerate its effective application.\r\nEveryone here knows that we live in a world of \r\nconstant assessment. Rating agencies measure the \r\nsolvency of our countries, the World Trade Organization \r\nanalyses the level of openness and interdependence \r\nof our economies and the Organization of Economic \r\nCooperation and Development ensures transparency \r\nand healthy fiscal competition between States. Never \r\nbefore have we experienced the evaluative capacity of \r\nvarious international agencies and bodies so intensely, \r\nespecially in the economic and financial sphere.\r\nThat is a positive thing, but it will not be if we \r\nlimit those evaluations to the economic and financial \r\nsphere. We must be equally demanding in the social \r\nsphere — although economic progress does indeed \r\nplay a very important role in constructing a fairer and \r\nsafer world. The promotion of a decent life and social \r\ndevelopment are also essential elements. That is what the \r\nvoluntary national reviews are — a means of measuring \r\nall we are doing to attain the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals of the 2030 Agenda. Andorra will submit its \r\nvoluntary report next July. The various ministries and \r\ndepartments of the Andorran Government have, in \r\nfact, been working for some time to align our internal \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n14/27 17-29722\r\npolicies with the 2030 Agenda and ensure that our \r\ninternal actions comply with each of the 17 Goals to \r\nwhich we all committed on 25 September 2015.\r\nFrom a social perspective, the work that Andorra \r\nhas done over the past year to develop a white paper \r\non equality as a basis for cross-cutting actions to foster \r\ninclusion in both the public and the private sectors is a \r\nclear example. When I say that Andorra is developing \r\nthis white paper, I mean the country as a whole, not \r\njust the Government. Of course, the Government and \r\nParliament must act as initiators and leaders, but they do \r\nso with the full participation of civil society. The white \r\npaper will lead to a law on equality, which should be \r\nthe key tool in our effort to eradicate the discrimination \r\nthat still persists in our society.\r\nAll that work is clearly aligned with Goal 5 on \r\ngender equality and Goal 10 on reducing inequalities \r\nwithin and among countries. Inclusive multilateralism, \r\nwhich I mentioned a few moments ago, should not only \r\nprevail in the General Assembly but should also guide \r\nour internal policies. At the national level, we need to \r\ninvolve the largest possible number of actors and find \r\nsolutions that work for everyone.\r\nThere are also other examples of Andorra’s efforts \r\nin the context of domestic policy, such as in the area \r\nof education, which is directly linked to Goal 4 of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda. In that regard, we are working to \r\nintroduce competency-based education; to continue \r\nand improve the coexistence of our three educational \r\nsystems — in Spanish, French and Andorran — all of \r\nwhich are public, free of charge and open to all; and to \r\nincorporate human rights and democratic values in our \r\ncurriculums for children and young people. All three \r\nof those efforts are also in line with the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, and in some instances are inspired \r\nby them. A good example of our commitment to \r\ninternational educational standards is the Government’s \r\nrecent adoption of the UNESCO Convention against \r\nDiscrimination in Education, a key international \r\ninstrument for promoting equal opportunity.\r\nWhile the relationship between peace, human \r\nrights, security and inclusive development is clear and \r\nundeniable, it is also increasingly obvious that combating \r\nclimate change is a crucial pillar of that edifice. That is \r\nbecause the destruction of ecosystems and the natural \r\ndisasters linked to climate change directly and cruelly \r\naffect the most vulnerable people; because a scarcity \r\nof natural resources is at the heart of many current \r\nconflicts; because the new paradigm of sustainability \r\ndrastically changes our previous notion of economic \r\nand social development; and because — and pardon me \r\nfor mentioning the obvious — if we destroy the planet, \r\nthere will be no sense in talking about peace, security \r\nor development. Fighting climate change will therefore \r\ncontinue to take up much of the debate now and in the \r\nfuture on international actions and initiatives. That is \r\nwhy seven of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals are \r\ndirectly related to environmental issues. It is key that \r\nmuch of the our Governments’ domestic efforts should \r\naddress that issue.\r\nIn recent times, Andorra has become very aware \r\nof the relevance of fighting climate change, and we \r\nhave demonstrated that through actions. Thanks to \r\nan ambitious aid programme, Andorra has one of the \r\nworld’s most significant growth rates per inhabitant for \r\nelectric automobiles and numbers of points for charging \r\nelectric vehicles. Given that heating buildings is one \r\nof our biggest sources of greenhouse-gas emissions, \r\nwe are investing substantially in network projects that \r\ncentralize heat generation, making it more efficient \r\nand less polluting. We are also implementing a policy \r\nof incentives and obligations to promote citizens’ own \r\nproduction of renewable solar and geothermal energy. \r\nLastly, we are drafting a law on energy transition that \r\nwill make all such policies mandatory.\r\nAs most members of the international community \r\nstated in December 2015, we do not want this effort \r\nto remain merely pious words or a catalogue of good \r\nintentions that will not be translated into concrete action. \r\nWe therefore welcome the initiative of Mr. Emmanuel \r\nMacron, the President of our partner country, France, to \r\npromote a global compact for the environment, which \r\nwill collect and harmonize all of the agreements signed \r\nand implemented since the United Nations Conference \r\non Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro \r\nin 1992 through to the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange — because it is important that all global action \r\nto protect the environment and fight climate change be \r\nreflected in specific rights and obligations for States \r\nand individuals. Andorra heartily welcomes the work \r\nthat has been done so far for the global compact, which \r\nincludes, as a substantive right for individuals, the right \r\nto a sound and healthy environment. Here, our 1993 \r\nConstitution was a bellwether, as it includes the right to \r\na clean environment as a citizens’ right and, therefore, \r\na duty for the public authorities.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 15/27\r\nThe various international conventions aimed \r\nat protecting the environment must be reflected in \r\nspecific actions that will have tangible effects for \r\npeople, because the negative effects of climate change \r\nand global warming have been apparent for some time \r\nand are having a very negative effect on the planet \r\nand its inhabitants. I have in mind especially the \r\nconcerns we have about the Pacific islands, which are \r\nthreatened by a rise in sea levels, the fragile ecosystems \r\nof mountainous countries such as Andorra, and the \r\nextraordinary, devastating force of the hurricanes that \r\nhave been hitting the Caribbean region recently.\r\nMore than ever before, we need inclusive \r\nmultilateralism that will leave no one behind. But we \r\nalso need effective multilateralism that works, offers \r\nconcrete results and responds to people’s problems. Work \r\nto that end begins here at United Nations Headquarters, \r\nwhich must adjust the Organization to the needs of both \r\ncountries and their citizens. The first mission of any \r\norganization, from private companies to Governments, \r\nis an internal one — ensuring that its members and \r\nstructures are aligned with its final objectives and that \r\nthey are well prepared to respond to various needs. We \r\ntherefore welcome the fact that one of the first steps \r\ntaken by Secretary-General Guterres was on his project \r\nto reform the United Nations development system.\r\nIf we really believe that peace, human rights, \r\ndevelopment and sustainability are closely interrelated, \r\nwe would logically expect the various bodies and \r\ncommittees dealing with such issues to work together in \r\na coordinated manner, just as it is logical and necessary \r\nfor specific problems to be managed by specific \r\ndepartments. Proof of the fact that the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is doing a good job is his decision to establish \r\na United Nations Office of Counter-Terrorism headed \r\nby an Under-Secretary-General.\r\nThe importance of fighting terrorism has been \r\ntrumpeted everywhere in recent years. We Andorrans \r\nhave seen our European neighbours suffer directly from \r\nthe consequences of such irrational hatred. In Spain \r\nlast month, Barcelona and Cambrils, two Catalan towns \r\nthat are close to Andorra, suffered from the problem.\r\nPeace and security have more complex dimensions \r\ntoday than they did 70 years ago. In the mid-twentieth \r\ncentury, after two world wars, the maintenance of peace \r\nand security could be addressed and resolved here in \r\nthe Assembly through frank dialogue and effective \r\ncooperation and among countries. Bilateral diplomacy \r\nalso played a significant role. Today, with the global \r\nthreat of terrorism, while diplomacy between States \r\ncontinues to be very important in settling issues of \r\npeace and security, they also require concrete action \r\nfor combating terrorism and eradicating its root causes. \r\nThe Secretary-General can therefore count on Andorra’s \r\nsupport for his establishment of the Office of Counter-\r\nTerrorism and other measures designed to improve \r\nthe functioning of the Organization and provide the \r\neffective answers that citizens of the world expect from \r\nall of us.\r\nThe question of the effectiveness of the United \r\nNations is important not only for the Secretary-General \r\nbut also clearly for all of us States Members of the \r\nOrganization. It is all of us who must work to ensure \r\nthat global agreements, starting with the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, are truly binding, to assess with \r\ntransparency various countries’ compliance with those \r\nagreements and to avoid the possibility that the United \r\nNations and the international community could become \r\nparalysed or inactive in the face of the great challenges \r\nand major crises of our times.\r\nIt is for those reasons that Andorra has supported, \r\nand will continue to support, the Rome Statute and the \r\nKampala Amendments, which make it possible for the \r\nInternational Criminal Court to exercise its jurisdiction \r\nin cases of crimes of aggression that clearly violate \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. Allowing the Court \r\nto act ex officio in the most serious cases without the \r\nneed for referrals by the Security Council would be \r\na meaningful step forward for the rule of law at the \r\ninternational level.\r\nFor the same reason, Andorra will continue to \r\nsupport initiatives that seek to limit the right of the veto \r\nfor the permanent members of the Security Council in \r\ncases of genocide or serious human rights violations. \r\nIn our opinion, the political declaration adopted two \r\nyears ago on the initiative of the French Republic \r\nand the United Mexican States, which provides for \r\nthe suspension of the veto in cases involving mass \r\natrocities, is a good course of action to follow.\r\nNo one should be surprised by the fact that \r\nAndorrans are faithful defenders of the multilateral \r\norder. Like other small countries, we firmly believe \r\nthat the major challenges of our time must be addressed \r\nglobally, and that what the various countries of the \r\nworld can do for themselves amounts to very little \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n16/27 17-29722\r\nwithout global and concerted action. That is why much \r\nof our foreign policy is focused on multilateral forums, \r\nas we showed four years ago during the Andorran \r\npresidency of the Council of Europe. Evidence for \r\nthat will also be seen next month, when Andorra hosts \r\nthe Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for \r\nSecurity and Cooperation in Europe, and from our \r\ncandidacy to organize the Ibero-American Summit \r\nin 2020.\r\nThe Ibero-American community is in mourning \r\ntoday for the victims of the earthquake that took place in \r\nMexico last Tuesday. The Government and the Mexican \r\npeople know that they can count on the sympathy and \r\nsolidarity of the Principality of Andorra.\r\nAs I have said, our dedication to the purposes \r\nand principles of the United Nations is clear and \r\nfirm. Secretary-General António Guterres can rely on \r\nAndorra to help build a sustainable, safe and fair world \r\nthat involves everyone, with no one left behind.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Head of Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Antoni Martí Petit, Head of Government of \r\nthe Principality of Andorra, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Hassan Ali Khayre, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Republic of Somalia\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Federal \r\nRepublic of Somalia.\r\nMr. Hassan Ali Khayre, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Republic of Somalia, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Hassan Ali Khayre, \r\nPrime Minister of the Federal Republic of Somalia, and \r\ninviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Khayre (Somalia): It is an honour to address \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nI bring warm greetings and good wishes from our \r\nPresident, His Excellency Mr. Mohamed Abdullahi \r\nMohamed Farmajo, and the entire Government and the \r\npeople of the Federal Republic of Somalia.\r\nAllow me first to congratulate the President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly on his assumption of his post and his \r\ncapable work in steering this organ towards a successful \r\nsession. Yesterday we observed the International Day \r\nof Peace, a day that calls for togetherness and solidarity \r\nwith those who have been forced to f lee their homes \r\nand those who leave home to seek a better life. The \r\ntheme of this year’s General Assembly session speaks \r\nof peace and a decent life on a sustainable planet. \r\nThe similarity in focus goes beyond coincidence to \r\nacknowledge that the pursuit of peace, a decent life, \r\nrespect, safety and dignity is a global need. Yet it is \r\nelusive for hundreds of millions of people in the world \r\ntoday. From Syria to the Central African Republic, \r\nfrom the Rohingya people of Myanmar to the people \r\nof Libya, the number of protracted and new conflicts \r\nremains unacceptably high.\r\nThe Somali people have for many years been the \r\nvictims of war, famine and poverty, which has seen \r\nsome of them displaced internally, while others made \r\nthe perilous journey abroad. We are therefore all too \r\nfamiliar with the need for others to open their doors \r\nto distraught and disillusioned people who, just like \r\nus, are seeking a safe and dignified life. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank all those who, even \r\nin challenging times, continue to uphold that spirit of \r\noneness, sharing and caring.\r\nSomalia is rising, and we are determined to stay the \r\ncourse. Our aim is to contribute positively to the progress \r\nof our region, our continent and the world. Despite \r\nthe enormous challenges, we are, among other things, \r\nimproving security, re-establishing law and order and \r\nconducting the necessary political and socioeconomic \r\nreforms. The progress we have achieved so far is the \r\nresult of our people’s embrace of a new dawn and our \r\nsteadfast partners’ willingness to continue supporting \r\nus on our journey towards peace and prosperity.\r\nWe will continue to formulate measures to \r\nstrengthen Somalia’s progress, including in revenue \r\ngeneration. However, we are dealing with some \r\nserious challenges beyond the control of the Somali \r\nGovernment. Debt relief would have the effect of \r\nunlocking concessional financing, attracting foreign \r\ninvestment and providing an opportunity that is critical \r\nto sustaining our reform efforts, and consequently \r\nreinvigorating our economy. We are already working \r\nwith international financial institutions towards that \r\nobjective and, through this forum, seek the support of \r\nthe international community.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 17/27\r\nTerrorism remains one of our pressing challenges. \r\nIts repercussions are felt around the globe. Our unity \r\nin addressing this scourge, both collectively and \r\nsustainably, is therefore critical. No effort should \r\nbe spared to neutralize the growth and influence of \r\ninternational terrorist organizations such as the Islamic \r\nState in Iraq and the Sham and Al-Qaida, which, as \r\nwe know, are key influencers of localized terrorism. \r\nEfforts to step up military interventions against such \r\ngroups should be redoubled. We in Somalia have made \r\nsignificant strides that have weakened the capability of \r\nAl-Shabaab.\r\nIn that regard, I would like to thank those participating \r\nin the African Union Mission in Somalia (AMISOM) \r\nfor their sacrifice, unfailing support, dedication and \r\nsolidarity in the fight against Al-Shabaab. In order to \r\nensure that such gains are sustainable, we are focused \r\non strengthening the military capacity of our national \r\nsecurity forces. However, the arms embargo imposed \r\non Somalia severely limits our ability to achieve that \r\nobjective. The Federal Government of Somalia will \r\ncontinue to work with the Security Council and relevant \r\nactors on our road map to get it lifted.\r\nPoverty and a lack of education and livelihood \r\nopportunities continue to contribute to the growth of \r\nviolent extremism. Across the world, disillusioned \r\nyoung people are at a heightened risk of exploitation \r\nby criminal networks, including terrorists. The need \r\nto invest in education, skill-building and livelihood \r\nopportunities for our youth is urgent. Addressing those \r\nkey strategic elements in order to counter terrorism is \r\nan enormous task that requires a holistic approach and \r\nresources to match. We continue to call on friends of \r\nSomalia to help us in such an important undertaking.\r\nWe cannot talk about a sustainable planet without \r\ndemonstrating a commitment to making the world \r\nlivable for ourselves and future generations. Somalia is \r\none of the countries that have been ravaged by a vicious \r\ncycle of man-made and natural disasters directly \r\ncreated by environmental degradation. Scarce rains \r\nlead to crop failure and the death of livestock, which \r\nsubsequently lead to drought and famine. Currently, \r\nthe humanitarian situation of millions of Somalis \r\nremains fragile, as the bite of the current drought, \r\nwhich still threatens to develop into famine, continues. \r\nOur national development plan outlines a clear and \r\nrealistic road map towards breaking that vicious \r\ncycle. However, Somalia and many other countries \r\nthat are on the receiving end of climate change have \r\nbeen unable to come up with the resources required to \r\ntackle this ever-growing problem. In that regard, we \r\nurge all Member States to continue improving the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change, which has the potential \r\nto mitigate the issue’s effects. Similarly, developing \r\ncountries like Somalia need investment in long-term \r\ninitiatives, including infrastructure development, water \r\nconservation, innovative food and livestock production \r\nand the creation of livelihood opportunities.\r\nWe must get better at streamlining global \r\ndevelopment and aid structures, especially for fragile \r\nStates. We must revisit the prevailing paradigms \r\nand take bold and innovative steps to improve that \r\narchitecture. The New Deal for Engagement in Fragile \r\nStates, adopted in South Korea in 2011, was certainly \r\na great step in that direction. Somalia fully embraced \r\nthe New Deal. Yet even with all of its strengths, the \r\nNew Deal needs improvement. That said, the principles \r\nof mutual accountability that are embedded in the \r\nframework are exactly what fragile countries like \r\nSomalia need. It often happens that pledges are made, \r\nonly to be later neglected. That should not be the \r\ncase, because fragile countries rely on such support to \r\nrebuild their States. Conversely, development partners \r\nare often frustrated with fragile countries’ weak \r\ntransparency and accountability institutions. That \r\nis a legitimate concern. As fragile nations, we must \r\ndo better by tackling corruption and plugging leaks. \r\nSomalia recently took bold steps to address corruption. \r\nOur anti-corruption bill, which is critical for putting in \r\nplace measures for good governance and accountability, \r\nhas been approved by my Cabinet and introduced \r\nfor enactment by Parliament. The leadership of my \r\ncountry has also reiterated its zero-tolerance policy \r\non corruption.\r\nAlso related to funding, we must find predictable \r\nfinancing for non-United Nations peacekeeping \r\nmissions. That is particularly true for AMISOM. \r\nAMISOM has registered tremendous success for more \r\nthan a decade, and yet each year it continues to operate \r\nwith uncertainty about its funding. We believe that \r\ninvestment in peacekeeping is a worthy investment \r\nin peacebuilding and State-building. We have seen \r\nthe dividends of such investment in Somalia. I look \r\nforward to engaging with our partners on that matter in \r\nthe coming weeks and months.\r\nA fundamental element of peacebuilding \r\nand State-building is how any country treats its \r\nmarginalized and voiceless citizens. Women are crucial \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n18/27 17-29722\r\nin decision-making and represent an investment in \r\nsociety. In spite of our many challenges, Somalia has \r\nmade significant steps in that regard. During the 2016 \r\nelection, the number of women in Parliament increased \r\nfrom 14 to 24 per cent of the total. Although we missed \r\nour target of 30 per cent, we have improved markedly \r\nfrom a few years ago.\r\nSix months ago, when I was forming my Council \r\nof Ministers, I appointed six women to my Cabinet. \r\nThey hold some of the most important portfolios in our \r\nnation, including in trade and industry, health, youth \r\nand sports, women and human rights and humanitarian \r\naffairs. Women have played an instrumental role in \r\nSomalia during our worst times. In addition to being \r\nmothers, wives and sisters, they dominate the informal \r\neconomy. Many living as refugees and migrants remain \r\nthe lifeline of their families through remittances sent \r\nto Somalia.\r\nSimilarly, young people are vital to peacebuilding \r\nand State-building. The number of youths in our \r\nParliament has increased exponentially. I have also \r\nappointed a number of very young people to key \r\nCabinet positions. Tragically, one of them, Mr. Abbas \r\nSiraji, was killed in May. He was a beacon of hope \r\nfor Somalia’s young people. Having grown up in \r\nKenya, in the world’s largest refugee camp, he worked \r\nhard, studied and worked for various United Nations \r\nagencies. I appointed him Minister of Public Works \r\nand Reconstruction when he was 31. Although he is no \r\nlonger with us, his appointment brought out the potential \r\nof thousands of young people across the country. He \r\nshowed them that life in the refugee camps, harsh as it \r\nwas, did not mean the end of hope.\r\nHuman rights is one of the core principles of the \r\nUnited Nations. We are working hard to ensure respect \r\nfor the human rights of all people. Our establishment \r\nof institutions such as our National Human Rights \r\nCommission, which is mandated to protect and \r\npromote human rights, will be a significant step in \r\nthat direction. Vital legislation on human rights, such \r\nas the soon-to-be-approved sexual offences bill, will \r\nprovide the tools to fight impunity for perpetrators of \r\nsexual crimes. However fond we are of our traditions, \r\nthat should never be a reason to condone impunity. My \r\nGovernment is determined to find ways to harmonize \r\nour traditional dispute-resolution approach and the \r\nconventional justice system in a manner that respects \r\nthe human rights of its people.\r\nThe United Nations continues to be the world’s \r\nmost important shared platform for nations to develop \r\nand strengthen bilateral and multilateral relations. It \r\nis a core United Nations principle for States to respect \r\none another’s political independence, sovereignty \r\nand territorial integrity. It is a principle that should \r\nbe promoted and upheld at all times, especially when \r\nengaging with fragile States, such as Somalia.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to take this opportunity \r\nto add my voice to those supporting reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Organization has worked for peace \r\nand stability for decades, and I strongly believe that the \r\nSecretary-General’s reform agenda will most certainly \r\nlead to a far more responsive and dynamic institution. \r\nAs a country that has greatly benefited from the United \r\nNations system, we have also seen that it can improve \r\nits overall efficiency.\r\nWith that, I would like to conclude by once again \r\nreminding all of us that we must redouble our efforts to \r\nfocus on peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable \r\nplanet. That will take collective recognition of the fact \r\nthat what happens in one corner of the world can affect \r\nthose in other corners, too.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Republic of Somalia for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Hassan Ali Khayre, Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Republic of Somalia, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, \r\nPrime Minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister of the Kingdom \r\nof Lesotho.\r\nMr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Thomas Motsoahae \r\nThabane, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Lesotho, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Thabane (Lesotho): Allow me to begin by \r\ncongratulating the President on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 19/27\r\nsecond session. His illustrious career as a diplomat gives \r\nus confidence that we will see a successful session, \r\nand I assure him of my delegation’s full support and \r\ncooperation during his tenure. Let me also commend \r\nhis predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his excellent \r\nleadership of the seventy-first session of the General \r\nAssembly. He handled that great responsibility very \r\nwell and with much skill and devotion.\r\nDuring the previous session, we also witnessed \r\nthe appointment of the new Secretary-General, \r\nMr. António Guterres, whose impeccable credentials \r\nand distinguished service within the United Nations, \r\ncoupled with his wealth of knowledge and experience, \r\nleave us hopeful that he will handle the challenges of his \r\nnew position with dexterity. We therefore congratulate \r\nhim on his well-deserved appointment and wish him \r\nsuccess in the long journey ahead. We also pay tribute \r\nto his predecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for a job well \r\ndone. He performed the duties of his high office with \r\nconsummate diplomatic skill and honour.\r\nWe meet once again for the seventy-second time in \r\nthe history of the United Nations in order to appraise \r\nthe world’s political, security and economic situations. \r\nWe do so at a critical juncture in human history. Now \r\nis the time for a true reflection on the role of the \r\nOrganization in the twenty-first century, since it is on \r\nthe United Nations that humankind places much faith \r\nand hope for a better life for all.\r\nThe pall of despair that descended on the world \r\nfollowing the Second World War was eased by our \r\nforebears’ adoption of lofty ideals when they came \r\ntogether in San Francisco and resolved\r\n“to save succeeding generations from the scourge \r\nof war;\r\n“to reaffirm faith in fundamental human rights, in \r\nthe dignity and worth of the human person, in the \r\nequal rights of men and women and of nations large \r\nand small, and;\r\n“to promote social progress and better standards of \r\nlife in larger freedom”.\r\nSadly, today we speak of a world that is slowly \r\nregressing to resembling the one that existed seven \r\ndecades ago. The multifaceted and complex challenges \r\nthat have besieged us are threatening to erode the \r\nlaudable strides that the United Nations has made \r\nsince its establishment. Inter- and intra-State conflict \r\ncharacterizes the modern-day world. From the global \r\nrefugee crisis to the spread of terrorism, the ability of \r\nthe United Nations to effectively resolve conflict is \r\nbeing put to the test. The heightened tensions on the \r\nKorean peninsula, coupled with the f lagrant violation \r\nthere of Security Council resolutions and the Treaty on \r\nthe Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, speak to the \r\narms race brewing in that part of the world.\r\nAs if that were not enough, respect for human \r\nrights and the rule of law — the principles that speak to \r\nthe very fibre of the United Nations — continues to be \r\nf louted with impunity. Women and children in particular \r\nface the worst forms of brutal abuse, especially in \r\nconflict-ridden countries. Poverty also continues to \r\nbe a dreadful aff liction for developing countries, \r\nundermining their efforts to re-orient their economies \r\ntowards significant gains in real growth. The result is \r\nthat most poverty-stricken populations are sometimes \r\nleft with no option but to employ unorthodox methods \r\nfor economic survival to sustain their livelihoods.\r\nIt is in that context that we welcome the theme for \r\nthis session: “Focusing on people: Striving for peace \r\nand a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. It \r\nresonates squarely with the principles that underpinned \r\nthe establishment of the United Nations. That is what \r\nthe Organization stands for. The complexities and \r\ndichotomies that characterize humankind’s existence \r\non the planet and the inequalities that prevail between \r\ndeveloped and underdeveloped countries would be a \r\nthing of the past if we could remain true to our mission \r\nand focus on people on our development path.\r\nWhile the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nembrace the concept of universal prosperity for \r\nall societies, we are all aware that, in essence, that \r\nideal is still far from being realized. We must move \r\nforward cooperatively in our efforts to achieve peace \r\nand a decent life for all. It is incumbent on the entire \r\ninternational community to act in unison as we strive \r\nto restore peace and deploy a universal response to our \r\ngoals. To that end, our immediate challenge is to come \r\nup with a new strategy that encapsulates the SDGs and \r\nmultidimensionally integrates them into the concept, as \r\nthe theme outlines.\r\nWe are cognizant of the fact that in Lesotho our \r\ndestiny is in our hands and that the chief responsibility \r\nfor sustainable and equal development resides with us. \r\nAs a newly inaugurated Administration, we have set \r\nfor ourselves the very lofty goal of restructuring all our \r\nimportant Government institutions. In that regard, we \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n20/27 17-29722\r\nintend to embark on an ambitious yet achievable reform \r\nprogramme. We are committed to fully implementing \r\nthe decisions of the Southern African Development \r\nCommunity (SADC) and putting Lesotho on a path \r\nof inclusive reform that will consist of constitutional, \r\nparliamentary, electoral, public-sector and security-\r\nsector reforms. It is an exercise that will involve all \r\nstakeholders, who must engage with genuine and total \r\ncommitment to establishing a stable political order that \r\nis conducive to economic development.\r\nAs the new Government of Lesotho, our resolve \r\nand commitment to implementing SADC decisions \r\nsignifies our commitment to working together with our \r\nregional body in pursuit of lasting peace and security in \r\nour country and the whole SADC region. We have made \r\ngood progress in the implementation of SADC decisions \r\nfollowing the recommendations of Justice Mpaphi \r\nPhumaphi, which were laid out during his enquiry in \r\nLesotho after the brutal assassination of Lieutenant \r\nGeneral Mahao, Lesotho’s Army Commander, in June \r\n2015. Today I have to once again report to the Assembly \r\nwith sadness and great humiliation the assassination \r\nof the current Army Commander, Lieutenant General \r\nKhoantle Motsomotso, less than three weeks ago, on \r\n5 September, by two senior army officers, who were \r\nin turn shot and killed by the General’s bodyguards. \r\nDespite such daunting challenges to our small mountain \r\nKingdom’s political and security instability, SADC is \r\nstanding firmly behind us as a regional bloc to help \r\nrestore peace, political stability, security and the rule \r\nof law in Lesotho.\r\nOn that note, I wantto thank SADC, our development \r\npartners, the Friends of Lesotho, the African Union \r\nand the United Nations for their unwavering support in \r\nensuring that Lesotho’s democracy is protected in its \r\npursuit of economic growth and stability.\r\nOn the development front, I am happy to report \r\nthat the Government of Lesotho is committed to \r\nmaintaining fiscal discipline in order to stabilize the \r\nnational economy and stimulate growth and business \r\nactivity while preserving the environment. At the same \r\ntime, we are relentlessly committed to combating crime \r\nand corruption at all levels of our society, in accordance \r\nwith SDG 16, which recognizes that corruption \r\nundermines efforts to combat poverty and gender \r\nequality. It further acts as a tax on the poor when it \r\ncomes to accessing their right to public services. We \r\nare aware that on our own, without the support of our \r\ncooperating partners, our efforts to root out corruption \r\ncannot yield the desired results; hence our urgent call to \r\nthem to join forces with us in our crusade.\r\nAs a least developed country, we believe that the \r\nconcept of development is meaningful only when it \r\ngives communities tangible benefits in a sustainable \r\nmanner. It is indisputable fact that young people are the \r\nthread that holds together the fabric of every nation and \r\nthat at the same time they can be major agents of change. \r\nIt would be a serious and unwise miscalculation not to \r\nrecognize them as our partners of today and leaders of \r\ntomorrow. In that regard, we emphasize the importance \r\nof young people’s participation in decision-making at \r\nall levels. Job creation for young people also remains a \r\npriority. With reference to SDG 8, our global strategy \r\nfor youth employment is set to be operationalized by \r\n2020. Countries therefore have to develop strategies \r\nfor youth employment and implement the Global Jobs \r\nPact of the International Labour Organization. In that \r\nregard, the Government of Lesotho remains committed \r\nin its resolve to harness the energy of young Basotho \r\nmen and women in order to further the advancement of \r\nthe economy of our country.\r\nLesotho continues to deal with the scourge of \r\nthe HIV/AIDS pandemic, which is more prevalent \r\namong young women, who are the backbone of our \r\neconomy. The empowerment of women is a focus of our \r\ndevelopment policy. We believe that elevating them to \r\npositions of leadership in both the private and public \r\nsectors will lead to a more equitable and prosperous \r\nsociety in Lesotho. We recognize that poverty and \r\nthe AIDS pandemic go hand in hand, and our poverty \r\neradication policies therefore target the most vulnerable \r\ngroups, including the elderly, AIDS orphans, women \r\nand young people. We remain committed to ensuring \r\nthat those objectives are tackled, for they are key \r\ncomponents of the SDGs.\r\nOn the economic front, like other landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries, Lesotho continues to face \r\nchallenges inherently linked to its unique geographic \r\nposition. The burden of high transport costs and \r\ncumbersome and slow export processing procedures \r\ncontinues to impose serious impediments to our \r\nexternal trade. I must therefore mention the need for \r\nincreased international assistance in infrastructure \r\ndevelopment and institutional capacity-building, as \r\nwell as industrialization and enhancement of productive \r\ncapacity, for all developing countries, not only the least \r\ndeveloped.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 21/27\r\nLesotho continues to support the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security. We are deeply \r\ndisturbed by the ongoing violence in Syria and other \r\nparts of the Middle East. The rise of the Islamic State in \r\nIraq and the Levant (ISIL) has added another dimension \r\nto the scourge of international terrorism. It has become \r\na force of destruction and generates mayhem on a \r\nglobal scale. We are encouraged by recent efforts aimed \r\nat shrinking the boundaries of the territories controlled \r\nby ISIL in Iraq and Syria. As a result of the ongoing \r\nviolence in the Middle East and elsewhere, the world’s \r\nrefugee population has grown; there are more than \r\n65 million displaced persons, including those f leeing \r\nhunger. That situation is intolerable, as it has created \r\nan environment in which young people have become \r\nvulnerable to recruitment by terrorist movements and \r\nhuman trafficking.\r\nIn recent years, Lesotho has faced prolonged \r\ndroughts due to the El Niño effect, which crippled the \r\nentire Southern African subcontinent and led to food \r\nshortages and other hardships. The recent hurricanes \r\nthat have devastated the Caribbean and parts of the \r\nUnited States, along with the torrential rains that have \r\nbeen witnessed in many countries, including f loods of \r\nbiblical proportions, are a stark reminder that climate \r\nchange is with us and that urgent action is required \r\nin accordance with the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, which was concluded more than a year ago.\r\nWe reiterate our appeal that small countries such \r\nas Lesotho, including small island States, should be \r\nempowered with technologies for dealing with and \r\nadapting to climate-change challenges. Sustainable \r\ndevelopment will elude us without genuine commitment \r\non the part of all, including our development \r\npartners. The principles of common but differentiated \r\nresponsibility and economic might and capability \r\nbetween developed and developing nations will be \r\ncritical to our success in building a sustainable world. \r\nWe therefore call on the international community to \r\ncontinue mobilizing and providing additional financial \r\nresources to Africa for climate-friendly technologies to \r\naddress both the urgent adaptation and mitigation needs \r\nof Africa and other developing countries. Similarly, we \r\nurge countries that have reneged on their support to the \r\nParis Agreement to reconsider their position and return \r\nto the fold.\r\nThe eradication of colonialism is one of the most \r\nnotable achievements accomplished by the international \r\ncommunity through the United Nations. However, \r\nthat business remains unfinished. The questions of \r\nWestern Sahara and Palestine have defied solutions for \r\na long time.\r\nWe reiterate our support for Western Sahara in its \r\nstruggle for self-determination. Every day that passes \r\nwithout a change in the lives of the people of Western \r\nSahara is a reminder to the world that we must renew \r\nour determination to fight the injustices perpetrated \r\nagainst the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic. \r\nHistory will judge us harshly if we watch in silence \r\nas unjust treatment is meted out to the people of that \r\nAfrican country. Our silence and inaction will leave an \r\nindelible mark of failure on our collective character. In \r\nthe modern world the use of colonial tactics is totally \r\nunacceptable. In that connection, we call on the United \r\nNations to remain resolute in its determination to rid \r\nthe world of the scourge of colonialism. The agreement \r\nby the POLISARIO Front and Morocco to resume \r\nnegotiations in order to reach a long-term solution has \r\nnot gone unnoticed. We commend them for that bold step \r\nand assure them of our support in that noble endeavour.\r\nThe question of Palestine has been on the United \r\nNations agenda for decades. We continue to believe \r\nthat a two-State solution, based on the 1967 borders, \r\nwhereby Israel and Palestine coexist side-by-side in \r\nequal sovereignty, is the most viable proposal for a \r\npermanent settlement to that vexing problem. The \r\nPalestinians too deserve to enjoy the right to peace, \r\ndevelopment and the sanctity of life.\r\nConcerning the nuclear-disarmament landscape, \r\nthe United Nations made significant progress a few \r\nmonths ago with the adoption of the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons as the first legally \r\nbinding international agreement to comprehensively \r\nprohibit nuclear weapons with the goal of eventually \r\nachieving their total elimination. That is a historic \r\nachievement, especially in the light of the ongoing \r\ntensions in the Korean peninsula. The argument that \r\nnuclear weapons are a deterrent is a fallacy. Such \r\nweapons are a threat to human existence, and their \r\npossessors should do the right thing and renounce them \r\nin line with their international obligations. The Treaty \r\nshould not remain a mere paper agreement; it must be \r\nratified and implemented by all.\r\nAs I conclude, I would like to point out that we \r\nshould continue to resist all attempts to undermine \r\nthe global consensus that the United Nations has built \r\naround many issues of importance to our peoples. We \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n22/27 17-29722\r\nremain convinced that it is the only universal institution \r\nthat can safeguard world peace and ensure the survival \r\nof all and sundry. For it to do so, however, the reform \r\nagenda of the United Nations must proceed without \r\nfurther delay, including reform of the Security Council. \r\nA Council that is transparent and representative of all \r\nregions, including Africa, will go a long way to fulfilling \r\nthe ideals for which the United Nations was founded. \r\nUnilateral actions that defy civility and international \r\nlaw belong to the past. Let us march forward with unity \r\nof purpose, while focusing on our peoples and striving \r\nfor peace so that we can all have a decent life.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nKingdom of Lesotho for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Thomas Motsoahae Thabane, Prime Minister \r\nof the Kingdom of Lesotho, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Sir Louis Straker, Deputy Prime Minister \r\nand Minister for Foreign Affairs, International \r\nTrade and Regional Integration of Saint Vincent and \r\nthe Grenadines.\r\nSir Louis (Saint Vincent and the Grenadines): \r\nOur Organization was founded amid the still glowing \r\nembers and simmering tensions of global war. In the \r\nshadows of widespread death and destruction, the \r\nnations of the world united in recognition of the fact \r\nthat global challenges can be overcome only through \r\ncollective action and international law, not misguided \r\nunilateralism or short-sighted self-interest. That \r\nrecognition remains as valid today as it was 72 years \r\nago, even as new threats to life and development have \r\njoined armed conflict as challenges demanding a \r\nconcerted international response.\r\nOn behalf of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, \r\nI would like to express our stand in solidarity with \r\nthe Government and the people of Mexico as they \r\nare suffering the devastating effects of yet another \r\nearthquake. As I speak before the Assembly today, the \r\nisland of Dominica has been levelled by a direct hit from \r\nHurricane Maria, even as it was continuing to recover \r\nfrom the widespread devastation wrought by Tropical \r\nStorm Erika two years ago. No individual there has \r\nbeen spared. A series of hurricanes — Harvey, Irma, \r\nJose, and Maria — of unprecedented intensity have \r\nstruck the peoples of our region with unerring accuracy \r\nand rapidity.\r\nThe States and territories affected include the United \r\nStates, Antigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Dominica, \r\nCuba, Saint Kitts and Nevis, the Bahamas, the British \r\nVirgin Islands, the United States Virgin Islands, Saint \r\nMartin, Puerto Rico and, today, the Turks and Caicos \r\nIslands. In a period of five weeks, each of those countries \r\nand territories has been struck with a force comparable \r\nto that of a weapon of mass destruction. Hundreds of \r\npeople are dead. The damage to infrastructure, while \r\nstill being calculated, is already estimated at more than \r\n$130 billion. The current Atlantic hurricane season is \r\nlikely to be the most expensive in history. In terms of \r\ndevelopment, the countries affected will take years, if \r\nnot decades, to recover from the devastating battering.\r\nLet us make no mistake: the death and destruction \r\nwrought by this hurricane season are not merely the \r\nresult of freak weather events or vengeful acts of God. \r\nThey are the direct result of the acts and omissions of \r\nhumankind. They are manifestations of climate change \r\nand the symptoms of the prescient predictions made by \r\nthe overwhelming majority of scientists. Today almost \r\nevery year is hotter than the preceding one; almost \r\nevery hurricane season more intense; and almost every \r\nstorm, drought and f lood more destructive than its \r\npredecessors. It is a barefaced insult to the intelligence \r\nand experience of the peoples of island States and \r\ncoastal areas to call climate change a hoax.\r\nAt this point, it is almost a cliché to reaffirm that \r\nsmall island developing States are the most vulnerable \r\nto climate change while contributing the least to the \r\nemissions that cause it. But that truism is the foundation \r\nof our just, urgent and unavoidable demand that the \r\nnations that have contributed most to climate change \r\nshould also do the most to mitigate its effects and assist \r\nothers in adapting to our dangerous new realities.\r\nOur global community, in the great tradition of \r\nthe United Nations and in the spirit of the founders of \r\nthis Organization, came together through hard-fought \r\nnegotiations to craft the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange, an ambitious if imperfect agreement designed \r\nto arrest climate change and assist those most affected \r\nby it. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines views any \r\nattempt to disavow the freshly minted commitments of \r\nthe Paris Agreement as an act of hostility, and we draw \r\na direct, causal connection between any such abdication \r\nand the future death and destruction that island States \r\nface as the result of increasingly frequent and intense \r\nweather events.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 23/27\r\nThe independent countries of Antigua and \r\nBarbuda, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Cuba, the Bahamas \r\nand Dominica require the special and sustained support \r\nof the international community. These countries need \r\nimmediate and massive assistance with both immediate \r\nrelief and long-term reconstruction. That assistance \r\nshould be concessional and free from antiquated notions \r\nof per capita gross domestic product. We therefore join \r\nother countries in calling for a donor conference to \r\naddress the daunting challenges that those countries \r\nface. Only together can we recover.\r\nAdditionally, the Caribbean territories with special \r\nrelationships to colonial Powers in the United States, \r\nthe United Kingdom, France and the Netherlands are in \r\ndesperate need of assistance and have limited options for \r\ninternational cooperation, given their unique political \r\nstatus. Despite our small size and limited means, the \r\npeople of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have already \r\nsent emergency assistance to these territories, as well \r\nas technical expertise. We urge administering Powers \r\nand potential donors alike to look past political issues \r\nand look instead to the needs of the affected peoples \r\nand communities. We also call on the colonial Powers \r\nto accept their full responsibility for the recovery and \r\nrehabilitation of these territories.\r\nThe rise of climate change as an existential threat \r\nof our era has not replaced the persistent peril of armed \r\nconflict across the globe. The human suffering in Syria, \r\nYemen and Myanmar demands greater international \r\nattention and action. Similarly, the potential threats \r\nto international peace and security posed by tensions \r\non the Korean peninsula, among the Gulf States \r\nand in the State of Palestine require persistent and \r\nprioritized diplomacy.\r\nDiplomacy, though difficult, is always preferable \r\nto the alternative. The United Nations was founded \r\nand continues to exist on that fundamental premise. \r\nFrustration with the pace of negotiation and mediation \r\ncannot give way to the intemperate urge to impose quick \r\nmilitary fixes on inherently political problems. Nor can \r\nit lead to an illogical interpretation of sovereign self-\r\ninterest that justifies trampling on the sovereignty of \r\nother States.\r\nSovereignty is not a sword but a shield. The United \r\nNations is not a forum for measuring whose sovereignty \r\nis bigger, or whose military is better equipped to \r\npursue its narrow, short-term self-interest. We are a \r\ncommunity founded instead on the assumption of the \r\nsovereign equality of all States, rich and poor, large \r\nand small. One nation’s ability to destroy another does \r\nnot endow it with special rights, but rather profound \r\nresponsibilities, chief among them restraint. President \r\nTheodore Roosevelt’s realpolitik adage of speaking \r\nsoftly while carrying a big stick — whatever its \r\nlimitations — cannot be replaced by irresponsible, \r\nbellicose sabre-rattling that inches us closer to the types \r\nof conflict that the Assembly was created to prevent.\r\nIn that context. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nviews with alarm the continued threats to the \r\nsovereignty of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela. \r\nTo be sure, the people of Venezuela have endured \r\nan extended period of political conflict, which has \r\nexacerbated other difficulties in the country. But with \r\nillegal street violence dwindling and all political parties \r\ncommitted to the upcoming gubernatorial elections, \r\nthe interventionist option increasingly f loated by the \r\nUnited States and an imprudent Secretary General of \r\nthe Organization of American States have no place in a \r\nmodern Latin America.\r\nSimilarly, any threat, expressed or implied, to the \r\nsovereignty of the peaceful and noble Cuban people \r\nis an anachronistic throwback to Cold War posturing \r\nwithout any logical justification, particularly in the \r\nlight of the recent détente between the Governments of \r\nCuba and the United States.\r\nLet us be clear. Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nis a zone of peace. There is no conflict, challenge or \r\ndisagreement in our region that requires military \r\nintervention in any way, shape or form, be it covert, \r\novert or by proxy. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines \r\nis resolutely and implacably opposed to any attempt \r\nto foment external interference or interventionist \r\nactivities against any nation in our hemisphere.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines was honoured \r\nto host the 2017 Caribbean regional seminar on \r\ndecolonization, consistent with our responsibilities as \r\none of the many Caribbean and Pacific small island \r\nStates and former colonies in Africa and Asia whose \r\nself-determination was achieved under the watchful eye \r\nof the United Nations. The inconvenient truth is that \r\nthe decolonization process remains incomplete, and it \r\nwill be essential to intensify our efforts to achieve the \r\ngoal of full self-government through the attainment of a \r\nlegitimate political status option providing for absolute \r\npolitical equality. That principle must be the guiding \r\nstandard applicable to the small island territories, just \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n24/27 17-29722\r\nas it was the standard for decolonizing other former \r\ncolonies. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines remains \r\nfully seized of this issue and was pleased to play its part \r\nin completing the unfinished business of decolonization \r\nby hosting the 2017 seminar and previous seminars in \r\n2011 and 2005. It is in that spirit that we have great \r\nsympathy for the legitimate aspiration of the people \r\nof West Papua to freedom and independence and to \r\ngovern themselves and guide their own destiny through \r\nlegitimate political means.\r\nThe issue of United Nations reform has justifiably \r\ngained momentum in recent months. As a large, aging \r\nbureaucracy, the United Nations has not demonstrated \r\nthe nimbleness and responsiveness it needs for our new \r\nand fast-paced modern challenges. However, the areas \r\ndemanding the most immediate and far-reaching reforms \r\nare not budgetary allocations or staffing matters but \r\nrather the political and organizational underpinnings of \r\nthe most fossilized structures of the United Nations and \r\nthe wider international architecture.\r\nThe litmus test for any serious talk of United \r\nNations reform is reform of the Security Council. \r\nThose who pay lip service to reform while ignoring \r\nthe need for a reformed Council — with expanded \r\npermanent membership, a special voice for island States \r\nand radically revised working methods — are simply \r\nengaging in an exercise where they attempt to reduce \r\ntheir financial responsibilities while maintaining an \r\nunjustifiable grip on disproportionate and outmoded \r\npower arrangements.\r\nSimilarly, the lessons of the global economic \r\nand financial crisis have yet to be implemented. Our \r\ninactivity has produced an extended period of halting \r\nand uneven recovery and an iniquitous globalization \r\nwhose unequal distribution of benefits and burdens is \r\nspurring a popular backlash worldwide. The General \r\nAssembly and the Economic and Social Council \r\nmust squarely and frontally address reforms to our \r\ninternational financial architecture, in particular the \r\nBretton Woods institutions.\r\nFor Caribbean States, the issue of declining \r\ncorrespondent banking relationships is a grave and \r\ngathering threat to our continued growth and ongoing \r\nconnections to the global economy. The United Nations, \r\nthe Group of 20 and international financial institutions \r\ncannot shirk this issue as a private banking matter. It \r\nis a threat to development of the highest priority, and it \r\ndemands a coordinated, political solution.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines applauds the \r\nPresident’s sustained focus on sustainable development. \r\nOur Government has located the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) at the centre of its national \r\ndevelopment strategies. In the areas of climate change, \r\npollution and biodiversity, we have banned Styrofoam \r\nproducts and turtle-hunting, tightened restrictions on \r\ninternationally permitted indigenous whaling activity \r\nand implemented new coastal protection regulations. \r\nWe are investing heavily in geothermal and solar energy \r\nand expect to generate 80 per cent of our energy needs \r\nfrom renewable sources within the next three years.\r\nSaint Vincent and the Grenadines is also dedicating \r\nspecial funding to technology-based entrepreneurs, \r\nimproving wages and occupational health and safety \r\nlegislation and investing in new modem medical \r\nfacilities. We have launched an innovative zero-hunger \r\nfund with interventions targeting food insecurity \r\nand unemployment in vulnerable populations, while \r\nsimultaneously creating a contingency fund to aid in \r\ndisaster recovery efforts.\r\nWe are serious and committed to the achievement \r\nof all the SDGs by the year 2030. Nonetheless, as the \r\nPresident and the Secretary-General have recognized, \r\nthe achievement of the SDGs requires international \r\ncooperation and the commitment of new and additional \r\nfunding. Ours is the only body that can generate and \r\nsustain the necessary political will and resources to \r\ngive life to the ambition of the SDGs. The link between \r\ndevelopment and peace is well established, and the link \r\nbetween peace and the United Nations is immutable.\r\nA substantial part of the backdrop or context of \r\nthe continuing socioeconomic challenges of the nation \r\nStates of our Caribbean civilization is the awful legacy \r\nof underdevelopment that European colonialism has \r\nbequeathed to us as a consequence of native genocide \r\nand African slavery. The international campaign \r\nfor reparations from the former colonial Powers in \r\norder to assist in repairing this malignant legacy is \r\nurgent and timely. It deserves the full support of the \r\nAssembly, particularly within this decade which has \r\nbeen declared to be focused on the uplifting of persons \r\nof African descent.\r\nI repeat yet again the necessity and desirability \r\nfor the responsible authorities in the Dominican \r\nRepublic and the United Nations to address properly, \r\nand once and for all, the respective issues of the denial \r\nof citizenship for persons of Haitian descent in the \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 25/27\r\nDominican Republic and the cholera epidemic that \r\nsome United Nations troops in Haiti initiated.\r\nIn the quest for deepening multilateralism, \r\ninternational cooperation and peace, the glaring injustice \r\nof the continuing denial of Taiwan’s membership in \r\nthe special agencies of the United Nations demands \r\ncorrection. The ghosts of a divisive past ought to be \r\nlaid to rest. Taiwan’s legitimate incorporation into the \r\nfamily of nations is long overdue. How can we neglect \r\nor deny 23 billion people who have been contributing \r\nso much to developing countries in every sector of their \r\neconomy? How can we deny them entrance into the \r\norgans of the United Nations? It is unfair and unjust \r\nand should be remedied.\r\nThe President took the Chair.\r\nThe travails of the people of Palestine arising from \r\nthe illegal occupation of their lands continue to haunt \r\nus globally. The General Assembly has repeatedly \r\npronounced in favour of the rights of the Palestinian \r\npeople, but the illegal occupiers, backed internationally \r\nby a handful of powerful States, have continued to \r\nthwart the will of the international community. Peace \r\nin the Middle East will remain a mirage unless the \r\nnational rights of the Palestinian people are recognized \r\nand upheld in practice.\r\nAs we speak in this Hall today, we seek to amplify \r\nthe echoes of the visionaries of yesteryear who stood at \r\nthis rostrum to give voice to the system of multilateral \r\ncooperation and mutual respect that has defined our \r\npost-war existence. New challenges may arise, but the \r\nsolutions — diplomacy, ambitious action and respect \r\nfor the sovereign equality of all Member States — are \r\neternal. Multilateral diplomacy may be messy and \r\nimperfect; international law may be frustratingly \r\ninconsistent; the path of development may be beset \r\non all sides by natural and man-made obstacles; but, \r\nunited, we have always been greater than the sum of our \r\nindividual parts, and together there is no challenge too \r\ngreat for the collective wisdom of our great nations and \r\nour great institution.\r\nAs new challenges confront us, let us hew ever \r\ncloser to the undeniable strengths of our Organization \r\nto make this a better world for all of us.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Prak Sokhonn, Senior Minister and Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nKingdom of Cambodia.\r\nMr. Sokhonn (Cambodia): On behalf of the Royal \r\nGovernment of Cambodia and on my own behalf, \r\nI congratulate you, Mr. Lajčák, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession. I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\nthank your predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson of Fiji. \r\nfor his commitment and dedication to the work of the \r\nprevious session.\r\nI join previous speakers in expressing my deepest \r\ncondolences and sympathy to the victims of the \r\nearthquake in Mexico and their families.\r\nMy delegation finds the theme of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly extremely relevant. It appropriately \r\nsums up the six overarching priorities of the presidency, \r\nwhich respond to the global megatrends currently \r\nfacing our world. The interaction between population \r\ngrowth, massive migration movement, climate change \r\nand food insecurity renders these megatrends all the \r\nmore worrisome.\r\nSimilarly, the same forces of globalization that \r\nin the past have made us so interdependent are \r\nexposing deep f laws in the existing international \r\norder. A quarter century after the end of the Cold \r\nWar, the world has become, by many measures, more \r\ncomplex and challenging than ever before. Today, \r\nour world is increasingly multipolar, which creates \r\nchaos and turbulence as the competition between the \r\nmajor Powers becomes more confrontational. We are \r\nmore interdependent but more unequal; we are more \r\nprosperous and yet millions are still aff licted with \r\npoverty. All these factors have contributed to a sense \r\nof a world out of balance, and that is the paradox that \r\ndefines our world today.\r\nWhile we share the deep concern about the \r\nsituation on the Korean peninsula, we appeal to all \r\nthe parties concerned to exercise the utmost restraint \r\nto avoid provocative activities and remain committed \r\nto peaceful and constructive dialogue so as to defuse \r\ntension and promote trust and confidence in the region.\r\nAnother factor destabilizing collective security is \r\nthe unilateral and illegal embargo on Cuba. We ask that \r\nthis violation of international law be brought to an end.\r\nWhile it is true that globalization and technological \r\nprogress have dramatically increased global trade and \r\nwealth all over the world, it is equally true that they \r\nhave been factors in the increases we are seeing in \r\ninequality, social tensions and, sometimes, conflicts. \r\nA/72/PV.17 22/09/2017\r\n26/27 17-29722\r\nTo a large extent, those fragilities are responsible for \r\nmany of today’s conflicts and threats.\r\nOne of those threats is terrorism, from which no \r\ncountry is spared. Defeating that transnational threat \r\nrequires a firm global resolve to comprehensively \r\naddress it in all its forms, starting with the symptoms \r\nand root causes of radicalization and confronting the \r\nissues of foreign fighters and financing for terrorism \r\nand other forms of support.\r\nLet me touch on two topics of relevance to the \r\ntheme of this session of the General Assembly, the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and \r\nclimate change.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda is inextricably linked to many \r\nof the issues that perturb the world today, the most \r\npressing being climate change, which is not only a direct \r\nthreat in itself but is also a multiplier of many other \r\nthreats — from poverty, diseases and food insecurity \r\nto mass migrations and regional conflicts. In our view, \r\nclimate change is a global human security issue that \r\npresents a serious and unprecedented threat to global \r\npeace and security more generally.\r\nCambodia is regularly ranked among the top 10 \r\nmost vulnerable countries globally, with extreme \r\nweather events damaging our infrastructure, severely \r\naffecting agriculture, disrupting economic activities \r\nand hampering crucial social services for our vulnerable \r\ngroups. While our contribution to climate change is \r\nnegligible and our domestic resources quite limited, \r\nwe have nonetheless made clear commitments to low-\r\ncarbon development and look forward to developing \r\npartnerships with other progressive nations that are \r\ncommitted to addressing this formidable challenge \r\ncooperatively and fairly. I am pleased to note that the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change acknowledges the \r\nprinciple of common but differentiated responsibilities, \r\nmeaning that they are based on countries’ respective \r\ncapabilities and varying national conditions. Indeed, \r\nthe 2030 Agenda is our boldest agenda for humankind \r\nand it is aimed at fostering fair globalization.\r\nCambodia has demonstrated its commitment to \r\nsustainable development over the past two decades. \r\nSpecifically, our target of reducing the poverty rate to \r\n19.5 per cent by 2015 was achieved ahead of schedule. \r\nWe have received a United Nations award for halving \r\nhunger before the deadline. Cambodia is also among the \r\ntop seven performers globally for its improvements in \r\nthe Human Development Index between 1990 and 2015.\r\nWith regard to peace and security, Cambodia \r\nis proud of its unwavering commitment to United \r\nNations peacekeeping efforts. More than two decades \r\nago Cambodia received United Nations Blue Berets \r\ndeployed on their peacekeeping mission. Since 2006, \r\nwe have dispatched more than 4,700 troops to take part \r\nwith great and commendable success in United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions in a number of hotspots in the \r\nworld, such as the Sudan, South Sudan, Lebanon, the \r\nCentral African Republic, Chad, Syria and Mali.\r\nAs all delegations know, peacekeeping operations \r\nare not without security risks. Peacekeepers continue to \r\ncome under attack from armed groups and increasingly \r\nfrom terrorists. In May, rebel ambushes in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic killed and wounded our Cambodian \r\npeacekeepers. Let us pay tribute to those who have \r\ndied while serving under the United Nations f lag and \r\nremind ourselves to acknowledge their contributions in \r\nthe transformation of many countries from battlefields \r\nto peaceful States.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nI now wish to address the issues of human rights \r\nand democracy, since my country is regularly targeted \r\nin that regard by some countries and United Nations \r\nagencies, as well as by international non-governmental \r\norganizations active in these areas.\r\nCambodia upholds the universal principle that we \r\nall possess fundamental human rights. We therefore \r\nsee no incompatibility between national sovereignty, \r\nas enshrined in the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nand international monitoring of the application of \r\nthose rights, provided that it is impartial and takes all \r\npertinent factors on the ground into account, and that \r\nobservers harbour no prejudice or prejudgement against \r\ndemocratically elected authorities.\r\nNow, what is the reality? To get straight to the point, \r\nassessments of human rights situations vary according \r\nto the political predispositions of certain great Powers. \r\nThe same reasoning holds true for some big international \r\nnon-governmental organizations whose agendas are far \r\nfrom politically neutral. The issue of human rights and \r\ndemocracy comes up only when the specific interests \r\nof certain major Powers are at stake, depending on the \r\nvagaries of the moment. Otherwise, all we hear is total \r\nand often complicit silence.\r\nMy country suffered from the deliberate political \r\ninstrumentalization of human rights and democracy for \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.17\r\n17-29722 27/27\r\nmore than 12 years, during which time the international \r\ncommunity denied the existence of the most terrible \r\nmass crimes. Today, as a survivor of the genocidal Pol \r\nPot regime, I am pained and shocked to hear the Special \r\nRapporteur on the situation of human rights in Cambodia \r\nrefer to the crimes perpetrated by that regime as mere \r\ndisturbances. We are subject to incessant criticism \r\non matters that are reported in a partial and biased \r\nmanner. Those reports always blame the Government \r\nand portray the opposition as martyrs of democracy \r\nand human rights. They invariably and exclusively \r\ntarget the Government, while the wrongdoings and \r\nillegal behaviour of the opposition are never or rarely \r\nmentioned.\r\nWhat country represented in the General Assembly \r\nwould refrain from acting when opposition politicians \r\nincite people to remove border posts, ignite vile \r\nhysteria with racist remarks and publish false treaties \r\nand fake maps to make people believe that some parts \r\nof the country have been annexed by neighbouring \r\nStates? What country endorses defamation and \r\nslander? In most countries, incitements to racial hatred, \r\nxenophobic statements and speeches of the extreme \r\nright are severely denounced or even condemned, as we \r\nhave just seen with the events of Charlottesville. While \r\nsuch actions are the daily language of the Cambodian \r\nopposition, they have never been condemned or raised \r\nby non-governmental organizations or the United \r\nNations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human \r\nrights in Cambodia.\r\nThe latest attacks on the Royal Government of \r\nCambodia pertain to the expulsion of an institute \r\naffiliated with a foreign political party that, under the \r\ncover of democracy training, deliberately supports \r\nthe opposition and violates our law; the closure of a \r\ntax delinquent foreign newspaper; and the arrest of \r\nan opposition leader who, in a recorded interview, \r\nconfessed to being an agent of a major Power working \r\nto overthrow the Government. In what country would \r\nsuch behaviour by a foreign Government be tolerated? \r\nWe have not acted arbitrarily but rather completely in \r\naccord with provisions of our specific laws.\r\nWe can learn an important lesson from the history \r\nof my country. When we were forced to choose a path set \r\nby some Western Powers, Cambodia ended up suffering \r\none of the most horrific human tragedies of the last \r\ncentury. We must recognize that it was the Cambodian \r\nGovernment, under the leadership of Prime Minister \r\nHun Sen and with its own homegrown methods, that \r\nsecured peace for the country in 1998. It was a striking \r\ndemonstration of the fact that certain practices imposed \r\nfrom the outside are often part of the problem rather \r\nthan the solution.\r\nToday we are accused of undermining democracy \r\nbecause, under existing laws, we are prosecuting \r\nand punishing people who violate the law. Those \r\nwho criticize or even threaten us refuse to take into \r\nconsideration the crimes committed by those whom \r\nthey protect.\r\nWhile acknowledging with sincere gratitude the \r\nvery positive and important contributions of many \r\ncountries to peace and economic development in our \r\ncountry, I would like to conclude by affirming that the \r\ndiscourse of certain Governments concerning human \r\nrights and democracy will be relevant and credible \r\nonly when those countries first apply to themselves \r\nthe same standards of treatment that they apply to their \r\nassessments, criticisms and condemnations of others.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.05 p.m.\r\n"
