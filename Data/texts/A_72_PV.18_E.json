"United Nations A/72/PV.18\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n18th plenary meeting\r\nFriday, 22 September 2017, 6.05 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.05 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Wilfred Elrington, Attorney General and Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Belize.\r\nMr. Elrington (Belize): On behalf of the Government \r\nand the people of Belize, I extend our heartfelt \r\ncondolences to the populations of our sister countries \r\nin the Caribbean for the destruction and loss of life and \r\nproperty caused by Hurricanes Irma and Maria. Belize \r\nstands united with other friendly countries of the world \r\nto assist and to render our full support to our sister \r\ncountries and friends in the Caribbean Community \r\n(CARICOM). I also extend Belize’s warmest feelings \r\nof solidarity and sympathy to the people of Mexico, our \r\nimmediate neighbours to the north, as they commence \r\na difficult recovery process following the death and \r\ndestruction caused by the two recent earthquakes.\r\nAs you observed in your opening statement \r\n(see A/72/PV.3), Mr. President, you have assumed \r\nthe presidency of the General Assembly at a most \r\nchallenging time for multilateralism. Be assured \r\nnonetheless that my Government and people have every \r\nconfidence in your leadership, and I pledge to you our \r\nfull and active support as you embark on the task of \r\naddressing the agenda of the seventy-second session of \r\nthe Assembly, focusing on people and striving for peace \r\nand a decent life for all on a sustainable planet.\r\nWith regard to the Belizean experience, Belize \r\ncelebrated its thirty-sixth year of independence on \r\n21 September. In the 36 years since independence, \r\nwe have matured into a unified nation, embracing \r\nall peoples in the fabric of our society and enjoying \r\na peaceful existence. We have worked assiduously to \r\nuplift every Belizean, especially those who have been \r\nvictims of anachronistic prejudices, and we have done \r\nso with an eye to ensuring that successive generations \r\ncan benefit from the fruits of our labours and our \r\nnatural resources. Our development has been modest in \r\nrelative terms, but progressive and steady.\r\nWe have readily embraced the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development and launched our Growth and \r\nSustainable Development Strategy for Belize 2016-2019, \r\nwhich incorporates the global Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs). Our nationally determined contributions \r\nunder the Paris Agreement further complement the \r\nSDGs. We are already seeing the dividends of that \r\nearly investment in policy and action. Belize has met \r\nseveral goals on road safety, marine protection and \r\nsustainable fisheries.\r\nThese early accomplishments are mere benchmarks. \r\nWe know that for our sustainable development, we \r\nmust go above and beyond such accomplishments, \r\nso my Government is setting even more ambitious \r\ntargets. At the Ocean Conference, we announced our \r\ncommitment to further strengthening the legislative \r\nand regulatory framework on fisheries, increasing our \r\nmarine reserves from 3 per cent to 10 per cent of our \r\nterritorial waters and implementing legislation to curb \r\nthe use of plastics. Among our ambitious climate-action \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

Belize \r\nproudly hosted the launch of the CARICOM First \r\nLadies and Spouses of Prime Ministers Network in \r\nsupport of the Implementation of SDG 5 and the Every \r\nCaribbean Woman, Every Caribbean Child initiative. \r\nOur leaders are also renewing and deepening efforts \r\nto tackle non-communicable diseases through targeted \r\napproaches aimed at promoting healthy lifestyles, \r\nstarting with the youngest members of our communities.\r\nFor our region, security and climate change are \r\nequally fundamental threats to our survival. The region \r\nhas risen to meet these challenges by adopting its own \r\ncounter-terrorism strategy and pioneering innovative \r\napproaches to building resilience and facilitating its \r\ntransition to low- and no-carbon economies across \r\nthe region.\r\nI will now address the challenges and opportunities \r\nof financing people-centred development. The cost \r\nof implementation is by no means negligible. At the \r\nnational level, conservative estimates put the cost \r\nof implementation of our Growth and Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Strategy at a quarter of Belize’s gross \r\ndomestic product. Belize’s development finance \r\nstrategy mirrors the Addis Ababa Agenda for Action. \r\nWe are tapping into a mix of domestic and international \r\nresources through various channels, keeping in mind \r\nthe inhospitable international policy environment. \r\nDomestically, my Government is strengthening its \r\ncapacity to improve revenue collection.\r\nlncentivizing business investment in Belize is also \r\na critical action point for my Government. Like other \r\nvulnerable small island developing States (SIDS), Belize \r\nsaw a sharp decline in foreign direct investment over \r\nthe period from 2015 to 2016. As of 2016, foreign direct \r\ninvestment f lows to SIDS represented only 0.2 per cent \r\nof overall global f lows. To buck this downward trend, \r\nwe have reformed the incentives for doing business in \r\nBelize to comport with the policy space permitted by \r\nour World Trade Organization obligations.\r\nWe have also reformed key institutions to ensure \r\nthe integrity of our financial services industry. The \r\nGovernment has strengthened the institutional capacity, \r\nlegislative framework and supervisory mandate \r\nof its financial intelligence unit. The Caribbean \r\nFinancial Action Task Force has determined that \r\nBelize is in compliance with international standards. \r\nThe Organization for Economic Cooperation and \r\nDevelopment’s Global Forum on Transparency and \r\nExchange of Information for Tax Purposes, which at \r\npresent sets international standards on tax cooperation, \r\nhas listed Belize as a largely compliant tax jurisdiction, \r\nfollowing Belize successful completion of the Global \r\nForum peer review of its legislative, regulatory and \r\nadministrative framework.\r\nIn 2013, Belize adopted the multilateral Convention \r\non Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters, \r\nthe purpose of which is to facilitate cooperation among \r\njurisdictions with a view to combating tax avoidance \r\nand evasion internationally. Additionally, Belize is \r\ncommitted to the Automatic Exchange of Information \r\nstandard and has entered into 31 bilateral Exchange of \r\nInformation agreements.\r\nNevertheless, Belize’s reputation, financial industry \r\nand economy remain vulnerable as a result of unilateral \r\ndeclarations that have labelled our jurisdiction as \r\nuncooperative or non-compliant. Such unilateral \r\ndeclarations cause undue damage to Belize’s reputation \r\nand the integrity of its financial services industry. They \r\nalso dissuade investors and undermine the significant \r\nlegislative and administrative measures undertaken \r\nby our Government to ensure Belize’s compliance \r\nwith international standards and legal obligations. But \r\neven worse, they undermine the very legitimacy of the \r\ninstitutions that promulgate the global standards by \r\nwhich we are all supposed to be measured.\r\nIn Belize’s view, the United Nations must enforce \r\nthe necessary checks and balances that are part of the \r\ninternational financial architecture. We see a role for \r\nthe United Nations in acting as a central multilateral \r\nforum where efforts are consolidated and coherence \r\nand international cooperation promoted on issues that \r\nsupport domestic resource mobilization. Because of \r\nits universal nature, the United Nations is in the best \r\nposition to foster a more inclusive, transparent and \r\nconsultative process for addressing such issues as \r\ninternational cooperation on tax matters and the broader \r\nquestion of financing for sustainable development.\r\nNotwithstanding our best efforts, we cannot \r\nmeet the costs of implementation with our domestic \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 3/34\r\nresources alone. We rely on our bilateral partners from \r\nthe North and the South. We have also developed strong \r\nworking relationships with multilateral development \r\nbanks. But with our current status as a middle-income \r\ncountry, our access to grant and concessional financing \r\nis severely constrained. Belize is in the unenviable \r\nposition of being a heavily indebted middle-income \r\ncountry. Our external public debt stands at 70 per cent \r\nof our gross domestic product, or $2.3 billion, and the \r\ndomestic debt at 22 per cent of gross domestic product, \r\nor $750 million. The cost of interest for these debt \r\nobligations is $109 million for the current fiscal year \r\nalone. Without viable alternatives, my Government \r\nhas to finance its development by contracting loans at \r\nmarket rates.\r\nMy Government has endeavoured to appeal to \r\nour private creditors to renegotiate the onerous bonds \r\nthat threaten to upend the sustainability of our debt. \r\nHowever, the world of international private finance \r\ndoes not place a high priority on public policy, much \r\nless the public policy of a foreign Government. With \r\nthe ongoing crises resulting from the withdrawal of \r\ncorrespondent banking services from relationships \r\nwith our indigenous financial institutions, the entire \r\nCaribbean is experiencing this reality. To the likes of \r\nBank of America or JPMorgan Chase it matters not that \r\nending correspondent banking relations with a national \r\nbank or a central bank effectively excludes that nation \r\nfrom the global financial system, and, in response, the \r\ncountry where those banks are located offers nothing \r\nmore than sympathy. That is a major concern, not just \r\nfor the Caribbean but for all developing countries, given \r\nthe universal pivot towards the private sector financing \r\nthe development agenda.\r\nIt would behoove the United Nations to develop \r\na participatory framework for the private sector in \r\norder to keep account of their commitments made and \r\nactions taken to advance global goals. The High-level \r\nPolitical Forum offers a useful platform for integrating \r\nsuch a framework. The United Nations should also \r\ndevelop appropriate capacities to track the alignment \r\nof private financial f lows with the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development. It is also incumbent on the \r\nUnited Nations to accelerate progress in redefining \r\ndevelopment metrics to respond to the anomaly of \r\nheavily indebted middle-income countries, particularly \r\nthose with unique challenges, such as small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nBelize welcomes the Secretary-General’s commitment \r\nto SIDS. I would like to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend him and you, Mr. President, for holding a \r\nspecial session on Hurricane Irma. I wish to extend my \r\nown Government’s pledge of solidarity to the members \r\nof our Caribbean family that were devastated by that \r\nunprecedented storm and, more recently, by Hurricane \r\nMaria. Hurricanes Irma and Maria have exposed the \r\nacute humanitarian challenge and the equally acute \r\ndevelopment challenge that SIDS face. That challenge \r\nis, without question, a global one, as the Secretary-\r\nGeneral has rightly stated. We look forward to engaging \r\nin action-oriented discussions in order to facilitate \r\npiloting such financing-for-sustainable-development \r\ninitiatives across SIDS as debt swaps for climate \r\naction and the expansion of climate risk insurance, \r\nand to support adaptation measures at individual to \r\nnational levels.\r\nThe United Nations can serve as a global incubator \r\nfor genuine and durable multi-stakeholder partnerships \r\nthat can foster innovation and entrepreneurship in \r\nSIDS. At the national level, we are ready to engage in \r\ndiscussions on how to ensure that the United Nations is \r\nfit for our country’s purposes on the ground as we aim \r\nto implement the ambitious 2030 Agenda and develop \r\ncountry-specific solutions for sustainable financing.\r\nBelize fully agrees with the Secretary-General \r\nthat the United Nations has a crucial role to play as a \r\ncatalyst, an innovator, a convenor and a champion of \r\nwhat works. Since its inception, the United Nations \r\nhas been orchestrating a rules-based framework for \r\nhelping countries to cooperate and take collective \r\naction. As we embrace a new era of openness, \r\ntransparency and accountability, United Nations \r\noperations must also reflect the openness, transparency \r\nand accountability of all who engage and benefit from \r\ninternational cooperation.\r\nWe depend on the United Nations to champion and \r\nprotect the rule of law, ensure the universality of core \r\nagreements and develop new treaties in order to address \r\ngaps where they exist. That is why Belize looks to the \r\nUnited Nations as a firewall between democracy and \r\ntyranny, between social justice and oppression, and \r\nbetween the global good and self-interest. Its ultimate \r\nrole is to protect the interests of humankind as a whole. \r\nIn this spirit, we expect the United Nations to act, and \r\nwe therefore insist that the overdue reforms of the \r\npeace and security architecture of the United Nations, \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n4/34 17-29728\r\nespecially the Security Council, be completed forthwith \r\nso that there can be no obstacle to action.\r\nBelize has long supported the United Nations in \r\nfulfilling its role. We have supported its endeavours to \r\nforge new partnerships for development, advance global \r\nhealth policies, bring justice to victims of crimes against \r\nhumanity, protect the most vulnerable and control the \r\nspread of weapons of mass destruction, including small \r\narms and light weapons. We have been at the forefront \r\nof the global fight to protect and preserve our shared \r\nnatural environment against environmental degradation \r\nand climate change and to ensure the sustainable use \r\nof the planet, especially of our oceans, which sustain \r\nlife on earth. Through the Caribbean Community, we \r\nare also leading the charge to deliver reparations to the \r\nvictims of slavery and their descendants.\r\nFor Belize, as a State Member of the United \r\nNations, advocating for peaceful cooperation among \r\nStates, the right to self-determination for all peoples \r\nand the promotion and protection of human rights is \r\na non-derogable duty. We therefore cannot remain \r\nsilent wherever injustice persists. We see injustice \r\nperpetrated against the people of Taiwan, who uphold \r\nthe core purposes and principles of the United Nations, \r\nwhile, in contrast, the United Nations fails to uphold \r\nthose purposes and principles with respect to them.\r\nFor more than half a century, the people of Cuba \r\nhave been the victims of the injustice of an egregious \r\nand illegal unilateral embargo. We also see injustice \r\ncontinuing to cast a shadow over the peoples of \r\nPalestine, Syria, Yemen, Western Sahara and South \r\nSudan, among others.\r\nThe situation in Venezuela is one that continues \r\nto challenge all of us in our region and hemisphere. \r\nBelize fully subscribes to the position of CARICOM, \r\nwhich underscores respect for international law and \r\ninternational principles and urges resolution through \r\ndialogue. To that end, CARICOM has offered its own \r\ngood offices.\r\nIn our region, we continue to witness the suffering \r\nof our Haitian brothers and sisters. Belize cannot \r\nremain silent in the face of such intolerable injustice, \r\nnor should the rest of the world. We support United \r\nNations efforts aimed at bringing justice to all who \r\nhave been alienated, oppressed, victimized or silenced. \r\nWhen we fail to uphold our duty to the norms and \r\nvalues of the United Nations, humankind itself suffers. \r\nBut when we defend those norms and values, there is no \r\ngreater redemption. The Haitian people know this fact \r\nall too well, and, with good reason, they look hopefully \r\ntowards the new United Nations approach to cholera \r\nin Haiti and the establishment of the United Nations \r\nMission for Justice Support in Haiti.\r\nSimilarly, when Belize’s territorial integrity was \r\nat issue, Belize turned to the United Nations to defend \r\nthe country’s sovereignty over its land, and, for as long \r\nas we have been a dutiful Member State, we have had \r\npeace. We want that peace to endure, so we have taken \r\nevery possible step to bring Guatemala to the table of \r\njustice in order to resolve that country’s unfounded \r\nclaim on our territory.\r\nIn 2008, Belize and Guatemala agreed to refer \r\nthe Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice, the Organization’s \r\njudicial arm, subject to the will of each of our peoples. \r\nBoth Belize and Guatemala are poised to hold the \r\nrequisite referendums to obtain our peoples’ consent. In \r\nthe meantime, with the full support of the Organization \r\nof American States, we continue to take a constructive \r\napproach to our bilateral relations and to maintaining \r\npeace along the borders. Belize remains committed \r\nto working with Guatemala to finalize a cooperation \r\nmechanism for the Sarstoon River in order to minimize \r\nthe potential for tensions or incidents along Belize’s \r\nsouthern border.\r\nIn conclusion, for the past 36 years, we Belizeans \r\nhave lived in harmony with one another and with nature. \r\nTogether with our leaders and with the support of other \r\nfriendly nations, we have built a strong nation by the \r\nsweat of our brows. We have honoured our Constitution, \r\nwhich enshrines the principle of social, economic and \r\nenvironmental justice for all. We will persevere in our \r\nefforts to achieve our just objectives and look to the \r\nUnited Nations for its continued support. In turn, the \r\nUnited Nations and every Member State can rest assured \r\nthat Belize will defend our community of nations and \r\nits purposes and principles. Our national motto is “Sub \r\numbra f loreo” — “In the shade I f lourish”. In the shade \r\nof the United Nations, we shall all f lourish.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Nicola Renzi, Minister for Foreign and Political \r\nAffairs and Justice of the Republic of San Marino.\r\nMr. Renzi (San Marino) (spoke in Italian; \r\nEnglish text provided by the delegation): On behalf \r\nof the Government of the Republic of San Marino, I \r\nwould like to congratulate you, Sir, on your election \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 5/34\r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session and to wish you a successful term. Your \r\nexperience as Minister for Foreign Affairs of Slovakia \r\nand your deep knowledge of international affairs are \r\ninvaluable resources for the United Nations. The San \r\nMarino delegation assures you of its utmost willingness \r\nto work with you in the course of this session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nMy country would also like to offer its heartfelt \r\ncongratulations to His Excellency Mr. António \r\nGuterres as he embarks on fulfilling his new mandate \r\nas Secretary-General. We thank him for the energy and \r\ndetermination he has already shown in his first months \r\nof activity at the helm of the Organization.\r\nI am grateful for the theme chosen for this \r\nsession — “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and \r\na decent life for all on a sustainable planet” — where \r\nissues that the Republic of San Marino holds dear, such \r\nas human rights, peace and sustainable development, \r\nare at the heart of the agenda. It is a cross-cutting \r\ntheme, since upholding human rights is reflected in \r\nevery action the United Nations takes in the service of \r\npeace, security, justice and sustainable development. \r\nIn the coming years, the international community will \r\nhave to do all it can to achieve these objectives.\r\nTo our dismay, in every situation of armed \r\nconflict we are witnessing the systematic violation of \r\nhuman rights. Refugees and migrants are subject to \r\ndiscrimination, various forms of abuse and trafficking. \r\nRacial and religious discrimination and intolerance \r\npersist in many parts of the world. Inequality and social \r\nexclusion are at the root of the numerous and increasingly \r\ncomplex challenges that the United Nations is called \r\nupon to address. Unfortunately, in recent years we have \r\nseen an increase in inequality and marginalization, \r\nnot only in developing countries but even in the \r\nrichest ones, where increasingly large sections of the \r\npopulation struggle against growing poverty. This is a \r\nthreat to global stability, as it leads to an erosion of \r\nconfidence in national and multilateral institutions and \r\nfuels nationalist and populist movements. Collective \r\ncommitment to human rights is therefore essential.\r\nThe relationship between peace, security and \r\nrespect for human rights is undeniable. Measures for the \r\nprotection and promotion of human rights are essential \r\nto preventing conflicts and ensuring peace. Moreover, \r\npeace and sustainable development are complementary \r\nconcepts. More inclusive and peaceful societies provide \r\nbetter conditions for sustainable development, and \r\nvice versa.\r\nThe complexity of the challenges that the United \r\nNations must tackle today is unparalleled in the history \r\nof the Organization. Their interconnected nature \r\nreminds us that countries must act together to be more \r\neffective in the fight against climate change, global \r\nterrorism and poverty and to build more inclusive, safe \r\nand just societies for all. As the Secretary-General stated \r\nin his report on the work of the Organization (A/72/1), \r\nit is important to rekindle faith in multilateralism and, \r\nin particular, in the United Nations. Our country has \r\nalways believed in the power of dialogue and respect \r\nfor others, which are values that underpin the peaceful \r\ncoexistence among peoples.\r\nThe profoundly egalitarian nature and unquestioned \r\nlegitimacy of the United Nations, together with the \r\nuniversal character of participation in it, unequivocally \r\nreaffirm its value and central role as a forum for \r\nsolving global problems. The various religious and \r\ncultural traditions present in the Organization should \r\nbe not an obstacle but rather a valuable resource for \r\nachieving global solutions through mediating and \r\nsynthesizing diversities.\r\nThe United Nations must adapt quickly to new \r\nglobal challenges and to the new opportunities offered \r\nby an increasingly interconnected world so that it can \r\nbe effective in carrying out its mandate. Reform is \r\ntherefore crucial to future stability in the world and to \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security, \r\nwhich must remain at the centre of our actions. We \r\nreject any diminution of the role of the United Nations \r\njust because a universal agreement on the reforms \r\nneeded to improve its functioning cannot be found.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino is attentively \r\nfollowing the revitalization process of the General \r\nAssembly, which must continue to be a meeting point \r\nand forum for the exchange of ideas and discussion, \r\nleading to solutions rooted in a strong consensus. \r\nSimilarly, Security Council reform should be an \r\nobjective of all Member States. As we have stated on \r\nprevious occasions, we believe that intergovernmental \r\nnegotiations contribute to agreements that reflect a \r\nbroad and strong political consensus representing the \r\ninterests of all negotiating groups.\r\nSan Marino calls for reform that can make the \r\nSecurity Council more democratic, transparent, \r\nefficient and accountable. This goal can be achieved \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n6/34 17-29728\r\nonly through continuous dialogue among States, with \r\nthe understanding that it is essential to go beyond \r\ninitial positions if the broadest agreements possible \r\nare to be achieved. The Republic of San Marino \r\nsupports the Secretary-General’s reform agenda, which \r\nfeatures streamlining procedures, decentralizing \r\ndecision-making processes and achieving greater \r\ntransparency and accountability.\r\nHuman rights are the raison d’être of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development and the 17 Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. The Agenda defines our future and \r\na vision of a peaceful, inclusive and safe society where \r\nthe burden of poverty has been eradicated, prosperity \r\nis shared and decent work is available to all. Together \r\nwith the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, it also \r\nreflects the ambition and commitment of Member \r\nStates to reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 2020, \r\ngiving our planet and its inhabitants the chance to \r\nlive longer and in better conditions. The 2030 Agenda \r\nis ambitious because it is universal: it integrates the \r\nthree dimensions of sustainable development — social, \r\neconomic and environmental — and is applicable to \r\nall States.\r\nA year after the adoption of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, their effective implementation is \r\nthe real challenge of today. In many areas covered by \r\nthe 2030 Agenda, progress has unfortunately not been \r\nin line with hopes. For example, much more needs to \r\nbe done for the 700 million people living in extreme \r\npoverty and experiencing malnutrition. More targeted \r\nactions should be implemented to reduce maternal \r\nmortality and gender inequality, ensure inclusive and \r\nequitable educational systems, invest in sustainable \r\nenergy and provide health care to wider segments of \r\nthe population. The implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nis the responsibility of individual States, which should \r\nkeep their promises by incorporating the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals into their development legislation \r\nand policies.\r\nA cultural revolution must be part of our policies \r\nin the coming years. In the Republic of San Marino, \r\nfor instance, we have promoted education initiatives on \r\nsustainable development in various sectors, including \r\neducation, construction, waste disposal and public \r\ntransport. As a complement to national Governments, \r\ncivil society and the private sector also play important \r\nroles in mobilizing the resources needed for the \r\nimplementation of the Agenda. In this regard, San \r\nMarino recalls the important results achieved following \r\nthe adoption of the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which \r\nidentified various concrete measures that could be taken \r\nto finance development and laid the foundation for the \r\nglobal programme contained in the 2030 Agenda.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda states that the rights of the most \r\nvulnerable people must be promoted and protected. \r\nThe Republic of San Marino has always paid special \r\nattention to the most vulnerable groups — women, \r\nchildren, the elderly and the disabled. San Marino, \r\nwhich was among the first countries to become \r\nsignatories to the Convention on the Rights of Persons \r\nwith Disabilities, intends to fully implement that \r\nConvention by adopting legislative frameworks and \r\npolicies that favour the inclusion and full participation \r\nof people with disabilities in the employment, social \r\nand cultural contexts of the country.\r\nGender equality must be a goal of the international \r\ncommunity. Unfortunately, women are still victims \r\nof discrimination and violence in many parts of the \r\nworld, including in the most developed countries. In \r\nsupport of the initiatives promoted by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, San Marino has signed the voluntary compact \r\non preventing sexual exploitation and abuse in United \r\nNations peacekeeping missions. We believe that the \r\nrights and dignity of the victims of sexual abuse should \r\nbe at the heart of our collective efforts.\r\nChildren are sadly the most vulnerable group \r\nof all and can be victims of violence, abuse and \r\nexploitation. Protecting their rights must be at the heart \r\nof our actions. San Marino supports the Ministerial \r\nDeclaration made at this year’s High-Level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development, which reaffirms \r\nthe commitment of the international community to \r\nchildren, focusing in particular on eradicating poverty, \r\npromoting their participation and eliminating all forms \r\nof violence and discrimination.\r\nRefugees and migrants continue to be subject to \r\nviolent discrimination. The enormous humanitarian \r\nchallenge posed by large movements of refugees \r\nand migrants can be addressed only through greater \r\ncooperation and better sharing of responsibilities and \r\ncosts among all States. The movement-of-peoples \r\nphenomenon has reached a level unprecedented in \r\nthe history of the United Nations. The Republic of \r\nSan Marino supports the New York Declaration for \r\nRefugees and Migrants, adopted in September 2016. It \r\ncontains a series of bold commitments to addressing \r\nthe challenges posed by the large f lows of migrants and \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 7/34\r\nrefugees, but it also provides for developing a plan for \r\nthe implementation of these commitments.\r\nIn addition to dealing with large movements of \r\nrefugees and migrants, the United Nations has also been \r\ncalled on to address grave and complex humanitarian \r\ncrises. As the Secretary-General mentioned in his report \r\non the activity of the Organization, approximately \r\n96 million people, in more than 40 countries, more \r\nthan half of whom were women and children, received \r\nhumanitarian assistance in 2017. The report shows that \r\nin 2016, natural disasters caused the displacement of \r\napproximately 31 million people, three times more \r\nthan those forced to f lee because of armed conflicts. \r\nAn unprecedented food crisis has affected more than \r\n20 million people on the African continent.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino has always supported \r\ncooperation projects and emergency interventions under \r\nthe auspices of numerous international organizations, \r\nin particular entities within the United Nations family. \r\nOur country is grateful to the Secretary-General for \r\nthe rapid and crucial action he has undertaken for \r\npopulations facing humanitarian emergencies, as well \r\nas to the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian \r\nAffairs and the Central Emergency Response Fund for \r\ntheir rapid response and substantial contribution.\r\nToday, the United Nations is engaged in the widest \r\ndeployment of peacekeeping operations and special \r\npolitical missions in its history. Recent and ongoing wars \r\nhave caused great suffering for civilians, unprecedented \r\nglobal humanitarian crises, tragic, massive movements \r\nof migrants and refugees, and an increase in terrorism, \r\nviolent extremism, populism and intolerance.\r\nDespite the negotiations for a political solution in \r\nSyria, which resumed in January under the auspices of \r\nthe United Nations, facilitated by the Special Envoy of \r\nthe Secretary-General, to whom the Republic of San \r\nMarino gives its full support, the situation remains \r\nhighly volatile, has led to a massive displacement of \r\ncivilians and, at the same time, poses a threat to the \r\nstability of the entire region.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his initiative aimed at strengthening \r\nprevention activities and conflict mediation. In this \r\nregard, my country will participate in the Italian \r\ninitiative for the creation of a network of women \r\nmediators in the Mediterranean area, the purpose \r\nof which is to contribute to peace processes through \r\nprevention and mediation. By establishing relations \r\nwith the various national or regional stakeholders \r\nand working to achieve sustainable peace, the United \r\nNations should be able to anticipate the causes of a \r\npossible conflict.\r\nMore and more frequently, terrorism and violent \r\nextremism are generated and fuelled by armed \r\nconflicts, exacerbating ethnic, religious, political and \r\neconomic tensions. Violations of human rights by such \r\nterrorist groups as the Islamic State in Iraq and the \r\nLevant, Al-Qaida and Boko Haram are very serious and \r\ninclude murder, kidnapping, forced conversion, human \r\ntrafficking, slavery, sexual abuse, and the destruction \r\nof places of religious or cultural significance for ethnic \r\nand religious minorities.\r\nThe self-proclaimed Islamic State and its associated \r\nforces have also been responsible for numerous deadly \r\nterrorist attacks in Europe, Asia and Africa. The \r\ninternational community and the United Nations must \r\nact so that those responsible for those heinous crimes are \r\nbrought to justice. San Marino supports the activities \r\nand initiatives of the United Nations in promoting \r\njustice and the rule of law, which form an integral part \r\nof the agenda to promote and protect human rights.\r\nMy country welcomes the actions taken by the \r\nSecretary-General, with the support of the General \r\nAssembly, to establish the Office of Counter-Terrorism, \r\nheaded by an Under-Secretary-General, with a view \r\nto enhancing coherence in United Nations action and \r\nprovide better assistance to Member States in their own \r\nfight against terrorism.\r\nDisarmament activity plays a crucial role in \r\nmaintaining international peace and security. The \r\nrecent tests carried out by the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea in the context of a nuclear-\r\nweapons programme threaten security globally as \r\nwell as regionally and underline the need for robust \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation policies. San Marino \r\nstrongly condemns the launching of missiles by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea and demands \r\nthat it cease such activity. We also call for the sanctions \r\nset forth in recent Security Council resolutions to be \r\nfully implemented by all States.\r\nThe Republic of San Marino took part in the \r\nnegotiations that led to the adoption of the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons last July. The Treaty \r\nis an important step in efforts aimed at achieving the \r\nshared goal of a world without nuclear weapons.\r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n8/34 17-29728\r\nIn order to address today’s many and complex \r\nchallenges, the United Nations must be more effective \r\nand f lexible. Member States must assume their \r\nresponsibilities in that regard, including that of helping \r\nour Organization live up to its mandate, which is to \r\nprotect the citizens of the world.\r\nThanks to its centuries-long history of peace and \r\nfreedom, San Marino is a State with a strong identity. \r\nAlthough our State is small, it is proud to make \r\nits contribution to the United Nations community. \r\nEverything we do is aimed at restoring the capacity \r\nand authority of the United Nations, so that it can \r\ncontinue to be the indispensable reference point of the \r\ninternational community.\r\nThe President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Aurelia Frick, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nMinister for Education and Minister for Cultural \r\nAffairs of the Principality of Liechtenstein.\r\nMs. Frick (Liechtenstein): Mr. President, it is good \r\nto see you presiding over this session of the General \r\nAssembly. We know that we are in very able hands, and \r\nI look forward to working closely with you. We also \r\nsalute the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, \r\nfor his leadership. I am confident that he will chart an \r\nintelligent course for us to make the changes we wish to \r\nsee in the United Nations.\r\nMr. President, you have proposed for this session \r\nthe theme “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and \r\na decent life for all on a sustainable planet”, which \r\ntakes us back to the very beginning of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations, written on behalf of the peoples of \r\nthe world. To this day, the United Nations symbolizes \r\ngreat hope around the globe — hope for peace, hope for \r\njustice and hope for a life of dignity and decency, which \r\nrepresent the basic ambition of every human being. Yet \r\nfulfilling these hopes remains elusive for millions, and \r\nfor millions of others those hopes have been shattered.\r\nIntolerance and nationalism were the drivers of the \r\nSecond World War, and the Organization was founded \r\nin response to them. It is a place where we seek solutions \r\ntogether, instead of pursuing nationalist agendas. Only \r\nby embracing this understanding will we be able to \r\nachieve the best results at the United Nations. The \r\nhorrors of armed conflict — the tragedy of the Second \r\nWorld War in particular — led the founding nations to \r\npledge to save succeeding generations from the scourge \r\nof war. We have make a collective commitment to \r\nremoving threats to peace and to suppressing acts of \r\naggression. But today we often manage and contain \r\narmed conflict rather than preventing it in the first \r\nplace. We must do better.\r\nThis year we have the opportunity to take a historic \r\nstep forward. For the first time since the creation of \r\nthe United Nations, we can give an international \r\ntribunal jurisdiction over the crime of aggression. The \r\nmost serious forms of the illegal use of force will be \r\npunishable. The tribunal in charge — and the centrepiece \r\nof our common fight for accountability — will be the \r\nInternational Criminal Court (ICC). I appeal to those \r\nassembled here today to live up to the commitment we \r\nmade when we signed onto the United Nations Charter. \r\nLet us enforce the prohibition of the illegal use of force \r\nby making it punishable in the highest court of criminal \r\nlaw we have.\r\nNext year, we will celebrate the twentieth anniversary \r\nof the ICC. With jurisdiction over the most serious \r\nviolations of international law, the establishment of the \r\nCourt was an enormous achievement, but, today, it still \r\nlacks universality. There remains therefore a significant \r\nimpunity gap. A very large number of people in the \r\nworld do not benefit from its legal protection.\r\nThese people must not be left without hope. They \r\ntoo deserve real prospects for justice. The people \r\nof Syria, for example, have suffered unspeakable \r\nviolence. The crimes committed against them have \r\nbeen atrocious. And the silence with which we met \r\nthose atrocities for so long puts us all to shame. But \r\nfinally, late last year, we came together to create a real \r\npossibility for justice — the International, Impartial and \r\nIndependent Mechanism to Assist in the Investigation \r\nand Prosecution of those Responsible for the Most \r\nSerious Crimes under International Law committed \r\nin the Syrian Arab Republic since March 2011, the \r\naccountability mechanism established by the General \r\nAssembly in resolution 71/248. The Mechanism \r\nitself will not conduct criminal proceedings against \r\nperpetrators. But it could be critically important in the \r\npreparation of case files for prosecution in courts with \r\njurisdiction. This is a decisive step forward. A key to the \r\nMechanism’s success will be strong support from us, \r\nthe States Members of the United Nations — politically, \r\nby insisting on the importance of justice as part of \r\npolitical solutions; financially, by providing sustainable \r\nfunding; and substantively, by sharing information and \r\nevidence of crimes that are in our possession.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 9/34\r\nAccountability for the worst crimes imaginable, \r\nwhether committed in Syria or elsewhere, is essential. \r\nBut the truth is that there is no remedy and no \r\ncompensation for these crimes. Prevention is the only \r\neffective form of protection. We look in particular to the \r\nSecurity Council for leadership. I thank the 113 States \r\nthat have joined us in supporting the code of conduct \r\nregarding Security Council action against genocide, \r\ncrimes against humanity and war crimes. Together, we \r\nrepresent a strong majority of States expecting effective \r\naction from the Council aimed at ending and preventing \r\nsuch crimes. This pledge could not come at a better \r\nmoment. The Secretary-General has made prevention \r\na key priority in his agenda, and applying the Code of \r\nConduct works best when there is productive interplay \r\nbetween him and the Security Council.\r\nNever before have the needs for humanitarian \r\nassistance been as great as they are today. And never \r\nbefore have we seen such a significant shortfall in our \r\nresponse. The so-called forgotten crises are those that \r\nmay need our attention the most. Yet our collective \r\nattention span barely does justice to even the most \r\nvisible of emergencies.\r\nArmed conflict remains a key driver of displacement, \r\nhuman suffering and instability. But there are numerous \r\nother factors that make people leave their homes. \r\nToday, unprecedented numbers of people are on the \r\nmove across the globe. Across the backdrop of history, \r\nthere have been various periods of mass migration \r\nand there is ample evidence that migration has been a \r\npositive and enriching factor for receiving societies. \r\nBut mass movements of people and irregular migration \r\nin particular also tend to create anxiety and fear. Taking \r\nthese reactions seriously is crucial to overcoming them.\r\nMy son, Leonard, entered kindergarten last year. \r\nTwo children in his group are refugees from Syria. As a \r\nmother, I ref lected on how this might influence him and \r\nhis development. What happened was that he quickly \r\nlearned a few words in Arabic and he knows what a \r\nSyrian birthday cake tastes like. He also understands \r\nnow that there are kids who spend every single night \r\nthinking that their house might be bombed.\r\nWe place high hopes in the global compact for \r\nsafe, orderly and regular migration that we will adopt \r\ntogether next year. I echo the call of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral: migration must be an option, not a necessity. \r\nIrregular migrants are particularly vulnerable to \r\nexploitation and abuse. Human trafficking and modern \r\nslavery are perhaps the greatest human rights scandal \r\nof our time. They are also a global phenomenon and \r\nthey particularly thrive in circumstances that create \r\nhigh levels of vulnerability. As is the case so often, \r\nwomen and girls are disproportionately affected. Many \r\ndecades ago, we agreed on the abolition of slavery \r\nin all its forms. The relevant legal norm requires \r\nuniversal application. And yet the reality is that there \r\nis a disturbing level of impunity for the commission of \r\nthese acts.\r\nWe must no longer accept this paradox. Human \r\ntrafficking and modern slavery are not just crimes, \r\nthey are also a profitable form of organized crime. We \r\ntherefore see great potential here in applying the tools \r\ndeveloped to combat other forms of organized crime. \r\nFollowing the money can lead us to the perpetrators of \r\nthese crimes. In this regard, Liechtenstein is prepared to \r\nshare the expertise it has acquired as a financial centre \r\ncommitted to international standards of transparency \r\nand accountability.\r\nThe people whom we serve look to us to reduce \r\nrisks and defuse tensions. Yet the world is spiralling \r\ntowards a new arms race. We are facing increased risks \r\nof self-destruction, including the unspeakable horror of \r\nthe use of nuclear weapons. Most of us remember the \r\nshocking pictures of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in August \r\n1945 from our history books. The United Nations was \r\nbuilt on the ashes of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and on \r\nthe promise of “never again”, but, owing to collective \r\ncomplacency, we have not delivered on that promise.\r\nThis week we have changed course for the better with \r\nthe signing of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons. Without any doubt, it will take time to see \r\nthe Treaty’s effects on nuclear stockpiles. Nevertheless, \r\nsetting a number of important legal benchmarks that \r\nwill become binding norms is great progress. Nuclear \r\nweapons are prohibited and should be eliminated. Their \r\nuse can never be justified. The suffering that they cause \r\nruns counter to fundamental principles of humanity, \r\nthe basic tenets of international humanitarian law and \r\nthe dictates of public conscience. On Wednesday, I \r\nsigned the Treaty on behalf of Liechtenstein as one of \r\n50 signatory States. Together we extend a hand to those \r\nwho so far have chosen to stand apart. We need their \r\ncommitment to succeed in finally ridding the world of \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nI have had the privilege to address the General \r\nAssembly eight times. On each of those occasions, \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n10/34 17-29728\r\nI have talked about a particular aspect of the work \r\nof the United Nations that is of special significance \r\nto me — full gender equality. The progress made in \r\nthe past few decades has significantly slowed, both \r\ninternationally and back home. That is a disturbing \r\ntrend. Commitments have gone unfulfilled and \r\nstrategies have turned out to be little more than empty \r\npromises. The achievements that nobody questioned 20 \r\nyears ago are now under attack. The level of political \r\nparticipation has decreased, and the statistics on gender \r\npay gaps are still shocking. Yet I remain not only \r\ncommitted but optimistic, simply because I strongly \r\nbelieve that many of our common goals will become \r\nachievable only if we indeed achieve gender equality. \r\nIn the Sustainable Development Goals, the domestic \r\nand the international come together. If there is one area \r\nin which the United Nations must show the way, this is \r\ncertainly it.\r\nThe work of the United Nations can seem abstract. \r\nExplaining its relevance to our citizens at home \r\nand to our children can be a challenge. There are \r\ntopics that make that task much easier, however; for \r\nexample, climate change. Everyone understands what \r\nis at stake in that discussion. If we cannot live on our \r\nplanet, no one will prosper, irrespective of nationality, \r\ngender or economic wealth. And no country, large or \r\nsmall, can tackle the problem on its own. The Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change does not end the threat \r\nof climate change, but it is our only realistic hope for \r\naddressing the issue together. I therefore experienced \r\ngreat satisfaction when I deposited Liechtenstein’s \r\ninstrument of ratification earlier this week. Indeed, it \r\nis something I will be proud to share with my children.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Nikos Kotzias, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nHellenic Republic.\r\nMr. Kotzias (Greece) (spoke in Greek; English text \r\nprovided by the delegation): First of all, I would like \r\nto wish every success to the new Secretary-General, \r\nMr. Guterres, and reaffirm our full support for his work.\r\nAllow me also to congratulate you, Sir, on both \r\nyour election to the office of President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session and on the \r\nchoice of this year’s main theme.\r\nOur world is changing rapidly today. We are going \r\nthrough a second era of machines — an era in which \r\nmachines are no longer an extension of physical strength \r\nbut provide spiritual wealth and knowledge. Although \r\ntoday they are faster and smaller, they have an immense \r\nimpact on our daily lives, affecting the way we work, \r\nproduce, communicate and interact. This new trend \r\ncould be described as the fourth Industrial Revolution. \r\nIt brings with it innovations and advantages, as well as \r\nchallenges, especially for States. These challenges must \r\nbe addressed in an effective manner if we are to survive \r\nin the complex international reality of today.\r\nStates have to show resilience and meet the needs of \r\ntheir peoples in terms of human rights, communication, \r\ngrowth and innovation. They have to evolve, but this \r\nevolution must linked to that of the Organization. Will \r\nthe United Nations be able to keep pace with these \r\ndevelopments and adapt to new, emerging realities? In \r\nthe light of this double adaptation, this is an extremely \r\ncritical time. It will require  reforms that can enable the \r\nUnited Nations to remain relevant in an ever-changing \r\nworld that is very different from the one that existed \r\nin 1945. If the United Nations is to retain its ability to \r\nfulfil its mandate, it must evolve to meet the challenges \r\nbefore us.\r\nAs insecurity and instability abound over \r\nlarge swathes of the globe, Greece is formulating \r\na multidimensional foreign policy with a view to \r\nactively contributing to the attainment of peace \r\nthrough concrete proposals in international forums and \r\nregional organizations and the promotion of stability \r\nthrough political initiatives. More specifically, we \r\nfavour the prospect of broadening the agenda that the \r\ninstitutionalized dialogue and cooperation between the \r\nEuropean Union and the United Nations is addressing \r\non an already wide array of issues of global concern.\r\nIn line with our shared vision, we all want to \r\nsee a world free of weapons of mass destruction. \r\nIn that context, we firmly condemn North Korea’s \r\nongoing illegal nuclear-weapon and ballistic-missile \r\nprogrammes, including its most recent test, which \r\nseriously endanger regional and international peace \r\nand security. Considering the developments in \r\ndisarmament and non-proliferation that we have \r\nseen over the past year, I believe that it is now more \r\nimperative than ever to seek avenues of dialogue with \r\nthe participation of nuclear-weapon States. That could \r\nbe a way to bridge the gap between the step-by-step \r\napproach to nuclear disarmament and a non-verifiable \r\nimmediate and total ban.\r\nWhile it is situated close to regions that are \r\nextremely turbulent, such as the Middle East and parts \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 11/34\r\nof North Africa, Greece continues to be a pillar of \r\nstability. In that context, we have recently undertaken \r\nmany initiatives, such as the Rhodes Conference for \r\nSecurity and Stability and the International Conference \r\non Religious and Cultural Pluralism and Peaceful \r\nCoexistence in the Middle East, held in Athens, as \r\nwell as the recently established Ancient Civilizations \r\nForum, whose latest meeting took place here in New \r\nYork only yesterday. The Rhodes Conference focuses \r\non a positive agenda of cooperation among 20 European \r\nand Arab countries in the Eastern Mediterranean, with \r\nthe aim of fostering stability and security in the region.\r\nI would also like to mention that, together with \r\nCyprus, in a context of promoting peace and stability \r\nin the Eastern Mediterranean, we have established a \r\nnumber of trilateral forms of cooperation that include \r\nEgypt, Israel, Jordan, Lebanon and Palestine. Our main \r\nobjective is to develop a positive and multidimensional \r\nagenda for cooperation in international affairs, with \r\na focus on synergies and joint activities, especially \r\nthrough culture, as one of the main drivers of soft \r\npower in international relations, and in other areas of \r\ncooperation such as trade, education and research.\r\nEnhancing regional cooperation in the Balkans \r\nis also the basic principle behind the Greek initiative \r\nof quadrilateral meetings launched in Thessaloniki in \r\nApril 2016 between the Foreign Ministers of Greece, \r\nAlbania, Bulgaria and the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia. At their forthcoming meeting in October, \r\nwith a view to developing an effective response to the \r\nrefugee crisis that is in line with European democratic \r\nvalues and principles, the four countries will focus \r\non identifying ways for improving their interaction \r\non issues such as return operations, the exchange of \r\ninformation and tackling smuggling, human trafficking, \r\nterrorism and organized crime and energy networks.\r\nThe Syrian war has taken a terrible toll in human \r\nlives and has displaced millions. A cessation of \r\nhostilities is essential to ensuring progress in the \r\npolitical negotiations. Greece sees no alternative to a \r\npolitical solution to the crisis, and we fully support an \r\ninclusive political dialogue in Geneva under United \r\nNations auspices.\r\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains a constant \r\nthreat to regional stability and security, and the current \r\nsituation on the ground is not sustainable. We support \r\na two-State solution, meaning the establishment of a \r\nsovereign and independent State of Palestine living in \r\npeace and security alongside the State of Israel, while \r\nat the same time ensuring that Israel’s long-standing \r\nquest for security is satisfied.\r\nWith regard to Libya, Greece considers the \r\ninternational efforts to stabilize the country to be \r\ncrucial. We firmly believe that there can be no military \r\nsolution to the crisis in that country and support every \r\neffort to achieve peace and security there.\r\nTerrorism remains one of the major global \r\nchallenges we face, and the significant progress \r\nwe have seen recently in the fight against Da’esh \r\ndeserves special mention. Strengthening international \r\ncooperation among all the relevant actors and improving \r\nthe exchange of information constitute key elements in \r\ntackling the f lows of foreign fighters. At the same time, \r\nwe must address the root causes of violent extremism. \r\nGreece is actively involved in our shared fight against \r\nterrorism. In the context of the work of preventing \r\nterrorists from exploiting resources for their activities, \r\nwe particularly support international efforts aimed at \r\npromoting concerted international action against the \r\nillegal trade in antiquities and cultural artefacts.\r\nWe consistently pursue friendly relations and \r\nenhanced cooperation with all our neighbours with a \r\nview to promoting stability and prosperity for all. In \r\nthe Western Balkans, Greece remains a firm supporter \r\nof the European Union’s enlargement policy. The rise \r\nof nationalistic rhetoric in the region is very worrying, \r\nhowever. We want to underline that actions and \r\nstatements that undermine good-neighbourly relations \r\nshould be avoided at all costs.\r\nWe should also emphasize that we maintain a \r\nfriendly approach to the former Yugoslav Republic of \r\nMacedonia. Greece’s initiative aimed at designing and \r\nimplementing bilateral confidence-building measures \r\nhas strengthened relations between us and facilitated \r\nefforts to address more sensitive matters, such as the \r\nongoing issue of our neighbour’s name. In that respect, \r\nGreece will continue its systematic efforts to reach a \r\nmutually acceptable solution to the issue of the former \r\nYugoslav Republic of Macedonia’s name. Our position \r\nis clear — the name must be mutually acceptable.\r\nWhere Greek-Turkish relations are concerned, we \r\nbelieve they can be built only on a basis of full respect \r\nfor international law, including the international law \r\nof the sea. We have repeatedly pointed out that good-\r\nneighbourly relations are not served by a neighbour \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n12/34 17-29728\r\nthat persistently challenges Greece’s sovereignty and \r\nsovereign rights.\r\nWith regard to the Cyprus issue, our objective \r\nis summed up in the concept outlined by the \r\nSecretary-General at the international Conference \r\non Cyprus — which is to make Cyprus a so-called \r\nnormal State, one that is sovereign, independent and \r\nfree of foreign-occupation troops, external guarantees \r\nand rights to intervention. Unfortunately, the July \r\nConference on Cyprus in Switzerland ended without \r\nan agreement being reached, because the Turkish \r\nand Turkish-Cypriot sides were the only parties at \r\nthe Conference that did not share the goal of the \r\nnormal-State concept. Greece is prepared to continue \r\ndiscussing the key international issue of security \r\nand guarantees as soon as Turkey demonstrates clear \r\nwillingness to resume negotiations on the basis of \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions, as well as \r\nwithin the framework of the parameters outlined by the \r\nSecretary-General in Crans-Montana.\r\nIn the area of civil and political rights, we actively \r\nsupport the fight against racism and all forms of \r\ndiscrimination, whether on religious, gender, sexual or \r\nany other grounds. In that regard, Greece, with the aim of \r\nprioritizing the safety of journalists and media workers, \r\nespecially in conflict areas, will submit a relevant \r\nthematic draft resolution in the Third Committee at the \r\ncurrent session. In the framework of the Human Rights \r\nCouncil, my country has also spearheaded an initiative \r\nwith its successful submission of a draft for Human \r\nRights Council resolution 35/28, on the convening of the \r\nSocial Forum in 2018 in order to focus on the promotion \r\nof human rights through sport and the Olympic ideal.\r\nMrs. Pobee (Ghana), Vice-President, took the Chair.\r\nMy country remains committed to the protection \r\nof human rights in all policies that address large \r\nmovements of migrants, with particular attention to the \r\nneeds of migrants, including children, in vulnerable \r\nsituations. We also believe that implementing that \r\nframework correctly is more important than ever if \r\nwe are to protect those who need it, combat human \r\ntrafficking and migrant smuggling and return those not \r\nentitled to international protection to their homes, while \r\nat the same time tackling the root causes of migration \r\nthrough effective cooperation with countries of origin \r\nand transit. Finally, the issue of ensuring the social \r\nand economic inclusion of legal migrants is equally \r\nimportant and deserves our full attention. Greece has \r\nreaffirmed its commitment to ensuring the full and \r\neffective implementation of the New York Declaration \r\nfor Refugees and Migrants and its annexes, adopted \r\nby the Assembly at its seventy-first session. We also \r\nemphasize our commitment to working in the context \r\nof the global compact for safe, orderly and regular \r\nmigration to be concluded by 2018.\r\nI would like to assure the Assembly that, as a \r\nfounding Member of the Organization, Greece will \r\nlend it its unfailing support as the United Nations \r\nworks to rise to the task of creating a more peaceful \r\nand prosperous future, with justice and solidarity for \r\nall, especially for generations to come.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Maxine Pamela Ometa McClean, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and Foreign Trade of Barbados.\r\nMs. McClean (Barbados): On behalf of my \r\ndelegation, I would like to congratulate the President on \r\nhis election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session and to assure him that he has the full \r\nsupport and cooperation of the Barbados delegation as \r\nhe undertakes his important duties. I would also like to \r\ntake this opportunity to commend his predecessor in the \r\npresidency, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his able leadership \r\nof the Assembly during the seventy-first session. He \r\nhas been a worthy exemplar of the valuable contribution \r\nthat small island developing States (SIDS) can make to \r\ninternational organizations, and we are pleased that he \r\nwill continue to serve the international community.\r\nThe theme of this year’s general debate, “Focusing \r\non people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet”, is a reminder of the purposes \r\nand principles that the Organization has embraced \r\nfrom its inception and that are enshrined in the Charter \r\nof the United Nations. It brings into sharp focus our \r\nresponsibility to pursue the best interests of the people \r\nwho occupy planet Earth. For if we fail to advance the \r\ncauses of security, sustainable development and human \r\nrights together, none of them will succeed.\r\nI stand before this organ for the eighth time. On \r\neach occasion that I have addressed the nations gathered \r\nhere, I have issued a caution about the ramifications of \r\nunchecked climate change and highlighted the existential \r\nthreat facing vulnerable small island developing States \r\nsuch as Barbados. In his first address to the General \r\nAssembly, in 2008 (see A/63/PV.12), the then Prime \r\nMinister of Barbados, the late David Thompson, \r\ndescribed the Caribbean as a region at the epicentre \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 13/34\r\nof the global climate crisis. Citing scientific evidence \r\nand the devastating effects of climate change that were \r\nalready evident in the region, he told the Assembly that \r\nfailure to take urgent, ambitious and decisive action \r\nwould be nothing short of reckless indifference.\r\nSeven years later, the current Prime Minister of \r\nBarbados, Mr. Freundel Stuart, reminded the world that\r\n“none of the nations represented in this Assembly \r\nwill enjoy sustainable prosperity if we continue to \r\nabuse the environment that we hold in sacred trust \r\nfor future generations. [...] The very existence of \r\nsmall island States like those in the Caribbean and \r\nthe Pacific could be imperilled if current trends are \r\nnot halted or reversed.” (A/66/PV.22, p. 45)\r\nMany leaders from small island developing States \r\nhave also consistently warned of the inherent danger \r\nof inaction, or insufficient action, to reduce global \r\nemissions. Such failures to act imperil lives, livelihoods \r\nand the very existence of sovereign States. Year after \r\nyear, our leaders have warned of the escalating costs \r\nof responding to the effects of climate change and \r\nof the fact that decades of development gains could \r\neasily be washed away in a few hours by an extreme \r\nweather event. We have also endured the persistent and \r\nfrustrating challenge of gaining access to the resources \r\nwe need to strengthen our resilience and protect our \r\npeoples from the ravages of climate change. That is of \r\ncourse owing to a narrow focus on per capita income on \r\nthe part of donors and international development banks \r\nand agencies.\r\nThe clarion call from the Caribbean has been \r\nignored, and today we are witnessing the results of that \r\nreckless indifference. I regret the fact that I must today \r\nreport not merely the potential threat that climate change \r\nposes to the globe, but rather its destructive impact. \r\nI am referring in particular to the utter devastation \r\nthat we are seeing in several small island developing \r\nStates in the Caribbean that have been overwhelmed \r\nby an unprecedented wave of hurricanes. On Saturday, \r\n16 September, when I arrived in New York, the people \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda and of the Caribbean were \r\nworking feverishly to restore some semblance of order \r\nto the islands shattered by Irma, the ninth named \r\nhurricane of the 2017 season. A mere two days later, in \r\nthe early hours of Monday, I read with horror the pleas \r\nof the Prime Minister of Dominica when he reached out \r\nto the world to share the trauma he was experiencing \r\nas his small island was ravaged by the brutal force of \r\nnature from the eleventh hurricane in a season that has \r\nnot yet ended. By the grace of God, Barbados has so far \r\nbeen spared, but we in the Caribbean are one family. We \r\nare brothers and sisters, and when one of us is hurting \r\nwe all feel the pain.\r\nFor much of the Caribbean, tourism is the major \r\neconomic sector, and it has been built on the premise \r\nof providing the world with a zone of peace and \r\nhealth. The threat of disease must be avoided. One \r\npossible consequence of the recent f loods and serious \r\ninfrastructural damage in the region is the outbreak \r\nof disease. Our ability to detect and respond to such \r\nbiological threats must be strengthened. There must \r\nbe bilateral and multilateral cooperation in order to \r\nminimize and eliminate such threats, and a focus on \r\nbiosecurity must be part of our response. There must \r\nbe attention paid to a global health security agenda. For \r\nBarbados, as an island State, the ocean is a priority. \r\nOcean governance and the promotion and conservation \r\nof marine resources therefore represent one of our \r\nprimary concerns.\r\nThe road to recovery and reconstruction for \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Dominica and the other islands \r\naffected by this devastating hurricane season will be \r\nlong and difficult. I take comfort in the spirit, will and \r\ndetermination of the Caribbean people. We are down but \r\nnot defeated. Our neighbours in the Caribbean affected \r\nby the recent hurricanes can be assured of the full and \r\nunconditional support and solidarity of the Government \r\nand the people of Barbados. However, our friends in the \r\ninternational community must support the Caribbean \r\nregion on its journey to rebuild the affected islands. \r\nWe are all morally obligated to do so. In that regard, \r\nI call on the President of the World Bank and on the \r\nSecretary-General to convene an international pledging \r\nconference on the recovery and reconstruction of the \r\nCaribbean islands affected by Hurricanes Irma and \r\nMaria. I urge all Member States to support the recovery \r\nand rebuilding of the Caribbean.\r\nFor Barbados and other SIDS, whether in the \r\nCaribbean, the Pacific, Asia or Africa, climate change \r\nis a matter of life and death. It is not an issue for sterile \r\ndebates and endless meetings. For our people, it is \r\nabout the loss of life and livelihood. For our economies, \r\nheavily dependent on tourism, it is about a cycle of \r\nconstant recovery and rebuilding, which is a serious \r\nimpediment to sustainable development. Barbados \r\nremains committed to ambitious action on climate \r\nchange. We continue to support the implementation of \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n14/34 17-29728\r\nthe Paris Agreement on Climate Change, and we view \r\nthe Secretary-General’s proposal for a climate summit \r\nin 2019 as an important opportunity to take stock and \r\ngive additional impetus where necessary. Barbados’s \r\nsupport for global action on climate change is one \r\npart of its overall policy of promoting and protecting \r\nthe environment. We have taken concrete steps \r\ntowards building a resource-efficient green economy \r\nthat is integrated into our national framework for \r\nsustainable development.\r\nBarbados would like to take this opportunity to \r\nconvey its solidarity with the Government and the \r\npeople of Mexico, who are suffering the painful effects \r\nof two deadly earthquakes in quick succession.\r\nA key element of this year’s theme is striving \r\nfor peace. Barbados is a democratic, peace-loving \r\nnation. Last year my country celebrated the fiftieth \r\nanniversary of its independence, which was gained \r\nthrough negotiation and mutual agreement. We cherish \r\nand nurture our political and social stability, based \r\non our history of more than 375 years of unbroken \r\nparliamentary Government. We believe that peace is \r\nan indispensable prerequisite for sustainable human, \r\nsocial and economic development. For us, it is an \r\nessential pillar that supports the national mission of the \r\nGovernment of Barbados, which is based on achieving \r\nsustainable economic and social development for the \r\nnation, protecting the environment, maintaining good \r\ngovernance and strengthening our citizens’ security. \r\nWe are committed to inclusive development as a means \r\nof achieving lasting peace and stability at the national \r\nand international levels.\r\nWe regret that there can be no peace of mind for the \r\npeople of the Caribbean who must rebuild their lives \r\nand livelihoods. But the mission of the United Nations \r\nis to secure global peace. We were reminded by the \r\nSecretary-General at the very start of our deliberations \r\nthat “[w]e are a world in pieces. We need to be a world at \r\npeace” (see A/72/PV.3). Each and every member of the \r\ninternational community has an obligation to support \r\nefforts and take action to create an environment in which \r\npeace can f lourish. The countries of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean have declared the Caribbean as a zone \r\nof peace. I take this opportunity to express Barbados’s \r\nunwavering support to the protection and preservation \r\nof the territorial integrity of our Caribbean Community \r\nsister countries Guyana and Belize.\r\nBarbados joins other States Members of the United \r\nNations in the effort to collectively address the many \r\nother diverse challenges to which the international \r\ncommunity must find and implement solutions. In the \r\npast few years, the countries represented here have \r\nmade historic international commitments, including \r\nthe SIDS Accelerated Modalities of Action (SAMOA) \r\nPathway, the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nand the Paris Climate Change Agreement. As an \r\ninternational community, we must now take action \r\nto implement those commitments if the destruction I \r\ndiscussed earlier in my statement is to be addressed.\r\nIn recognition of the fact that our citizens are our \r\nmost precious resource, we have been resolute in taking a \r\npath of development that is people-centred. Our national \r\npolicy framework aligns naturally with the philosophy \r\nguiding the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, \r\nand that has facilitated our implementation efforts. The \r\nPrime Minister of Barbados has clearly emphasized the \r\npriority that Barbados accords the implementation of \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including \r\nby appointing a permanent secretary in his office \r\nwith a mandate and special responsibility to lead the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda at the national level.\r\nBarbados has been a consistent and vocal \r\nadvocate for the treatment of SIDS as a special case \r\nfor sustainable development because of their inherent \r\nnatural vulnerabilities. There is a pressing need for the \r\ninternational community to address the specific needs \r\nand interests of SIDS in a holistic manner. They will \r\nalso need effective multisectoral partnerships to assist \r\nthem in implementing the SDGs.\r\nBarbados welcomes the ongoing efforts of the \r\nUnited Nations to focus international attention on \r\nchallenges to our oceans and on encouraging the \r\ninternational community to take meaningful steps to \r\nprotect the marine environment. I was pleased to head \r\nthe Barbados delegation to the Ocean Conference in \r\nJune, and I am committed to ensuring our continued \r\nactive participation on the issue. Barbados is interested \r\nin working with United Nations agencies and other \r\ninternational partners to develop an ocean economy \r\ntrade strategy, as well as effective systems for managing \r\nour fish stocks.\r\nBarbados has built an enviable record on the \r\nbasis of its promotion of social development. Since \r\nour independence, successive Administrations have \r\ncommitted to targeted social policies focused on the \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 15/34\r\npeople of Barbados. Substantial investment has been \r\nmade in sectors such as education and health in order \r\nto develop a skilled, healthy and productive population. \r\nThe result of that investment has been a significant \r\nimprovement in Barbadians’ quality of life over the \r\nyears, borne out in the United Nations Development \r\nProgramme’s Human Development Index and other \r\nindices that focus on transparency, corruption, gender \r\nbalance and human rights, among other things.\r\nPromoting and protecting the human rights of all \r\nBarbadians are primary concerns for the Government \r\nof Barbados. That is in keeping with our commitment \r\nto a human rights-based approach to development and \r\nour adherence to the principles of good governance and \r\nthe rule of law, as well as to ensuring that our people \r\nhave the highest levels of civil, political, economic, \r\nsocial and cultural rights. We pay special attention \r\nto the rights of the vulnerable, including children, \r\nwomen and persons with disabilities. With regard to \r\nthe rights of persons with disabilities, my Government, \r\ntogether with civil society, continues to make progress \r\nin promoting their full integration into mainstream \r\nsociety. Barbados wishes to participate more fully in \r\nthe activities of the international community on issues \r\nof inclusiveness, and are therefore pleased to present \r\nMs. Kerryann Ifill as a candidate for membership of the \r\nCommittee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities \r\nfor the 2019-2022 term. Senator Ifill is the youngest \r\nPresident of the Senate ever appointed in Barbados, the \r\nfirst female and the first person with a disability ever to \r\nhold that office, and her candidature has been endorsed \r\nby the Caribbean Community.\r\nThe Caribbean Community has been at the forefront \r\nof United Nations initiatives to address the problem \r\nof non-communicable diseases. During this session, \r\nBarbados will work with regional and other partners \r\nto bring a greater focus to the growing challenge of \r\nchildhood obesity, a serious problem that could become \r\nthe next major development challenge. Barbados looks \r\nforward to the convening of the General Assembly’s \r\nthird high-level meeting on non-communicable \r\ndiseases, scheduled for next year. I encourage Member \r\nStates to participate actively in it, as it will be an \r\ninvaluable opportunity to strengthen our action on this \r\nimportant issue and move closer to our goal of improved \r\nhealth for our peoples.\r\nBarbados would like to take this opportunity to \r\nonce again express its deep concern about the possibility \r\nof its being penalized for any success that it may \r\nachieve in its development efforts. Our categorization \r\nas a middle-income country, with the concomitant \r\nrestrictions on our access to international development \r\nassistance and concessionary financing, is unfair \r\nand does nothing to advance the cause of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. We reiterate our call to the international \r\ncommunity to create an enabling global environment \r\nand partnership for development. Countries such as \r\nmine require assistance in building economic resilience; \r\nwe do not need challenges such as those presented by \r\nde-risking, blacklisting and indebtedness.\r\nTransnational crime is a major threat to international \r\npeace and security. It can take many forms — trafficking \r\nin illegal drugs, trafficking in persons, the illegal \r\ntransfer of small arms and light weapons, and money-\r\nlaundering. All present significant threats to our \r\nsecurity, and Barbados reiterates its commitment to \r\nprotecting the security of its people. We will remain \r\nactively engaged in cooperative mechanisms aimed at \r\nconfronting and addressing such challenges.\r\nBarbados welcomes the convening of the third \r\nConference of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty \r\n(ATT). We encourage all States parties to take action \r\nto implement the Treaty and we further acknowledge \r\nthe nexus between the ATT and the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals, and their contribution to the \r\npromotion of peaceful and inclusive societies.\r\nThe long-standing economic embargo on Cuba \r\ncontinues to be a cause for serious concern on \r\nBarbados’s part. We join the overwhelming majority \r\nof States Members of the United Nations in opposing \r\nthat unilateral action and encourage constructive \r\nengagement between the two sides.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to emphasize Barbados’s \r\nunwavering commitment to the United Nations \r\nand the principle of multilateralism. If we are truly \r\ncommitted to a decent life for all, people everywhere \r\nmust be heard, including those in small States such as \r\nBarbados. We agree that there is need for reform in the \r\nUnited Nations system. However, even as the United \r\nNations is working to reform, and thereby better equip \r\nitself to respond to today’s global challenges, due care \r\nmust be taken to ensure that the process is inclusive and \r\ntransparent. No Member State, particularly the most \r\nvulnerable, should be excluded in the restructuring \r\nprocess. Barbados supports the view that a spirit of \r\ncooperation and dialogue should be the foundation for \r\nour interaction at the multilateral level. Cooperation \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n16/34 17-29728\r\nand dialogue represent the best means of achieving our \r\ninternational goals and objectives.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Highness \r\nSheikh Abdullah Bin Zayed Al Nahyan, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates.\r\nSheikh Al Nahyan (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like to begin by congratulating the \r\nPresident on his leadership of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-second session. We are confident that his \r\ndeep experience in international affairs will contribute \r\nto the Assembly’s success, and we stand ready to provide \r\nhim with all the support and cooperation he may need. \r\nI would also like to thank his predecessor, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, for his stewardship of the previous session.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to express \r\nmy country’s appreciation for the tireless efforts of the \r\nSecretary-General to reform the work of the United \r\nNations in conflict prevention and the achievement of \r\npeace and security. We fully support his vision, which \r\nrequires the international community to cooperate more \r\nclosely on existing and emerging global challenges.\r\nThe foreign policy of the United Arab Emirates \r\nis guided by principles consistent with the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the provisions of international \r\nlaw — a spirit of partnership, support for the rule of \r\nlaw, good neighbourliness and non-interference in the \r\ninternal affairs of other States. They lead us to support \r\na stronger role for the United Nations, along with \r\nreform of its entities and systems, so that it can fulfil its \r\nmandate to maintain international peace and security \r\nand help countries achieve development and prosperity.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates works hard and \r\nresponsibly within its region and beyond to promote the \r\nstability and development of Arab countries and tackle \r\nthe destruction wrought in our region by wars that have \r\nleft total devastation in their wake. We see security \r\nand stability as key to the advancement of nations and \r\npeoples, a promising future for younger generations \r\nand a decent life for all. Our collective priority must be \r\nto promote peace and stability.\r\nDespite serious regional and international efforts, \r\nour region continues to suffer from crises whose \r\ncauses include extremism and terrorism, persistent \r\ninterference by States in one another’s internal \r\naffairs, aggressive and expansionist policies driven by \r\nhegemonic ambitions, and regimes that seek influence \r\nby providing support to extremist and terrorist groups, \r\nwith the goal of undermining Governments’ legitimacy. \r\nWe must protect that legitimacy and prevent the spread \r\nof chaos and conflict throughout the region and the \r\nworld. These crises have had enormous costs in terms \r\nof human life, the displacement of millions and the \r\ndestruction of infrastructure. If the situation persists, \r\nit will generate only more violence and devastation and \r\ndeplete economic and cultural resources, not just in our \r\nregion but all over the world. There is no doubt that \r\nwe as an international community have achieved great \r\nprogress in confronting security and humanitarian \r\nthreats, but more can be done to restore stability in \r\nthe Arab world. The United Arab Emirates therefore \r\nbelieves that we should take the following initial steps \r\nin the region.\r\nFirst, we should safeguard the progress that has \r\nalready been made on development and counter any \r\nhindrances to our collective peacebuilding efforts, or \r\nwe will be reduced solely to managing conflicts. That \r\napplies particularly to Libya, Syria, Yemen and Somalia, \r\ncountries where comprehensive political solutions are \r\npossible and stability can be restored. But that can be \r\nachieved only if we end external interference in Arab \r\naffairs and suppress all forms of support to extremist \r\nand terrorist groups. In that regard, we support United \r\nNations efforts to bring the parties to those conflicts \r\nto the negotiating table and to achieve comprehensive \r\npolitical solutions to the crises in our region.\r\nSecondly, we must unite in firm and wholehearted \r\nrejection of extremism and terrorism in all their \r\nmanifestations. That is the only way to confront and \r\neradicate those scourges. We believe that the Arab-\r\nIslamic-American summit in Riyadh was historic by \r\nany standard. It attracted an unprecedented level of \r\nattendance at the highest levels, including the important \r\nparticipation of the President of the United States. Its \r\noutcome demonstrated that the Arab and Islamic world \r\nhas taken a firm stand against the ideological roots of \r\nterrorism. We believe that, while eliminating this threat \r\nfrom our Arab region is a difficult task, the campaigns \r\nto liberate such ancient and storied Arab cities as Mosul \r\nin Iraq and Mukalla in Yemen from the grip of terrorist \r\norganizations have shown that we can achieve a great \r\ndeal if we work together in combating extremism \r\nand terrorism.\r\nThirdly, we must take collective action to identify \r\ncountries that support and finance terrorism and \r\nhold them accountable. That is why the United Arab \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 17/34\r\nEmirates, together with its close allies the Kingdom \r\nof Saudi Arabia, the Kingdom of Bahrain and the \r\nArab Republic of Egypt, has taken measures aimed at \r\nstopping Qatar’s support for extremism and terrorism \r\nand forcing it to abandon policies that have destabilized \r\nthe region. We are committed to protecting our national \r\ninterests, the security of the Arabian Gulf and the \r\nstability of our region. The alliances between certain \r\nparties in our region with organizations or entities \r\nwhose goal is to undermine peace and security in the \r\nArab region and the world are unacceptable. That is \r\na gamble in which we will all be losers. Let us stand \r\nunited against those who finance, promote and justify \r\nextremism and terrorism. We have a clear choice, and \r\nthere is no alternative to combating terrorism in all its \r\nmanifestations and facing down all its perpetrators, \r\nwithout exception. We must have zero tolerance for \r\nthose who spread violence, fear and destruction among \r\ninnocent people or provide support and safe havens to \r\nterrorist groups. Together with its friends in the region, \r\nmy country has therefore taken sovereign measures, in \r\nline with international law, with a view to protecting \r\nArab security and standing against Qatar’s support \r\nto terrorism.\r\nFourthly, we must promote compassion, tolerance \r\nand inclusion, because today more than ever the \r\nArab region needs those values in order to counter \r\nthe misleading messages and ideologies spread by \r\nextremists and terrorist groups, especially through \r\nsocial media. My country is working with regional and \r\ninternational partners to establish mechanisms that can \r\nremind our young people of our shared human values \r\nand counter the rhetoric of terrorism. Specifically, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates has established and hosts \r\nspecialized institutions such as the Sawab Centre, \r\nthe Hedayah International Centre of Excellence for \r\nCountering Violent Extremism and the Muslim Council \r\nof Elders, whose purpose is to demonstrate the peaceful \r\nnature of our Islamic religion and constitute a forum for \r\npromoting peace in Muslim societies. We have learned \r\nfrom experience that we must expose extremism and \r\nterrorism and the rhetoric surrounding them in order \r\nto defeat them intellectually and provide an alternative \r\nnarrative based on the principle of peaceful coexistence \r\nand tolerance. At the same time, such institutions \r\npromote a culture of peaceful coexistence and \r\ntolerance. It is regrettable, however, that some countries \r\nare funding media platforms that encourage violence, \r\nincite hatred and sectarianism and provide a forum \r\nfor the murderous ideologies of terrorism. History has \r\nrepeatedly shown that catastrophic consequences await \r\nthose who follow such paths.\r\nOur international efforts to achieve peace in our \r\nregion will not be successful if we fail to end the Israeli \r\noccupation of Palestinian and Arab territory, which has \r\ncontinued for seven decades. The situation makes young \r\npeople vulnerable to exploitation by terrorist groups \r\nthat claim that they are fighting only for liberation and \r\nto realize their aspirations.\r\nIran’s hostile and expansionist policies continue to \r\nbe the common factor in all the crises that our region \r\nhas experienced, and a real obstacle to any concrete \r\nprogress in resolving them. Iran interferes in the \r\ninternal affairs of other States and arms and supports \r\nterrorist groups such as the Houthis and Hizbullah, \r\nas well as groups and cells in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, \r\nLebanon, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait. Iran has \r\nnot only blatantly violated the principle of sovereignty \r\nbut has continued to exploit the crises in the Arab world \r\nin order to undermine regional security and incite \r\nand fuel conflict. It must realize that only peaceful \r\ncoexistence, based on mutual respect for sovereignty, \r\nis a viable basis for harmonious relations in the region.\r\nFrom this rostrum, we reaffirm our firm position \r\non the issue of and our legitimate right to sovereignty \r\nover the three islands of Greater Tunbs, Lesser Tunbs \r\nand Abu Musa, which Iran has occupied in violation of \r\ninternational law and the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nWe will not abandon our demand that Iran return the \r\noccupied islands to their rightful owners, through \r\nvoluntary or other peaceful means and in accordance \r\nwith the resolutions that have been adopted in that \r\nregard, together with the rulings of the International \r\nCourt of Justice.\r\nTwo years have passed since the signing of the \r\nnuclear agreement with Iran, with no sign of change \r\nin its hostile behaviour. It continues to develop its \r\nnuclear programme and violates the letter and spirit \r\nof the agreement. We therefore support enhanced \r\ncontrols on Iran’s nuclear programme and continued \r\nassessment of the agreement and its provisions. We \r\nview North Korea’s similarly provocative behaviour, \r\nthrough its continued development of its nuclear \r\nprogramme and ballistic missiles, as having only one \r\npurpose — acquiring further destructive power with \r\nwhich to threaten peace and stability in its region and \r\nthe rest of the world. Iran and North Korea’s aggressive \r\npolicies are not consistent with their membership in an \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n18/34 17-29728\r\ninternational organization whose primary concern is \r\nthe maintenance of international peace and security.\r\nIf we are to restore security in our region and \r\nprotect our peoples from conflicts and extremism, \r\nwe must make development, in both its human and \r\nstrategic dimensions, our top priority. We must create \r\nopportunities and hope for younger generations so \r\nthat they can look forward to a better tomorrow with \r\noptimism and confidence. My country is committed \r\nto achieving economic and human progress and has \r\ncontributed to rehabilitation and reconstruction projects \r\nin conflict-affected countries in order to enable them to \r\nrestore security and stability.\r\nWe continue our humanitarian approach to \r\nalleviating the suffering of refugees. We support \r\nrefugees internationally and regionally, with a view to \r\nprotecting them and improving their living conditions \r\nby providing humanitarian and development assistance. \r\nHowever, we would like to stress that managing crises \r\nby providing such assistance alone is not a sustainable \r\nsolution if we fail to address their root causes. In that \r\nregard, we would like to reiterate the importance of \r\nensuring that the United Nations can arrive at solutions \r\nto humanitarian and political crises and address their \r\ngrave implications, with a particular focus on recent \r\nacts of violence and ethnic cleansing such as have \r\nbeen committed in Myanmar against the Rohingya. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates condemns the violence, \r\ndisplacement and collective punishment that have been \r\nvisited on the Rohingya and will continue to provide \r\nthem with assistance in order to reduce their suffering.\r\nIn that context, I should also mention the Houthi \r\nrebels’ obstinate rejection of a political settlement to the \r\ncrisis and the humanitarian initiatives in Yemen, which \r\nis preventing progress from being made on resolving the \r\nissue. We will nonetheless continue to work diligently \r\nand with determination on the political and humanitarian \r\nprocesses in Yemen, alongside our friends and brothers \r\nand under Saudi Arabia’s wise leadership, with the goal \r\nof addressing the humanitarian and development needs \r\nof the Yemeni people, especially women and children, \r\nand with a view to restoring stability there.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates believes that by looking \r\nto the future, promoting human values, working \r\nto achieve human development and responding to \r\nthe aspirations of young people, we can create the \r\nfoundations for further development and prosperity. My \r\ncountry has moved beyond the stage of establishing its \r\ninfrastructure and fulfilling basic needs, including by \r\nproviding health, nutrition and education services, and \r\nhas adopted a model based on the principles of good \r\ngovernance and values of tolerance and on its vision for \r\nbuilding a contented society. We have also created a safe \r\nenvironment that can enable women and young people \r\nto fulfil their dreams and ambitions while engaging in \r\ntheir country’s development. As a result, we have been \r\nable to pioneer innovations and other groundbreaking \r\nachievements and have become a beacon of hope for \r\nyounger generations throughout the region. We are \r\ncognizant that our greatest challenge is to make our \r\ndevelopment sustainable and prepare ourselves for the \r\npost-oil era. That will be vital to our survival.\r\nThe United Arab Emirates considers its values and \r\nprinciples to be a human and historic legacy celebrated \r\nand passed on by one generation to another. We have \r\ntherefore declared 2018 the year of Zayed, in memory \r\nand recognition of the achievements of the founding \r\nfather of the United Arab Emirates and with the aim \r\nof enshrining his values as we continue his journey to \r\nbuild and advance our nation.\r\nWe stand at a historic juncture. On the one hand, we \r\nhave those who pursue peace, development, modernity \r\nand the future, while on the other we have those who \r\nhave chosen darkness, destruction, sabotage and chaos. \r\nIn that essential and just confrontation, we must stand \r\nunited. Our goal must be the eradication of extremism \r\nand terrorism and the elimination of the forces that are \r\ntearing our region apart. We will then have a clear path \r\ntowards a brighter future that is full of hope.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Tsend Munkh-Orgil, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Mongolia.\r\nMr. Munkh-Orgil (Mongolia): At the outset, I \r\njoin previous speakers in expressing our solidarity and \r\nsympathy with the Government of Mexico and its people \r\nand with the Caribbean countries and the United States, \r\nwhich have all been hit by devastating natural disasters \r\nin the past few days. Natural disasters across the globe \r\nhave become more frequent, and their consequences \r\neven more catastrophic. By some calculations, their \r\nnumbers have quadrupled worldwide since 1970. The \r\nneed for better national and local readiness, and for \r\nstronger regional and international cooperation, is \r\ngrowing. As part of those efforts, Mongolia will host \r\nan Asian ministerial conference in July 2018 aimed at \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 19/34\r\nimplementing the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk \r\nReduction more effectively.\r\nMongolia has been exposed to multiple \r\nenvironmental challenges as a result of climate change, \r\nincluding desertification, drought, land degradation \r\nand wild forest fires. The main goals of the Government \r\naction plan for the period 2016 to 2020 are therefore \r\npreserving a balanced ecosystem, protecting natural \r\nresources and ensuring their appropriate use and \r\nrehabilitation, and promoting green economic growth. \r\nAll of us, developed and developing nations alike, \r\nare committed to working together to address newly \r\nemerging issues induced by climate change. For its \r\npart, Mongolia has developed its intended nationally \r\ndetermined contribution and will work to implement its \r\ntarget of reducing greenhouse-gas emissions by 14 per \r\ncent by 2030.\r\nThe theme of this year’s general debate, “Focusing \r\non people: Striving for peace and a decent life for \r\nall on a sustainable planet”, captures the main thrust \r\nof the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. \r\nIf the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are \r\nimplemented, they will transform our world. But as \r\nimportant as the SDGs are, we should not overlook \r\nthe compelling need to fine-tune the overall structure \r\nfor their implementation at the national, regional and \r\nglobal levels. An important step in that direction was \r\ntaken at the July meeting of the High-level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development. Mongolia fully \r\nsupports the Forum’s declaration, which emphasizes \r\nthe importance of fostering peaceful, just and inclusive \r\nsocieties as well as empowering vulnerable people \r\nthrough collective action.\r\nMy country was one of the first to adopt the \r\nSDGs. In February 2016, our Parliament approved \r\nMongolia’s sustainable development agenda for \r\n2030. It envisages Mongolia becoming an upper-\r\nmiddle-income country by 2030, eradicating poverty in \r\nall its forms while preserving an ecological balance and \r\nstrengthening democratic governance. In parallel with \r\nthe 17 SDGs, Mongolia’s Vision 2030 integrates the \r\nthree pillars of development — economic, social and \r\nenvironmental. We have mainstreamed its goals into \r\nour Government action plan for 2016 to 2020 and other \r\nrelevant programmes.\r\nAmong global development priorities, the special \r\nneeds of landlocked developing countries are a top \r\npriority for Mongolia. According to World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) estimates, landlocked developing \r\ncountries’ trade costs amount to applying a 260 per \r\ncent tariff to international trade, and the Office of the \r\nHigh Representative has concluded that on average, \r\nsuch countries’ development is 20 per cent lower than \r\nit would be if they were not landlocked. Mongolia is \r\ncommitted to the effective implementation of the Vienna \r\nProgramme of Action for Landlocked Developing \r\nCountries for the Decade 2014-2024, along with other \r\nlandlocked developing countries. It is gratifying to \r\nnote that, with 10 required ratifications already in \r\nplace, the multilateral agreement establishing an \r\ninternational think tank for countries such as ours will \r\nenter into force on 6 October. The Ulaanbaatar-based \r\ninternational think tank has already begun its research \r\nactivities, thanks to the financial contributions of \r\nthe Mongolian Government and other partners. Once \r\nfully operational, it will further support landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries in their implementation of both \r\nthe Vienna Programme of Action and the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development.\r\nEnhancing connectivity is an urgent priority that \r\nall landlocked developing economies share. Mongolia \r\nacceded to the WTO’s Trade Facilitation Agreement \r\nin 2016. We value the potential of its article 11, on \r\nfreedom of transit for reducing trade costs and boosting \r\ntrade for landlocked developing countries, which can \r\nhelp us integrate into global value chains and make \r\nthe transition from landlocked to land-linked status. \r\nIn order to further improve market access to its main \r\ntrading partners, Mongolia is studying the feasibility \r\nof free trade agreements with the Eurasian Economic \r\nUnion, the People’s Republic of China and the Republic \r\nof Korea. An economic partnership agreement is \r\nalready in place with Japan.\r\nIn order to enhance regional integration in our \r\nimmediate region of North-East Asia, Mongolia \r\nis actively engaged with its neighbours on transit, \r\ntransportation and infrastructure development. In \r\nJuly 2015, the Presidents of Mongolia, China and \r\nRussia signed an agreement to develop a programme \r\non the China-Mongolia-Russia economic corridor. It \r\nwill focus on the implementation of joint projects to \r\nincrease trade turnover, ensure competitiveness in \r\ngoods supply, facilitate cross-border transportation and \r\ndevelop infrastructure. In August, we agreed on our \r\npriority projects, and we are in the process of setting up \r\nmechanisms to coordinate the actual implementation of \r\nthe economic corridor.\r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n20/34 17-29728\r\nIn December 2016, China, Mongolia and the \r\nRussian Federation signed an intergovernmental \r\nagreement on international road transport along the \r\nAsian highway network, marking another major step \r\nin trilateral cooperation. Mongolia is keen to work \r\ntogether with our two neighbours and other partners to \r\nimprove rail, road, air and energy networks and pipeline \r\ninfrastructure, and to increase access to the sea.\r\nMongolia’s State energy policy, adopted in 2015, \r\nset the ambitious goal of producing 30 per cent of its \r\nenergy demands through renewable resources by 2030. \r\nOur solar and wind resources are estimated at 7,000 \r\nand 5,000 terawatts, respectively. With those resources, \r\nMongolia has basically an unlimited potential for \r\nexporting clean energy to countries in our region. \r\nWe are working with our partners to implement the \r\nGobi Tech and Asian Super Grid projects to supply \r\nrenewable energy to North-East Asia. They offer \r\ncountries in the region a wide range of economic, social \r\nand environmental benefits, including energy security, \r\njob creation and the reduction of carbon-dioxide \r\nemissions. We look forward to working with bilateral \r\nand multilateral partners on those important projects.\r\nWhen the global community set out on the collective \r\njourney towards the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, it pledged to leave no one behind. The \r\nSDGs have made the reduction of inequalities among \r\npeople — including the disadvantaged, vulnerable and \r\nmarginalized — a clear priority for the international \r\ncommunity. Sustainable social development is a \r\nprominent part of Mongolia’s Vision 2030 for the SDGs. \r\nIt sets out goals aimed at ensuring gender equality, \r\nimproving the quality of health-care services and \r\naccess to them, creating safe, healthy living conditions \r\nfor its citizens, providing everyone with a high-quality \r\neducation, ending all forms of poverty and enlarging the \r\nmiddle-income class. But while we cannot achieve the \r\ntimely and effective implementation of the sustainable \r\ndevelopment agenda without peace and security, peace \r\nis being threatened on a number of fronts.\r\nMongolia is deeply concerned about the escalating \r\ntension in North-East Asia. We strongly oppose the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea’s destabilization \r\nof regional security by conducting repeated nuclear \r\ntests and launching ballistic missiles in defiance of \r\nthe international community’s will and in violation \r\nof the relevant Security Council resolutions. As a \r\ncountry that has had nuclear-weapon-free-zone status \r\nfor the past 25 years, Mongolia reiterates its principled \r\nposition that the Korean peninsula should be free of \r\nnuclear weapons, and we urge the parties concerned \r\nto refrain from any action that could heighten tensions \r\nin North-East Asia and to work to resolve the issue \r\nthrough peaceful means. In our view, the only way to \r\ndo so is through dialogue. One possible avenue for that \r\ncould be the Ulaanbaatar Dialogue on Northeast Asian \r\nSecurity, which we initiated in 2013. We held its fourth \r\nInternational Conference in Ulaanbaatar in June. The \r\nDialogue discusses not only security issues in North-\r\nEast Asia but also potential energy and environmental \r\nprojects, and as such is an open mechanism that can \r\nembrace the participation of every country in North-\r\nEast Asia.\r\nThe current tensions have only deepened the \r\nconcerns we all have about nuclear weapons. Mongolia \r\nwelcomed the Assembly’s adoption, on 7 July, of the \r\nTreaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons. So long as \r\nnuclear weapons exist, the risk of their use will persist. \r\nThe only guarantee of the non-use of nuclear weapons is \r\ntheir total elimination. Pending the achievement of that \r\nultimate goal, it will be critical to ensure the entry into \r\nforce of the Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty as \r\nsoon as possible, as well as vigorous implementation of \r\nthe Action Plan agreed in the final document of the 2010 \r\nReview Conference of the Parties to the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. We must also \r\nput an end to the protracted stalemate in the Conference \r\non Disarmament.\r\nTerrorism continues to pose a grave threat to \r\ninternational peace and security, and terrorist activities \r\naround the globe remain unabated. We commend the \r\nSecretary-General’s establishment of a new United \r\nNations Office of Counter-Terrorism to provide strategic \r\nleadership for global counter-terrorism efforts.\r\nIn the twenty-first century, it is disheartening to \r\nsee the world facing the largest refugee crisis since \r\nthe Second World War. An unprecedented number \r\nof people, including the Rohingya Muslims, have \r\nbeen forced to f lee their homes. The horror of the \r\nhuman tragedy that has unfolded during such forced \r\ndisplacements must stop. The current humanitarian \r\nemergencies require comprehensive responses that \r\nshould include three elements — ensuring dignity for \r\nrefugees, supporting host countries and addressing the \r\nroot causes of the problem. It is the shared responsibility \r\nof all of us to promote the safe movement of persons \r\nand to respect international refugee law, human rights \r\nlaw and humanitarian law. Similarly, large movements \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 21/34\r\nof migrants require equally close attention. We look \r\nforward to the adoption of a global compact for safe, \r\norderly and regular migration in 2018. We hope it will \r\nbe a critical tool for protecting the safety and human \r\nrights of all migrants, regardless of their migratory \r\nstatus, and for strengthening global governance on \r\ninternational migration.\r\nToday the role of United Nations peacekeeping \r\nis growing tremendously. Mongolia is proud to be \r\ncontributing to its support for the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations. In the \r\npast decade, Mongolia has dispatched more than 15,000 \r\nBlue Helmets to a number of hotspots and is currently \r\none of the 30 largest troop- and police-contributing \r\ncountries in the world. Mongolian peacekeepers are \r\nknown for their dedication, skills and community-\r\nfriendly behaviour in peacekeeping and reconstruction \r\nefforts. We intend to further enhance our contribution \r\nby providing engineering and special units to United \r\nNations peacekeeping operations.\r\nAs a member of the Human Rights Council, we \r\nreaffirm our firm commitment to eradicating the \r\ndeath penalty, torture and other kinds of inhumane \r\nand degrading treatment. Four days ago, together with \r\nArgentina and the European Union, we hosted a high-\r\nlevel event to launch the Alliance for Torture-Free \r\nTrade, a global alliance to end trade in products used to \r\ncarry out torture and capital punishment.\r\nStrengthening democratic and open societies \r\ngoverned by the rule of law is a long-standing priority \r\nfor Mongolia. Accountable institutions, access to justice \r\nfor everyone and the significant reduction of corruption \r\nare all key ingredients of sustainable development as \r\nenvisaged in SDG 16.\r\nAt a time when the world is facing myriad global \r\nchallenges, it is unsettling to have multilateralism \r\nquestioned. In our globalized world, no State can \r\ntackle today’s challenges alone. Global issues require \r\nglobal solutions. As a guarantor of security for all \r\nnations, large and small, the United Nations is a centre \r\nof multilateralism, but we must enhance its role as a \r\ncentre of effective multilateralism. We commend the \r\nSecretary-General’s vision of the United Nations as an \r\ninstrument for a surge in diplomacy for peace, and his \r\nrecent establishment of the High-Level Advisory Board \r\non Mediation could not be more timely. Its 18 eminent \r\nmembers bring to it an unparalleled spectrum of skills \r\nand, most important, the credibility that is essential \r\nfor mediation.\r\nIn conclusion, I want to reaffirm once again that \r\nMongolia fully supports the Secretary-General’s vision \r\nfor reform that can make the United Nations less \r\nbureaucratic and more efficient, productive and field-\r\noriented. After all, that is the only way that the United \r\nNations can become stronger and more responsive to \r\nthe people it serves.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Aurélien Agbenonci, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand Cooperation of the Republic of Benin.\r\nMr. Agbenonci (Benin) (spoke in French): I would \r\nlike to deliver the following message on behalf of \r\nMr. Patrice Talon, President, Head of State and Head of \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Benin.\r\n“At the outset, I would like to reiterate my warm \r\ncongratulations to the President on his election to \r\nlead the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession and to assure him of my country’s support \r\nin the fulfilment of his mandate. I would also like \r\nto take this opportunity to thank his predecessor, \r\nMr. Peter Thomson, for his efforts. I would like \r\nto once again warmly congratulate Secretary-\r\nGeneral António Guterres and assure him of \r\nour full support and, lastly, to pay tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon.\r\n“I extend my condolences and my sympathies \r\nto the Governments and the peoples of the United \r\nStates, France, Mexico and Sierra Leone and all the \r\ncountries in the Caribbean that have been victims \r\nof recent natural disasters.\r\n“As we move into the active phase of concrete \r\nimplementation of the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, Benin welcomes the theme of this session \r\nof the Assembly, entitled ‘Focusing on people: \r\nStriving for peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet’. This theme corresponds closely \r\nto the guidelines in our Government’s programme \r\nof action, which places humankind and the planet at \r\nthe centre of its concerns. Benin, as members know, \r\nis continuing its efforts to achieve the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals through courageous and \r\nnecessary reforms.\r\n“On 22 September 2016, from this rostrum \r\n(see A/71/PV.14), I affirmed that mass poverty is a \r\nmajor threat to humankind, and on that occasion I \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n22/34 17-29728\r\nexpressed the hope that the determination that led \r\nthe world to adopt the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange could lead us to set up a comprehensive \r\nprogramme for the eradication of mass poverty. \r\nA year later, that appeal is more relevant than \r\never, as the situation in our countries continues \r\nto deteriorate. Thousands of people are forced \r\nto emigrate, in most cases at risk to their lives, \r\nwith, as a corollary, many security and economic \r\nchallenges for host countries, as well as significant \r\nenvironmental consequences. That is why I find \r\nthis theme useful for the sharing of efforts to ensure \r\nsustainable human development and the promotion \r\nof a world that respects the environment.\r\n“Benin has committed to addressing youth \r\nunemployment as a means of eradicating poverty. In \r\naccordance with the road map of the African Union \r\nadopted by the Heads of State and Government in \r\nJanuary 2016, the Government of Benin, in liaison \r\nwith the United Nations, has drawn up a national road \r\nmap to take into account the demographic dividend \r\nin Benin. The Government’s programme of action \r\noutlines a number of projects that, when realized, \r\nwill strengthen sustainable human development.\r\n“The programme, known as Insurance for \r\nStrengthening Human Capital, fits into that \r\ndynamic. Its operationalization will make health \r\ninsurance compulsory for all who live in Benin and \r\nwill make it possible to establish a social protection \r\nsystem for the poorest and most vulnerable. \r\nOur programme of action also attaches great \r\nimportance to the preservation of the environment, \r\nand important environmental protection measures \r\nare included.\r\n“I believe it is important to take this opportunity \r\nto recall Benin’s proposal on 15 November \r\n2016 — during the solemn high-level session of \r\nthe twenty-second meeting of the Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, in Marrakech, \r\nMorocco — to establish an international research \r\ncentre to respond effectively to the effects of \r\nclimate change on agriculture in Africa, in \r\nconjunction with the International Institute of \r\nTropical Agriculture, based in Nigeria. Our hope \r\nis that the appropriate United Nations bodies will \r\nconsider the implications of that proposal, which \r\nwould make it possible to ensure the sustainable \r\ndevelopment of agriculture in Africa.\r\n“We are deeply committed to efforts to combat \r\nclimate change, and we believe that the Paris \r\nAgreement is an indispensable tool for achieving \r\nthat. In that regard, my country supports the \r\nvarious initiatives, particularly those of France, \r\naimed at getting the United Nations to put in place \r\na third generation of fundamental rights that would \r\nbe embodied in a global pact for the environment.\r\n “Our session opens at a time when the world \r\nis facing a multitude of complex challenges. For \r\ndecades the world has also seemed prone to crisis \r\nand in search of meaning. In many parts of the \r\nworld, peace is seriously threatened and the values \r\nof freedom and the rule of law are compromised. \r\nViolent extremism and radicalism weigh heavily on \r\ninternational security and stability.\r\n“The assault on multilateralism, and therefore \r\non the United Nations, is part of that pernicious \r\ntrend that we must reject. That is why, in order to \r\nensure the well-being of African populations and \r\nto address those problems effectively, the African \r\nUnion needs reform more than ever. Benin strongly \r\nsupports the ongoing reform process and very much \r\nwants it to be finalized as soon as ossible.\r\n“Reform of the United Nations, particularly \r\nthe Security Council, must also proceed so as to \r\nincrease the effectiveness of the Organization, \r\nparticularly in the area of peace and security. The \r\ncomposition of the Security Council must be revised \r\nin order to take into account the changes that have \r\ntaken place on the international scene in recent \r\ndecades. We cannot call for respect for democracy \r\nin all countries and, paradoxically, not want it to \r\nbe applied in reforming the Security Council. That \r\nreform, we hope, will make it possible to redress \r\nthe injustice done to Africa, the only continent \r\nnot represented in the category of permanent \r\nmembers of the Council. Benin’s position on this \r\nissue is consistent with that of Africa, as set out in \r\nthe Ezulwini Consensus. The United Nations, and \r\nmore specifically the Security Council, also needs \r\na fresh start.\r\n“The important challenges to be met include the \r\nsettlement of the Palestinian question. The creation \r\nof a Palestinian State as a full Member of the \r\nUnited Nations living in harmony with Israel will \r\nundoubtedly result in a  dynamic that can reduce \r\ntensions in that region. We therefore support the \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 23/34\r\nefforts of the United Nations to achieve that goal, \r\nas well as the initiatives to meet the conditions \r\nlikely to promote an international conference on \r\nthe establishment in the Middle East of a zone free \r\nof nuclear weapons.\r\n“I would like to reiterate our commitment to \r\nstrengthening our contribution to the work of the \r\nUnited Nations and to further working towards \r\nthe effectiveness of peacekeeping operations. \r\nThe signing in Cotonou on 8 February of the \r\nagreement on the status of the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission \r\nin Mali fits into that dynamic.\r\n“I do not wish to end my statement without once \r\nagain affirming the deep attachment of my country, \r\nBenin, to the United Nations, which remains a \r\nunique framework for expression, dialogue and \r\naction, enabling us to cope in a unified manner \r\nwith the immense and complex challenges of our \r\nglobalized world. Multilateralism is an ethical and \r\npolitical imperative for peace. Benin will continue \r\nto work alongside all other peoples to build a more \r\njust, inclusive and fraternal world order.”\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Pehin Lim Jock Seng, Minister at the Prime \r\nMinister’s Office and Second Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Trade of Brunei Darussalam.\r\nMr. Seng (Brunei Darussalam): I have the great \r\nhonour to convey the warm greetings of His Majesty \r\nthe Sultan and Yang Di Pertuan of Negara Brunei \r\nDarussalam to the General Assembly.\r\nWe congratulate Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his \r\nassumption of the presidency of the Assembly at \r\nthis session. We also thank His Excellency Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, who presided over the Assembly with such \r\ndedication during the past year. I also wish to send my \r\nwarm wishes to our Secretary-General, His Excellency \r\nMr. António Guterres, and to praise him for his vision \r\nfor strengthening our Organization.\r\nTwo years ago, Brunei Darussalam proudly joined \r\neveryone in embarking on an extended journey to \r\nachieve a global set of ambitious goals for sustainable \r\ndevelopment. For us, that moment was meaningful. It \r\nsignified our Organization’s relentless efforts to bring \r\ndevelopment and prosperity to all countries, regardless \r\nof their size and status in the world. It also showed us \r\nwhat unity can accomplish.\r\nOur theme sums up who it is we are acting for — it \r\nis our people. It is therefore important to ensure that we \r\nfulfil our promise to them. It is a promise of a future \r\nwhere their hopes and dreams for better livelihoods \r\ncan be realized. That will require our long-term \r\ncommitment and significant investment.\r\nIn Brunei Darussalam, this means more than \r\njust building infrastructure or providing for basic \r\nneeds. It also means raising decent people, people \r\nwho care for their society and are committed to their \r\ncountry’s development and future. That calls for an \r\ninclusive approach, with a priority of focusing on \r\nyouth development. In today’s increasingly competitive \r\nenvironment, Brunei Darussalam firmly believes \r\nthat quality education is the key to building a new \r\ngeneration of highly skilled, innovative and confident \r\nyoung people.\r\nAccording to the International Labour Organization, \r\nmore than 291 million people around the world are \r\nestimated to be unemployed this year. Creating job \r\nopportunities, especially for our young people, will \r\ntherefore be crucial to raising their standard of living. \r\nIn Brunei Darussalam, we are continuing our efforts \r\nto diversify our economy and advocate free trade \r\nbilaterally and regionally, with the aim of achieving a \r\ndynamic and sustainable economy.\r\nWhile pursuing economic progress, we should be \r\nmindful of the correlation between human activities \r\nand climate change. That is where the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change can galvanize our collective \r\nactions to bequeath a cleaner, healthier, safer and more \r\nsustainable planet to our future generations. Brunei \r\nDarussalam will continue to do what it can to contribute \r\npositively towards that end. To reduce greenhouse \r\ngas emissions, we are promoting efficiency in energy \r\nconsumption and gradually deploying renewable \r\nenergies. At the same time, conserving our forests is \r\na high priority, and that complements our multilateral \r\nefforts, including the Heart of Borneo initiative and, \r\nrecently, the Queen’s Commonwealth Canopy. All in \r\nall, it is about educating our people to care for and \r\nprotect our planet. And strengthening global efforts in \r\nthat area is also important.\r\nFor human and economic development to thrive, \r\nregional and international peace and security are \r\ncrucial. That is the basic foundation of the success of \r\nAssociation of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) as it \r\ncelebrates its fiftieth anniversary this year. So, for the \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n24/34 17-29728\r\ncontinued progress of South-East Asia and the region at \r\nlarge, it is the responsibility of all concerned to ensure \r\na stable, safe and secure environment, one that is free \r\nof conflict, war or the threat of war. We also strive for \r\nstronger engagement through confidence-building, \r\npreventive diplomacy and conflict resolution through \r\npeaceful means. It is through such efforts and close \r\ncooperation among ourselves and with our external \r\npartners that ASEAN hopes to further contribute to \r\nglobal peace and development.\r\nASEAN’s achievements over the past 50 years in \r\nensuring regional peace and security have enabled \r\nBrunei Darussalam to pursue its development objectives \r\nin a peaceful and harmonious environment. We are \r\npleased that our country has consistently achieved very \r\nhigh ranking in the Human Development Index of the \r\nUnited Nations Development Programme.\r\nAs the well-being of our people continues to be \r\ncentral to the nation, we are mindful of the negative \r\nimpact of security threats, particularly with regard to \r\nour work to ensure a sustainable world. Like many \r\nothers, we are concerned about the constant threats \r\nof terrorism and violent extremism. Sadly, in various \r\nparts of the world, the casualties resulting from \r\nterrorist attacks continue to shock us all. We condemn \r\nsuch horrendous acts and convey our deepest sympathy \r\nand condolences to the families of the victims. We wish \r\nto reiterate that terrorism should not be linked to any \r\nparticular race, religion, nationality or ethnicity.\r\nIn order to address those threats, it is important to \r\ncomprehensively examine the root causes of terrorism, \r\nsuch as poverty, marginalization and alienation, \r\nnotably among youth. It is our hope that focusing \r\non education and youth development, creating job \r\nopportunities, advocating the responsible use of social \r\nmedia and promoting dialogue among different faiths \r\nand civilizations will greatly help in our efforts to bring \r\nabout positive change.\r\nIt is equally important to instil in our people’s \r\nhearts and minds the values of peace, harmony, \r\nmoderation and mutual respect. It is through those \r\nvalues that we may be able to create societies that are \r\nresilient to destructive ideologies. Working closely with \r\nyouth, religious leaders and local communities will be \r\nessential to help to realize that. We therefore welcome \r\nall efforts of the international community to prevent \r\nand eradicate terrorism and violent extremism, in all \r\ntheir forms and manifestations.\r\nAlso of great concern are pandemic diseases and \r\nnatural disasters. On that note, I would like to join \r\nothers in expressing our condolences and sympathies \r\nto the families of the victims of the recent natural \r\ndisasters that have affected Mexico, Sierra Leone, the \r\nUnited States and countries in the Caribbean and South \r\nAsia. Given the destructive effects of natural disasters \r\non any country’s development and well-being, Brunei \r\nDarussalam values the work of all relevant agencies, \r\nincluding those of the United Nations, the World Health \r\nOrganization and ASEAN. They provide us with means \r\nto gain expertise and knowledge on how to deal with \r\nthe challenges posed by such threats.\r\nAs we seek to ensure that no one is left behind, \r\nwe should not forget the plight of those suffering from \r\nwar, conflict and occupation. Like everyone else, \r\nPalestinians have hopes and dreams of being educators, \r\ndoctors, engineers, artists, athletes and innovators, \r\nwhich are all for the good of humankind. However, for \r\nhalf a century, foreign occupation has prevented many \r\nof them from achieving their full human potential for \r\nmaking a greater contribution to global development. \r\nPeace, freedom, justice and self-determination are \r\nPalestinians’ fundamental rights. As the legitimate \r\nand truly representative Organization of the globe, \r\nthe United Nations has a moral and legal obligation \r\nto enforce those rights and ensure accountability for \r\nactions that contravene international law.\r\nWe continue to count on the United Nations, as \r\nwell as all relevant parties, to find comprehensive and \r\nlasting peace and stability in the region. We must press \r\non with all efforts to translate the growing international \r\nrecognition of the State of Palestine into positive \r\nchanges on the ground, so that Palestinians can pursue \r\nsustainable development in their own homeland.\r\nBrunei Darussalam looks to the United Nations \r\nto address pressing issues around the world. It is \r\nimportant for the United Nations to enhance its working \r\nrelationship with its network of partners, including \r\nregional organizations such as the Organization of \r\nIslamic Cooperation, the Commonwealth and ASEAN.\r\nIn order to better reflect the needs and realities of \r\nthe twenty-first century, the world needs a stronger, \r\nmore effective and more efficient United Nations. To \r\nthat end, we support our Secretary-General’s ideas \r\nfor reforming the United Nations and repositioning \r\nour Organization to focus more on measures for \r\npreventing conflicts, including mediation. We believe \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 25/34\r\nsuch endeavours will greatly help the United Nations \r\noptimize its work and resources and, above all, save \r\nlives, safeguard people’s dignity and promote peace \r\nand security around the world.\r\nWe want a United Nations that is fit for its purposes \r\nand principles, as enshrined in the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of all \r\nMember States to ensure that the United Nations truly \r\nlives up to its name. As we strive for a better future \r\ntogether, we hope for a successful United Nations. A \r\nsuccessful United Nations benefits humankind. When \r\nhumankind benefits, we all win.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nDato’ Sri Anifah Aman, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof Malaysia.\r\nMr. Aman (Malaysia): I congratulate Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on his election to the presidency of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session. I am \r\nconfident that under his able stewardship, the General \r\nAssembly — the main deliberative and policy-making \r\norgan of the United Nations — will see substantial \r\ndevelopment and advancement in addressing the many \r\nchallenges that our Organization faces today.\r\nI also congratulate His Excellency Mr. António \r\nGuterres on his appointment as the ninth Secretary-\r\nGeneral. I assure him that his endeavour to make \r\nthe United Nations an effective, relevant and \r\naugust Organization has Malaysia’s fullest support \r\nand cooperation.\r\nThe theme of the Assembly’s seventy-second \r\nsession, “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and \r\na decent life for all on a sustainable planet”, is most \r\nrelevant and timely as we work collectively and \r\nindividually to achieve all 17 Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) by 2030. That journey will not be easy. \r\nSome have even proposed that it should be the only \r\nfocus for the entire international community — to strive \r\ntowards ensuring our future survival in an inclusive \r\nmanner. We must strengthen our resolve and fulfil our \r\npromise to each and every citizen of the world that no \r\none will be left behind.\r\nOn that basis, Malaysia has always oriented its \r\ndevelopment agenda to accomplish that very promise. \r\nSustainable development has been at the heart of \r\nMalaysia’s development approach since the 1970s. In \r\n2009, the Malaysian Government launched its new \r\neconomic model, which features three new goals: \r\nhigh income, inclusivity and sustainability. Those \r\npursuits continue to resonate well with the three \r\ncomponents of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment — economic growth, social needs and \r\nenvironmental protection.\r\nWe have also adopted forward-looking development \r\npolicies through the Eleventh Malaysia Plan, which \r\nspans the five years from 2016 to 2020, under the theme \r\n“Anchoring growth on people”. That development plan \r\nreaffirms the Malaysian Government’s commitment to \r\na vision of growth anchored in the prosperity and well-\r\nbeing of its people, while protecting the environment \r\nand strengthening peace.\r\nIn July, Malaysia presented its voluntary national \r\nreview at the High-level Political Forum on SDGs. The \r\nreview, which reports the actions and measures taken by \r\nMalaysia to advance the implementation of the SDGs, \r\nis testimony to Malaysia’s continued commitment \r\nto achieving the 2030 Agenda. The Government \r\nof Malaysia strives to ensure that each and every \r\nMalaysian has an equitable share in the prosperity and \r\nwealth of the country and that no one is left behind.\r\nEarlier this week, Malaysia joined other Member \r\nStates in signing the Treaty on the Prohibition \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. We are convinced that the \r\npolitical and legal impact of the Treaty will steer the \r\ninternational community collectively towards the \r\nelimination of nuclear weapons and the maintenance \r\nof a world free of nuclear weapons. We were guided \r\nby the commitment of States to an instrument that is \r\nlegally sound and feasible to implement, one that sends \r\na powerful political message that nuclear weapons are \r\ncategorically unacceptable.\r\nMalaysia strongly believes in continuing to \r\nstrengthen and enhance legislative and collective \r\nenforcement capabilities in confronting international \r\nsecurity threats, particularly the proliferation of \r\nweapons of mass destruction and specifically to \r\nnon-State actors. We remain steadfastly committed \r\nto our international obligations in the fields of \r\ndisarmament and international security through various \r\nnational, regional and international approaches.\r\nIn that connection, Malaysia reiterates its strong \r\ncondemnation of the nuclear tests and missile launches \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, which \r\nseriously undermined the global disarmament and \r\nnon-proliferation regime. Malaysia calls on the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea to refrain from \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n26/34 17-29728\r\nconducting further nuclear tests and missile launches, \r\nto halt its nuclear and ballistic-missile programmes and \r\nto comply fully with its international obligations in \r\nthe interests of the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security. Malaysia joins other nations in stressing \r\nthe need for an immediate resumption of peaceful \r\ndialogue and negotiations among the relevant parties \r\nwith a view to finding a durable solution to the long-\r\nstanding conflict.\r\nWe are also seeing a convergence of new security \r\nthreats emerging from irregular migration and \r\ntransnational crime activities, which include terrorism, \r\ntrafficking in persons, illicit drug trafficking, money-\r\nlaundering and cybercrimes. The threats that we face \r\ntoday have an increasingly regional and international \r\nimpact, affecting our economies and lives in ways that \r\nwe have never experienced before. For that reason, \r\nMalaysia has made significant efforts to improve its \r\nlegislation and enforcement capabilities by adopting \r\na holistic approach to preventing and combating those \r\nheinous crimes.\r\nSadly, as we devote our attention to peace, a \r\ndecent life and a sustainable planet, there are people \r\nin the world who are suffering from horrifying crimes \r\nagainst humanity. In the past few weeks, we have seen \r\na recurrence of violence instigated by a delusional \r\nand desperate militant group of Rohingya in Rakhine \r\nstate. However, the subsequent clearance operations \r\nby Myanmar have claimed countless innocent civilian \r\nlives and caused more than 400,000 Rohingya to f lee \r\ntheir homes. The indiscriminate violence perpetrated \r\nagainst the Rohingya during those operations is of \r\ngrave concern to Malaysia and others. Such atrocities \r\nhave unleashed a full-scale humanitarian crisis that the \r\nworld simply cannot ignore and must be compelled to \r\nact on.\r\nIf the current situation is not addressed judiciously, \r\nthe desperate people of Rakhine state will become easy \r\nprey to recruitment by extremists, for which prolonged \r\nfrustration, anger and deprivation provide a fertile \r\nbreeding ground. Although the Myanmar Government \r\nhas given its repeated assurances that it will implement \r\nmeasures to resolve the issue, the recent incidents of \r\nviolence have not assuaged our concerns or assured us \r\nthat effective safeguards are being put in place on the \r\nground. I therefore call on the Government of Myanmar \r\nto end the violence, stop the destruction of life and \r\nproperty and allow immediate, unimpeded access for \r\nthe delivery of humanitarian aid.\r\nI would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncommend the Government of Bangladesh for all it \r\nhas done in receiving almost half a million Rohingya \r\nrefugees over the past three weeks. Sheltering such a \r\nhuge number of refugees puts a strain on any country. \r\nMalaysia dispatched humanitarian aid to Bangladesh \r\non 9 September and will do more. In the spirit of \r\ncompassion and humanity, I call on the international \r\ncommunity to support the humanitarian efforts \r\nin Bangladesh.\r\nOur collective failure to find a solution to the \r\nPalestinian question is totally unacceptable. The \r\nsituation in Palestine remains daunting and appalling \r\nas Israel continues to violate international law with its \r\nheavy-handed approach to the defenceless Palestinians. \r\nAs Israel’s occupation of Palestinian territory marks \r\nits fiftieth year, we must continue to intensify our \r\nefforts to find a just and durable solution to the \r\nPalestinian question.\r\nMalaysia reiterates that any action by Israel aimed \r\nat imposing its laws, jurisdiction and administration \r\non the holy city of Jerusalem is illegal and totally \r\nunacceptable. We remain extremely concerned about the \r\nlack of accountability for the Israeli occupying forces \r\nand the ongoing blockade of Gaza and the resulting \r\nhumanitarian crisis. We are extremely dismayed at the \r\ndiminishing prospect of peaceful coexistence as Israel’s \r\nillegal settlement activities continue unabated.\r\nThe implementation of Security Council resolution \r\n2334 (2016), adopted on 23 December 2016, remains a \r\nchallenge. In that regard, Malaysia reiterates its support \r\nfor the work of the Committee on the Exercise of the \r\nInalienable Rights of the Palestinian People and its \r\nproactive approach regarding the need for a written \r\nquarterly report by the Secretary-General on the \r\nresolution’s implementation. We urge the international \r\ncommunity, especially Member States, to continue \r\nto firmly support that vital call. If we continue to \r\nenable the resolution to be deliberately weakened in a \r\nshameless manner, rendering it unimplementable, we \r\nwill be guilty of deconstructing any two-State solution.\r\nMalaysia will continue to support the work of the \r\nUnited Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East. The plight of some 5 million \r\nregistered Palestine refugees must not be ignored. In \r\nview of the Agency’s weakening financial situation, \r\nwe urge the international community to strengthen its \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 27/34\r\ncommitment to providing it with financial and other \r\nrelevant assistance.\r\nIn our fight against the scourge of violent \r\nextremism, Malaysia would like to reiterate the ongoing \r\nurgency of taking a moderate approach to countering \r\nthe propagation of extremism and radicalization. \r\nTo that end, Malaysia reiterates the call for a global \r\nmovement of moderates that Prime Minister Najib \r\nRazak made in 2010, with the aim of dousing the \r\nf lames of hatred and halting the influence of extreme \r\nand myopic ideas of intolerance, xenophobia and racial \r\nhatred, among others.\r\nIt is imperative that communities of different \r\nraces, religions and cultures band together in seeking \r\ncommon peaceful aspirations and celebrating their \r\ndiversity, rather than being influenced by and enticed \r\ninto extremist traps. Malaysia therefore looks forward \r\nto bringing the initiative for a global movement of \r\nmoderates to the United Nations through a draft \r\nresolution at this session. It is imperative that the voices \r\nof reason, tolerance and understanding drown out those \r\nthat glorify the extremism that sows seeds of hatred \r\namong our communities.\r\nIf it is to carry out its arduous tasks, the United \r\nNations cannot afford to stand still and remain idle. \r\nSince taking over the helm of the Organization, the \r\nSecretary-General, together with the Secretariat, has \r\ninitiated various efforts to make it more efficient, \r\neffective, agile and fit for purpose. Malaysia commends \r\nthe dynamic leadership of the Secretary-General \r\nthrough his various reform initiatives, which include \r\nreviewing the peace and security architecture and \r\nenhancing the overall development system and United \r\nNations management reform, among others.\r\nMalaysia is of the view that any major reform \r\ninitiative that might include cost-cutting measures \r\nshould not hamper or disrupt the Organization’s existing \r\ndevelopment efforts to achieve peace and a decent \r\nlife for all. That includes peacekeeping operations, \r\npeacebuilding, and development programmes in \r\ndeveloping countries, especially in countries in areas \r\nof conflict. I wish to express my delegation’s full \r\ncooperation, support and commitment to working \r\nclosely with the Secretary-General, all Member States \r\nand various stakeholders towards implementing the \r\nreform initiatives.\r\nLet us strengthen our resolve in fulfilling our \r\ncollective responsibilities. i assure the Assembly of \r\nMalaysia’s continued support and commitment to \r\nthe agenda of the United Nations and the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Samura M.W. Kamara, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nand International Cooperation of the Republic of \r\nSierra Leone.\r\nMr. Kamara (Sierra Leone): I bring the Assembly \r\nfraternal greetings and very best wishes from His \r\nExcellency Mr. Ernest Bai Koroma, President of the \r\nRepublic of Sierra Leone. President Koroma deeply \r\nregrets that he is unable to participate in the seventy-\r\nsecond session of the General Assembly, due to \r\nunavoidable circumstances. He has, however, instructed \r\nme to deliver the following message.\r\n“I congratulate the President on his assumption \r\nof the responsibility for directing the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session. I \r\nwould like to assure him of my personal support \r\nand that of my country throughout his tenure. Let \r\nme also congratulate and warmly welcome our \r\nnew Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres. I \r\ncommend and thank their predecessors, Mr. Peter \r\nThomson and Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for their leadership \r\nand outstanding commitment to advancing our \r\ncollective aspirations and energy, maintaining \r\nglobal peace and security and achieving sustainable \r\ndevelopment for all, as well as for their concern \r\nregarding climate change.\r\n“In March of 2018, the people of Sierra Leone \r\nwill go to the polls to elect their new leaders in \r\nlocal Government, parliamentary and judicial \r\nelections. A few months from now, my second \r\nterm in office will come to an end, and I will be \r\ngraciously handing over power to Sierra Leone’s \r\nnext democratically elected President. We have \r\nhad 10 years of working together, 10 years of \r\nbuilding and consolidating peace and democracy, \r\nof enjoying the atmosphere of a peaceful transfer \r\nof power, political party pluralism, a vibrant civil \r\nsociety and a critical media landscape. We are not \r\nyet where we want to be as a country, but with the \r\nsustained support of the international community, \r\nSierra Leone is not where it was 10 years ago.\r\n“Today, a country that was once regarded as a \r\nfragile State is ranked the most peaceful in West \r\nAfrica and about the fourth most peaceful in Africa. \r\nWe have raised our economy to become one of the \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n28/34 17-29728\r\nfastest growing in Africa. Even when we were \r\nhalted and derailed by the Ebola virus outbreak, \r\nwith the international community’s support, we \r\nfought hard, and once again we are registering a \r\npositive economic outlook.\r\n“As I look back on those 10 years, as I look back \r\non that long and challenging path we have travelled \r\ntogether, as I prepare to step aside, I do so with a \r\nsense of pride, a sense of fulfilment and a sense \r\nof satisfaction that we have played our parts in the \r\nrebuilding of our nation, in transforming lives and \r\nin giving hope to millions of people.\r\n“Let me particularly commend the United \r\nNations for its significant contribution to \r\nrestoring peace, security, stability and economic \r\nreconstruction in my country. I am happy to note \r\nthat today Sierra Leone is described by the United \r\nNations, through the Peacebuilding Commission, \r\nas a proud storehouse of lessons for a seamless \r\ntransition from war to peace, democracy and \r\nstability. Those lessons have provided us with \r\nvaluable and cost-effective tools for the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and conflict prevention.\r\n“We have always been more than ready and \r\nwilling to share those lessons with other countries \r\nin a similar plight, especially countries within \r\nour small g7+ group of post-conflict countries, \r\nwhich are striving to leave fragility behind and \r\npromote resilience. We have already held three \r\nhighly successful and widely acclaimed peaceful, \r\nfree and fair democratic elections following the \r\nend of the civil conflicts. Those are milestones \r\nthat significantly demonstrate our exemplary \r\nperformance in the consolidation of peace and \r\nsecurity. The elections to be held will be no different \r\nin terms of transparency, fairness or credibility.\r\n“The choice of the theme for this session, \r\n‘Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet’, is apt and timely \r\nin an era of global uncertainties and challenges, \r\nincluding the emergence of new threats that tend to \r\nundermine our efforts in the promotion of economic \r\nand social advancement of all peoples. For 72 years, \r\nthrough this Organization, we have combined our \r\nefforts to prevent a major war and to promote \r\nhuman rights, fundamental freedoms, justice and \r\nequal rights for men and women of all races. Yet \r\nwe are faced with unprecedented global challenges \r\nof enormous proportions. The seemingly unending \r\ncycles of conflict and violence, the destructive and \r\ndevastating impacts of climate change, the spread \r\nof terrorism and the largest refugee, migration and \r\nhumanitarian crises in recent history continue to \r\ncall into question the effectiveness of our present \r\ninternational machinery, as well as our ability to \r\npromote sustainable peace and a decent life for all.\r\n“We should therefore generate innovative \r\nideas and credible mechanisms that will bring all \r\nconflicts to a peaceful end. We should promote \r\nsocial progress, peace and security, human rights \r\nand fundamental freedoms. We must secure \r\nbetter standards of life for humankind. We must \r\nremain steadfast in our commitment to building \r\na sustainable planet for present and succeeding \r\ngenerations. This Assembly should, in that regard, \r\nreflect on reforms that will reinforce our collective \r\nobligation to upholding the purposes and principles \r\non which our Organization was founded.\r\n“The General Assembly has consistently \r\nreaffirmed our collective commitment to \r\nstrengthening the role of mediation in the peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes and in conflict prevention \r\nand resolution. It is a valuable and cost-effective \r\ntool. It is Sierra Leone’s firm belief that we \r\nmust continue to build on the gains made in our \r\npreventive diplomacy efforts, including heightened \r\ncollaboration with each other and among our \r\nregional organizations and actors, making use of \r\nexperiences that have helped us achieve relative \r\ninternational peace and security.\r\n“In that regard, I am heartened by the powerful \r\nimpetus of the preferential use of preventive \r\ndiplomacy and mediation efforts in the maintenance \r\nof international peace and security by the United \r\nNations system. The good offices of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral, including the early-warning system and \r\nthe international contact groups, are important \r\ninstruments in preventing conflicts and must be \r\nfurther strengthened to effectively respond to any \r\ncrisis situation. The effective utilization of Chapter \r\nVI of the Charter therefore remains the best option \r\nfor the Organization in the prevention and peaceful \r\nsettlement of disputes.\r\n“Obviously, mediation remains a powerful \r\ninstrument for the prevention and settlement of armed \r\nconflicts and must be utilized to the fullest extent \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 29/34\r\npossible. My country has indeed benefited from \r\nmediation efforts under the auspices of the United \r\nNations and the Economic Community of West \r\nAfrican States. We have learned from experience \r\nthat for mediation efforts to be fruitful, they must \r\nembrace such measures as the timely cessation of \r\nhostilities, credible ceasefire agreements and the \r\ntimely deployment of peacekeeping and observer \r\nmissions to be able to undertake and supervise the \r\ndisarmament, demobilization and reintegration of \r\nex-combatants and displaced persons.\r\n“Furthermore, the role of regional organizations \r\nin partnership with the United Nations must be \r\nfurther strengthened to ensure a greater response \r\nat the regional level in implementing preventive \r\nmeasures such as early-warning mechanisms. \r\nRegional organizations are usually better positioned \r\nto generate the necessary political will for conflict \r\nprevention within their regions.\r\n“The role of the Peacebuilding Commission has \r\nbeen exemplary, and its experience, expertise and \r\nknowledge in preventing conflicts from escalating \r\ninto violence or war, as well as in supporting post-\r\nconflict endeavours, should be tapped into. In that \r\nregard, we encourage the sharing of the experiences \r\ngained and lessons learned through the engagement \r\nof the Peacebuilding Commission.\r\n“As I have already stated, since I assumed the \r\nleadership of Sierra Leone almost 10 years ago, \r\nthe country continues to make steady progress, \r\nparticularly in the priority sectors of infrastructure, \r\nhuman development, agriculture and food security, \r\ndemocracy, international relations, justice, human \r\nrights and inclusive governance, as outlined in my \r\nmedium-term development plan, the Agenda for \r\nChange, followed by the Agenda for Prosperity. \r\nThose transformative strategies have gone a long \r\nway to more visibly repairing and healing the \r\ndamage and scars resulting from a brutal war, \r\nwhile also charting a path for achieving sustainable \r\nsocioeconomic development and shared prosperity \r\nand, more particularly, for transforming Sierra \r\nLeone into a middle-income country by the \r\nyear 2025.\r\n“Three years ago, in 2014, the unexpected \r\nand unprecedented outbreak of the Ebola virus \r\nsubstantially wiped out the social and economic \r\nfabric and the gains that Sierra Leone had \r\npainstakingly achieved over 10 years of progressive \r\npost-conflict reconstruction efforts. Shortly after \r\nbeing recognized as one of the countries with the \r\nhighest growth rate in the world, our economy \r\nplunged very sharply, from record high gross \r\ndomestic product growth rates of 15.2 per cent \r\nand 20.1 per cent, in 2012 and 2013, respectively, \r\nto record low rates of 4.6 per cent and -21.7 per \r\ncent, in 2014 and 2015, respectively. The epidemic \r\nrevealed fundamental systemic weaknesses that \r\nstill remained to be addressed in post-conflict \r\nSierra Leone, especially in the health-care \r\nsystem. The fight to end, eradicate and prevent \r\nthe recurrence of the Ebola virus was largely won \r\nthrough strong leadership, community ownership \r\nand national resilience.\r\n“While we were on the verge of turning the \r\ncorner in our post-Ebola recovery strides, Sierra \r\nLeone was severely hit by torrential rainfall in \r\nthe early hours of 14 August, leading to f lash \r\nf looding in several areas of the capital city, as well \r\nas the collapse of the hillside of Mount Sugarloaf, \r\noverlooking Freetown and its environs, causing \r\nwidespread devastation. The impact has been \r\npenetrating and far-reaching, especially for women \r\nand children, who were most affected. More than \r\n500 lives were lost, several people were severely \r\ninjured and traumatized, more than 600 remain \r\nmissing, around 7,000 were rendered homeless and \r\nphysical property and assets worth an estimated \r\n$30 million were lost.\r\n“This year’s rainfall is the third in a series of \r\nheavy torrential rains with devastating impact, \r\nmostly on vulnerable groups in our cities. Such rains \r\ndisplace hundreds of people, destroy farmland, \r\nbusinesses and properties and cost lives.\r\n“While I once again take this opportunity to \r\nthank the international community for its support \r\nduring these moments of grief and need, let me \r\nstate that such disasters are a stark reminder that \r\nclimate change is real. They also demonstrate the \r\nlevel of Sierra Leone’s vulnerability to climate \r\nchange. I therefore reiterate Sierra Leone’s support \r\nfor the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and \r\nurge concerted global efforts in dealing with this \r\nimmediate, real threat to humankind.\r\n“Under my leadership, Sierra Leone has \r\nenhanced political stability by strengthening \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n30/34 17-29728\r\ninstitutions and laying a basis for good governance \r\nby allowing those institutions sufficient leverage \r\nand latitude to deliver on their respective \r\nstatutory mandates. My Government has recorded \r\nsignificant milestones in the areas of gender \r\nequality and women’s empowerment, as well as in \r\npromoting youth employment and empowerment. \r\nWe have established a more stable and regulatory \r\nenvironment for investment and wealth generation, \r\nwhich in the medium- and long-term will create \r\nemployment opportunities for the inclusive \r\nsocioeconomic development of young people, the \r\ndisabled and women.\r\n“My Government’s programmes for local \r\nGovernment and decentralization have provided \r\ngreater space for wider and deeper community \r\nparticipation in our development trajectory. \r\nFurthermore, the launch of the Open Government \r\ninitiative in 2008, followed by our membership \r\nof the Open Government Partnership in 2014, \r\nhas together created an effective platform for \r\ntransparent governance and citizens’ empowerment, \r\nthereby building trust and confidence between \r\nmy Government and the people. With those \r\ndevelopments, Sierra Leone is now on a solid path \r\nand will continue to consolidate its transition from \r\nwar to peace and shore up democratic credentials, \r\ninclusive growth and a decent life for all.\r\n“Learning from the Ebola virus outbreak, my \r\nGovernment has responded to the task of building a \r\nresilient health system to prevent, detect and respond \r\nto any public health threats of similar nature. \r\nWe have established public-health laboratories \r\nnationwide that have full capabilities to test for viral \r\nhemorrhagic fevers, including Ebola. The f loods \r\nand mudslides are pointing us to a greater emphasis \r\non the environment, particularly regarding land \r\nmanagement, reforestation, affordable housing, \r\nurbanization and upgrading slums.\r\n“While we remain determined to accelerate the \r\npositive transformation of Sierra Leone, ensuring \r\nthat Sierra Leoneans benefit from the dividends \r\nof our well-earned peace and democracy, we \r\nlook forward to more strategic engagement with \r\nour partners in effectively implementing the \r\nSustainable Development Goals in Sierra Leone, \r\nespecially in diversifying our economy, with \r\na focus on agriculture, fisheries, tourism and \r\nmanufacturing industries, as well as on investment \r\nin education and health. Evidence abounds that \r\nin those resource-full sectors there is enormous \r\neconomic potential for public-private sector \r\npartnerships and for North-South, South-South and \r\ntriangular cooperation. We urge our partners to \r\njoin with us in tapping those potentials.\r\n“As coordinator of the African Union \r\nCommittee of Ten Heads of State and Government \r\non the United Nations Security Council Reforms, \r\nI would like to end my remarks by reiterating \r\nAfrica’s concern about the slow pace of the reform \r\nprocess. We have heard that concern expressed \r\nby the current Chair of the African Union, His \r\nExcellency Professor Alpha Condé, President of \r\nthe Republic of Guinea, as well as by several other \r\nHeads of State and Heads of Government.\r\n“Beyond the compelling urge to correct \r\nthe historical injustice done to Africa, we must \r\nthoroughly reflect on the current geopolitical \r\nrealities that generally compel the reform and \r\nmodernization of the United Nations system, \r\nparticularly the Security Council. We must also \r\nreflect on the continent’s numerical strength, its \r\ngrowing economic power, its population dynamics \r\nand its increasing role in the multilateral system. \r\nAgainst that background, Africa’s demand, as \r\narticulated in the Ezulwini Consensus and the Sirte \r\nDeclaration, is therefore even more legitimate and \r\nought to be redressed and treated on the basis of \r\nequity in the global governance system.\r\n“As we look at the work that lies ahead, let us \r\nnot lose sight of our shared obligation to ensure \r\na peaceful and secure world by resolving our \r\ndifferences, including national and international \r\ndisputes, through constructive dialogue. We must \r\nrespect and prioritize strengthening the existing \r\nmediation mechanisms provided in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations. I am convinced that the pace of \r\nglobal development and the achievement of peace \r\nand security will significantly accelerate if we \r\nappreciate the wisdom of redirecting resources from \r\nthe current nuclear arms race to people-centred \r\ndevelopment. That will benefit humankind more \r\nthan a continuation of the ruinous competition for \r\nsuperiority. It will also facilitate the attainment \r\nof our desired twin goals of sustainable peace \r\nand development.\r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 31/34\r\n“As I graciously bow out as President of my \r\nbeloved country, I will be leaving office with the \r\nsincere hope that the successful implementation \r\nof the priorities and programmes that I have laid \r\nout will enhance Sierra Leone’s attainment of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals. I also hope that \r\nthe international community will continue to stand \r\nby the great and resilient people of Sierra Leone in \r\nthe pursuit of our collective aspiration to become a \r\nmiddle-income country. It is my fervent hope that \r\nthe current momentum and development trajectory, \r\nwhich are defined by transformative strategies \r\nand catalytic actions, will be maintained through \r\na sustained United Nations partnership with my \r\nsuccessor. I therefore thank all of our development \r\npartners, both at the bilateral and multilateral \r\nlevels, who have collaborated with us to support the \r\nstrides that we have achieved during my tenure.”\r\nThe Acting President: Before giving the f loor to \r\nspeakers in exercise of the right of reply, may I remind \r\nmembers that statements in the exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first intervention \r\nand 5 minutes for the second, and should be made by \r\ndelegations from their seats.\r\nMs. Ivanović (Serbia): My delegation would like to \r\nexercise its right of reply in response to the statement \r\ndelivered by the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nAlbania (see A/72/PV.15).\r\nAt this seventy-second session of the General \r\nAssembly, as Member States work to address and \r\nfind solutions to the numerous challenges that the \r\ninternational community faces, let me underline that \r\nthe consolidation of international peace, security and \r\nstability continues to be a priority for the Republic of \r\nSerbia as well. To achieve those goals, my country has \r\ninvested the greatest possible effort in strengthening \r\nregional cooperation, stabilization and reconciliation, \r\nfor which it has been widely recognized and acclaimed. \r\nWe therefor fully share the approach and vision of the \r\nWestern Balkans working together.\r\nDuring the general debate at this session, numerous \r\ndignitaries have underlined the importance of respecting \r\nthe sovereignty and territorial integrity of all Member \r\nStates. However, the Prime Minister of the Republic of \r\nAlbania again used the Assembly to call on Member States \r\nto recognize the independence of the Serbian southern \r\nprovince, the so-called independent State of Kosovo, \r\ncontrary to Security Council resolution 1244 (1999), \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations and the principles \r\non which the Organization is based. Unfortunately, the \r\nPrime Minister of Albania also misled Member States \r\nthrough his contention that dialogue is being conducted \r\nbetween two States — Serbia and Kosovo — and not, \r\nas is the real situation, between Belgrade and Pristina, \r\nthat is, the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government \r\nin the province.\r\nLet me recall that all outstanding issues within \r\nthe process of the normalization of relations between \r\nBelgrade and Pristina are being addressed within the \r\ndialogue conducted in Brussels, with the facilitation \r\nof the European Union. Any unilateral act during the \r\ncourse of the dialogue will only undermine the process. \r\nNeedless to say, interventions like those made by \r\nthe Prime Minister of Albania today may jeopardize \r\npositive results of the dialogue and set back its progress \r\nin the future.\r\nIn conclusion, let me point out that settling the \r\nstatus of Serbia’s southern province is among my \r\nGovernment’s top priorities. We have demonstrated, \r\ntime and again, our readiness to make an active \r\ncontribution in the efforts to reach solutions that would \r\nbe acceptable to all, taking into account the legitimate \r\ninterests of all communities in Kosovo and Metohija.\r\nKosovo is not an independent State and is not a \r\nMember of the United Nations. Let me be clear and \r\nstress once again that Serbia will continue to use all \r\ndiplomatic means to preserve its sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity.\r\nMr. Al-Kuwari (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): My \r\ndelegation rejects all the allegations and false claims \r\nabout my country, the State of Qatar, that we heard \r\nearlier in the statement by the representative of the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates. Qatar is dealing with an illegal \r\nand unjust siege that violates its sovereignty and \r\nnational decision-making ability.\r\nWhat we heard today in the Emirates statement is a \r\ncontinuation of the false claims and allegations started \r\nby the countries that are party to the siege, including the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates, in an attempt to defame the State \r\nof Qatar and damage its foreign policy and its relations \r\nwith friendly countries. The siege began with acts of \r\nair and sea piracy and has included electronic crimes \r\nsuch as the hacking of the Qatar news agency. Those \r\nallegations and false claims, which have been going \r\non for three months, have been accompanied by a full-\r\nf ledged siege that violates all the forms of cooperation \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n32/34 17-29728\r\non which this Organization was established. They \r\nviolate the Charter of the United Nations, human \r\nrights and a people’s right to self-determination. They \r\nviolate good relations among States and humanitarian \r\nprinciples. They also violate the charter of the Gulf \r\nCooperation Council.\r\nMany countries have objected to the siege and \r\ncalled for it to be lifted. Many have spoken about its \r\nnegative effects. We have been able to deal with those \r\nunjust measures through the unity of our people, \r\nour standing in the world and the solidarity that \r\ncountries around the world have expressed so that we \r\ncan confront the challenges together. We believe that \r\nthese illegal measures impede United Nations efforts \r\nto enhance cooperation among countries in facing our \r\ncommon challenges.\r\nDespite the many attempts to defame the State of \r\nQatar, we know that the international community is \r\naware of the aims of this campaign, and especially that \r\nthe countries participating in the siege have failed to \r\nprove why they imposed it. They know that their claims \r\nare intended only to punish the State of Qatar because \r\nwe are fighting for human rights, freedom of speech and \r\nthe peaceful resolution of conflicts. They are trying to \r\nforce the State of Qatar to change its position.\r\nQatar’s record in combating terrorism is known to \r\nall in the United Nations and to our partners in this \r\nfight. It is better than the record of those who are \r\nstating anything to the contrary, and is illustrated by \r\nour participation in the international alliance against \r\nterrorism and in other regional and international \r\nefforts to that end. The State of Qatar is also working \r\nthrough bilateral mechanisms to enhance regional \r\nand international cooperation on fighting terrorism \r\nand cutting off its sources of funding. We have \r\nimplemented our international obligations pursuant to \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions with regard to \r\ncountering terrorism and ending its funding, whether by \r\nfreezing assets, preventing subjects from travelling, or \r\nimplementing other measures adopted by the Security \r\nCouncil. The State of Qatar will always be firm when \r\nit comes to implementing Security Council resolutions \r\nagainst terrorism.\r\nIn conclusion, we want to state that we are all \r\ncollectively responsible for respecting the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter with regard to the sovereignty \r\nof countries, non-interference in countries’ affairs and \r\nrespecting human rights. We believe that the General \r\nAssembly is the most representative forum in the world \r\nand the best for defending the Charter and human rights \r\nand international law. Instead of accusing Qatar, the \r\nEmirates should end all its violations of the Security \r\nCouncil’s resolutions on Libya. It should stop creating \r\nchaos, launching conflicts and pretending to fight \r\nterrorism in order to serve its own interests, knowing \r\nthat that is leading to more terrorism as a result of their \r\nfailed policies. We call on the international community \r\nto condemn those measures.\r\nMr. Idrizi (Albania): My delegation is taking the \r\nf loor in response to the statement just made by the \r\nrepresentative of Serbia in reaction to the statement \r\nof the Prime Minister of Albania, His Excellency \r\nMr. Edi Rama, this morning in the general debate (see \r\nA/72/PV.15). I wish I were not obliged to take the f loor \r\nat this late hour, but I deem it important to say a few \r\nwords to set the record straight.\r\nThe representative of Serbia questioned the call of \r\nthe Prime Minister of Albania addressed to those United \r\nNations Members that have not yet recognized Kosovo. \r\nLet me recall that Kosovo has been an independent \r\nState since 2008 and to date has been recognized by \r\n114 Member States. In the course of almost a decade, \r\nKosovo has established and strengthened its worldwide \r\ngeopolitical identity and has proved itself to be a \r\nvaluable contributor to peace, stability and cooperation \r\nin the region. Nowadays, Kosovo is a member and active \r\nparticipant in all regional initiatives in South-East \r\nEurope. It has signed a Stabilization and Association \r\nAgreement with the European Union and, like all other \r\ncountries in the region, is working towards future \r\nEuropean Union membership.\r\nInternational recognition and the full participation \r\nof Kosovo in all regional bodies have brought clear \r\nbenefits. They have improved the overall political \r\natmosphere in the region, facilitated trade and economic \r\nrelations and improved the mobility of people, and \r\nyoung people in particular. We remain convinced that, \r\nbased on that record, the United Nations and other \r\ninternational organizations would only benefit by the \r\npresence and contribution of Kosovo. That is why we \r\nfirmly believe, as Prime Minister Rama stated this \r\nmorning, that\r\n“recognizing Kosovo ... and helping Kosovo move \r\nforward ... [is] a direct contribution to bettering \r\nthe lives of Kosovo’s citizens and investing in the \r\n22/09/2017 A/72/PV.18\r\n17-29728 33/34\r\nsecurity and stability of the whole region and of all \r\nits countries, including Serbia” (A/72/PV.15, p. 20).\r\nFor several years, Kosovo and Serbia have been \r\nengaged in a dialogue, facilitated by the European \r\nUnion and conducted at the highest levels. That has \r\nbrought the two countries together in the quest for \r\ncommon solutions to a series of important issues for \r\nthe good of their citizens. We support that dialogue \r\nand encourage both countries to continue to work \r\ntowards full normalization of their relations as the \r\nbest investment for them, one offering real prospects \r\ntowards reconciliation. That is what both Kosovo and \r\nSerbia need. That is what the whole Western Balkans \r\nmust achieve in order to build its present and design \r\ntheir future — a future in peace, a future in Europe.\r\nMr. Al Musharakh (United Arab Emirates) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): We regret the fact that the representative \r\nof the State of Qatar has once again sought to distract \r\nall of those gathered here from the international \r\ncommitments that his country should be upholding. \r\nFour countries have taken entirely legitimate measures \r\nagainst the State of Qatar, which claims to be combating \r\nterrorism, but in point of fact those States’ decisions \r\ntaken in their genuine efforts to fight terrorism are \r\nentirely acceptable under international law and duly \r\ntake into account the serious violations committed by \r\nthe Qatar, which finances terrorist organizations.\r\nOur decision to break off relations with Qatar was \r\nnot a difficult one. Our decision to sever diplomatic \r\nties and relations was a direct response to Qatar’s own \r\nactions, which have destabilized the region. Qatar \r\nmeddles in the internal affairs of other Arab States, \r\nsupports radicalism and fosters extremism in many \r\ncountries in the Middle East. In point of fact, the State \r\nof Qatar is regularly violates international law and the \r\ndecisions and resolutions of the Security Council. We \r\nshall therefore continue, on the basis of the decisions \r\nthat we have already taken, to enact the measures that \r\nwe have put in place because we have found no other \r\nway to protect ourselves from Qatar’s hostile actions.\r\nQatar has a clear choice. It can either choose to \r\nremain a rogue State that does not respect international \r\nlaw or it can choose to be a State that abides by its \r\nobligations to the international community. It cannot \r\nwear both hats at the same time.\r\nMr. Elshenawy (Egypt) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to exercise our right of reply in response to the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the State \r\nof Qatar.\r\nWe do not find it odd that the delegation of the \r\nState of Qatar is making allegations in order to defend \r\nits position after Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab \r\nEmirates and Bahrain became fed up with the situation \r\nand decided to enact legal measures, such as those taken \r\nrecently, to prevent the Qatari regime from supporting \r\nterrorism and interfering in the internal affairs of \r\nother countries.\r\nAs we all know, the Qatari regime supports \r\nterrorism in Syria, Iraq, Libya and elsewhere. It has \r\nrecently financed terrorism in Iraq, for example, \r\nby paying ransom to terrorists. The regime is also \r\nproviding terrorists with weapons, safe havens \r\nand even with Qatari nationality, and it declines to \r\nprosecute or extradite them as it is required to do under \r\nCouncil resolutions. It is also very openly instigating \r\nterrorist acts. Qatar’s support of terrorism, which it has \r\nmaintained for years, has been specifically mentioned \r\nin reports of Security Council sanctions committees, \r\nand is known to all.\r\nWe all reject the regime’s insistence on supporting \r\nterrorism. Its continued refusal to get back on the right \r\ntrack is the reason that our four countries decided to \r\ntake measures in accordance with international law. \r\nWe remind everyone, particularly the terror-supporting \r\nQatari regime, that fighting and countering terrorism \r\nis a commitment and an obligation for all countries, in \r\nline with the relevant Council resolutions. The Qatari \r\nregime rejects that notion because it supports terrorism.\r\nMr. Al-Kuwari (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): It is \r\ntruly regrettable that the delegation of the United Arab \r\nEmirates has once again verbally attacked Qatar. That \r\ncomes as no surprise in the light of the results of the \r\ninvestigation conducted by the Qatari authorities and \r\ninternational agencies into the hacking of the Qatari \r\nnews agency a few months ago, revealing that the \r\nhacking was carried out by a nearby Gulf State. That \r\ncrime was accompanied by a campaign of lies and \r\ndefamation targeting Qatar. The lies included in the \r\nstatement made by the representative of the United Arab \r\nEmirates represent a continuation of that campaign, \r\nwhich everyone knows is fabricated.\r\nWe affirm that any allegations of a link between \r\nQatar and terrorism are false and baseless. Those who \r\nstand behind that campaign have tried to falsely accuse \r\nQatar of terrorism because of the impact of the use \r\nA/72/PV.18 22/09/2017\r\n34/34 17-29728\r\nof that term. Those abominable attempts have failed \r\nbecause the international community refuses to use the \r\naccusation of terrorism as a way to single out and berate \r\ncountries and give them a bad name, thus excluding \r\nthem from international efforts.\r\nQatar has made efforts that are supported and \r\ncommended by many. It is therefore truly ironic that \r\nthe United Arab Emirates can speak about combating \r\nterrorism while some of its citizens have participated \r\nin some of the most heinous terrorist attacks in history, \r\nwhile its regime reaps huge financial benefits from \r\nterrorism and continues to defy international sanctions.\r\nThe meeting rose at 9.40 p.m.\r\n"
