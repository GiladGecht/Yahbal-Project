"United Nations A/72/PV.19\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n19th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 23 September 2017, 9 a.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 9 a.m.\r\nAddress by Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President \r\nof the Democratic Republic of the Congo\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the President of the Democratic Republic of \r\nthe Congo.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\ninto the General Assembly Hall.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI have the honour to welcome to the United Nations His \r\nExcellency Mr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of \r\nthe Democratic Republic of the Congo, and to invite \r\nhim to address the Assembly.\r\nPresident Kabila Kabange (spoke in French): I \r\nwish to express my very warm congratulations, Sir, on \r\nyour election as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session, which is an acknowledgement \r\nof your distinguished career as a diplomat and a tribute \r\nto your country, Slovakia. I would also like to pay \r\ntribute to Secretary-General António Guterres for his \r\nleadership and efforts to strengthen the role of our \r\nOrganization during this first year of his term of office.\r\nThe theme of this session — “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet” — responds to the concerns \r\nof the moment in most of the States Members of the \r\nOrganization. I am pleased with it, as it is consistent \r\nwith the logic of the Sustainable Development Goals \r\nand because, for my country, peace, stability and the \r\nimprovement of our people’s living conditions are the \r\nGovernment’s priorities.\r\nSeventy-two years ago the Organization was born \r\nout of the ambition to reform relations among States on \r\nthe basis of the principle of sovereign equality and the \r\ndesire to guarantee peace and prosperity for all. That \r\nambition remains relevant and is carried forward every \r\nday by the commitment of women and men who are \r\ndetermined to see it fulfilled, sometimes at the risk of \r\ntheir lives.\r\nIn the face of the rise of terrorism in various forms, it \r\nis indisputable that the world to which we aspire depends \r\non how we address peace and security issues. For the \r\npast year, my country has been the victim of terrorist \r\nattacks, especially in the Kasai provinces and even in \r\nthe capital, by certain armed groups whose objective is \r\nto destroy the peace so dearly acquired, so as to thwart \r\nthe dynamics of consensus-based problem-solving at \r\nthe national level and to undermine our development \r\nefforts. In the Kasai, a mystico-tribal militia is using \r\nthe civilian population, including children, as human \r\nshields and is attacking people and public buildings that \r\nsymbolize the authority of the State. It is thereby sowing \r\nterror — decapitating law-enforcement officers, agents \r\nof the Independent National Electoral Commission, and \r\nadministrative and traditional authorities.\r\nThose were the circumstances of deplorable \r\nbarbarity in which the two United Nations experts \r\nlost their lives in March. We are determined to make \r\nsure that light is shed on the exact circumstances of \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages. Corrections should be submitted to the original languages only. \r\nThey should be incorporated in a copy of the record and sent under the signature of a member \r\nof the delegation concerned to the Chief of the Verbatim Reporting Service, room U-0506 \r\n(verbatimrecords@un.org). Corrected records will be reissued electronically on the Official \r\nDocument System of the United Nations (http://documents.un.org).\r\n17-29801 (E)\r\n*1729801*\r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n2/25 17-29801\r\nthat crime so that that horrible act, as well as those to \r\nwhich our countrymen have been subjected, will not \r\ngo unpunished. That is why public trials were begun \r\nseveral weeks ago, following the arrest of most of those \r\npresumed to be guilty. That was also the purpose of \r\nthe recent conference on peace, reconciliation and \r\ndevelopment, which aimed to establish the truth of \r\nwhat really happened in those central provinces of the \r\ncountry, to promote reconciliation among the people \r\nof those provinces and to affirm our belief that all \r\nreconciliation necessarily involves justice and that \r\nthere can be no real and lasting peace without justice.\r\nMy country remains open to all forms of \r\ncollaboration on that subject. Thanks to that approach, \r\nwhich combines the restoration of State authority, \r\ndialogue and restorative justice, we have been able to \r\nreverse the dangerous trend in the security situation \r\nin the centre of the country, which has improved \r\nvery significantly.\r\nIn the eastern part of the country, laudable efforts \r\nby the national defence and security forces have in turn \r\nallowed us to contain the terrorist attacks of the Allied \r\nDemocratic Forces, which plagued our populations \r\ndaily. We are convinced that the subregional cooperation \r\ninitiative involving my country, South Sudan and the \r\nCentral African Republic will also allow us to halt the \r\nterrorist threat posed by the Lord’s Resistance Army. \r\nOur participation in the process should be seen as \r\nevidence of our determination in the coalition’s fight \r\nagainst that threat.\r\nWith regard to combating sexual violence, I welcome \r\nthe outstanding progress recorded by the courts, which \r\nhave handed down hundreds of convictions for rape. No \r\none has been spared from prosecution because of social \r\nposition or military rank, which is proof that impunity \r\nin that area has ended.\r\nTwo years after the adoption of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, it is not too early to \r\nbegin monitoring its implementation. In carrying out \r\nits commitments, my country has begun the process \r\nof prioritizing the environmental, social and economic \r\ndimensions of sustainable development in elaborating \r\nand implementing its national development plan. More \r\nspecifically, in support of the Global Action Programme \r\non Education for Sustainable Development, my country \r\nhas been focusing on expanding access and equity, \r\nimproving the quality of teaching and learning and \r\nimproving governance in the educational sector.\r\nWe are are pleased with the increased access of \r\ngirls to schools. Over 10 years, their enrolment rate has \r\nincreased from 70 per cent to nearly 105 per cent. We \r\nare implementing plans to build thousands of schools, \r\nwithout neglecting in-depth reforms in that area.\r\nClimate change is one of our greatest concerns, as \r\nit is a threat to humankind and our fundamental rights. \r\nEvery State has the responsibility to contribute to \r\nlimiting its impact. My country and the other countries \r\nin the Congo basin — home to the second-largest forest \r\nreserve in the world — are equipped, through the \r\nCentral African Forest Commission, to help improve \r\nthe quality of life on our planet. For its part, my country \r\nintends to uphold all of its commitments, beginning \r\nwith the ratification of the Paris Agreement, which is \r\nnow under way.\r\nLike peace, political stability is for us a constant \r\nobjective of our domestic policy. In that vein, for nearly \r\na year we have been engaging in a dialogue that for \r\nus is a standing method of settling political disputes. \r\nIn that connection, I would like to pay tribute to the \r\nAfrican Union and other regional organizations. We are \r\ngrateful for their support in that process. I also welcome \r\nthe efforts of all the political forces in my country \r\nwho, in the search for a comprehensive consensus \r\non the electoral process, arrived at the agreement of \r\n31 December 2016, the ultimate aim of which is the \r\nholding of elections.\r\nAt the request of all stakeholders for a new electoral \r\nregister, voter registration has been under way for more \r\nthan a year now. The last phase has just begun in the \r\nlast two provinces in the centre of the country. We are \r\npleased that more than 42 million voters of the projected \r\n45 million have already been registered. In addition, \r\na series of evaluations of the electoral process was \r\nstarted some 10 days ago by the National Monitoring \r\nCouncil, jointly with the Government and the Electoral \r\nCommission, which should allow for the publication of \r\nthe electoral calendar by the Commission, which is the \r\nonly competent institution in that regard.\r\nDespite that progress, however, the challenges of \r\norganizing elections in my country remain enormous \r\nin terms of logistics, finances, security and legislation. \r\nWe are confronting those obstacles with humility, but \r\nalso with indisputable tenacity. Given the advances \r\nthat have been made, I affirm that we are moving \r\ntowards credible, transparent and peaceful elections \r\nand that our progress in that direction is irreversible, all \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 3/25\r\nwithout external interference or any fiats. I ask the true \r\nfriends of my country to sincerely support our ongoing \r\nelectoral process.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations imposes \r\nobligations on us, including striving to building a \r\nbetter world. For that reason, the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo maintains a strategic dialogue with the \r\nUnited Nations on the future of the United Nations \r\nOrganization Stabilization Mission in the Democratic \r\nRepublic of the Congo (MONUSCO), in accordance with \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolution. That strategic \r\nreview should determine the pace of the reduction of \r\nthe MONUSCO force until its full withdrawal.\r\nIt is clear that, after almost 20 years of deployment, \r\nthe United Nations force cannot expect to stay in my \r\ncountry indefinitely or to exercise its mandate in \r\nthe same format and without drawing lessons from \r\nthe weaknesses that have been identified. What is \r\nimportant to us, and what should be important to \r\neverybody, is the credibility of the Organization and \r\nthe effectiveness of the contribution of United Nations \r\ntroops on the ground. That is why, for several years \r\nnow, we have been requesting the adjustment of the \r\nMONUSCO force to suit its dynamic missions, and the \r\nreorientation of resources thus freed up towards meeting \r\nour development needs. In that area, as in others, we \r\ndo not intend to compromise on the respect due to the \r\nsovereignty of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nwhich is guaranteed by the Charter of the Organization.\r\nI would like to believe that all who place their hopes \r\nin the United Nations — including my country — will \r\nfully commit to the implementation of the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals and to the long-awaited reform of \r\nthe Organization. I wish the Assembly every success in \r\nits work.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the President of the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Joseph Kabila Kabange, President of the \r\nDemocratic Republic of the Congo, was escorted \r\nfrom the General Assembly Hall.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nAddress by Mr. Taban Deng Gai, First \r\nVice-President of the Republic of South Sudan\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the First Vice-President of the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan.\r\nMr. Taban Deng Gai, First Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan, was escorted to \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Taban Deng Gai, First Vice-President \r\nof the Republic of South Sudan, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Gai (South Sudan): I am honoured to deliver \r\nthis statement on behalf of His Excellency Mr. Salva \r\nKiir Mayardit, President of the Republic of South \r\nSudan, who unfortunately could not be present today \r\nowing to pressing domestic commitments back home.\r\nI wish to congratulate you, Sir, on your election as \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession. South Sudan affirms it commitment to playing \r\nits role in supporting you as you lead this historic \r\nsession. I would also like to take this opportunity to \r\ncongratulate His Excellency Mr. António Guterres and \r\nhis Deputy, Her Excellency Amina Mohammed, for \r\nwinning the confidence of this institution. South Sudan \r\nstands ready to cooperate and work closely with them.\r\nThe theme the President selected for this session, \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”, resonates very \r\nwell with the aspirations of our nation for peace, \r\nunity, development and prosperity. It is also in line \r\nwith President Salva Kiir Mayardit’s declaration of \r\n2017 as the Year of Peace and Prosperity. That solemn \r\ndeclaration is intended to cement our resolve that the \r\naspirations of our people, for which they have fought \r\nlong and hard, be realized.\r\nHowever, the realization of peace is greatly impeded \r\nby a lack of resources. We commend the efforts of the \r\nIntergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), \r\nthe African Union (AU) and international partners \r\nto shun and isolate political actors who seek power \r\nthrough violence. We urge all stakeholders to continue \r\nembracing that common position, and we renew our \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n4/25 17-29801\r\ncommitment to further building on the progress we \r\nhave made in order to ensure that our people inherit the \r\nfuture that we have always envisioned and aspired to.\r\nNonetheless, we do not wish to delude ourselves \r\nthat peace, unity and development can be achieved \r\novernight. On the contrary, they require relentless \r\nand concerted efforts, dedication and commitment by \r\nall partners, which we are willingly, consciously and \r\nvigorously pursuing.\r\nWe strongly believe that peace is not a one-day \r\naffair or event. For us and our friendly partners in \r\npeace, there is simply no other viable alternative to \r\nmaking peace. Nonetheless, bringing about peace takes \r\ntime. Attaining peace in South Sudan is a process that \r\nwill require our collective efforts. It is a consistent \r\nand persistent accumulation of positive steps towards \r\nachieving the world that we envision for the future \r\ngenerations in our country, in our continent and in our \r\nworld at large.\r\nIt is therefore against that backdrop that the South \r\nSudanese Transitional Government of National Unity \r\nhas embraced the full implementation of the Agreement \r\non the Resolution of the Conflict in the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan as the only instrument pivotal to achieving \r\nthat mission and vision. By way of updating the General \r\nAssembly, allow me to highlight some of the important \r\nsteps that our Government has taken to further enhance \r\nthe achievement of peace in our young country.\r\nThe Transitional Government of National Unity \r\ncontinues to stand by its commitment to implementing \r\nthe unilateral ceasefire that was announced by President \r\nSalva Kiir Mayardit in May 2017, and continues to \r\ncall to estranged opposition groups to reciprocate our \r\ngesture of extending an olive branch.\r\nWith support from friendly partners, the \r\nGovernment has embarked upon implementing key \r\naspects of the transitional security arrangements, such \r\nas security-sector reform, the cantonment of forces and \r\nthe training of the Joint Integrated Police (JIP) in an \r\neffort to demilitarize our communities. We hope that the \r\nrecently graduated JIP for Juba will be an example that \r\ncan be emulated in other security sector institutions, \r\nespecially through the overhaul and restructuring of \r\nthe Sudan People’s Liberation Army into a professional \r\nnational army.\r\nThe Transitional Government of National \r\nUnity is spearheading grass-roots intercommunal \r\npeace initiatives, as ongoing communal conflicts \r\ncharacterized by cattle-rustling, child abduction, high \r\nbride dowry and land disputes can be serious stumbling \r\nblocks to peace. It is essential to find ways to transform \r\nthe way our communities interact with each other, and \r\nthe international community should encourage and \r\nsupport Government efforts and invest in measures \r\naimed at addressing those local conflicts so that \r\nsuccess stories can be replicated all over South Sudan \r\nat different phases of our national dialogue.\r\nIt is in that area that I would like to highlight the role \r\nof young South Sudanese as either agents of, or detractors \r\nfrom, peace. One example of an intercommunal feud \r\ninvolving cattle-rustling and child abduction almost \r\nescalated into an uncontrolled conflict simply because \r\nthe youth from the different communities were incited \r\nto violence. That makes us appreciate that our collective \r\neffort to ensure the situation in South Sudan can be \r\nsalvaged only by embracing peace.\r\nI also wish to highlight the important role that South \r\nSudanese women continue to play as peacebuilders and \r\ncustodians of intercommunal peace initiatives.\r\nIt is against that background that the Transitional \r\nGovernment of National Unity, with the support of \r\nreligious leaders, the United Nations Mission in South \r\nSudan, the United Nations Development Programme \r\nand other partners, is engaging in grass-roots, \r\npeople-to-people peace by investing in improving \r\neconomic activities among communities, such as \r\nbuilding markets, rehabilitating schools, constructing \r\nfishing storage facilities and peacefully disarming \r\narmed communities. All of that has improved relations \r\namong warring communities, host communities and \r\ninternally displaced persons.\r\nWe in South Sudan are currently optimistic about \r\nthe return of peace. We have recently witnessed \r\nrefugees and internally displaced persons gradually \r\nreturning to their villages voluntarily, and several \r\nsteps within communities indicate that the movement \r\ntowards coexistence and living in harmony is a reality.\r\nThere will be challenges and reversals, but the \r\ndirection of movement should be the big picture. We \r\nare very open to listening to counsel and to joint action, \r\nbut we also expect our partners to acknowledge and \r\nreciprocate progress and to demonstrate some sense of \r\nrespect and trust. An overtly confrontational approach \r\nrisks creating a siege-and-bunker mentality. However, \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 5/25\r\nwe are confident that soon violence and wars will be \r\nstories of the past in the Republic of South Sudan.\r\nThe national dialogue initiative declared by \r\nPresident Salva Kiir Mayardit is making strong and \r\nsteady progress with regard to the Government’s \r\ncommitment to addressing a number of political and \r\nsecurity issues, with a view to creating an enabling \r\nenvironment for dialogue. Some major steps taken \r\ninclude the release of prisoners, including journalists; \r\nthe expansion of the Steering Committee to include \r\nall the relevant stakeholders in the country; an \r\nongoing effort to reach out to opposition figures; and \r\na declaration of unilateral cessation of hostilities. The \r\nprimary objective of the national dialogue initiative is \r\nto promote reconciliation and enhance confidence in the \r\npeace process so as to make dialogue not just the only \r\nviable option for resolving conflict but also a foundation \r\nfor the national constitutional review process.\r\nAt this juncture, I would like to note that the Steering \r\nCommittee for the National Dialogue Initiative has \r\nembarked upon engagement with all shades of political \r\nopinion, in particular those living outside South Sudan, \r\nin order to ensure that the national dialogue is inclusive \r\nand that its outcomes reflect the views of all components \r\nof the South Sudanese community.\r\nThe Steering Committee is engaging teams \r\nof resource persons who will go to all the states, \r\ncounties, payams and bomas to organize meetings with \r\nrepresentatives of the relevant groups to seek their \r\nviews on the grievances held by their people and to \r\nensure that those grievances are effectively addressed \r\nand remedied. The results of those discussions in the \r\nstates will be reported to the Steering Committee, which \r\nwill in turn present them to the larger national dialogue \r\nconference. The process will end with recommendations \r\nand resolutions that will be presented to the national \r\nleadership under the presidency and to the national \r\nParliament for final adoption and implementation.\r\nOur Government is supportive of the efforts \r\naimed at revitalizing the implementation of the peace \r\nagreement. We recently convened in our capital, \r\nJuba, a meeting of the IGAD Council of Ministers to \r\ndeliberate on ways to further expedite the preparation \r\nfor the establishment of a high-level revitalization \r\nforum, which is envisaged to focus on practical ways \r\nto expedite the implementation of the peace agreement.\r\nToday South Sudan enjoys cordial relations with \r\nits neighbours. Those countries — Ethiopia, Kenya, \r\nthe Sudan and Uganda — are hosting South Sudanese \r\nrefugees, providing corridors for humanitarian \r\naccess and supporting development projects, all of \r\nwhich further enhance the efforts of the Transitional \r\nGovernment of National Unity to bring about peace. \r\nWe are dependent upon those good relations in order \r\nto revive and increase oil production, construct and \r\nmaintain important road infrastructure and provide \r\nelectricity in the border towns — key ingredients for \r\nboosting the economy and work as incentives for peace.\r\nConcerning Abyei, our Government reaffirms its \r\nwillingness and readiness to implement the proposal \r\nof the African Union High-level Implementation Panel \r\nfor the Sudan and South Sudan, of 21 September 2012, \r\nwhich, as presented by the Panel, was accepted by \r\nPresident Salva Kiir Mayardit. We are hopeful that \r\nthe Republic of the Sudan and the Republic of South \r\nSudan will soon resume cooperation in implementing \r\nthat proposal.\r\nI wish to report to the Assembly that our Government \r\nis cooperating with the United Nations Mission in South \r\nSudan and is facilitating the deployment of the Regional \r\nProtection Force (RPF). In the past few months we have \r\nwitnessed the arrival of members of the advance RPF, \r\nas agreed with the United Nations. The Government \r\nreaffirms its commitment to working closely with \r\nthe United Nations, the AU and IGAD to oversee the \r\nsmooth implementation and operationalization of the \r\nmandate of those troops in South Sudan.\r\nThe Transitional Government of National Unity \r\ncontinues to work towards ensuring that humanitarian \r\naccess to those in need is unhindered. That has been \r\ndone through continuous and open dialogue with aid \r\nagencies striving to have more humanitarian corridors \r\nopened up. I wish to commend the concerted efforts \r\nof the various humanitarian agencies that responded \r\npositively and worked to reverse the famine situation in \r\nparts of South Sudan. Despite some gains, I stress that \r\ncontinued support is necessary if we are to achieve a \r\nhunger-free South Sudan. I wish to take this opportunity \r\nto express our condolences and prayers to the families \r\nof those humanitarian aid workers who lost their lives \r\nin the line of duty in the Republic of South Sudan.\r\nWhile we appreciate that saving lives is important, \r\nwe also ought to save livelihoods. We cannot continue \r\nto mop the f loor while the tap is open. The old \r\n“humanitarian intervention first and development \r\nlater” paradigm is not a viable policy in the case of \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n6/25 17-29801\r\nSouth Sudan. It is important to incentivize peace and \r\nstability through a balanced approach to development \r\nand embracing a new way of working. Stabilization \r\nand recovery initiatives are essential, and emergency \r\nsupport needs to be effectively complemented with \r\nsome level of economic dynamism that provides a new \r\nplatform for social cohesion and resilience-building.\r\nAs partners, we all need to do business differently. \r\nAs a Government, we will redouble our efforts to \r\nensure access and improve the enabling environment \r\nfor humanitarian intervention. It is our expectation that \r\na smart combination and calibration of development \r\nand humanitarian support is needed to maintain \r\npositive momentum.\r\nOur ultimate goal and responsibility is to provide \r\nan opportunity for peace to all South Sudanese people, \r\none that will enable them to choose their own leaders \r\nthrough free, fair and credible elections. Our focus \r\nfor the remaining months of the transitional period, \r\ntherefore, is to ensure that adequate preparation and a \r\nenvironment conducive to those elections are our top \r\npriorities, and we will see to it that peace is realized \r\nand that sufficient resources are allocated to that task.\r\nThese efforts are core building blocks and \r\nprerequisites for boosting confidence among and \r\nwithin our communities, which will stimulate them to \r\nvoluntarily and gradually return to their homes. I would \r\nlike to reiterate our position that those efforts can be \r\nsustained if, and only if, all political actors continue to \r\nrespect and reciprocate the unilateral ceasefire declared \r\nby President Salva Kiir Mayardit earlier this year.\r\nThe progress we speak of can come about only when \r\nwe start to see progress in the reform of the Security \r\nCouncil. Reform of the Council is an urgent task, since \r\nits current composition and functioning do not reflect the \r\nrealities of the international community in the twenty-\r\nfirst century. In order to achieve concrete progress on \r\nCouncil reform, it is imperative to launch text-based \r\nnegotiations in the intergovernmental negotiations \r\nduring the Assembly’s seventy-second session.\r\nIn that connection, South Sudan wishes to add \r\nits voice in expressing its concerns with regard to the \r\nincreasing tensions on the Korean peninsula. South \r\nSudan supports the call of the international community \r\nurging North Korea to fully comply with the relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions on nuclear tests and \r\nballistic-missile launches. South Sudan urges North \r\nKorea to show sincere will and concrete actions towards \r\nthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\r\nWith regard to climate change, although South \r\nSudan’s greenhouse-gas emissions are negligible, it is \r\none of the countries worst affected by climate change. The \r\ncountry is experiencing recurring droughts. According \r\nto the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, \r\nit is the fastest-warming country in the region, with \r\nf looding and the loss of biodiversity and of livelihoods. \r\nI am glad to inform the Assembly that South Sudan has \r\nratified the Paris Agreement on Climate Change and \r\nhas prepared its national determined contributions and \r\nnational adaptation programme of action to implement \r\nthe projects embodied in both documents.\r\nAllow me now to extend my appreciation to the \r\ncountries members of IGAD, IGAD-Plus, the AU and \r\nthe Troika, and China, Japan, Germany and the broader \r\ninternational community for their support for the peace \r\nprocess and development in my country. Although \r\nwe appreciate that South Sudan as a nation cannot \r\noperate in isolation, the direction of the way forward \r\nmust be South-Sudanese-led and its solutions must be \r\nhome grown if we are genuinely striving to achieve \r\nsustainable results.\r\nLong live South Sudan. Long live the United Nations.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the First Vice-President of the Republic \r\nof South Sudan for the statement he has just made.\r\nMr. Taban Deng Gai, First Vice-President of \r\nthe Republic of South Sudan, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Yosiwo George, Vice-President \r\nof the Federated States of Micronesia\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Vice-President of the Federated States \r\nof Micronesia.\r\nMr. Yosiwo George, Vice-President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia, was escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Yosiwo George, Vice-President of \r\nthe Federated States of Micronesia, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly\r\nMr. George (Federated States of Micronesia): Let \r\nme at the outset congratulate you, Sir, on assuming \r\nyour role as President of the General Assembly. I \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 7/25\r\nalso congratulate your predecessor, Ambassador \r\nPeter Thomson of Fiji, for a job well done over the \r\npast year. I must also mention the Secretary-General, \r\nMr. António Guterres. Since assuming the leadership \r\nof the Organization a few months ago, he has already \r\nshown himself to be more than equal to the tremendous \r\ntasks associated with his high office.\r\nAs we gather here today in this great Hall, natural \r\ndisasters and calamities are striking in many parts of \r\nour world. Hurricanes, typhoons and earthquakes have \r\ndevastated communities and displaced thousands of \r\npeople in just the past few days. To the victims and \r\ntheir families around the world, I offer our sympathies \r\nand condolences on behalf of the Government and the \r\npeople of the Federated States of Micronesia.\r\nWe condemn terrorist attacks, which have taken \r\ninnocent lives. Micronesia pledges its resolve to stand \r\nunited against terrorism, in solidarity with affected \r\nnations. On behalf of the Micronesian Government and \r\nits people, I offer our deepest condolences to all those \r\nnations and families that have suffered losses at the \r\nhands of terrorists.\r\nAs we witness current record-breaking megastorms, \r\nwe cannot ignore their connection to climate change, \r\nespecially to ocean warming and sea-level rise. In \r\nthe wake of those devastating events, we must not \r\nonly stay committed to our collective fight against \r\nclimate change, but we must also redouble our efforts. \r\nClimate change is one of the most serious threats \r\nto global peace and security, endangering the very \r\nexistence of our islands. It needs to be at the top of the \r\nagenda of the General Assembly. As the United Nations \r\nundertakes efforts to reorient its work around the \r\npriorities of peace and prevention, the United Nations \r\nsystem will have to adapt. We reiterate our call for \r\nthe appointment of a special representative on climate \r\nchange and security.\r\nClimate change mitigation is also essential to \r\nachieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nand the targets of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, including the eradication of poverty, \r\nending hunger, building resilient infrastructure \r\nand shared prosperity. Without progress in fighting \r\nclimate change, our sustainable development efforts \r\nwill be futile. That is particularly true for small island \r\ndeveloping States.\r\nThe Paris Agreement on Climate Change has \r\nprovided an avenue to enhance cooperation in our fight \r\nagainst climate change, and the world must seize the \r\nmoment. Micronesia expresses grave concern that some \r\ncountries have chosen to break with the international \r\ncommunity and neglect the Paris Agreement, against \r\nthe best scientific advice. As a small island developing \r\nnation at the forefront of the battle, Micronesia calls on \r\nall States to fully engage in global efforts to implement \r\nthe Paris Agreement, support the Green Climate \r\nFund and access thereto, and contribute innovative \r\nclimate solutions.\r\nI would like to share with the Assembly a story \r\nof global cooperation at its finest. This is a story of \r\na treaty that was designed to save the ozone layer and \r\nsucceeded, but it has also made major contributions to \r\nclimate-change mitigation. The Montreal Protocol on \r\nSubstances that Deplete the Ozone Layer is considered \r\nthe most successful multilateral environmental treaty of \r\nall time. That is why the 194 parties to the Protocol met \r\nlast year in Kigali and agreed to amend the Protocol and \r\nexpand its scope. Specifically, the Kigali Amendment \r\nallows the Protocol to regulate hydrofluorocarbons \r\n(HFCs), which are chemicals used in refrigeration and \r\nair conditioning that can contribute significantly to \r\nglobal warming. Phasing down the use of HFCs will \r\nhelp prevent 0.5°C of global temperature rise, and \r\ncomplementary energy-efficiency measures in the \r\nsame sector could help avoid another 0.5°C of warming.\r\nWe thank the parties to the Montreal Protocol that \r\nhave already ratified the Kigali Amendment, totalling \r\neight out of the 20 needed for the Agreement to enter into \r\nforce. We call on other parties to ratify the Agreement \r\nas soon as possible, ideally before the next Meeting of \r\nthe Parties, in Canada in November.\r\nAlong with the Paris Agreement, the Kigali \r\nAmendment is a major step towards the survival of small \r\nisland States. As the story of the Kigali Amendment \r\ndemonstrates, with intelligence, perseverance and \r\ncooperation, we can achieve anything. That is the \r\nmotivation that keeps us all working together for a \r\nbetter future.\r\nIn the islands we say the ocean is us, as we are the \r\nocean. As an island nation, Micronesia fully supported \r\nand participated actively in the United Nations \r\nOcean Conference in June. The Call for Action from \r\nthe Conference, entitled “Our Ocean, Our Future,” \r\nhighlights the actions required to achieve the targets \r\nof Sustainable Development Goal 14. Micronesia \r\nsupports the intention to organize a second United \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n8/25 17-29801\r\nNations Ocean Conference, in 2020, which will enable \r\nus to follow up on the commitments made at the first \r\nConference and to assess our progress towards the full \r\nimplementation of SDG 14 by 2030. We look forward to \r\nthe work of the Special Envoy for the Ocean to maintain \r\nthe momentum.\r\nAt the recent Pacific Islands Forum Leaders \r\nMeeting in Samoa, our leaders endorsed the Blue \r\nPacific identity as the core driver of collective action in \r\nthe Pacific region. That was a fitting progression from \r\nlast year’s Pohnpei Oceans Statement, as elements of \r\nthe Blue Pacific narrative reinforce the potential for \r\nshared stewardship of the Pacific Ocean.\r\nWe must now show ambition in tackling the \r\nmounting threats to the health of our ocean. The special \r\ncase of small island developing States must be enshrined \r\nin the forthcoming implementing agreement under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. We \r\nwelcome the successful conclusion of the meetings of \r\nthe Preparatory Committee, and now we must urgently \r\nlaunch and conclude the intergovernmental conference \r\nto draft and adopt a new legally binding agreement.\r\nFor Pacific islands, fisheries are a mainstay of \r\nour economies, our most important renewable natural \r\nresource and an integral part of our sustainable \r\ndevelopment plans. Effective conservation and \r\nmanagement of our tuna resource is important not \r\nonly for us who depend on it for our livelihoods and \r\nsustainable development, but also for addressing global \r\nfood-security concerns. We must remain steadfast in our \r\nefforts to combat illegal, unreported and unregulated \r\nfishing in all its forms.\r\nI want to take this opportunity to express our \r\nconcerns about the lack of recognition of, and respect \r\nfor, the rights of coastal States such as Micronesia \r\nto manage fisheries in their own exclusive economic \r\nzones (EEZs). In the Western and Central Pacific, some \r\ndeveloped-country fishing nations are advocating for \r\nf lag-based rights in regional fisheries management \r\norganizations. Such measures would undermine existing \r\nzone-based management measures and erode the ability \r\nof small island developing States, as resource owners, to \r\nexercise their sovereign rights under international law. \r\nThat would not be an acceptable outcome. Therefore, we \r\ncall on those developed-country partners to withdraw \r\nall such proposals and to actively support the efforts of \r\nsmall island developing States to increase benefits from \r\nthe sustainable management of fisheries in their EEZs.\r\nAllow me to briefly thank the Secretary-General \r\nfor his proposals on the peace and security architecture, \r\nmanagement reform and other reform processes for the \r\nOrganization. We commend his proposals, which will \r\nresult in a more transparent, efficient and effective \r\nregime that is able to respond to the challenges our \r\nworld is facing today. The United Nations must be fit for \r\npurpose. While reforms are vital to any organization, \r\nthey must not disadvantage small island developing \r\nStates; they must leave no one behind.\r\nFor many years now, my country has also paid \r\npriority attention to the efforts by Member States to \r\nreform the Security Council, but those efforts have \r\nresulted in little progress. We need to break out of this \r\ncycle. It is high time to shift to real negotiations.\r\nIn the Western Pacific, and especially in our \r\ngreater Micronesian region, the provocative and \r\naggressive actions by the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea pose a threat to regional security and must be \r\ncondemned in the strongest possible terms. Micronesia \r\nsupports the actions taken by the Security Council. We \r\ncall on the Council and on countries with the power \r\nand influence to help resolve the crisis to take action \r\nimmediately to ensure that peace is achieved on the \r\nKorean peninsula.\r\nWe gather in this great Hall and debate among \r\nnations, but we are speaking for our peoples. We \r\nare trying to advance their interests. We are seeking \r\nto improve their lives. As history has taught us, we \r\nwill fail our nations and our peoples unless we work \r\ntogether for the common good. The 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development constitutes a people-centred \r\napproach. Consistent with that principle, the theme \r\nof this session of the General Assembly is “Focusing \r\non people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet”. We must believe in such a \r\nfuture and move towards it together. Multilateralism \r\nand the United Nations are more important than ever. \r\nOnly together can we restore and maintain peace and \r\nsecurity. Only together can we overcome the threat of \r\nglobal climate change. Only together can we build a \r\nsustainable future for our planet and all of our peoples.\r\nThe President: On behalf of the General Assembly, \r\nI wish to thank the Vice-President of the Federated \r\nStates of Micronesia for the statement he has just made.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 9/25\r\nMr. Yosiwo George, Vice-President of the \r\nFederated States of Micronesia, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic of \r\nNepal\r\nThe President: The Assembly will now hear an \r\naddress by the Prime Minister of the Federal Democratic \r\nRepublic of Nepal.\r\nMr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, was \r\nescorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe President: I have great pleasure in welcoming \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime \r\nMinister of the Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, \r\nand inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. Deuba (Nepal): I bring to the General Assembly \r\nwarm greetings from the people and the Government of \r\nNepal, the land of Lord Buddha and Mount Everest, as \r\nwell as best wishes for the success of this session.\r\nI congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nI pledge my full support to you as you discharge your \r\nimportant responsibilities. I also wish to put on record \r\nour appreciation for your predecessor, Ambassador \r\nPeter Thomson of Fiji, for his sterling leadership.\r\nI wish to warmly congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. António Guterres on his appointment as the \r\nSecretary-General. We extend to him our best wishes \r\nand full support, including for his efforts aimed at \r\nreforming the Organization to make it fit for purpose. \r\nI also commend his predecessor, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for \r\nhis dynamic leadership of the Organization during his \r\ntwo terms of office.\r\nIt has been more than two decades since I first \r\naddressed the Assembly from this rostrum (see \r\nA/50/PV.37). In the decades that followed, the world \r\nwitnessed a profound transformation. While there have \r\nbeen some notable achievements in poverty reduction, \r\nschool enrolment, gender equality and in combating \r\ncommunicable diseases, those successes have not come \r\nwithout multiple and complex challenges. The world has \r\nbecome more interdependent and better connected, and \r\ngrowing interdependence and pluralism have unleashed \r\nboth challenges and opportunities. A large geopolitical \r\ntransformation is still in the making.\r\nThe rise of inward-looking tendencies in some \r\nnation States, marked by a tide of populism on both the \r\nleft and the right, has created confusion in the course of \r\nworld politics. The global community today is facing a \r\nmore complex and polarized environment than before, \r\nwith multiple transnational challenges ranging from \r\nterrorism, climate change and energy deficiency to \r\nfood insecurity, mass migration and extremism. Ethnic \r\ntensions and intra-State conflicts have taken their toll on \r\nmillions of innocent lives, while the suffering of people \r\nin Syria, Iraq, Libya and Yemen continues unabated. \r\nUnfortunately, our efforts to help have been too little \r\nand often too late. All of those challenges reinforce the \r\nrole and responsibility of the United Nations.\r\nAs we embark upon the path of implementing \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, those \r\nchallenges are the litmus test for our leadership. \r\nThe choice of the theme for our deliberations at this \r\nsession of the General Assembly, “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on \r\na sustainable planet”, provides a clear direction to \r\nfollow. However, the path to peace and a decent life \r\nfor all will remain elusive without the resources and \r\ncommitment needed to implement the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals. Delivering on commitments, \r\nmaking the process inclusive, coordinating efforts and \r\nshared responsibilities and backing up our efforts with \r\nadequate resources are all essential if we are to secure a \r\nsustainable future and ensure that no one is left behind.\r\nThe vicious race to acquire weapons of mass \r\ndestruction continues to threaten the world. Nepal calls \r\nfor time-bound general and complete disarmament. \r\nNepal welcomes the confidence-building measures on \r\nconventional weapons that ended nearly two decades \r\nof stalemate in the United Nations Disarmament \r\nCommission. Nepal signed the Treaty on the \r\nProhibition of Nuclear Weapons as a step towards \r\nnuclear disarmament.\r\nNepal deplores the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea’s continued defiance of the repeated calls \r\nmade by the Security Council and the international \r\ncommunity. We urge the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea to abide by all the relevant resolutions of \r\nthe Security Council. We believe that this approach \r\nalone will safeguard peace and promote stability on \r\nthe Korean peninsula. As host to the United Nations \r\nRegional Centre for Peace and Disarmament in \r\nAsia and the Pacific, Nepal emphasizes the need to \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n10/25 17-29801\r\nreactivate regional disarmament deliberations under \r\nthe Kathmandu process.\r\nTerrorism is a curse on humankind and today’s \r\nbiggest threat to democracy and development. Nepal \r\ncondemns terrorism in all its forms and manifestations \r\neverywhere in the world. The world must come together \r\nto address not just the symptoms of terrorism but \r\nalso its root causes. An early conclusion of a global \r\nanti-terrorism convention is the call of our times.\r\nHaving contributed more than 130,000 peacekeepers \r\nto United Nations peacekeeping operations in some of \r\nthe most challenging situations, we have shown a true \r\ncommitment to the success of such operations. Nepal \r\nis prepared to continue to provide troops and civilian \r\npersonnel for this noble cause. Nepal hosts a world-\r\nclass peacekeeping training centre, the oldest in the \r\nregion. The United Nations can make the best use of \r\nthat facility by helping to develop it as a regional centre \r\nof excellence for peacekeeping training.\r\nNepal firmly believes that all troop- and \r\npolice-contributing countries should be given a fair \r\nopportunity to serve in leadership positions, both in \r\nthe field and at Headquarters, commensurate with their \r\nlevel and length of contribution.\r\nThe protection of civilians should be at the centre \r\nof peacekeeping operations. Nepal believes that \r\nprotecting the safety and security of peacekeepers \r\nis key to enhancing their ability to deliver from the \r\nhighest possible moral ground.\r\nOn sexual exploitation and abuse, we must move \r\nfrom zero tolerance to the zero-case scenario. It is in that \r\nspirit that Nepal endorsed the Kigali Principles on the \r\nProtection of Civilians in their entirety and signed the \r\nSecretary-General’s Voluntary Compact on Preventing \r\nand Addressing Sexual Exploitation and Abuse.\r\nThe Constitution of Nepal accommodates the \r\naspirations of all of its citizens. It guarantees a \r\ncomprehensive set of internationally recognized \r\nhuman rights and fundamental freedoms. We are fully \r\ncommitted to the promotion and protection of those \r\nrights and to their being fully enjoyed by our people. \r\nThe Constitution establishes powerful commissions to \r\npromote and protect the specific rights and interests \r\nof women, Dalits, Muslims, Madhesis, indigenous \r\npeople and other disadvantaged communities. The \r\nNational Human Rights Commission, an independent \r\nconstitutional body, is responsible for comprehensively \r\nmonitoring the human rights situation in the country \r\nand investigating violations.\r\nNepal views the right to life as the most important \r\nof all human rights. Nepal’s Constitution bans the \r\ndeath penalty in all circumstances. As a party to 24 \r\ninternational human rights instruments, including \r\nseven out of nine core instruments, Nepal has been \r\nfulfilling its international obligations with all sincerity \r\nand to the best of its ability.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, Nepal has presented its \r\ncandidature for membership in the Human Rights \r\nCouncil for the 2018-2020 term. Nepal’s first-ever \r\nelection to the Human Rights Council would be an \r\nacknowledgement of our long-standing commitment to, \r\nand contributions in, the field of human rights. It would \r\nalso encourage us to do more at the national and global \r\nlevels. We seek the invaluable support of all Member \r\nStates for Nepal’s candidature.\r\nNepal calls for concerted efforts at the national, \r\nregional and international levels to ensure that the \r\nmigration process creates a fair, win-win situation for \r\nall. We call for the safety, security, dignity and well-\r\nbeing of all migrant workers. Although not a party to \r\nthe Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of \r\nRefugees, Nepal has earnestly upheld humanitarian \r\nprinciples by hosting thousands of refugees.\r\nMrs. Nusseibeh (United Arab Emirates), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nProtecting minorities and their rights makes the \r\nworld more humane and contributes to world peace \r\nand stability. The forced eviction of citizens is a grave \r\ncrime against humanity. We call on the international \r\ncommunity to respond responsibly and act decisively in \r\nall circumstances in support of the right of refugees to \r\nreturn safely to their homelands with dignity and with \r\nthe hope of rapid reintegration.\r\nThe cost in terms of human tragedy and devastation \r\ncaused by natural disasters is increasing sharply. We \r\ncall for greater global cooperation and coordination in \r\nprevention, mitigation and recovery. The trauma of the \r\n2015 earthquake in Nepal has not yet subsided. Post-\r\ndisaster reconstruction remains ongoing. We thank \r\nour neighbours, development partners, other friendly \r\ncountries and the United Nations family for their \r\ngenerous support in our drive to rebuild.\r\nPoor and vulnerable countries suffer \r\ndisproportionately from climate change despite \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 11/25\r\ntheir negligible greenhouse-gas emissions. The \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change should be \r\nimplemented in coordination with the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development.\r\nThe least developed countries represent the most \r\nvulnerable group of countries. They must not be \r\nperennially equated with dehumanizing conditions of \r\npoverty and underdevelopment. Rather, they must be \r\nempowered to smoothly and sustainably graduate to \r\nhigher standards of living at an early date.\r\nAs the cost of trade is higher for landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries than for coastal countries, \r\ndeveloping multimodal-transport infrastructure and \r\nproviding unhindered transit rights to landlocked \r\nnations is critical to their sustainable development. \r\nWe call for the full implementation of the Istanbul \r\nProgramme of Action, the Vienna Programme of Action \r\nand the Addis Ababa Action Agenda in order to benefit \r\nfrom the potential synergies, in coordination with the \r\n2030 Agenda.\r\nThe essence of Nepal’s foreign policy is \r\nPanchsheel — the five principles of peaceful coexistence \r\nthat are derived from the teachings of Lord Buddha, the \r\nenlightened son of Nepal. Those principles serve as the \r\nfoundations for managing harmonious relations among \r\nnations at a time of increasing uncertainty and turmoil. \r\nWe also believe in non-alignment. In exercising our \r\nindependent foreign policy, we judge every issue on its \r\nmerit without fear or favour.\r\nWe consider regional cooperation to be an important \r\nmeans of building trust and confidence among nations \r\nand making the best use of complementarities for \r\nshared prosperity. Connectivity remains at the core \r\nof deeper integration and the creation of win-win \r\nsituations. Nepal firmly believes in the indispensability \r\nof the United Nations in multilateral affairs and global \r\ngovernance. All countries, particularly the major \r\nPowers, are responsible for contributing to the global \r\ngood by fulfilling their obligations and responsibilities.\r\nThe reform of the Security Council is long overdue. \r\nThe underrepresentation of developing countries in \r\nthe Council must be addressed in recognition of their \r\ngrowing contributions to shaping the global agenda. \r\nReform must be inclusive and representative in \r\nstructure, transparent and efficient in procedure and \r\naccountable and effective in delivery. The Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform proposals are a step in the right \r\ndirection. We believe a clear statement of support from \r\nMember States, such as the political declaration for \r\nUnited Nations reform issued earlier this week, helps \r\nmake the Organization more fit for purpose.\r\nAny repositioning of the United Nations development \r\nagenda should address gaps, build synergy and improve \r\naccountability, while steering clear of the politicization \r\nof development under any guise. Nepal supports the \r\nrevitalization exercise in the General Assembly with \r\na view, inter alia, to more streamlined functions and \r\nfairer gender and geographical representation in senior \r\nUnited Nations positions.\r\nBefore concluding, I would like to share some \r\ninsights into recent developments in Nepal. Our \r\npeaceful transition to democracy after a decade-long \r\narmed conflict demonstrates the power and promise \r\nof dialogue and negotiation as compared to the perils \r\nof violent methods for obtaining political control. The \r\nnational peace process that began in 2006 concluded \r\nwith the promulgation of a democratic and inclusive \r\nConstitution in 2015, through a popularly elected \r\nconstituent Assembly. This unique peace process was \r\nhome-grown and nationally driven. Its successful \r\nconclusion firmly established the culture of dialogue \r\nand accommodation in Nepal and could serve as a \r\nmodel for similar situations elsewhere. We appreciate \r\nthe support and understanding that the international \r\ncommunity provided.\r\nProportional representation of all sectors of our \r\nsociety is at the core of Nepal’s inclusive democracy. \r\nRecent local elections firmly established the role of \r\nwomen in politics and development. The Constitution \r\nguarantees that 40 per cent of representation at the local \r\nlevel and one third of representatives in the federal and \r\nprovincial parliaments are women. After the successful \r\nholding of local elections, dates have been announced \r\nfor the first provincial and federal parliamentary \r\nelections in 20 years, in two months’ time. The ongoing \r\ntransitional justice process combines the reality on the \r\nground with our international commitment to delivering \r\njustice and sustaining peace.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to reiterate Nepal’s \r\nprofound commitment to the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations. The Organization comprises \r\nlarge and small nations, and the vast majority of its \r\nmembership comes from smaller countries, which \r\nconfirms the universality and legitimacy of the \r\nworld body. But a platform for a peaceful, stable, \r\nrules-based and just world order cannot be erected \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n12/25 17-29801\r\nwithout addressing our genuine concerns for security, \r\ndevelopment and well-being.\r\nWe believe that small nations have been sincere and \r\nserious in discharging their responsibilities as Members \r\nof the Organization. Even with their meagre economic \r\nand security resources, they have played a constructive \r\nrole in it to promote peace, security and cooperation \r\nunder very difficult circumstances in many parts of \r\nthe world.\r\nI would like to recall the wise words of Bishweshwar \r\nPrasad Koirala, the first elected Prime Minister of \r\nNepal, who, in addressing the fifteenth session of the \r\nGeneral Assembly, in 1960, said,\r\n“Our physical strength may be negligible, but our \r\nmoral strength, if we are true to ourselves and to \r\nthe peoples for whom we speak, may be great” \r\n(A/PV.878, para. 228).\r\nThat statement is as relevant today as it was then. \r\nLet us collectively display our wisdom, knowledge \r\nand capacity to address the pressing issues of peace, \r\nsecurity, disarmament and sustainable development \r\nwith due respect for the internationally accepted rules \r\nin order to ensure a safe and stable world order.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nFederal Democratic Republic of Nepal for the statement \r\nhe has just made.\r\nMr. Sher Bahadur Deuba, Prime Minister of \r\nthe Federal Democratic Republic of Nepal, was \r\nescorted from the rostrum.\r\nAddress by Mr. Peter Paire O’Neill, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for the Autonomous \r\nRegion of Bougainville of the Independent State \r\nof Papua New Guinea\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor the Autonomous Region of Bougainville of the \r\nIndependent State of Papua New Guinea.\r\nMr. Peter Paire O’Neill, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for the Autonomous Region of Bougainville \r\nof the Independent State of Papua New Guinea, \r\nwas escorted to the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Peter Paire O’Neill, \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for the Autonomous Region \r\nof Bougainville of the Independent State of Papua New \r\nGuinea, and inviting him to address the Assembly.\r\nMr. O’Neill (Papua New Guinea): On behalf of \r\nmy Government and the people of Papua New Guinea, \r\nI am honoured to address the General Assembly. I \r\nam pleased to convey my country’s appreciation to \r\nthe outgoing President of the General Assembly, His \r\nExcellency Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, for his \r\noutstanding presidency this past year.\r\nAs he takes up his mandate, Papua New Guinea \r\nwelcomes and congratulates Mr. Miroslav Lajčák, \r\nand the Republic of Slovakia, on his election to the \r\npresidency of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. I pledge Papua New Guinea’s support \r\nfor his presidency and the priority areas he has chosen.\r\nI would also like to welcome and extend our best \r\nwishes for every success to His Excellency Mr. António \r\nGuterres, Secretary-General of the United Nations, \r\nin his new, vital and very demanding role. It is \r\nheartening to note his passion and drive to transform \r\nthe United Nations. The Organization can better \r\nserve the international community if it becomes more \r\naccountable, transparent, inclusive and fair, and to that \r\nend Mr. Guterres has Papua New Guinea’s strongest \r\nsupport. Let me also pay tribute to the former Secretary-\r\nGeneral, Mr. Ban Ki-moon, for his outstanding work \r\nduring his tenure.\r\nOur world continues to be confronted by multiple \r\nunprecedented challenges that are increasingly complex \r\nin nature. We are facing such serious adverse impacts \r\nas an uncertain global economy, climate change, the \r\ndeclining health of our marine habitats and heightened \r\nsecurity fears.\r\nThe challenges that we face are unlikely to be \r\novercome, or major goals achieved, by individual \r\ncountries acting on their own, which I am sure is a view \r\nshared by many. We must work together to build a better, \r\nmore stable and equitable world for all our citizens. We \r\nall have to do more, and we must renew our faith in the \r\npromise of the Charter of the United Nations, which \r\nremains a beacon of hope for humankind.\r\nPapua New Guinea recently held its tenth national \r\nelections. Our Government would like to put on record \r\nour profound appreciation to all of our development \r\npartners, including the United Nations, for the valued \r\nsupport provided to us as the elections were conducted.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 13/25\r\nSince being returned to office, our Government \r\nhas pledged to further increase our focus on the core \r\npolicies we have striven to implement during the past \r\nfive years. Those policies are changing the lives of \r\nour 8 million men, women and children for the better. \r\nWe have introduced free education across our entire \r\ncountry and doubled the number of children in school, \r\nmost of whom are girls. We are extending universal \r\nhealth care to our people, which is helping them to \r\nlive longer and is keeping families together. We have \r\ncommenced the largest infrastructure programme in our \r\nnation’s history, building more roads, ports and public \r\nbuildings, including hospitals. Our particular focus on \r\ninfrastructure is promoting economic development and \r\ngreater opportunity, especially for our rural majority. \r\nThose policies underpin our commitment to sustainable \r\neconomic growth and to achieving the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs).\r\nA nation such as Papua New Guinea can have all \r\nthe best intentions and plans to continue to move our \r\ncountry forward, but we live in a rapidly globalizing \r\nworld where events and influences transcend national \r\nborders. Many of the challenges that confront us today \r\nare not of our making; rather, we have to bear the \r\nconsequences of actions taken by others and must take \r\nup the task of addressing them.\r\nGlobal economic uncertainty, depressed \r\ncommodity prices and political instability all continue \r\nto undermine growth in many developing countries.\r\nPapua New Guinea remains concerned at the \r\ncontinuing threats of violence in the world today, be \r\nthey by terrorist groups or the actions of rogue States.\r\nWe condemn in the strongest possible terms the \r\nrecent nuclear missile tests by North Korea. They \r\nare direct threats to the lives of millions of innocent \r\npeople in the United States, Japan, South Korea, \r\nand more particularly in our Pacific region. We are \r\nconcerned that these activities are taking place in our \r\nbackyard. They are in direct breach of the will of the \r\ninternational community as expressed through the \r\nnumerous relevant resolutions of the Security Council. \r\nRather than inflamed rhetoric that could have drastic \r\nconsequences, we call for a peaceful resolution through \r\npolitical dialogue.\r\nOne of the greatest threats to humankind comes \r\nfrom within our global community of nations. Climate \r\nchange is real, and it is claiming lives and destroying \r\ncommunities. It is putting the future of nations at real \r\nrisk. The recent barrage of hurricanes that hit the \r\nCaribbean and the United States is just another example \r\nof some of the extreme weather events that we are all \r\nconfronting. Papua New Guinea offers its condolences \r\nto the countries affected and urges that the loss of life \r\nserve as another wake-up call for us all.\r\nPapua New Guinea and other Pacific island nations \r\nremain highly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of \r\nclimate change, including extreme tropical storms, \r\nsevere droughts and seawater f looding many coastal \r\ncommunities. The seeds of climate change that we \r\nsee today were laid by developed countries over past \r\ndecades and centuries. Although their own development \r\nwas enhanced, developing countries today continue \r\nto suffer because of their actions. The chances for \r\ndevelopment in smaller countries have been harmed by \r\nthe mess created by now-powerful nations. In Papua New \r\nGuinea and around the world, our peoples are dying as \r\na consequence, living standards are being eroded, and \r\nopportunities are disappearing. The world needs to step \r\nup its action and respond effectively to climate-change \r\nchallenges by making further commitments to reduce \r\nemissions and help affected communities.\r\nWe are committed to the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change and to implementing domestic \r\npolicies to reduce our own emissions. We welcome and \r\nsupport Fiji’s presidency of the twenty-third session \r\nof the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and will \r\nwork together for a successful meeting in Bonn.\r\nPapua New Guinea is an island nation. The very \r\nwell-being and economic development of our people \r\nis tied to the resources coming from our oceans and \r\nseas. We share growing concern about the declining \r\nhealth of the oceans and seas that sustain many nations. \r\nUncontrolled and poorly regulated human activities, \r\nincluding illegal, unregulated and unreported fishing, \r\npollutants, plastics and marine debris, are killing our \r\nwaterways. Global fish stocks are being decimated, \r\necosystems are being destroyed, and our people are \r\nbeing forced to abandon their traditional homes because \r\nthey no longer have jobs or food.\r\nThis is not a local problem; it is global in its scope \r\nand therefore needs greater global action. We do what \r\nwe can at the local level. We in Papua New Guinea have \r\nestablished an integrated national oceans policy and a \r\nsupporting office to ensure a more coherent national \r\napproach to oceans governance. Our commitment to \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n14/25 17-29801\r\nSDG 14 is undiminished, as was demonstrated by our \r\nsupport for the call-for-action outcome document and \r\nthe voluntary commitments that we have all pledged. \r\nWe are pleased with the historic outcome of the first-\r\never United Nations Ocean Conference held four \r\nmonths ago in the General Assembly to support the \r\nimplementation of SDG 14. We welcome and support \r\nthe offer from Kenya and Portugal to be the next hosts \r\nof the United Nations Ocean Conference.\r\nAnother major problem and challenge that we face \r\nin the world today is the dislocation of people from \r\ntheir homes and communities. Indeed, we are facing \r\na refugee crisis in the world today. People are being \r\npushed out of their homes as a result of war, natural \r\ndisasters and the loss of livelihood. This is the plight \r\nof millions of people in developing countries who face \r\ndismal futures if in fact they succeed in surviving \r\nat all. The responsibility for accommodating these \r\nrefugees — people who through no fault of their own \r\nare forced to f lee — lies with the countries whose \r\nactions that led to their displacement.\r\nToday, we live in a globalizing world, but the \r\nprivilege to travel freely is held by only a lucky few \r\nwho have been born principally in developed and \r\nindustrialized countries. We need a more sensible \r\nand humane approach to achieving mobility for all \r\nour people. We have only one planet, we all share that \r\nplanet, and the people of that planet should be free to \r\ntravel and settle when their home has been taken away \r\nfrom them.\r\nWe talk about greater freedoms for our people. We \r\ntalk about freedom of speech, democracy, transparency, \r\ngood governance and human rights, but talk is cheap. \r\nAll too often, the concept of human rights is a mere \r\ntheme of convenience. We need to make the migration \r\nprocess less complicated and more humane.\r\nPapua New Guinea fully supports reform at the \r\nUnited Nations. The United Nations must be fit for \r\npurpose. It must keep pace with the environment in \r\na rapidly changing world. There is broad agreement \r\non the importance of United Nations reform, but the \r\nmain challenge before us is how we are going to go \r\nabout delivering it. We are heartened by the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s passion and call for decisive and swift action \r\non his reform agenda, including in terms of ensuring \r\ngender parity at the top levels of the Secretariat. He has \r\nour undivided support.\r\nWith respect to the Security Council reform \r\nprocess, it must advance the core interests of the vast \r\nmajority of the States Members of the United Nations \r\nso as to make the Council more broadly representative, \r\ntransparent, accountable, effective and efficient. Given \r\nits critical mandate, the Security Council needs to be \r\nmore efficient in its response to contemporary global \r\nchallenges and circumstances.\r\nIn conclusion, the opportunities that lie before the \r\nglobal community are great, but they are also extremely \r\nchallenging, particularly for countries with developing \r\neconomies, such as Papua New Guinea. Regardless \r\nof where we come from, however, we must do more. \r\nAll nations — large or small, rich or poor, weak or \r\nstrong — must strengthen their resolve and work \r\ntogether. I thank all Member States for the achievements \r\nthat we continue to make through the United Nations, \r\nand I pledge that Papua New Guinea will continue to \r\nwork with them to achieve much more.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister of the \r\nIndependent State of Papua New Guinea for the \r\nstatement he has just made.\r\nMr. Peter Paire O’Neill, Prime Minister of Papua \r\nNew Guinea, was escorted from the rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now \r\ncall on His Excellency Mr. Walid Al-Moualem, Deputy \r\nPrime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nExpatriates of the Syrian Arab Republic.\r\nMr. Al-Moualem (Syrian Arab Republic) (spoke \r\nin Arabic): I would like to begin by congratulating \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session \r\nand wish him every success. I would also like to thank \r\nhis predecessor for the important role he played at the \r\nhelm of the General Assembly during the seventy-first \r\nsession. I congratulate Mr. António Guterres on his \r\nappointment as Secretary-General and wish him all the \r\nbest in carrying out his responsibilities in service of \r\nthe purposes and principles of the United Nations as set \r\nforth in the Charter.\r\nAs we meet again, our world is facing challenges \r\nand dangers that are mounting on a daily basis. There is \r\na persistent stand-off between two sets of forces — one \r\nthat strives to control and dominate nations and their \r\nriches by seeking to turn back the clock, re-establish \r\na unipolar world order, fuel chaos and war and \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 15/25\r\nviolate international humanitarian law, and one \r\nthat, in opposition, is working tirelessly to create a \r\nmore balanced, secure and just world, respecting the \r\nsovereignty of States and the right of peoples to exercise \r\nself-determination and build their own future.\r\nAs we meet again, many people continue to pay \r\ndearly with their lives, losing the security, stability and \r\nlivelihoods they once had, as a result of policies forced \r\nupon them by certain countries. These countries falsely \r\nbelieve that they can use terrorism as a tool to satisfy \r\ntheir greed and further ill-conceived agendas that do \r\nnot serve the interests of any people, let alone their own.\r\nNo people have suffered as greatly at the hands of \r\nterrorism as the Syrian people, who, for six years now, \r\nhave fought against terrorism pouring in from all over \r\nthe world, with the support of parties from across the \r\nregion and beyond. For more than six years, Syrians \r\nhave endured the worst conditions and made the greatest \r\nsacrifices in order to defend their country in a terrorist \r\nwar of unprecedented brutality that has spared nothing \r\nand no one. It has targeted innocent people, services, \r\ninfrastructure and cultural heritage, and yet Syria is \r\nmore determined than ever to eradicate terrorism from \r\nevery part of the country without exception, relying on \r\nthe self less sacrifices of our army and the dedication of \r\nour people.\r\nSince the beginning of the war, our State policy \r\nhas followed two main tracks: combating terrorism and \r\nworking towards a political solution that will end the \r\nbloodshed and restore stability. On the counter-terrorism \r\nfront, the Syrian Arab Army, along with its supporting \r\nforces and allies, is making daily achievements in \r\nclearing out terrorist-occupied territories and removing \r\nthe terrorists themselves. Nevertheless, the threat of this \r\nplague persists as terrorists claim the lives of Syrians \r\non a daily basis and deplete the country’s resources.\r\nWe must all understand that terrorism and the \r\nunderlying extremist takfiri ideology will continue to \r\nspread like a tumour throughout the world and haunt \r\nour peoples unless every one of us demonstrates a \r\ngenuine will to cooperate and confront it together. Any \r\nsuch endeavour must respect the sovereignty of States \r\nand the interests of the people, and it must set aside the \r\nillusion that terrorism can be used as a tool for political \r\ngains and narrow interests.\r\nOn the political front, since the early months of \r\nthe crisis the Syrian Government has spared no effort \r\nto stop the bloodshed. The success of reconciliation at \r\nthe local level would not have been possible without \r\nthe leadership, political support and numerous amnesty \r\ndecrees issued by President Bashar Al-Assad, which \r\nallowed everyone who had taken up arms to lay them \r\ndown and resume their normal lives. These successful \r\nacts of reconciliation have allowed tens of thousands \r\nof internally displaced persons and refugees to return \r\nhome and helped to improve the living conditions of \r\na great number of Syrians who had fallen victim to \r\nterrorist crimes.\r\nSyria is determined to scale up its reconciliation \r\nefforts wherever possible, as this is the best way to \r\nalleviate the suffering of Syrians and restore stability \r\nand normality. Since the very first day, the Syrian \r\nGovernment has considered all initiatives to put an \r\nend to the war with an open mind. However, all these \r\ninitiatives eventually failed because States sponsoring \r\nterrorism persisted in their decision to pursue aggressive \r\npolicies against Syria and its people.\r\nWith regard to the Astana and Geneva tracks, \r\nthe Syrian Government has shown how serious \r\nand committed it is by doing its best to provide the \r\nconditions necessary for these efforts to succeed and \r\nfor their goals to be achieved. We are encouraged by the \r\nAstana process and the resulting de-escalation zones, \r\nand we hope that it will help us to achieve an actual \r\ncessation of hostilities and separate terrorist groups \r\nsuch as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), \r\nJabhat al-Nusrah and others from the groups that have \r\nagreed to join the process. This will be the real test \r\nof how committed and serious these groups and their \r\nTurkish sponsors are.\r\nSo far, under President Erdoğan, Turkey has \r\ncontinued to pursue its aggressive policies against \r\nthe Syrian people and laboured under the illusion that \r\nterrorism will help serve its subversive agendas in Syria \r\nand other countries of the region. Turkey’s position \r\nstands in stark contrast to the positive and constructive \r\nrole played by Russia and Iran. Notwithstanding its \r\ncommitment to the memorandum on the creation of \r\nde-escalation areas in the Syrian Arab Republic, Syria \r\nreserves the right to respond to any violation by other \r\nparties. Syria also stresses that the de-escalation zones \r\nare a temporary arrangement that must not violate the \r\nterritorial unity of Syria.\r\nThe Syrian Government reaffirms its commitment \r\nto the Geneva process and to making further progress \r\non this track. In the absence of a genuine national \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n16/25 17-29801\r\nopposition that could be a partner in Syria’s future \r\nand as countries with influence over the other parties \r\ncontinue to block meaningful progress, this process has \r\nyet to bear fruit. It is truly unfortunate that among the \r\ncountries blocking a solution in Syria are members of \r\nthis international Organization and even permanent \r\nmembers of the Security Council.\r\nThe Syrian Government has always insisted \r\nthat any solution in Syria must respect the country’s \r\nnon-negotiable principles, its red line for all Syrians. \r\nThese principles include the complete rejection of \r\nterrorism, the unity of the territory and the people of \r\nSyria, and the rejection of any outside interference \r\nin political decisions involving Syria’s future. Only \r\nSyrians have the right to make such decisions, whether \r\nnow or in future. Absolutely no one can deprive the \r\nfree Syrian people of their will to build the future of \r\ntheir country.\r\nFor decades, Israel has continued its unscrupulous, \r\nthuggish actions with full impunity. This usurper \r\nentity has occupied Arab territories in Palestine and \r\nthe Golan for more than 70 years and has committed \r\nhorrific crimes against innocent civilians. Israel \r\nhas not stopped there; it has publicly interfered in \r\nthe Syrian crisis since its earliest days, providing all \r\nforms of support, including funds, weapons, materiel \r\nand communications equipment, to the most visible \r\nterrorist gangs. Israel has also bombed Syrian army \r\npositions in service to terrorist agendas. Coordination \r\nbetween the Israel and the terrorists was at its highest \r\npoint when terrorist groups decided to target Syrian \r\nair-defence assets that are used to defend Syria against \r\nIsraeli aggression.\r\nThe unlimited Israeli support provided to terrorists \r\nin Syria does not come as a surprise. After all, they share \r\nthe same interests and goals. Let me be clear, however: \r\nit is delusional to believe even for a moment that the \r\ncrisis in Syria will make us forget our inalienable right \r\nto fully recover the occupied Syrian Golan to the lines \r\nof 4 June 1967.\r\nFor more than six years, the States and parties \r\nthat were behind the war in Syria have continued to \r\npeddle lies and falsely accuse the Syrian Government \r\nof using chemical weapons despite the Organization \r\nfor the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons confirmation \r\nthat Syria has fully eliminated its chemical programme. \r\nThis is proof enough of an ill-conceived intention to \r\ntarnish the true image of the Syrian Government in the \r\neyes of the international public and to come up with new \r\nexcuses for continued aggression against Syria, which \r\nnaturally favours the terrorists and their supporters. \r\nSo it was when the United States blatantly attacked the \r\nShayrat air base, claiming that it contained chemical \r\nweapons used in the alleged Khan Shaykhun attack. \r\nAnd, as we have done with regard to every accusation \r\nof this kind, we confirm our readiness to receive and \r\ncooperate with United Nations investigation teams.\r\nCertain countries have boasted about fighting \r\nterrorism in Syria and having the interests of Syrians \r\nat heart. They have established coalitions and held \r\ndozens of conferences under deceptive titles, such as \r\nthe Group of Friends of the Syrian People. It is quite \r\nironic that these same countries are shedding the blood \r\nof thousands of Syrians through their support for \r\nterrorists, bombing innocent civilians and destroying \r\ntheir livelihoods. The so-called Global Coalition \r\nagainst Da’esh, created three years ago, allegedly to \r\nfight terrorist groups such as ISIL, and led by the United \r\nStates, has killed many more innocent Syrians, mostly \r\nwomen and children, than terrorists, and has destroyed \r\nvital infrastructure that Syrians had worked for years \r\nto build. It has also f lagrantly used phosphorus bombs \r\nand other internationally prohibited weapons for all the \r\nworld to see.\r\nWe cannot understand the silence of the international \r\ncommunity in the face of these crimes. The international \r\ncommunity has not condemned or sought to stop \r\nthese crimes even though the Syrian Government has \r\nrepeatedly appealed to the Security Council to assume \r\nits main responsibility of maintaining international \r\npeace and security. The Syrian Government has \r\nurged the Council to implement its own resolutions on \r\ncounter-terrorism, in particular resolution 2253 (2015), \r\nand prevent the Global Coalition from committing even \r\nmore crimes against the citizens of my country.\r\nWhile the Global Coalition has failed to make any \r\nmeaningful progress against the terrorist group ISIL, \r\nthe Syrian army, together with its allies and friends, has \r\nbeen able to secure real and significant gains and drive \r\nterrorists out of large parts of the Syrian desert. In what \r\nwas considered a strategic achievement, the Army was \r\nrecently able to break the siege inflicted by ISIL on the \r\ncity of Deir ez-Zor and its people more than three years \r\nago. This achievement will significantly improve the \r\nhumanitarian situation in the city and contribute to the \r\nfight against terrorism in general.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 17/25\r\nWe have declared more than once that it is \r\nimpossible to fight terrorism without coordinating with \r\nthe Syrian Government. It is the only way to make real \r\ngains in the war on terrorism. Any presence of foreign \r\ntroops on Syrian territory without the consent of the \r\nGovernment is considered a form of occupation, wanton \r\naggression and a f lagrant violation of international law \r\nand the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nThe war that the most powerful countries and \r\nterrorist groups are waging against Syria is not \r\njust a military war. It has taken other forms, no less \r\nbrutal or aggressive, in order to break the will of the \r\nSyrian people and punish them for their firm support \r\nof the Army as it strives to defend Syria’s political \r\nindependence and territorial unity. That is why those \r\ncountries have imposed a stif ling economic blockade \r\nagainst Syria in blatant violation of international law, \r\nwith a view to destroying the livelihoods of Syrians and \r\nincreasing their suffering. These unilateral, coercive \r\nmeasures have been thrust upon vital sectors, most \r\nnotably health-care services. Syria used to have an \r\nadvanced health-care system. However, today, Syrians \r\nare denied access to many types of medicine, even \r\nthose needed to treat life-threatening conditions, such \r\nas cancer. Sanctions such as these are a clear sign of \r\ncertain countries’ hypocrisy as they shed tears over \r\nthe suffering of Syrians while in fact practicing a more \r\nsurreptitious form of terrorism.\r\nThe refugee problem is one of the consequences \r\nof terrorism. As Syria will need the efforts of every \r\nSyrian in the near future, the Syrian Government has \r\nmade their return to their homes a top priority. To this \r\nend, the Syrian Government has embarked on a mission \r\nto liberate and secure areas occupied by terrorists and \r\nimprove the basic living conditions of all Syrians.\r\nGiven that the United Nations has failed to uphold \r\nits own Charter and the principles of international law, \r\nall of us must consider reforming the Organization so \r\nthat it can play its role effectively and defend legitimate \r\nrights from the law of the jungle that some are trying \r\nto impose. Our nations are yearning for a safer, more \r\nsecure, stable and prosperous world. That world will \r\nremain a fantasy as long as certain countries maintain \r\nthe belief that they can foment chaos and mayhem and \r\nforce their will upon the world with full impunity.\r\nWith its resolute people, its courageous Army and \r\nthe support of its loyal allies, my country is steadily \r\nmarching towards the goal of rooting out terrorism. The \r\nliberation of Aleppo and Palmyra, the lifting of the siege \r\nof Deir ez-Zor and the eradication of terrorism from \r\nmany parts of Syria prove that victory is now within \r\nreach. I am confident that, when the unjust war on Syria \r\nis over, the Syrian Army will go down in history as \r\nthe army that heroically defeated — with the help of \r\nsupporting forces and allies — terrorists who came to \r\nSyria from many countries and received broad support \r\nin the form of weapons, funding, training, access and \r\npolitical cover from the most powerful countries in \r\nthe world.\r\nThose terrorists have tried and failed to impose \r\ntheir backward ideology on a peaceful nation that was \r\nonce a cradle of civilization. For generations to come, \r\nhistory books will recount the achievements of the \r\nSyrian people and their dedication as they countered a \r\nbarbaric terrorist campaign and fought unfair measures \r\ndesigned to compound their suffering and deprive \r\nthem of their basic requirements. The Syrian people \r\nhave stood their ground against all odds because they \r\nknow that this war has been waged to eliminate their \r\ncountry and, with it, their very existence. Theirs is an \r\nexample to follow for any people facing — today or in \r\nfuture — similar attempts to break their will and deny \r\nthem their freedom and sovereignty.\r\nAddress by Mr. Roosevelt Skerrit, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Finance and Public \r\nService of the Commonwealth of Dominica\r\nThe Acting President: The Assembly will now \r\nhear an address by the Prime Minister and Minister \r\nfor Finance and Public Service of the Commonwealth \r\nof Dominica.\r\nMr. Roosevelt Skerrit, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance and Public Service of the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted to the \r\nrostrum\r\nThe Acting President: I have great pleasure in \r\nwelcoming His Excellency Mr. Roosevelt Skerrit, Prime \r\nMinister and Minister for Finance and Public Service \r\nof the Commonwealth of Dominica, and inviting him to \r\naddress the Assembly.\r\nMr. Skerrit (Dominica): I come to the General \r\nAssembly straight from the front line of the war on \r\nclimate change. With physical and emotional difficulty, \r\nI have left my bleeding nation to be in this Hall today \r\nbecause these are the moments for which the United \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n18/25 17-29801\r\nNations exists. It is why we have always collectively \r\nrespected and held dear the values of this Organization.\r\nWe congratulate the President on his election and \r\nwish him well in upholding the ideals of humankind’s \r\ngreatest invention. In keeping with the Organization’s \r\nregard for fraternity, we take this opportunity to \r\nexpress our condolences to our brothers and sisters in \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Cuba, Saint Martin, \r\nSaint Thomas, the British Virgin Islands, the Turks \r\nand Caicos Islands, Puerto Rico and the Dominican \r\nRepublic, as well as to those who have suffered losses \r\nin the host country, the United States, in Texas and \r\nFlorida. For our brothers and sisters in Mexico, we \r\nstand in prayerful solidarity following the catastrophic \r\nearthquake this past week.\r\nWarmer air and sea temperatures have permanently \r\naltered the climate between the tropics of Cancer \r\nand Capricorn. Heat is the fuel that takes ordinary \r\nstorms that we could normally master in our sleep \r\nand supercharges them into a devastating force. In the \r\npast, we would prepare for a single heavy storm per \r\nyear. Now thousands of storms form on a breeze in the \r\nmid-Atlantic and line up to pound us with maximum \r\nforce and fury.\r\nPrior to this century, no other generation had seen \r\nmore than one category 5 hurricane in its lifetime. This \r\ncentury, it has already happened twice and, notably, \r\nthese two events occurred in the space of the last two \r\nweeks. I should add that we are only midway into this \r\nyear’s hurricane season. In the case of Dominica, it had \r\nbeen only two years since we lost lives and endured \r\nsubstantial physical and infrastructural damage from \r\nthe ravages of the f loods and mudslides caused by \r\nTropical Storm Erika.\r\nTo deny climate change is to procrastinate while \r\nthe Earth founders. It is to deny a truth that we have \r\njust lived. It is to mock the thousands of my compatriots \r\nwho in a few hours will watch the night descend upon \r\nDominica without a roof over their heads, in fear of \r\nsudden mudslides or whatever else the next hurricane \r\nmight bring. We as a country and a region did not start \r\nthis war against nature. We did not provoke it. But the \r\nwar has come to us.\r\nThere is no more time for conversation. There is \r\nlittle time left for action. While the big countries talk, \r\nthe small island nations suffer. We need action and \r\nwe need it now. We in the Caribbean do not produce \r\ngreenhouse gases or sulphate aerosols. We do not pollute \r\nor overfish our oceans. We have made no contribution \r\nto global warming that can move the needle, yet we are \r\namong the main victims on the front line.\r\nWe in the Commonwealth of Dominica have long \r\npursued and respected an existence that preserves our \r\nlittle Eden. The Morne Trois Pitons has been a national \r\npark for 40 years and a UNESCO World Heritage Site \r\nfor 20. Our livelihoods are part of our ecosystem. That \r\nis how my people and my country earn and survive. \r\nBut what is our reality at this moment? It is pure \r\ndevastation, as Dominicans bear the brunt of climate \r\nchange. I repeat — we are shouldering the consequences \r\nof the actions of others, actions that endanger our very \r\nexistence and all for the enrichment of a few elsewhere.\r\nWe dug graves today in Dominica. We buried \r\nloved ones yesterday, and I am sure that when I return \r\nhome tomorrow, we will discover additional fatalities \r\nas a consequence of this encounter. Our homes are \r\nf lattened, our buildings roofless, our water pipes \r\nsmashed and our road infrastructure destroyed. Our \r\nhospital is without power and schools have disappeared \r\nbeneath the rubble. Our crops are uprooted. Where \r\nthere was green, there is now only dust and dirt. The \r\ndesolation is beyond imagination. The stars have fallen. \r\nEden is broken.\r\nThe nation of Dominica has come to the General \r\nAssembly to declare an international humanitarian \r\nemergency — one that is centred in Dominica but also \r\nencompasses many of our neighbours, including our \r\nsister isle, Antigua, which had to evacuate its citizens \r\nfrom Barbuda. Dominicans have been responsible \r\nmembers of the global community. We have joined all \r\nof the major international battles, from the abolition \r\nof forced labour to the protection of patents. Yet today \r\n72,000 Dominicans stand on the front line in a war they \r\ndid not choose, with extensive casualties from a war \r\nthey did not start.\r\nThe time has come for the international community \r\nto take a stand and decide whether it will be shoulder \r\nto shoulder with those suffering the ravages of \r\nclimate change worldwide, whether we can mitigate \r\nthe consequences of unprecedented increases in sea \r\ntemperatures and levels, whether it will help us rebuild \r\nsustainable livelihoods or whether it will merely show \r\nsome pity right now and afterwards f lee, relieved to \r\nknow that this time it happened to someone else. Today, \r\nwe, the small nations of the world, need to know who \r\nour real friends are, the people who have our backs. \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 19/25\r\nNot all countries are sitting as inactive bystanders. \r\nSome of our traditional friends are playing their part. \r\nThe United Arab Emirates, for example, has risen to \r\nthe challenge. We commend Sheik Mohammed Al \r\nMaktoum, its Prime Minister, for his announcement, \r\nin this year of Zayed, that his country will boost the \r\ntheme of giving by “delivering even more goodness \r\nto all parts of the world”. Today we invite nations of \r\nsimilar might to follow his lead.\r\nThe success of the twenty-first session of Conference \r\nof the Parties to the United Nations Framework \r\nConvention on Climate Change, held in Paris, was a \r\ndemonstration of the collective political will of Member \r\nStates in taking action to combat climate change. One \r\nyear on, the call to action must be even more urgent \r\nif we are to curtail the impact of climate change on \r\nus and future generations. We need all humankind, \r\nall countries — big and small, developed and \r\ndeveloping — to come together to save our planet. We \r\nmust all live up to our obligations and commitments to \r\ndo more. Inaction, and even inadequate action, destroys \r\nlives. The Green Climate Fund, which was created to \r\nhelp put mitigation measures in place and assist the \r\nvictims of climate change, is commendable, but much \r\nmore must be done to aid the countries that continue to \r\nbear the brunt of the impact of climate change.\r\nThe World Bank established the Caribbean \r\nCatastrophe Risk Insurance Facility to assist countries \r\nthat have been affected by natural disasters. Though \r\nhelpful, the amounts are usually grossly inadequate \r\nto rebuild infrastructure and maintain the gains and \r\nprogress made in economic and social development in \r\nthe wake of the likes of Hurricanes Maria and Irma, \r\nor even in the case of a tropical storm such as Erika, \r\nwhich occurred two years ago. Substantially more \r\nfunds must therefore be made available to vulnerable \r\ncountries for loss and damage so they can mitigate the \r\nrisks associated with future incidents.\r\nThe World Bank Facility must be recapitalized for \r\ngreater coverage by using already committed funds from \r\nthe Green Climate Fund. That will enable our countries \r\nto focus on improving people’s lives and supporting \r\nthe attainment of the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nIt will enable us to rebuild our nation — not as it was, \r\nbut so that it is far more capable of meeting the realities \r\nof rising sea levels and warmer oceans. Not to do so \r\nwould be to abandon those who have paid a steep price \r\nfor what others elsewhere have created. It would be to \r\nlet 72,000 Dominicans shoulder the world’s conscience \r\non climate change on their own.\r\nToday, we ask members not to express their \r\nsympathies this week and then hope that our eyes do not \r\nmeet next week. Let these extraordinary events elicit \r\nextraordinary efforts to rebuild nations sustainably. \r\nLet them unleash the innovation and creativity of \r\nglobal citizens to spark a new paradigm of green \r\neconomic development that stabilizes and reverses the \r\nconsequences of human-induced global warming. Let it \r\nspark a thousand points of light, not shame. Let us take \r\nserious action against the realities of climate change. \r\nI promise that we Dominicans and other Caribbean \r\ncitizens will play our part.\r\nWe are in shock, but we are not bowed. We cry, \r\nbut we do not despair. We will rise because Dominican \r\npeople are strong, because Caribbean people are \r\nresilient. We will rebuild our Garden of Eden again for \r\nour children and for future generations.\r\nAs a result of Tropical Storm Erika in 2015, we \r\ncommitted to creating a national vulnerability risk and \r\nresilience fund to improve our Government’s ability to \r\nrespond to the impact of natural disasters. It has not yet \r\nbeen capitalized. We intended to transfer funds to it from \r\nour own treasury on an annual basis, but our capacity \r\nto earn has now been significantly compromised even \r\nbefore we have gotten it off the ground.\r\nToday we need all the things required after a \r\nnatural disaster that has affected an entire nation. \r\nWe need water, food and emergency shelter. We need \r\nroads, bridges and new infrastructure, but we also need \r\ndelivery capabilities. I call on those with substantial \r\nmilitary capacities to lend us the rescue and rebuilding \r\nequipment that may be standing idle, waiting for a war. \r\nLet Dominica today be that war, because our landscape \r\ncurrently resembles a war zone. The battle we are in \r\nhas brought us to our knees. We need resources now so \r\nthat we can move purposefully towards rebuilding our \r\nbeautiful island home. We will need to rebuild homes \r\nand villages. We will need to rebuild communities, \r\nschools, roads and bridges. We will need to rebuild a \r\ncountry, and we cannot do it alone. Above all else, we \r\nneed the international community. We need its humanity \r\nand we need it now to act truly as our United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: On behalf of the General \r\nAssembly, I wish to thank the Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance and Public Service of the \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n20/25 17-29801\r\nCommonwealth of Dominica for the statement he has \r\njust made.\r\nMr. Roosevelt Skerrit, Prime Minister and \r\nMinister for Finance and Public Service of the \r\nCommonwealth of Dominica, was escorted from \r\nthe rostrum.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Sushma Swaraj, Minister for External Affairs of \r\nthe Republic of India.\r\nMs. Swaraj (India) (spoke in Hindi; English \r\ninterpretation provided by the delegation): Let me \r\nbegin by offering my heartiest congratulations to \r\nForeign Minister Lajčák on assuming the presidency of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. For \r\nthose of us fortunate enough to represent our nations as \r\nForeign Minister, it is a particularly happy event that \r\none of us has this honour.\r\nI addressed the Assembly last year as well (see \r\nA/71/PV.22). This year has seen much change both in \r\nthe Assembly and the world it represents. We have a \r\nnew Secretary-General at the United Nations who \r\nis determined to prepare and strengthen the United \r\nNations to meet the challenges of the twenty-first \r\ncentury. We welcome his efforts and see in him a leader \r\nwho can give practical shape to a vision.\r\nOur world today is trapped in a deluge of troubles \r\nof which the most dangerous is surely the relentless \r\nrise of violence. The evil of terrorism and the ideas \r\nthat provoke it are spreading like wildfire. Climate \r\nchange stares us in the face, and its threat is growing. \r\nMaritime security is an increasing worry. For many \r\ncompelling and terrible reasons, people are leaving the \r\npsychological, cultural and economic comfort of their \r\nhomes to seek refuge on distant shores, giving rise to \r\nglobal anxiety. A large part of the world’s population \r\nstill suffers from hunger and poverty. Young people are \r\nbeginning to lose hope as they confront unemployment. \r\nWomen, historically the victims of discrimination, \r\nare demanding what they should have — gender \r\nempowerment. The danger of nuclear proliferation is \r\nback in the headlines. Cybersecurity has become a \r\nsource of deep insecurity.\r\nIn 2015, we set ourselves the target date of 2030 \r\nfor finding solutions to many of the challenges on our \r\nagenda. Two of those years have already passed. Surely \r\nit is already time to ask how much has happened. If \r\ncomplacency ends up defining the next 13 years, we \r\nwill be in danger of losing control. We need a sense of \r\nurgency, as well as unshakable fortitude, if we are to take \r\nthe decisions that can avert catastrophe. I am pleased \r\nthat India has displayed the courage and leadership \r\nneeded to take such tough decisions and launch its \r\ninterlinked process of sustainable development.\r\nMy Government’s most important priority is the \r\ncomplete eradication of poverty, and there are two \r\nways of addressing that curse. The traditional method \r\nis through incremental levels of aid and hand-holding, \r\nbut our Prime Minister Narendra Modi has chosen the \r\nmore radical route, through economic empowerment. \r\nThe poor are not helpless; we have merely denied them \r\nopportunity. We are eliminating poverty by investing \r\nin the poor. We are turning them from job-seekers into \r\njob-providers. All of our economic programmes have \r\none main purpose — empowering the poor. Jan Dhan, \r\nMudra, Ujjwala, Skill India, Digital India, Clean India, \r\nStart-Up India, Stand-Up India — describing them all \r\nwould take more time than I have at my disposal. I shall \r\ntherefore dwell only on three core programmes.\r\nThe Jan Dhan plan must surely count as the world’s \r\nlargest financial inclusion scheme. Those who had no \r\nmoney were able to open bank accounts with no balance. \r\nNo other country in the world has enabled even those \r\nwith no money to have a bank account and passbook. \r\nThat impossibility has now become possible in India. \r\nAt least 300 million Indians — almost the equivalent \r\nof the population of the United States — who had never \r\ncrossed the threshold of a bank now have bank accounts. \r\nThat was, understandably, not easy to complete in three \r\nyears, but our banks have achieved that visionary goal \r\nset by our Prime Minister. While some have still to be \r\nincluded, the target has been set. Every Indian family \r\nwill have a bank account.\r\nMudra Yojana has enabled the Government to fund \r\nthe unfunded. Today, through Mudra, people who had \r\nnever dreamt that bank credit could be an option for \r\nthem are getting soft loans without collateral to begin \r\nmicro-businesses. I am particularly pleased to be \r\nable to say that 70 per cent of those loans have gone \r\nto women. Unemployment spreads despair. Through \r\nSkill India, Start-Up India and Stand-Up India, poor \r\nand middle-class youth are being trained to match their \r\ntalents with bank credit and become self-employed as \r\nsmall-scale entrepreneurs.\r\nUjjwala is one of the Government’s signature \r\nschemes. Poor women who had to work hard in the \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 21/25\r\nkitchen were sometimes left blinded by the smoke \r\nfrom their stoves. The poor are being provided with \r\nfree gas cylinders so that women do not have to suffer \r\nthe dangerous consequences of wood-fired kitchens. \r\nUniquely, gender emancipation is at the creative core \r\nof that programme.\r\nDemonetization was a courageous decision \r\nto challenge the black money that disappeared \r\nfrom circulation and was one of the by-products of \r\ncorruption. India has now also passed legislation for a \r\ngoods and services tax under which there is one tax \r\nthroughout the country, without the disorganized and \r\npunishing system of multiple taxes under different \r\ncategories in different parts of the country. Our Save \r\nthe Girl, Educate the Girl campaign is reducing gender \r\ninequality. Our Clean India programme is generating \r\nwhat can only be described as a revolutionary change \r\nin social attitudes and habits.\r\nAt this point, I would like to note that nations with \r\nrising capabilities can generate these kinds of change, \r\nbut the developed world must become an active partner \r\nin helping vulnerable countries that are still mired in \r\nstagnant poverty to reach the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals (SDGs) horizon by 2030. That is why the principle \r\nof global partnership was included in the SDGs. I am \r\nhappy to report that this year India has launched an \r\nIndia-United Nations Development Partnership Fund.\r\nRegrettably, while we are fully engaged in fighting \r\npoverty, our neighbour Pakistan seems to be engaged \r\nonly in fighting us. On Thursday, from this rostrum, \r\nPakistan’s Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi \r\nwasted rather too much of his speech (see A/72/PV.14) \r\ncomplaining about us, accusing India of State-sponsored \r\nterrorism and violations of human rights. Those \r\nlistening had only one comment to make — “Look \r\nwho is talking.” The country that has been the world’s \r\ngreatest exporter of havoc, death and inhumanity has \r\nbecome a champion of hypocrisy by preaching about \r\nhumanity and human rights from this rostrum.\r\nPakistan’s Prime Minister claimed that his nation’s \r\nfounder, Muhammad Ali Jinnah, bequeathed a foreign \r\npolicy based on peace and friendship. I would like \r\nto remind him that while it remains open to question \r\nwhether Mr. Jinnah actually advocated such principles, \r\nwhat is beyond doubt is that from the moment India’s \r\nPrime Minister Modi took his oath of office, he \r\nhas extended the hand of peace and friendship, and \r\nPakistan’s Prime Minister must answer why his \r\nnation has spurned that offer. Prime Minister Abbasi \r\nrecalled old decisions that have long been overtaken \r\nby events, but his memory conveniently failed him \r\nwhere it matters. He has forgotten that under the Simla \r\nAgreement and the Lahore Declaration, India and \r\nPakistan resolved to settle all outstanding disputes \r\nand issues bilaterally. The reality is that Pakistan’s \r\npoliticians remember everything but conveniently \r\nmanipulate those memories. They are masters at \r\nforgetting facts that undermine their version of events.\r\nPakistan’s Prime Minister spoke of a comprehensive \r\ndialogue between our two countries. I would like to \r\nremind him that on 9 December 2015, when I was in \r\nIslamabad for the Heart of Asia Ministerial Conference, \r\na decision was made by his leader, Mian Nawaz Sharif, \r\nthen still Prime Minister, to renew dialogue between \r\nus through what he called a comprehensive bilateral \r\ndialogue. The word “bilateral” was used consciously to \r\nremove any confusion or doubt about the fact that the \r\nproposed talks would be between our two nations and \r\nonly our two nations, without any third party present. \r\nMr. Abbasi must answer why that proposal withered, \r\nbecause Pakistan is responsible for aborting that \r\npeace process.\r\nI would just like to ask Pakistan’s politicians why it \r\nis that although India and Pakistan became free within \r\nhours of each other, today India is recognized as an \r\ninformation-technology super-Power and Pakistan only \r\nas a pre-eminent exporter of terrorism? Have they ever \r\nthought about what the reason for that might be?\r\nThere is only one reason for it. India has risen \r\ndespite being the principal destination for Pakistan’s \r\nnefarious export of terrorism. There have been many \r\nGovernments under many parties during the 70 years \r\nof Indian freedom, because India has maintained its \r\ndemocracy. Every Government has done its bit for India’s \r\ndevelopment. We have marched ahead consistently, \r\nwithout pause, creating integrated management \r\nsystems, education and technology services and AIMS \r\nfoundations in education, health, space and the entire \r\nrange of human welfare. We have established scientific \r\nand technical institutions that are the pride of the world.\r\nBut what has Pakistan offered the world or, \r\nindeed, its own people, apart from terrorism? We have \r\nproduced scholars, doctors, engineers and scientists. \r\nIt has produced terrorists and terrorist camps —\r\nLashkar-e-Tayyiba, Jaish-e-Mohammed, Hizbul \r\nMujahideen and the Haqqani Network. What has \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n22/25 17-29801\r\nPakistan created? It has created terrorists and jihadists. \r\nDoctors save people from death; terrorists send them \r\nto their death. Pakistan’s terrorist organizations are not \r\nonly attacking India, they are also affecting two of our \r\nneighbours, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.\r\nIn the history of the General Assembly, it may be \r\na first that a country has asked for a right of reply in \r\norder to respond to the statements of three different \r\ncountries. Does that simple fact not illustrate the \r\nreality of Pakistan’s actions? If Pakistan had spent on \r\ndevelopment what it has spent on developing terror, \r\nboth it and the world would be safer and better off today.\r\nTerrorism is at the very top of the list of problems \r\nto which the United Nations is searching for solutions. \r\nWe are the oldest victim of this terrible, even traumatic \r\nterrorism. When we first began pointing to this \r\nmenace, many of the world’s great Powers dismissed \r\nit as a law-and-order issue. Now they know better. The \r\nquestion is what we do about it. We must all look within \r\nourselves and ask whether the action we are taking even \r\napproaches the level of our talk about it. In bilateral \r\nand multilateral discussions we all condemn this evil \r\nand piously declare our determination to fight it. The \r\ntruth is that these statements have become rituals. The \r\nfact is that when we are required to fight and destroy \r\nthis enemy, the self-interest of some makes them \r\nduplicitous. That has been going on for years.\r\nAlthough India had proposed a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism as early as 1996, \r\ntwo decades later the United Nations has not been \r\nable to agree on a definition of terrorism. If we cannot \r\nagree on a definition of our enemy, how can we fight \r\ntogether? If we continue to differentiate between good \r\nterrorists and bad, how can we fight together? If even \r\nthe Security Council cannot agree on the listing of \r\nterrorists, how can we fight together?\r\nIn all sincerity, I would like to ask the Assembly, \r\nthrough you, Madam, to stop seeing this evil with self-\r\ndefeating, indeed meaningless nuance. Evil is evil. \r\nLet us accept that terrorism is an existential danger to \r\nhumankind. There is absolutely no justification for such \r\nbarbaric violence. Let us display our new commitment \r\nby reaching an agreement on a comprehensive \r\nconvention on international terrorism this year.\r\nI have identified climate change as one of the \r\nsignificant dangers to our existence. India has already \r\nsaid that it is deeply committed to the Paris Climate \r\nChange Agreement. That is not because we are afraid \r\nof any Power, influenced by friend or foe or tempted by \r\nsome imagined greed. It is an outcome of a philosophy \r\nthat is at least 5,000 years old. Our Prime Minister has, \r\non his personal initiative, launched the International \r\nSolar Alliance as witness to our abiding commitment \r\nto this cause.\r\nWhen we talk of world peace, we mean peace not \r\nonly among human beings but also with nature. We \r\nunderstand that human nature is sometimes inimical to \r\nnature, but we would like to amend human nature when \r\nit tends in the wrong directions. When we inflict our \r\ngreed on nature, nature sometimes explodes. We must \r\nlearn to live with the imperatives, cycles and creative \r\nurges of nature. In that lies our own salvation.\r\nWe have just witnessed hurricanes and earthquakes, \r\nrains that inundate and storms that terrify. That is not \r\nmere coincidence. Through Hurricane Harvey, Nature \r\nsent its warning to the world even before the world’s \r\nleaders gathered at the United Nations in New York. \r\nAfter our gathering had already begun, an earthquake \r\nstruck Mexico and a hurricane landed in Dominica. \r\nWe must understand that this requires more serious \r\naction, not more talk. The countries of the developed \r\nworld must listen more carefully than others, because \r\nthey have more capacities than others. The developed \r\nworld must help the less fortunate through technology \r\ntransfer and Green Climate Fund financing. That is the \r\nonly way to safeguard future generations.\r\nWe have been discussing turmoil and change around \r\nthe world, but the one Organization created to address \r\nworld affairs is beset by its own problems. It seems to \r\nbelieve that there is no need for it to make changes in the \r\nprecepts and perceptions that brought about its birth. \r\nOn 18 September, I participated in a meeting in New \r\nYork on United Nations reform and witnessed a clear \r\ndesire for change and action. But I should also remind \r\nthe Assembly that at the 2005 World Summit there was \r\na consensus that reforming the Security Council as \r\nsoon as possible was an essential element of our overall \r\neffort to reform the United Nations. Efforts to conduct \r\ntext-based negotiations on reforming and expanding \r\nthe Security Council were initiated during last year’s \r\nsession, and more than 160 nations expressed support \r\nfor them. If we are serious, the least we can do is to \r\nproduce one text that can be the basis for negotiation. I \r\nhope that under the enlightened leadership of the new \r\nPresident of the General Assembly this will become a \r\npriority. If it does, that will be a significant achievement.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 23/25\r\nWe also have high expectations of the new Secretary-\r\nGeneral. If he wants to reform the Organization’s peace \r\nand security architecture, he will also have to address \r\nthe reforms related to United Nations peacekeeping that \r\nhave long been demanded. Without such improvements, \r\nit will be impossible for him to achieve that goal.\r\nThere is no shortage of issues and problems that \r\nshould be acknowledged from this rostrum. But time \r\nis not always on the side of those who would like to \r\nraise issues and problems in the interests of a better, \r\nmore peaceful and progressive future. The issues that \r\nthe President of the General Assembly has chosen are \r\nrelevant to the Charter of the United Nations as well \r\nas to the ancient traditions of my land. My country’s \r\nculture and thought have been shaped by a history \r\nand philosophy that believes in peace as humankind’s \r\nonly rational and practical objective. We truly believe \r\nthat the world is one family, and we hope that every \r\nmember of this family deserves that elixir of life that \r\nis happiness.\r\nLet me end by reciting a verse that is a synthesis of \r\nour thought: “May all be happy; may all be healthy; may \r\nall see what is good; may all be free from suffering”.\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in French): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Mahmoud Ali Youssouf, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of \r\nthe Republic of Djibouti.\r\nMr. Youssouf (Djibouti) (spoke in French): At \r\nthe outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. I would like \r\nto take this opportunity to express the hope that under \r\nhis leadership, the General Assembly will achieve \r\nits objectives and to assure him of my country’s full \r\nsupport for his efforts.\r\nI would also like to pay tribute to Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\nwho preceded Mr. Lajčák in his position, and to reiterate \r\nour warm congratulations to Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres on his well-deserved appointment. \r\nWe wish him every success as he discharges the lofty \r\nmandate that has been entrusted to him.\r\nNotwithstanding its major progress and new \r\nopportunities, the world continues to face many \r\nchallenges. The economic and financial situation \r\nremains a source of concern, and the security front \r\nis equally worrying. New threats are emerging. The \r\nnature of conflict is changing. A number of crises \r\nare worsening and growing ever more complex. Even \r\nif climate change sometimes gives rise to scientific \r\ncontroversy, today it is an undeniable reality that is \r\nproducing one major catastrophe after another. I would \r\nlike to take this opportunity to convey our sympathy \r\nand solidarity with the communities that have been \r\nrecently affected in the United States, Mexico and \r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nAll of these challenges underscore the crucial \r\nimportance of sustained and resolute collective action \r\nto address them. We must mobilize once more to \r\nrevitalize multilateralism and stress the central role to \r\nbe played in it the United Nations. The task is enormous \r\nand the responsibility heavy. Such challenges require \r\nambitious reforms and increased resources. The \r\nreform undertaken by the Secretary-General in three \r\nkey areas — the repositioning of the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system in the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, management \r\nreform, and the reform of the peace and security \r\narchitecture — is a timely response to the need to make \r\nthe Organization a tool that can more effectively realize \r\nits full potential for serving the people it was created \r\nto serve.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda is an ambitious programme both \r\nfor the eradication of poverty and the preservation \r\nof the planet. In addition, the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change, the Sendai Declaration and the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Agenda represent an array of tools \r\nfor strengthening the 2030 Agenda. It also calls on \r\ncountries to adopt policy frameworks in order to change \r\ntheir modes of production and consumption, as well as \r\nstrategies to address climate change and disaster risk. \r\nWith regard to the full and effective implementation of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Djibouti \r\nwould like to make a few comments.\r\nFirst, Africa and the least developed countries \r\nshould be treated as a priority. As the United Nations \r\nConference on Trade and Development has pointed out \r\nin its analyses,\r\n(spoke in English)\r\n“[Africa is] the battleground where [the \r\nSustainable Development Goals] will be won \r\nor lost”.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nWe must also mobilize large amounts of financing \r\nif we are to match these ambitions. To do that, we must \r\nA/72/PV.19 23/09/2017\r\n24/25 17-29801\r\nadopt innovative financing mechanisms that not only \r\nguarantee increased foreign direct investment but also \r\nensure that development aid commitments are kept. The \r\nnecessity of that can be demonstrated by careful study of \r\nthe pledges for financing the Millennium Development \r\nGoals, which were not fully honoured, and by the fact \r\nthat the goal of 0.7 per cent as a portion of gross national \r\nincome established for official development assistance \r\nhas not been regularly paid. If it had, by now we would \r\nhave mobilized $2.5 trillion. We should also emphasize \r\nthe importance of an international trade system focused \r\non the three Ps, that is,\r\n(spoke in English)\r\npoor-people-centred, productivity-enhancing and \r\nplanet-friendly.\r\n(spoke in French)\r\nLastly, we cannot stress strongly enough the \r\nimportance of evaluation tools that make it possible to \r\nreliably measure progress. Through strong partnership \r\nand sustained effort, we can and must work to promote \r\neconomic growth that is mindful of social justice and \r\nrespects the environment.\r\nThe absence of peace is the major obstacle to \r\neconomic development. The human cost of conflict \r\nis enormous and brings with it massive forced \r\ndisplacement, famine, the spread of communicable \r\ndiseases, acute food insecurity and a rapid deterioration \r\nin respect for human rights. Now more than ever, our \r\nOrganization has an increased role to play in conflict \r\nprevention and the peaceful settlement of disputes. \r\nIn that regard, we welcome the Secretary-General’s \r\nemphasis on such prevention and the reforms under \r\nway to restructure the peace and security architecture.\r\nThe emergence of extremist terrorist groups \r\nperpetrating acts of unprecedented violence poses \r\na new challenge. By disseminating an ideology of \r\nintolerance and hatred that calls explicitly for the \r\nannihilation of others, they undermine the cohesion of \r\nour societies and pose a threat to international peace \r\nand security that demands that we coordinate our \r\nefforts to combat terrorism.\r\nDjibouti welcomed the recent establishment of the \r\nOffice of Counter-Terrorism for coordinating United \r\nNations action in the fight against terrorism and violent \r\nextremism. Djibouti also hosts the Centre of Excellence \r\nfor Preventing and Countering Violent Extremism \r\nof the Intergovernmental Authority on Development \r\n(IGAD), designed as a common platform for supporting \r\nthe strengthening of national and regional coordination, \r\nproducing analysis and ultimately formulating an action \r\nplan aimed at countering extremist rhetoric conveyed \r\nthrough social media.\r\nI would now like to express our views on certain \r\nregional and international situations that are high on \r\nthe agenda for States Members of the United Nations.\r\nRegarding Somalia, Djibouti welcomes the \r\nrecent political developments in the country and the \r\nmomentum created by the election in February of \r\nPresident Mohamed Abdullahi Mohamed Farmajo and \r\nthe formation of a new Government. We welcome the \r\nmany encouraging steps taken to strengthen relations \r\nwith Somalia’s federal member states and the strategy \r\nthat has been implemented to promote tax and economic \r\nreforms aimed at mobilizing domestic resources. \r\nHowever, we stress the importance of increasing support \r\nto Somalia by mobilizing adequate funding in support \r\nof its development programme. We remain concerned \r\nabout the proposed cuts in funding to the African Union \r\nMission in Somalia (AMISOM), despite the consensus \r\non that African peacekeeping operation’s success. \r\nCare must be taken to ensure that the improvements \r\nin the security situation are maintained. AMISOM has \r\nbrought the Al-Shabaab terrorists to their knees in a \r\nbloody defeat.\r\nWith regard to South Sudan, we remain concerned \r\nby the slow implementation of the August 2015 \r\nAgreement on the Resolution of the Conflict in the \r\nRepublic of South Sudan. The actors involved in that \r\nprotracted crisis must acknowledge that there can be \r\nno military solution to the conflict. In that regard, we \r\nsupport the decision of the thirty-first Extraordinary \r\nSummit of IGAD Heads of State and Government on \r\nthe situation in South Sudan, and reiterate the need for \r\na genuine, transparent and credibly inclusive national \r\ndialogue to enable lasting peace to be restored. We \r\nalso underline the important role played by the United \r\nNations Mission in South Sudan in the quest for a \r\nsolution to the crisis there and urge all stakeholders \r\nto continue their efforts to implement their mandates, \r\nwhile recognizing the importance of complementary \r\nand coordinated action.\r\nTurning to Yemen, Djibouti continues to be \r\nextremely concerned by the triple tragedy the country \r\nis experiencing, as United Nations officials have \r\nemphasized in the Security Council — famine, an \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.19\r\n17-29801 25/25\r\nunprecedented cholera epidemic and a serious political \r\nimpasse hindering progress towards peace and security. \r\nWe urge all parties to return to the negotiating table.\r\nIn Palestine, we all know that only a two-State \r\nsolution can bring peace to the region. The suffering \r\nof the Palestinian people has lasted for too long and \r\nmust end.\r\nDjibouti is also troubled by the fate of the Muslim \r\nRohingya minority in Rakhine state in Myanmar. We \r\nare gravely concerned about the military brutality \r\ntargeting civilian populations and the atrocities that we \r\nhave all seen in the press. Despite the Government’s \r\nassurances, the crimes against the Rohingya community \r\nhave not abated. We support the conclusions of the final \r\nreport of the Advisory Commission on Rakhine State, \r\nled by former Secretary-General Kofi Annan, and call \r\non Myanmar to fully implement its recommendations \r\nwithout further delay.\r\nDjibouti remains alarmed by North Korea’s \r\nbelligerent and dangerously provocative attitude. \r\nIts multiple ballistic-missile launch tests violate the \r\nprovisions of the relevant Security Council resolutions. \r\nMember States should monitor the situation vigilantly. \r\nWe call on North Korea to engage in a constructive and \r\nresult-oriented dialogue to find a satisfactory solution \r\nto the crisis.\r\nDjibouti is still awaiting the return of the 13 \r\nmembers of its military who have been detained by \r\nEritrea, a neighbour of ours whose belligerent policies \r\ntowards my country continue. We call on Eritrea to \r\naccept the mediation efforts of the African Union in \r\norder to demarcate its Ras Doumeira and Doumeira \r\nIsland borders, begin to build trustworthy relationships \r\nwith its neighbours and cease the hostile policies that \r\nare destabilizing the entire Horn of Africa.\r\nI wish the General Assembly every success in \r\nits work.\r\nThe meeting rose at 11.55 a.m.\r\n"
