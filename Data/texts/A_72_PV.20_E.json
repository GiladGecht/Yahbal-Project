"United Nations A/72/PV.20\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n20th plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 23 September 2017, noon \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mrs. Nusseibeh \r\n(United Arab Emirates), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at noon.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President (spoke in Arabic): I now call \r\non His Excellency Mr. Adel Ahmed Al-Jubeir, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.\r\nMr. Al-Jubeir (Saudi Arabia) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, I would like to congratulate Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on his election to the presidency of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session and to wish \r\nhim every success. I would also like to thank Mr. Peter \r\nThomson, President of the Assembly at its seventy-first \r\nsession, for his efforts throughout his tenure.\r\nI am very pleased to be addressing the Assembly \r\ntoday as my country celebrates its national holiday. We \r\nlook to the past with pride and are working ambitiously \r\ntowards the future. Today, I am the messenger of a \r\nState that has made its people its top priority and \r\nresolutely set forth on a path to sustainable development \r\nthrough creating opportunities, thanks to its fruitful \r\npartnerships with friends around the world. Under the \r\nleadership of our King, we are helping to establish \r\npeace and security in the region and around the world.\r\nThe Israeli-Palestinian conflict is the most \r\nprotracted dispute in the modern history of our region \r\nand has led to innumerable tragedies and endless \r\nhuman suffering. Nothing can justify its continuation, \r\nespecially when there is an international consensus \r\non the importance of reaching a two-State solution, \r\nbased on internationally recognized resolutions and the \r\nArab Peace Initiative, with the goal of establishing an \r\nindependent Palestinian State, with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital, within the pre-1967 borders. More than ever \r\nwe need concerted international determination to make \r\nthat solution a reality.\r\nWe have been tackling the Houthi-Saleh insurgency \r\nin Yemen as a coalition in order to help the legitimate \r\nGovernment of Yemen save its people and restore its \r\nState in line with the purposes and principles of the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. That was not a choice \r\nfor us in Yemen. We resorted to it only after sustained \r\npolitical efforts to maintain Yemen’s safety and stability \r\nand preserve its territorial integrity and independence. \r\nWe therefore affirm our full support for the political \r\nprocess in Yemen and will stand by the United Nations \r\nand its Special Envoy in their efforts to arrive at a political \r\nsolution in line with Security Council resolution 2216 \r\n(2015) and the Gulf Cooperation Council initiative, and \r\nthrough national dialogue. We are aware of the extent \r\nof the humanitarian suffering of our brothers in Yemen \r\nsince the coup d’état and have spared no effort to come \r\nto their aid. In fact, the assistance provided by the \r\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia in recent years now amounts \r\nto more than $8 billion for every area of humanitarian \r\nmedical and development needs, funnelled through the \r\nKing Salman Humanitarian Aid and Relief Centre.\r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It is a \r\nhuman tragedy that demands an urgent response and \r\nshould end immediately, in line with the principles on \r\nwhich our Organization was founded. As we urge the \r\nGovernment of Myanmar to honour its obligations and \r\nprotect its peoples from discrimination, we continue to \r\nprovide humanitarian assistance to the Rohingya. King \r\nSalman has provided $15 million to help the displaced, \r\nin addition to my country’s provision of assistance by \r\ntaking in more than half a million Rohingya refugees. \r\nHis Majesty has also personally intervened with \r\nneighbouring States and has been working with the \r\nGovernment of Bangladesh to ensure safe passage for \r\nthe refugees and decent living conditions for them in \r\nthe various host countries.\r\nToday our international community is facing one of \r\nthe greatest ever challenges to its security and stability, \r\nthe threat of terrorism, which is striking all over the \r\nworld, in defiance of all human rights and values. My \r\ncountry will continue to work steadfastly to counter \r\nextremism and terrorism in all their manifestations. The \r\nArab-Islamic-American summit was held in Riyadh in \r\nMay with that purpose and affirmed unequivocally the \r\nimportance of pursuing joint efforts to end extremism \r\nand terrorism by cutting off their sources of financing. \r\nAs it happens, the crisis in Qatar is interfering with our \r\npolicies designed to combat terrorism and extremism \r\nand cut off their financing.\r\nMeanwhile, the Syrian crisis is entering its sixth \r\nyear, and the conflict has already claimed hundreds of \r\nthousands of victims. From the beginning, my country \r\nhas opened its doors to hundreds of thousands of \r\nSyrians. In general, the Middle East is going through \r\na period of unprecedented tensions and continuing \r\ncrises, in which Iran has played a part.\r\nTurning to the crisis in Qatar, we have continued \r\nwith a firm policy aimed at combating the fostering of \r\nextremism and terrorism through Doha’s provision of \r\nfinancial support to terrorism, as well as helping it to \r\ndisseminate violent hate speech. Qatar has also been \r\nproviding a safe haven for those who have violated the \r\nlaw and must be brought to justice, thereby helping \r\nto spread chaos and foment dissension. Our group of \r\nfour States has demanded firmly that Qatar adhere \r\nto the principles of international law where the fight \r\nagainst terrorism is concerned, including by honouring \r\nits obligations under the 2013 Riyadh Agreement and \r\nits complementary agreement of 2014, which are all \r\nlegitimate demands.\r\nIn its desire to affirm the principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations regarding the safeguarding \r\nof the peace and security of peoples around the \r\nworld, my country was one of the first to call for \r\nestablishing a zone free of nuclear weapons and other \r\nweapons of mass destruction in the Middle East. We \r\nhave also demonstrated the importance we attach to \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and their three \r\neconomic, social and environmental pillars through our \r\nVision 2030, aimed at enabling our country to achieve \r\nsustainable, people-centred development in order to \r\nbuild a more robust economy. And we have always \r\nstriven to provide support to developing countries by \r\nproviding official development assistance totalling \r\n0.7 per cent of our gross national income.\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to thank those who are \r\nhelping people everywhere, wherever they are, and \r\nwho are working for peace.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Darren Allen Henfield, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Immigration of the Commonwealth of \r\nthe Bahamas.\r\nMr. Henfield (Bahamas): On behalf of the people \r\nand the Government of the Commonwealth of the \r\nBahamas, I would like to congratulate the President on \r\nhis election to lead the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session and to assure him of my country’s full \r\nsupport and cooperation during his tenure. I would \r\nalso like to sincerely congratulate his predecessor, \r\nAmbassador Peter Thomson, on his stewardship of the \r\nAssembly during the seventy-first session.\r\nThe Bahamas congratulates Mr. António Guterres \r\non his recent appointment as Secretary-General, with \r\nthe daunting task of continuing the implementation of \r\nthe bold and ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. I commend him for the work he has done \r\nso far in steering the work of the Organization and \r\nassure him of the full support of the Bahamas.\r\nSince 29 September 1729, when the first meeting \r\nof the Parliament of the Bahamas took place, \r\ndemocratic values have taken deep root throughout \r\nthe archipelago. On 10 May this year, the Bahamas \r\nconducted its eleventh consecutive round of general \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 3/32\r\nelections since our establishment of universal suffrage \r\nin 1962. The people of the Bahamas, in a free, peaceful \r\nand democratic process, elected a Government led by \r\nMr. Hubert Minis. The new Administration is made \r\nup almost exclusively of new members, one of them \r\nas young as 21 years old. We promised our people \r\nbold change and we are committed to fulfilling that \r\npromise. We stand on the threshold of advancing a new \r\nagenda as demanded by our people, one that has at its \r\ncore the protection and promotion of the rights, interest \r\nand welfare of all Bahamians — women, men, young \r\npeople and children. I am therefore proud today to \r\nmake my first address to this organ as the most recently \r\nappointed Foreign Minister of the Commonwealth of \r\nthe Bahamas under this new administration.\r\nEconomies large and small are facing very difficult \r\ntimes, where myriad factors challenge our capacity to \r\ncreate an environment where people can be assured \r\nof sustainable livelihoods, security, safety and a \r\npromising future for succeeding generations. Very \r\ntroubling are the insidious increase in international \r\nterrorism; unfair practices in the international financial \r\nsector, such as de-risking and correspondent banking; \r\ncrime; trafficking in persons, drugs and weapons; \r\ngross violations of human rights; and reprehensible \r\ncorruption by those who have been entrusted to govern.\r\nOf special concern to small island developing \r\nStates (SIDS) are the dangers of environmental \r\ndegradation and climate change, which threaten our \r\nvery survivability. With what we have witnessed \r\njust recently with the passage of Hurricanes Harvey, \r\nIrma and now Maria, I cannot underscore sufficiently \r\nthe importance the Bahamas attaches to combating \r\nclimate change and the preservation and protection \r\nof the environment. Even while these hurricanes were \r\noccurring, earthquakes took place in Mexico, resulting \r\nin further tragic loss of life and destruction. Climate \r\nchange is global. We have expressed before and today \r\nwe reiterate our thoughts and prayers to all adversely \r\nimpacted by these devastating events.\r\nI need to emphasize that this is the third time in \r\nthree years that the Bahamas has been hit by a major \r\nhurricane, and Maria is still churning in our territory. \r\nThere are two more months before the end of the \r\nhurricane season, and we can only pray that we will \r\nbe spared further destruction and loss. Hurricane \r\nIrma changed course and did not directly hit the entire \r\nBahamian archipelago, thereby minimizing the impact \r\non our tourism industry. However, we were not entirely \r\nspared. Our southern islands experienced serious \r\ndamage. Ragged Island was totally devastated and is \r\nnow uninhabitable. Additionally, tornadoes inflicted \r\nconsiderable damage on the northern islands of Bimini \r\nand Grand Bahama.\r\nWe are grateful to our international partners, \r\nwhich provided immediate support after the passage \r\nof Hurricane Irma and now continue to stand by our \r\nside as we begin the painful and burdensome process \r\nof restoration and rebuilding. I commend the President \r\nand the Secretary-General for convening the recent \r\nhigh-level meeting to allow those of us impacted to \r\nbring focus on these events to our other partners.\r\nOne of the countries immediately affected by \r\nHurricane Irma was the Republic of Cuba, which, as \r\non previous occasions, caused this massive hurricane \r\nto lose some of its energy and probably lessened its \r\nimpact on our neighbour, the United States of America. \r\nAll developing countries affected have been placed \r\non a short list for assistance to shore up their internal \r\nconditions towards recovery. Cuba does not enjoy this \r\ncapacity to the fullest. The Bahamas joins other nations \r\nin calling for the United States Congress to reconsider \r\nthe legislative barriers to the biggest of the Caribbean \r\nislands in order for it to develop to its fullest potential \r\nas a member of the international community.\r\nIt is the intention of the Government, working with \r\nthe private sector, to create out of the destruction of \r\nRagged Island the first fully green island in the region, \r\nutilizing renewable energy and smart technologies, \r\nfrom solar energy to sustainable water-purification \r\nsystems, to create a more sustainable and resilient \r\nisland community.\r\nThe implications for the existence of SIDS such \r\nas the Bahamas, as we are confronted with global \r\nwarming, rising sea-levels, more severe and frequent \r\nhurricanes and other extreme weather events, are all \r\ntoo clear. For the first time in its history, the Bahamas \r\nevacuated whole communities to safe quadrants ahead \r\nof Hurricane Irma. What happens next — a wholesale \r\nevacuation of the entire Caribbean? I call on the \r\ninternational community to recognize the imperative \r\nof accelerating efforts to deal urgently with the \r\nadverse impact of climate change, and to do so in a \r\ncoordinated way. Only then will we mitigate against \r\nthese ferocious and frequent destructive weather \r\nevents, which now potentially threaten to add to the \r\nworld’s migration issues.\r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n4/32 17-29807\r\nWell over two decades ago, my Government, \r\nrecognizing the very real threat posed to our very \r\nexistence, upgraded its human capital capacity to \r\naddress the unintended consequences of climate change \r\nand its commitment to environmental conservation. \r\nThrough its many marine protected areas, the Bahamas \r\nis committed to the conservation of sustainable oceans, \r\nas well as through our active involvement in initiatives, \r\nsuch as the 10x20 initiative, and our participation in the \r\nconsultative process of biodiversity beyond national \r\njurisdiction. In this context, the Bahamas has presented \r\nits candidature once again for a seat on the Council of \r\nthe International Maritime Organization in category C.\r\nThe continuing imperative for us in the Bahamas and \r\nthe Caribbean is the re-evaluation of the measurements \r\nused to determine economic well-being. The \r\nInternational Monetary Fund (IMF), in its policy brief \r\non vulnerability and debt in small States, recognized \r\nthat many SIDS face an uncertain future. The Bahamas \r\ncontinues to dispute the use of per capita gross domestic \r\nproduct/gross national product as an instrument to \r\nmeasure wealth and economic development. The use \r\nof this one-dimensional instrument prohibits countries \r\nthat are most in need from receiving development \r\nassistance or loans at concessional rates. It is time for \r\nus to replace that metric with a realistic measurement \r\nthat takes into account the vulnerability and fragility of \r\nSIDS to exogenous shocks.\r\nNotwithstanding our best efforts at self-sufficiency, \r\nexogenous shocks in the form of reduced correspondent \r\nbanking relationships continue to create challenges \r\nfor the region. International banking institutions, \r\nfearing that they may be subject to fines and sanctions \r\nrelated to the illicit activities of money-laundering and \r\nterrorist financing, have pulled out en masse. Citizens \r\nin our region depend on the services provided by these \r\nentities and have now become severely disadvantaged \r\nas a result of the actions taken. This threatens our \r\nability to remain competitive as one of the leading \r\ninternational centres and hinders our efforts to expand \r\nour trading relations.\r\nThe head of the IMF, Ms. Christine Lagarde, spoke \r\nconvincingly in 2016 on the subject of correspondent \r\nbanking, highlighting that all stakeholders had to \r\nuphold their end of the bargain. For its part, the Bahamas \r\nhas invested in a strong compliance regime, at great \r\nfinancial cost. We invite the international community \r\nto work together to find another way to deal with the \r\nissue and allow input from those to be impacted by \r\ntheir decisions before moving the goal post yet again.\r\nDespite the challenges faced, the Government of \r\nthe Bahamas remains committed to a comprehensive \r\ndevelopment agenda for the country. With the launch \r\nof the national development plan Vision 2040 in the \r\ncoming months, we will set a course towards the \r\nachievement of the Sustainable Development Goals. \r\nIn this connection, the Bahamas has committed to \r\nparticipating in the voluntary national review process \r\nat the High-Level Political Forum on Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, under the auspices of the Economic and \r\nSocial Council, in 2018. We appreciate the support \r\nof the United Nations Development Programme and \r\nthe United Nations Economic Commission for Latin \r\nAmerica and the Caribbean in this regard. Indeed, it \r\nis through this anticipated integrated framework that \r\nwe shall address the range of challenges that face \r\nour nation.\r\nThe scourges of terrorism and trafficking in \r\narms of all types continue to impact our way of life. \r\nThe Bahamas reaffirms its commitment to standing \r\nwith the international community in the fight against \r\nterrorism in all its forms. We also stand in solidarity \r\nwith the peoples of France, Spain, Belgium and the \r\nUnited Kingdom, who have recently experienced \r\nhorrific terrorist attacks. Violence in the furtherance \r\nof political aims is never the answer. Only through \r\ndialogue and negotiations will aspirations be realized.\r\nI spoke earlier about the importance of \r\naccountability, truth and transparency in Government \r\nand the importance of the rule of law to good \r\ngovernance. According to the United Nations Office on \r\nDrugs and Crime,\r\n“Corruption is a global phenomenon found in \r\nall countries — but evidence shows it harms \r\npoor people more than others, stif les economic \r\ngrowth and diverts desperately needed funds from \r\neducation, health care and other public services. \r\nAn estimated $1 trillion get siphoned off through \r\nbribes every year, according to the World Bank.”\r\nThe Government of the Bahamas has firmly \r\ncommitted itself to eradicating criminality and \r\ncorruption. We are resolved to have in place an efficient, \r\nresults-based public sector, with an Office of the \r\nOmbudsman, in order to create the best environment \r\npossible for promoting economic development, foreign \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 5/32\r\ndirect investment, small business development and \r\nequal opportunity for all to share in prosperity.\r\nThe role of the United Nations in advancing \r\nhuman rights has been essential. The 1948 Universal \r\nDeclaration of Human Rights, a series of international \r\ninstruments, human rights operations on the ground \r\nand the various human rights bodies, such as the \r\nHuman Rights Council, permit the United Nations to \r\ncontinue as a beacon to promote and protect human \r\nrights through both immediate and long-term action.\r\nWe in the Bahamas are committed to protecting \r\nand promoting the rights of Bahamians and, indeed, all \r\nhumankind. The achievements of the Bahamas relative \r\nto human rights have derived from collaboration with \r\nall stakeholders and a willingness to explore fresh \r\napproaches to long-standing challenges. Within that \r\ncontext, I am pleased to announce that the Bahamas \r\nis seeking election to the Human Rights Council for \r\nthe term 2019-2021. As a member of the Council and a \r\nsmall island developing State, the Bahamas will bring to \r\nthat body a fresh, distinct and constructive perspective, \r\nwith the potential to add depth and richness to human \r\nrights advancement and discourse.\r\nThe Government of the Bahamas believes that \r\neducation must be at the heart of driving sustainable \r\ndevelopment, where we build resilience and an educated, \r\ninclusive and diverse workforce and community. That \r\nhas positive implications for the creativity, innovation \r\nand productivity that allow learners and young people \r\nto fulfil their potential to act as agents of social change. \r\nFor that reason, our Government has designed an \r\neducation agenda that encourages life-long learning \r\nand recognizes the potential of technology and \r\ndigital platforms to serve as tools in the teaching and \r\nlearning process.\r\nI take this opportunity to bring to the attention of the \r\nAssembly the fact that the Bahamas, in recognition of \r\nthe invaluable role of technology and communications \r\nin education and all aspects of development, has \r\npresented its candidature for a seat on the Council of \r\nthe International Telecommunication Union.\r\nThe New York Declaration for Refugees and \r\nMigrants, adopted in September 2016 by the General \r\nAssembly, called for the development of a global \r\ncompact for safe, orderly and regular migration. We \r\ncommend the ongoing work in preparation for the \r\nglobal compact. While recognizing the potential \r\nyields of global migration relative to the reduction of \r\npoverty and global inequality, we believe that proper \r\ncooperation, through the appropriate mechanisms, \r\ncan help to ensure that migration occurs through \r\nsafe and regulated channels, to the benefit of all \r\ncountries involved.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nrecognizes the targets to be achieved with respect to \r\nnon-communicable diseases and the need to mobilize \r\nthe necessary financing. We also recognize the \r\nsuccesses experienced in the global AIDS response, \r\nand caution the international community, at this \r\nimportant juncture, to resist complacency and continue \r\nto offer support to achieve targets and to sustain the \r\nJoint United Nations Programme on HIV and AIDS.\r\nThe Bahamas supports the work of peacekeeping \r\noperations and the Department under which they fall \r\nas a fundamental instrument to build, protect and \r\nmaintain peace and security within the United Nations.\r\nWe note the approach of the termination of the \r\nmandate of the United Nations Stabilization Mission in \r\nHaiti (MINUSTAH) and the establishment of the United \r\nNations Mission for Justice Support in Haiti. As was \r\nthe case with MINUSTAH, the Bahamas looks forward \r\nto doing its part to support Haiti’s continued national \r\ndevelopment. We also join the continued support and \r\nengagement of the international community in Haiti.\r\nDuring the main session, the General Assembly \r\nwill consider and approve the programme budget for \r\nthe biennium 2018-2019. It is our expectation that the \r\nGeneral Assembly will, in a transparent and constructive \r\nmanner, approve a budget that aligns with the mandates \r\nand activities of the United Nations. We welcome \r\nthe Secretary-General’s initial efforts to promote \r\nmanagement reform aimed at strengthening service \r\ndelivery. We encourage the Secretary-General, in the \r\nexecution of the budget, to continue to find innovative \r\nmeans to advance an efficient implementation of \r\nmandates, but without arbitrary cuts.\r\nThe Bahamas values the role of the United Nations \r\nas the custodian of the interests of the world’s people, in \r\nparticular the poor and the vulnerable. We believe that \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations remains a viable and \r\nfirm foundation onto which global peace and security, \r\nsocial progress and economic development can be built.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Alan Peter Cayetano, Secretary for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of the Philippines.\r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n6/32 17-29807\r\nMr. Cayetano (Philippines): Blessed are the \r\npeacemakers, for they shall be called children of God. \r\nThe path to peace must be walked with patience. In \r\norder to achieve any purpose with others, be they \r\nPowers or people, patience is needed. The opposite \r\nof patience is impatience, which is the cause and \r\naggravation of conflict.\r\nSomeone said that to jaw-jaw is better than to \r\nwar-war. Listening is even better than talking. We \r\nmust listen to others more than we listen to ourselves. \r\nHopefully, we know what we are talking about, but \r\nothers may know what we do not. We can learn only if \r\nwe stop talking and listen. We may think that we know \r\nhow others can do things better than they themselves \r\nhave done it. Maybe our way is more efficient. But \r\nthe time gained by that efficiency will be time lost \r\nconvincing others that our way is better, rather than \r\nreaching a compromise between our way and theirs.\r\nReal change in the world order necessitates \r\ncooperation. Nothing affecting others can be undertaken \r\nwithout their willing involvement and getting their \r\nagreement on the purpose and manner of the change. \r\nAchieving a shared purpose beyond any single person’s \r\nability requires cooperation. But how else can we get \r\ncooperation, if not with the patience to explain why it \r\nis needed and the equal patience to listen? That is why \r\nwe have the United Nations, the largest cooperative \r\nendeavour in human history. We use the United \r\nNations to speak out, but more importantly to listen. \r\nAnd somehow, we arrive at a consensus or at the very \r\nleast a modus vivendi on how to proceed in peace and, \r\ntherefore, with greater prospects for progress.\r\nThe theme for this year’s session, “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet”, captures a promise that everyone \r\nwho has stood here has vowed to fulfil for his or her \r\nown people, as well as for the rest of the peoples of \r\nthe United Nations, as the Preamble to the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations puts it. Yet, after 72 years, while \r\nmuch has been achieved, much more has to be done. \r\nThe promise is still very much a work in progress. We, \r\nthe peoples of the United Nations, battle new threats \r\nthat undermine the success that we have achieved and \r\nfrustrate progress in peace, development and human \r\nrights — the three pillars of the United Nations.\r\nThe theme mirrors the Philippines’ own people-\r\ncentred agenda, as articulated by our President Rodrigo \r\nRoa Duterte. President Duterte and the Filipino people \r\nare committed to real change in order to finally carry \r\nout long-needed reforms, address long-ignored national \r\nthreats and protect the human rights of all Filipinos \r\nwhile doing our part to attain regional peace and \r\nstability. We remain true to our obligations under the \r\ninternational treaties we have ratified. We have made \r\nmany sacrifices as a nation and as a people, and we \r\nshall continue to do so for peace and prosperity.\r\nThe Philippines integrates the human rights \r\nagenda into its development initiatives for the \r\npurpose of protecting everyone, especially the most \r\nvulnerable — families, women and children, the poor, \r\nindigenous people, migrant workers, the elderly and \r\npersons with disabilities — from lawlessness, violence \r\nand anarchy. That is why we have a massive campaign \r\nto restore the rule of law by fighting corruption, \r\ncrime and illegal drugs. We owe it to the 10 million \r\nFilipinos working overseas to keep their children and \r\nfamilies safe. We owe it to all Filipino families and \r\nother States with nationals living in our country to \r\nkeep the Philippines safe. The very principle of the \r\nresponsibility to protect must encompass, first and \r\nforemost, the vast majority of peaceful, law-abiding \r\npeople who need protection from those who are not. It \r\nis for their safety and sustenance that States exist, and \r\nfor which Governments and leaders are responsible.\r\nPresident Duterte said the fewest words and made \r\nthe fewest promises in the campaign. Why? Because \r\nhe listened. He listened and he heard what none of the \r\nother candidates would listen to. The vast majority \r\nof the Filipino people felt vulnerable in their lives \r\nand livelihoods, and unsafe in the rising drug-driven \r\ncriminality that threatened those least able to protect \r\nthemselves. These people whom past Governments had \r\nleast protected are the poor and ordinary folk.\r\nThe Philippines’ comprehensive campaign against \r\nillegal drugs is a necessary instrument to preserve and \r\nprotect the human rights of all Filipinos. It is never an \r\ninstrument to violate the human rights of any individual \r\nor group. It was noted by President Trump in this Hall \r\nthat\r\n“we do expect all nations to uphold the two core \r\nsovereign duties to respect the interests of their \r\nown people and the rights of every other sovereign \r\nnation” (A/72/PV.3, p. 10).\r\nThis is as true in bilateral relations between sovereign \r\ncountries as when they combine multilaterally on \r\na common decision or action. The Philippines is a \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 7/32\r\nsovereign country; indeed, it was the first subject \r\nnation to win its independence, however short-lived, \r\nthereby earning the honour of being the first republic \r\nin Asia.\r\nWe expect our sovereignty to be respected and \r\nour democratically elected Government’s assessment \r\nof threats and how to go about addressing them to be \r\naccorded pre-eminence among nations. Is it too much \r\nto ask for the benefit of the doubt, at the very least? We \r\nprize sovereignty in all its aspects. We acknowledge \r\nthe wisdom embodied in the words spoken by President \r\nTrump in this Hall: “All responsible leaders have an \r\nobligation to serve their own citizens” (ibid., p. 11). \r\nIn keeping with that obligation, it is the State’s duty \r\nto protect human life, human dignity, and human \r\nrights from aggression by other States, terrorism from \r\nnon-State actors and the destruction of societies and \r\nfamilies from criminal networks trafficking in drugs, \r\npeople and arms.\r\nAs a responsible leader, the President of the \r\nPhilippines launched a vigorous campaign against \r\nthe illegal drug trade to save lives, preserve families, \r\nprotect communities and stop the country from \r\nbecoming a narco-State — an epidemic would spell \r\nthe end of sovereignty in any meaningful sense. \r\nAs of August 2017, the drug trade had penetrated at \r\nleast 24,848 barangays, representing 59 per cent of \r\nthe 42,036 smallest Government units spanning our \r\narchipelago — those directly in touch with our people. \r\nIt is estimated that 4 to 7 million people have used or are \r\nbecoming dependent on drugs. Where is sovereignty in \r\na country where vast numbers are addicted to drugs \r\nand enslaved by their suppliers?\r\nTo be sure, drug addiction calls for cure and not \r\nchastisement. When the President showed his fierce \r\ndetermination to end the drug menace, 1.3 million drug \r\nusers turned themselves in. Their constitutional rights \r\nwere fully respected, and those who wanted a cure \r\nor rehabilitation were offered such options. But the \r\nneglect of the drug problem by previous Governments \r\nhas left the current one hard-pressed to rehabilitate \r\nthem all. We are grateful that generous souls at home \r\nand abroad are building centres around the country, \r\nand we sincerely thank them.\r\nWhile drug addiction calls for rehabilitation, drug \r\ntrafficking surely calls for stern measures, though \r\nalways consistent with the rule of law. The President \r\nhas and will always have zero tolerance for abusive \r\npolice officers, as time will show — I repeat, our \r\nPresident has zero tolerance for any type of abuse, be it \r\ndrug abuse, abuse of human rights, abuse of our laws or \r\nabuse by State actors, including our policemen.\r\nBut accusations before investigation do not \r\nconstitute proof, nor are they fair. Abuses have occurred \r\nand mistakes have been made — tragic ones, for sure. \r\nWhile one abuse is one too many, still there are far \r\nfewer abuses than the imaginary numbers claimed by \r\npartisan accusers and publicity-seekers. The drug trade \r\nhas even penetrated law enforcement and our courts, \r\nand yet the message we receive is that the best way to \r\nprevent abuse in the anti-drug campaign is to stop the \r\ncampaign and live with drugs instead.\r\nBut we cannot live with drugs, because drugs will \r\nnot let us live. Headlines today depict human rights \r\nabuse, but what about the headlines from yesterday, \r\nor last week? Two-year-olds, 4-year-olds and 6-year-\r\nolds were raped; mothers sold their children to feed \r\ntheir drug addictions; and children shot their parents \r\nbecause they believed them to be the devil.\r\nThe problem is that the West sometimes \r\nthinks that the kind of drugs that are present in its \r\nsocieties — heroin, cocaine and marijuana — are the \r\nsame drugs that we are talking about. We are talking \r\nabout methamphetamine hydrochloride, otherwise \r\nknown as shabu, which both the United Nations and \r\nthe World Health Organization have said is associated \r\nwith violence and paranoia. With cocaine, heroin and \r\nmarijuana, the drug war is among the suppliers, but \r\nwith methamphetamines, the war is within the family \r\nand every family affected by these drugs is a victim.\r\nWe can no more live with drugs than we can with \r\nterrorism which, as the United Nations admits — and \r\nas we have discovered — is funded by the drug trade. \r\nThis has created the new phenomenon of criminal \r\ninsurgency. In the century before last, a huge and well-\r\npopulated Asian country was enslaved by a maritime \r\nPower that f looded it with drugs. We welcome this \r\nopportunity to address the international community’s \r\nconcerns and correct the perceptions gleaned from \r\nmedia reports that deny the real scale of the problem, \r\nas if denial were a solution. The problem is huge and we \r\nwill not reduce it in our imagination because we dare \r\nnot face it in reality.\r\nAppeasement emboldens evil. We counsel patience, \r\nbut delay will make the problem bigger until it is \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n8/32 17-29807\r\nbeyond containment and control. Indeed, as we heard \r\nfrom President Trump in this Hall,\r\n“When decent people and nations become \r\nbystanders to history, the forces of destruction only \r\ngather power and strength” (ibid.).\r\nWe will not slide down the slope of complacency in \r\nwilful ignorance of the threat posed to our country and \r\nour people by the drug trade.\r\nIn the past four years, we have seen the rise of \r\nthe Islamic State and how it has spread its nihilistic \r\nideology beyond Iraq and Syria to become a serious \r\nthreat to the whole world. We should have no illusions \r\nthat the threat posed by the Islamic State will end with \r\nthe collapse of its self-proclaimed caliphate in Iraq, and \r\nvery soon in Syria. Rather, we should all be ready to \r\nconfront a very potent threat that has spread to other \r\nparts of the world.\r\nIn the Philippines, we have discovered the intimate \r\nand symbiotic relationship between terrorism, poverty \r\nand the illegal drug trade. Terrorists were somehow \r\nable to bring together an assortment of extremists, \r\ncriminals, mercenaries and foreign fighters who \r\nattempted, but failed, to take over the great city of \r\nMarawi. That was part of their grand plan to establish \r\nin South-East Asia an extension or province of their \r\nshattered caliphate in the Middle East.\r\nThe Armed Forces of the Philippines shall regain \r\nfull control of Marawi from the Islamic State-inspired \r\nterrorists. Their protracted hold of their remaining \r\nseveral square metres of the city is largely a result \r\nof superior arms that were illegally obtained and the \r\npresence of civilian hostages, used by them as human \r\nshields. There is also the Government’s forbearance to \r\nunleash greater force in order to avoid collateral loss \r\nof life. The fight has been terrible, but the effort has \r\nbeen patient and careful to spare the innocent. There \r\nhas been less talk and more listening to those with the \r\nmost at stake in the struggle — the people of Marawi. \r\nThe disturbance will soon be over and the rebuilding of \r\nMarawi will begin shortly.\r\nTerrorism is a global problem that no country can \r\ntackle alone, although here at the United Nations it has \r\nbeen noted with some admiration that Filipino families \r\noutside the conflict zone quickly absorbed most of \r\nthe 200,000 displaced civilians. Our main disaster \r\npreparedness is Filipino compassion. The Filipino \r\nfamily system is strong, the bayanihan system is alive, \r\nand cooperation is a tradition of the Philippines. Help \r\nfrom fellow Filipinos is always at hand. While the main \r\nburden is borne by our Government and people and all \r\nthe risks are taken by our soldiers, we are thankful \r\nfor the assistance extended to us by the international \r\ncommunity. From the bottom of my heart, I thank \r\nall who have helped, are continuing to help and have \r\npromised help. I thank those dear friends for helping \r\nwhen we needed it most.\r\nThe Philippines welcomes the creation of the United \r\nNations Office of Counter-Terrorism to bring together, \r\nas a cohesive whole, the work of Member States and \r\nthe United Nations on counter-terrorism. It will be a \r\nsharing of experience and sober ref lection rather than \r\nof blind anxieties. That is where real results will be \r\nachieved. As a founding Member of the United Nations, \r\nthe Philippines has been a strong advocate of the rule of \r\nlaw. We uphold the core of the United Nations mission \r\nto draw upon the strength and sovereign equality of its \r\nMembers to achieve their common goals.\r\nCenturies ago, ambitions to take land resulted \r\nin long and terrible wars. The battle has shifted to \r\nthe seas; hence the need to affirm our commitment \r\nto the United Nations Convention on the Law of the \r\nSea as the international law governing the rights and \r\nresponsibilities of States parties in their use of the \r\nworld’s oceans. The issues — including territorial \r\nclaims, sovereignty rights, security, and the protection \r\nof marine life and resources, to name a few — are \r\nundoubtedly numerous, intertwined and complex.\r\nDialogue, building trust and promoting cooperation \r\nare the way forward in addressing maritime disputes. \r\nThis year, as Chair of the Association of Southeast \r\nAsian Nations (ASEAN), the Philippines looks forward \r\nto successful negotiations on the long-overdue code of \r\nconduct in the West Philippine Sea/South China Sea. \r\nWe fully thank our ASEAN neighbours, the individual \r\nASEAN States and China for their utmost cooperation \r\nin that endeavour. Again, in this work, it is essential to \r\nhave patience, to listen and to be willing to work with, \r\nrather than against, each other.\r\nWe live in a global community, and we are citizens \r\nof the world. Today, our social contract is no longer \r\nconfined to our nation State. In our region, we exert \r\nefforts to build bridges and not walls; to emphasize \r\ncommonalities and not differences; to think less that \r\nwe are Filipinos, Thai, Indonesian, Japanese, Koreans \r\nor Chinese, and to think more of ourselves as Asian. \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 9/32\r\nBeyond being Asians, we are global citizens — the \r\npeople of the United Nations.\r\nHuman rights and the dignity of every person \r\nare the main pillars of the United Nations and of the \r\nPhilippines, too. As a very spiritual people, we are \r\nunited in believing that man and woman were created \r\nin God’s image. There can be no compromise of human \r\nrights for those who break the law, nor for those who \r\nare their victims. We also believe in accountability, \r\nespecially in the practical conviction that as we sow, \r\nso shall we reap.\r\nWe should never tolerate human rights abuses, \r\nbut neither should we tolerate misinformation or fake \r\nnews on or the politicization of human rights, as those \r\nundermine our collective efforts as the United Nations \r\nto uphold the universality of human rights and dignity \r\nof human life. But why debate security versus human \r\nrights? Security and human rights are not incompatible. \r\nIndeed, the former is our duty to the latter. Without \r\nsecurity, the most basic human rights to life and safety \r\nare constantly under attack from terrorism, criminality, \r\ndrug trafficking and human trafficking.\r\nMuch has been said about ASEAN, which is \r\nidentified with words such as cooperation, consultation \r\nand consensus. Critics have remarked on the slowness of \r\nASEAN’s way of proceeding. Yet, as slow as ASEAN’s \r\nprogress has been, it has been solid, substantive and \r\nirreversible, precisely because of the patience with \r\nwhich it is made. It is thereby proving to be a consensus-\r\nbased organization that is working, and working well.\r\nFive decades ago, South-East Asia was marred by \r\nconflicts, and all previous attempts at South-East Asian \r\nregionalism proved extremely difficult, if not impossible \r\nfor some. Our different cultures, differing ideologies \r\nand different political systems only reinforced that \r\npessimistic outlook. Fifty years later, the ASEAN \r\nmiracle prevails with greater political and economic \r\nprospects that have gripped global interest. ASEAN has \r\novercome the divisions, fears and hostilities of the past. \r\nWe have used regional cooperation to promote growth, \r\ndevelopment, integration and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes.\r\nToday, the Philippines patiently builds stronger \r\nrelationships with the international community through \r\nASEAN and the United Nations. We remain a friend \r\nto all and an enemy to none. We are here to bridge \r\nand build a more peaceful, secure and stable world. \r\nThere is no development without peace and no peace \r\nwithout development. That is what the 2030 Agenda for \r\nSustainable Development provides for. It serves as the \r\ntemplate of the Philippines development plan, called \r\nAmBisyon Natin 2040, or Our Ambition 2040.\r\nWhile the Philippines has experienced \r\nunprecedented economic growth, we are adopting \r\nmeasures to make growth more inclusive through \r\nmassive poverty-alleviation programmes that are \r\ncreating more jobs, driving innovation and making \r\nquality education universally available — relevant \r\neducation that imparts training and skill-building to \r\nmake people resilient in changing markets, building \r\ngreater trust in Government and hopes for raising tens \r\nof millions of Filipinos from poverty.\r\nThere is a link between increasing poverty, \r\ncorruption and a deteriorating environment. President \r\nRodrigo Roa Duterte seeks to reverse that linkage by \r\naddressing the adverse effects of climate change — to \r\nwhich the Philippines is most vulnerable — through \r\ndisaster-risk reduction and the strict implementation of \r\nlaws protecting the environment. He is equally decisive \r\non abuses that damage our environment.\r\nTo honour the immense sacrifices of our 10 million \r\nFilipinos abroad, and all other migrant workers of the \r\nworld who make huge sacrifices so that their families \r\nmay have a better life, we press on with our advocacy for \r\na global compact on migration. As we seek to improve \r\nconditions for foreign nationals living and working in \r\nthe Philippines, we advocate the fundamental concept \r\nof loving our neighbour as we love ourselves. We call on \r\nthe United Nations to elevate migration on its agenda.\r\nIf we listen to each other, we will hear the same \r\nthing. We have no need for nuclear weapons. Again, we \r\nhave no need for nuclear weapons. There is absolutely \r\nno benefit to another Cold War or to an arms race. We \r\nwant nuclear weapons to be a thing of the past, and we \r\ndo not want an arms race in any part of the world.\r\nOn 7 July, the Philippines joined 121 other Member \r\nStates in securing our world from weapons of mass \r\ndestruction by adopting the Treaty on the Prohibition of \r\nNuclear Weapons. Three days ago, I had the privilege \r\nof signing the Treaty on behalf of the Philippines. \r\nThe Philippines calls on Member States with nuclear \r\nweapons to likewise sign on in order to find a way to \r\nprovide the world with security without the threat of \r\nmass destruction. We can have a safe world only if \r\nwe get rid of all nuclear and other weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. By doing so, we shall save succeeding \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n10/32 17-29807\r\ngenerations from the scourge of war, which twice in \r\nour lifetime has brought untold sorrow to mankind.\r\nThe Philippines, on its own and as this year’s Chair \r\nof the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has \r\nexpressed its grave concern over the growing tensions \r\non the Korean peninsula because of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s missile test launches \r\nand detonations. The Philippines joins the call on \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to put a \r\nstop to its provocations, which bring us closer to an \r\nunimaginable scenario — a war to end all wars because \r\nno one will be left to fight new ones.\r\nLet me end where I began, and call again for \r\npatience, listening and cooperation, focused always \r\non the well-being of, as stated in the Preamble to the \r\nCharter of the United Nations, “We, the peoples of the \r\nUnited Nations”. Let us listen to each other as we all \r\nare the people of the United Nations. Our faith and \r\ndestiny as human beings on this planet are intertwined.\r\nIn a situation like the present, where every finger \r\nin and around the Korean peninsula is on a trigger \r\nand every eye is on the lookout for a wrong move, \r\nthe likelihood of a surprise attack is virtually zero. \r\nIn that context, no one can be caught by surprise and \r\nunprepared to strike back. So what is there to lose \r\nby going on talking and listening until the very last \r\nmoment, in the hope that a resolution will be found?\r\nPatience, listening as much as talking, and \r\ncooperation among friends and even enemies are the \r\nsignposts on the path of peace. Peace is about people. \r\nNo people and no country can have a national identity if \r\nthere are no others that can tell the difference. Without \r\npeople — each one different, yet all the same in their \r\nbeing and in the good they seek — it is impossible to \r\nimagine the world. To utter the phrase “the world” \r\nmeans a planet with many peoples sharing it.\r\nAll of us are pieces of a giant puzzle. We seek to be \r\ncompleted by being pieced together, thereby creating a \r\nwhole, beautiful picture. In a war of all against all, of \r\nevery one against the other, the last man standing is not \r\nat peace; rather, he is simply a single piece. He is not \r\nthe victor; he is simply alone.\r\nI congratulate the President on his election, and he \r\ncan count on the support of the Philippines.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Vivian Balakrishnan, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Singapore.\r\nMr. Balakrishnan (Singapore): I am honoured to \r\nspeak here on behalf of one of the world’s smallest city \r\nStates, the Republic of Singapore. First, I congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajcák on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. I also congratulate Mr. Peter Thomson \r\nof Fiji on his successful leadership as President at the \r\nseventy-first session.\r\nWe are meeting at a time of great uncertainty. The \r\nold fault lines of race, language and religion remain \r\nactive. There is renewed anxiety about jobs and \r\ninequality. New technologies and non-State actors are \r\nchallenging the international order. Terrorist groups \r\nare using the Internet to spread their poisonous, radical \r\nideologies, including in South-East Asia. Cyberattacks \r\nand fake news have proliferated. Conflicts in many \r\nregions of the world remain and new ones have emerged.\r\nIn North-East Asia, the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea’s reckless actions are raising \r\ntensions on the Korean peninsula. Singapore strongly \r\ncondemns the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s \r\nmissile and nuclear-weapon tests, which are in f lagrant \r\nviolation of Security Council resolutions. We call on \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea to avoid \r\nfurther provocations and to fully implement all of the \r\nresolutions adopted by the Security Council.\r\nIn Myanmar’s Rakhine state, a humanitarian \r\ndisaster has occurred in the aftermath of a terrorist \r\nattack on 25 August and related acts of violence. It is \r\na complex, intercommunal issue with deep historical \r\nroots, and it will not be solved instantly. It is the \r\nresponsibility of every Government to protect every \r\ncivilian, regardless of ethnicity, religious beliefs or \r\norigin. I visited Nay Pyi Taw last week and had a very \r\nfrank discussion with Daw Aung San Suu Kyi. She is \r\ndeeply troubled by what is happening in her own country \r\nand deeply distressed by the pain and suffering there.\r\nExtremists everywhere actually have a common \r\nplaybook. First, they commit an egregious act of \r\nviolence. Secondly, they stick a religious label on the \r\nsituation in order to convey a sense of “us versus them”. \r\nThirdly, they eliminate the grey zone of moderates by \r\ncausing alienation due to overreaction. And so, we \r\nmust be very careful that we do not fall into the trap \r\nof those extremists. As a doctor, I believe that the first \r\nrule of medicine is to do no harm. Therefore, as the rest \r\nof the world looks on with distress and alarm, we need \r\nto be very careful and measured in our response.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 11/32\r\nThe Association of Southeast Asian Nations \r\n(ASEAN) Foreign Ministers will be meeting later \r\ntoday. ASEAN supports Myanmar in seeking a long-\r\nterm solution to restore stability within its own \r\nborders. Singapore will work through ASEAN and \r\nwith Myanmar to extend humanitarian assistance to all \r\naffected communities.\r\nEvery country actually seeks to achieve the same \r\nthing — to ensure the security and prosperity of our \r\npeople and to create a better future for our children. \r\nBut no country, no matter how wealthy, big or powerful, \r\ncan achieve that alone. Multilateralism, international \r\nlaw, constructive interdependence and a sense of \r\nwin-win cooperation are crucial to the sustainable \r\ndevelopment and prosperity for all countries. Therefore, \r\na strong multilateral system reinforces the resilience of \r\nindividual countries. This is particularly true for small \r\nStates because we depend on a rules-based multilateral \r\nsystem for our survival and our success.\r\nToday, I want to speak, first, on the importance \r\nof multilateralism; secondly, on having an open \r\nglobal architecture; and thirdly, on having inclusive \r\neconomic growth.\r\nMy first point is on a universal, rules-based \r\nmultilateral system and why it is essential if we are \r\nto solve the complex problems facing the world today. \r\nNo nation can solve transboundary problems alone. \r\nWe need to work with each other, we need to build \r\nconsensus and we need to find effective solutions to \r\nglobal problems. The United Nations plays a critical \r\nrole in that regard as a platform for cooperation, based \r\non the principles of mutual respect, mutual benefit and \r\ninternational law. In fact, the United Nations is the \r\nuniversal body best placed to address the problems of \r\nthe global commons. A good example is the adoption of \r\nthe United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea \r\n(UNCLOS) in 1982, which is an enduring testament \r\nto what collective political will can achieve. Today, \r\nUNCLOS has become a constitution that governs the \r\nuse of the oceans.\r\nThe recent adoption of the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment showed that multilateralism can \r\nrespond to new challenges, especially when there \r\nis political will and collective commitment. When \r\ndealing with global issues such as climate change, \r\nthere is no alternative to a multilateral approach. The \r\nUnited Nations must also deal with emerging global \r\nchallenges, such as cybersecurity, counter-terrorism \r\nand the economic disruption caused by the emergence \r\nof digital technologies, including artificial intelligence \r\nand the potential for genetic engineering.\r\nIf the United Nations is to remain effective and \r\nrelevant, it must also become fit for purpose. There \r\nis much scope to optimize synergies and minimize \r\ninefficiencies within the United Nations system. In \r\nthis regard, Singapore strongly supports the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s efforts to reform and restructure the United \r\nNations. We welcome his management reforms and his \r\nefforts to review the United Nations development system \r\nso as to streamline the peace and security architecture.\r\nAs a small State, Singapore has always been a \r\nstrong supporter of an effective United Nations. This \r\nyear, we are proud that the Forum of Small States, \r\nfounded by Singapore in 1992, celebrates its twenty-\r\nfifth anniversary. Singapore is committed to working \r\nclosely with all States, especially small States, to \r\nsupport the work of the United Nations and to enhance \r\nits effectiveness. Regional organizations are also an \r\nimportant part of an effective multilateral, rules-\r\nbased system. They help to reinforce the principles \r\nof the Charter of the United Nations and to underpin \r\ninternational law at the regional and local levels. \r\nEqually important, they help to build confidence and \r\nencourage habits of cooperation.\r\nIn South-East Asia, ASEAN is celebrating its \r\nfiftieth anniversary. ASEAN has not only fostered \r\nregional economic integration, but perhaps even \r\nmore important, it has secured regional peace for five \r\ndecades and strengthened the national resilience of \r\neach of its members by creating a sense of common \r\nidentity in the midst of great diversity. The prospects \r\nfor ASEAN are very bright, and we have ambitious \r\nplans to do more, under our vision of a united, resilient \r\nand innovative ASEAN.\r\nMy second and related point concerns the need \r\nfor an open global architecture that is essential for \r\ngrowth and sustainable development. We have to make \r\na choice. One model is a world divided by rival blocs, \r\nrunning mercantilist economies, waging proxy wars \r\nand engaging in zero-sum competition. There is another \r\nmodel — one where there is a vision of a world with \r\nopen, interdependent, sovereign States characterized \r\nby enlightened long-term national interests, win-win \r\ncollaboration and sustainable development.\r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n12/32 17-29807\r\nIt should come as no surprise that Singapore, \r\nalmost by definition, has to support the latter model. \r\nWe believe that an open, rules-based, multilateral \r\nsystem allows every country to fulfil its potential and \r\nits duty to its citizens. In particular, it allows small \r\nStates, which are dependent on international trade \r\nand investments, to create a pathway for growth and \r\nresilience. It is therefore important, especially at this \r\ntime, to remain steadfast in the face of growing cause \r\nfor rising protectionism.\r\nAn open trading environment has allowed \r\ndeveloping countries to export their goods and services \r\nand raised hundreds of millions of people from poverty \r\ninto a new, rising middle class. Equally important, this \r\nrise of a prosperous middle class across Asia, Africa \r\nand South America has also been associated with \r\npeace and stability. The World Trade Organization \r\nis indispensable, as it underpins the rules-based \r\nmultilateral trading system and provides a framework \r\nfor resolving trade disputes.\r\nThe Group of Twenty (G-20) is another important \r\nplatform for discussing global macroeconomic \r\nand financial issues. However, it is important for \r\nthe G-20 to work closely with the United Nations \r\nand with non-members of the G-20 in order to \r\nstrengthen the multilateral system and to support the \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda. We welcome the \r\nefforts of successive G-20 Presidents to reach out to \r\nnon-members, in particular members of the Global \r\nGovernance Group. The Group will continue to be \r\nan advocate for a more accountable and inclusive \r\nframework of global governance.\r\nMy third and final point is on the need for inclusive \r\neconomic growth. Politically, the consensus for \r\nmultilateralism and an open global architecture will \r\nnot be sustained if people within our own States feel \r\nthat they are going to be left behind. In other words, \r\nwe need to make sure that there is inclusive economic \r\ngrowth that lifts all communities together. Indeed, the \r\n2030 Agenda is fundamentally a vision for achieving \r\nlong-term inclusive economic growth, not just at the \r\nnational level, but at the regional and global levels as \r\nwell. It is a vision shared by all countries. However, the \r\nchallenge for every Government is to generate higher \r\ngrowth and to create more jobs while ensuring that no \r\none is left behind.\r\nIn Singapore, quite frankly, we believe firmly in the \r\nrole of hard work, savings and self-reliance. However, \r\nwe also believe in taking care of the weak and vulnerable \r\nin every segment of our society. Consequently, our \r\npolicies on women, children, older persons and persons \r\nwith disabilities are designed to protect and uplift the \r\nmost vulnerable. We place great emphasis on racial and \r\nreligious harmony and in building social cohesiveness.\r\nBeyond resilience, successful societies have to \r\nembrace new technologies and encourage innovation. \r\nThe digital revolution is fundamentally changing the \r\nway we live, work, play, communicate, mobilize and \r\norganize our societies. We cannot wish away those \r\ndisruptive changes. Instead, we have to restructure our \r\neconomies and our societies, so that we can create new, \r\nbetter jobs for our people in this new digital world. \r\nHowever, that will not be an easy task; it does not come \r\nabout because of a speech or two.\r\nThe transformation caused by the digital revolution \r\nwill be positive only if we can find ways to share the \r\nbenefits more widely and to reduce inequality. It is \r\nworth remembering that at the beginning of every \r\nindustrial or technological revolution there is often a \r\nperiod of widening inequality, because the people or \r\nthe countries who experience it first have an enormous \r\nadvantage. It takes time for new tools and technologies \r\nto be democratized and commoditized so that a new \r\nmiddle class arises, bringing in a new golden age. We \r\nneed to do the same with this new revolution. That is \r\nwhy we in Singapore have invested heavily in education \r\nand skills, training our people, both young and old, \r\nto give everyone a chance to maximize opportunities \r\nand to harvest new potential from this new digital \r\nrevolution. We want every Singaporean to have a stake \r\nin our growth and to share in our success as a nation.\r\nLet me conclude by saying that the United Nations \r\nis absolutely essential, particulary for small States such \r\nas Singapore. The United Nations has been a catalyst \r\nfor peace and development for more than 70 years. It \r\nhas given a young State like Singapore, just 52 years \r\nold, enormous opportunities for amazing progress over \r\nthe past five decades. It has made a real difference to \r\nthe lives of people around the world.\r\nIn an environment of increased uncertainties, the \r\ncase for multilateralism becomes stronger, not weaker. \r\nNow more than ever, we need the United Nations to \r\nhelp us find solutions to difficult, complex problems, \r\nglobal and local. We need to safeguard and strengthen \r\nour multilateral, rules-based system so that even the \r\nsmallest State can survive and thrive as an independent, \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 13/32\r\nsovereign nation. We need an open global architecture \r\nbased on a vision of an interdependent world in order \r\nto secure, sustainable prosperity for every single one \r\nof us. But most important, we need inclusive and fair \r\neconomic growth to empower all our people to lead \r\ngood and meaningful lives.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on his Excellency \r\nSheikh Khalid Bin Ahmed Al-Khalifa, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs of the Kingdom of Bahrain.\r\nSheikh Al-Khalifa (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nAt the outset, I wish to wholeheartedly congratulate \r\nMr. Lajčák and his friendly country, Slovakia, on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\ncurrent session and to pledge our full cooperation in \r\nthe discharge of the duties with which he is entrusted. \r\nWe are fully confident that, thanks to his insight and \r\nclear vision, he will successfully conduct the business \r\nof this session. I also wish to praise his choice of theme \r\nfor  this session, “Focusing on people: Striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. \r\nThis important theme meets the expectations of all \r\ncountries and peoples. I also take this opportunity \r\nto express my deep appreciation to his predecessor, \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, for his able and \r\ncompetent presidency of the previous session.\r\nI renew my congratulations to Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres and applaud his tireless efforts, as \r\nref lected in his important report on the work of the \r\nOrganization (A/72/1), in which he demonstrates his \r\nresolve to reform its structure and management, enhance \r\nits role in the consolidation of international peace \r\nand security, and support sustainable development in \r\nresponse to the challenges and changing circumstances \r\nconfronting us. In that connection, I also applaud the \r\nefforts of His Excellency President Donald Trump of the \r\nUnited States of America to support the reform of the \r\nUnited Nations. The Kingdom of Bahrain was among \r\nthe first countries to sign the political declaration he \r\ninitiated in support of the Secretary-General’s reform \r\nplan for the United Nations.\r\nI would be remiss if I did not express the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain’s heartfelt condolences to the United States \r\nof America, Mexico and the Caribbean nations and \r\ntheir peoples on the natural disasters to which they \r\nhave been subjected and which caused numerous \r\nfatalities and material damage. I reiterate our solidarity \r\nwith them and pray that they will soon recover from \r\ntheir impact.\r\nUnder the leadership of His Majesty King Hamad \r\nbin Isa Al Khalifa, King of the Kingdom of Bahrain; \r\nHis Royal Highness Prince Khalifa Bin Salman Al \r\nKhalifa, Prime Minister; and His Royal Highness \r\nPrince Salman bin Hamad Al Khalifa, Crown Prince, \r\nDeputy Supreme Commander and First Deputy Prime \r\nMinister, the Kingdom of Bahrain remains faithful to \r\nits consistent policy of enhancing partnerships with \r\nthe United Nations and its various bodies in expression \r\nof its firm belief in the role that our Organization is \r\nplaying to achieve a more stable and prosperous world.\r\nAccordingly, this year has witnessed numerous \r\ninitiatives for fruitful cooperation, notably the \r\nlaunching of the King Hamad Youth Empowerment \r\nAward to Achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, \r\naimed at consolidating the efforts of governmental and \r\nprivate entities to enhance the contribution of young \r\npeople to the sustainable development process.\r\nIn March, the Princess Sabeeka bint Ibrahim Al \r\nKhalifa Global Award for Women’s Empowerment \r\nwas officially launched. That award, named after the \r\nwife of His Majesty the King and President of the \r\nSupreme Council for Women, is in full conformity \r\nwith the objectives of the United Nations in enhancing \r\nthe role of women in development. It also ref lects \r\nthe pioneering experience of Bahraini women, both \r\nnationally and internationally.\r\nSimilarly, the International Youth Conference to \r\nAchieve Sustainable Development was held under the \r\npatronage of His Highness Shaikh Nasser bin Hamad \r\nAl Khalifa, Representative of His Majesty the King \r\nfor Charity Works and Youth Affairs, in collaboration \r\nwith the United Nations Development Programme. \r\nIt focused on raising awareness among young people \r\nof the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and \r\nenhancing their role in achieving them.\r\nIn the context of Bahrain’s keen interest in pursuing \r\nits efforts to achieve the SDGs and to maintain its \r\nleading position among countries with very high \r\nindicators in the field of human development, according \r\nto international sources, Bahrain looks forward to \r\nthe forthcoming signing of a strategic partnership \r\nframework with the United Nations for the period 2017-\r\n2020.\r\nMy country has also made strides towards the \r\nelimination of forced labour and human trafficking \r\nby ratifying the relevant international agreements and \r\nprotocols. It further issued an act prohibiting all forms \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n14/32 17-29807\r\nof human trafficking, with severe sentences imposed on \r\nthe perpetrators, while also implementing the national \r\nreferral system for the victims of trafficking — the first \r\nof its kind in the region — which provides a mechanism \r\nto monitor and redress that illegal practice.\r\nRecently, the Kingdom of Bahrain issued the Unified \r\nFamily Law, a key legislative tool for the consolidation \r\nof the family’s stability and the preservation of all its \r\nrights without exploitation or mistreatment. That is \r\nbased on the noble teachings of Islam and the principles \r\nenshrined in the Bahraini Constitution that the family is \r\nthe foundation of society. That law equally exemplifies \r\nBahrain’s commitment to international instruments \r\nrelated to the family and women, including, most \r\nimportantly, those of the Committee on the Elimination \r\nof Discrimination against Women.\r\nIn support of the United Nations endeavours to \r\naddress global warming and its implications in the area \r\nof climate change, the Kingdom of Bahrain deposited \r\nits instrument of ratification of the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change in December 2016, thereby renewing \r\nits commitment to that historic agreement, which we \r\nhope will consolidate international efforts to address \r\nthat perilous phenomenon.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain firmly believes that the \r\nmaintenance of stability and security in the Middle \r\nEast and the entire world requires a strong and common \r\npolitical will, as well as serious collective efforts to \r\nguarantee respect for the basic principles underlying \r\nrelations among States, such as good-neighbourliness, \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of others \r\nand compliance with international conventions and \r\ninstruments, so that we can address the greatest \r\nchallenge facing us, namely, terrorism, and deter \r\nindividuals and entities from supporting and financing \r\nit. That is especially important now that terrorism is no \r\nlonger limited to terrorist organizations that we are able \r\nto confront and eliminate. Rather, it has become a tool \r\nin the hands of States determined to generate crises in \r\nother countries in the pursuit of their own agenda. They \r\nhave consequently become fully complicit partners in \r\nthe commission of terrorist acts and a factor in the \r\ndestabilization of international peace and security.\r\nGiven the strategic importance of peace and \r\nsecurity for our vital region, my country is seeking to \r\nestablish strategic partnerships within its own region \r\nand with its allies. As partners, we can work together \r\nto preserve the security of the Gulf region, combat \r\nterrorism and provide protection for international \r\nnavigation and commerce routes, in particular through \r\nclose cooperation between the Bahrain Defense Force \r\nand the American Fifth Fleet, based in the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain.\r\nThe summit of the States of the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil (GCC) and the United States of America \r\nwas held in May this year in the Kingdom of Saudi \r\nArabia and produced a memorandum of understanding \r\nto establish a centre responsible for combating the \r\nfinancing of terrorism. That and the Arab-Islamic-\r\nAmerican summit are both important landmarks in \r\ncombating terrorism in that they establish a strategic \r\nand effective partnership among the United States of \r\nAmerica, the States of the GCC and the other Arab \r\nIslamic countries.\r\nWe reaffirm that the Global Center for Combating \r\nExtremist Ideology, which was inaugurated in Riyadh \r\non the sidelines of the GCC-United States summit, \r\nwill make a significant contribution to combating \r\nextremist ideologies and will promote the values of \r\ntolerance and coexistence throughout the world. In that \r\ncontext, I commend the General Assembly’s adoption \r\nof resolution 71/291, which established the Office \r\nof Counter-Terrorism, an important step towards \r\nthe consolidation of international efforts to address \r\nthat scourge.\r\nIt is no longer acceptable that among us there are rogue \r\ncountries that continue to occupy others’ territories, \r\nthereby violating the sovereignty of States, threatening \r\ninternational peace and security, supporting extremism \r\nand terrorism, and spreading hate and anarchy. It is no \r\nlonger tenable that we allow those countries to join \r\nour efforts to end struggles, resolve conflicts and halt \r\ncomplex humanitarian tragedies — situations that those \r\ncountries were responsible for aggravating. We should \r\nrefuse them the opportunity to be included among us \r\nand to misuse their voice to satisfy their ambitions \r\nand hostile goals. Confronting those countries is a \r\nduty and a responsibility that the entire international \r\ncommunity must shoulder. They should either respect \r\ntheir commitments and keep pace with the collective \r\ninternational will to achieve peace, development and \r\nwelfare, or be held clearly accountable and suffer \r\nisolation and the severe consequences of international \r\nresolutions and laws.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, and to consolidate \r\nanti-terrorist and anti-extremist efforts, the Kingdom \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 15/32\r\nof Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United \r\nArab Emirates and the Arab Republic of Egypt, with \r\nthe support of many other countries, availed themselves \r\nof their sovereign right under international law to \r\nsever relations with Qatar. That followed a long period \r\nof patience during which we exhausted all available \r\nmeans to halt Qatar’s policies that violated all fraternal \r\nrelations of good-neighbourliness and non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of States.\r\nQatar provided financial support and safe haven \r\nto terrorists and fugitives and disseminated a narrative \r\nreplete with hate and extremism through its media and \r\nthe individuals and institutions supporting it — all \r\nof whom we have placed on a unified terrorist list \r\nand most of whom are also included on international \r\nterrorist lists. That was done to make the situation \r\nclear to the entire world following the fallout of that \r\nterrorism, which spread to many countries, including \r\nmy own. Qatar has supported systematic terrorist acts \r\nwhose consequences we have suffered in the Kingdom \r\nof Bahrain and which have cost us the lives of many \r\ninnocent civilians and security personnel. It has done \r\nso with a view to undermining national security and \r\nsocietal peace and overthrowing the Government \r\nsystem with the support of their affiliates.\r\nIt is therefore our collective responsibility to \r\nprotect our States and peoples from those who seek to \r\nharm them, and to confront them firmly. If Qatar is \r\nserious — by its actions and not only its words — about \r\nengaging in dialogue and reclaiming its place among us, \r\nit must respond positively and commit to our reasonable \r\ndemands in full transparency, based on the principles \r\nenshrined in the joint statement issued following \r\nmeeting of the four countries in Cairo on 5 July 2017, \r\nin full conformity with international covenants and \r\ninstruments. In that connection, we highly appreciate \r\nthe tireless efforts and the good offices of His Highness \r\nSheikh Sabah Al-Ahmad Al-Jaber Al-Sabah, Amir of \r\nthe State of Kuwait.\r\nWe stress the fact that all actions taken against \r\nQatar are directed neither against our peoples nor the \r\nQatari people, for whom we have nothing but respect \r\nand affection and with whom we are linked by religion, \r\nfamily relations and a common history. We will always \r\nsupport their security and stability, and to that end, our \r\ncountries have taken a number of measures to address \r\nthe humanitarian issues, including those concerning \r\nfamily relations and health conditions. That was clearly \r\nshown by the facilities recently provided to Qataris \r\nby the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, including for Hajj \r\nand Umrah. That confirms the solid ties and refutes \r\nassertions of blockades or violations of human rights.\r\nI take this opportunity to express my country’s \r\ncongratulations to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for the \r\ngreat success of the Hajj season, which has been widely \r\npraised by all those participating in that major Islamic \r\nrite. It is a meaningful riposte to all those seeking \r\nto politicize the Hajj and turn it into an occasion \r\nfor fomenting conflict and sedition. In attending to \r\nits highest priority, the Saudi Government thereby \r\ndemonstrated its outstanding ability to protect the Two \r\nHoly Mosques and other sacred sites, as well as all the \r\nvisitors performing the rites of Hajj or Umrah.\r\nRegimes that constantly seek to spread anarchy \r\nand evil are instruments of destruction and will be the \r\nbiggest losers as they drift away from the values of \r\ncollective cooperation among nations. Such is the case \r\nof the Islamic Republic of Iran, where the people suffer \r\nfrom oppression, misery and poverty while gallows \r\nare erected in the streets. Living conditions are harsh \r\nand have taken that people — who are rich in history \r\nand civilization — backward dozens of years. Their \r\nresources are wasted to fuel violence and undermine \r\nthe region’s security for the sake of realizing Iran’s \r\nhegemonic and expansionist ambitions through its \r\nRevolutionary Guard and its affiliates, such as the \r\nterrorist Hizbullah in Lebanon and Syria, the militias \r\nin Yemen and the terrorist cells and groups in the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, \r\nthe State of Kuwait and the Republic of Iraq, as well \r\nas other countries that have suffered because of those \r\nhostile actions for such a protracted period.\r\nWe believe that the statement by the American \r\nPresident before the General Assembly (see A/72/PV.3) \r\npresents an accurate interpretation that clearly denounces \r\nthe dangerous nature of the Iranian rogue regime, \r\nwhich undermines peace in the region. The world must \r\nconfront that regime, stop it from pursuing its policies \r\nand financing of terrorism and oblige it to respect its \r\nneighbours’ sovereignty. Since we always aspire to \r\npeace, we affirm that establishing normal ties with \r\nIran is subject to the latter relinquishing its hegemonic, \r\nsectarian and ideological policies. Iran must respect the \r\nnational values of peoples and refrain from exporting \r\nits revolution, which is based on a theocratic system \r\nof government. It must abide by the principles of good \r\nneighbourliness and non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of countries.\r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n16/32 17-29807\r\nWe also call on Iran to end its occupation of the \r\nthree Emirati islands — Greater Tunb, Lesser Tunb \r\nand Abu Musa — and to respond favourably to the \r\npeaceful initiative of the United Arab Emirates to \r\nrecoup sovereignty over its territories, either through \r\ndirect and serious negotiations, or by referral to the \r\nInternational Court of Justice.\r\nOn the other hand, the Republic of Iraq, which has \r\nsuffered for so long and is still suffering from foreign \r\ninterference, has recently achieved, with the means \r\navailable to it, the liberation of the cities of Mosul \r\nand Tal Afar from the grip of Da’esh. That would not \r\nhave been possible without the immense sacrifices \r\nby the Iraqi armed forces, the determination by the \r\nGovernment under Haider Al Abadi and the support \r\nprovided by the Global Coalition against Da’esh, of \r\nwhich Bahrain is an active member. We reaffirm our \r\nconstant support for all efforts aimed at restoring \r\npeace and security throughout Iraq and preserving its \r\nindependence, sovereignty and territorial integrity.\r\nWith regard to the situation in the Republic of \r\nYemen, we reiterate our firm position of support for \r\nthe legitimate Government under the leadership of \r\nPresident Abdrabuh Mansour Hadi Mansour. We \r\nsupport that Government through our participation \r\nin the Arab coalition to support legitimacy in Yemen \r\nand through our support for the measures taken by the \r\nlegitimate Government to extend its authority over \r\nall of Yemeni territory and to put an end to militias \r\nthat attempt coups d’état with the support of foreign \r\npowers. We support the Government’s steps to reach \r\na comprehensive political solution on the basis of \r\ninternational mandates, notably the Gulf Cooperation \r\nCouncil Initiative and its Implementation Mechanism, \r\nthe outcomes of the national dialogue and Security \r\nCouncil resolution 2216 (2015). That will terminate \r\nall forms of foreign intervention and put an end to the \r\ncritical humanitarian situation of the Yemeni people.\r\nWe reaffirm that we do not side with any one \r\nYemeni party against the other, but rather we oppose \r\nforeign intervention that seeks to harm this beloved \r\ncountry. We appreciate the efforts of Mr. Ismail Ould \r\nCheikh Ahmed, Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Yemen.\r\nWe in the Syrian Arab Republic urge the \r\ninternational community to exert greater efforts to \r\nprotect civilians and save their lives, to compel all \r\nparties to abide by the ceasefire decision and the \r\nestablishment of the de-escalation zones, to guarantee \r\naccess to besieged areas for the delivery of humanitarian \r\nassistance, and to intensify support to countries hosting \r\nlarge numbers of our Syrian brethren, most notably \r\nthe Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. That is in addition \r\nto pushing forward all efforts aimed at achieving a \r\npolitical solution that would preserve Syria’s unity and \r\nterritorial integrity while ending foreign intervention \r\nin its internal affairs. The solution should also see \r\nthe abolition of all terrorist organizations and provide \r\npeace and security to all Syrians so they can actively \r\nparticipate in the determination of their own future, on \r\nthe basis of the first Geneva communiqué (A/66/865, \r\nannex) and Security Council resolutions 2254 (2015) \r\nand 2268 (2016).\r\nWe reaffirm our support for the Astana talks \r\nand the action of the Special Envoy of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral for Syria, Mr. Staffan de Mistura, in the \r\nhope that they will contribute to the resolution of this \r\nprotracted crisis.\r\nIn Libya, we applaud the liberation of a number \r\nof major cities from the hands of terrorist groups. We \r\nreaffirm our full support for the efforts of all actors \r\nto achieve consensus among all Libyan parties and for \r\nthe implementation of the political agreement signed \r\nin Skhirat. Those efforts include those by Libya’s \r\nneighbouring countries and the meetings held in the \r\nUnited Arab Emirates and the French Republic between \r\nMr. Faiez Serraj, President of the Presidency Council of \r\nthe Government of National Accord of Libya, and Field \r\nMarshal Khalifa Haftar, Commander-in-Chief of the \r\nLibyan army. We hope that such efforts will continue \r\nwith a view to preserving Libya’s unity and territorial \r\nintegrity, consistent with the aspirations of the people \r\nfor development and progress. We also welcome \r\nthe appointment of Mr. Ghassan Salamé as Special \r\nRepresentative of the Secretary-General in Libya and \r\nwish him every success.\r\nWith regard to the question of the Moroccan Sahara, \r\nthe Kingdom of Bahrain reaffirms the need to support \r\nthe negotiations aimed at achieving a consensual and \r\nfinal political solution to that problem, in the context of \r\nnational sovereignty of the Kingdom of Morocco and on \r\nthe basis of relevant Security Council resolutions that \r\nconfirm the seriousness of Morocco’s self-government \r\ninitiative. We urge all parties to fully cooperate with \r\nthe United Nations in that regard.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 17/32\r\nWe reiterate our total objection to the plight of \r\nMuslims in Myanmar as a result of excessive use of \r\nforce. We call on the Myanmar Government to assume \r\nits responsibilities in protecting the Rohingya Muslims \r\nand to facilitate their access to all forms of relief and \r\nassistance so as to put an end to this human tragedy.\r\nThe Palestinian question is at the top of the foreign-\r\npolicy priorities of the Kingdom of Bahrain, which \r\nhas always stood with the Palestinian people in their \r\nlegitimate aspirations to enjoy all their legitimate rights, \r\nincluding an independent State with East Jerusalem as \r\nits capital and within the borders of 4 June 1967, in \r\nconformity with the relevant international resolutions, \r\nthe Arab Peace Initiative and the two-State solution.\r\nWe welcome the positive steps taken lately by \r\nPalestinian factions to end their divisions in favour of \r\nthe vital Palestinian interests through political work \r\nand non-violence. We commend the pivotal role played \r\nby His Excellency President Abdel Fattah Al Sisi of the \r\nArab Republic of Egypt in that respect. It confirms the \r\ncentral role of Egypt in the support of causes related \r\nto the Arab nation, of which it constitutes the strategic \r\ncentre. It is the main pillar of peace and security in \r\nthe region.\r\nThe Palestinian question is not a religious issue. \r\nPalestine is the cradle of religions where everyone \r\nlived in perfect harmony. Rather, it is a political issue \r\npar excellence, an issue of territorial occupation that \r\nmust end. Its people must return to their homeland. \r\nRights denied must be restored to their owners. That \r\nprecisely is what Israel, notwithstanding all its security \r\nconcerns, should understand, for it will achieve peace \r\nfor its people and for itself only when it abandons all \r\nforms of violence against Palestinians. It should halt its \r\nsettlement activities and stop violating the sanctity of \r\nreligious sites, especially the repeated aggressions and \r\nprovocative acts in the holy Al-Aqsa Mosque, which \r\nenrage Muslims all over the world and impede the \r\nresumption of the peace process and all regional and \r\ninternational initiatives in its support.\r\nAt this juncture, we wish to express our sincere \r\nappreciation for the commendable work of the United \r\nNations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine \r\nRefugees in the Near East and the substantial assistance \r\nit provides the Palestinians inside the territory and in \r\nthe neighbouring countries.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain stresses the need to \r\nachieve universal adherence to the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty, taking into account the \r\nright of all peoples to use nuclear power for peaceful \r\npurposes. Also, Israel should implement the resolution \r\nissued by the 1995 Review and Extension Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons pertaining to a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nMiddle East. Equally, we stress the need for Iran to \r\nimplement Security Council resolution 2231 (2015), on \r\nthe Iranian nuclear agreement, including those parts \r\nconcerning ballistic and other weapons. Iran will face \r\nsevere sanctions if it violates the commitments outlined \r\nin that resolution or in the international safeguard \r\nsystem of the International Atomic Energy Agency. \r\nFurther, we welcome Security Council resolution 2375 \r\n(2017), which pertains to new sanctions on North Korea, \r\nin view of its continued nuclear and ballistic missiles \r\ntests, which threaten its neighbours and international \r\npeace and security.\r\nSince its inception as an Arab and Islamic entity \r\nin 1783, the Kingdom of Bahrain has firmly believed \r\nin the importance of collective action in the pursuit of \r\nsecurity, development and prosperity. It orients all of its \r\nmeans toward the service of its people, its region and \r\nthe world as a whole. Since time immemorial, Allah \r\nhas blessed it with wise leadership that has inherited \r\nan acute sense of responsibility for the achievement \r\nof the ultimate objectives of ideal relations with \r\nits neighbours. It will steadfastly follows that path \r\nand will never go astray. It will remain an effective \r\nmember of the international community and a trusted \r\npartner in its Arab and Islamic setting and will hold \r\nonto that approach as the solid foundation of its foreign \r\nrelations. We will remain open to all cultures and \r\npeoples, in the spirit of tolerance and moderation, and \r\nwill pursue the path to progress and development with \r\ndetermination and perseverance in order to safeguard \r\nour achievements, development and prosperity.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Saleumxay Kommasith, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic.\r\nMr. Kommasith (Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic): At the outset, on behalf of the delegation \r\nof the Lao People’s Democratic Republic, I would \r\nlike to extend my congratulations to His Excellency \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election to the presidency \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nI am confident that with his extensive diplomatic \r\nexperience, he will guide the session with great \r\nsuccess. We stand ready to extend our full support and \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n18/32 17-29807\r\ncooperation to him in the discharge of his noble duty. \r\nLikewise, let me extend my profound congratulations \r\nto His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson for the successful \r\ncompletion of his tenure as the President of the \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nOnce again, let me take this opportunity to extend \r\nmy congratulations to His Excellency Mr. António \r\nGuterres on his appointment as the Secretary-General \r\nand for his initiative on the management reform of the \r\nUnited Nations, so that the Organization can respond \r\neffectively to the current global challenges. I hope that \r\nsuch efforts will contribute to the attainment of the aims \r\nand objectives of the Charter of the United Nations.\r\nMay I join other representatives in extending our \r\ndeep sympathy to the countries of Latin America and \r\nthe Caribbean that have been severely affected by \r\nrecent natural disasters.\r\nMr. Brown (Liberia), Vice-President, took \r\nthe Chair.\r\nToday, the current global geopolitical landscape is \r\nfraught with myriad challenges that pose major threats \r\nto peace and security and hamper the development \r\nof countries and regions of the world. Therefore our \r\nconcerted efforts are required to overcome those \r\nobstacles and challenges so that people in different \r\ncountries and regions of the world can live their lives \r\nin durable peace and prosperity. That is why the theme \r\nchosen for the seventy-second session — “Focusing \r\non people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet” — is apt, as the international \r\ncommunity is focusing on the implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which has \r\npromised to leave no one behind.\r\nIt is my firm belief that peace and security remain \r\nthe common aspiration of the international community. \r\nTherefore, in order to maintain and promote peace \r\nand development, it is incumbent upon us to enhance \r\ncollaboration so that peace and sustainable development \r\ncan prevail in our world. The United Nations, which \r\nis the only universal Organization with mandates \r\nto maintain and promote peace and cooperation for \r\ndevelopment, has to be at the forefront. To realize those \r\nobjectives, the United Nations needs to be reformed in \r\nsuch a way that it can respond to the current needs and \r\npressing challenges of today.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic earnestly \r\nhopes to see a world without nuclear and other weapons \r\nof mass destruction. In that context, we welcome the \r\nrecent adoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of \r\nNuclear Weapons, which we also signed two days ago. \r\nHowever, we are well aware that we still have an uphill \r\ntask ahead of us for the Treaty to enter into force and be \r\neffectively implemented. Therefore, the international \r\ncommunity has to redouble its efforts in that respect.\r\nThroughout the past decades, we have seen \r\nthat many countries in the world have experienced \r\nsustained economic growth and rapid development, \r\nwhich have lifted hundreds of millions of people out \r\nof poverty. That is thanks to peace and security, which \r\nhave been essential prerequisites for the social and \r\neconomic advancement of nations. At the same time, \r\nthe improvement of people’s well-being will have a \r\npositive impact on political stability and social order \r\nand will help to reduce conflicts. Past experience shows \r\nthat settling disputes by peaceful means and through \r\ndiplomatic solutions is the best way to do so, as it is \r\nmore durable and causes no loss of lives or property. \r\nThus, it is important for the international community to \r\nfurther build mutual trust and f lexibility and to jointly \r\naddress the root causes of problems.\r\nIn that spirit, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic \r\ncalls on all parties involved in disputes or conflicts in \r\nvarious regions of the world to exercise the utmost \r\nrestraint and resolve such conflicts through diplomatic \r\nand peaceful means so as to de-escalate tensions. as \r\nwe firmly believe that only a peaceful environment can \r\nform a foundation for advancing national social and \r\neconomic development.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic welcomes \r\nthe re-establishment of diplomatic relations between \r\nthe United States of America and the Republic of \r\nCuba and earnestly hopes that such relations will be \r\nenhanced, leading to the lifting of the embargo in \r\nthe near future. That would bring about real benefits \r\nto the peoples of the two countries, as well as to \r\nthe region and the world at large. Likewise, the Lao \r\nPeople’s Democratic Republic also hopes that the \r\nPalestinian issue, which has lasted for many decades, \r\nwill be resolved through peaceful means, with a view \r\nto creating two independent States of Palestine and \r\nIsrael, living side by side in peace, security and within \r\ninternationally recognized borders, as stipulated in the \r\nrelevant resolutions of the Security Council.\r\nThis year, the Association of Southeast Asian \r\nNations (ASEAN) turns 50. Over the past five decades, \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 19/32\r\nASEAN has gone through a number of challenges \r\nand has adjusted itself to the changing regional and \r\ninternational environment, while taking into account \r\nits diversity and the particularities in the region. It \r\nhas achieved progress gradually, which led to the \r\nestablishment of the ASEAN Economic Community at \r\nthe end of 2015.\r\nThe most remarkable achievement of ASEAN is \r\nits maintenance of peace, security and stability in the \r\nregion, thus creating favourable conditions for ASEAN \r\nmember States for the pursuit of their socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment and regional economic integration. At \r\nthe same time, ASEAN has strengthened its relations \r\nwith external parties, especially its dialogue partners \r\nin a substantive and comprehensive manner, based on \r\nmutual benefit. Importantly, ASEAN centrality has \r\nbeen recognized by all external partners under ASEAN-\r\ninitiated mechanisms. Countries in the region and \r\nbeyond are keen to forge cooperation with ASEAN, as \r\nit provides a venue for them to participate in discussions \r\non many important regional and international issues \r\nof common interest and concern, thereby promoting \r\nmutual understanding and trust among participants, as \r\nwell as peace, stability and development in the region \r\nand the world.\r\nASEAN’s achievements have been possible \r\nthanks to the ASEAN Way, which is an important \r\nfactor, especially the principles of consultation and \r\nconsensus and moving at a pace comfortable to all. The \r\nASEAN Way signifies ASEAN centrality and unity. \r\nThe ASEAN Way remains relevant, and ASEAN will \r\ncontinue to uphold its principles in the years to come.\r\nThe Lao People’s Democratic Republic attaches \r\ngreat importance to the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development. Since its \r\nadoption, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) \r\nhave been streamlined into our national socioeconomic \r\ndevelopment plan for 2016-2020, and a national \r\nsteering committee for the implementation of the \r\nSDGs, which is chaired by our Prime Minister, has \r\nbeen formally established. At the High-level Political \r\nForum on Sustainable Development held in July, the \r\nLao People’s Democratic Republic registered to submit \r\nand present our Voluntary National Review in 2018. All \r\nthis has demonstrated our Government’s firm political \r\nwill and unwavering commitment to implementing and \r\nachieving the SDGs, as well as to building a strong \r\nfoundation to support our country’s aspirations to \r\ngraduate from the status of least developing country \r\nby 2020.\r\nIn pursuit of fostering an enabling environment \r\nconducive to achieving sustainable development, the \r\nLao Government has undertaken an important initiative \r\nin adopting our national SDG 18, entitled “Lives Safe \r\nfrom UXO”, which was officially launched by our Prime \r\nMinister and former Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon in \r\nSeptember 2016 on the sidelines of the eighth ASEAN-\r\nUnited Nations summit in Vientiane. SDG 18 aims to \r\naddress specific development challenges caused by \r\nunexploded ordnance and mitigate its impacts on the \r\nlives of our people, which will pave the way for improving \r\nthe livelihood and well-being of the rural population \r\nand enabling them to contribute to the implementation \r\nof the Agenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nAs both a least developed country (LDC) and \r\na landlocked country, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic encounters various challenges that hinder \r\nour socioeconomic development and the achievement \r\nof our agreed global development goals. Against that \r\nbackdrop, the country has pursued its development \r\nthrough the implementation of our eighth five-year \r\nnational socioeconomic development plan. The Strategy \r\n2025 and the Vision 2030 are aimed at graduating \r\nfrom LDC status and becoming a high-middle-income \r\ncountry by 2030.\r\nTowards that end, the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic pursues a policy of transforming itself \r\nfrom a landlocked country into a land-linked hub, \r\nfacilitating direct connectivity between immediate \r\nneighbouring countries such as Viet Nam, Thailand \r\nand China, and the wider region. We hope to constitute \r\na part of the production and supply chains through \r\nthe implementation of infrastructure projects; the \r\nimprovement of logistics and transport networks, \r\nsuch as the construction of a high-speed railway from \r\nVientiane to Kunming, in southern China; and the \r\nimprovement of the north-south economic corridor \r\nand the east-west economic corridor, among others. \r\nThose national strategies are being implemented as \r\npart of international and regional initiatives under way, \r\nincluding the ASEAN Community Vision 2025, the \r\nASEAN Master Plan 2025 and China’s One Belt and \r\nRoad Initiative, of which the Lao People’s Democratic \r\nRepublic is a partner.\r\nI am of the view that political will is a fundamental \r\nprinciple for attaining all agreed development goals. \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n20/32 17-29807\r\nWithout firm political commitment, we will not be \r\nable to turn the Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\ninto concrete actions and outcomes. Therefore, my \r\ndelegation firmly believes that development remains \r\nan integral part of and a top priority for ensuring \r\ninternational peace, security and human rights, all of \r\nwhich are closely linked.\r\nAgainst that backdrop, we call on the international \r\ncommunity to increase concerted efforts to ensure that \r\ndevelopment brings equal benefits for all countries. \r\nThe Lao Government once again reaffirms its strong \r\ncommitment and determination to work more closely \r\nwith the international community in order to realize \r\nthe 2030 Agenda and achieve our national development \r\nobjectives of eradicating poverty, laying a solid \r\nfoundation for graduation from LDC status, turning the \r\ncountry into an industrialized and modern nation and \r\nmoving towards the direction of green and sustainable \r\ndevelopment that benefits all the people, thereby \r\nensuring that no one in the country is left behind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Simon Coveney, Minister for Foreign Affairs and \r\nTrade with responsibility for Brexit of Ireland.\r\nMr. Coveney (Ireland): Allow me to begin by \r\noffering Ireland’s sympathy to all those in Mexico \r\naffected by the devastating earthquake earlier this week \r\nand to commend those who have been engaged in the \r\nheroic rescue operations of the last few days. I also want \r\nto extend condolences to the representatives of people \r\nin the Caribbean islands, who are facing extraordinary \r\ndifficulties following the recent, relentless hurricanes.\r\nNow is no time for business as usual at the United \r\nNations. The international community is facing \r\nunprecedented challenges and must respond. I am here \r\nbecause I think that this Organization matters. It is \r\nan Organization that now faces daily challenges to its \r\npolitical authority and management missions.\r\nMy country, Ireland, has kept faith with the United \r\nNations since we joined as a young republic that had \r\nfought hard for its own independence and saw being \r\na Member of the United Nation as fundamental to \r\nits future and the future security of its people. Over \r\n60 years later, we still do. Our faith has not been \r\nmisplaced, and it is as strong today as ever. However, \r\nwe certainly have something to say about the future of \r\nthe Organization and the role we believe it must play \r\nin reducing suffering across the globe and securing a \r\nshared peace and security and prosperity for everybody.\r\nGiven our history as a small country, with its \r\nown troubled past, we see very clearly the advantages \r\nof a rules-based order in international affairs. It is \r\nbecause Ireland is small, outward-looking and heavily \r\ndependent on external trade for our own well-being \r\nthat we pursue an active foreign policy.\r\nAs Ireland’s experience in the European Union \r\nhas shown us, we are far stronger acting collectively \r\nthan we are acting alone. Partnership and cooperation \r\nhas brought peace and prosperity to the European \r\ncontinent. In fact, for Ireland, our membership of the \r\nEuropean Union, working closely with other member \r\nStates, has strengthened our independence and self-\r\nconfidence and security rather than diminished it. It is \r\ntherefore through collective actions that we reinforce \r\nour own security and well-being, which is what the \r\nUnited Nations needs to be all about.\r\nThe case for international cooperation and \r\nmultilateralism is compelling. By working together, we \r\nlay foundations of trust, align our perspectives more \r\nclosely and accept our differences more willingly. \r\nPerhaps most importantly, we build habits of cooperation \r\nthat better allow us to address the common threats and \r\nopportunities that we should be facing together.The \r\nalternatives — unilateralism, transactional diplomacy, \r\nprotectionism and confrontation — are not, in fact, \r\nviable at all. Their short-term populist appeal obscures \r\ntheir long-term cost. Surely we have learned that \r\nfrom history.\r\nWe are living in an era when local and global \r\nchallenges are intersecting with increasing force. \r\nToday’s problems do not carry passports or recognize \r\ninternational borders. There are no unilateral solutions \r\nto the vast majority of the global challenges that we \r\nface together. Local and regional issues, from climate \r\nchange, migration, armed conflict and hunger to the \r\ndestruction of the marine environment in certain parts \r\nof the world, often become global issues, including in \r\ncorners of the world that are far from the origins of \r\nthe problems.\r\nThe enormous scale of the challenges that face \r\nthe world might lead some to question whether \r\nmultilateralism and the United Nations are up to the \r\ntask. My response is that we can be, and we must be. \r\nWhen properly mobilized, when we pull together and \r\nmove from debating halls like this Hall to actually \r\ngetting things done on the ground, we can move \r\nmountains together. The United Nations delivers \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 21/32\r\nextraordinary results, such as the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change. The United Nations has led the global \r\neffort to eradicate smallpox, end apartheid, promote \r\narms control, save the lives of millions of children \r\nthrough UNICEF and protect our cultural heritage \r\nthrough UNESCO.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development \r\nis a stand-out recent achievement. The Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals (SDGs) have the power and \r\npotential to transform our world, addressing the root \r\ncauses of poverty, inequality and instability. However, \r\ntheir potential can be realized only through a strong and \r\nconfident multilateral system that empowers Member \r\nStates to reach the ambitious but necessary targets we \r\nhave set ourselves. Having played an important role in \r\nfacilitating agreement on the SDGs in 2015, Ireland is \r\ncommitted to their implementation, domestically and \r\nthrough our foreign policy.\r\nFailure should not be an option here. The United \r\nNations is the fulcrum upon which we can leverage \r\nthe change required. However, the walls dividing the \r\nthree pillars of the United Nations — development, \r\nhuman rights, and peace and security — have in the \r\npast impeded our efforts to accelerate sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In my view, the SDGs represent a \r\nfundamental breakthrough, recognizing the many \r\naspects of sustainable development that straddle those \r\npillars. As we move forward on implementation, we \r\nmust break down the Organization’s institutional silos, \r\nwhich sometimes hinder progress.\r\nSince we gathered here a year ago, we appointed \r\nAntónio Guterres as Secretary-General. Ireland \r\nbelieves that he has the skills, experience and, perhaps \r\nmost importantly, the compassion to do a very tough \r\nbut hugely important job. The difficult international \r\nenvironment demands, more than ever, brave and \r\nprincipled leadership. We welcome the clear direction \r\nthe Secretary-General is providing and the steps he is \r\ntaking to reform the Organization.\r\nWhile we, the Member States, have expressed \r\nconfidence that the Secretary-General has the abilities \r\nto lead the United Nations forward at a time when the \r\nworld is crying out for better multilateral engagement, \r\nwe must allow him to lead. It is very tempting for \r\nMember States, particularly large ones, to micromanage \r\nthe work of the Secretariat, but such an approach is \r\nlikely to impede and not enhance reform.\r\nHowever, it is not enough that only the internal \r\nmechanisms of the United Nations meet twenty-first \r\ncentury standards. United Nations political bodies must \r\nalso ref lect today’s world and realities. Nowhere is that \r\nmore evident than with regard to the composition of the \r\nSecurity Council. The Security Council does not ref lect \r\nthe world that has evolved since the United Nations was \r\nestablished in 1945. Quite plainly, we would be hard \r\npressed to find any entity, public or private, anywhere \r\nin the world that remains so untouched by the changes \r\nand realities of the world around it.\r\nVast areas of our world are either insufficiently \r\nrepresented or not represented at all on the Security \r\nCouncil. In our view, the need to increase the size of \r\nthe Council is clear. Ireland sees the obvious need for a \r\nmuch stronger African representation on the Council, \r\nso that there can be a greater African say in the Council \r\ndecisions that affect their continent. We would also \r\nfavour consideration of a designated seat for small \r\nisland developing States. Those changes are politically \r\ncontroversial, but we cannot ignore them forever.\r\nThe makeup of the Security Council is not the only \r\nproblem. Let us be clear and honest. While the use or \r\nthreat of the veto remains in place, as it does today, the \r\nwork of the Council is often impeded and the United \r\nNations can be paralysed in its capacity to respond to \r\nthe gravest crises facing the international community. \r\nThe failure of the Security Council to take action in \r\npreventing mass atrocity crimes — most recently with \r\nregard to Syria, but also on other occasions — betrays \r\nvictims and weakens the credibility of the Organization. \r\nThe case for reform is therefore not an academic \r\nor institutional question; it is a deeper question \r\nof fundamental legitimacy and effectiveness and \r\ncredibility for the United Nations in the future.\r\nAlthough geographically a small island on the \r\nperiphery of Europe, Ireland’s people and its outlook \r\nare global, inf luenced by connecting with people and \r\nevents around the world, as we do. In many ways \r\nIreland, like some of the other nations represented \r\nhere, is like a global tribe that extends far beyond our \r\nown island.\r\nNo part of our contribution to the United Nations \r\nresonates more with Irish people than our United \r\nNations peacekeepers — the thousands of men \r\nand women who have served under Blue Helmets, \r\nrepresenting Ireland, our people and values. They are \r\ntrue ambassadors. Since 1958, when Irish troops first \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n22/32 17-29807\r\nbegan serving the United Nations, not a single day has \r\npassed without Irish participation in United Nations \r\npeace-support operations. We believe that we are \r\nmaking a difference. Ireland’s peacekeepers have been \r\nnatural soldier-diplomats in trouble spots across the \r\nglobe, particularly in Africa and the Middle East, doing \r\nUnited Nations work day by day and deed by deed.\r\nToday, we have almost 550 troops in the field. \r\nIreland is the highest per capita European Union \r\ncontributor of troops to United Nations peacekeeping, \r\nwith deployments to six United Nations missions \r\nacross the Middle East and Africa. We are making a \r\nsubstantial contribution to the United Nations Interim \r\nForce in Lebanon in particular, where, as always, our \r\npeacekeepers act with impartiality and integrity and \r\nprovide the necessary leadership required in a very \r\ndifficult and challenging environment.\r\nI am pleased to note that Ireland is committed to \r\ndoubling the number of women in our defence forces — I \r\nwas the Minister for Defence when that decision was \r\nmade — with the aim also of significantly increasing \r\nfemale participation in peacekeeping, a demand of the \r\nSecretary-General. As the Secretary-General said at \r\nthe Security Council this week (see S/PV.8051), and \r\nas we know from the women and peace and security \r\nagenda, increased female participation leads to better \r\ndecision-making, improved situational awareness, a \r\nbetter focus on protection of civilians and enhanced \r\nreporting of and accountability for sexual exploitation \r\nand abuse.\r\nWe all know that conflict prevention has the \r\npotential to save lives and to protect hard-won \r\ndevelopment gains, and that it comes at a far lower \r\nfinancial cost than peacekeeping operations, post-\r\nconflict peacebuilding or, in some cases, State-building. \r\nWe strongly support the Secretary-General’s efforts to \r\nreorient the international community’s thinking toward \r\ncrisis and conflict prevention. Ireland seeks to share \r\nour own national experience and past in our work on \r\nconflict prevention, mediation and State-building. \r\nWe have made some mistakes, but we have also had \r\nsuccesses, and we would like others to share the lessons \r\nfrom that experience.\r\nAs the first State to sign the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in 1968, we \r\nhave a deep commitment to its full implementation. \r\nEarlier this week I was very pleased to sign the \r\nrecently approved Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, which was supported by 122 members of \r\nthis Assembly, and growing. Ireland is proud to have \r\nplayed a leadership role, together with Austria, Brazil, \r\nMexico, Nigeria and South Africa, in bringing forward \r\nthe Assembly resolution convening the diplomatic \r\nconference that negotiated this ground-breaking treaty.\r\nThe case for the complete elimination of nuclear \r\nweapons has never been stronger, as the volatile \r\nsituation on the Korean peninsula makes very clear \r\nthis week. I unreservedly condemn the recent series of \r\nmissile and nuclear weapons testing by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. These developments \r\nhighlight the urgent need for the swift and immediate \r\nentry into force of the Comprehensive Test-Ban \r\nTreaty. I understand that I will be followed today on \r\nthis rostrum by the representative of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic, and I would urge him to de-escalate \r\nthe provocative language and tensions of this week. \r\nThis is a conflict that the world does not need and must \r\nmove away from.\r\nThe scale and severity of humanitarian \r\ncrises is one of the greatest challenges facing the \r\ninternational community. Ireland is committed to \r\nproviding humanitarian assistance and contributing \r\nto international efforts to ease the plight of civilians \r\ncaught in conflicts in South Sudan, Syria, Yemen and \r\nIraq, to name but a few. As those large-scale crises \r\ndominate the headlines, Ireland is conscious of the \r\nmany forgotten or underfunded crises and the need to \r\nmaintain a focus on ensuring that human suffering, \r\nwherever it occurs in the world, is not ignored.\r\nThe vast majority of displaced people are being \r\nsheltered in communities that are already experiencing \r\nhigh levels of vulnerability and poverty, placing a \r\nhuge strain on already limited resources. Therefore \r\nIreland is supporting both refugees and vulnerable \r\nhost communities on the basis of need. I particularly \r\nwant to acknowledge the generosity of so many \r\nStates — such as Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey, Ethiopia, \r\nKenya, Uganda and many more — that are hosting \r\nvery large numbers of people displaced by conflicts in \r\nneighbouring countries.\r\nIreland is proud of its strong and targeted \r\ncontribution to eradicating global hunger, reducing \r\nextreme poverty, addressing conflict and instability \r\nand responding to humanitarian crises wherever they \r\noccur. It is horrifying to think that in 2017 we have \r\nfour famines affecting more than 20 million people, \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 23/32\r\n70 per cent of whom are children, and that we as an \r\ninternational community have allowed that to happen, \r\nknowing that it was on the way. For Ireland, strong \r\npartnerships, especially with least developed countries, \r\nwill remain at the core of our approach as we work \r\ntogether for a peaceful and prosperous future. We \r\napplaud the Secretary-General’s efforts to enhance \r\ncoherence, effectiveness and accountability, as well as \r\nthe delivery of results where it matters most — which \r\nis on the ground.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations does not begin \r\n“We the Member States” but rather “We the peoples”. \r\nOur policies and actions must ref lect the inherent \r\nequality of humankind at the core of our multilateral \r\nsystem. In practice, that means listening to and heeding \r\nthe voices of women, the voices of young people and \r\nthe voices of the marginalized. The women and peace \r\nand security agenda has had a hugely positive global \r\nimpact with the realization that we can create more \r\ndurable and sustainable peace by working to ensure that \r\nwomen play their rightful role in conflict prevention \r\nand peacebuilding efforts. Ireland will play our part, \r\nincluding as Chair of the Commission on the Status of \r\nWomen for the next two years.\r\nA similar strategic approach must also be taken \r\nin engaging young people in all our countries. Young \r\npeople must have a role in shaping a future that they will \r\nultimately inherit; otherwise, we are, on a generational \r\nbasis, robbing a future from them. We have a phrase in \r\nIrish that the interpreters will not be able to translate: \r\n“Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí”. Broadly translated, this \r\nmeans “Praise the youth and they will come”. I cannot \r\nthink of any continent where that is more relevant \r\ntoday than Africa. Young people are key to achieving \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals, and we must find \r\nways to encourage their active participation, again and \r\nagain and again, ensuring that they are part of shaping \r\nthe solutions for their future.\r\nThere are positive signs: the vitality of \r\nentrepreneurship, the creative use of technology, \r\ninfrastructure development, the potential of renewable \r\nenergy, increasing access to good education, \r\nimprovements in agricultural yields, adding value \r\nto commodities, and better prospects for women and \r\ngirls in politics and economic life. African countries \r\nare particularly affected by global challenges that lie \r\noutside their control in many ways, such as climate \r\nchange, conflict and food insecurity. Those issues \r\ncan be addressed only in their African contexts, in a \r\nspirit of effective global partnership. Such partnership \r\nrequires understanding local perspectives anchored in \r\nlocal experience, particularly regarding how to tackle \r\nroot causes.\r\nI want Ireland to play a leading role in Europe in \r\nhelping to build better and more effective partnerships \r\nwith the continent of Africa as a whole, rooted in \r\nshared interests and values and sustained over the \r\nmedium to long term on the basis of parity of esteem \r\nand equality. We need a new political architecture, in \r\nmy view, for the relationship between the European \r\nUnion and Africa, one that matches the urgency and \r\nscale of the shared challenges we know we are going \r\nto face over the next twenty years. We are in the same \r\nglobal neighbourhood, and we need to put structures in \r\nplace to treat each other as true neighbours.\r\nThe Middle East is also part of Europe’s close \r\nneighbourhood, and its challenges resonate deeply with \r\nthe people of Ireland. The conflicts in Syria and Yemen \r\nhave caused untold suffering. Ireland has responded \r\nas generously as we can with almost €100 million in \r\nhumanitarian aid, but what the people of Syria and \r\nYemen need most right now is peace to enable them to \r\nrebuild their lives and start the process of rebuilding \r\ntheir countries. I urge all sides in the two conflicts to \r\nwork for an end to violence and to engage in the search \r\nfor peaceful political solutions under United Nations \r\nauspices and for accountability for crimes committed.\r\nIreland is committed to constructive and principled \r\ndiplomatic action on the Middle East peace process. \r\nNext year will be the twenty-fifth anniversary of the \r\nsigning of the Oslo Accords. We cannot let ourselves \r\nbecome complacent about the status quo because the \r\nstatus quo is not acceptable, and we know where it \r\nis going. We cannot let our efforts to achieve peace \r\nstagnate either. Palestinians need an end to occupation, \r\nand Israelis need security. Continued construction of \r\nsettlements undermines both objectives, and we need \r\nto act on that. I wish the United States success in its \r\nefforts to build some momentum for peace and a new \r\npeace initiative for the first time in quite some time.\r\nIreland will give all the support it can to achieving \r\na two-State solution, which we remain convinced is \r\nthe only way to secure prosperity and security for both \r\npeoples. The time to act on this is now. We cannot \r\nbecome cynical or jaded. We owe it to all Palestinians \r\nand Israelis to continue to bring energy, resolve and \r\nideas to the table and help them finally deliver a lasting \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n24/32 17-29807\r\npeace, which would not only be good for both of those \r\npeoples, but also a welcome, if not a desperately needed, \r\npositive news story for the broader Middle East as well.\r\nIn relation to Myanmar, Ireland strongly condemns \r\nthe violence in Rakhine state that has driven hundreds \r\nof thousands from their homes into neighbouring \r\nBangladesh. Here at the General Assembly we have to \r\ninsist on an end to violence, to the upholding of the \r\nrule of law and the recognition of the right of return of \r\nall those who have been forced to leave their country. \r\nI know the situation is difficult — my friend from \r\nSingapore has highlighted its complexities — but we \r\nhave to ensure that standards are met.\r\nIreland sees itself as a natural child of the United \r\nNations. We are small. We are an island that has \r\nexperienced colonization and conflict, as many of us \r\nhere have also done. But here at the United Nations, we \r\nlisten to others, especially if we hold a different view \r\non an issue or a policy. We are convinced that in today’s \r\nglobalized world we must live in each other’s shelter \r\nand not in each other’s shadow.\r\nIreland’s contribution to the United Nations in \r\nthe fields of sustainable development, humanitarian \r\nassistance, disarmament, human rights and the rule of \r\nlaw has been steadfast. United Nations membership has \r\nbeen and will continue to be at the very heart of Irish \r\nforeign policy. Ireland is proud to be a candidate for a \r\nseat on the Security Council in the elections to be held \r\nin 2020. We have presented our candidature because \r\nwe believe deeply that we should step forward and \r\nplay our part in support of multilateralism at a time \r\nof significant global instability and realignment of \r\ngeopolitical inf luences.\r\nWe have something to say, and we will listen to \r\nothers when they speak. We will be courageous on \r\nbehalf of the United Nations when needed. With \r\nIreland, the world knows what it gets — a small country \r\nwith big thinking, a country that listens and a strong \r\nindependent voice that promotes the values that should \r\ninspire the Organization in future.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Ri Yong Ho, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nMr. Ri Yong Ho (Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea) (spoke in Korean; English text provided by the \r\ndelegation): First of all, allow me to congratulate His \r\nExcellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election as the \r\nPresident of the General Assembly at its seventy-second \r\nsession. I look forward to the successful outcome of \r\nthis session, which will unfold under his able guidance.\r\nBefore going into the main points in my remarks, \r\nI feel obligated to make comments on the speech made \r\nsome four days ago by someone called the United \r\nStates President, which tainted this sacred United \r\nNations forum (see A/72/PV.3). Since Trump uttered \r\nsuch reckless and violent words from this very rostrum, \r\nattacking the supreme dignity of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, I think it is fair for me to \r\nrespond in a corresponding tone.\r\nDuring his eight months in power, he has turned \r\nthe White House into a noisy marketplace filled with \r\nthe crackling sounds of abacus beads. Now he has tried \r\nto turn the United Nations forum into a gangster’s \r\nnest where only money is respected and bloodshed is \r\nthe order of the day. The absurd reality of a person \r\nlike Trump — a mentally deranged and complacent \r\nmegalomaniac, a person who is even chastised by some \r\nAmericans as “Commander-in-Grief”, “Lyin’ King” \r\nand “President Evil” — holding the office of President \r\nof the United States, and, indeed, the dangerous reality \r\nof an aging gambler using threats, fraud and every \r\nother type of schemes to acquire a patch of land having \r\nhis finger on the nuclear button, are what constitute the \r\ngravest threat to international peace and security today.\r\nDue to his lack of basic common knowledge and \r\nappropriate feelings, he has tried to insult the supreme \r\ndignity of my country by referring to its leader as \r\n“rocket man”. By doing so, however, he has committed \r\nthe irreversible error of making our rockets rain down \r\non the entire United States mainland all the more \r\ninevitable. No one other than Trump himself is on a \r\nsuicide mission. Should innocent lives in the United \r\nStates be harmed by his suicidal inclinations, Trump \r\nwill be held totally responsible.\r\nOur respected Supreme Leader Comrade Kim Jong \r\nUn responded to Trump’s statement:\r\n“As a man who represents the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and on behalf of the dignity \r\nand honour of my State and my people, and on \r\nmy own behalf, I will make the man holding the \r\nprerogative of the supreme command in the United \r\nStates pay dearly for his speech calling for the total \r\ndestruction of the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea.”\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 25/32\r\nTrump may not have been aware of what he uttered, \r\nbut we will make sure that he bears consequences \r\nfar beyond his words and far beyond the scope of \r\nwhat he can handle — even if he claims to be able to \r\nhandle anything.\r\nThe theme of the seventy-second session is \r\n“Focusing on people: Striving for peace and a decent \r\nlife for all on a sustainable planet”. For all countries and \r\npeoples to enjoy peace and a decent life, it is imperative \r\nthat genuine international justice be realized before \r\nanything else. Realizing international justice is one of \r\nthe principal missions of the United Nations.\r\nAs Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations \r\nstipulates, one of the purposes of the United Nations is\r\n“to bring about by peaceful means, and in \r\nconformity with the principles of justice and \r\ninternational law, adjustment or settlement of \r\ninternational disputes or situations which might \r\nlead to a breach of the peace”.\r\nHowever, due to the high-handedness and arbitrariness \r\nof one particular large Power, the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter and other established basic \r\nprinciples of international relations are at present \r\nbeing wantonly ignored in the United Nations arena. \r\nConspiracies to commit abnormal acts that justify or \r\nlegitimize high-handedness and arbitrariness or acts \r\nthat violate truth and justice are tolerated or supported.\r\nThe most f lagrant violation of international justice \r\ncan be seen in the handling of the situation on the \r\nKorean peninsula. Unprecedented acts of injustice, \r\nincluding harsh sanctions imposed on a victim that has \r\nchosen to stand up to an offender, are openly committed \r\nin the name of the United Nations. The essence of the \r\nsituation on the Korean peninsula is a confrontation \r\nbetween the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nand the United States, where the former is trying to \r\ndefend its national dignity and sovereignty against the \r\nlatter’s hostile policies and nuclear threats.\r\nThe United States is the country that first produced \r\nnuclear weapons and the only country to have actually \r\nused them, massacring hundreds of thousands of \r\ninnocent civilians. The United States threatened to \r\nuse nuclear weapons against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea during the Korean War in the \r\n1950s and first introduced nuclear weapons to the \r\nKorean peninsula after that war. The United States \r\nstarted large-scale joint military exercises against the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea during the \r\nCold War period and further intensified their scope \r\nand aggressive nature after the Cold War by staging \r\nthem more frequently — several times a year — and by \r\nmobilizing more strategic nuclear assets.\r\nWhat could be a bigger threat than the use of the \r\nwords “fire and fury” and “total destruction”, in the \r\nstatement made by the President of the world’s biggest \r\nnuclear Power? The United States is the very reason \r\nthat the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has \r\nto possess nuclear weapons. We have had to develop \r\nand strengthen our nuclear arsenal to current levels \r\nso that we could cope with the threats of that country. \r\nThe hostile policies and nuclear threats of the United \r\nStates have continued for over 70 years, which has led \r\nto a touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula. \r\nFurther, due to the high-handedness of the United \r\nStates, the United Nations has adopted unjustifiable \r\nresolutions that are the embodiment of injustice.\r\nOur respected Supreme Leader Comrade Kim Jong \r\nUn, Chairman of the Workers’ Party of Korea, Chairman \r\nof the State Affairs Commission of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, Supreme Commander of \r\nthe Korean People’s Army, has said that international \r\njustice is never achieved in a vacuum. Rather, it can \r\nbe achieved only when independent, anti-imperialist \r\ncountries are strong enough to demand it.\r\nAbsent true international justice, the only \r\nphilosophical principle that remains valid is that force \r\nmust be addressed with force. Nuclear weapons of \r\ntyranny must therefore be met with the nuclear hammer \r\nof justice. Pursuant to this principle, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea’s use of nuclear deterrence \r\nis a righteous act of self-defence, and a last resort.\r\nAs part of its efforts to achieve the goal of \r\nbecoming a nuclear-weapon State, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea recently conducted the \r\nsuccessful test of a hydrogen bomb that can be mounted \r\non an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). With \r\nthis step, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nis in the process of consolidating its status as a nuclear \r\nPower, consistent with its double aim of developing its \r\neconomy and its nuclear arsenal. For all intents and \r\npurposes, our nuclear weapons are a deterrent designed \r\nto put an end to the nuclear threat of the United States \r\nand to prevent a military invasion by that country. Our \r\nultimate goal is to establish a balance of power with the \r\nUnited States.\r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n26/32 17-29807\r\nEveryone present in this Hall today is aware that, \r\nat every stage in the development and growth of its \r\nnuclear arsenal, the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea, unlike other nuclear-weapon States, has never \r\nfailed to disclose its testing or the results of its testing. \r\nSince we have sufficiently strengthened our deterrent \r\nwith a view to safeguarding the peace and security of \r\nthe Korean peninsula and the region, the United States \r\nand its followers must now think twice before launching \r\na military provocation against the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea.\r\nAlthough the United States speaks of fire and fury \r\nand total destruction, inter alia, every time it makes \r\nsuch provocations it is compelled to use qualifiers such \r\nas “hopefully that will not be necessary” or “that is \r\nnot our first option” and so on. Accordingly, we are \r\nconvinced that our actions have helped to consolidate \r\nthe peace and security of North-East Asia and the \r\nregion as a whole as much as possible.\r\nWe do not need anyone else to recognize our \r\nstatus as a nuclear-weapon State or our nuclear-strike \r\ncapability. As it f lew through the endless blue sky in the \r\nrecent ballistic test, our ICBM etched the sacred name \r\nof the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea across \r\nthe universe. The rocket’s warhead left its trace on the \r\nblue waves of the Pacific Ocean, and the tremendous \r\nexplosion and vibrations caused by the hydrogen \r\nbomb were recorded all over the planet. Although our \r\ndecision to opt for possession of nuclear weapons was \r\nforced upon us by the United States, it has resulted in \r\nour country achieving the status of a nuclear-weapon \r\nState and a rocket-possessing Power. The attendant \r\nprestige has become a part of the immortal destiny of \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nThe failure of the United Nations to fulfil its role \r\nof realizing genuine international justice is a primary \r\nresult of the undemocratic and antiquated practices \r\nof the Security Council. For it is none other than the \r\nSecurity Council that disregards the Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations and acts only to satisfy the will and \r\ninterests of its permanent members. It is not a trivial \r\ndetail that the issue of Security Council reform was \r\nraised as early as 1992, at the forty-seventh session \r\nof the General Assembly, in resolution 47/62. Since \r\nthen, the issue of Security Council reform has been \r\ndiscussed at the General Assembly every year for the \r\npast 25 years, without any progress whatsoever. It is \r\ntherefore clear how deeply the current permanent \r\nmembers are fixated on their anachronistic vested \r\ninterests. One permanent member alone can veto the \r\ngeneral will of over 190 States Members of the United \r\nNations, which is a testament to how undemocratic the \r\nSecurity Council is.\r\nIn this Hall today, I would like once again to \r\nreiterate the unjust and unfair nature of the resolutions \r\nadopted by the Security Council against the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea. First of all, relying on a \r\ndouble standard, the Security Council has adopted \r\nillegal resolutions that prohibit the launch of satellites \r\nby the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Such \r\nprohibition violates international law, which provides \r\nfor the peaceful use of outer space as a sovereign right \r\nof every State. The Security Council takes no issue \r\nwith any other satellite-launching countries.\r\nSecondly, also in reliance on a double standard, \r\nthe Security Council has adopted illegal resolutions \r\nthat arbitrarily prohibit nuclear tests by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea, despite the fact that nuclear \r\ntesting is the strict sovereign right of every State, since \r\nthe international law on the prohibition of nuclear \r\ntesting has not yet entered into force. In addition, other \r\ncountries have conducted far more nuclear tests than \r\nwe have.\r\nThirdly, the Security Council has condemned the \r\ndevelopment of nuclear weapons by the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea as a threat to international \r\npeace and security and, on that basis, once again relying \r\non a double standard, has fabricated illegal resolutions \r\nthat contravene Article 51 of the Charter of the United \r\nNations, which recognizes every State’s right to self-\r\ndefence. The Security Council has taken such action \r\nwithout calling into question other countries that \r\ncontinue to develop nuclear weapons of various kinds.\r\nThe reason that those unjust and unfair resolutions \r\ncontinue to be adopted is that the permanent members \r\nof the Security Council — all nuclear Powers — have \r\na shared interest in maintaining their monopoly on \r\nnuclear status. The permanent members of the Security \r\nCouncil often talk of the non-proliferation of \r\nnuclear weapons. However, in the context of nuclear \r\nnon-proliferation, the Democratic People’s Republic \r\nof Korea’s possession of nuclear weapons is a justified \r\nmeasure of self-defence. Indeed, the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) was made \r\npossible because nuclear-weapon States had promised \r\nnot to threaten non-nuclear-weapon States with their \r\nnuclear arsenals. Article X of the NPT stipulates that \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 27/32\r\neach party shall have the right to withdraw from the \r\nTreaty if it decides that its supreme interests have been \r\njeopardized. This Article recognizes that the supreme \r\ninterests of States supersede nuclear non-proliferation. \r\nIn the end, the United States has itself impeded \r\ninternational efforts aimed at nuclear non-proliferation \r\nby refusing to give up making nuclear threats against \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. Rather, its \r\nbehaviour has compelled the latter to strive to possess \r\nnuclear weapons.\r\nThe foregoing eloquently demonstrates that the \r\nresolutions adopted to constrain the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea are not based on any \r\nestablished principle, but are simply the product of the \r\nundemocratic and antiquated practices of the Security \r\nCouncil and the conspiracy and collusion of forces that \r\nare obsessed with their own interests alone. The United \r\nStates makes the claim, even here at the United Nations, \r\nthat the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea’s \r\npossession of hydrogen bomb and intercontinental \r\nballistic missiles constitutes a global threat. However, \r\nsuch a claim is a big lie tantamount to the notorious \r\nbig lie conjured up by the United States in 2003 about \r\nthe existence of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq in \r\norder to justify invading that country.\r\nThe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea \r\nis a responsible nuclear-weapon State. We will \r\ntake preventive measures in the form of merciless \r\npre-emptive action in the event that the United States \r\nor its vassal forces show any sign of undertaking any \r\nsort of decapitating operation on our headquarters or \r\nother military attack against our country. However, \r\nwe have no intention whatsoever to use or threaten \r\nto use nuclear weapons against the countries that do \r\nnot join in a United States military action against the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea.\r\nThe United States is resorting to intrigue when \r\nit condemns the Democratic People’s Republic of \r\nKorea’s possession of nuclear weapons as a global \r\nthreat. It is simply using that fact as a pretext for \r\ncoercing other States Members of the United Nations \r\ninto implementing the sanctions resolutions against \r\nthe Democratic People’s Republic of Korea. It is a \r\nsneaky and selfish attempt by the United States to shirk \r\nits responsibility on the nuclear issue on the Korean \r\npeninsula and pursue its own interests by using and \r\nsacrificing other countries that have nothing to do with \r\nthe issue.\r\nThe Government of the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea requested the United Nations \r\nSecretariat to organize a forum of international law \r\nexperts to assess the legal grounds and lawfulness of \r\nthe Security Council resolutions, but we have had no \r\nresponse for nine months. Previously, the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea had made repeated requests \r\nto the Security Council to discuss the serious threat \r\nto international peace and security posed by the \r\nlarge-scale, aggressive and provocative joint military \r\nexercises undertaken by the United States and South \r\nKorea, but each of these requests was turned down \r\nand the issue has never been put on the Security \r\nCouncil’s agenda.\r\nThe Charter of the United Nations stipulates that \r\nMembers of the United Nations accept and carry out \r\nthe decisions of the Security Council. If the resolutions \r\non the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea adopted \r\nat the Security Council were truly lawful and fair, there \r\nwould be no need at all for United States ambassadors \r\nabroad, and even the United States President and \r\nthe Secretary of State, to coerce other countries into \r\nimplementing the resolutions. Furthermore, the United \r\nStates would not have to bring its stooges, for example, \r\nSouth Korea and Japan, into the matter.\r\nThe States Members of the United Nations should \r\nnot give in to pressure exerted by an individual major \r\nPower on implementing Security Council resolutions. \r\nRather, they should make an independent judgment \r\non the legality, impartiality and morality of such \r\nresolutions and contribute to promoting Security \r\nCouncil reform by further raising their voices against \r\nhigh-handedness and arbitrariness.\r\nThe United States imposed sanctions on our country \r\nfrom the very first day that it was founded, and the \r\nhistory of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, \r\nwhich spans more that 70 years, is in a sense a history \r\nof struggle where its people have had to persevere on \r\nthe road of self-development despite being under the \r\nworld’s harshest sanctions. Through such a prolonged \r\narduous struggle, we are at last only a few steps away \r\nfrom the final stage of completing the State’s nuclear \r\nforce. The possibility that the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea might be shaken an inch or change \r\nits stance as a result of harsher sanctions imposed by \r\nhostile forces is a vain hope.\r\nIn the near future, the day will certainly come \r\nwhen we will settle the account for all damages caused \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n28/32 17-29807\r\nto our peaceful economic development and to the \r\nimprovement of our people’s lives. All of the sufferings \r\nof our innocent women, children and elderly caused by \r\nthe heinous and barbaric sanctions against our Republic \r\nwill one day be redressed. The Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea has established a Sanctions Damage \r\nInvestigation Committee to make a comprehensive \r\nstudy of the total damages inflicted on our Republic by \r\nall forms of sanctions. The Committee will thoroughly \r\ninvestigate and compile all physical and moral damage \r\nimposed on my country by the United States and its \r\nfollowers, including by those that have submitted to \r\nUnited States coercion. When the pressure caused \r\nby this sanctions racket reaches a critical point and \r\ndrives the Korean peninsula into an uncontrollable \r\nsituation, the investigation results of this Committee \r\nwill provide an evidentiary basis for holding those \r\nresponsible accountable.\r\nMy delegation takes this opportunity to extend \r\nits strong support to and solidarity with the Cuban \r\nGovernment and the people who are fighting to defend \r\ntheir national sovereignty and realize international \r\njustice against the high-handedness and arbitrariness \r\nin the form of the unilateral embargo by the United \r\nStates. We also express strong support to and solidarity \r\nwith the Government and the people of Venezuela, who \r\nare fighting to defend their national sovereignty and \r\nthe cause of socialism.\r\nSuch unjust and contemptible acts as the turning of \r\na blind eye to Israel’s heinous acts while condemning in \r\nevery possible way the Syrian Government for fighting \r\nto protect its national sovereignty and security should \r\nno longer be tolerated.\r\nIn conclusion, the Government of the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea will defend its national \r\npeace and security using its powerful nuclear deterrent \r\nand will contribute to safeguarding world peace \r\nand security.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ibrahim Abulkarim Al-Jafari, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Iraq.\r\nMr.  Al-Jafari (Iraq) (spoke in Arabic): \r\nMy delegation first wishes to congratulate \r\nMr. Miroslav Lajčák upon his election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nWe also congratulate the Republic of Slovakia and \r\nwish Mr. Lajčák the greatest success in this role. We \r\nalso thank his predecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his \r\nefforts and wise leadership in guiding the work of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session.\r\nWe wish to express our condolences to the victims \r\nof the natural disasters that have struck the United \r\nStates of America, Mexico and other States in the \r\nCaribbean region.\r\nThe heroic Iraqi forces won a historic victory that \r\nput an end to the myth of the extremist-terrorist State \r\nin Mosul. Through their great sacrifices and with the \r\nassistance of brother countries, the valiant Iraqi forces \r\nrecaptured the city of Mosul. The Iraqi Armed Forces \r\nare fighting several towns, including Tal Afar, which \r\nhas just been liberated. They have also contributed, \r\nthrough all their branches, to shutting down all terrorist \r\nhotbeds in certain other Iraqi cities, such as Hawija.\r\nI therefore wish today to congratulate our Armed \r\nForces and our proud people who made many sacrifices. \r\nI hail all honourable members of the civilized world \r\nwho supported Iraq and its brave forces in the fight \r\nagainst the terrorist bands from the Islamic State \r\nin Iraq and the Levant, also known as Da’esh. We \r\nscored a major victory without shirking our duty to \r\nprotect civilians, who were used as human shields by \r\nterrorists, or failing to respect the unity, sovereignty \r\nand the territorial integrity of Iraq. All branches of \r\nthe Iraqi Armed Forces, the Iraqi police, the Popular \r\nMobilization Forces, the Peshmerga forces and other \r\nanti-terrorist forces contributed to this historic victory.\r\nIt is also a victory for the entire world. Even \r\nthough the war had been raging in Iraq, it affected a \r\nvast number peaceful of citizens in some 120 other \r\nStates. History teaches us that post-conflict periods \r\ncan be even more challenging than wartime. Indeed, \r\nefforts to restore stability, undertake reconstruction \r\nand resurrect hope after the liberation of Iraqi cities, \r\nthrough great sacrifices on the humanitarian and \r\ndevelopment fronts and the environment, which \r\ndeteriorated badly. Moreover, Da’esh also conducted \r\nenvironmental terrorism by setting fire to oil wells, \r\ndestroying small dams and f looding agricultural lands. \r\nIt has also destroyed our cultural heritage sites.\r\nToday, Iraq is entering a new phase in its just fight \r\nagainst Da’esh bands to respond to the challenges of the \r\npost-Da’esh period, including the financial challenges \r\nof lower oil prices on international markets. We have \r\ndeveloped a comprehensive vision for our future that is \r\nbased on social, economic and security priorities that \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 29/32\r\nserve Iraq and its citizens. This vision comprises the \r\nfollowing main axes. \r\nFirst, we are restoring security, stability and basic \r\nservices, allowing people to return to their homes \r\nand participate in the reconstruction of all that was \r\ndestroyed by Da’esh, and caring for the families of the \r\nmartyrs and victims who paid the ultimate price in \r\ndefending our State. Also, we are caring for the victims \r\nof terrorism, rehabilitating societies so that no  trace \r\nremains of Da’esh or the culture of hatred and violence, \r\nmobilizing all national efforts to achieve those national \r\nand humanitarian objectives.\r\nSecond, we are ensuring respect and peaceful \r\ncoexistence among all members of society, regardless \r\nof religion, ideology or intellectual affiliation. We have \r\nfostered a spirit of confidence and mutual trust among \r\nour citizens and are protecting minorities and houses \r\nof worship of all religions, which is the basis for social \r\nreconciliation.\r\nThird, we will prevent the return of the abnormal \r\npractices and phenomena that were present in Iraq \r\nbefore Da’esh took control of parts of the country, in \r\nparticular, the sectarian and nationalist isolationism \r\nthat were to detrimental to the best interests of the State. \r\nSuch phenomena made it possible for Da’esh to take \r\nover cities and control governorates. We will appeal \r\nto the population’s spirit of citizenship and desire for \r\nunity and cooperation, so that neither Da’esh nor any \r\nother terrorist organization can return to Iraq by giving \r\ncoverage or protection in the areas we have retaken.\r\nFourth, we believe that it is important to foster \r\na spirit of good-neighbourliness based on the shared \r\ninterests of all States and work according to our \r\nnational will and independent decision-making. We \r\nwill not give in to foreign pressure.\r\nFifth, we will keep arms exclusively in the hands of \r\nour national security forces, putting an end to all armed \r\nincidents and reviving the rule of law in all sectors of \r\nthe State.\r\nSixth, we will continue our formidable fight against \r\ncorruption in all of its forms and manifestations, \r\nbecause it is fertile ground for terrorism and crime.\r\nSeventh, State institutions must be sheltered \r\nfrom political interference and favouritism in order \r\nto foster justice and equal opportunities and to attract \r\nhighly specialized professionals into the public-\r\nsector workforce.\r\nIraq is a united, independent and sovereign federal \r\nState. It is a State based on a federal Constitution adopted \r\nin 2005 by Iraqis from all components of society in a \r\ntransparent and democratic referendum that enjoyed a \r\nhigh degree of participation. The Constitution respects \r\nall rights and obligations of all components of Iraqi \r\nsociety and reinforces the value of citizen participation \r\nin democratic political processes and effective political \r\nrepresentation in all ministries and independent \r\nbodies. Attention has been paid to making it possible \r\nfor all parties concerned to exercise their rights and \r\nresponsibilities and participate in political, social, \r\ncultural and linguistic events — something that is \r\nlacking in many ethnically and religiously diversified \r\nstates. The Government of Iraq continues to encourage \r\ncohesiveness among all members of society.\r\nWith regard to the relationship between the \r\nfederal Government and the Regional Government \r\nof Kurdistan, the Government is promoting and will \r\ncontinue to promote constructive dialogue to resolve \r\nall outstanding issues with the Regional Government \r\nof Kurdistan, without preconditions. We have not \r\naccepted the unconstitutional decision adopted by the \r\nIraqi Kurdistan region, nor will we abandon Iraq’s \r\nunity, which is guaranteed by the Constitution. The \r\nNational Assembly and its representatives, in the \r\ninterests of Iraq’s unity, voted to reject the so-called \r\nreferendum. It mandated the national Iraqi Government \r\nto take measures to preserve the country’s unity and \r\naddress the pending issue, based on Article 1 of the \r\nConstitution, which stipulates that the unity of Iraq is \r\none and its sovereignty is indivisible. The Government, \r\nin conformity with its responsibilities, has asked the \r\nSupreme Court to issue an order rejecting the so-called \r\nreferendum, which is supposed to be held in Kurdistan \r\non 25 September. It is a violation of the Constitution, \r\nparticularly with respect to the status of disputed \r\nregions characterized by  multinationalism  and a \r\nmulti-religious frame of mind.\r\nIn the first three months of next year, Iraq will \r\norganize legislative and parliamentary elections. All \r\npolitical forces in the country have already begun to \r\nprepare for these elections. Through this democratic \r\nprocess, Iraq’s pluralist political system will be \r\nstrengthened, thereby ensuring the political stability \r\nthat will protect Iraq against future crises. These \r\nsuccesses will also make it possible to consolidate \r\neconomic progress and the implementation of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development in the country.\r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n30/32 17-29807\r\nWith regard to our relations with the United \r\nNations, we are working with all stakeholders to address \r\npending issues in the Security Council, with a view to \r\nbeing released from the burden of commitments made \r\nby previous Iraqi Governments. We have done this \r\ngradually, duly respecting international obligations, so \r\nthat Iraq can resume the status it had enjoyed before the \r\nadoption of resolution 661 (1990).\r\nIraq’s deeply held sense of responsibility has \r\nincluded respecting Security Council resolutions \r\non it and on relations between Iraq and Kuwait. We \r\nhave taken all of the necessary measures to implement \r\nresolution 1958 (2010) on the Oil-for-Food Programme. \r\nWe still face the issue of Kuwait’s compensation. \r\nNegotiations with our Kuwaiti brothers have begun to \r\nsettle the issue.\r\nOn 21 September, the Security Council adopted \r\nthe historic resolution 2379 (2017) to collect evidence \r\non the criminal activities perpetrated by Da’esh in Iraq \r\nand other States. This resolution establishes a joint \r\ninvestigative mechanism that will comprise judges, \r\nprosecutors and Iraqi’s criminal experts, working with \r\ninternational experts to collect, compile and preserve \r\nevidence against Da’esh in Iraq. We are doing our \r\nutmost to ensure that Da’esh is brought to justice for \r\nthe crimes it committed in Iraq, especially genocide, \r\nwar crimes and crimes against humanity. Resolution \r\n2379 (2017) is based on the essential pillars of respect \r\nfor Iraqi sovereignty and legal jurisdiction when it \r\ncomes to the collection of evidence of crimes Da’esh \r\nhas committed. We appeal to Member States to provide \r\nthe necessary financial resources and other forms of \r\nsupport to the joint investigative team.\r\nFrom this rostrum, Iraq calls for assistance from \r\nkindred nuclear-power countries to build a nuclear \r\nreactor for peaceful purposes in our country. Iraq \r\nwishes to acquire nuclear technology and relaunch \r\nvarious technological sectors on the basis of the right of \r\nStates to develop nuclear power for peaceful purposes, \r\nin accordance with article IV of the Treaty on the \r\nNon-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, which provides \r\nthat States, particularly developing countries, have the \r\ninalienable right to pursue research and develop and \r\nuse nuclear energy for peaceful purposes without any \r\ndiscrimination whatsoever.\r\nMy country’s Government takes note of the \r\nthreats to peace, security, stability and development \r\nthroughout the world, which calls for a dialogue \r\nbetween the various cultures and civilizations. Events \r\nin a number of geographic regions reaffirm the \r\nimportance of reinforcing the culture of peace and \r\nstrengthening its place on the General Assembly’s \r\nagenda, especially since Member States have adopted \r\nSustainable Development Goal 16, on peaceful and \r\ninclusive societies.\r\nPeaceful coexistence among peoples and \r\ncommunities cannot take place without tolerance, \r\nbecause tolerance is the surest way of establishing \r\nmodern communities, strengthening social linkages \r\nand enriching exchanges among various societies. \r\nWe cannot dispute the fact that the best way of \r\nre-establishing lasting peace and tolerance and \r\nfor strengthening sustainable development is by \r\nensuring that there are equal chances for everybody \r\nand a fair distribution of national resources, without \r\ndiscriminating on the basis of race or religion.\r\nNor can we overlook the role of religious and social \r\nleaders to spread the culture of peace in our countries, \r\nfor all religions call for peace and peaceful coexistence. \r\nIn this regard, I would like to make reference to the \r\nrole in Najaf of Mr. Al-Sistani, who contributed several \r\ntimes to putting an end to the divisions that had so \r\nseverely affected Iraq.\r\nThe adoption of the Takfiri school programme \r\nand the dissemination of erroneous Takfiri fatwas \r\nthrough the social media led to extremist intellectual \r\nand ideological aberrations that facilitated terrorism \r\nin all its forms and manifestations. It imposed a set of \r\nmistaken ideas that threaten international peace and \r\nsecurity and human civilization, hence the importance \r\nof working with UNESCO and other stakeholders to \r\nsend a message that appropriate education is essential \r\nfor spreading the values of tolerance and for rejecting \r\nextremism and violence.\r\nThe Government of Iraq has made security efforts \r\nto re-establish peace and security by adopting a project \r\nfor national reconciliation in order to strengthen \r\ncohesion and unity among the Iraqi people, entrench the \r\nprinciples of national unity, and create the appropriate \r\nconditions for love and harmony among all components \r\nof Iraqi society, while deepening the spirit of citizenship \r\nfor the sake of the country. Accordingly, all Iraqis have \r\nan equal footing in society, free from any discrimination \r\nwhatsoever, with a view to strengthening the sense of \r\nnational unity, responding to challenges and providing \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.20\r\n17-29807 31/32\r\nthe Iraqi people with everything they need to achieve \r\ndevelopment and prosperity.\r\nOur region has had to face great waves of \r\ndisplacement as a result of worsening crises that have \r\nled to the rapid deterioration of the humanitarian \r\nsituation of the displaced. Host countries are no longer \r\nable to provide sufficient assistance on their own. The \r\ncrisis has become even more complex in Iraq because \r\nof the increased number of displaced Iraqis who f led \r\nareas that had been under Da’esh control, which is \r\nan additional burden for the people of Iraq, who are \r\nalready suffering from a financial crisis stemming \r\nfrom the drop in oil prices and the growth of military \r\nspending to counter terrorism.\r\nWe therefore reaffirm the importance of \r\nintensifying international efforts aimed at settling the \r\nissue of displaced people and provide the necessary \r\nfinancial resources, in order to alleviate the suffering \r\nof Iraqi displaced persons. We are undertaking ongoing \r\nefforts to strengthen our relations with Arab States \r\nand other States in the region, including Saudi Arabia, \r\nKuwait, Jordan, Syria, Turkey and Iran. Once again, \r\nwe reaffirm that an equitable, sustainable peace is the \r\nbest strategic choice and that the peace process must \r\nbe comprehensive.\r\nPeace in our region is impossible without \r\nthe complete withdrawal of Israel from occupied \r\nPalestinian Arab lands and the full establishment of \r\na Palestinian State, with Jerusalem as its capital and \r\nwithin the pre-June 1967 borders. The Palestinian \r\nquestion is a priority for Iraq. We will therefore spare \r\nno effort in supporting the Palestinian people so that \r\nthey can enjoy their legitimate right to establish a \r\nPalestinian State. We reject all international policies \r\nthat run counter to the two-State solution or undermine \r\ninitiatives that could resolve the question of Palestine.\r\nWith respect to the situation in Syria, our position \r\nhas been clear since the crisis there began in 2011. \r\nOur position is based on a call for a political solution \r\nrather than a military one. We have adopted a policy of \r\nnon-interference in the internal affairs of other States. \r\nIraq supports efforts to find a peaceful solution to the \r\ncrisis in Syria in order to protect our Syrian brothers \r\nand sisters and preserve the unity of Syrian territory. \r\nWe have opted for a political solution that would settle \r\nall of the issues in the Middle East, including the issues \r\nof Yemen and Libya. The genocide of the suffering \r\nRohingya people in Rakhine state in Myanmar, which \r\nhas been perpetrated by the armed forces of that \r\ncountry, calls for a firm international humanitarian \r\neffort to meet the challenge of the scope of the human \r\nrights violations and other crimes, which have been \r\ndescribed in the report of the United Nations High \r\nCommissioner for Human Rights.\r\nWe would like to thank all countries participating \r\nin the Global Coalition, especially the United States, \r\nthe European Union and other countries outside the \r\nCoalition, for their efforts against terrorism and for \r\ntheir logistics and military support to Iraqi forces \r\nin the framework of respect for the sovereignty and \r\nterritorial integrity of my country. We need help from \r\nthe international community to rebuild the liberated \r\nareas as quickly as possible. As a result of the war \r\non terrorism, other Iraqi governorates have faced the \r\nsuspension of reconstruction projects and development \r\nopportunities. That needs to be included in the \r\nreconstruction campaign. \r\nWe see in the liberated cities many suffering women \r\nand children. We called on the international community \r\nto actively participate in the donor conference that will \r\nbe organized in Kuwait early next year. We would like \r\nto thank Kuwait for all its efforts to support Iraq and to \r\nrelieve the burden that the displaced have had to carry. \r\nFurthermore, we attach great importance to \r\nfreeing our society from the culture of hatred, murder \r\nand isolation disseminated by Da’esh. We are working \r\nto counter the effects of these practices. We need the \r\ninternational community, through our foreign partners, \r\nto assist us in form of consultation and financial \r\ninvestment. Once again, we call for partnerships with \r\ncompanies in our friendly countries in investing in the \r\nareas of the economy, energy, housing, transportation, \r\nhealth, and the building of hospitals and schools. We \r\nare providing a legislative environment conducive to \r\nattracting companies and investors.\r\nI would like to express Iraq’s thanks to its armed \r\nforces for the sacrifices they have made. These armed \r\nforces have fought and continue to fight against Da’esh, \r\nwhether they be forces of the Peshmerga, the army, \r\nthe police or anti-terrorist forces. Indeed, Da’esh was \r\nunable to control the south of the country — it controlled \r\nonly Mosul and Salah al-Din. However, the people \r\nof the south also participated in the struggle against \r\nDa’esh in Salah al-Din, Mosul, Anbar, Najaf and all \r\nother provinces, including Kirkuk and Diwaniyah. The \r\nA/72/PV.20 23/09/2017\r\n32/32 17-29807\r\npeople of the south of Iraq participated in that historic \r\nbattle against terrorism, sacrificing their own lives.\r\nI would like to express our thanks to the Iraqi people \r\nfor that sacrifice. I am very grateful to all parties, \r\nincluding the Peshmerga, the popular mobilization \r\nforces and anti-terrorist forces. We hope that we will \r\nbe able to achieve peace, security and prosperity, both \r\neconomically and socially, for all States and peoples. \r\nWe hope to obtain cooperation at all levels and in all \r\nsectors to achieve a world that is free of terrorism \r\nand corruption.\r\nThe meeting rose at 3.10 p.m.\r\n"
