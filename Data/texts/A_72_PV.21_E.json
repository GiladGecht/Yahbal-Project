"United Nations A/72/PV.21\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n21st plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 23 September 2017, 3 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nIn the absence of the President, Mr. Tevi (Vanuatu), \r\nVice-President, took the Chair.\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 3.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Osman Mohammed Saleh, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs of the State of Eritrea.\r\nMr. Saleh (Eritrea): It is another year and another \r\nsession of the General Assembly. We meet in the same \r\nAssembly Hall and deliver our addresses from the same \r\nrostrum, yet no modicum of protocol can mask the \r\ngaping divide in our ranks. We live in an increasingly \r\nfragile, unjust and unequal world. A small minority \r\nholds the reins of power and wealth among nations and, \r\nfor the most part, within nations. The overwhelming \r\nmajority of nations and their citizens are without power, \r\nwithout voice, without the means for a decent life, and \r\noften without peace and security. We may be called the \r\nUnited Nations, but the reality is that we are divided \r\nnations and societies. \r\nDespite our deep divisions, however, our destinies \r\nare intertwined in a fundamental way. We share a \r\ncommon home: a small planet in a vast universe, a \r\ntiny boat in a vast ocean. Whatever calamity happens \r\nanywhere in our world — epidemics, poverty, violence, \r\nmass displacement, war, terror — it will eventually \r\ncatch up with all of us.\r\nWe share the responsibility to address the \r\nfundamental problems of our common world. \r\nCertainly, the mighty and wealthy should shoulder \r\nbigger responsibility, as they command vast power and \r\nresources. It is only fair that more is asked of those to \r\nwhom much has been given — or, more accurately, \r\nthose who have appropriated much for themselves. We \r\nshould unflaggingly remind them of their obligations \r\nand press them not for charity, but for enlightened self-\r\ninterest that understands that might is not permanent \r\nand that only shared benefits are sustainable. \r\nWe would, however, be gravely mistaken and \r\nwould have forgotten the lessons of history if we pinned \r\nall our hopes on the goodwill of those who currently \r\nenjoy disproportionate power, wealth and influence. \r\nPower does not readily concede its privileges of its \r\nown accord. It resorts to deception, coercion, pressure, \r\nsanctions, violence and war to maintain and, if possible, \r\nincrease its privileges. \r\nThe developing countries and the marginalized \r\npeoples of the globe stand to gain most from a more \r\npeaceful, secure, just and equal world. They owe it to \r\nthemselves and to coming generations to build solidarity \r\nand to steadfastly strive and work and innovate for a \r\nbetter world. It is their duty to ensure freedom, dignity \r\nand prosperity for their peoples.\r\nAfrica remains the most marginalized of all \r\ncontinents. Undoubtedly, there is some progress, \r\nmore in some countries than in others. But talk of an \r\nAfrican Renaissance, of fastest-growing economies, \r\nis misplaced and premature.

Africa remains \r\na producer and small-bit exporter of primary products. \r\nIt retains minimum revenue from those exports, with \r\nforeign companies getting the lion’s share. Processing \r\nof primary products, value addition, industrialization \r\nand technology development barely exist. African \r\neconomies, physical and social infrastructure, \r\ninstitutional and governance structures, and peace and \r\nsecurity architectures remain undeveloped. \r\nYet Africa boasts tremendous human and natural \r\nresources. Indeed, over 60 per cent of global natural \r\nresources lie in Africa. It is only when Africa’s \r\neconomies, the quality of its infrastructure, the \r\nstandards of its health and educational institutions, \r\nthe level of its artistic, scientific and technological \r\nproducts, the effectiveness of its institutions and \r\nenterprises and, more importantly, the quality of life \r\nof its citizens reflect more accurately its great potential \r\nthat we can rightly speak of Africa taking its rightful \r\nplace in the world. We should safeguard independence \r\nand sovereignty, fight ethnic polarization and rampant \r\ncorruption, chart our own paths, develop bold and \r\nimaginative policies that suit our conditions, rely \r\nmainly on our own resources and build an Africa that \r\nmeets the aspirations of its people and makes valuable \r\ncontributions to humankind.\r\nEritrea is a young, strategically located nation \r\nwith significant human and natural resources. It joined \r\nthe community of independent nations a quarter of a \r\ncentury ago by dint of its people’s 30-year struggle for \r\nfreedom and self-determination, fought and won against \r\ntremendous odds. As an independent nation, it has \r\nfaced the full brunt of an unfair and unjust international \r\norder. It has faced demonization, ostracism, sanctions \r\nand armed aggression, and that sustained external \r\nhostility caused much harm to Eritrea and its people. \r\nIt slowed down Eritrea’s progress, but it was not able \r\nto stop it. It could not shake the resolve of the Eritrean \r\npeople and their Government. Eritrea was severely \r\ntested but emerged intact, more determined, more \r\nexperienced and in many ways stronger. It is peaceful, \r\nstable, secure and harmonious: a haven of stability in a \r\nturbulent neighbourhood.\r\nEritrea is, quietly and without fanfare, engaged in \r\ncomprehensive nation-building. It is pursuing policies \r\nand taking concrete measures to strengthen the unity \r\nand harmony of its people, fostering their political \r\nparticipation and unleashing their energies and talents. \r\nIt is laying the groundwork for broad-based and \r\nsustainable economic development. It is putting modern \r\ninfrastructure in place, step by step. It is working to \r\nensure that all its citizens get good access to nutritious \r\nfood, clean water, electricity, shelter, transport, \r\ncommunications, health care and educational services, \r\nas well as cultural, sports and recreational facilities.\r\nEritrea has also embarked on a massive water and \r\nsoil conservation programme and an afforestation \r\nprogramme as part of its comprehensive plan to \r\nenhance the environment and fight climate change. \r\nEritrea is confident that it will meet the Sustainable \r\nDevelopment Goals ahead of time. In its ambitious \r\ndevelopment programme, Eritrea avoids dependency \r\nand relies first and foremost on its people and on its \r\ndomestic resources. At the same time, it welcomes \r\nand encourages cooperation and partnership, with a \r\nfocus on trade and investment. Eritrea also seeks to \r\nmake a modest contribution to peace, stability and \r\ncooperation in its wider region, which includes the Nile \r\nbasin, the Horn of Africa, the Red Sea basin and the \r\nGulf. It has successfully fought and continues to fight \r\nradicalization, extremism and terrorism both on its own \r\nand in cooperation with its neighbours.\r\nEritrea extends its hands of friendship and solidarity \r\nto all peoples and nations who strive to build their \r\ncountries and contribute to a fairer, more just and more \r\nequal world. Eritrea takes the initiative to engage with \r\nall countries, including those who differ with it. Eritrea \r\nstrongly believes that its political, economic, social \r\nand diplomatic path would be smoother and easier if \r\nthe external obstacles that have been on its path were \r\nremoved. It therefore once again calls on the Security \r\nCouncil to lift the unfair and unjust sanctions imposed \r\non it for the past nine years. There is no justification \r\nfor them to continue, and they do not serve any useful \r\npurpose.\r\nAnother obstacle facing Eritrea — indeed, facing \r\nthe whole Horn of Africa region — is the 15-year-old \r\noccupation of sovereign Eritrean territory by Ethiopia. \r\nEritrea calls on the Security Council to ensure the \r\nend of that f lagrant violation of international law and \r\nseveral United Nations resolutions.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Yldiz Pollack-Beighle, Minister for Foreign Affairs \r\nof the Republic of Suriname.\r\nMs. Pollack-Beighle (Suriname): On behalf of \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Desiré Delano Bouterse, President \r\nof the Republic of Suriname, I wish to extend our \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 3/28\r\ncongratulations to Mr. Lajčák on his election to preside \r\nover the General Assembly. Suriname is grateful to the \r\nformer President, Mr. Peter Thomson, for his efforts \r\nin addressing the issues of small and vulnerable States \r\nwithin the small island developing States construct, and \r\nwe wish him success in his new role as Special Envoy \r\nof the Secretary-General on Oceans.\r\nAllow me to address critical issues related to the \r\ntheme of this year’s session that are directly related to \r\nSuriname and the region we belong to. \r\nSuriname cannot but give special attention to the \r\nextraordinary fashion in which the annual hurricane \r\nseason has presented itself in the Caribbean. Our \r\nthoughts go out to the many families, mothers and \r\nchildren, the elderly and the sick who are living the \r\nworst possible nightmare. We are convinced that those \r\naffected will be comforted by the hope that all is not \r\nlost, since the world community stands with them and \r\nprays for the betterment and speedy recovery of our \r\nregion. We also acknowledge the suffering in Mexico \r\nas a result of the recent heavy earthquakes and express \r\nour deep sympathy for its victims.\r\nThose events confront us with the relativity of \r\nhuman power and State power, whether unilateral or \r\nmultilateral. A quick review of the damage caused by \r\nthe recent natural disasters shows the destruction of \r\nthe means of production and physical infrastructure. \r\nThat has created social disruption that goes far beyond \r\nthe immediate needs of the victimized societies. We \r\nalso observe that the world at large demonstrates a \r\nstrong sense of solidarity when calamity strikes and \r\nhumanitarian assistance is urgently needed. However, \r\nto alleviate the desperate condition of the peoples, we \r\nmust, in our international efforts, address the calamities \r\nfrom a deeper and wider perspective.\r\nWe must assist the respective Governments \r\nin restructuring socioeconomic and physical \r\ninfrastructure in such a way that those States can \r\nbecome more resilient and reduce their vulnerability \r\nin future. That will require the development of \r\ninnovative concepts and intensive sharing of global \r\nexperiences. Combining forces on the global scale has \r\nbecome crucial. Furthermore, it will imply aggressive \r\nmobilization of adequate resources. \r\nSuch necessary resource mobilization will face \r\nobstacles. We will have to confront the fact that a \r\nnumber of the more aff luent nations entertain inward-\r\nlooking policies that do not augur well regarding the \r\npressing need to join hands in solving such truly global \r\nproblems. Recent weeks have made it very clear to \r\nall of us that the forces of nature do not discriminate. \r\nSuriname strongly supports the view that nations \r\nshould proportionately contribute at a global level if we \r\nwant to survive as humankind. \r\nWhen scientists indicate precise and foreseeable \r\nnatural disasters, it is obvious that we should take \r\nprecautionary measures, mitigate possible dangers \r\nand adapt existing structures to minimize the effect. \r\nBecoming more resilient remains the only way. In \r\nthat connection, it is unacceptable that Caribbean \r\ncountries, including Suriname, are being graduated to \r\nmiddle-income countries, with zero option to obtain \r\nconcessional loans.\r\nToday, I, too lament the fact that the vulnerability \r\nof those countries should be taken into account when \r\nclassifications are applied. Thus, it is ironic that \r\nSuriname is facing such threats of climate change, \r\nwhile at the same time we are making tremendous \r\ncontributions to mitigate climate change. As a high-\r\nforested, low-deforestation country with 90 per cent \r\nforest cover — the highest in the world — Suriname \r\nprovides regulation services to the global climate, \r\nincluding as a carbon sink.\r\nIn addition to providing livelihoods to indigenous \r\nand tribal communities, our forests are biodiversity \r\nhotspots with an impressive number of endemic and \r\ninternationally significant species. Our forests also \r\nsupport freshwater regulation as part of the unique \r\nAmazon ecosystem and provide employment and \r\nincome generation through an active forest industry. \r\nAbove all, we have set aside for conservation purposes \r\n1.6 million hectares of pristine rainforest, referred to \r\nas the Central Suriname Nature Reserve, as a gift to \r\nhumankind.\r\nWhile Suriname’s greenhouse-gas emissions have \r\nhistorically been negative, it is a challenge to enhance \r\nthe country’s economic development while maintaining \r\nthat unique position in the world. To achieve that goal, \r\nSuriname is ready to partner with Governments, the \r\nglobal community and other stakeholders to transform \r\nour economy into one in which environmental \r\nprotection — including through the REDD+ \r\nprogramme for reducing emissions from deforestation \r\nand degradation in developing countries — social \r\nadvancement and economic prosperity take central \r\nstage. Our multi-annual development plan, recently \r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n4/28 17-29813\r\nadopted by Parliament, is testimony to that vision for \r\nour nation’s sustainable development.\r\nOn the issues of non-interference and \r\nnon-intervention, I draw the Assembly‘s attention \r\nto the following. The natural disasters I just referred \r\nto coincide with growing political conflicts, and that \r\nmay well lead to a serious loss of human lives and the \r\ndestruction of human achievements. A number of those \r\nconflicts are related to a stark disrespect for the basic \r\nprinciples that have been enshrined in the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations since 1945.\r\nNon-interference in the affairs of sovereign States \r\nand non-intervention are not empty principles. They are \r\nbased on a firm belief that all peoples are equal and that \r\nthe prevailing structures of government and democracy \r\ncannot be prescribed externally. Recent interventions \r\nin the Middle East have not created better societies. \r\nOn the contrary, we have witnessed divided, warring \r\nfactions that can hardly be qualified as an improvement \r\nto the Governments that were ousted.\r\nSuriname also has experienced the ill effects of \r\ninterference in internal affairs. The destruction of \r\ninfrastructure and means of production amounted to \r\napproximately $300 million, and much worse than that \r\nis the fact that hundreds of children were deprived of \r\naccess to education and proper health care. Today as a \r\nnation we are still suffering from the results of the so-\r\ncalled foreign-supported internal strife that disrupted \r\nsocieties in the interior that were characterized by a \r\nsocioeconomic order that had lasted for more than 300 \r\nyears.\r\nSuriname knows what interference means, and the \r\nonly way we have dealt with it is by insisting on dialogue, \r\nwhich resulted in the signing of the peace treaty in May \r\n1992. So when we tell the world that non-interference \r\nand non-intervention are principles to adhere to at all \r\ncosts, we are speaking from our own experience. For \r\nalmost three decades, Suriname’s commitment to peace \r\nand development through the promotion of dialogue and \r\nthe implementation of broad-based social programmes \r\nremained in full accordance with the principles and \r\nguidelines of the United Nations. Dialogue in the spirit \r\nof mutual respect has led to peace and prosperity.\r\nIn that same vein, in 2012 the legislature passed \r\nan amendment to the amnesty law of 1992 that applied \r\namnesty for the full period of political violence \r\nin Suriname, from 1980 to 1992. In doing so, the \r\nlegislature complied with article 8 of the Constitution, \r\nwhich bans discrimination and guarantees equal rights \r\nto all citizens. That amendment further provided for \r\nthe truth and reconciliation commission, allowing for a \r\nclear distinction between politically motivated violence \r\nand criminal acts.\r\nAllow me to inform this gathering that Suriname’s \r\npath to peace and sustainable development enjoyed full \r\nacceptance in 2015, when a greater majority elected the \r\nincumbent Government. Moreover, civil society has \r\ntaken up the responsibility to advance the peace process \r\nthrough the implementation of initiatives that contribute \r\nto the cause of truth-finding and reconciliation. \r\nAgainst the backdrop of those developments, \r\nSuriname took note with concern of the unverified \r\nand biased comments published by the United Nations \r\nSpecial Rapporteur on the independence of judges and \r\nlawyers. Therefore, Suriname categorically rejects the \r\nassertions of that special procedures mandate-holder, \r\nwho did not provide the Government an opportunity to \r\nrespond in a timely manner.\r\nThe seventy-first session of the General Assembly \r\nmarked a milestone in the way the world views the \r\nfive-decades-old unilateral economic, commercial \r\nand financial boycott against Cuba. Last year, not one \r\nState voted against resolution 71/5, on definitively \r\nending that unilateral decision, which has proved to \r\nbe unproductive from all angles. However, the current \r\nreality obliges us to continue expressing our deepest \r\nconcern, since we learned about the continuation of that \r\ndetrimental and unilateral policy. Suriname therefore, \r\nwith absolute respect for the sovereignty of each nation \r\nto determine its own policies, urges that constructive \r\ndialogue and cooperation must prevail and that bridges \r\nmust be built on the basis of equality and respect for \r\nindependence and sovereignty.\r\nSuriname rejects any measure that might \r\nstrengthen the blockade, which is in violation of \r\ninternational law, the sovereignty of States, the \r\nprinciples of non-intervention in internal affairs and \r\nself-determination. My Government reiterates the \r\ncritical importance of those principles and underscores \r\nthe relevance of the processes of dialogue, diplomacy, \r\npeaceful resolution of conflicts, and political and \r\neconomic cooperation as building blocks for stability, \r\npeace and democracy in the Americas.\r\nIn that line of thought, we encourage the Member \r\nStates in general, and especially the South American \r\nand Caribbean States, to deal in a constructive manner \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 5/28\r\nwith the problems of our sister nation, the Bolivarian \r\nRepublic of Venezuela. Let us continue to stress the \r\nneed for dialogue between all parties. History proves \r\nthat interference and intervention are never successful.\r\nSuriname is deeply concerned about the current \r\ndevelopments on the Korean peninsula. In whatever \r\nconfiguration for a sustainable solution, we believe \r\nthat the interests of the Korean people must remain \r\nparamount. First and foremost, the Korean people must \r\nbe given guarantees that violence, whether it originates \r\nin North Korea or elsewhere, can never be a solution to \r\nthe problem. Dialogue and negotiations will be the only \r\nremaining road to a sustainable solution for the dignity \r\nand well-being of the Korean people in their struggle for \r\npeace and development. The example of South America \r\nand the Caribbean in remaining a nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone could well serve as a model to be followed. The \r\nabsence of nuclear weapons creates an environment \r\nconducive to dialogue and meaningful negotiations. \r\nThe global village is becoming ever more \r\ninterdependent. Different cultures and ethnic \r\norientations are rapidly becoming the basis for racial \r\nand global conflicts. Therefore, we have to find new \r\nparadigms to effectively limit dogmatic adherence to \r\nreligious and social concepts. Tolerance and mutual \r\nrespect have become a must if we want to guarantee \r\npeace and sustainability for future generations.\r\nThe Government of Suriname is following, not only \r\nwith keen interest but also a certain degree of concern, \r\nthe recent re-emergence in many parts of the world \r\nof right-wing extremism framed as populism. That \r\ndevelopment has the potential to put severe pressure on \r\nsocial cohesion within countries and bilateral relations \r\nbetween nations, thereby affecting opportunities and \r\nthe potential for cooperation.\r\nSuriname has worked tirelessly to achieve national \r\nunity, which has resulted in a very diverse and well-\r\nintegrated society where tolerance forms one of the basic \r\nprinciples that underpins its very existence. Thanks to \r\nthe type of nation we have built, very disturbing and \r\ndestabilizing factors such as right-wing extremism \r\nand ethnic and religious intolerance can neither have \r\nnor find a place in our nation, nor will they ever be \r\nable to take root and grow. Today, Suriname enjoys an \r\nexceptional era of tolerance and mutual respect, with \r\nChristians, Hindus, Jews, Muslims and other religious \r\ndenominations living in an atmosphere of peace and \r\nmutual respect. With roots from all continents of the \r\nworld and through intensive dialogue and mutual \r\nrespect, Suriname has become a shining example of the \r\nimportance of not entertaining supremacist concepts.\r\nTherefore, the Government of Suriname is \r\nconsidered best positioned to understand and analyse \r\nthe current global trend, which needs to be reversed with \r\nimmediate effect. Suriname stands ready to share its \r\nexperience and best practices with other sister nations \r\non the issue of nation-building based on diversity, \r\npluralism, integration and peace. I am convinced that \r\nothers will then be able to better understand one of the \r\nimportant mottos of Suriname — diversity is power.\r\nMy Government strongly believes that focusing on \r\npeople is the quintessence of the application of power. \r\nSuriname is an example in kind. As a nation, we have \r\nrecently faced the ill effects of a largely commodity-\r\nbased export economy. The sharp downturn in oil \r\nand gold prices in recent years, combined with \r\nthe unfortunate closure of the century-old bauxite \r\nand alumina complex, has challenged Suriname’s \r\nmacroeconomic management since mid-2015.\r\nBy any international standards, Suriname faced a \r\nsevere shock that was compounded on the balance-of-\r\npayments side by the sharp increase in imports related \r\nto two major investment projects in oil and gold \r\nmining, which together accounted for about 35 per cent \r\nof annual gross domestic product. We estimate that the \r\neconomy contracted severely, by more than 10 per cent, \r\nin 2016, requiring unprecedented fiscal and monetary \r\npolicy adjustments, and some temporary balance-of-\r\npayments support. \r\nIn order to stabilize the exchange rate, reduce \r\ndomestic demand and re-establish a viable balance of \r\npayments position, the monetary authorities sharply \r\ncurtailed credit creation in the country, with credit to \r\nthe private sector contracting in nominal terms. Since \r\nOctober 2016, the exchange rate has stabilized, monthly \r\ninflation rates have fallen to less than 1 per cent and \r\nthe country has returned to a current account surplus \r\nposition. Our macroeconomic response to the external \r\nand fiscal pressures started in earnest in August 2015 \r\nwith a massive contraction in Government expenditure \r\nand increases in taxation. \r\nThe Government acknowledges that the extractive \r\nsector producing gold, fossil fuels and other marketable \r\nminerals will remain critical for our economic \r\ndevelopment in the foreseeable future. We accept that \r\nreality, being fully aware that the wealth created must \r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n6/28 17-29813\r\nbe deployed in financing a well-planned initiative to \r\nexpand our economy in a sustainable manner. With \r\nthat objective in mind, the Government has recently \r\nadopted very important legislative measures. One \r\ndeals with the establishment of a sovereign wealth \r\nand stabilization fund, and the other introduces the \r\ninstitutional framework which will facilitate foreign \r\ndirect investments. As outlined in our multi-annual \r\ndevelopment plan, Suriname intends to strike a balance \r\nbetween the export of commodities and the export of \r\nfinal products in sync with the services industry.\r\nSuriname acknowledges its citizens as the most \r\nimportant resource for its development. In spite of the \r\nchallenging budgetary constraints, the socioeconomic \r\npolicies of the Government remained people-oriented. \r\nThe continued application of the basic health-care law \r\nprovides for proper health care for our entire population. \r\nIn addition, as announced by President Bouterse and as \r\npart of the social contract, adequate housing, access to \r\neducation, youth participation, engagement and sports \r\ndevelopment, job creation and care for persons with \r\ndisabilities and the elderly have remained priorities for \r\nsustainable development and growth.\r\nThe message delivered by Secretary-General \r\nAntónio Guterres assured us all of his commitment to \r\nthe theme of the Assembly’s seventy-second session. \r\nSuriname pledges its full support and cooperation.\r\nThe implementation of the ambitious 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development, in sync with the \r\nnecessary reform of the United Nations, will carry a \r\nlot of weight. That will be a formidable challenge, and \r\ntherefore my Government believes that in addition to \r\nthe mobilization domestic resources, consideration \r\nmust be given to accessible financing, from a wide array \r\nof financial mechanisms, for development, capacity-\r\nbuilding, innovation and the transfer of technology for \r\ndeveloping countries.\r\nHaving addressed those matters of vital importance \r\nfor the survival of humankind, on the basis of the \r\nprinciples of the United Nations, we bring to mind \r\nthe Amerindian saying that we have not inherited the \r\nEarth, but that we have the Earth on loan from future \r\ngenerations. It is up to us to give that wise saying its \r\nsubstance.\r\nIn the final analysis, I wish to underscore and \r\nreiterate the utmost importance of youth involvement \r\nand participation at the highest levels. My Government \r\nhas made it a priority to create the conditions for youth \r\nto be part of decision-making processes. I refer to \r\nyoung people, among others, as innovators, members of \r\nparliament and cabinet and as chief executive officers \r\nwithin what we refer to as the youth-adult partnership. \r\nIn 2010, our Government established a special ministry \r\nresponsible for youth and sport development. It gives me \r\npleasure to announce that this year youth representatives \r\nare part of my official delegation to this seventy-second \r\nsession. Furthermore, it is through political will that \r\nmore women in our society can accede to the highest \r\nechelons of political decision-making.\r\nThe 2030 Agenda envisages a world that guarantees \r\nall inhabitants of our planet a climate conducive to self-\r\ndevelopment, a climate of respect for human dignity and \r\nof tolerance towards other cultures, with the ultimate \r\ngoal of giving our planet the gift of diversity based on \r\nmutual respect.\r\nIt is up to each one of us, regardless of our status \r\nin society; it is up to each nation, whether big or small; \r\nit is up to this multilateral Organization to focus on \r\npeople and strive for peace and a decent live for all on a \r\nsustainable planet. We owe it to ourselves; yes, we owe \r\nit to this and coming generations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Ibrahim Ahmed Abd al-Aziz Ghandour, Minister \r\nfor Foreign Affairs of the the Republic of the Sudan.\r\nMr. Ghandour (Sudan) (spoke in Arabic): It is \r\nmy pleasure to speak on behalf of the people and the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of the Sudan to wish us \r\nall success at this year’s General Assembly session. I \r\nexpress my heartfelt congratulations to the President \r\nof the General Assembly at its current session, His \r\nExcellency Miroslav Lajčák, and wish him success in \r\nhis endeavours. In addition, I would like to express \r\nmy appreciation of the wisdom and efficiency of his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, who steered the work \r\nof the seventy-first session. \r\nThe theme of the seventy-second session — “Focusing \r\non people: Striving for peace and a decent life for all \r\non a sustainable planet” — reflects the importance the \r\nUnited Nations attaches to the implementation of its \r\npillars: peace and security, sustainable development, \r\nand human rights. It also proves that the United Nations \r\nis committed to anchoring the concept of peace, \r\nprosperity and good livelihood for everyone. Those are \r\nthe hopes and ambitions that we all that seek in order \r\nto achieve sustainable development, fight poverty in all \r\nthis forms and achieve prosperity for future generations.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 7/28\r\n The Sudan looks forward to playing an effective \r\nrole in the United Nations, alognside the rest of the \r\ninternational community, in order to achieve the \r\nnecessary reform, respond to Africa’s needs regarding \r\nreform of the security Council, promote the development \r\nrole of the United Nations, implement the internationally \r\nagreed Agenda for Sustainable Development and fight \r\nagainst the politicization of justice.\r\n As part of the national dialogue initiative led by \r\nour President, Mr. Omar Hassan Al-Bashir, in 2014 a \r\nGovernment of National Unity was established with \r\nthe broad participation of various political components \r\nand previously armed groups to promote peace and \r\nsecurity in the country. The implementation of the exit \r\nstrategy for the African Union-United Nations Hybrid \r\nOperation in Darfur, pursuant to Security Council \r\nresolution 2363 (2017), proves that the Sudan has \r\nturned the page on conflict and has embarked on a new \r\nera of peace and stability. We would like to express our \r\nthanks and appreciation for the support of the United \r\nNations, the African Union, the League of Arab States, \r\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation and brotherly \r\nand friendly countries.\r\n We hope to receive the support of peace and \r\ndevelopment funds, especially the United Nations \r\nPeacebuilding Fund, as well as from the World Bank \r\nand its mechanisms, so that we can implement the \r\nGovernment’s approach, which promotes peace and \r\nimplements the outcomes of the national dialogue. \r\nThat approach will also urge the remaining armed \r\ngroups to join the quest for peace. That is why our \r\nPresident adopted resolution 479 on 1 July, expanding \r\nthe ceasefire everywhere until the end of October, \r\neven though some of those rebel groups pursue their \r\nirresponsible practices, destabilizing Darfur as they \r\ncarry out desperate military actions in May. Attempted \r\nattacks by those groups in Libya and the Republic of \r\nSouth Sudan were futile and failed. \r\nWe express our deep concern vis-à-vis the lack of \r\nstrict action by relevant United Nations entities and the \r\ninternational community against the rebel groups that \r\nhave been working as mercenaries in Libya and South \r\nSudan. That only tempts them to refuse any engagement \r\nin the peace process and comes at the time when the \r\nGovernment of the Sudan is waiting for those groups to \r\nimplement the peace road map agreement sponsored by \r\nthe African Union and supported by the international \r\ncommunity.\r\n With regard to the cooperation of the Government \r\nof the Sudan with the United Nations and the Security \r\nCouncil, we have welcomed the Panel of Experts of the \r\nSecurity Council Committee established pursuant to \r\nresolution 1591 (2005) three times in the past. The Panel \r\nvisited all states of Darfur, and its reports commended \r\nthe cooperation of my Government and emphasized \r\nthat Darfur has recovered stability and security. \r\nThat is why we stress the importance of adopting the \r\nrecommendation of the Committee Chair to review the \r\nsanctions of resolution 1591 (2005), so as to support \r\npeace in Darfur and the region.\r\n The Sudan has always defended the principles of \r\njustice and international cooperation. We have sought \r\nto implement them, especially the principle of fighting \r\nimpunity. However, the politicization of international \r\njustice, as is the case with the International Criminal \r\nCourt, has jeopardized its political weight. It has \r\ndisappointed the international community, especially \r\nthe African community, which had great hopes that \r\nthat Criminal Court would anchor the principles of \r\ninternational criminal justice. \r\nSudan’s position vis-à-vis the Court, which is \r\nexpressed in the position of the African Union in \r\nits summit decisions, stresses that the International \r\nCriminal Court is an organ that manipulates the law \r\nfor political objectives to be imposed against the will of \r\npeople, especially African people. The Court, therefore, \r\ncannot serve the purpose of justice. For that reason \r\nthe Sudan calls for heeding the African voice. We call \r\nupon the States of the world to anchor the principles of \r\njustice without allowing international justice to become \r\na political tool used by some. We also warn against the \r\nuse of the United Nations in the name of international \r\njustice, on the basis of the cooperation agreement \r\nbetween the United Nations and the International \r\nCriminal Court, in a way that tarnishes the reputation \r\nof the United Nations and involves it in international \r\npolitical conflicts. We will continue to fight any attempt \r\nto involve the Court in the United Nations system, and \r\nwe call upon all lovers of justice in the world to follow \r\nsuit.\r\nMy Government has spared no effort to fight human \r\ntrafficking, illicit migration, electronic crime and drug \r\ntrafficking to ensure sustainable comfort and stability \r\nat the international, regional and national levels. That \r\ncomes from the fact that the Sudan enjoys a geographic \r\nposition in the middle of the African continent, linking \r\nit to the rest of the continent and to the Middle East. \r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n8/28 17-29813\r\nThose efforts include effective and active involvement \r\nin the European Union-Horn of Africa Migration Route \r\nInitiative — the Khartoum Process — to address the \r\ncauses and repercussions of illicit migration in the Horn \r\nof Africa, in addition to other cooperation frameworks.\r\nAs for refugees, the Sudan hosts some 3 million \r\nfrom neighbouring countries, and other countries \r\nas well. We have provided great assistance to those \r\nrefugees, meeting more than 80 per cent of their needs \r\nat a time when the international community meets only \r\n20 per cent of that need. We do that even though half \r\nof the refugees live outside of camps, which places \r\npressure on the services we provide to our citizens \r\nbecause of difficult economic circumstances. \r\nI would like to note the recent visit of Mr. Filippo \r\nGrandi, United Nations High Commissioner for \r\nRefugees, to the Sudan in mid-August, where he met \r\nthe President of the Republic and many other officials, \r\nincluding myself. He addressed the situation of the \r\nrefugees in the Sudan and expressed great appreciation \r\nfor the role the Sudan has been playing on behalf of \r\nthe international community in providing care for the \r\nrefugees. He also commended the Sudan for opening \r\nits borders at a time when other countries are closing \r\ntheirs. He called upon the international community to \r\nprovide further support to the Sudan as it shoulders \r\nits responsibility vis-à-vis refugees, and he called for \r\nsupporting host countries and State institutions caring \r\nfor the refugees. That is something the Sudan values, \r\nand we look forward to hearing the deliberations in the \r\nGeneral Assembly around that issue. \r\nThe Sudan has received a daily influx of refugees, \r\nespecially from South Sudan, almost 2,000 persons a \r\nday at some checkpoints. In connection with the special \r\nrelations between the Sudan and South Sudan and \r\nthe shared connections between the two peoples and \r\ncountries, my delegation stresses its full commitment \r\nto efforts with international and regional partners, \r\nespecially the Intergovernmental Authority on \r\nDevelopment and the African Union, to achieve peace \r\nand stability in South Sudan. We will also continue our \r\ngreat efforts to address the humanitarian crisis caused \r\nby the conflict in South Sudan. My delegation renews \r\nits commitment to the full implementation of the \r\nagreements signed with South Sudan on 27 September \r\n2012 and all agreements signed between the two \r\ncountries to build a bright future for the two brotherly \r\npeoples. \r\nThe Sudan stresses our principled position to fight \r\nthe use of terrorism in all its forms, including violent \r\nextremism, as a means to achieve political objectives. \r\nWe are committed to all international and regional \r\nagreements and conventions that we have ratified, and \r\nwe have always been an active party at the international, \r\nregional and bilateral levels. The contributions of the \r\nSudan have had a great positive impact in fighting that \r\nphenomenon and preventing further terrorist attacks \r\nthrough information-sharing and the good relations our \r\ninstitutions have with our international and regional \r\ncounterparts. \r\nAt the national level, in March 2016 we announced \r\nour first special field study on the causes of terrorism \r\nand the means of fighting it in the Sudan, in cooperation \r\nwith the United Nations. The study was commended by \r\nthe many countries that attended and took part in the \r\nannouncement of the study. We continue our efforts in \r\ncooperation with the relevant United Nations organs to \r\nensure that the Sudanese strategy is coherent with the \r\nUnited Nations Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy.\r\n The Sudan was able to fulfil all of its technical \r\ncommitments in order to obtain foreign debt forgiveness \r\nafter the separation of South Sudan, through the work \r\nof the Tripartite Committee for the Joint Approach \r\nto the International Community on Economic Relief, \r\ncomposed of the Sudan, South Sudan and the high-\r\nlevel African mechanism, on the basis of the zero \r\noption on apportionment debt, which was extended \r\nrecently until October 2018. We have also adopted a \r\nroad map to engage with debtors and the international \r\ncommunity after fulfilling all technical conditions to \r\nobtain forgiveness in line with the Heavily Indebted \r\nPoor Countries Initiative. However, that has yet to be \r\nachieved. \r\nForeign debt is a great hurdle and a genuine \r\nburden for heavily indebted poor countries, thwarting \r\ntheir stability and sustainable development. Debt \r\naffects and negatively impacts their relations with the \r\ninternational and regional financing institutions and \r\nforeign investments. Therefore we stress the need for \r\nforgiveness in line with the Initiative. \r\nThe Sudan has been making great efforts to \r\nprovide fresh drinking water through the President’s \r\nZero Thirst programme. We believe in the importance \r\nof water. Therefore, we have made great efforts and \r\ntaken many initiatives to promote cooperation among \r\nthe Nile basin countries. We hope that those efforts \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 9/28\r\nsucceed in achieving sustainable development. To \r\nstress the pioneering role of the Sudan in addressing \r\nissues of regional development and the environment, in \r\nthe upcoming months we will host the African Great \r\nGreen Wall Summit. The Great Green Wall is one of the \r\ngreatest regional environmental cooperation projects. It \r\nstretches from Dakar in the west to Djibouti in the east, \r\nto achieve environmental balance in the African desert \r\nand to reduce the impact of climate change. Africa \r\nwill be the main victim of climate change if this is not \r\naverted. \r\nThe Sudan stresses its firm position with regard \r\nto preserving the nuclear non-proliferation regime and \r\ndestroying all weapons of mass destruction. That is the \r\nonly guarantee to prevent the use of those weapons and \r\nthe only way to anchor peace, stability and security \r\nin the world. In that connection, we renew our full \r\ncommitment to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons. We call upon all countries that have \r\nnot yet signed the Treaty to do so without any delay.\r\nWe renew our firm position with respect to \r\nthe Palestinian question. We condemn all forms of \r\naggression against religious shrines in Palestine, \r\nespecially against the holy Al-Haram Al-Sharif. \r\nThe only way forward towards peace in the Middle \r\nEast is through the implementation of resolutions of \r\ninternational legitimacy and the two-State solution, \r\nreturning to the borders of 4 June 1967, in line with the \r\nArab Peace Initiative.\r\nWe renew our firm position in support of \r\nconstitutional legitimacy in Yemen. We call upon all \r\npolitical stakeholders to engage in the political process, \r\nreject fighting and violence and return to legitimacy.\r\nMy delegation stresses the need to preserve \r\nterritorial integrity in Syria. We support all efforts \r\nto overcome the crisis in that country and highlight \r\nthe importance of a political solution and the need to \r\nrespect the will of this great people. \r\nOnce again, we emphasize the need to ensure \r\nstability in brotherly Somalia. We call for the provision \r\nof all forms of support to the Government and the \r\npeople of that country so as to enable them to overcome \r\ntheir challenges and build legitimate institutions. \r\nWith regard to the situation in Libya, our position \r\nhas never changed. We continue to work with the \r\ninternational community to ensure the success of all \r\ninitiatives for security and stability, especially the \r\nSkhirat Agreement, which is the cornerstone of a \r\npolitical solution in brotherly Libya. We stress our full \r\nrespect for the security, freedom and integrity of Libya \r\nas well as the prosperity of its people.\r\nMy delegation stresses the importance of achieving \r\nstability and sustainable development on the African \r\ncontinent and addressing the economic and security \r\nchallenges that thwart its development, particularly the \r\nsituations in the Lake Chad Basin, the Great Lakes region \r\nand Mali. In this regard, we call upon the international \r\ncommunity to support regional initiatives to overcome \r\nthese challenges, such as the Force conjointe du G5 \r\nSahel and the Lake Chad Basin region initiatives. We \r\nalso call for the promotion of the strategic partnership \r\nbetween the United Nations and the African Union in \r\norder to achieve peace and stability and implement the \r\nSustainable Development Goals.\r\nIn conclusion, we renew our commitment to \r\nmultilateralism under the leadership of the United \r\nNations with a view to promoting the two most noble \r\nof purposes under the Charter of the United Nations: \r\nmaintaining international peace and security and \r\npromoting the prosperity of all people. We stand in full \r\nsolidarity with the Secretary-General, Mr. Guterres, \r\nand support his reform agenda.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. John M. Silk, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of the Marshall Islands.\r\nMr. Silk (Marshall Islands): On behalf of the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands, I have the honour to convey warm \r\ngreetings to the General Assembly. I congratulate \r\nHis Excellency Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his election \r\nas President of the General Assembly at its seventy-\r\nsecond session. I am proud that his predecessor from \r\nthe Pacific, His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, will \r\ncontinue his service to the United Nations as the Special \r\nEnvoy of the Secretary-General for the Ocean.\r\nI also extend the condolences of my Government \r\nfor the destruction and tragic loss resulting from the \r\nrecent disasters in Mexico, the United States, Antigua \r\nand Barbuda, Cuba, Haiti, the Bahamas, Dominica and \r\nthe territories of the United States and British Virgin \r\nIslands, Puerto Rico, St. Barthélemy, Anguilla, Turks \r\nand Caicos and other islands. \r\nThe United Nations stands strong as the only place \r\nthat all of us in the world have to confront our darkest \r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n10/28 17-29813\r\nchallenges together. Even if the present moment appears \r\nuncertain, we must all remain confident and committed \r\nto ensuring that the Organization will speak for those \r\nwho might not otherwise have their voices heard.\r\nRecent events with regard to North Korea and its \r\ngrowing nuclear threat must serve as a clear mandate \r\nfor strong, urgent global cooperation and effective \r\naction. The Marshall Islands is a small island nation \r\nin the Pacific, and we wish only peace, security and \r\nstability for the world. We cannot ignore this sudden \r\nand obvious threat to the territory of Guam, our closest \r\nneighbour, friend and home to some of our citizens. The \r\nthreat posed to Guam is a threat to the wider Pacific \r\nIslands region, and we express our concern about the \r\nchallenges these actions have posed to peace, security \r\nand cooperation across the wider Pacific Rim.\r\nThe highest levels of the Government of the \r\nMarshall Islands vociferously condemn the nuclear \r\ntest of 3 September and related actions. There is no \r\nneed for debate: these actions are clear violations of \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and seriously challenge \r\nthe international disarmament and non-proliferation \r\nregime based on the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation \r\nof Nuclear Weapons. I am appalled that the Marshall \r\nIslands, of all countries, is again facing the very real \r\nthreat of an atmospheric nuclear test over the Pacific \r\nOcean.\r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands condemns \r\nthese test efforts not just for its own security, but \r\nbecause we know the impacts first-hand. The 67 \r\nnuclear tests conducted in my country between 1946 \r\nand 1958 have produced a burdensome legacy that we \r\nhope no other nation or people will ever have to bear. \r\nThese tests were conducted when my country was \r\nunder the tutelage of the United Nations Trusteeship \r\nCouncil, which was charged with our welfare and well-\r\nbeing. When the Marshallese leaders travelled to New \r\nYork to present two petitions to urgently halt nuclear \r\ntests in 1954 and 1956, the United Nations responded \r\nwith Trusteeship Council resolutions 1082 (XIV) and \r\n1493 (XVII), which are the only times any United \r\nNations organ has ever specifically authorized nuclear \r\ntests. The consequences of this ignorance were — and \r\nare — beyond horrific.\r\nOur people and environment have suffered as no \r\nother people should. The impacts of this legacy today \r\nremain stark and present challenges, passed from one \r\ngeneration to the next: from mother to daughter, father \r\nto son. This is why, in 2012, the United Nations Special \r\nRapporteur on the implications for human rights of \r\nthe environmentally sound management and disposal \r\nof hazardous substances and waste outlined the clear \r\nhuman rights implications and responsibilities which \r\nwe affirm. I thank the Secretary-General for his \r\nstatement to the Chair of the Pacific Island Forum on \r\n14 August 2016, in which he said that\r\n“finding a solution to this issue is critical for the \r\nfuture of the Republic of the Marshall Islands”, \r\nassuring us that relevant United Nations entities stand \r\nready to respond to requests for assistance.\r\nRecent events should be creating far greater \r\npolitical resolve to curb and ultimately eliminate global \r\nnuclear threats. In this regard, the Republic of the \r\nMarshall Islands supports those nations that are now \r\nable to accede to the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons in so doing, and we will continue to add our \r\nown voice in all forums, including in the Comprehensive \r\nNuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization and the Review \r\nand Extension Conferences of the Parties to the Treaty \r\non the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons. \r\nWe are committed to a closed and inclusive \r\nexamination of our own participation in the Nuclear-\r\nBan Treaty by listening closely to our stakeholders \r\nand affected citizens, taking into account any possible \r\nimplications for our common security relations. It will \r\nalways remain our fervent hope that such weapons \r\nof mass destruction shall never again be tested or \r\nunleashed upon the world and that all nuclear-armed \r\nnations will find the necessary political will to disarm.\r\nEarlier this year, my country experienced the tragic \r\nloss of our one-time Minister and climate ambassador, \r\nMr. Tony de Brum, and I wish to express my gratitude \r\nto those who have conveyed their condolences. \r\nAmbassador de Brum once said that for the Marshall \r\nIslands, \r\n“[w]e are suffering the result of climate change and \r\nof the nuclear legacy and we have had nothing to do \r\nwith either... In either case, people have to choose \r\nto end this world, this universe. You can either do \r\nit slowly with climate change, or you can press a \r\nbutton and blow it up. And neither is justified”.\r\nJust across from the United Nations, in the East \r\nRiver, there sits Belmont Island. It is a small, raggedy \r\nlittle outcrop only 1 metre tall. This island in New York \r\nmust now serve as a reminder for the world’s diplomats \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 11/28\r\nthat if they ever see it vanish beneath the rising sea, then \r\nthey must also know that they have lost the Marshall \r\nIslands in the Pacific. \r\nClimate change is real, and no credible scientist \r\ncould ever make it otherwise. But what we see with our \r\nown eyes, in our low-lying islands, reveals a real present \r\nand growing threat to our own survival and security as a \r\nnation and as a State Member of the United Nations. We \r\nwelcome the entry into force of the Paris Agreement, \r\nwhich stands as a truly robust, ambitious and long-term \r\nagreement. We must not allow our confidence in each \r\nother to be thrown off by road bumps in the short term. \r\nWe urge the ratification of and full participation \r\nin the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol, \r\nwhich is the legacy of the personal drive of the late \r\nMinister-in-Assistance to the President of the Marshall \r\nIslands, Mr. Mattlan Zackhras, who suddenly and \r\ntragically passed away last month. At the end of a long \r\nnight of negotiations last year, the late Minister said that \r\nwhen the Amendment was adopted he would be proud \r\nto call on all Marshallese children because he knew \r\nthat the Kigali Amendment could mean the difference \r\nbetween whether they would have a country — and a \r\nfuture — or not. \r\nWe strongly support the leadership of our Pacific \r\nisland neighbour, Fiji, as the incoming President of \r\nthe Conference of the Parties to the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change, and we \r\nhope that in its care and with its leadership, the parties \r\nwill adopt a strong set of rules. The Paris Agreement \r\nis only as strong as the political confidence that \r\nstands behind it. It is beyond imperative that, even \r\nin such early moments, committed nations start the \r\nchallenging task of pushing ourselves to do even more. \r\nEven with our limited resources, the Marshall Islands \r\nis committed not only to implementing the Agreement, \r\nbut also to exploring where our own action on energy \r\ncan be strengthened. We must match our own ambitions \r\nwith respect to emissions with stronger approaches and \r\ncloser bilateral work. \r\nThe Republic of the Marshall Islands strongly \r\nagrees with the widespread call from the large and \r\ngrowing chorus of our fellow Member States for a more \r\neffective and efficient United Nations. It is beyond \r\nnecessary. We support the Secretary-General taking \r\naction under his own authority to continue to initiate \r\npractical but powerful efforts to reduce duplication and \r\nimprove delivery. It is a question not only of the use \r\nof public funds, including our own, but also of all of \r\nus improving our ability to achieve our full potential \r\nand making clear progress in the attainment of the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We cannot do it \r\nalone, and we cannot do itwith an international architect \r\nthat, however good its intentions, has frequently lost the \r\nfocus needed to help us make the connections between \r\ninternational forums and our local communities.\r\nBefore we engage in an impossible fight over \r\nresources, we must first examine the use of our \r\nresources already at hand. Our small in-country \r\nteam often struggles with gaining access to seasoned \r\ninternational staff who can help us learn to navigate the \r\nsystem. The United Nations Development Programme \r\nResident Coordinator for the Marshall Islands actually \r\nresides in another nation nearly 3,000 kilometres away. \r\nOur Resident Coordinator, who is fully dedicated to \r\nher mission, is also charged with being a coordinator \r\nfor eight other remote island nations, one of which she \r\nis a resident of. We must re-examine the management \r\ndecisions that led to such an outcome. Without stronger \r\nfocus from the United Nations system, small island \r\ndeveloping States could face serious barriers to their \r\nability to implement the SDGs. \r\nThe Ocean Conference on the implementation \r\nof SDG 14, which took place last June, stands as a \r\nwatershed moment of political will. But the good \r\nwords uttered in those forums too often fall short \r\nwhen it comes to making global and regional decisions \r\non oceans and fisheries. The Pacific small island \r\ndeveloping States have sounded the alarm on the state \r\nof the world’s oceans, which everyone has heard, but \r\nperhaps the alarm is not loud enough. As parties to the \r\nnarrow agreement and beyond, we in the Pacific have \r\nthe potential to effect a profound change in the role of \r\nthe market in order to dramatically strengthen our own \r\neconomic trajectory and boost global food security \r\nalong the way. The United Nations system itself must \r\ndo far more to help us focus on these transformative \r\nopportunities. And even if some of our partners are still \r\nslow to rise with us, the marketplace is already leading \r\nthe way. \r\nWhat the Pacific region is doing for tuna by ensuring \r\nour participation while promoting sustainable practices, \r\nwe are also doing with the wider oceans. Increasingly \r\nour political partners will come to realize that our \r\npolitical support depends not just on the pressure they \r\napply, but on how willing they are to follow our lead on \r\nsustainable oceans and fisheries issues. While it may be \r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n12/28 17-29813\r\nour own Pacific economic and environmental survival \r\nat stake, it is also a great incentive for the rest of the \r\nworld to know that two thirds of our planet’s surface is \r\nno longer in peril. \r\nNo one is to be left behind when it comes to the \r\nSDGs or to complying with the Charter of the United \r\nNations. Therefore, we should consider that the \r\nexclusion of Taiwan from the United Nations and its \r\nrelated agencies has created major challenges for both \r\nthe Government and the people of Taiwan in the pursuit \r\nof their fundamental right to participate. As is the case \r\nfor my nation, Taiwan is an indispensable partner for \r\nthe international community, including for our own \r\nreceipt of humanitarian aid, medical assistance, disease \r\nprevention, environmental protection, anti-terrorism \r\nand transnational-crime prevention. Practical \r\napproaches could allow us to work through existing \r\ncontroversies in order to achieve the global benefits of \r\nuniversal participation, including in the International \r\nCivil Aviation Organization, the United Nations \r\nFramework Convention on Climate Change and the \r\nWorld Health Organization.\r\nSecurity Council resolution 2758 (1971) has been \r\nmisused to justify the people of Taiwan’s exclusion \r\nfrom the United Nations. As a result, we are missing \r\nan important opportunity to cooperate with a proactive \r\ncontributor to peace and the common global good. The \r\nUnited Nations, I believe, can and must do better.\r\nIn conclusion, these may be trying times, and the \r\nchallenges of the world are severe, but it is in such \r\nadversity that true character is defined. And if an \r\neffective United Nations was ever truly needed, it is now. \r\nWe must look outward to embrace the community of \r\nnations rather than look inward at our own self-interest \r\nto the detriment of others. Multilateral engagement \r\nmust be our guiding light as we move towards a more \r\neffective and efficient United Nations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Yousuf bin Alawi bin Abdallah, Minister \r\nResponsible for Foreign Affairs of the Sultanate of \r\nOman.\r\nMr. Abdallah (Oman) (spoke in Arabic): At the \r\noutset, I would like to congratulate His Excellency \r\nMr. Lajčák and his friendly country, the Slovak \r\nRepublic, on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session. We are \r\nconfident that his vast experience and competence in \r\nthe political realm will enable him to steer the work \r\nof this session to a successful conclusion. We are also \r\npleased to express our appreciation for his predecessor, \r\nMr. Peter Thomson of the Republic of Fiji, whose \r\nefforts during his presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat its seventy-first session were commendable.\r\nIt is an equal pleasure to congratulate Mr. António \r\nGuterres on his appointment as Secretary-General, and \r\nwe wish him every success in his noble tasks. We assure \r\nhim of the Sultanate of Oman’s readiness to cooperate \r\nwith him and all the States Members of the United \r\nNations to achieve the Organization’s lofty goals and \r\nobjectives, above all the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security.\r\nEarlier civilizations f lourished in parallel with \r\nhumankind’s belief in divine books, which created a set \r\nof values and principles for cooperation, coexistence, \r\nknowledge and scientific exchange, inter alia. We \r\nbelieve that religious and cultural heritage, along \r\nwith the values of civilizations, enrich and enhance \r\nour understanding of peace. We should therefore not \r\noverlook such a heritage since it is an important means \r\nfor disseminating the culture of peace and coexistence \r\nthroughout the world.\r\nIn our foreign policy and international relations, \r\nwe have adopted an approach that supports peace, \r\ncoexistence, tolerance, dialogue and close cooperation \r\namong all nations and peoples. The Sultanate of Oman \r\nis also committed to the principles of righteousness, \r\njustice, equality, non-interference in the internal \r\naffairs of other countries, and the peaceful settlement \r\nof disputes, based on the principles of the Charter of \r\nthe United Nations and the rules of international law. \r\nThis perspective boosts confidence, enhances mutual \r\nrespect for the sovereignty of States and promotes good-\r\nneighbourliness in a way that enables States to maintain \r\nsecurity, stability and prosperity. Accordingly, we call \r\nupon all States to support peace efforts and to join \r\nhands to spread peace as a global culture at all levels.\r\nPeace and dialogue are of vital importance for \r\nhumankind. They are a collective responsibility. The \r\nUnited Nations is vested with the responsibility to \r\nlead the effort to foster them. However, the support of \r\nthe international community is also needed to pursue \r\nnational and international interests, but this cannot be \r\nachieved without giving the United Nations a strong \r\nrole in protecting the world from conflicts and war.\r\nPolitical and economic conflicts represent a failure \r\nof the international community to lend support for the \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 13/28\r\nleast developed countries, leading to many conflicts and \r\nproblems, including transcontinental global migration, \r\nthe spread of chaos, upheavals, troubles and instability \r\nin many parts of the world. The economic slowdown \r\nand the decrease in global trade have exacerbated \r\nthese problems, especially in the developing countries, \r\nwhich have been negatively affected by World Trade \r\nOrganization (WTO) agreements. The WTO has had \r\nlimited ability in achieving its primary goal of building \r\ndeveloping States’ international trade capacities. We \r\nbelieve that the drive of some parties to gain a larger \r\nshare of global markets or to implement isolationist and \r\nprotectionist policies aggravates problems and increase \r\ntensions throughout the world. \r\nAccordingly, we deem it highly important that the \r\ninternational community adopt a new vision that would \r\nlead to greater justice and expand common interests, \r\nwhile helping developing nations attain higher levels \r\nof sustainable development. This could be achieved if \r\nMember States adhered to the principles of the Charter \r\nof the United Nations and avoided unilateral decisions \r\nor policies. The United Nations must once again take \r\nthe lead in the path towards peace. Its agencies should \r\nplay a more active role in the development process in \r\norder to achieve sustainable development.\r\nFrom this rostrum, we call on all States to exert \r\ngreater efforts and cooperate to help the United Nations \r\nrestore its pivotal role in international relations. We \r\nalso look towards a more vital role for the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in the fulfilment of the purposes and principles \r\nof the United Nations. We support the Secretary-\r\nGeneral in his efforts to strengthen and reactivate the \r\nrole of the Organization in bringing international peace \r\nand security to the world.\r\nWe also call upon the international community \r\nto, in a spirit of responsibility and credibility, spread \r\nthe culture of dialogue and understanding in order \r\nto peacefully settle disputes and end tensions in the \r\nworld. We consider it essential to discover the causes \r\nof weakness in international policies and adopt a more \r\neffective approach to settling regional and international \r\nproblems, including climate change and other issues \r\nthat affect the security and stability in the world. On this \r\nbasis, we invite the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity to shoulder their responsibilities and strive \r\nto achieve peace, prevent conflicts and wars, and settle \r\ndifferences through dialogue and other peaceful means. \r\nAccordingly, my country renews its readiness to work \r\nwith the United Nations to build a new world that is \r\nsecure and stable.\r\nThe world is witnessing new transformations \r\nin the scientific and technological realms that are \r\naffecting people’s lives. There is also a steady growth \r\nin population. Therefore, we stress the need to adopt \r\na new perspective to establish a global partnership \r\nthat would benefit from such advanced technologies \r\nand scientific progress. The global breakthrough in \r\ntechnology achieved through the signing of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change is an important gain \r\nfor humankind. Several natural disasters recently have \r\nstruck the world, which should convince all States that \r\nit is in their interest to adhere to the Paris Agreement.\r\nThe Final Document of the 2010 Review Conference \r\nof the Parties to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of \r\nNuclear Weapons indicated that the resolution adopted \r\nat the 1995 Review and Extension Conference on a \r\nthe establishment of a zone in the Middle East free \r\nof nuclear and all other weapons of mass destruction \r\nremains in force until it achieves all its objectives. \r\nIn that regard, my country supports all international \r\nefforts to draft a binding instrument that would cover \r\nthe loopholes emerging from the Non-Proliferation \r\nTreaty. This highly important document would help the \r\ninternational community to eliminate weapons of mass \r\ndestruction. \r\nMy country denounces terrorism in all its forms and \r\nmanifestations, regardless of its justifications. Based \r\non our adherence to the Charter of the United Nations, \r\nwhich calls for the maintenance of international peace \r\nand security, we support all efforts aimed at confronting \r\nthat scourge by taking the appropriate measures \r\nbased on the relevant Arab, Islamic and international \r\nresolutions, treaties and agreements.\r\nThe world is facing real challenges that must be \r\ncountered through a unified stance so as to respond \r\nto the aspirations of humankind. We therefore believe \r\nthat working on the basis of the true meaning of \r\npartnership and common destiny among members of \r\nthe international community is the most appropriate \r\nmeans to achieve such a goal. We wish the General \r\nAssembly every success at this session.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Denis Moses, Minister for Foreign and CARICOM \r\nAffairs of the Republic of Trinidad and Tobago.\r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n14/28 17-29813\r\nMr. Moses (Trinidad and Tobago): Each year, as a \r\ncommunity of nations, we gather together to reaffirm \r\nthe possibilities and potential arising from our resolve \r\nthat finding solutions to the many challenges facing \r\nour planet can best be achieved through our collective \r\naction and shared dialogue and by striving for peace \r\nand a decent life for all peoples.\r\nOn behalf of the Government and the people of \r\nthe Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, I am honoured \r\nand delighted to address the Assembly today. I extend \r\nheartfelt congratulations to Mr. Miroslav Lajčák on his \r\nelection as President of the General Assembly at its \r\nseventy-second session. We are confident that he will \r\ndischarge his mandate with efficiency and impartiality \r\nfor the benefit of all nations. He has the support of our \r\ndelegation.\r\nI also seize this opportunity to convey thanks and \r\nbest wishes to His Excellency Mr. Peter Thomson, \r\nformer President of the General Assembly, for his hard \r\nwork, commitment and leadership during the seventy-\r\nfirst session. \r\nOnce again, I extend congratulations to His \r\nExcellency Mr. António Guterres on his assumption \r\nof the position of Secretary-General. We wish to \r\nencourage and commend his direction and guidance in \r\nsteering us forward.\r\nFrom shifting weather patterns to global warming to \r\nsea-level rise, the impacts of climate change are global \r\nin scope and unprecedented in scale. In our region, we \r\nhave witnessed the catastrophic effects of Hurricanes \r\nIrma, Jose and Maria, which have undoubtedly changed \r\nforever lives in several of our Caribbean countries, \r\nleaving some islands almost uninhabitable and resulting \r\nin many untimely deaths. The recent earthquake in \r\nMexico and hurricanes in the United States ought to be \r\ncounted within the realm of the recent global disasters.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, which is in the southernmost \r\npart of the Caribbean, was spared from the ravages of \r\nthese hurricanes. It is with empathy that I extend, on \r\nbehalf of the Government and the people of Trinidad \r\nand Tobago, heartfelt condolences to our Caribbean \r\nfamily. We are forever mindful that, given our spirit of \r\nresilience, we will rebuild that which was lost. Trinidad \r\nand Tobago stands in solidarity with the affected \r\ncountries and will continue to assist with relief efforts. \r\nHowever, rebuilding will require resources, as well as \r\nthe cooperation and collaboration of the international \r\ncommunity, because we simply cannot do it alone.\r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago joins \r\nwith other Caribbean Community Governments in \r\nexpressing our gratitude for the tremendous generosity \r\nand support provided in face of the region’s most urgent \r\nneed. Our thanks and appreciation also go out to the \r\nCaribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency \r\n(CDEMA), the region’s first responder. However, \r\nCDEMA will need additional resources and funding \r\nto enable it to do even more to facilitate its immediate \r\nresponses to natural disaster.\r\nIn the face of the recent natural catastrophes, how \r\ncan one deny the scientific findings that climate change \r\nis real and that it is here and indeed upon us? The events \r\nof the past months in the Caribbean remind us all once \r\nmore that small island developing States (SIDS) remain \r\nat the forefront of the impact of climate change. We \r\ncannot by any means continue with the same approach, \r\nas nature’s fury holds no prejudice. Yet, in the light of \r\ntheir categorization as high-income countries under \r\nthe outdated formula of gross domestic product per \r\ncapita, Caribbean countries will not qualify for aid and \r\ndevelopment assistance in their time of need.\r\nI join my Caribbean colleagues in calling for a \r\nmultidimensional approach that takes into consideration \r\nreal national needs and priorities and takes these \r\nextraordinary circumstances into account in order to \r\nprovide access to development assistance, aid and debt \r\nrelief as the Caribbean region collectively embarks \r\ntogether on the arduous task of recovery, rehabilitation \r\nand reconstruction.\r\nIn order to achieve human and global sustainable \r\ndevelopment, we must treat unmitigated climate change \r\nand global temperature rise as a priority issue. Trinidad \r\nand Tobago is doing its part and remains committed \r\nto achieving the overarching objectives of the United \r\nNations Framework Convention on Climate Change \r\nand the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Through \r\nour nationally determined contribution, Trinidad \r\nand Tobago has indicated its intention to reduce by \r\nDecember 2030 greenhouse-gas emissions in its public-\r\ntransportation sector by 30 per cent, in comparison \r\nwith 2013 levels.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago has therefore framed its \r\nnational development plan for the period 2016-2030, \r\nentitled Vision 2030, with a thematic focus of “Many \r\nhearts, many voices, one vision”, in keeping with the \r\n2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. In this \r\ncontext, we have mapped our national development \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 15/28\r\ngoals in accordance with global priorities and the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Trinidad \r\nand Tobago and the United Nations signed the \r\nMulti-country Sustainable Development Framework in \r\nApril. We acknowledge and thank the United Nations \r\nDevelopment Programme for its assistance with these \r\nactivities.\r\nWe are also pleased that the recently completed \r\nquadrennial comprehensive policy review has initiated \r\na recalibration of the United Nations development \r\nsystem. This would better support developing \r\ncountries, including SIDS, in the implementation of the \r\nprogrammes of action, including the SIDS Accelerated \r\nModalities of Action (SAMOA) Pathway and the \r\n2030 Agenda. In alignment with the quadrennial \r\ncomprehensive policy review and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral’s reform proposals, Trinidad and Tobago \r\nremains committed to ensuring that the United Nations \r\ndevelopment system adopts a more f lexible and tailored \r\napproach to sustainable development assistance to \r\nassist countries in implementing the SDGs in a focused, \r\ncoordinated, coherent and cost-effective manner.\r\nOceans cover three quarters of the Earth’s surface \r\nand contain more than 95 per cent of the Earth’s \r\nwater. It is therefore indisputable that promoting the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of oceans, seas and \r\nmarine resources is of critical importance to sustainable \r\ndevelopment and the survival of all humankind. \r\nTrinidad and Tobago welcomes the progress achieved \r\nat the recently concluded Oceans Conference in June \r\nand the adoption of the historic call for action, as well \r\nas the commitments and actions to be taken by Member \r\nStates to safeguard the health of the oceans through the \r\nimplementation of SDG 14.\r\nAs a small island developing State, Trinidad and \r\nTobago is highly vulnerable to the unprecedented \r\nrate of loss of marine biodiversity and the impacts of \r\nunsustainable practices on the marine environment. \r\nConsequently, we welcome the adoption of the \r\nrecommendations of the Preparatory Committee \r\nestablished pursuant to resolution 69/292, on the \r\ndevelopment of a legally binding instrument under the \r\nUnited Nations Convention on the Law of the sea on the \r\nconservation and sustainable use of marine biological \r\ndiversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction. Notably, \r\nthis agreement will seek to address existing regulatory \r\nand legal gaps and ensure that the resources of our \r\noceans are properly conserved and managed for the \r\nbenefit of present and future generations\r\nAfter two years of having the Preparatory \r\nCommittee and about 10 years of negotiations, we \r\nbelieve that the time is long overdue for us to translate \r\nwords into action. Trinidad and Tobago therefore looks \r\nforward to the convening of an intergovernmental \r\nconference in 2018 to consider the recommendations \r\nof the Preparatory Committee on the elements and to \r\nelaborate the text of an international legally binding \r\ninstrument under the Convention.\r\nThe Constitution of Trinidad and Tobago protects \r\nthe human rights and fundamental freedoms of all \r\ncitizens and residents without discrimination based on \r\nrace, origin, colour, religion or sex. Our Government \r\naccords high priority to achieving gender equality and \r\nthe empowerment and advancement of women, who are \r\npivotal to the achievement of the SDGs. In the words \r\nof the Secretary-General, “Women’s rights are indeed \r\nhuman rights”. One cannot overstate the importance of \r\nprotecting the rights of women and ensuring their full \r\nparticipation on an equal basis with men.\r\nIn placing women at the forefront of our development, \r\nit should be noted that a Trinidad and Tobago national \r\nis one of two women who sit on the Commission on \r\nthe Limits of the Continental Shelf, which comprises \r\n20 members. With regard to the advancement of girls, \r\nthe Parliament of Trinidad and Tobago recently passed \r\nthe Miscellaneous Provisions (Marriage) Bill. This bill \r\nprovides for outlawing child marriage in Trinidad and \r\nTobago by raising the legal age of marriage to 18 years.\r\nWe are currently witnessing unprecedented levels \r\nof displacement in the world. According to the United \r\nNations High Commission for Refugees, approximately \r\n65.5 million people have been forced to f lee their \r\nhomes. This amounts to nearly 22.5 million refugees. \r\nThe Government of Trinidad and Tobago considers \r\nit important to develop ways to effectively manage \r\nmigration and to take the necessary steps to enable the \r\nprocess of mainstreaming migration into development \r\nplanning. We have therefore sought to make the \r\nnecessary policy changes and to participate in projects \r\nand training in order to develop the necessary tools to \r\nmainstream migration into development planning.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago was among the 122 States that \r\nvoted in favour of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, which was adopted on 7 July. The Treaty is \r\nparticularly significant as it is the first multilateral \r\nlegally binding instrument for nuclear disarmament to \r\nhave been negotiated in 20 years. We look forward to \r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n16/28 17-29813\r\nthe convening of the high-level conference on nuclear \r\ndisarmament by 2018. As a small island developing \r\nState, Trinidad and Tobago actively participated in the \r\nnegotiations to prohibit nuclear weapons, as it is acutely \r\naware of the destructive force of these weapons of mass \r\ndestruction to, inter alia, human life, the environment, \r\nfood security, infrastructure and economic growth.\r\nIn view of the continued prevalence and negative \r\neffects of illegal small arms and light weapons, \r\nincluding the issue of curbing such weapons and its \r\nammunition, Trinidad and Tobago has played leading \r\nroles in a number of United Nations initiatives, such \r\nas the Arms Trade Treaty. The proliferation of small \r\narms and light weapons has contributed significantly to \r\nviolence and instability in our region. The Arms Trade \r\nTreaty remains a key priority for Trinidad and Tobago \r\nas it seeks to regulate the illegal transfer of small arms \r\nand light weapons and ammunition.\r\nI wish to reiterate to the Assembly the Government \r\nof Trinidad and Tobago’s unequivocal commitment and \r\nunceasing call for an end to the economic, commercial \r\nand financial embargo against Cuba. We remain \r\noptimistic that there will be a diplomatic solution to \r\nfinding an end to this long-standing issue and that in \r\ngood faith the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed against Cuba, which significantly \r\nchallenges its achievement of sustainable development, \r\nwill be lifted soon.\r\nWe remain fully committed to the purposes and \r\nprinciples of the Charter of the United Nations, and in \r\nparticular to the principles of the sovereign equality of \r\nStates, non-intervention and non-interference in their \r\ninternal affairs and freedom of trade and navigation. \r\nTo this end, Trinidad and Tobago consistently supports \r\nsubregional, regional and international efforts to \r\npromote constructive dialogue to bring about the \r\ncessation, sooner rather than later, of the economic, \r\ncommercial and financial embargo against Cuba.\r\nAdherence to the rule of law is important to the \r\nachievement of Sustainable Development Goal 16, \r\nwhich seeks to promote the rule of law at the national \r\nand international levels and to ensure equal access to \r\njustice for all, as it is one of the pillars for promoting \r\nsustainable development.\r\nTrinidad and Tobago, as a democratic society, \r\nadheres to the rule of law and the protection of all human \r\nrights and fundamental freedoms. As such, we uphold \r\nthe importance of the International Criminal Court \r\n(ICC) to promoting the rule of law, encouraging respect \r\nfor human rights and achieving sustainable peace and \r\ndevelopment, in accordance with international law and \r\nthe principles of the Charter of the United Nations. \r\nAs a country which has been credited as one of the \r\nforefathers of the ICC through the pioneering work of \r\nthe late Arthur N. R. Robinson, former Prime Minister \r\nand President of Trinidad and Tobago, we remain \r\nresolute in our commitment to supporting the mandate \r\nof the ICC and its primary objective to help put an end \r\nto impunity for the perpetrators of the most serious \r\ncrimes of concern to the international community, as \r\nwell as to prevent such heinous crimes.\r\nIn conclusion, Trinidad and Tobago is particularly \r\npleased with the President’s choice of theme for the \r\nseventy-second session, “Focusing on people: Striving \r\nfor peace and a decent life for all on a sustainable \r\nplanet”. We believe that these concerns and issues \r\nare timely and necessary, especially as we are faced \r\nwith increasing humanitarian challenges, threats \r\nto international peace and security, as well as the \r\nenvironment. In harmony with the global vision for \r\nmultilateralism, we are committed to working together \r\ncollectively to find enduring and sustainable solutions to \r\nglobal disparities, poverty, rising inequality, protracted \r\nconflicts and other challenges facing the world today. \r\nWe must all do our part in this noble endeavour for the \r\ngood of humankind.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Brahim Hisseine Taha, Minister for Foreign Affairs, \r\nAfrican Integration and International Cooperation of \r\nthe Republic of Chad.\r\nMr. Mahamat (Chad) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme to extend my warm congratulations to Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on his election as President of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-second session and to assure \r\nhim of our cooperation as he carries out his important \r\nmission. I would also like to express our appreciation \r\nto Mr. Peter Thomson, who led the work of the General \r\nAssembly at its seventy-first session with talent and \r\ndiscernment.\r\nA decade ago in the Assembly, we deplored the \r\nemergence of various global crises, in particular \r\nfinancial ones and their adverse consequences on the \r\nworld economy. Even today, developing countries, \r\nincluding my own, continue to suffer the consequences \r\nof the fall in the prices of our exports. This situation \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 17/28\r\nnegatively impacts the financing of our countries’ \r\ndevelopment plans and strategies.\r\nHumankind is also called upon to address new \r\nkinds of conflicts, such as those related to the challenges \r\nof terrorism, whose growing tentacles threaten our \r\nstability and further impoverish our economies. Equally \r\nimportant are the challenges related to climatic and \r\nenvironmental hazards, whose damaging consequences \r\nhave been demonstrated in the recent landslide in \r\nSierra Leone, the onslaught of the hurricanes in the \r\nCaribbean and the United States, and the earthquake in \r\nMexico. We take the opportunity to express, from this \r\nrostrum, our solidarity with the bereaved Governments \r\nand families in the various affected countries.\r\nMoreover, the ongoing phenomena of drought and \r\ndesertification weaken our ecosystems, in particular the \r\ndrying up of Lake Chad, causing massive population \r\ndisplacements and increasing pressure on the already \r\nlimited resources of our countries. Its foreseeable \r\ndisappearance would be a disaster for the 50 million \r\nhuman beings who live off the resources that Lake \r\nChad provides. The letter and spirit of the theme of our \r\ncurrent session and the commitments contained in the \r\nParis Agreement on Climate Change should encourage \r\nthe international community to save Lake Chad.\r\nThe economic and financial crisis affecting \r\ndeveloping countries is undermining the efficient \r\nimplementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, which was tirelessly built on the \r\nachievements of the Millennium Development Goals. \r\nIts adoption in 2015 gave rise to a great deal of hope \r\nbecause it is supposed to reverse the growth of poverty \r\nand promote development. However, with the persistence \r\nof the economic crisis, recurring threats to peace and \r\nsecurity, the appearance of cyclical pandemics and \r\nthe increase in the phenomenon of migration, we fear \r\nthat these scourges will have a negative impact on the \r\nimplementation of the Agenda.\r\nIn this difficult economic context, in early \r\nSeptember in Paris Chad organized a round table to \r\nfinance its national development plan. We take this \r\nopportunity to thank all those who contributed to the \r\nsuccess of the round table. We hope that the pledges \r\nmade on that occasion will be fulfilled.\r\nAt the political level, Chad intends to consolidate \r\nits institutions and strengthen the democratic process \r\nby renewing its institutional framework. With this \r\nin mind, next October, in line with the social project \r\nof President of the Republic of Chad, His Excellency \r\nMr. Idriss Deby Itno, Chad will convene a national \r\nforum on the institutional reforms charged with \r\nadapting the administrative and political structures to \r\nthe country’s new realities.\r\nIn addition to the difficult economic context, we in \r\nthe subregion of the Sahel and the Sahara face particular \r\nsecurity and humanitarian challenges. Indeed, the \r\nsecurity situation in the countries of the Sahel and the \r\nSahara continues to deteriorate as a result of the actions \r\nof terrorists, armed groups and traffickers of all stripes \r\nthroughout the region. Recent attacks by terrorists \r\nin the capital of Burkina Faso and against the forces \r\nof the United Nations Multidimensional Integrated \r\nStabilization Mission in Mali, as well as almost daily \r\nattacks in north-eastern Nigeria and the far north of \r\nCameroon, show their determination to wage war \r\nagainst us to the end.\r\nThis resurgence of terrorist attacks challenges us \r\nand compels us to respond. This is why the countries of \r\nthe Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel), following \r\nthe example of the Multinational Joint Task Force, have \r\nestablished the G-5 Sahel Joint Force in the Lake Chad \r\nbasin to fight the Da’esh-affiliated terrorist group Boko \r\nHaram.\r\nIn Mali, as in the Lake Chad basin, my country is \r\ncommitted and has made enormous human, material and \r\nfinancial sacrifices. This commitment — undertaken by \r\nthe President of the Republic, His Excellency Mr. Idriss \r\nDeby Itno, with the support of all Chadians — will \r\nendure because the collective security of the region and \r\nbeyond is at stake. We must therefore consolidate our \r\nmeans of response if we want to counter this evil. \r\nThe multifaceted support of the international \r\ncommunity, and in particular of our Organization, is \r\nindispensable. We recognize the primary responsibility \r\nof the United Nations in the maintenance of international \r\npeace and security. Chad supports its peacekeeping \r\noperations throughout the world. Therefore, there is no \r\nquestion of our replacing the other forces engaged in \r\nMali. The G-5 Sahel Joint Force is a complementary \r\nentity whose objective is to respond appropriately to \r\nthe asymmetrical and unconventional warfare waged \r\nby terrorists and traffickers of all kinds. It is for this \r\nreason that we call upon the United Nations, and in \r\nparticular the Security Council, to grant a robust \r\nmandate to ensure that the Joint Force has sustainable \r\nresources to carry out its tasks.\r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n18/28 17-29813\r\nThe humanitarian situation is exacerbated by the \r\nparticularly difficult security situation in our subregion, \r\nwhich is reflected in large-scale humanitarian crises, the \r\nmassive displacement of people, famine, malnutrition \r\nand epidemics. For the past several decades, my \r\ncountry has welcomed more than 600,000 refugees and \r\ndisplaced persons f leeing conflicts in neighbouring \r\ncountries, as well as returnees and internally displaced \r\npersons following the conflicts in Libya and the Central \r\nAfrican Republic.\r\nThe current global situation and the persistence of \r\nhotbeds of tension in Chad are a source of serious concern \r\nfor my country. While we recognize the sustained \r\nsupport of all our partners for the humanitarian problem \r\nin Chad, we call on the international community to \r\nmake greater efforts to alleviate the suffering of the \r\nhost populations, refugees and displaced persons.\r\nOne of the consequences of economic difficulties \r\nand unrest is the massive migration of young Africans \r\nto other places, particularly Europe. That is an \r\nunbearable phenomenon, considering the conditions of \r\ntravel and residence in certain countries of transit and \r\nreception. That is why Chad, which is a transit country \r\nfor migrants, is consulting with its various partners to \r\naddress the root causes of the phenomenon and calls for \r\nmassive investment in the development programmes in \r\nthe countries of origin of migrants in order to put a stop \r\nto the loss of human resources.\r\nThe humanitarian situation can be resolved only if \r\nthe outbreaks of conflict in the neighbouring countries \r\nof Chad are resolved. That is why the Chadian \r\nGovernment is very attentive to those conflicts and will \r\ncontinue to work with the international community to \r\nput an end to them. The violence in the Central African \r\nRepublic continues. Chad welcomes the steps taken by \r\nPresident Touadera and his Government to assert the \r\npresence and authority of the State. He has urged all \r\narmed factions to commit themselves without delay \r\nto the peace process. We believe that the African \r\nInitiative for Peace and Reconciliation in the Central \r\nAfrican Republic is the opportunity that all parties to \r\nthe conflict should seize in order to restore peace and \r\nsecurity in that brotherly country. \r\nRegarding the situation in Libya, Chad gives its full \r\nsupport to the United Nations and the African Union in \r\nthe search for reconciliation among the various Libyan \r\nparties. But the solution to the crisis is in the hands \r\nof the Libyan political actors themselves, who have the \r\nhistorical responsibility to meet the expectations of \r\ntheir people. \r\nSouth Sudan is like a wound on the body of our \r\ncontinent. Here too, the protagonists have a moral \r\nobligation to put an end to the intolerable suffering \r\nof the people. The international community should \r\nsupport the revitalization of the August 2015 agreement \r\nand the national dialogue.\r\nAt the international level, Chad welcomed the \r\nresumption of diplomatic relations between the United \r\nStates and Cuba. There is no longer any obstacle to the \r\nnormalization of relations between the two countries. \r\nMy country believes, therefore, that maintaining the \r\ndecades-long embargo against Cuba is unfair and \r\ncounterproductive. \r\nThe Palestinian question remains a fundamental \r\nissue, with evident repercussions on other crises. Thus \r\na just and acceptable solution must be found, one that \r\nincludes the peaceful coexistence of the two States of \r\nIsrael and Palestine. Therefore, Chad will support all \r\nefforts aimed at the recognition of the State of Palestine \r\nin all its aspects and on the basis of the 1967 borders.\r\nThe world has been facing an unacceptable crisis \r\nin recent weeks, that of the plight of the Rohingya \r\nMuslim minority in Burma, who are suffering a \r\nveritable ethnic-religious purge. Chad believes that the \r\nwhole world must rise up in opposition and call on the \r\nBurmese Government to put an immediate end to that \r\ntragedy.\r\nThe Republic of Chad is deeply concerned about \r\nthe threats to world peace caused by the nuclear tests \r\nconducted by North Korea. The leaders of that country \r\nmust gauge the dramatic consequences that could come \r\nabout as a result of that policy and should prioritize \r\ndialogue in order to assert their rights.\r\nFinally, with regard to the proposals for United \r\nNations reform, Chad reiterates the common position \r\nof Africa as determined by the African Group in New \r\nYork, which emerged from the Ezulwini Consensus. \r\nWe believe that the best way to reform the United \r\nNations is to reform the Security Council and to grant a \r\nseat to Africa as a permanent member, thus enabling it \r\nto be involved in the decision-making process in world \r\naffairs. \r\nWhether with regard to economic, climatic or \r\nenvironmental questions or domestic or international \r\nissues, Chad has always been guided by concern to \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 19/28\r\nensure the safety and welfare that the citizens of the \r\nworld have the right to expect from their leaders. My \r\ncountry invites each of the States represented here \r\ntoday to implement the theme adopted this year by the \r\nAssembly in order to better our planet and the lives of \r\nits inhabitants.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on Her Excellency \r\nMs. Kamina Johnson Smith, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Foreign Trade of Jamaica.\r\nMs. Smith (Jamaica): I am delighted to extend \r\nthe warm congratulations of Jamaica to the President \r\nfor assuming the presidency of the General Assembly \r\nat the seventy-second session and to assure him of \r\nour support. We are particularly pleased to note his \r\nselection of a theme that underscores the fundamental \r\nimportance of the transformative 2030 Agenda \r\nSustainable Development, which is a plan for people, \r\nplanet and prosperity.\r\nI express, on behalf of the Government and people \r\nof Jamaica, our deepest sympathies and prayers for \r\nthe families and loved ones of victims of the recent \r\nhurricanes, which directly impacted our Caribbean \r\nbrothers and sisters and those in the United States, \r\nas well as the families and loved ones of victims of \r\nrecent earthquakes in Mexico, our dear friend from the \r\nregion. I am deeply moved by the fact that following \r\nthe passage of two massive hurricanes, thousands of \r\npeople across the Caribbean are now forced into a life \r\nthat is dramatically different from what it was just a \r\nfew days ago. On behalf of our Caribbean brothers and \r\nsisters directly impacted by the hurricanes, we wish to \r\nthank those countries and organizations that have given \r\nwithout being asked, and to urge those who have the \r\nmeans to support these countries and their peoples in \r\nthis time of urgent need.\r\nFor us in the Caribbean, climate change is not a \r\nphilosophical concept or an academic debate. It is \r\nan existential issue. It is our reality, and it requires \r\nurgent and effective action. We are ever mindful of \r\nour responsibility to strengthen our resilience and \r\nexpedite efforts towards adaptation and mitigation. \r\nYet our ability to do so is greatly impacted by the new \r\ncatastrophic events that cause social dislocation and \r\nsevere misalignment of our economies. The limited \r\nresources that we have are dwarfed by the huge sums \r\nrequired to meet recovery and reconstruction costs. \r\nHow do small States like ours, many already facing \r\nadverse debt dynamics, mobilize the financing required \r\nto build climate-resilient infrastructure? To do so, it \r\nis imperative that we identify both grant funds and \r\nconcessionary financing that can support investment in \r\nresilient infrastructure over the long term. If not, we \r\nwill continue to be caught in an inescapable cycle of \r\ndevastation, recovery and reconstruction, until the next \r\ndisaster strikes.\r\nWhile it is essential to attend to the immediate \r\nhumanitarian needs and reconstruction efforts, we \r\nmust also urgently address our long-term Sustainable \r\nDevelopmental Goals (SDGs). I urge that in our \r\ncollective efforts to implement the SDGs, we take \r\naccount of the tremendous challenges faced by \r\nvulnerable countries completely knocked off course by \r\nexternal shocks. In such circumstances, the review and \r\nfollow-up mechanisms associated with the time-bound \r\ncommitments of the Agenda are rendered meaningless. \r\nTherefore, we call on the United Nations system to \r\nestablish a mechanism to provide the requisite support \r\nand compensation to vulnerable countries affected by \r\nnatural disasters, where their implementation of the \r\n2030 Agenda and progress towards achieving the SDGs \r\nhave been derailed as a result of such external shocks.\r\nIn recognition of our vulnerabilities as a small \r\nisland developing State and the attendant complexities \r\nof our status as a middle-income country, Jamaica is \r\ncollaborating with Chile on a new initiative called the \r\nResilient 20. It seeks to create an alliance to promote \r\nresilience in countries prone to natural disasters, with a \r\nfocus on middle-income countries.\r\nWe also support calls for the development of \r\na climate change vulnerability index to provide a \r\nstandardized method for characterizing vulnerability \r\nto the adverse effects of climate change. That would \r\nenable international financial institutions and bilateral \r\ndonors to better channel financial and technical \r\nresources towards countries most susceptible to loss \r\nand damage from climate change.\r\nJamaica ratified the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange in April, and regards that historic Agreement \r\nas critical to efforts to arrest the impact of climate \r\nchange. Small island developing States were at the \r\nforefront of those negotiations and remain engaged \r\nin the Conference of the Parties process. It is an \r\ninescapable fact that we contribute the least to carbon \r\nemissions and yet we bear the brunt of the damage. In \r\nthat context, we implore all Member States to abide by \r\nthe commitments of the Agreement.\r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n20/28 17-29813\r\nClimate change also poses risks to tourism, which is \r\nan industry that owes its competitiveness to the pristine \r\nnature of our environment. Sustainable and inclusive \r\neconomic growth and job creation are priorities for \r\nJamaica, and tourism plays a critical role in ensuring \r\nthat they are achieved. That industry relies heavily \r\non the long-term sustainable investments made by the \r\nprivate sector, both national and international.\r\nFor this International Year of Sustainable Tourism \r\nfor Development, we have sought to increase such \r\ninvestments, create more jobs, promote culture and \r\nsupport community development, while safeguarding \r\nthe natural environment. In November, in partnership \r\nwith the World Tourism Organization (WTO) and the \r\nWorld Bank Group, Jamaica looks forward to hosting \r\nthe United Nations-WTO International Conference \r\non Partnerships for Sustainable Tourism, which will \r\nbe the first time such a conference is being held in \r\nthe Caribbean.\r\nJamaica is deeply concerned about the heightened \r\nmenace to international peace and security, arising \r\nparticularly from the threat of nuclear weapons. We have \r\na long-standing commitment to the goal of achieving \r\na nuclear-weapon-free world and are a State party to \r\nthe Treaty of Tlatelolco, which declared the Caribbean \r\nand Latin America as the first nuclear-weapon-free \r\nzone in a densely populated area. At the universal \r\nlevel, therefore, we welcome the fact that we now have \r\nthe first global Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons as a critical step towards addressing some of \r\nthose concerns. It is our hope that it will enter into force \r\nin short order and be duly observed universally.\r\nAs global citizens starkly aware of how closely \r\nour futures are intertwined, we condemn the recent \r\nnuclear and ballistic-missile tests carried out by the \r\nDemocratic People’s Republic of Korea, which pose \r\na grave threat to international peace and security. We \r\nurge North Korea to immediately and fully comply \r\nwith its international obligations under all relevant \r\nSecurity Council resolutions and to resume dialogue on \r\nthe denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.\r\nThe challenges that currently impede global peace \r\nand security require that we identify and address the \r\nroot causes of conflict. We therefore fully support the \r\nfocus placed by the Secretary-General on sustaining \r\npeace across the continuum from prevention, conflict \r\nresolution and peacekeeping to peacebuilding and long-\r\nterm development.\r\nWe in Jamaica are working to provide our citizens \r\nwith a safe and secure environment in which to live \r\nfull and productive lives. Our strategy includes placing \r\ngreater emphasis on safeguarding our porous borders, \r\nthrough which illicit firearms enter. Jamaica has \r\nbenefited from the support of our international partners, \r\nand we invite continued collaboration in curbing this \r\nillicit trade. We therefore look forward to the third \r\nReview Conference of the United Nations Programme \r\nof Action on Small Arms and Light Weapons, to be \r\nconvened in 2018. Furthermore, Jamaica will continue \r\nto play its part in supporting the universalization and \r\nimplementation of the Arms Trade Treaty.\r\nPeople and their well-being are at the heart of \r\nour commitment to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment. We remain focused on the most \r\nvulnerable of our citizens to ensure that those furthest \r\nbehind will benefit first from the implementation \r\nof the 2030 Agenda. The alignment between the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and our \r\nnational development plan, Vision 2030, creates a \r\nframework within which we can identify and achieve \r\nour priorities, not least of which is to ensure the dignity \r\nof the individual.\r\nWhat has become increasingly evident, however, is \r\nthat securing the resources for the implementation of \r\nthose development objectives remains critical at both the \r\nnational and the international levels. In recognition of \r\nthat fact, Jamaica has partnered with Canada to identify \r\nnew and innovative means of financing development. \r\nThrough the Group of Friends of SDG Financing, which \r\nour countries co-chair, we have been promoting the \r\nestablishment of partnerships with the private sector, \r\nphilanthropic organizations and academic institutions. \r\nWe are exploring innovative financial mechanisms \r\nthat can spur the investments needed to accelerate the \r\nimplementation of the SDGs.\r\nIssues related to global economic governance, \r\ndebt sustainability and SDG financing take on even \r\nmore significance for highly indebted middle-income \r\ncountries like Jamaica, which have large public \r\ninvestment needs but limited fiscal space. Our \r\nreduced access to concessionary finance and official \r\ndevelopment assistance is a direct consequence of our \r\nmiddle-income designation. We contend that the use of \r\ngross domestic product per capita as the sole criterion \r\nto graduate countries such as ours from concessionary \r\nfinancing represents an inadequate and inaccurate \r\nmeasure of a country’s true development status.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 21/28\r\nAccordingly, middle-income countries face the \r\nrisk of having their hard-won socioeconomic gains \r\nreversed as a result of losing well-needed financial \r\nsupport, precisely at the time they need to consolidate \r\nand build on the gains they have made. We therefore \r\ncommend and thank those, including the Economic \r\nCommission for Latin America and the Caribbean \r\nand the Commonwealth Secretariat, that advocate for \r\nthe application of a broader set of indicators that take \r\naccount of the structural gaps in our countries. From a \r\nglobal perspective, it is important that the international \r\neconomic and financial architecture be aligned with \r\nAgenda 2030 and take account of that very important \r\ndistinction. Jamaica therefore urges that policymakers \r\nembed the SDGs into their design of international \r\nregulatory frameworks.\r\nJamaica looks forward to the convening later \r\nthis year of the eleventh World Trade Organization \r\nMinisterial Conference in Buenos Aires, which \r\nbrings with it the potential for advancing the Doha \r\nDevelopment Agenda. As a small island developing \r\nState with an open economy that is highly reliant \r\non foreign trade, we are dependent on a vibrant and \r\ndynamic global trading environment. We must secure \r\nimproved market opportunities beyond our shores.\r\nWe cannot, however, participate in the international \r\neconomic and trading system without correspondent \r\nbanking relations. Several international banks have \r\nwithdrawn correspondent banking services from many \r\nsmall countries, including in the Caribbean, in an \r\neffort to de-risk their client portfolios in response to \r\nstringent regulatory penalties for compliance breaches. \r\nHowever, what is viewed by international banks as a \r\nsimple balance-sheet issue has had unintended negative \r\nspill-over effects for countries in the Caribbean, with \r\nserious political and economic consequences. We call \r\nfor urgent international attention to be given to that \r\ndeepening crisis.\r\nI now turn to the issue of non-communicable \r\ndiseases (NCDs), which exact a high socioeconomic and \r\ndevelopment cost on all countries, but disproportionately \r\nso in small island developing States. Jamaica agrees \r\nthat an effective response to that global pandemic is \r\nbest addressed through multi-stakeholder partnerships \r\nin a comprehensive whole-of-Government response. \r\nWe are firmly on that path. Jamaica is addressing NCDs \r\nby promoting healthy lifestyles from birth, increasing \r\nawareness of NCDs and encouraging physical activity \r\nacross the country. We are also strengthening our \r\npolicy and regulatory frameworks to address obesity in \r\nchildhood and adulthood and other risk factors.\r\nSuch efforts should be complemented by action \r\ntaken at the global level. We therefore look forward \r\nto the 2018 high-level meeting on non-communicable \r\ndiseases and reiterate the call for greater access by \r\ndeveloping countries to the findings of modern research \r\nand technology.\r\nJamaica is committed to the empowerment of \r\nwomen and girls, and our young people. We have \r\nrevitalized our national youth parliament and created \r\na national youth advisory council to ensure that \r\nyoung people have a voice at policymaking levels in \r\nour country. We are strengthening our legislative and \r\npolicy frameworks to address violence against women \r\nand girls and to foster economic opportunities. We will \r\nalso protect our children from abuse by maintaining \r\nvigilance with respect to new and emerging threats, \r\nsuch as cyberbullying and sexual exploitation online.\r\nEarlier this year, Jamaica became a party to The \r\nHague Convention of 25 October 1980 on the Civil \r\nAspects of International Child Abduction, and enacted \r\nlegislation for its implementation. As we strengthen our \r\nnational institutional framework to address trafficking \r\nin children, we also look forward to participating in \r\nnext week’s High-level Meeting on the Appraisal of the \r\nGlobal Plan of Action to Combat Trafficking in Persons.\r\nThe movement of persons across borders is a \r\nnatural phenomenon. Migrants are an asset both to their \r\ncountries of destination and their countries of origin. \r\nJamaica highly values the contribution that our diaspora \r\nmakes to national development and to the development \r\nof their host countries. We are actively working on \r\nstrategies to deepen our engagement.\r\nConsistent with a renewed focus on placing people \r\nat the centre of sustainable development, we must not \r\nforget the plight of the refugees and persons displaced \r\nby conflict and natural disasters — occurrences not of \r\ntheir own making. Against this background, the ongoing \r\ndeliberations on the global compact for safe, orderly \r\nand regular migration take on even more significance \r\nas we move to the intergovernmental negotiations phase \r\nduring this session of the General Assembly.\r\nJamaica’s adherence to the principles of the United \r\nNations is rooted in a belief in multilateralism and the \r\nbenefits we derive from collaboration and cooperation. \r\nThe most intractable disputes require us to engage \r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n22/28 17-29813\r\ncollectively in the quest for lasting and meaningful \r\nsolutions. In this regard, we reiterate our call for an end \r\nto the economic, commercial and financial embargo \r\nagainst Cuba. This unjust embargo has restricted the \r\nability of a hard-working and self-reliant people to \r\nengage in legitimate trade, to travel and to undertake \r\ninternational financial transactions.\r\nTurning to the Middle East, we continue to believe \r\nthat the best solution to the Israeli-Palestinian crisis \r\nrests in a negotiated political settlement based on a just, \r\nlasting and comprehensive agreement that guarantees \r\nthe security of Israel and provides for a Palestinian \r\nState within internationally recognized borders.\r\nWith respect to the situation concerning Western \r\nSahara, we recall the appeal of the Security Council to \r\nall parties to show realism and a spirit of compromise \r\nto move the negotiations forward. Jamaica therefore \r\nsupports the relaunch of negotiations under the auspices \r\nof the United Nations, leading to the resumption of \r\na process with the aim of reaching a just, lasting and \r\nmutually acceptable political solution.\r\nOur collective efforts in all these political, \r\neconomic and social areas require an effective and \r\ndynamic United Nations. Jamaica therefore supports \r\nreforms that improve coordination, enhance coherence \r\nand strengthen the effectiveness of the Organization. \r\nReform measures must ensure that the United Nations \r\nremains connected to the people it seeks to serve and \r\nmust be informed by the realities on the ground in \r\nprogramme countries. They should advance all three \r\nkey pillars of the work of the United Nations: peace \r\nand security, development and the promotion of human \r\nrights. A renewed and revitalized United Nations \r\nreform effort will allow us to reap the full benefits \r\nof multilateralism.\r\nI conclude by reaffirming Jamaica’s unfailing belief \r\nin our ability as a community of nations, whose destiny \r\nand prosperity are intertwined, to make a difference in \r\nthe life of every human being. I therefore encourage all \r\nof us to be bold and unrelenting in our quest to make \r\nthis world a better place, leaving no one behind. Let us \r\ngo forward in the conviction that we can achieve peace \r\nand prosperity for our peoples and protect our planet \r\nfor the benefit of future generations.\r\nThe Acting President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mohamed Asim, Minister for Foreign Affairs of the \r\nRepublic of Maldives.\r\nMr. Asim (Maldives): We stand today at a \r\ncrossroads between old wars and new conflicts; \r\nbetween what we know and what we fear; between \r\nthe needs of a changing planet and the demands of a \r\ngrowing population. We remain caught between human \r\nambition and human limitations. In these times of \r\nchange, we must turn once again to the principles that \r\ndefine the Organization — those that make us who we \r\nare and who we would like to become.\r\nRising from the darkness of war, the United Nations \r\nshone like a beacon of light. Dedicated to seeking \r\npeace, the Organization became the purpose for many \r\nof those fighting for freedom, fighting fear and fighting \r\nfor the right to be. The United Nations was and is the \r\nbest hope we have for humankind. The United Nations \r\nwas built on the promise of peace and salvation. It is a \r\nplace where every issue can be debated for a solution \r\nand where every nation has a voice, regardless of its \r\nsize or might. That is why we believe that the theme for \r\nthis session of the General Assembly — “Focusing on \r\npeople: Striving for peace and a decent life for all on a \r\nsustainable planet” — is most appropriate. This is what \r\nmakes up the core of the Organization and what defines \r\nour work.\r\nPlease allow me to congratulate Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on his assumption of the role of President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session. I also \r\nwelcome the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, \r\nto his first general debate and commend him for the \r\ndedication he has demonstrated throughout his first \r\nyear in office.\r\nThe United Nations is what we all make of it. It is \r\nmade up of us, the Member States, and its successes \r\nand its weaknesses are determined by how much we \r\nput into it. My country, the Maldives, envisions a \r\nUnited Nations that is fair and representative of its \r\ndiverse membership, that takes into account the views \r\nand opinions of all, and that forms consensus based \r\non compromise and dialogue. We envision a United \r\nNations that commits and delivers.\r\nOur vision for a stronger United Nations is founded \r\non President Abdulla Yameen Abdul Gayoom’s policy \r\nof strengthening national resilience — economic \r\nresilience, social resilience, political resilience and, \r\nindeed, environmental resilience. It is based on crafting \r\nmeaningful global solutions, built on national policies \r\nand experiences, to the common problems of our times \r\nand for our common and shared destiny.\r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 23/28\r\nThe world must become a safer planet for all. No \r\nman, no woman and certainly no child should suffer \r\ndue to conflict, yet we know that this is not the case. \r\nFar too many people are dying in conflicts across the \r\nworld. Far too many mothers are living in fear, unsure \r\nof the fate of their children, and far too many children \r\nare seeing their futures crumble in front of them.\r\nIn Palestine, another year ends without permanent \r\npeace or permanent hope. An independent, sovereign \r\nState of Palestine with East Jerusalem as its capital, \r\nestablished along the 1967 borders, is the only \r\nsolution and the only way. Yet, many resolutions \r\nhave been adopted without action and many peace \r\nprocesses have been abandoned without progress. The \r\nshameful occupation by Israel continues, without any \r\nconsequences. Violence, economic deprivation, fear, \r\nhunger and hopelessness — these are what a child in \r\nPalestine is born into. Generations have now matured \r\nknowing nothing else. That must end.\r\nIn Syria, more than a quarter of a million people \r\nhave lost their lives, with many millions displaced and \r\nmany more millions made refugees. War crimes have \r\nbeen committed, chemical weapons used and inhumane \r\ntreatment normalized. That suffering must end.\r\nAs hundreds of innocent people continue to f lee \r\nviolence, conflict and endless suffering — in their \r\ngreatest numbers since the world wars — it has become \r\nimperative that we seek sustainable, long-term solutions \r\nthat address the well-being and welfare of migrants \r\nand refugees. Incidents of hatred, Islamaphobia and \r\nxenophobia, which have become so frequent today, can \r\nonly breed more violence, intolerance and hatred. Our \r\npolicies of fences, force and fear must end.\r\nIn Myanmar, the situation of Rohingya Muslims, \r\nwho are some of the most persecuted people in the \r\nworld, presents another tragic case. Systemic violence, \r\nincluding massacres, the torching of homes, forced \r\ndisplacement and forced migration, are acts of ethnic \r\ncleansing that are alarming, to say the least. Those \r\nresponsible for such barbaric actions must be brought \r\nto justice swiftly. Those acts of prejudice, violence and \r\ndiscrimination against Rohingya Muslims must end.\r\nInstilling fear of the other is easy. Determining \r\nothers to be worthless owing to their religion, race, \r\nethnicity, nationality, Islamaphobia or any other reason \r\nis a short step away. When that happens, it is easy to \r\nignore grave violations; it is easier to even encourage \r\nthem. It is then, and only then, that we see, as we have \r\nseen, the worst of humankind. We cannot allow another \r\nwave of genocide to recur — not on our watch.\r\nChaos, vacuum and uncertainty have given the \r\nopportunity for Da’esh to start its own brand of terror, \r\nits own version of religion and its own brutal methods \r\nof fear. Combating terrorism and fighting violent \r\nextremism and radicalization are national priorities. \r\nWe have enacted national legislation and formulated \r\na comprehensive national policy in our fight against \r\nviolent extremism. Last year, we also established a \r\nnational centre for counter-terrorism. It is a top priority \r\nfor the Maldives.\r\nThe Maldives is working with its bilateral and \r\ninternational partners, studying best practices and \r\nforging common consensuses. We commend the \r\nefforts of the Secretary-General in achieving greater \r\nglobal coordination in the fight against terrorism. The \r\nestablishment of the new United Nations Office of \r\nCounter-Terrorism, we hope, will inject more energy \r\ninto the implementation of the Plan of Action to Prevent \r\nViolent Extremism. The Secretary-General will have \r\nour full support.\r\nWe must all do more. Today, we are in the midst of \r\na war like no other. Our enemies have no single face, no \r\nsingle identity, no single country and no single strategy. \r\nThe only things they have in common are their brutal \r\nmethods and misplaced ideology. The fact that they \r\nkill more Muslims — the very people they allegedly \r\nfight to protect — proves their twisted reasoning. Such \r\nterrorism and such extremism must end.\r\nIn North Korea, the most recent tests of ballistic \r\nmissiles, and with them the real threat of nuclear \r\nweapons and war, have alarmed us all. They are a \r\nclear violation of international law and an unnecessary \r\nact of provocation. There is every possibility now \r\nthat they could lead us down the path of destruction. \r\nWe condemn those actions and urge North Korea to \r\nreturn to dialogue, let multilateralism take its course \r\nand choose peace over war. These blatant attempts at \r\naggression must end.\r\nThe world must become a more hopeful place for \r\nall — a place where people enjoy decent and meaningful \r\nlives. Adopting a proactive and constructive stand is \r\nour approach. Sustained and targeted investment is \r\nour policy. Looking to cultivate a culture of respect \r\nfor human rights, at home and abroad, is our goal. We \r\nbelieve that we have been successful.\r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n24/28 17-29813\r\nThe Gender Equality Act has guaranteed in \r\nlaw what Maldivians have been practicing for \r\ndecades — equality for women at home, at work, in \r\ndecision-making and in our society. Policies aimed at \r\nincreasing the representation of women in leadership \r\npositions are showing results. Laws, policies and \r\nregulations have created a framework in which every \r\nman, every woman, every Maldivian can be a champion \r\nfor gender equality. We need to do more, as all countries \r\ndo, but we are proud of our considerable progress.\r\nPeople with disabilities are supported through \r\nfinancial and material support. Our elderly population \r\nis getting the compassion and financial support we owe \r\nit, through well-targeted policies. Universal health care \r\nhas been realized across the country, in all 188 islands. \r\nEasy access to a medical doctor, sea ambulances and a \r\npharmacy on every island are ensured. The Maldives \r\nspends more than 9 per cent of its gross domestic \r\nproduct on health-related expenses, which is the highest \r\nin the region of South-East Asia. It is an investment that \r\nhas propelled us on our development path. Lymphatic \r\nfilaria, measles, malaria and polio are all diseases that \r\nhave been eradicated in the Maldives.\r\nAccess to safe, habitable and affordable housing \r\nis recognized as a human right in the Constitution. \r\nConsiderable progress has been made with several \r\nhousing units built and awarded under public-housing \r\nschemes, despite the scarcity of land and the remoteness \r\nof islands. Achieving near-universal literacy and \r\nuniversal enrolment in schools has not stopped us. \r\nWe are investing continually in improving the quality \r\nof our schools, our teachers, our curriculum and our \r\napproaches so as to ensure that no child is left behind.\r\nWe are also investing in our young people — the \r\nfuture of our nation. Caring for the physical, mental \r\nand social well-being of our young people — the \r\nlargest portion of our population — is a cornerstone of \r\nthe Government’s policy. We are focused on creating \r\nan enabling environment in which they will thrive \r\nand shine, including through the promotion of unity, \r\ncultural values, national identity and national spirit \r\nthrough programmes such as Tharika, launched earlier \r\nthis year.\r\nThe Maldives is a middle-income country, but like \r\nevery country we want to achieve higher growth and even \r\ngreater development. If that is to happen, large-scale \r\ninvestment is necessary. Investments are a means to \r\nsupport not only our economic development but also our \r\nsocial development. Large-scale projects will help to \r\nprovide economies of scale and facilitate the expansion \r\nof key sectors of the economy, as well as create jobs \r\nand opportunities for our youth so that their creativity \r\ncan be unleashed. Yet it has become increasingly \r\ndifficult for middle-income countries like the Maldives \r\nto access concessional financing for development \r\nprojects, thereby leaving them no other choice than to \r\naccept commercial interest rates and further increase \r\ntheir debt burdens. That will undoubtedly make the \r\ntransition from the middle-income category to higher \r\nlevels of development all the more challenging.\r\nOur successes at home provide the basis for our \r\nsolutions to the global problems that are facing our \r\nworld. Our focus globally has been to ensure that \r\nwe pay attention to the most vulnerable. That is why \r\nwe believe that focusing on those who have no voice \r\nand are not usually represented and ensuring that \r\ntheir voices are heard should be the international \r\ncommunity’s collective focus, as it was ours during \r\nthe six years we served on the Human Rights Council. \r\nAccordingly, while on the Council, we established the \r\nVoluntary Technical Assistance Trust Fund to Support \r\nthe Participation of Least Developed Countries and \r\nSmall Island Developing States in the work of the \r\nHuman Rights Council. Those two groups of countries \r\nare acutely underrepresented in Geneva. Our priority \r\ntherefore was women, children and the disabled, and we \r\ninitiated discussion on the link between climate change \r\nand its consequences on human rights. We worked \r\nhard to establish the Special Rapporteur on the issue of \r\nhuman rights obligations relating to the enjoyment of a \r\nsafe, clean, healthy and sustainable environment — a \r\nmajor global milestone.\r\nThe world must be made a happier place to live in, \r\nand that can be achieved only through our collective \r\nwill to approach our shared problems with concrete \r\nsolutions. There is no greater global threat than that \r\nposed by climate change. In 1987, when the Maldives \r\nfirst spoke about sea-level rise, the science was still \r\nnew and the threat relatively unknown. We persisted \r\nin our advocacy because we believed that the threat of \r\nclimate change deserved and, indeed, warranted global \r\nattention. The Maldives hosted the first Small States \r\nConference on Sea Level Rise in 1989. We helped \r\nestablish the Alliance of Small Island States — one \r\nof the most influential groups with regard to climate \r\nchange and sustainable development — which we have \r\nchaired since 2015. In 2008, the Maldives introduced \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 25/28\r\nthe first United Nations resolution on human rights \r\nand climate change (Human Rights Council resolution \r\n7/23), which was the first time that a United Nations \r\ndocument acknowledged that link.\r\nToday, the threat of climate change is very real. \r\nUnpredictable weather, more frequent and intense \r\nnatural disasters and unprecedented temperatures are \r\nthe norm rather than the exception. The unprecedented \r\nfrequency and the intensity of the recent hurricanes that \r\nstruck the Caribbean, the United States and the Pacific \r\nislands last year are all powerful signs that our planet \r\nhas changed significantly. Island nations, including the \r\nMaldives, are the first to be devastated by such impacts, \r\nbut we are not the only ones. Today, climate change is \r\nbecoming a reality for the rest of the world whether or \r\nnot we choose to believe it.\r\nI would like to take this opportunity to express our \r\nsincere sympathies to those who were recently affected \r\nby Hurricanes José, Irma and Maria. I assure them that \r\nwe will not stop our advocacy with regard to the effects \r\nof climate change.\r\nWe have proposed many solutions. The full \r\nimplementation of the Paris Agreement on Climate \r\nChange is our priority. The reduction of harmful \r\nemissions, transitioning to renewable sources of energy \r\nand investing in mitigation and adaptation are all \r\ncrucial. We need to join together in meaningful and \r\ndurable partnerships to find sustainable solutions. We \r\nneed constructive engagement, leadership — such as we \r\nare seeing from China, Brazil, India, Canada, France, \r\nGermany and countless others — and a certain degree \r\nof openness to change on the part of all countries, \r\nincluding developing and developed ones.\r\nAt home, we are investing in renewable energy \r\nthrough the transition to a low-carbon economy. As \r\nthe Chair of the Alliance of Small Island States, and \r\nin collaboration with the International Renewable \r\nEnergy Agency, the Maldives launched the initiative \r\nfor renewable island energy, which will facilitate \r\nsupport for small island States in their transition to \r\nrenewable energy and in achieving energy efficiency. \r\nWe are looking at innovative approaches to fulfil the \r\ndevelopment needs of our people that do not compromise \r\nthe needs of our planet. We have lent our voice and \r\nshared our experience. We have requested support to \r\nmake our economy and our country more resilient to \r\nthe shocks and impacts caused by climate change.\r\nTaking care of our ocean is intimately linked to \r\ntaking meaningful action on climate change. The \r\nMaldives and other island nations are custodians of \r\nlarge expanses of ocean. Yet every person in this Hall, \r\nevery community which they represent and every \r\ncountry they come from benefits from our oceans \r\nand depends on the health and wealth of our oceans \r\nand seas. Every other breath we take comes from the \r\nocean. In the Maldives, the ocean is the backbone and \r\nthe artery of its two main economic sectors: fishing \r\nand tourism. The ocean defines who the Maldivians \r\nare — traditional seafarers and members of fishing \r\ncommunities who rely on the produce that the ocean \r\noffers them.\r\nWe therefore welcomed and actively participated in \r\nthe first United Nations Oceans Conference, held earlier \r\nthis year, and despite the hardships, we have preserved \r\nour traditional method of pole-and-line fishing, which \r\nis the best regarded, cleanest, greenest and most \r\nsustainable method of fishing, as it is predicated on \r\ncatching fish individually with practically no by-catch.\r\nSince 2010, our entire exclusive economic zone, \r\nwhich comprises nearly 1 million square kilometres, \r\nhas been declared a shark sanctuary. As the current \r\nChair of the Save Our Sharks Coalition, we call on \r\nother countries to adopt that measure. Accordingly, an \r\nentire atoll is recognized by UNESCO as a biosphere \r\nreserve, while many other marine resources and areas \r\nare protected and preserved. In fact, there are many \r\nmore uninhabited islands with marine protected areas \r\nthan populated islands in the Maldives. That is why the \r\ntotal ban on the exploitation of ecologically significant \r\nmarine creatures — such as turtles, whales, dolphins, \r\nrays, and whale sharks — is strictly enforced. At the \r\nsame time, Maldivians are some of the most prolific \r\nconsumers of fish and marine products, thereby \r\ndemonstrating to the world that the sustainable use of \r\nmarine resources is indeed possible.\r\nWe must not forget those who suffer the \r\nconsequences of natural disasters. We are witnessing \r\nthe total destruction and loss of life resulting from the \r\nearthquake in Mexico. As the international community, \r\nwe must strive to do our very best for them and the \r\nmany others throughout the world who are suffering \r\nfrom disasters, and focus on cultivating resilience \r\nthrough better rebuilding.\r\nClimate change, sustainable development, and the \r\nprotection of our ocean are not trends or ephemeral \r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n26/28 17-29813\r\ninfatuations. Inaction will cost us our progress, \r\nprosperity, the lives of our people and the future of all \r\nour nations. This is not the time to question what we \r\nalready know. This is not the time to turn inwards or \r\nlook the other way. There is no time to waste. It is time \r\nto act.\r\nTwo days ago, we celebrated 52 proud years as \r\na Member of the United Nations. Throughout our \r\nmembership over the past five decades, we have worked \r\nwith a vision of a United Nations that protects people, \r\nproviding them with a safe haven and access to their \r\nrights; a United Nations that preserves our planet, \r\nprioritizing the needs of our present generation without \r\ncompromising those of the future; a United Nations \r\nthat promotes peace, a world free from fear and full of \r\nbright tomorrows and an abundance of hope.\r\nWe have focused on providing meaningful, \r\npragmatic and real solutions, based on sound national \r\nexperience, for our common shared destiny. It is \r\nbecause we have a meaningful vision to promote that \r\nwe continue to make every effort for the common cause \r\nof humankind. It is our firm belief in the power of \r\nmultilateralism — the same faith that propelled us 52 \r\nyears ago to seek membership of the United Nations, \r\nthe very first foreign-policy decision of the independent \r\nMaldives — that pushes us to be effective members of \r\nthe international community.\r\nIt is because we have never served before; it is \r\nbecause of the promise of equality of representation \r\nand our conviction that every nation, large or small, \r\nshould have a voice and can make a difference; and \r\nit is because of our firm conviction that size does not \r\ndetermine destiny or value that, for the first time in our \r\n52 years of membership of the United Nations, we are \r\nseeking a seat on the Security Council for the 2019-\r\n2020 term.\r\nWe stand tall and proud because we believe that we \r\nhave much to offer: fresh perspectives, fresh ideas and \r\nnew concepts that would bring renewed dynamism and \r\nnew approaches to the United Nations. The Maldives \r\ndeserves an equal chance to serve on that international \r\norgan. We are dedicated to the cause of peace in a \r\nsustainable world, and we are determined to leave a \r\nmark and make a difference.\r\nThe triumph of multilateralism, the pinnacle of \r\nour common vision, lies in our collective approach to \r\nsolving the global challenges of our time. The Maldives \r\nstands ready to take that leap of faith, providing shared \r\nsolutions for our shared, common destiny.\r\nThe Acting President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Alain Aimé Nyamitwe, Minister for \r\nForeign Affairs and International Cooperation of the \r\nRepublic of Burundi.\r\nMr. Nyamitwe (Burundi) (spoke in French): I have \r\nthe pleasure of conveying to the Assembly the most \r\nfraternal greetings of Mr. Pierre Nkurunziza, President \r\nof the Republic of Burundi. He would have liked to be \r\npresent here, but pressing commitments back home \r\nprevented him from making the journey to New York.\r\nMy delegation wishes to congratulate Mr. Miroslav \r\nLajčák on his outstanding election as President of \r\nthe General Assembly at its seventy-second session. \r\nI take this opportunity to pay a vibrant tribute to his \r\npredecessor, Mr. Peter Thomson, a worthy son of Fiji, \r\nfor a job well done.\r\nAs this is his first session of the General Assembly \r\nas head of our Organization, may I also express \r\nBurundi’s appreciation to Secretary-General António \r\nGuterres for his commitment to the values  of peace, \r\nsecurity and development.\r\nPatience is a virtue that climate change does not \r\nrecognize. The devastating effects it has fuelled have \r\npermeated virtually all conversations in this venue \r\nand ushered in this very session. The names of Irma \r\nand Maria, in the meteorological field at least, will \r\nforever connote total destruction. I therefore extend our \r\nmost sincere condolences to the countries and regions \r\nof the Caribbean that have been severely affected by \r\nthese hurricanes. We also express Burundi’s solidarity \r\nwith Mexico, stricken this week by an earthquake. \r\nWe stand wholeheartedly with all these countries and \r\ntheir peoples.\r\nThe climatic disturbances of recent times are \r\nagain sounding the alarm, urging all States to assume \r\ntheir collective duty to combat global warming and to \r\nimplement without delay the commitments of the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. We believe that no \r\nState may shirk its responsibility to that end, whatever \r\nits size, shape or place on the map of the world. We \r\nmust work together, for we are all in the same boat. If \r\nwe wish to attain the objective of containing the average \r\ntemperature rise on the planet below 2°C compared \r\nto pre-industrial levels and pursue measures to limit \r\ntemperature increases to 1.5°C vis-à-vis pre-industrial \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.21\r\n17-29813 27/28\r\nlevels, we need to act today because tomorrow will be \r\ntoo late.\r\nIn implementing the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable \r\nDevelopment, Burundi is continuing its path of social \r\ninclusion and shared economic growth. It cannot do \r\notherwise, since these two aspects are key pillars of the \r\ndevelopment policy advocated through Vision 2025. \r\nTo that end, our country counts on the cooperation \r\nof friendly States and other international partners. \r\nUnfortunately, the sanctions adopted by the European \r\nUnion against Burundi are not contributing to the \r\nrealization of these plans of great importance for the \r\nBurundian people, because they deprive the country of \r\nnecessary resources. Thus, the attainment of the 2030 \r\nAgenda and the objectives of the African Union Agenda \r\n2063 is compromised as a result of these sanctions.\r\nWe also believe that sanctions unilaterally imposed \r\nagainst developing States in general, and in Africa in \r\nparticular, should be banned from the international \r\nsystem, since they perpetuate historical injustices and \r\nviolate the sacrosanct principle of equal sovereignty. \r\nLike the African Union, Burundi therefore rejects and \r\ncondemns the sanctions imposed on Burundi and other \r\nAfrican countries.\r\nIn the field  of migration, we must work together \r\nto find solutions to the root causes of population \r\nmovements, made up mostly of young people, from \r\ncountries of the South to the North. We need to ensure \r\nconditions of humane migration in order to protect \r\nmigrants, who contribute to the well-being of the host \r\ncommunities through their multifaceted contributions \r\nto economic activity.\r\nThe apocalyptic scenes in the Mediterranean Sea \r\nstrike at our consciences as human beings. The reasons \r\nfor migration must be explained and we must all \r\nunderstand them if we are to find appropriate solutions. \r\nIt is regrettable that migration is increasingly being \r\nmet with a resurgence of racism, rejection of the other \r\nand, often, even acts of rare violence against migrants. \r\nLikewise, racist populism is becoming increasingly \r\nprominent and gradually undermining the paradigms \r\non which certain so-called advanced societies have \r\nlong rested.\r\nMigration is sometimes the result of trafficking in \r\nhuman beings. The victims are doubly affected, since \r\nin addition to being wrenched from their countries of \r\norigin, they are mistreated in the host countries. That is \r\nunacceptable. Consequently, we advocate strengthened \r\ninternational cooperation in that area so as to build a \r\nmore just world.\r\nAt the political level, our country reiterates, as it \r\nhas done repeatedly, its position in consonance with \r\nthe Charter of the United Nations. All States Members \r\nof the United Nations are sovereign Powers, and their \r\nsovereignty is equal. We call for reining in those States \r\nthat continue in the twenty-first century to believe that \r\nthey have the right to intervene in the internal affairs of \r\nother States, especially developing countries. We thank \r\nthe Security Council, which, in the case of Burundi, \r\nhas reaffirmed respect for its sovereignty in its various \r\nresolutions and presidential statements. We can never \r\nsay it enough — Burundi believes that non-interference \r\nin the internal affairs of other States and respect for \r\ntheir territorial integrity and sovereignty constitute the \r\npillars of a balanced international system under the \r\nCharter of the United Nations. Those principles are not \r\nnegotiable. Today more than ever, Burundi stands ready \r\nto defend them at any price.\r\nRecently, human rights have become another tool of \r\ndomination. As a universal concept broadly elaborated \r\nupon in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and \r\nother relevant international instruments, human rights \r\nhave been increasingly exploited by several States \r\nthat, if not mindful of their actions, will divert the \r\nHuman Rights Council from the goals entrusted to it \r\nby the General Assembly. Some members have become \r\naccustomed to obtaining, through the Human Rights \r\nCouncil and other mechanisms established by the \r\nlatter, resolutions aimed at undermining the peace and \r\nsecurity of the States that they wish to harm. The recent \r\nreport of the International Commission of Inquiry on \r\nBurundi (A/HRC/36/54) constitutes the ultimate proof \r\nof the Council’s manipulation by certain small groups. \r\nBurundi reiterates that it is ready to cooperate with the \r\nrelevant United Nations bodies, but on the condition that \r\nsuch cooperation be based on clear, fair and predictable \r\nfoundations that, above all, respect the choices made by \r\nthe Burundians themselves in the areas of governance \r\nand development.\r\nWith regard to the inter-Burundian dialogue and \r\nthe external component, only a short time ago the \r\nGovernment of the Republic of Burundi received a visit \r\nfrom the facilitation team to follow up on consultations \r\nand resume discussions. Burundi’s positions were made \r\nknown to the facilitation team. We are waiting for the \r\nfacilitation to call for the next meeting, at which the \r\ndelegations will have their voices heard.\r\nA/72/PV.21 23/09/2017\r\n28/28 17-29813\r\nBurundi has asked its refugees to return. Our \r\nappeal, which we reiterate here and now, has also been \r\nmade to neighbouring countries so as to facilitate their \r\nrepatriation. Today, the repatriation movement continues \r\napace, with the arrival of approximately 1,700 citizens \r\nwho found refuge in Tanzania and 3,000 returning \r\nfrom Rwanda. They are joining tens of thousands of \r\nothers who have returned over the past several months, \r\nas well as those who would like to return. We thank \r\nthe Office of the United Nations High Commissioner \r\nfor Refugees and the International Organization for \r\nMigration for their cooperation in facilitating those \r\nreturn movements. We take this opportunity to ask \r\nthat unscrupulous Human Rights Council officials end \r\nthe unsavoury practice of encouraging refugees not \r\nto return.\r\nAt the same time, we call on the United Nations to \r\ncontinue to monitor the situation of Burundian refugees \r\nin the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo and neighbouring countries, in full compliance \r\nwith the relevant provisions of the Geneva Conventions. \r\nWe deplore the shooting that took place a week ago in \r\nKamanyola, in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, \r\nresulting in the deaths of 38 Burundian refugees, at \r\nleast one officer of the Forces armées de la République \r\ndémocratique du Congo, and more than 120 wounded. \r\nOnce again, we invite the refugees to return home.\r\nBurundi has joined other States in combating \r\nterrorism, with 5,400 troops in Somalia within the \r\nframework of the African Union Mission in Somalia \r\n(AMISOM). Burundi has been the second-largest \r\ntroop-contributing country in Somalia for the past \r\n10 years. Burundi is concerned about the continued \r\nreduction in support for AMISOM, especially at a time \r\nwhen an important campaign has been planned. The \r\nsuccesses of the past several years cannot be sacrificed \r\nto self-interest. That would run contrary to the oath \r\ntaken by all partners, which have repeatedly stated that \r\nterrorism is a global threat.\r\nIn pursuing its contribution to world peace \r\nand security, Burundi participates in peacekeeping \r\noperations in the brotherly country of the Central \r\nAfrican Republic, and its police units are deployed \r\nin Côte d’Ivoire and Haiti. Burundi believes that the \r\nefforts and sacrifices made by others must be rightly \r\nacknowledged in all cases.\r\nIf there is one recurring topic of debate in this \r\nHall, it is that of the reform of the United Nations, and \r\nin particular the Security Council. Burundi supports \r\nall approaches aimed at fostering a constructive \r\ninteraction, open to all, between the States Members of \r\nour Organization, on the one hand, and the Secretary-\r\nGeneral on the other. Burundi supports the structural \r\nreform of the United Nations pursuant to the initiative \r\ntaken at the high-level event on 18 September. It is \r\nnecessary to consider the necessary reforms with the \r\ngoal of improving the functioning of organs including \r\nthe Security Council and the General Assembly. That \r\nwill bring the bodies concerned in line with the realities \r\nof the twenty-first century.\r\nIt is clear that by dint of pouring new wine into \r\nold wineskins, we wind up bursting the latter. We \r\nmust be firm in our conviction that, 72 years after \r\nits establishment, the United Nations is in need of a \r\ncomplete face-lift. Concerning reform of the Security \r\nCouncil in particular, Burundi supports the shared \r\nAfrican stance known as the Ezulwini Consensus. It is \r\nhigh time that we correct the injustices of the past and \r\nallow the equitable participation of all continents in the \r\ngovernance of international peace and security.\r\nWith regard to international issues, Burundi \r\nwelcomes the return of the Kingdom of Morocco to the \r\nfold of the African Union so that we can build a strong and \r\nprosperous continent together. With regard to Western \r\nSahara, Burundi supports the decisions and resolutions \r\nadopted by the relevant United Nations bodies.\r\nWe call for the unconditional lifting of the economic \r\nblockade against Cuba without delay. The Cuban people \r\nhave suffered under unjust measures that were adopted \r\nduring the Cold War era for primarily ideological \r\nreasons and can no longer be justified today.\r\nSimilarly, in the case of Venezuela, we call on the \r\ninternational community to take measures that promote \r\nnational cohesion and not social disruption.\r\nLastly, I wish the General Assembly every success \r\nat this session.\r\nThe meeting rose at 6.15 p.m.\r\n"
