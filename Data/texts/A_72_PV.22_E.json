"United Nations A/72/PV.22\r\nGeneral Assembly\r\nSeventy-second session\r\n22nd plenary meeting\r\nSaturday, 23 September 2017, 6 p.m. \r\nNew York\r\nOfficial Records\r\nPresident: Mr. Lajčák . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  (Slovakia)\r\nThe meeting was called to order at 6.15 p.m.\r\nAgenda item 8 (continued)\r\nGeneral debate\r\nThe President: I call on His Excellency Mr. Ibrahim \r\nYacoubou, Minister for Foreign Affairs, Cooperation, \r\nAfrican Integration and Nigeriens Abroad of the \r\nRepublic of the Niger.\r\nMr. Yacoubou (Niger) (spoke in French): Allow \r\nme at the outset to extend my sincere congratulations to \r\nyou, Mr. President, on your election to preside over the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-second session, as well \r\nas my best wishes for your success. I would also like to \r\ncongratulate the new Secretary-General, Mr. António \r\nGuterres, and wish him every success in his mission. \r\nThe Niger assures him of its full support.\r\nThe present session is taking place in a specific \r\ncontext, marked by the deterioration of the security \r\nsituation in some Member States and, recently, by \r\nthe destruction caused by hurricanes in others. To \r\nthose affected countries, I would like to reiterate our \r\nsolidarity and compassion. For those who have the \r\nf law of forgetting or neglecting nature, it has reminded \r\nus that often it can be indomitable and has shown us \r\nthat climate change can at times bring disaster and \r\nirremediable losses. We must therefore be aware and \r\nresolute in our conviction that new norms of production \r\nand consumption are being imposed on us.\r\nThe Niger is aware that each country is responsible \r\nfor its own development and each person for his own \r\ndestiny. However, the most vulnerable countries — I am \r\nspeaking of the least developed countries, landlocked \r\ndeveloping countries and small island developing \r\nStates — deserve the support and assistance of the \r\nmore aff luent nations. Cooperation and solidarity are \r\nessential pillars of our common Organization. It is an \r\noriginal commitment of all Member States to work \r\ntogether so that all peoples can attain a decent standard \r\nof living.\r\nThat is why, while recognizing some positive \r\ndevelopments, it is important for the States Members \r\nof the United Nations to make a greater commitment \r\nto partnership and cooperation in order to achieve \r\nthe Sustainable Development Goals and to combat \r\ninequalities among and within States. In that \r\nconnection, the Niger stresses the imperative need \r\nfor effective mobilization of the resources needed to \r\nfinance development, in accordance with the Addis \r\nAbaba Action Plan.\r\nFor its part, and to give meaning to the Niger \r\npeople’s struggle for prosperity and shared progress, \r\nthe Government of the Niger has successfully carried \r\nout the Economic and Social Development Plan 2012-\r\n2015 and has just adopted a second plan for 2017 to \r\n2021. That plan takes into account the main trends of \r\nthe Renaissance Programme Act 2 of His Excellency \r\nMr. Mahamadou Issoufou, President of the Republic \r\nof the Niger, and of the Sustainable Development and \r\nInclusive Growth Strategy, Niger 2035. It was designed \r\nto continue and amplify the Government’s efforts to \r\nface the immense challenges to our development. It is an \r\nexpression of our determination to improve, substantially \r\nThis record contains the text of speeches delivered in English and of the translation of speeches \r\ndelivered in other languages.

It also takes into account the main features of \r\nthe African Union’s Agenda 2063 and those of the 2030 \r\nAgenda for Sustainable Development.\r\nVery opportunely, that plan will be presented to the \r\nNiger’s technical and financial partners at a donor round \r\ntable in Paris from 11 to 13 December 2017, under the \r\npatronage of the President of the Republic of the Niger. \r\nThe Niger will mobilize to produce the maximum \r\namount of internal resources to finance the plan, but \r\nit also knows it can count on the active solidarity of its \r\ndevelopment partners. I therefore appeal to States and \r\nthe private sector that believe in our potential to be a \r\npartner in that project.\r\nI have just mentioned our development challenges \r\nand our responses to them. But our country and all \r\nthe countries of the Sahel face significant security \r\nchallenges. In reality, they are strategic threats that \r\nmay even jeopardize the existence of our States. The \r\nNiger is facing three hotbeds of threats.\r\nThe first is related to the situation in Libya. Without \r\na Government exercising control over the whole \r\nterritory, with dozens of militias, terrorist groups and \r\nall kinds of traffickers and a process in difficulty, the \r\nsituation is of concern not only for the Libyans but also \r\nfor neighbouring countries such as the Niger. Because \r\nof the uncontrolled movement of arms of all calibres, \r\narmed groups have become direct threats to both the \r\nLibyan people and neighbouring countries. Until that \r\ncountry is stabilized, we will have no guarantee that \r\nthe Sahelo-Saharan space will not continue to face \r\nviolent upheavals.\r\nThe Niger calls on the entire international \r\ncommunity to genuinely commit to the restoration of \r\na democratic order in Libya. The Niger has only one \r\nagenda in Libya — peace. That is why we believe \r\nthat we must already be supporting the process of \r\nrevising the Libyan Political Agreement. We call on all \r\nparties to make every effort to ensure that the Libyans \r\nthemselves are masters of their political destiny; \r\nthat reconciliation is inclusive and excludes groups \r\nterrorists; that the army is unified and national; that \r\nmilitias are disarmed and terrorist groups neutralized; \r\nand, lastly, that the referendum and electoral process \r\nis undertaken on the basis of a new constitution and \r\nconsensual electoral laws.\r\nThe second threat that we face is linked to ongoing \r\npresence of Boko Haram in the Lake Chad basin. For \r\nmore than two years, in synergy with Cameroon, Chad \r\nand Nigeria, we have been fighting hard against the \r\nterrorist group Boko Haram. That barbarous group, \r\nwhich has claimed several thousand victims, is today \r\nconsidered one of the most cruel of recent years.\r\nThanks to the Multinational Joint Task Force, \r\nwe have gained meaningful victories and fear has \r\nchanged sides. Today we have considerably reduced \r\nthe offensive and harmful capacities of Boko Haram. \r\nIt is no longer possible for that criminal organization \r\nto control and administer, as it did so easily before, \r\nany locality in any one of our countries. However, even \r\nthough they are weakened and wandering, elements of \r\nBoko Haram still remain dangerous. They organize \r\nsuicide attacks by young girls forced to become human \r\nbombs or sex slaves, and engage in racketeering and \r\nkidnappings. In that connection, I wish to recall the 39 \r\nwomen and children abducted last July in the Niger by \r\nthe terrorist group Boko Haram. The Government of \r\nthe Niger remains strongly engaged and mobilized until \r\ntheir liberation.\r\nThe third threat, and by far the most worrying for us, \r\nis the situation in northern Mali. We must resolve two \r\nquestions there. The first concerns the implementation \r\nof the Algiers peace agreements, and the second \r\nconcerns fight against terrorist groups and traffickers.\r\nFrom our point of view, the most important of \r\nthose two issues is the fight against terrorist groups \r\nand traffickers. Until they are defeated, it will be \r\ndifficult to implement the peace agreements or to hope \r\nfor the restoration of the authority of the Malian State \r\nthroughout its national territory. Therefore our primary \r\nobjective is the eradication of those groups and the \r\ndestruction of all trafficking that has become the source \r\nof their financing. That is why the member countries of \r\nthe Group of Five for the Sahel (G-5 Sahel) decided to \r\nset up a joint armed force.\r\nDespite the commitment and determination of \r\nthe G-5 Sahel member States, we remain deeply \r\nconcerned by the weak mobilization of the international \r\ncommunity to make that force operational. The Niger is \r\nconvinced that the force will make it possible to impose \r\nthe conditions for an irreversible balance of power in \r\nfavour of peace and stability in Mali and therefore \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.22\r\n17-29819 3/15\r\nthroughout the Sahel. I therefore call for a real start so \r\nthat we can make the necessary decisions. The Niger \r\ncalls on the Security Council to adopt a new resolution \r\nthat foresees a commitment of our forces under Chapter \r\nVII and to provide a mechanism for predictable and \r\nsustainable financing. Moreover, it is simply a matter \r\nof reorienting existing resources to enable the force to \r\nachieve its objectives.\r\nWhat is at stake in the Sahel is a fight not only \r\nfor the peace and security of the region, but also for \r\ninternational peace and security. Failing to help the G-5 \r\nSahel and leaving the situation in Mali to deteriorate \r\neven further would be a mistake that the Member \r\nStates should not commit. I would therefore like to \r\nthank all partners who already have announced their \r\ncontribution to the operationalization of the G-5 Sahel \r\njoint force. The Niger welcomes the recent consultations \r\nundertaken by the Secretary-General and encourages \r\nhim to continue his efforts to enable the deployment of \r\nthe force.\r\nWith regard to peacekeeping operations, is it \r\nnot time for the United Nations to question their \r\neffectiveness and to learn lessons from the shortcomings \r\nand failures observed here and there? Indeed, the nature \r\nof and actors in those conflicts have changed. We are \r\ndealing with non-State actors resorting to asymmetric \r\nactions for which peacekeeping missions are neither \r\nadapted nor prepared. That is why the United Nations \r\nMultidimensional Integrated Stabilization Mission in \r\nMali has become one of the deadliest United Nations \r\nmissions today. This it is important to review those \r\nmissions with regard to their composition, their \r\narmaments and, especially, their mandate.\r\nIn discussing the issue of terrorism and the \r\ndetermined fight that our defence and security forces \r\nare waging, I would like to say here that the Niger \r\nwill remain eternally grateful for the sacrifice of its \r\ndaughters and sons who, with courage and honour, \r\nare fighting to preserve and safeguard the integrity \r\nof our country. We are certainly paying a heavy price \r\nfor this fight, but the Niger will continue to play its \r\nrole and live up to its duty to ensure that never again \r\nwill any terrorist or criminal organization be able to \r\noccupy or take control of any part of our territory. That \r\nis why the Government will not stint on its considerable \r\nefforts to ensure that our forces take control and that \r\ntheir capacities are boosted. We will never let up in \r\nour determination, and I know we will win this war \r\nbecause our cause is noble.\r\nEvery year thousands of migrants throughout the \r\nworld put themselves in danger to seek a better life, and \r\nthe deserts and oceans of the world have become open-\r\nair cemeteries. Irregular migrants, victims of criminal \r\nsmugglers with neither faith nor law, should be protected. \r\nThe Niger, essentially a transit country, reaffirms its \r\ndetermination to fight the irregular migration networks \r\nand will continue to do everything possible to attack \r\nthe root causes of such migration. That is the meaning \r\nof the plan that our country presented at the European \r\nUnion-African Union Valletta Summit on Migration.\r\nI have mentioned the security situation in western \r\nand eastern Niger. I would like to recall here that as a \r\nresult of those conflicts, our country, although among \r\nthe poorest in the world, is hosting more than 200,000 \r\nrefugees, internally displaced persons and returnees. \r\nFor the Niger, what is most important today is to get \r\npast those emergencies so as to launch socioeconomic \r\nrecovery in the areas affected by those conflicts. We \r\nneed to move from humanitarian issues to development.\r\nTurning to certain international issues, I recall \r\nthat the Niger is in solidarity with the struggle of the \r\nPalestinian people for freedom and independence. Our \r\nposition remains unswerving support for the just and \r\ndefinitive resolution of that question, guaranteeing \r\nthe creation of a sovereign State of Palestine with East \r\nJerusalem as its capital.\r\nThe abuses against Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar \r\nare unacceptable. Such serious and massive violations \r\nof human rights must be punished. The Niger \r\nunequivocally condemns those atrocities.\r\nThe Niger, a State party to the Paris Agreement \r\non Climate Change, will respect its commitments. We \r\nare convinced that there is no alternative for saving \r\nour planet and especially for preserving it for future \r\ngenerations. The Paris Agreement is not only the \r\nrealization of our awareness, but also proof of our shared \r\nresponsibility before history. Taking a step backward \r\nis not possible unless one believes that the fate of the \r\nEarth and of humankind is not concern for everybody.\r\nThe Niger urges the United States of America and \r\nCuba to persevere in the constructive dialogue that \r\nhad begun between the two countries until relations \r\nbetween the two are normalized and the embargo is \r\nfully lifted.\r\nThe issue of disarmament is a crucial. It deserves \r\nspecial attention to enhance trust among States. The \r\nA/72/PV.22 23/09/2017\r\n4/15 17-29819\r\nNiger strongly supports the actions undertaken by the \r\nUnited Nations with a view to bringing about general \r\nand complete disarmament with regard to both weapons \r\nof mass destruction and conventional weapons.\r\nThe new challenges generated by globalization, \r\nthe transformations that have affected international \r\nrelations for decades and the need to take into account \r\nnew geopolitical dimensions, particularly in regard to \r\nAfrica, require that we deal with the crucial issue of the \r\nreform of United Nations organs. In accordance with the \r\nEzulwini Consensus, Niger calls for the composition of \r\nthe Security Council to be reviewed, for the General \r\nAssembly to be revitalized and for the United Nations \r\nto remain a democratic Organization that enshrines the \r\nsovereign equality of States, not a tiered organization in \r\nwhich the powerful and the weak have different rights.\r\nTo conclude my remarks before the Assembly, I \r\nwould like to reaffirm that at every opportunity and \r\nbefore every challenge, my country, the Niger, will \r\nalways rise to play its proper role to promote and \r\ndefend peace, to eradicate poverty and inequality and \r\nto preserve our environment. We are fully aware of our \r\nresponsibilities to change our own fate and contribute \r\nto making the world safe and better. We assume these \r\nresponsibilities fully and in a determined manner.\r\nMay God bless the Niger and the United Nations.\r\nThe President: I now give the f loor to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Elvin Nimrod, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, Legal Affairs, Carriacou and Petite Martinique \r\nAffairs and Local Government of Grenada.\r\nMr. Nimrod (Grenada): I bring warmest greetings \r\nfrom Grenada’s Prime Minister, the Honourable Keith \r\nMitchell. Prime Minister Mitchell sincerely believes in \r\nthe work of the General Assembly and is absent only \r\nbecause he believes that, as Chairman of the Caribbean \r\nCommunity, his presence in the region allows his \r\ncolleague Prime Ministers to travel to New York to \r\nplead the cases of their hurricane-stricken countries.\r\nOur hearts and prayers go out to all the victims in \r\nour Caribbean region, in Mexico and across the world \r\nwho are presently suffering the adverse effects of \r\nclimate change and natural disasters. Within the last \r\nfew weeks, our fellow members of the Organization \r\nof Eastern Caribbean States and the Caribbean small \r\nStates of Barbuda and the Commonwealth of Dominica \r\nwere ravaged by hurricanes Irma and Maria, which \r\ncaused near-total destruction and the loss of many \r\nlives. Our hearts also go out to the people of Cuba, \r\nwith whom our region shares a very special friendship. \r\nI implore the international community to recognize \r\nwithout delay our responsibility to assist all those \r\naffected by natural disasters.\r\nI join those before me in congratulating you, \r\nMr. President, on your election as President of this \r\ninternational organ. I am confident in your stewardship \r\nand assure you of my delegation’s cooperation and \r\nsupport. I also take this opportunity to commend \r\nyour predecessor, Ambassador Peter Thomson of Fiji, \r\nfor his able stewardship of the Assembly’s seventy-\r\nfirst session.\r\nI also wish to thank both you and Secretary-\r\nGeneral Guterres for your leadership and willingness \r\nto serve as guardians of the spirit of our Charter of the \r\nUnited Nations. I believe there is value in repeating \r\nyour astute and entirely relevant observation that the \r\nCharter makes only five references to war, while peace \r\nis referenced 47 times.\r\nOver the next few minutes, I will endeavour to offer \r\nGrenada’s interpretation of what it means to strive for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet, \r\nthe theme for this session.\r\nI would like to say a few words on climate change. \r\nI am sure that almost every speaker here mentioned \r\nsomething about climate change, because, as we all \r\nknow, it is a very relevant and topical subject. Certainly, \r\nbased on recent activities in the Atlantic, we just cannot \r\ndispute that the climate is changing. In fact, 97 per \r\ncent of actively publishing climate scientists agree that \r\nclimate change is due to human activities. For those \r\nwho question the veracity of that science, the cluster of \r\nextreme weather events over the past few years ought to \r\nsuffice for sounding the alarm.\r\nExtreme weather events disproportionately affect \r\nour planet’s most vulnerable, such as women, children \r\nand the elderly. Therefore, Grenada advocates that \r\nspecial attention be paid to those groups. As we assess \r\nthe physical damage caused by such disasters, let us \r\nnever forget the psychological toll they take take \r\non survivors.\r\nWe reiterate Grenada’s commitment to the Paris \r\nAgreement on Climate Change. Speaking in his \r\ncapacity as Chair of the World Bank’s Small States \r\nForum in June, Grenada’s Prime Minister lamented \r\nthe withdrawal of key partners from the Agreement. \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.22\r\n17-29819 5/15\r\nTherefore, we encourage them to reconsider. The \r\nGovernment of Grenada has adopted an ambitious Blue \r\nGrowth agenda to take advantage of our vast maritime \r\nterritory and its countless resources. Grenada aims to \r\nbe the beacon of sustainable development for maritime \r\nStates around the world. Our relatively small size \r\nmakes it an interesting and achievable project. Our \r\nBlue Growth master plan offers many opportunities \r\nfor collaboration.\r\nThe Caribbean Community (CARICOM) has \r\nemphasized the need to advance measures to develop \r\nsustainable ocean-based economies in the Caribbean. \r\nThe word “Caribbean” reminds us of beautiful beaches, \r\nsuch as the world-famous Grand Anse beach in Grenada. \r\nOur recent endeavours aim to use our maritime waters \r\nin a sustainable manner, governed by robust policies in \r\nour people’s interest.\r\nI previously alluded to the many variables that \r\ninfluence the sustainability of our planet. Small States \r\nsuch as Grenada and other CARICOM countries \r\nhave to battle to maintain our access to financial \r\nmarkets. In March, the International Monetary Fund \r\n(IMF) published a report titled, “Recent trends in \r\ncorrespondent banking relationships”, which highlights \r\nsome of the challenges facing the financial institutions \r\nand Governments of small States. Observing that \r\nthe number of correspondent banking relationships \r\nhas decreased, the IMF anticipates a negative effect \r\non global trade and economic activity this year. \r\nFurthermore, in the specific cases of Grenada and the \r\nrest of CARICOM, the high cost of compliance with the \r\ninternational tax agenda was underscored at the Ninth \r\nGeneral Meeting between the United Nations system \r\nand the Caribbean Community in July.\r\nAdded to the threat of lost correspondent banking \r\nrelationships, we also have to deal with the unilateral \r\nand often unfounded blacklisting of our institutions \r\nas money launderers and tax havens. Grenada has \r\nworked tirelessly to sign tax information exchange \r\nagreements and has signed 14 of those agreements \r\nsince 2010. It pains us as policy-makers when we \r\nexpend our limited resources to comply with rules, \r\nonly to face unjust consequences when we are quite \r\nevidently in compliance. There are no easy answers to \r\nthose challenges, but I urge our partners to desist from \r\ndraconian approaches to such matters when dealing \r\nwith vulnerable small developing States such as ours.\r\nGrenada also supports resolution 70/5, which calls \r\nfor an end to the economic, commercial and financial \r\nembargo imposed on Cuba. We also believe that \r\nrenewed dialogue may augur well for the discovery of a \r\nmutually acceptable solution for both parties.\r\nLastly, on finance, I am proud to report that \r\nGrenada’s structural adjustment programme has \r\nbeen highly commended locally, regionally and \r\ninternationally. In May, the IMF reported that\r\n“Grenada has continued with steadfast \r\nimplementation of reforms and made progress \r\ntoward achieving the key program goals.”\r\nThrough the leadership and wisdom of our Prime \r\nMinister and the sacrifices of the Grenadian people, \r\nGrenada’s economy is on solid footing today. \r\nGrenada’s thriving economy is proof that the structural \r\nadjustments are not inherently bad. Investment, both \r\nforeign and local, is at its highest levels in recent years. \r\nAlthough we are cautious to declare victory, we are \r\nvery confident that we are headed in the right direction.\r\nGrenada believes that all 7 billion of our planet’s \r\nhumans are entitled to certain fundamental human \r\nrights. The 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights \r\nis unambiguous. We should all be guided by article 1 of \r\nthe Declaration, which states that all humans are born \r\nfree and equal.\r\nOn the issue of international security, Grenada \r\ncontinues to work with our international partners \r\nin the interest of world peace. Grenada is active and \r\ncompliant numerous matters of international security. \r\nGrenada views the situation on the Korean peninsula \r\nwith great trepidation and the hope that the conflict \r\nwill be resolved peacefully. The proliferation of nuclear \r\nweapons is inherently destructive and serves no useful \r\npurpose for humankind. Therefore, Grenada urges its \r\nfriends and allies to desist from all development and \r\ntesting of such weapons. Each year, $105 billion are \r\nspent on developing nuclear weapons. That amounts to \r\naround $12 million per hour. If we are willing to make \r\nthe shift from destruction to construction, the people of \r\nBarbuda, Dominica, Cuba, Mexico and other countries \r\nsuffering from recent disasters will be forever grateful \r\nto the world.\r\nGrenada remains concerned by recent political and \r\nsocial developments in Venezuela. In his capacity as \r\nChair of CARICOM, Grenada’s Prime Minister has \r\noffered CARICOM’s help in facilitation of dialogue \r\nA/72/PV.22 23/09/2017\r\n6/15 17-29819\r\nbetween the Government and the opposition in \r\nVenezuela. CARICOM’s approach must necessarily be \r\nimpartial. CARICOM will not attempt to dictate terms to \r\neither side. We seek to encourage meaningful dialogue \r\non the premise that the Venezuelan people can come \r\ntogether to safeguard the future of all of Venezuela. In \r\nthe meantime, Grenada believes in the art of diplomacy \r\nand the principle of respect for sovereignty.\r\nTurning to matters of health, the year 2017 marks \r\nthe tenth anniversary of the landmark signing by \r\nCARICOM Heads of Government of the Port of Spain \r\nDeclaration on non-communicable diseases (NCDs). \r\nWhile some progress has been made in reducing NCDs, \r\nthere is still much work left to be done. The Caribbean \r\nregion has the highest burden of non-communicable \r\ndiseases in the Americas. Therefore, we urge key allies \r\nto continue to partner with us as we attempt to correct \r\nthat unfortunate reality.\r\nGrenada has made important progress in controlling \r\nthe spread of HIV/AIDS. Only 0.3 per cent of our \r\npopulation presently lives with the disease. The work of \r\nGrenada’s National Infectious Disease Control Unit and \r\nour health-care practitioners and policymakers must be \r\nhighly commended for their work in that regard. That \r\nwork, however, is greatly supported by international \r\nassistance that is being depleted — as it already has been \r\nin some Caribbean countries — without foreseeable \r\nreplenishment.\r\nGrenada thanks the Global Fund, the United States \r\nPresident’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, the \r\nPan American Health Organization and the German \r\nDevelopment Bank for their assistance. I urge donors \r\nto be f lexible in their relief responses. We cannot wait \r\nfor data while our people suffer. The data will come \r\neventually, but in the meantime, lives, families and \r\ncommunities are at stake.\r\nI would like to close with the assurance that \r\nGrenada believes in the United Nations system. I have \r\nhad the honour of representing the people of Grenada, \r\nCarriacou and Petite Martinique on several occasions \r\nat this noble institution. As I retire from active political \r\nlife, I am very optimistic that the window is still open \r\nfor us to leave a peaceful, habitable and prosperous \r\nplanet for future generations. The challenges of our \r\ntime are dynamic and continuous, and we would be \r\nremiss to put anything but our planet first.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Augustine Phillip Mahiga, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs, East Africa, Regional and International \r\nCooperation of the United Republic of Tanzania.\r\nMr. Mahiga (United Republic of Tanzania): I \r\ncongratulate you, Mr. President, on your election to \r\npreside over deliberations of the General Assembly at \r\nits seventy-second session. My delegation pledges full \r\nsupport to you and your Bureau.\r\nAllow me to convey warm fraternal greetings from \r\nHis Excellency Mr. John Pombe Joseph Magufuli, \r\nPresident of the United Republic of Tanzania, who \r\nwished to be here but, due to other pressing commitments \r\nat home, is unable to attend this session of the Assembly. \r\nPresident Magufuli has sent me to assure the Assembly \r\nthat his Government will continue to support the United \r\nNations and its noble mandate to promote global peace, \r\nsecurity, freedom and development. We also wish to \r\nextend Tanzania’s unwavering support and cooperation \r\nto the Secretary-General, Mr. António Guterres, as he \r\ncontinues to discharge his duties.\r\nMy delegation pays tribute to your predecessor, \r\nMr. President — His Excellency Ambassador Peter \r\nThomson — for his exemplary leadership during the \r\nAssembly’s seventy-first session. His tireless efforts \r\nin promoting the implementation of the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development, as well as his dedication \r\nto resolving the plight of refugees and migrants and \r\nreviving consultations on the reforms of the United \r\nNations, particularly of the Security Council, will \r\nremain part of his legacy. We are confident that you \r\nand your team will advance from where he left off, as \r\nyou pledged in your opening statement (see A/72/PV.1).\r\nToday, the world is facing myriad challenges, \r\nwhich include new and old threats such as international \r\nterrorism and other international crimes, persistent \r\npoverty, hunger and climate change, as well as global \r\ninequalities in economic and social status among \r\nnations. Those challenges call for a common and urgent \r\nresponse by the entire United Nations system and the \r\ninternational community as a whole.\r\nIt is in that regard that my delegation welcomes the \r\ntheme for this session “Focusing on people: Striving for \r\npeace and a decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. \r\nThe theme is timely and welcomed, as most of our \r\ncountries are adjusting their development strategies and \r\nplans to ensure the speedy and timely implementation \r\nof the Goals and targets enshrined in the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development. The striving for peace \r\nand a decent life for all on a sustainable planet should \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.22\r\n17-29819 7/15\r\nfocus on ending poverty, promoting economic and \r\nsocial prosperity, addressing inequality and injustices, \r\nand tackling the adverse impacts of climate change. \r\nThat can be achieved by successfully implementing the \r\nSustainable Development Goals (SDGs).\r\nCognizant of that fact, Tanzania has integrated the \r\nSustainable Development Goals into the second phase \r\nof our five-year development plan for 2016 to 2021, \r\nwhich focuses on industrialization, on the basis of \r\ncomplementarity between the agricultural and industrial \r\nsectors. That plan is one of our tools for the realization \r\nof our National Development Vision 2025, which \r\nseeks to bring our country to middle-income status. \r\nIn collaboration with our development partners and \r\nother stakeholders, we have developed frameworks for \r\nimplementing the SDGs, which include communication \r\nand dissemination strategies on the SDGs to make the \r\nGoals understandable to everyone. Dissemination is \r\nin both English and Kiswahili, which is our national \r\nlanguage, spoken by all Tanzanians. Sensitization \r\nworkshops on SDGs are also being conducted for \r\nregional administrations and local Government \r\nauthorities, so that the Goals can be mainstreamed in \r\ntheir local plans and budgets in order to directly involve \r\nand benefit ordinary people, who are the main focus of \r\nthe 2030 Agenda.\r\nTanzania has set a target growth from an average of \r\n7 per cent in 2015 to 10 per cent by 2020, in order to reach \r\nmiddle-income status by 2025. We also believe that \r\nsuch growth will encourage efforts to promote equality \r\nin society by reducing the unemployment rate from the \r\ncurrent 10.3 per cent to 8 per cent and will also reduce \r\nthe proportion of population below the poverty line. \r\nThat growth can be achieved by, among other things, \r\nincreasing employment in both rural and urban areas and \r\nproviding financial support through soft loans to youth \r\nand women. Other measures include strengthening \r\nsmall and medium enterprises, securing fair taxation \r\nand fiscal regimes for business entities and restoring \r\ndiscipline and accountability. Fighting corruption, \r\nfinancial discipline and accountability in all sectors are \r\nthe hallmarks of President Magufuli’s Government.\r\nClimate change has become an existential \r\nchallenge to the entire planet Earth. All parts of the \r\nworld are increasingly experiencing the adverse impact \r\nof climate change, manifested in persistent droughts, \r\nland degradation, coastal erosion, ocean temperature \r\nrise and extreme weather patterns such as cyclones, \r\ntyphoons, hurricanes and f loods. In Tanzania, for \r\ninstance, it is disheartening to witness the epic snows \r\nand glaciers of Kilimanjaro — the highest mountain in \r\nAfrica — melting at an alarming rate.\r\nAgainst that background, I would like to express my \r\nGovernment’s heartfelt sympathies and condolences to \r\nour brothers and sisters in the Caribbean, South Asia, \r\nMexico, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, the United States of \r\nAmerica and all around the world who have recently \r\nbeen victims of the disastrous impact of climate change. \r\nOur thoughts and prayers are with those who have lost \r\ntheir lives and those who have been dispossessed and \r\ndisplaced. For all of us, this should be a wake-up call \r\nand a reminder that climate change has no boundaries \r\nand can potentially wipe out economic and development \r\nachievements in the blink of an eye. Therefore, the \r\nsooner we act, the better chances we have to protect \r\nthe planet Earth for the present and future generations.\r\nIt is fortunate that we have the Paris Agreement, \r\nwhich already entered into force in November 2016, to \r\naddress this problem. To honour our joint efforts that \r\ngave birth to the Paris Agreement under the leadership \r\nof France, we should implement, in letter and spirit, all \r\nof its articles. Assistance to developing countries should \r\ngo beyond mere mitigation measures and should target \r\nadaptation measures with built-in green technologies to \r\ncontrol carbon emissions from the outset.\r\nViolent conflicts continue to plague the world \r\nand to challenge the United Nations, particularly the \r\nSecurity Council, which has the primary responsibility \r\nfor maintaining international peace and security. \r\nThey claim thousands of lives and lead to massive \r\ndisplacements and f lights of people in search of safer \r\nplaces. We need to invest more in conflict prevention, \r\nconflict resolution and mediation efforts by addressing \r\nthe root causes, the precipitating and triggering \r\nfactors of conflicts. Peacekeeping, peacebuilding \r\nand State-building are essential to the maintenance \r\nand consolidation of peace where peace has been \r\nsecured. We commend the role of the United Nations in \r\nspearheading those peace initiatives.\r\nStriving for peace should be a collective endeavour \r\ninvolving Governments, international organizations, \r\nregional blocs, non-State actors, religious groups, civil \r\nsocieties and individuals. Sustainable peace and security \r\nis prerequisite for the achievement of sustainable \r\ndevelopment. In that regard, we commend our men and \r\nwomen in Blue Helmets who are sacrificing their lives \r\nto serve the heroic cause of peacekeeping. Tanzania, \r\nA/72/PV.22 23/09/2017\r\n8/15 17-29819\r\nwith other countries, has been contributing troops to \r\nseveral United Nations peacekeeping missions. We \r\nhave paid a high price through the loss of peacekeepers \r\nserving in different missions. It is only this week that \r\nTanzania lost a soldier in the Democratic Republic \r\nof the Congo following an attack by the rebels of the \r\nAllied Democratic Forces. We condemn that cowardly \r\nact in the strongest possible terms.\r\nNonetheless, Tanzania remains steadfast and \r\ncommitted to contributing troops to United Nations \r\npeacekeeping missions. At the same time, we urge \r\nthe Security Council to continue strengthening the \r\noperational capability of the Force Intervention Brigade \r\nin the United Nations Organization Stabilization Mission \r\nin the Democratic Republic of the Congo so that it can \r\neffectively deal with negative forces and asymmetrical \r\nwarfare, which are manifesting in different war theatres \r\nin the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo.\r\nTanzania has maintained its record as a peaceful \r\ncountry upholding the rule of law, democracy and other \r\nprinciples of good governance. It has been a country of \r\nrefuge for many decades. At the same time, Tanzania has \r\nbeen actively participating in regional and international \r\npeace initiatives, including the ongoing Burundi peace \r\nprocess, which has been supervised by the East African \r\nCommunity, facilitated by the former President of \r\nTanzania, Mr. Benjamin William Mkapa, and mediated \r\nby His Excellency President Yoweri Museveni of \r\nUganda. The peace talks are still on track, although \r\ntheir pace is slow and halting. It is encouraging to note \r\nthat in some parts of Burundi, the security situation has \r\nsignificantly improved to permit the voluntary return \r\nof some 12,000 refugees of the almost 250,000 refugees \r\nwho have been in Tanzania since 2015. We appreciate \r\nthe partnership we have had with the United Nations \r\nHigh Commissioner for Refugees in protecting and \r\nassisting the refugees in our country.\r\nTanzania has also for decades been receiving \r\nand hosting refugees from pockets of troubled areas \r\nin the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo. We trust that there will be full implementation \r\nof the 31 December 2016 peace agreement, with the \r\npromise of timely elections in that country. We urge \r\nthe leadership of the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo to live up to that commitment and to issue an \r\nelection calendar soon. In that connection, we urge the \r\ninternational community to extend both logistical and \r\nfinancial support to the Democratic Republic of the \r\nCongo so that it can complete the registration of voters \r\nand expeditiously carry out the planned elections.\r\nOn the agenda of the General Assembly and the \r\nSecurity Council, there are two protracted problems \r\nthat require decisive action. One is the issue of the self-\r\ndetermination of the Sahrawi people. With the return \r\nof Morocco into the African Union fold, expectations \r\nare high in Africa that negotiations on that issue, which \r\nis on the agenda of the Security Council, will receive \r\nrenewed momentum and urgency.\r\nOn Palestine, we support the two-State solution — two \r\nStates living side by side in peaceful coexistence. To \r\nthat end, the elements of a viable State of Palestine \r\nmust be ensured and respected. The long-stalled peace \r\nprocess in the Middle East must be rekindled with a \r\nseries of acceptable confidence-building measures by \r\nboth sides with the support and guarantee of the United \r\nNations and the international community in its entirety.\r\nIn the Assembly, we have been calling for the \r\ncessation of economic, commercial, fmancial and \r\nother embargoes imposed on Cuba, without significant \r\nresults. The intention of the United States to reverse the \r\nagreements between the two countries on normalizing \r\nrelations is a setback to the progress that had been \r\nregistered and applauded by all of us in the Assembly \r\nand beyond. Tanzania continues to call for the total \r\nremoval of all embargoes on Cuba. The people-to-\r\npeople contact that has started between the peoples of \r\nboth Cuba and the United States should serve as building \r\nblocks for enduring peaceful good-neighbourliness in \r\nthe spirit of dialogue and understanding.\r\nAfter the end of the Cold War, there was a new \r\ndawn and bright prospects for both conventional \r\nand nuclear disarmament. The doctrine of nuclear \r\ndeterrence was becoming obsolete, negotiations for the \r\nreduction of nuclear arsenals were making progress \r\ntowards a nuclear ban treaty, including nuclear testing, \r\nand some aspirants to nuclear weapons abandoned \r\ntheir ambitions.\r\nHowever, the recent developments in the Democratic \r\nPeople’s Republic of Korea have shattered these \r\noptimistic prospects. The world is being dragged back \r\nto nuclear brinkmanship. This is the most recent threat \r\nto international peace and security. Tanzania supports \r\nall relevant resolutions of the Security Council on the \r\nnuclear-weapons trends in the Democratic People’s \r\nRepublic of Korea and calls for de-escalation of the \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.22\r\n17-29819 9/15\r\npolitical warfare and propaganda, and for the renewal \r\nof dialogue under the auspices of the Six-Party Talks.\r\nOn the other hand, Tanzania commends the recent \r\nadoption of the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear \r\nWeapons, which puts nuclear weapons on the same \r\nlegal ground as other weapons of mass destruction. \r\nWe should all support the Treaty in order to increase \r\nour moral authority in the fight against nuclear-\r\nweapons proliferation.\r\nThe reforms of the United Nations to make the \r\nOrganization more efficient and relevant in order to \r\ncope with new trends and challenges must be continuous \r\nand progressive. The latest initiative of the Secretary-\r\nGeneral is a commendable effort that should have \r\nreceived consensual support from the entire United \r\nNations membership. We hope that, in the process of \r\nimplementing these latest reform proposals, the debates \r\nwill be all-inclusive and progress will be made on the \r\nbasis of consensus among the entire membership of the \r\nUnited Nations.\r\nThe delay in Security Council reform is indeed \r\ntesting the political will of the key players on this \r\nserious matter, and the debate has now become routine \r\nand sterile. The status quo is undercutting the primary \r\nresponsibility of the Council for the maintenance of \r\ninternational peace and security. Democratizing the \r\nSecurity Council is good for the Council and for the \r\nworld in the twenty-first century.\r\nIn conclusion, I wish to return to the 2030 Agenda \r\nfor Sustainable Development by making a clarion \r\ncall to the United Nations and its Member States to \r\nimplement the goals contained therein, in measured \r\nand agreed benchmarks and intervals. The economic \r\nand social benefits of well-implemented goals will \r\nenhance democracy, freedom and security at the \r\nnational, regional and international levels, leaving no \r\none behind.\r\nThe President: I now call on His Excellency \r\nMr. Mark Anthony Brantley, Minister for Foreign \r\nAffairs and Aviation of Saint Kitts and Nevis.\r\nMr. Brantley (Saint Kitts and Nevis): I bring \r\ngreetings from the Government and the people of the \r\nFederation of Saint Kitts and Nevis. I wish at the outset \r\nto congratulate you, Sir, on your election as President \r\nof the General Assembly at its seventy-second session \r\nand to assure you of my delegation’s full support as you \r\ncarry out your duties.\r\nPermit me also to extend congratulations to His \r\nExcellency Mr. Peter Thomson, President of the \r\nGeneral Assembly at its seventy-first session. President \r\nThomson ably steered the deliberations on many pressing \r\nmatters during this past year. As a representative of \r\nFiji, he proved once again that small island nations \r\ncontinue to make significant contributions to matters \r\nof global relevance.\r\nI also extend a warm welcome to Secretary-General \r\nGuterres as he assumes leadership of the Organization. \r\nHis Excellency has come to the helm at a critical time \r\nin our collective history, and we are confident that his \r\ncompetence, coupled with his political and diplomatic \r\nexperience, will enable him to chart the course of the \r\nOrganization towards a sustainable and peaceful future \r\nfor all. I assure His Excellency of my Government’s \r\nfullest support and commitment.\r\nMy delegation also expresses appreciation to \r\nformer Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon for his sterling \r\nservice and wishes him well in his future endeavours.\r\nThe world has gathered here in New York at the \r\nseventy-second session of the General Assembly under \r\nthe theme “Focusing on people: Striving for peace and \r\na decent life for all on a sustainable planet”. The theme \r\nis comprehensive, yet simple; concise, yet inclusive; \r\nand it encompasses pivotal and pertinent areas for \r\ninternational reflection at this critical juncture in \r\nour history.\r\nPermit me to begin where the theme \r\nends — a sustainable planet. I choose to do so because \r\nof the experience that I and members of our Caribbean \r\ncivilization had immediately prior to leaving our \r\ncountries to attend this session of the General Assembly. \r\nIn the space of two weeks, we braced ourselves for the \r\nthree hurricanes Irma, Jose and Maria. Two of these, \r\nIrma and Maria, descended on our region as category \r\n5 hurricanes and, in the case of Irma, as the most \r\npowerful storm in recorded history in the Atlantic. I \r\npause to reflect on the fact that the hurricane season \r\nof 2017 is not yet over and that the Caribbean will face \r\nsimilar threats each and every year.\r\nIn the aftermath, we were faced with the tragic \r\ndestruction of life, property and infrastructure in \r\nAntigua and Barbuda, Anguilla, Saint Barthélemy, \r\nSaint Martin, Sint Maarten, the British Virgin Islands, \r\nthe United States Virgin Islands, Cuba, the Turks and \r\nCaicos islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, \r\nGuadeloupe and Dominica. Irma then made landfall \r\nA/72/PV.22 23/09/2017\r\n10/15 17-29819\r\nin Florida in the United States, where, like Hurricane \r\nHarvey before it in Texas and Louisiana, millions of \r\npeople were subject to damage and destruction.\r\nI have highlighted the various countries and \r\nterritories that suffered the most devastation, but my \r\nown beloved country of Saint Kitts and Nevis was not \r\nwithout injury. We, too, saw damage to our power grid, \r\nour roads, our agriculture and fisheries sector and to \r\nthe homes of our people. Indeed, on 19 September, the \r\nday we should have been celebrating the thirty-fourth \r\nanniversary of our independence as a nation, Saint \r\nKitts and Nevis was locked down under assault from \r\nHurricane Maria.\r\nThe carnage in a wide swath of the Caribbean \r\nis unimaginable. Lives have been lost, homes and \r\ninfrastructure destroyed, economies reduced to tatters, \r\nand years of development wiped out; in the case of \r\nBarbuda, an entire island was evacuated and rendered \r\nuninhabited and uninhabitable for the first time in 300 \r\nyears. It is worthy of note that the carnage caused by \r\nHurricanes Irma and Maria took but a few days. In just \r\na few days and in many countries a mere few hours, \r\nthe world had front-row seats to the most horrific \r\ndestruction ever seen in our beloved Caribbean region.\r\nWe have in this Hall heard the Prime Minister \r\nof Antigua and Barbuda speak solemnly of the utter \r\ndestruction of Barbuda (see A/72/PV.14). It was \r\nonly today that we stood in anguished silence as the \r\nPrime Minister of Dominica recounted the near total \r\ndestruction of his beautiful country and the tragic loss \r\nof life (see A/72/PV.19). Their first-hand accounts \r\nwould move even the coldest hearts to tears.\r\nWe today extend our deep condolences to our \r\nbrothers and sisters and continue to keep them in our \r\nprayers. But even as we do so, we also remember the \r\nvictims of the three horrific earthquakes in Mexico \r\nand those in Japan and New Zealand. Our thoughts and \r\nprayers are also with the Governments and the peoples \r\nof those countries.\r\nThe time has now come for the world to treat these \r\nphenomena not as natural disasters but as the man-made \r\ndisasters that they are. The science is irrefutable. Our \r\noceans continue to get warmer due to our continued \r\nabuse of our planet Earth. Warmer oceans feed and \r\ncreate horrific storms such as Irma and Maria. Now \r\nmore than ever, we bear witness to the compelling need \r\nto support the call for a reduction in greenhouse-gas \r\nemissions and all other actions and behaviours that \r\naggravate the effects of climate change.\r\nClimate change for us in the Caribbean is not a \r\nmatter for academic rumination. The humanitarian \r\ncrisis unfolding in the Caribbean in the wake of \r\nHurricanes Irma and Maria is stark testimony to the \r\nfact that climate change is not only real but poses an \r\nexistential threat to our peoples, our countries and our \r\ncivilization. The world has deliberated and negotiated. \r\nWe have made commitments and signed multiple \r\nagreements, most recently the Paris Agreement on \r\nClimate Change, but the time for more urgent, concrete, \r\ntangible and collective action is now.\r\nIt is the most cruel irony of our times that we in \r\nthe Caribbean, who are least responsible for climate \r\nchange, are the ones most disastrously affected by it. \r\nWe are not major polluters, but we bear the brunt of the \r\neffects of pollution. In every sense, small vulnerable \r\nStates like Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica and my own \r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis continue to be asked by the world \r\nto cash a cheque we did not write. In order to attain a \r\nsustainable planet, those most responsible for climate \r\nchange through their greenhouse gas emissions and \r\nother environmentally harmful practices must shoulder \r\nthe responsibility of arresting and ameliorating the \r\nconsequences. We cannot continue to abuse our planet \r\nand expect to remain unscathed.\r\nThe people of Saint Kitts and Nevis call upon the \r\nglobal community to pledge itself to pursue renewable \r\nenergy with greater alacrity. We must invest in better \r\nand stronger homes and buildings. We must grow our \r\neconomies to allow us greater financial resilience \r\nand f lexibility. The people of Saint Kitts and Nevis \r\nand of our Caribbean deserve and demand the same \r\nfundamental right to life and security of our way of life \r\nas others anywhere else. I ask the global community to \r\nlend its collective voice so that together we can create \r\na glorious symphony for change — change that will \r\nensure a sustainable planet for all. In this regard, I call \r\non the community of nations to mobilize the resources \r\nnecessary to ensure the speedy reconstruction of those \r\ncountries devastated by Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\r\nMy delegation unreservedly condemns the sterile \r\nanalysis of gross domestic product per capita, which \r\nhas been used by international agencies to tell our \r\nsmall island developing States that we are now middle- \r\nand high-income countries and therefore locked out \r\nof accessing development assistance or affordable \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.22\r\n17-29819 11/15\r\nfinancing. It is a travesty and a tragedy for the world \r\ncommunity to witness such destruction caused by \r\nforces entirely outside the control of Caribbean nations \r\nand then refuse to allow those very nations access to \r\nthe resources necessary to rebuild. There has to be a \r\nmore sensible and just model that takes into account the \r\nspecial vulnerability of small island States.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis therefore joins others in \r\ndemanding that a vulnerability index be developed \r\nas part of the matrix for accessing development \r\nassistance. We of the Caribbean, already caught in the \r\ndebt trap, cannot be forced to borrow commercially at \r\nhigh interest rates to rebuild destroyed lives after each \r\ndisaster. This is and must be a moral imperative for us \r\nall in the wake of the destruction seen in the Caribbean.\r\nAnd rebuild we must. Countries such as Dominica \r\nhave no safe zones or other geographic areas to which \r\npopulations can be relocated. A hurricane of the scale of \r\nIrma and Maria devastates entire countries. We of the \r\nCaribbean are a proud and resilient people. The world \r\nmust not stand by and allow the evils of climate change \r\nto force Caribbean people to become climate refugees. \r\nWe must rebuild, and we require the community of \r\nnations to partner with us in this rebuilding effort.\r\nIn the fight against the disastrous effects of climate \r\nchange, allow me to commend the work of many \r\ninternational agencies and organizations, as well as \r\nnon-governmental actors. My country is especially \r\nheartened by the work being undertaken by the \r\nCommonwealth and its leadership. It follows that if we \r\nare to achieve a sustainable planet, it requires an all-\r\nhands-on-deck approach. From the onset, there must \r\nbe buy-in from all stakeholders. No one should be left \r\nout, and therefore this calls for inclusiveness, unity and \r\nappreciation of the input and contributions that all can \r\nmake to achieving the world we want.\r\nThis brings me to the first part of our \r\ntheme — focusing on people. There can be no debate \r\nthat our people are our primary resource. It is no \r\nmarvel, therefore, that Governments allocate a large \r\npercentage of their budgets to developing their human \r\ncapital and expend great effort to ensure that they meet \r\nthe basic needs of their populace. Governments that fail \r\nto provide for their people and that ill-treat, abuse and \r\noppress their people must be rightly ostracized by the \r\ninternational community.\r\nOur world comprises all kinds of people, but I wish \r\nto highlight the youth — a sector of all our populations \r\non which the global community must increase its focus. \r\nI commend the United Nations on its unflinching \r\nefforts to draw attention to our youth. Indeed, it was \r\nmore than two decades ago that the General Assembly \r\nadopted the World Programme of Action for Youth to \r\nthe Year 2000 and Beyond.\r\nYoung people constitute 18 per cent of the global \r\npopulation. Young people and children together \r\naccount for nearly 40 per cent of the world’s population. \r\nYoung people are not just our future; they are our \r\npresent. Globally, Governments must do all they can to \r\nprovide institutions and opportunities for learning and \r\ndevelopment, create employment and prepare young \r\npeople for and steer them towards entrepreneurial \r\nendeavours. But Governments cannot do it alone. We \r\ntherefore use this forum to call upon the business \r\ncommunity, as well as non-governmental agencies \r\nand actors, to provide our young people with viable \r\noptions and opportunities for gainful employment and \r\nsocial and economic advancement. We cannot speak of \r\nattaining the Sustainable Development Goals without a \r\nfocus on our youth.\r\nA vital element of a sustainable planet is peace. \r\nIt behoves us all, nations great and small, to work \r\ntowards the achievement of that essential universal \r\nvalue. Regrettably, while in some countries citizens \r\nare forced to engage in a daily struggle for survival, \r\nbraving the scorching sun and bitter cold to labour for \r\nless than $1 per day, other countries are expending \r\nbillions of dollars on developing weapons of war \r\nand mass destruction. While some Governments are \r\nallocating large sums to secure a future for their women \r\nand young people, others are investing in tools of war. \r\nWhile the budgets alone of some Governments will be \r\ninadequate to achieve the Sustainable Development \r\nGoals, others are using multiple times those budgets \r\nin developing nuclear warheads. In order to attain a \r\nsustainable planet, our priorities must be synchronized, \r\nharmonized and synergized. Our goal must be the \r\npreservation and conservation not only of our natural \r\nresources, but also of our human resources.\r\nMy delegation condemns unreservedly the actions \r\nthat have led to heightened tensions on the Korean \r\npeninsula and calls on all countries to respect and \r\nhonour their solemn commitments under international \r\nlaw. We condemn all actions that encourage violence \r\nand disrupt peace. There can be no place in today’s \r\nworld for war and violence. We therefore join the \r\nA/72/PV.22 23/09/2017\r\n12/15 17-29819\r\ninternational community in demanding diplomacy and \r\ndialogue instead of sabre-rattling and warmongering.\r\nSaint Kitts and Nevis stands proudly with our \r\nCaribbean and Latin American neighbours as a zone \r\nof peace and exhorts all members of the community \r\nof nations to expend every effort to create and \r\npromote peace.\r\nThe theme of the current session makes a clarion \r\ncall not only to strive for peace, but also to strive \r\nfor a decent life for all. No boy, no girl, no man, no \r\nwoman, no person should be left behind. We must work \r\ntogether to reduce poverty and hunger, promote justice \r\nand equality, and ensure that our people have access to \r\nhealth care and economic opportunity. In that global \r\neffort, we must be inclusive and each and every country \r\nmust be allowed to play its part. No one nation can do \r\nit alone. Human suffering anywhere is human suffering \r\neverywhere. We must build partnerships and ensure the \r\ncontribution of all the populations of our planet Earth. \r\nAll must be allowed to sit at the table of brotherhood and \r\ncontribute to finding lasting solutions to the problems \r\nthat we face.\r\nIn that regard, we call on the international community \r\nyet again to look at our dear friend, Taiwan — a modern \r\ncountry of 23 million people that has had tremendous \r\nsuccesses in technology, agriculture, health, and \r\nrenewable energy; a country that is a model of peace \r\nand security. Saint Kitts and Nevis has experienced \r\nfirst-hand the benefits of partnership with Taiwan. \r\nThere is much that it can offer, and we lose collectively \r\nwhen we seek to isolate and prevent our fellow nations \r\nfrom having a seat at the international table. Saint Kitts \r\nand Nevis continues its unwavering support for the \r\nGovernment and the people of the Republic of China on \r\nTaiwan to be included in the United Nations and other \r\ninternational agencies. There is much that we can learn \r\nfrom Taiwan, and we can no longer afford to ignore the \r\nvoices of its 23 million people.\r\nIn equal measure, we call yet again for the \r\nlifting of the more than 50-year embargo against our \r\nCaribbean sister Cuba. The Cuban people are a noble \r\npeople who have demonstrated their resilience despite \r\ninsurmountable odds. Their leadership in health and \r\nhumanitarian assistance to Africa, the Caribbean and \r\nLatin America is well known. The Cuban people ask \r\nonly to be given a fair chance to live their lives in \r\ndignity and peace.\r\nIn closing, I acknowledge that the task ahead of \r\nnavigating the many complex issues of the international \r\ncommunity will not be easy. However, we remain firm \r\nbelievers in collective strength and collective effort. \r\nThe journey to a sustainable planet and a future for all is \r\nattainable. Throughout history, we have achieved more \r\ntogether than we have ever achieved alone. Whether \r\nwe are small islands; land-locked, mountainous, \r\ndesert or ice-capped States; whether we are super-\r\nPowers or powerless, we are all better and the United \r\nNations becomes a better Organization when we work \r\ntogether. Alone we can do little, but together we can \r\nachieve much.\r\nThe challenges that we face globally — from climate \r\nchange to refugees to war and violence — require urgent \r\naction now. The world does not have the luxury of time. \r\nWe have talked. We have debated. We have postulated \r\nand hypothesized. We have studied and analysed. We \r\nmust now act. In that regard, I can find no more elegant \r\nprose than that of American civil-rights leader, Martin \r\nLuther King, Jr., who said:\r\n“We are now faced with the fact that tomorrow \r\nis today. We are confronted with the fierce urgency \r\nof now. In this unfolding conundrum of life and \r\nhistory, there is such a thing as being too late. This \r\nis no time for apathy or complacency. This is a time \r\nfor vigorous and positive action.”\r\nThe President: We have heard the last speaker in \r\nthe general debate for this meeting.\r\nI shall now call on those representatives who wish \r\nto speak in exercise of the right of reply. May I remind \r\nmembers that statements in exercise of the right of \r\nreply are limited to 10 minutes for the first statement \r\nand to five minutes for the second, and should be made \r\nby delegations from their seats.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): I would \r\nlike to speak in exercise of the right of reply in response \r\nto the statements delivered by the representatives of \r\nSaudi Arabia and Bahrain.\r\nBoth delegations accused Qatar of terrorism. \r\nQatar has an excellent record in counter-terrorism \r\nand ranks high in that regard. Such allegations allude \r\nto a link between Qatar and terrorism. Those claims \r\nare false, baseless and part of the unlawful campaign \r\nagainst Qatar that started with hacking and piracy. \r\nOther Member States took similar steps against Qatar \r\nand resorted to religious rhetoric to back their claims. \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.22\r\n17-29819 13/15\r\nThose countries are now frustrated and use commercial \r\nmeans to pressure Qatar.\r\nIn response to the statement of Saudi Arabia, I \r\naffirm that the State of Qatar has spared no effort in \r\nstrengthening international action against terrorism. We \r\nare a principled member of various counter-terrorism \r\nforums and coalitions, including the Global Coalition \r\nagainst Da’esh and the Global Counter-Terrorism \r\nForum. Qatar participated in a summit between Islamic \r\ncountries and the United States of America and was \r\namong the first countries to implement the outcomes \r\nof that summit. We have also signed a memorandum \r\nof understanding with the United States to stop \r\nfunding terrorism.\r\nWe tell those countries that accuse Qatar of \r\nsupporting terrorism that they ought to follow our \r\nexample. The State of Qatar has fully implemented \r\nthe relevant Security Council resolutions. Our record \r\nhas been commended in a number of United Nations \r\nreports, which stress the constructive role that Qatar \r\nis playing to support the United Nations in sustaining \r\npeace and providing humanitarian and development \r\nassistance, which promotes stability and contributes to \r\neradicating terrorism.\r\nThe statement delivered by the representative \r\nof Bahrain included a number of contradictions. \r\nIt is truly surprising to hear the representative of \r\nBahrain, who used to commend Qatar, now turn to \r\ncriticizing it. Bahrain’s experience affects the stability \r\nof the entire region. We reject the claims made in \r\nBahrain’s statement, which are refuted by our excellent \r\nrecord and our commitment to the Charter of the United \r\nNations and stability in our region.\r\nIt is very surprising to hear Bahrain accuse us of \r\nterrorism. We call on the Kingdom of Bahrain to work \r\ntirelessly to overcome its own internal problems. To \r\nthat end, it should respect human rights and implement \r\nUnited Nations resolutions. It should also refrain from \r\nmarginalizing sectors of its own population and f louting \r\nthe rule of law. It needs to be very objective in dealing \r\nwith its own internal problems. Fabricating problems \r\nand conflict with the State of Qatar to obscure its own \r\ndomestic problems will not yield positive results.\r\nThe illegal steps taken against Qatar are \r\nunacceptable. Is it conceivable or reasonable to prevent \r\nstudents from attending to their studies? Is that not \r\na violation of their human rights? The same might \r\nbe asked of legislation that threatens citizens with \r\npunishment simply for expressing their sympathy with \r\nQatar? Such rhetoric fuels the campaign against Qatar. \r\nHow can counter-terrorism succeed when we fuel \r\nsuch rhetoric?\r\nMs. Lodhi (Pakistan): I take the f loor to exercise \r\nPakistan’s right of reply to a statement in the general \r\ndebate earlier today (A/72/PV.19) in which the Foreign \r\nMinister of India indulged in an orgy of slander \r\nagainst my country. Her comments towards Pakistan \r\nbetrayed the hostility of the Indian leadership towards \r\nPakistan — hostility that we have endured for 70 long \r\nyears. Repeating falsehoods year after year does not \r\nand cannot conceal or alter the truth.\r\nBut in her vitriol, India’s Foreign Minister \r\ndeliberately ignored the core issue of Jammu and \r\nKashmir. Let me be clear. Jammu and Kashmir is not \r\na part of India. It is recognized by the United Nations \r\nand the international community as disputed territory. \r\nI invite the Assembly and the Indian Foreign Minister \r\nto look at the United Nations maps. Therefore, India’s \r\nmilitary occupation of the state is illegal. The Security \r\nCouncil has, in more than a dozen resolutions, decided \r\nthat the dispute must be resolved by enabling the people \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir to determine their own destiny \r\nthrough a United Nations-supervised plebiscite.\r\nIndia accepted these United Nations resolutions, but \r\nhas avoided implementing them through obfuscation, \r\ndiversion, deceit and aggression. India’s brutal \r\noccupation of Kashmir has killed more than 100,000 \r\ninnocent Kashmiri children, women and men. Today \r\nthis campaign of brutality continues, including the \r\nshooting and blinding of innocent Kashmiri children \r\nwith pellet guns. Yet every day these Kashmiri children, \r\nwomen and youth come out on the streets to demand \r\nthat India get out of occupied Kashmir.\r\nIndia cannot hide behind semantics. Any inter-State \r\ndispute like that surrounding Kashmir is by definition \r\nan international dispute. If the parties fail to resolve \r\na dispute, the United Nations and the international \r\ncommunity have not only the right but the obligation \r\nto intervene and help resolve the dispute. In the case \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir, that obligation is explicit \r\nsince the Security Council has been involved with this \r\ndispute since its very inception and has prescribed \r\nvery specifically and precisely how the dispute should \r\nbe resolved.\r\nSecurity Council resolutions do not lapse with \r\ntime, nor are they “overtaken”, as the Indian Foreign \r\nA/72/PV.22 23/09/2017\r\n14/15 17-29819\r\nMinister put it. Law has no expiry date and morality has \r\nno sell-by date. India’s posture is that of the predator. \r\nIt cannot escape its legal and moral obligation to abide \r\nby the resolutions of the Security Council. Any other \r\ninterpretation will open the door to the logic of force in \r\ninternational relations.\r\nIndia now also refuses a bilateral dialogue with \r\nPakistan, whether composite or comprehensive. The \r\ncondition it imposes that first there must be an end \r\nto violence begs the question. Violence emanates \r\nfirst and foremost from India’s occupation and brutal \r\nsuppression of the people of Kashmir. Under the \r\ncircumstances, my Prime Minister has proposed that \r\nthe Secretary-General appoint a special representative \r\nor special envoy, as several of his predecessors did, to \r\npromote the implementation of relevant provisions of \r\nthe Security Council resolutions.\r\nAt the same time, the United Nations should also \r\ntake steps to investigate India’s ongoing and massive \r\nviolations of human rights in Kashmir and the impunity \r\nenjoyed by India’s security forces, lift the draconian \r\nemergency laws and punish those responsible for the \r\nwar crimes and genocide in Kashmir. If the international \r\ncommunity wishes to avoid a dangerous escalation \r\nbetween India and Pakistan, it must call on India to halt \r\nits provocations and aggressive actions. It must end the \r\nceasefire violations along the Line of Control. It must \r\nhalt its sponsorship of terrorist groups inside Pakistan.\r\nIndia’s Foreign Minister has spoken much about \r\nterrorism. The United Nations should actually define \r\nterrorism, and in that definition we should include \r\nState terrorism. The Indian National Security Advisor \r\nhas boasted how this State terrorism is being sponsored \r\nby India’s spy agencies in my country, in what he has \r\ncalled a “double-squeeze strategy”.\r\nPakistan has in its custody an Indian spy and \r\nintelligence officer, Kulbhushan Jadhav, who has \r\nconfessed to India’s support of terrorist activities in my \r\ncountry. In fact, India has considerable experience in \r\nthe State sponsorship of terrorism in our region. It has \r\nsponsored and perpetrated terrorism and aggression \r\nagainst all its neighbours, creating terrorist groups, \r\ndestabilizing and blockading neighbours to do its \r\nstrategic building, and sponsoring subversion, sabotage \r\nand terrorism in various parts of Pakistan. All this \r\nestablishes the fact that India is the mother of terrorism \r\nin South Asia.\r\nIndia’s proclivity for violence is also no secret. \r\nIn the 70 years since its independence, India has \r\nbeen engaged in at least a dozen-plus instances of \r\nthe use of force and continues to face 17 insurgencies \r\nin its own land. It has fought a war with or within \r\neach of its neighbours. The Indian Foreign Minister \r\nsought to denigrate my country’s founding father, the \r\nQuaid-e-Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. All I can say \r\nabout India’s current political luminaries is that they \r\nbelong to a political organization that has the blood \r\nof thousands of Muslims of Gujarat on their hands. \r\nToday, that so-called democracy is the world’s largest \r\nhypocrisy. That is the face of India’s democracy.\r\nIndia is ruled by a Government in which a \r\nracist and fascist ideology is firmly embedded. The \r\nleadership of this Government emanates from the \r\nRashtriya Swayamsevak Sang, the same extremist \r\ngroup accused of assassinating Mahatma Gandhi. It is \r\na Government that has appointed a fanatic as the Chief \r\nMinister of India’s largest state, whose rallying cry to \r\nhis mobs was: “If they kill even one Hindu, we will kill \r\n100 Muslims”. It is a Government that has allowed the \r\nlynching of Muslims.\r\nAll this is amply documented by international \r\nhuman rights organizations. Indeed, as one of India’s \r\nmost famous contemporary authors recently said,\r\n“These horrific murders are only a symptom \r\nof a deeper malaise. Life is hell for the living too. \r\nWhole populations — millions of Dalits, Adivasis, \r\nMuslims and Christians — are being forced to \r\nlive in terror, unsure of when and from where the \r\nassault will come”, [and that] “[m]uch of what is in \r\nthe air in India now is pure terror, in Kashmir, in \r\nother places”.\r\nThe Indian Foreign Minister spoke about human \r\nrights, so let me ask: who is using pellet guns that are \r\nblinding unarmed protesters, including children and \r\ninfants, in occupied Kashmir? Who is violating the \r\nfundamental rights, not only of the brave people of \r\nKashmir, but of hundreds of millions of Indians? Who \r\nis using rape as an instrument of terror and of State \r\npolicy to crush a popular and indigenous movement in \r\nthe occupied state of Jammu and Kashmir?\r\nIn conclusion, let me say that Pakistan remains \r\nopen to resuming a comprehensive dialogue with \r\nIndia to address all outstanding issues, especially that \r\nof Jammu and Kashmir, and to discuss measures to \r\nmaintain peace and security. But this dialogue must \r\n23/09/2017 A/72/PV.22\r\n17-29819 15/15\r\nbe accompanied by an end to India’s campaign of \r\nsubversion and State-sponsored terrorism in Pakistan.\r\nMs. Mohamed (Bahrain) (spoke in Arabic): In \r\nresponse to the Qatari allegations, I assert that the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain and its brethren in Saudi Arabia, \r\nthe United Arab Emirates and Egypt — supported \r\nby several other countries — have exercised their \r\nsovereign right, in accordance with international law, \r\nto impose measures against Qatar, which violated an \r\naccord that, when violated in part, is considered to have \r\nbeen violated as a whole. The Kingdom of Bahrain has \r\nevidence that the State of Qatar violated that agreement \r\nand interfered in the internal affairs of the Kingdom \r\nin order to foment chaos and overturn our domestic \r\nrulings. Qatar is also threatening the social fabric \r\nof Bahrain by according Qatari nationality to many \r\nBahraini families.\r\nSince the boycott was first imposed by our four \r\ncountries, Qatar has spread false allegations that we \r\nare violating the human rights of our citizens, although \r\nQatar knows that the four countries, including the \r\nKingdom of Bahrain, have taken measures to ensure \r\nthat all humanitarian cases — whether with respect to \r\neducation, health care or any other urgent matter — are \r\ngiven due consideration. The measures taken by our \r\nfour countries are sovereign matters. Any country has \r\nthe right to do so under international law.\r\nIf we are to talk about contradictions, Qatar refutes \r\nits own allegations about the boycott by claiming that \r\nit is not impacted thereby, that it is enjoying economic \r\ngrowth and other similar claims. That is Qatar’s right, \r\nbut it should not behave one way and then act in an \r\nentirely contradictory fashion. Qatar is seeking to exploit \r\ninternational forums for its own political interests.\r\nThe Kingdom of Bahrain has suffered a great \r\ndeal under the policies of Qatar, which spurns good-\r\nneighbourliness despite our family ties. However, the \r\nState of Qatar has sought and continues to seek to \r\nfoment chaos and instability in Bahrain by supporting \r\nmilitias and terrorist groups, either through espionage, \r\nfinancing or its media, which it has exploited especially \r\nsince 2011 in order to spread false news and create chaos \r\nin Bahrain through more than 800 falsified broadcasts. \r\nIt is hiding behind freedom of expression and freedom \r\nof the media, well aware that the Kingdom of Bahrain \r\nhas a long-standing record of respect for freedom of the \r\nmedia. We have a democratic system and a fully elected \r\nParliament that, thanks to recent amendments, is able \r\nto carry out all its functions.\r\nNo such achievements exist in the State of Qatar. \r\nIts Constitution is riddled with f laws. It does not have a \r\nParliament. We are not trying to compare Bahrain and \r\nQatar. This is an internal affair and, unlike Qatar, we do \r\nnot interfere in the internal affairs of others. We wish \r\nthe people of Qatar well, but we believe that reform is \r\npart of the democratic process. We remind our brethren \r\nin Qatar that it is easy to accuse others, but they should \r\nfirst look to themselves before looking at others.\r\nMr. Al-Khalifa (Qatar) (spoke in Arabic): We \r\nregret that Bahrain has attacked Qatar. Its allegations \r\nagainst us are false. Unjust measures have been taken \r\nagainst Qatar, in violation of human rights, freedom of \r\nexpression and the Global Counter-Terrorism Strategy, \r\nwhich is based on respect for human rights. One cannot \r\ncounter terrorism without respecting human rights.\r\nWe have been accused of funding terrorism, but \r\nthere is no substantiated evidence for these claims. \r\nThese four countries have provided no evidence \r\nbecause there is no such evidence. Qatar is better than \r\nall four countries combined in the field of counter-\r\nterrorism. The boycott, of which Bahrain is a part, has \r\nled to violations of human rights, such as the separation \r\nof families. Some countries have even enacted laws \r\nto prosecute citizens who express their sympathy \r\nfor Qatar.\r\nAny allegation that Qatar has intervened and \r\ninterfered in the internal affairs of these four countries \r\nis false and intended to obscure the fact that those four \r\ncountries are interfering in our internal affairs and \r\nhave launched campaigns that threaten the unity of \r\nthe Qatari people. Against this background, we have \r\nadvised these four countries to pay greater attention to \r\ntheir own unity and their own respect for human rights. \r\nRespect for human rights is the only guarantee for the \r\nstability of countries. To ensure the stability of the \r\nGulf, we need cooperation among the Gulf States.\r\nAs we are not able to speak a third time in exercise \r\nof the right of reply, we shall submit further comments \r\nin writing.\r\nThe meeting rose at 8 p.m.\r\n"
